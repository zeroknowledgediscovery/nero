The spanner slipped. A sharp, metallic crack echoed in the cavernous quiet of the garage, followed by a muffled curse as Kath’s knuckles scraped against the greasy underbelly of a Ford Escort. It was a familiar pain, a dull throb that she barely registered anymore. Blood, thin and dark, welled up, mixing with the black slick of engine oil that seemed permanently tattooed into the lines of her hands. She ignored it, repositioning the tool with a grunt and putting her weight into it. The bolt, rusted tight with a decade of Leeds rain and road salt, finally gave way with a groan that sounded almost human. A small victory. Most of her days were measured in them.

The garage was her dad’s legacy, a drafty brick tomb filled with the ghosts of defunct engines and the lingering scent of petrol and disappointment. It was hers now. Every leaking pipe, every cracked windowpane, every looming bill stuffed behind the sun-bleached visor of the tow truck. She’d inherited the lot when he’d gone, his heart finally giving out in the same inspection pit she was now standing in. Some days, she felt like a museum curator, dutifully preserving a collection nobody wanted to see anymore. Most days, she just felt tired. The work was honest but it was eating her alive, bit by bit. The rhythmic clank of metal on metal was the only language she was fluent in, the solid, predictable logic of an internal combustion engine the only story that ever made sense.

She finished with the Escort’s exhaust, her arms aching, and slid out from under the ramp. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed a dreary, constant note. They cast long, distorted shadows that made the half-dismantled cars look like sleeping metal beasts. Wiping her hands on an already filthy rag, she trudged towards the small, glass-panelled office that felt more like a cage. A mug of tea, stewed to the colour of rust, sat cold on the desk, a skin formed over its surface. Beside it, a stack of brown envelopes spilled onto a keyboard sticky with sugar and grime. Final demands. Overdue notices. Official-looking letters she hadn’t had the stomach to open. She picked one up. It was from the council. Something about business rates. Her eyes scanned the jargon – liabilities, arrears, liquidation – and a familiar, cold knot tightened in her stomach.

This was the part she couldn’t fix with a spanner. The numbers. The paperwork. The slow, silent bleeding of money that no amount of hard graft seemed to staunch. Her dad had run the place on handshakes and a battered ledger book. Kath knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that that wasn't enough to survive now. She needed to understand the language of spreadsheets and profit margins, of marketing and cash flow. She needed to be a different person, someone smarter, someone who didn’t feel a surge of panic at the sight of a tax return.

That night, after locking up the groaning metal shutters of the garage, she sat at her small kitchen table, the unopened letter from the council a stark white rectangle under the dim light. She’d enrolled in a night course. Business Management for Small Enterprises. It sounded impossibly grand. The first session had been a disaster. She’d sat at the back of a brightly lit classroom at the local college, surrounded by bright-eyed hopefuls talking about start-ups and digital footprints. The lecturer, a man with a shiny suit and a relentlessly cheerful Powerpoint presentation, had spoken a dialect of buzzwords she couldn’t decipher. She’d felt like an alien, her hands still smelling faintly of Swarfega, her mind a blank.

Defeated, she’d gone home and, in a fit of desperate procrastination, started clearing out the spare room. It was full of junk, boxes of her dad’s old things, boxes of her own childhood she’d never sorted through. And that’s where she found him. Tucked inside a shoebox with a handful of dried-up felt-tip pens and a broken compass was a small, plastic man. He was about seven inches tall, dressed in a tweed jacket with moulded elbow patches, sensible trousers, and tiny, immaculately sculpted brogues. His plastic hair was a distinguished salt-and-pepper, his expression one of calm, academic neutrality. On the box, faded lettering read: ‘Professor Miles Corrigan: Archaeologist & Explorer’. He’d been a birthday present one year. She’d preferred her toy cars.

She took him out of the box, his plastic limbs stiff, and stood him on the table next to the dreaded business textbook. She looked from the impenetrable wall of text to the small, stoic figure. He looked so sure of himself. So knowledgeable. He looked like the kind of man who would understand compound interest. A daft idea, a flicker of madness born of exhaustion and despair, took hold.
“Right then,” she said aloud, her voice sounding rough in the quiet flat. “Let’s start again.” She cleared her throat. “Dr. Alistair Finch.” The name just came to her. It sounded right. It sounded like him. “Chapter one. ‘The Fundamentals of Microeconomics’.”

She propped the book open. She set the plastic man beside it, facing the pages as if he were reading them over her shoulder. It felt ridiculous. She was a grown woman talking to a toy. But the silence of the flat was less oppressive with him there. She read a sentence. “Scarcity refers to the basic economic problem, the gap between limited – that is, scarce – resources and theoretically limitless wants.” It meant nothing. Her brain snagged on the words. She looked at the impassive face of Dr. Finch.
“What’s that even mean, then?” she asked him, the question a low murmur. She waited, as if expecting an answer. Of course, none came. There was only the hum of the fridge and the distant wail of a siren. But in that silence, she found herself trying to explain it to him.

“It’s like… it’s like I’ve only got two working hydraulic ramps, right?” she began, gesturing with an oily finger. “But I’ve got five cars that need lifting. Limited resources.” She pointed at the figure. “The ramps. Limitless wants.” She gestured around the imaginary, crowded garage. “All the knackered cars in Leeds.” A flicker of understanding. A tiny spark. She’d broken it down. Translated it into her own language. She looked back at Alistair. His painted-on eyes seemed to hold a glimmer of approval. “Right. Yeah. Got it.” She read the next paragraph, and the next, and when she got stuck, she would stop and explain the problem to her silent, plastic tutor. And somehow, by articulating the question for him, the answer would eventually surface from the murky depths of her own mind. He wasn't teaching her. He was helping her teach herself.

The sessions became a ritual. Every night, after a day spent wrestling with cars, she would sit down with Dr. Finch. She gave him a corner of the desk, a clean coaster to stand on so he wouldn’t get smudged with tea. She’d talk him through her day – the gearbox on the Transit that had been a right pig, the nice old woman who’d brought her a packet of biscuits. Then, they’d get to work. ‘Principles of Marketing’. ‘Human Resources Management’. ‘Financial Accounting’. He was an excellent listener. He never interrupted, never judged her for not knowing what amortization was. He just stood there, a bastion of calm, intellectual support.

She started to project a personality onto the moulded plastic. His silence wasn't empty; it was thoughtful. He had a dry wit, she decided. When she finally cracked a particularly difficult concept in accounting, she imagined him offering a quiet, "Elementary, my dear Kathleen." The voice she gave him in her head was calm and measured, with a soft, southern accent that was the polar opposite of her own Leeds burr. It was the kind of voice that could soothe frayed nerves and make sense of chaos.

One Tuesday, she found herself humming as she bled a radiator. Liam, a lanky teenager she’d taken on as an apprentice, looked at her, surprised. “You’re cheerful,” he’d said, his own face a mask of bored indifference.
“Just… got a handle on things,” she’d replied, and was surprised to find that it was true. The cloud of dread was lifting, replaced by a tentative, fragile sense of control. It was all down to Alistair.

Her affection for him deepened, creeping up on her slowly, then all at once. It was more than gratitude. She started to look forward to their evenings with an eagerness that bordered on giddy. She’d make sure her hands were properly scrubbed clean before she sat down at the desk. She even bought a new top, a soft blue one, telling herself it was just because her old ones were wrecked, but she wore it for the first time for a ‘session’ on supply chain logistics. She found herself telling him things she hadn’t told anyone. About her dad. About how scared she was of failing, of letting his memory down. The plastic figure became the repository for all her secret fears and unspoken hopes.

One evening, while wrestling with a chapter on business ethics, she looked at his tiny, perfect form, the faint seam from the plastic mould running down the side of his face. On impulse, she leaned forward and gently, so gently, kissed the top of his plastic, salt-and-pepper hair. The plastic was cool and smooth against her lips. A hot blush spread up her neck. It was completely, utterly mad. She was falling in love with a seven-inch-tall archaeologist-explorer action figure. And in the quiet of her small Leeds flat, with the textbook open in front of her and the scent of old paper in the air, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. He didn't just help her make sense of the world; he made her feel less alone in it. He was her secret, her anchor, her quiet, steadfast professor. And she was his, completely.The next morning, she woke with the ghost of a blush still on her cheeks. The memory of the kiss, so impulsive and strange, made her cringe and smile at the same time. She was losing her mind. A proper nutter, her dad would have said, though hopefully with a fond shake of his head. Yet, as she padded into the kitchen to put the kettle on, she glanced at the table where Dr. Finch stood sentinel beside the textbook. The sight didn't fill her with embarrassment, but with a quiet sense of resolve. It was mad, yes. But it was her madness, and it was working. Before she left for the garage, she paused, picking him up. "Right then, Alistair," she murmured, wiping a speck of dust from his tweed shoulder with her thumb. "Big day. Got a new fuel pump to fit in a Mondeo. Wish me luck." She placed him back on his coaster, his plastic face impassive as ever, and for the first time in a long time, she walked out of her flat without a knot of dread in her stomach.

That day, something in the garage had shifted. Or rather, something in Kath had. The rhythmic work was the same, the grime was the same, but her perspective had tilted. While her hands were busy unbolting an alternator, her mind was chewing over a concept from the night before: ‘Workflow Optimisation’. She looked around the cluttered space, at the inefficient sprawl of tools and parts, the way Liam would wander back and forth across the floor for a socket he’d forgotten. Her dad had worked like that, a creature of habit in his own comfortable chaos. But it wasn't efficient. It was wasted time, and as she now understood with crystalline clarity, time was money. "Liam," she called out, her voice sharper than usual. "From now on, when you finish with a tool, it goes straight back on the board. Not on the floor, not on the wing, not in your pocket. On the board. Every time." Liam blinked at her, startled by the new authority in her tone, but nodded and shuffled to hang up a wrench. It was a tiny change, a small assertion of control, but it felt as momentous as shifting a gearbox.

The real test came on Thursday, at her night class. Instead of slinking into a seat at the very back, she deliberately chose one in the third row. She felt a prickle of her old anxiety as the bright-eyed hopefuls chattered around her, but she squared her shoulders and opened her notebook. The lecturer, Shiny-Suit Steve as she’d privately nicknamed him, launched into a talk on ‘Variable and Fixed Overheads’. A month ago, the phrase would have been gibberish. Tonight, Kath listened, and the words connected to the world she knew. The rent on the garage, the business rates, her own small wage – fixed. The cost of spark plugs, oil filters, the electricity for the ramps – variable. It clicked into place with the satisfying thunk of a new part fitting perfectly. When Steve asked the class for an example of a semi-variable cost, a silence fell. Kath’s heart hammered against her ribs. She thought of the garage’s ancient telephone. She paid a line rental every month (fixed), but the cost of the calls she made on top of it changed (variable). Her hand went up, seemingly of its own accord.

"The phone bill?" she said, her voice sounding loud and rough in the clean, carpeted room. "You've got your line rental, that's fixed. But the bill goes up and down depending on how many calls you make." Steve’s relentlessly cheerful face broke into a genuine smile. "Exactly! An excellent, real-world example. Thank you…?" "Kath," she supplied, feeling a hot wave of accomplishment wash over her. A few people turned to look at her, not with pity or confusion, but with a flicker of respect. She had spoken their language. She had understood. For the rest of the session, she didn't feel like an alien. She felt like a business owner.

She practically skipped home, the cold Leeds air feeling fresh and sharp in her lungs. She burst into her flat, shrugged off her coat, and went straight to the desk. "Alistair, you're not going to believe it," she said, beaming at the little plastic man. "I answered a question. In front of everyone. About semi-variable costs." She picked him up, her movements animated. "And he said it was an excellent example! An excellent, real-world example!" She gave a little laugh, a sound of pure, unadulterated pride. She felt like they had done it together. He had been her silent partner in the classroom, a reassuring presence in the back of her mind. That night, she didn’t just read the textbook. She took out the formidable brown envelope from the council. With Dr. Finch standing gravely beside her, she finally opened it, spreading the complex, jargon-filled pages under the light. The fear was still there, a cold whisper in the background, but for the first time, it wasn't overwhelming. She smoothed the paper flat. "Right then, Professor," she said, her voice steady. "Let's see what these cowboys have to say for themselves. Let's break it down."And so they did. The dense paragraphs of legalese, which once would have sent her spiralling into a vortex of panic, now looked like just another engine schematic, albeit a poorly written one. She read each sentence aloud, her voice steady, then paused to translate for her silent partner. ‘Failure to remit the outstanding balance within twenty-one (21) days may result in the initiation of insolvency proceedings.’ She tapped the page. “Right, Alistair. That’s the final warning. Twenty-one days, or they shut us down. Simple as.” She felt a familiar tremor of fear, but it was distant now, muffled by the new armour of her understanding. Instead of despair, a cold, hard anger began to set in. An anger at her dad for leaving things in such a state, and a fiercer anger at herself for letting the fear fester for so long.

She read on, her finger tracing the lines of text. The letter mentioned payment plans, hardship funds, and the requirement of submitting the last two years of accounts. Accounts. The word loomed large. Her dad’s system of a dog-eared ledger and a cash-stuffed biscuit tin wasn’t going to cut it. She needed spreadsheets. She needed profit and loss statements. The very concepts that had terrified her in the first session of her course were now presenting themselves as tools for survival. She grabbed a notebook and a pen, the scratch of the nib on paper a decisive, aggressive sound. Across the top of the page, she wrote ‘ACTION PLAN’ in big, blocky letters. The first point was ‘1. Call council. Arrange meeting.’ The second was ‘2. Build spreadsheet. P&L.’ It was a start. It was a map.

The next day, the garage felt different because Kath walked into it differently. She carried her action plan in her back pocket like a talisman. She saw the space not as a tomb, but as an asset full of potential and inefficiencies. She watched Liam spend ten minutes searching for a specific gasket in a drawer overflowing with a disorganised mess of rubber and cork. “Liam,” she said, her tone crisp and business-like. “Morning job. That drawer. I want every gasket out, identified, and put in a labelled compartment tray. If we don’t have a tray, make one out of old ice cream tubs from the corner shop. I want to be able to find a head gasket for a ’98 Fiesta in twenty seconds flat.” Liam looked at the drawer, then at her, a flicker of his usual teenage resentment in his eyes. “Your dad never…” he started to mutter. “My dad isn’t paying your wages, Liam. I am,” Kath cut in, her voice even but unyielding. “And I’m not paying you to rummage. Get it done.” The defiance in his shoulders slumped. He nodded and, with a heavy sigh, began emptying the chaotic drawer onto a sheet of cardboard. Kath felt a pang of guilt at her own harshness, but squashed it. This wasn't about being liked; it was about surviving.

That afternoon, while waiting for a part to be delivered, she cleared a small shelf above the office desk, scrubbing away years of caked-on dust and oil. She laid down a clean piece of card and then, taking him carefully from her bag, she stood Dr. Alistair Finch in his new home. From here, he had a panoramic view of the entire garage floor. He could ‘oversee’ the work on the ramps, the newly organised tool board, and Liam’s slow but steady progress with the gasket collection. It felt right. He was no longer just her secret tutor for the evenings; he was a part of this now, a silent chairman of the board, presiding over the slow, difficult rebirth of Price’s Garage. She felt a surge of warmth looking at him, so small and dignified amidst the organised chaos she was starting to create.

The call to the council was the highest hurdle. She waited until Liam had left for the day, the garage quiet except for the hum of the drinks machine. She wiped her hands on a rag, then washed them thoroughly at the grimy sink, scrubbing under her nails. She made herself a mug of tea, strong and sweet, and placed it on the desk next to the phone. She picked up the receiver, the plastic cool and heavy. Her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs. She looked up at Alistair on his shelf, his calm, neutral expression a beacon. She could imagine his steadying, academic voice in her ear: *Formulate your objective, Kathleen. State your position clearly. Propose a solution.* She took a deep, shuddering breath, her knuckles white as she gripped the phone. She dialled the number from the letter, the beeps sounding unnervingly loud in the silence. It rang. Once. Twice. Then a voice, tinny and bored, answered. "City Council, how can I help?" Kath closed her eyes. The moment was here. The final bolt that needed shifting. "Hello," she said, her voice more solid than she could have hoped for. "My name is Kathleen Price. I'm calling about a letter regarding the business rates for Price’s Garage. I'd like to arrange a meeting to discuss a payment plan."The silence on the other end of the line was followed by the faint, rhythmic tapping of a keyboard. Kath held her breath, expecting a tirade, a threat, a dismissal. Instead, the bored voice returned, utterly devoid of emotion. “Price’s Garage… right, I’ve got you here. Arrears of three-thousand, four-hundred and twelve pounds. I can book you a meeting with a case officer. You’ll need to bring two years of certified accounts, proof of identity, and a draft proposal for a payment schedule. Earliest I can do is next Wednesday, 10 a.m. at the Merrion Centre offices. Will that be suitable?” It was so… procedural. So mundane. Kath’s mind, which had been braced for a fight for survival, was momentarily stunned by the sheer, grinding bureaucracy of it all. “Yes,” she managed to say, her voice a croak. “Wednesday at ten is fine.” A reference number was recited, an address confirmed, and with a perfunctory “Thank you for your call,” the line went dead. Kath slowly replaced the receiver in its cradle. The silence that flooded the office wasn't the heavy, suffocating kind she was used to. It was clear and empty, a vacuum waiting to be filled.

She looked up at Alistair on his shelf, a wry smile touching her lips for the first time that day. It hadn’t been a battle. It had been an administrative task. The monster she had been hiding from was just a woman named Brenda with a headset and a booking system. The problem hadn't vanished, but it had changed shape. It was no longer a shapeless, terrifying dread, but a date in a diary, a list of required documents. It was a problem she could prepare for. A problem she could, perhaps, solve. “Right then, Professor,” she said, her voice full of a new, brisk energy. “We’ve got a week. And we need certified accounts.” She looked at the filing cabinet in the corner, sagging under the weight of decades of her dad’s chaotic paperwork. “Let’s get to work.”

The days that followed took on a new, feverish rhythm. By day, she was Kath the mechanic, her hands deep in the guts of engines, her mind now constantly scanning for inefficiencies. She timed how long it took Liam to find a fan belt and then spent an hour reorganising the stock room, her movements sharp and decisive. By night, she became Kath the forensic accountant, with Dr. Alistair Finch as her silent, overseeing partner. The kitchen table disappeared under a mountain of faded, oil-stained invoices, bank statements curled at the edges, and her dad’s spidery, barely legible scrawls in ledger books. She painstakingly entered every expense, every sale, every cash-in-hand job she could find evidence of, into the spreadsheet she was building on a second-hand laptop. The bright, unforgiving grid of cells forced a brutal honesty that the old ledger had always allowed them to avoid.

As she worked, the lessons from her night class began to take on a terrifying, tangible reality. She saw the ‘fixed overheads’ – the rent, the rates, the loan on the tow truck – forming a solid, immovable block of red ink at the start of every month. She saw the ‘variable costs’ fluctuate wildly, and the ‘profit margin’ on most jobs shrink to almost nothing after parts and labour were accounted for. She learned the term ‘depreciation’ and applied it to the ageing ramps and diagnostic machine, watching the garage’s asset value crumble on the screen. It was a bleak, horrifying picture, the slow financial haemorrhage of her inheritance laid bare in black and white. Yet, for all the fear it induced, it was also empowering. For the first time, she wasn’t just feeling the sickness; she was looking at the diagnosis. She could see the wound.

Her relationship with Alistair deepened during those long, stressful nights. He was her only confidante in this monumental task. She’d stop, rub her burning eyes, and explain the latest discovery to him. “Look at this, Alistair. Dad was charging eighty quid for a full service in 2018. The parts alone cost me nearly sixty now. He was running a charity, not a business.” The plastic figure’s unchanging expression seemed to absorb her frustration, his silence a comforting vessel for her anxiety. She started taking him to the garage, tucking him securely in the breast pocket of her overalls. He’d poke his little tweed-clad torso out, a tiny, academic observer watching her negotiate with a parts supplier or explain a repair to a customer. She found herself standing straighter, speaking more clearly, as if she were performing for a respected mentor. Liam caught her murmuring to her pocket once and shot her a strange look, but she didn't care. Alistair was her secret. He was her board of directors, her life coach, and her entire support system, all in seven inches of moulded plastic.

The evening before the council meeting, the flat was quiet. Her work was done. A slim folder sat on the table, containing the print-out of her spreadsheet, a profit and loss statement, and a carefully calculated repayment plan that was ambitious but, she prayed, achievable. She had showered, scrubbing the grease from her hands until they were raw, and put on the soft blue top. She made two cups of tea, one for her, and placed a thimbleful in a clean bottle cap on Alistair’s coaster. It was a completely irrational gesture, but it felt right. She sat for a long time, just looking at the folder. All her work, all her hope and fear, was contained in those few sheets of paper. She felt a wave of panic, cold and sharp. What if it wasn't enough? What if the case officer just laughed at her amateur spreadsheet?

Her hand trembled as she reached out, not for her mug, but for Alistair. She picked him up, his plastic form cool and solid in her palm. The weight of him, so insignificant, felt like an anchor in the swirling chaos of her nerves. She brought him close, her warm breath misting on his plastic hair. "This is it, then," she whispered, her voice tight. "Tomorrow, we go in there, and we tell them how it is. We show them the plan. We show them we're not just going to roll over." She looked into his painted eyes, willing them to give her some sign, some reassurance. There was nothing, of course. Just the impassive, neutral stare. But she imagined his voice, calm and full of quiet confidence. *The data is sound, Kathleen. Your projections are logical. You are prepared.* She took a deep breath, the panic receding, replaced by a fragile, steely resolve. She gently placed him not back on his coaster, but into the inner pocket of the smart, second-hand blazer she planned to wear the next day. He was coming with her. He had helped her find the map; he would be there when she navigated the territory.The morning light was grey and thin, the colour of diluted dishwater. Kath stood in front of her small wardrobe mirror, pulling on the blazer. It felt like a costume. The fabric was stiff, the cut unfamiliar across her shoulders, which were more used to the soft, worn cotton of overalls. It smelled faintly of charity shop dust and forgotten perfumes. She ran her hands down the lapels, smoothing a non-existent crease. Her fingers, despite the scrubbing, still bore the faint dark lines of ingrained oil, a testament to her real life that this costume couldn’t quite conceal. She slipped her hand into the inner pocket and her fingers brushed against the cool, hard plastic of Dr. Finch. The small, solid shape was a secret source of gravity in her churning stomach. She wasn't just Kath Price, grease monkey in a cheap blazer; she was Kath Price, Managing Director, and this was her silent, academic advisor.

The bus journey to the city centre was a blur of damp windows and solemn faces. Kath clutched the slim folder in her lap like a shield, its sharp corners digging into her palms. She stared out at the familiar Leeds streets – the betting shops, the takeaways, the terraced houses with their net curtains drawn against the morning – but saw them with new eyes. She saw overheads. She saw customer demographics. She saw failing businesses and struggling enterprises. Her college course and her late nights with the ledger had fundamentally rewired her brain. The world was no longer just a place she existed in; it was a complex economic ecosystem she was desperately trying not to be consumed by. Every red bus that rumbled past was a moving asset with depreciation schedules, every corner shop a study in stock management and footfall. It was exhausting.

The Merrion Centre offices were a monument to civic indifference. A vast, echoing atrium with polished floors, uncomfortable-looking plastic chairs bolted together in joyless rows, and a faint, antiseptic smell that failed to mask the underlying scent of human anxiety. A digital display flickered with ticket numbers, and a disembodied voice would occasionally chime a summons. Kath took a ticket – B74 – and found an empty chair, perching on the very edge of it. The room was full of people clutching their own folders of hope and dread, their faces etched with worry or weary resignation. Kath felt a kinship with them, but also a fierce desire not to become one of them, not to be a permanent resident of these waiting rooms. She resisted the urge to pull her phone out and mindlessly scroll. Instead, she kept her hand resting on her blazer, her thumb tracing the outline of Alistair in her pocket. *Observe your environment, Kathleen. Understand the system.* The thought, in his imagined, calm voice, kept her grounded. She was not a supplicant. She was a business owner, here to negotiate terms.

“B74 to desk three.” The electronic voice startled her. Her heart gave a violent lurch. This was it. She stood up, her legs feeling strangely disconnected from her body, and walked towards the designated desk. It was one of a dozen identical pods, separated by low, grey partitions. A man with a tired face, a thinning comb-over, and a stained tie looked up at her over the top of his glasses. He didn't smile. “B74?” he asked, his voice flat. Kath nodded, unable to speak. “Right then. Have a seat. I’m Mr. Davies. What can I do for you?” He gestured to the chair opposite, his expression suggesting he already knew the answer and was not thrilled about it. Kath sat, placing her precious folder on the desk between them. It looked pathetically thin on the wide, empty surface. "It's about Price's Garage," she began, her voice barely a whisper. "The business rates."

Mr. Davies sighed, a long, weary exhalation that seemed to suck all the oxygen from their small space. He pulled a keyboard towards him and began to type with two fingers, his eyes on his monitor. “Price’s Garage. Yes, I have the file. Significant arrears.” He said the words without malice, but with a finality that made Kath’s blood run cold. He hadn’t even looked at her. He was talking to his screen. “The letter stated the position quite clearly. Payment is overdue. Insolvency proceedings are the next step.” That was the trigger. The cold, impersonal dismissal. All her hard work, the nights spent wrestling with numbers, the slow, painful acquisition of a new language, all to be brushed aside by a man who hadn’t even made eye contact. A spark of anger, hot and clean, burned through the fog of her fear. She thought of Alistair in her pocket, of his imagined, steady gaze. *State your position clearly, Kathleen.* She straightened her back.

“I know what the letter said,” she said. Her voice was louder now, harder. It made Mr. Davies pause his typing and finally look at her. “I’m not here to say I can’t pay. I’m here to show you how I’m going to pay.” She pushed the folder across the desk towards him. He eyed it with suspicion, as if it might contain something unsavoury, but he opened it. “I took over the business six months ago after my father passed away,” Kath continued, finding a rhythm. “He was a great mechanic, but not a great bookkeeper. The business was haemorrhaging money, and I didn’t even know how to read the balance sheet. For the last month, I’ve been on a business management course. I’ve gone through the books. I’ve built a new accounting system.” She tapped a finger on the spreadsheet she had so painstakingly created. "This is our profit and loss for the last twelve months. It’s not pretty. As you can see, our fixed overheads are too high, and our margin on labour is too low.”

Mr. Davies’s eyebrows flickered upwards. He was actually reading the spreadsheet. He was following her finger. Kath felt a surge of adrenaline. This was working. “But I have a plan,” she pressed on, her confidence growing with every word. “I’ve already renegotiated with two of my main parts suppliers, getting a ten percent discount for prompt payment, which improves my variable cost margin. I’ve started a proper inventory system to reduce cash tied up in slow-moving stock, which you can see in my cash flow projection here.” She pointed to another page. “And I’ve identified that our most profitable work is diagnostics and MOT pre-checks, not general servicing. I’m creating a local marketing campaign targeting that specific, higher-margin work. I can start paying back the arrears at a rate of three hundred pounds a month, starting from next month. It’s all there.” She finished, breathless, her heart pounding. The ball was in his court.

Mr. Davies was silent for a long time. He leaned back in his chair, tapping a pen against Kath’s repayment proposal. He looked from the papers back to her, and for the first time, she felt he was actually seeing her, not just a case number. He saw the faint grease in her cuticles, the determined set of her jaw, the cheap blazer and the intelligent, worried eyes. He saw the contradiction, and in his line of work, he’d seen it before. The ones who came in shouting or crying were easy to deal with. The ones who came in with spreadsheets were a different species entirely. “You’ve put some work into this,” he said, his tone shifting from bored official to something approaching professional respect. “This cash flow projection… you’ve accounted for VAT and a five percent contingency for unexpected expenses. Most people forget that.”

"You have to," Kath replied simply. "A snapped timing belt on a customer's car, a compressor failure... that's my contingency gone for a month. It’s the reality of the business." He nodded slowly, a small, almost imperceptible gesture of acknowledgement. He looked at her repayment figure. "Three hundred a month. That's a thirty-six-month schedule, give or take. It's longer than we'd usually accept." Kath’s stomach tightened again, but she held his gaze. "It's what I can afford without bankrupting the business," she said, her voice firm. "If the garage goes under, you get nothing. This way, you get everything. And the city keeps a small, independent business and two local jobs. That’s got to be worth something, hasn't it?" She had just argued the socio-economic benefit of her own survival. She could almost hear Alistair murmur, "Nicely played, Kathleen."

Mr. Davies stared at her for another ten seconds, a silence that stretched into an eternity. Then, with a decisive movement, he stamped her proposal. The thud of the stamp was the most beautiful sound Kath had ever heard. “Alright, Miss Price,” he said, sliding the papers back into her folder. “On a provisional basis. You miss one payment, the deal is off, and we proceed. No second chances. The first payment is due on the first of next month. Is that clear?” “Crystal,” Kath said, a massive, shuddering wave of relief washing through her so powerfully she felt light-headed. She gathered her folder, her hands shaking slightly. "Thank you, Mr. Davies." "Don't thank me," he said, already turning back to his screen, his brief flicker of humanity extinguished. "Just pay your bills." Kath stood up and walked away from the desk, her feet barely touching the polished floor. She didn't look back. She walked out of the grey partition, through the waiting room of anxious faces, and pushed open the heavy glass doors into the bright, cold air of the city. The noise and the light hit her like a physical blow. She had done it. She had faced the beast, and she had won. Not with a spanner, but with a spreadsheet. She leaned against the rough brick wall of the building, taking a deep, ragged breath. Her hand went instinctively to her pocket, her fingers closing around the small, solid form of Professor Alistair Finch. She squeezed him gently. They had done it.She walked for ten minutes without any real destination, her feet carrying her away from the sterile monolith of the council offices and into the messy, living heart of the city. The sounds of traffic, the chatter of shoppers, the distant cry of a market trader – it all washed over her, a chaotic symphony of normal life that she suddenly felt a part of again. She found herself by the canal, where old warehouses of red brick, the same colour as her garage, stood converted into shiny flats with glass balconies. She sat on a cold, wrought-iron bench, the damp seeping slightly through her thin blazer, and finally let out the breath she felt she’d been holding for a month. It came out as a shaky, half-hysterical laugh.

She placed the folder carefully on the bench beside her and slipped her hand into her pocket. Her fingers closed around him, and she drew him out into the pale afternoon light. She held him in her palm, his plastic tweed jacket and sensible trousers a speck of academic calm against the backdrop of the grey, swirling water. “We did it, Alistair,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “You were right. The data was sound.” She looked at his impassive, painted face and felt a ridiculous, overwhelming wave of love and gratitude. He was her anchor, her secret weapon. He hadn’t just helped her understand spreadsheets; he had helped her find a part of herself she thought had died with her dad – the part that could fight back. A couple walking a dog gave her a curious glance as she sat talking to the toy, but she didn’t care. For the first time in years, she didn’t care what anyone else thought. She felt free.

When she got back to the garage, the familiar scent of petrol and metal polish felt less like the smell of a tomb and more like the smell of home. Of possibility. Liam was hunched over a tyre-fitting machine, wrestling with a stubborn wheel rim, his face a familiar mask of sullen concentration. In the past, Kath would have barked at him to use more leverage or just shoved him aside to do it herself. Today, she walked over and watched him for a moment. “Having trouble?” she asked, her tone even. He grunted an affirmation, not looking up. “Try a bit more paste on the bead and drop the pressure in short bursts,” she advised quietly. “Don't fight it, persuade it.” He shot her a surprised look, but did as she suggested. A moment later, the tyre seated itself with a satisfying pop. “Cheers,” he muttered, looking vaguely embarrassed.

Kath wiped a smear of grease from a toolbox with a rag. “I went to the council this morning,” she said, not looking at him directly. “About the bills.” Liam froze, sensing the gravity of the topic. “They’ve given us a chance,” Kath continued, finally meeting his eye. “They’ve agreed to a payment plan. It means we’re not getting shut down next month.” A flicker of relief, genuine and unguarded, crossed the teenager’s face. “But,” she added, her voice hardening with purpose, “it means the real work starts now. No more messing about, no more wasted time. I need this place to run like a Swiss watch, not a leaky engine. I need you to be on it, one hundred percent. Can you do that?” She was asking, not telling. Liam looked from her to the newly organised shelves, to the clean space on the office desk, and something in her new-found seriousness seemed to connect with him. He stood up a little straighter. “Yeah, Kath,” he said. “Yeah. I can do that.”

That night, Kath didn't just collapse onto the sofa with a mug of tea and a slice of toast. She went to the corner shop and bought a small piece of steak, a potato, and a bag of green beans. She cooked herself a proper meal, searing the steak until it was just right, and mashing the potato with a knob of butter. It felt ridiculously decadent. She laid the table with a placemat and her best knife and fork. And next to her plate, she set down Alistair, standing proudly on his coaster. As she ate, she talked to him, recounting the meeting with Mr. Davies in vivid detail, mimicking his weary voice, celebrating the moment the stamp came down. It wasn't lonely. It was a victory dinner for two. After she had washed up, she logged onto her laptop. She didn’t open the spreadsheet. Instead, she browsed eBay. After twenty minutes of searching, she found it: a miniature, brass-effect astrolabe on a tiny wooden stand, designed for a doll's house study. It was described as a ‘Gentleman’s Desk Accessory’. It was perfect. It was the sort of thing a man like Alistair would have. She clicked ‘Buy It Now’, her heart giving a little, happy skip.

The next morning, she arrived at the garage half an hour early, a new notebook tucked under her arm. On the first page, she wrote ‘MARKETING’ in the same determined block capitals she had used for her action plan. She began to sketch out a flyer. She chewed the end of her pen, thinking hard. Her dad had always relied on word-of-mouth, but that was a slow, passive way to get business. She needed to be proactive. She needed to target the right people. *Identify your key demographic and their needs,* she could almost hear Alistair advise. Her key demographic wasn't kids with souped-up Corsas; it was mums on the school run, pensioners who relied on their car for independence, local delivery drivers whose vans were their livelihood. They didn’t care about performance upgrades; they cared about reliability, honesty, and not being ripped off. She began to write, the words coming easily. "Price's Garage: Keeping Leeds on the Move for 40 Years. Worried about that strange noise? Is your MOT due? We offer clear, honest diagnostics and fair prices. No jargon, no hidden extras. Just good, old-fashioned service you can trust." It wasn't slick. It wasn't clever. But it was true. And she had a feeling, a gut instinct backed up by a month of intensive learning, that it would work. She looked up from her notebook, across the quiet garage floor, at the sleeping metal beasts waiting for her attention. The dread was gone. In its place was a quiet, thrilling hum of purpose. This was hers to save. And she was just getting started.The stack of flyers sat on the passenger seat of the tow truck, a solid, reassuring block of five hundred. The paper was glossy, thicker than she’d expected for the price, and the ink was a bold, no-nonsense black. She’d spent two hours at a small print shop near the market, tweaking the layout with a patient young man who hadn’t batted an eyelid when she’d asked for the font to be ‘less fancy, more trustworthy’. Holding the first one in her hands, still warm from the printer, had been a quiet thrill. It was a tangible object, a physical manifestation of her plan. It was more than a piece of advertising; it was a declaration of intent. Price’s Garage was under new management. Her management.

Distributing them was an exercise in mortifying self-promotion. The old Kath would have sooner dismantled a V8 engine blindfolded than walk into a bustling supermarket and ask to put a flyer on their community noticeboard. But the old Kath was being methodically dismantled and rebuilt, piece by piece. She channelled Alistair’s imagined academic detachment, treating it as a field study in local marketing channels. She pinned her flyers to the cork boards in the post office, the library, and the doctor’s surgery, placing them strategically next to ads for yoga classes and missing cats. She tucked them under the windscreen wipers of cars in the retail park, focusing on the sensible family estates and the slightly battered work vans, her target demographic. Each flyer placed was a small act of bravery, a quiet rebellion against the years of just waiting for the phone to ring.

Back at the garage, the atmosphere was undergoing a subtle but definite change. Liam, having survived the great gasket sort-out, seemed to have grudgingly accepted the new world order. The constant, low-level grumbling was replaced by a more focused silence. One afternoon, Kath saw him painstakingly creating a chart on the wall listing the different grades of engine oil and which car brands they were compatible with. He hadn’t been asked; he’d just done it. "So we don't have to keep looking it up on our phones," he’d explained, a defensive edge to his voice. Kath had felt a surge of pride that almost knocked her off balance. "That's a good idea, Liam," she’d said, her voice softer than she'd intended. "A real time-saver." She’d seen a faint blush rise on his neck. It was a breakthrough. She wasn't just managing the garage anymore; she was starting to lead a team, even if it was a team of two.

A small, padded envelope arrived at the flat one Friday evening. Kath opened it with an unusual sense of anticipation. Inside, nestled in bubble wrap, was the miniature astrolabe. It was exquisite, no bigger than her thumb, but perfectly formed from gleaming brass-effect metal, its interlocking rings designed to measure the stars. She set it on the desk next to Alistair, creating a tiny, dignified tableau. His coaster, his astrolabe. It was a study in miniature. That night, as she wrestled with the principles of SWOT analysis – Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats – their session felt different. More official. She listed the garage’s attributes aloud for her silent professor, now equipped with his own academic instrument. "Strength: my diagnostic skill. Weakness: the building's a wreck. Opportunity: all the other garages round here charge a fortune. Threat: the council, Mr. Davies, and this massive bill." Laying it all out for him, making it neat and ordered, made the threats seem less like monsters under the bed and more like tactical problems on a map.

It was a drizzly Tuesday morning, nearly a week after the flyer drop, when the bell above the office door chimed. A woman in her forties, with a worried expression and a raincoat dripping onto the floor, stood clutching one of Kath's flyers as if it were a winning lottery ticket. “Hello?” she said, her voice hesitant. “Are you… Price’s Garage?” Liam was out on a recovery, so Kath wiped her hands and came out from behind the office counter. “I am. I’m Kath Price. What can I do for you?” The woman, who introduced herself as Sarah, unfolded the flyer. “I found this in the library. It said ‘honest diagnostics’. I hope that’s true.” She explained that her car was making a terrible grinding noise and that another garage had quoted her nearly eight hundred pounds to replace the entire clutch and flywheel, a sum she simply couldn’t afford.

Kath felt a familiar mix of professional curiosity and a new, sharp sense of opportunity. This was her test. This was the moment her flyer’s promise would either be proven true or false. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” she said, her voice calm and reassuring. “A grinding noise could be a lot of things. Let me put it on the ramp and have a proper look. I won’t do any work, I’ll just find out what the problem is. Then I’ll come and talk to you, show you what I’ve found, and we can decide what to do. No charge for having a look.” The relief that washed over Sarah’s face was immense. That alone felt like a small victory. The old way would have been a grunt and a sucking of teeth, an implied promise of expense. This new way, Alistair's way, was about clarity and building trust.

With the car on the ramp, Kath’s hands took over, moving with the innate, practiced confidence of a surgeon. The grinding was obvious as soon as the wheel was spinning. It wasn’t the deep, terminal groan of a failing clutch. It was higher, more metallic. Her fingers, trained by years of touch and instinct, traced the problem in minutes. A small stone had become trapped between the brake disc and the thin metal dust shield behind it. It was a five-minute fix. A simple case of prizing the shield back a fraction and letting the stone fall out. The other garage hadn’t even bothered to look; they’d just heard a noise from that area and quoted for the most expensive possible job. A wave of cold fury washed over Kath – at their dishonesty, at the casual way they were prepared to fleece this worried woman.

She called Sarah over to the ramp, something her dad would never have done. She used the torch on her phone to show her the gleaming brake disc, the thin metal shield, and the small, offending piece of grit now lying on the garage floor. “This was your eight-hundred-pound problem,” Kath explained, her voice devoid of triumph, just stating a fact. “A piece of gravel. The other garage either didn't look properly, or they were trying to pull a fast one. There’s nothing wrong with your clutch at all.” She watched the woman’s face cycle through confusion, to dawning comprehension, to pure, unadulterated gratitude. "So... what do I owe you?" Sarah asked, her voice trembling slightly. Kath thought for a second. The old ledger book mentality would be to do it for nothing, a handshake and a "don't worry about it". But her new spreadsheet brain knew better. Her time was a commodity. "Let's call it twenty quid," she said. "For a quarter-hour of diagnostic labour."

Sarah paid with a crisp twenty-pound note, her hands still shaking. “Thank you,” she said, her eyes shining with tears of relief. “Thank you so much. I’ll be telling everyone I know about this place.” As she drove her blessedly silent car out of the garage, Kath stood watching, the twenty-pound note warm in her hand. It wasn’t the money. It was the principle. It was the proof. Her plan, born from desperation and tutored by a plastic man, was working. That evening, as she locked the big metal shutters, the familiar groan of the mechanism sounded less like a complaint and more like a sigh of relief. The garage was still a drafty brick tomb, but she had opened a window and let in a sliver of light. She was tired, a deep, bone-weary exhaustion, but it was the satisfying ache of a job well done, of a battle well-fought. In her pocket, the small, hard outline of Dr. Alistair Finch was a constant, comforting presence. She was building a business, not just fixing cars. And it felt like the most natural thing in the world.That single twenty-pound note became a talisman. Kath pinned it to the corkboard in the office, right over a list of suppliers’ phone numbers. It sat there, a crisp, blue rectangle of proof. When Liam came back, he stared at it. “What’s that for?” he asked, jerking his chin towards it. “That,” Kath said, leaning back in the creaking office chair and taking a sip of tea, “is the price of honesty. It’s also the price of a five-minute job that another garage wanted to charge eight hundred quid for.” She explained the whole story: the grinding noise, the trapped stone, the terrified customer. Liam listened, his usual mask of indifference cracking to reveal genuine disbelief, then a flicker of disgust for the other garage. “That’s out of order,” he mumbled. “Yeah, it is,” Kath agreed. “But it’s also our biggest opportunity. We’re not just going to be cheaper. We’re going to be the place that doesn’t rip you off. That’s the brand. That’s what we’re selling.” Brand. The word felt strange and foreign on her tongue, but also right. She was speaking the language of her night class, but it was rooted in the gritty reality of her own floor. The twenty pounds wasn't just profit; it was a mission statement.

Sarah, true to her word, was a magnificent town crier. The phone, which had previously punctuated the garage’s silence with the funereal regularity of a dripping tap, began to ring with a new urgency. The calls all started in a similar way. “Hello, is that Price’s? My friend Sarah recommended you…” or “A lady at the school gates said you were very good…” They were voices laced with hope and skepticism, people who had been burned before. Kath started a proper appointment diary, a smart, hardback book she bought from a stationer’s. The pages, once starkly white, began to fill with names and registration numbers. The work was different, too. It was less about patching up MOT failures on their last legs and more about investigating specific, anxiety-inducing problems. It was diagnostics, problem-solving, and consultation. It required her brain as much as her hands, and she found she was energised by it, the challenge sharpening her focus and pushing the exhaustion into the background.

The real test of her new reputation arrived in the form of a gleaming, dark grey Audi A4 that whispered onto the forecourt with the quiet arrogance of expensive German engineering. The man who climbed out wore a coat that probably cost more than Kath earned in a week. He looked around the shabby garage with an expression of profound doubt, as if he’d taken a wrong turn and ended up in a different century. “I was told you might be able to help,” he said, his tone suggesting he was already regretting the decision. “The main dealer wants to replace the entire ECU. They say there’s a cascade failure in the sensor network. The quote is… significant.” He handed her a print-out that made her eyes water. The figure was more than the arrears she had just negotiated to pay back. “And you heard I was cheap?” Kath asked, her chin lifting slightly. The man gave a thin, apologetic smile. “I heard you were honest,” he corrected her. “A colleague of my wife’s. A woman named Sarah.” Kath felt a jolt of vindication. Her network was spreading into territories she’d never imagined. “Right,” she said, her voice all business. “Leave it with me. I’ll run my own diagnostics. I’ll call you before I so much as touch a spanner.”

This was a different beast. The Audi’s engine bay was a symphony of pristine plastic covers and complex wiring looms, a world away from the greasy, accessible heart of a Ford Escort. This was a battle of wits, not brute force. She wheeled over her ageing diagnostic machine, its screen a relic from a bygone era, and plugged it into the car’s port. It spat out a dizzying array of fault codes, the same ‘cascade failure’ the main dealer had seen. The easy answer was to agree with them. But that wasn’t the deal. With Alistair perched on a clean workbench nearby, a silent observer in his tweed, she began to talk the problem through. “Okay, Alistair. A cascade failure is nonsense. It’s a symptom, not a cause. One of these sensors is lying, and it’s making all the other ones panic. The question is, which one is the liar?” She spent the next three hours with a multimeter and a laptop open on a technical forum, painstakingly tracing wires, testing voltages, and cross-referencing schematics. It was methodical, frustrating work, a digital archaeology expedition. And then she found it. A single wire, leading to the camshaft position sensor, had rubbed through its insulation on a metal bracket, hidden deep in the guts of the loom. When the engine was warm, it would expand just enough to short-circuit against the chassis, sending gibberish to the ECU and triggering the electronic chaos.

She didn't just fix it. She photographed the frayed wire with her phone, then repaired it with a new piece of wire and heat-shrink tubing, securing the loom away from the sharp bracket that had caused the problem in the first place. When the owner returned, she walked him through the pictures, explaining the logic of her diagnosis. “The dealer’s solution was to replace the brain,” she said. “My solution was to find out why the brain was getting bad information. Your bill is for three-and-a-half hours of labour and fifty pence worth of wire.” The man, whose name was Mark, was utterly silent. He stared from the photo on her phone to her oil-stained fingers, a look of astonishment on his face. He paid the bill without a word, but as he was leaving, he paused. “I sit on the board of a company that runs a fleet of fifty delivery vans in the city,” he said. “Our current service contract is up for renewal next month. I’d like you to submit a tender.” He handed her a business card. “Send your proposal directly to me.”

Kath stood frozen in the middle of the garage floor long after the Audi had purred away, clutching the crisp, expensive business card. A tender. A fleet. This was a different league. The scale of it was terrifying and exhilarating. The victory, however, highlighted a critical weakness. Her old diagnostic machine had nearly failed her; it was too slow, its software too basic for this level of work. Relying on it for a fifty-van fleet would be professional suicide. That night, she spread a dozen brochures for new diagnostic systems across her kitchen table. The prices were astronomical, a wall of numbers that made her stomach clench. It was a classic 'scarcity' problem. She had limitless wants – the desire for a modern, efficient garage – but severely limited resources. She laid out her neatly printed-out P&L statement and her cash flow projection, the tools of her new language. She ran the numbers, calculating the potential return on investment against the crippling upfront cost. The old Kath would have thrown the brochures in the bin. The new Kath, with Dr. Finch standing sentinel beside his tiny astrolabe, saw it not as an impossible expense, but as a capital investment crucial for growth.

She picked up the phone, her heart beating a steady, determined rhythm. Her finger hovered over the number for the sales department. Then she stopped, and scrolled down the supplier’s website until she found a different number, one for ‘Business & Fleet Solutions’. She took a deep breath. "Hello," she said, when a voice answered. "My name is Kathleen Price, from Price's Garage. I'm not looking to purchase a unit today. I'm interested in discussing your commercial leasing options and maintenance packages. I'm preparing a tender for a new fleet contract, and I need to factor in the monthly cost of a reliable, fully supported diagnostic partner." She listened to the surprised but interested response from the other end of the line, and a slow smile spread across her face. She was no longer just asking to fix things. She was building a partnership. She was speaking their language. And in the quiet of her kitchen, it felt like the most powerful language in the world.The business card sat on the desk next to Alistair’s astrolabe, a stark white rectangle of terrifying potential. ‘Mark Henderson, Operations Director’. For two days, Kath just looked at it, the embossed lettering seeming to mock the greasy reality of her garage. A tender. It was a word from her night class, a concept that belonged in the world of shiny suits and boardrooms, not a drafty brick building in Holbeck. The chasm between her world and his seemed too vast to cross. But every time the fear threatened to paralyse her, she would look at the twenty-pound note pinned to the wall, and the memory of Mark Henderson’s astonished face would steady her. Honesty. That was the bridge.

The evenings at her kitchen table transformed again. The archaeology of her dad’s ledgers was replaced by a formidable architectural project: building the tender document. She downloaded templates, read guidance articles, and talked it all through with Alistair, who stood, as ever, in his designated corner. “Right, Professor,” she’d begin, propping a laptop open next to him. “Pricing strategy. They run a fleet of fifty Ford Transits. That means bulk buying on filters, oil, brake pads. We can get our variable costs right down. But the real value isn’t in the parts, it’s in the uptime. Keeping those vans on the road.” She paced her small kitchen, gesturing as if addressing a board meeting. “So we don’t sell them a cheap service. We sell them a ‘Fleet Reliability Partnership’. We offer guaranteed 24-hour turnaround on standard jobs. We offer proactive maintenance scheduling based on their mileage data. We’re not just spanner-monkeys, we’re part of their logistics chain.” The words, born of her coursework but forged in her own mind, felt powerful and true. She was building a case, not just a quote.

A week later, a large, heavy box arrived. The new diagnostic tablet. The leasing agreement, with its daunting monthly figure, was already tucked away in her ‘ACTION’ folder, a ticking financial time bomb. She and Liam carried the box into the office and opened it with a reverence usually reserved for holy relics. Inside, nestled in futuristic moulded foam, was a sleek, ruggedised tablet with a large, bright screen. It looked like something from a science fiction film. Liam reached out a tentative hand and touched the smooth gorilla glass. “Whoa,” he breathed. “It’s… mint.” Kath felt a lurch of pure terror mixed with elation. This was the most expensive thing in the garage, aside from the tow truck. It was a physical commitment, a point of no return. “Yeah,” she said, her voice tight. “And we’ve got to make it earn its keep, starting now.”

This was the moment she decided to trust Liam. Not just with a task, but with a piece of the future. She printed out the technical specifications for the fleet’s Ford Transit model. “Liam,” she said, laying the papers on the clean workbench. “This is your project. I need a full cost-and-time breakdown for a major service on one of these vans. I want parts costs from three different suppliers, I want you to time yourself doing the key jobs on old man Hemlock’s Transit when it comes in tomorrow, and I want a list of every consumable, right down to the last squirt of grease. I need it accurate to the penny and the minute. It’s for the tender.” She expected a grumble, a protest. Instead, he picked up the papers and looked at them with a new seriousness in his eyes. The trust she was showing him was a heavier responsibility than any toolbox. He nodded, a sharp, focused gesture. “Right,” he said. “I’m on it.”

For the next few nights, Kath wrote. She poured everything she had into the document. She created a professional-looking cover page with the garage’s name in a clean, bold font. She wrote a short, powerful history of the business, framing her dad not as a poor bookkeeper, but as an artisan mechanic who built a forty-year reputation for skill. Then she introduced the ‘New Management’ section, detailing her own qualifications – including a scanned certificate from her nearly-completed night course – and her philosophy of ‘Transparent Diagnostics’. She created a case study titled ‘The Eight-Hundred-Pound Stone’, telling Sarah’s story without names but with unflinching detail. She included Liam’s meticulously researched cost breakdown, presented in a neat table. She photographed the new diagnostic tablet and included the picture under the heading ‘Investment in Technology’. The final document was twenty pages long. It was the story of her life, her business, and her ambition, all translated into the cool, clear language of commerce.

The night before the submission deadline, she printed a final copy. The pages felt heavy and important in her hands. Exhaustion washed over her, so profound it was almost dizzying. She had done everything she could. She had wrestled the chaotic, greasy soul of her father’s legacy into this neat, logical, corporate document. And she had never felt more like an impostor. Who was she to be submitting this? A girl who still had to scrub her fingernails with a wire brush to get them clean. A woman who, just a few short months ago, was falling in love with a plastic doll out of sheer desperation. Her hand trembled as she reached for Alistair. She didn't put him on his coaster. She just held him, his small, solid form a comfort in her palm. She closed her eyes, pressing the cool plastic of his head against her cheek. “What if they laugh at me, Alistair?” she whispered into the quiet of the flat. “What if it’s all just… rubbish? What if I win, and I can’t do it?” There was no answer, only the hum of the fridge. But in her mind, his voice was clearer than ever. *The methodology is sound. The evidence is presented. You have mitigated for risk. You are not an impostor, Kathleen. You are the Managing Director.* She took a long, shaky breath and opened her eyes. She felt… calm. He was right. She had done the work.

The next morning, she didn’t put the tender in an envelope. She took it back to the print shop and had the twenty pages professionally bound with a clear cover and a smart black spine. It cost her twelve pounds she could barely spare, but it was a statement. Then, wearing her best jeans and the blazer that no longer felt like a costume, she drove the tow truck – her biggest, most visible asset – into the city centre. She parked in a loading bay right outside Mark Henderson’s gleaming office building, drawing more than a few curious stares. She walked into the plush, silent reception, the bound document held firmly in her hand. “I have a delivery for Mr. Mark Henderson,” she said to the receptionist, her voice steady. The woman looked from Kath’s work-worn hands to the tow truck visible through the plate-glass window, a flicker of confusion on her face. Kath placed the tender on the polished marble counter. The thud it made was solid, final, and deeply satisfying. “My name is Kathleen Price,” she said. “He’s expecting it.” As she walked out, the weight of the document gone from her hands, she felt terrifyingly light. There was nothing left to do now but work, and wait.The drive back to the garage was an exercise in sensory whiplash. The tow truck, which had felt like a statement of intent outside the gleaming corporate headquarters, now felt like a lumbering, greasy dinosaur amidst the city traffic. The plush silence of Mark Henderson’s reception lobby was replaced by the familiar roar of the diesel engine and the rattling of the winch chain. Back on her own turf, the smell of old oil and damp brickwork rushed to meet her, a scent she now associated with both despair and burgeoning hope. She parked the truck in its usual spot, killed the engine, and the ensuing silence was heavy with anticlimax. The grand, decisive act was over. Now, there was only the terrible, echoing quiet of the wait.

The first few days were a blur of frantic activity. Kath threw herself at every job with a kind of manic energy, as if she could physically out-work the anxiety that hummed just beneath her skin. Every time the office phone rang, her heart would slam against her ribs, and she would snatch it up with a breathless "Price’s Garage," only to find it was a cold caller trying to sell her cheap insurance or a customer asking for a quote on brake pads. Each call was a tiny, sharp disappointment. She found herself obsessively checking her emails on her laptop, her finger hovering over the ‘refresh’ button as if she could will a message from Mark Henderson into existence. Liam watched her, his expression unreadable, but he worked with a new, quiet diligence, organising the new inventory of filters and plugs with meticulous care. The unspoken question of the tender hung in the air between them, a shared, high-stakes secret that bound them together more tightly than any employment contract.

A week bled into ten days. The manic energy began to curdle into a corrosive dread. The silence from Mark Henderson’s office was no longer a neutral space of possibility, but a damning verdict. Kath started to see her beautifully bound tender not as a professional proposal, but as a deeply embarrassing piece of overreach. She imagined a boardroom of laughing men in expensive suits, passing around her heartfelt ‘case study’ of the eight-hundred-pound stone as an amusing piece of provincial folly. The doubt was a physical presence, a cold weight in her gut that made the stewed tea taste bitter and the honest work feel pointless. One night, she sat at her kitchen table, the laptop closed, the textbooks ignored, and just stared at Dr. Finch. "I was an idiot, wasn't I?" she whispered to him, her voice rough with unshed tears. "Thinking I could play in their league. Me. With my dad's old spanners and a plastic man for a business advisor." The little figure offered no absolution, his plastic face a mask of frustrating neutrality. For the first time, his silence felt less like wisdom and more like a void, reflecting her own spiralling emptiness.

The crisis, when it came, was cruelly ironic. It was a Tuesday morning, grey and spitting with rain, when a call came in for a breakdown on the M621. A delivery van, stranded on the hard shoulder. It was their bread-and-butter work. Kath drove out, the wipers smearing the grime on the windscreen, her mind a million miles away, still replaying her imagined humiliation at the hands of Mark Henderson. She hitched up the van, her movements automatic, and began the slow, careful journey back to the garage. It was on the exit slip-road that it happened. A sudden, sickening lurch, followed by a metallic screeching from the tow truck’s own engine that was so violent it vibrated through the floor of the cab. A plume of acrid, blue-white smoke billowed from under the bonnet. She knew that sound. It was the sound of catastrophic failure. It was the sound of a business dying. With a heart full of ice, she wrestled the truck, with its attached casualty, into a lay-by, her own rescuer now a wreck.

Somehow, she got them both back. It took two hours, a frantic call to a rival firm she loathed, and a humiliating payment in cash to have her own tow truck ignominiously hauled onto her forecourt. It sat there, crippled and smoking faintly, a monument to her failing fortunes. The driver of the delivery van was surprisingly understanding, but his sympathy only sharpened her shame. The one piece of equipment that screamed ‘Price’s Garage’ to the world, her mobile advertisement, her lifeline to stranded motorists, was dead. She and Liam stood over the open bonnet, the scale of the disaster laid bare. The engine block was slick with fresh oil, not the usual grime. “It’s thrown a rod,” Liam said, his voice barely a whisper. “Punched a hole clean through the side.” Kath didn’t need to look. She could smell it. The scent of hot, burnt metal and financial ruin. She closed her eyes, the single twenty-pound note pinned to her office wall flashing in her mind. It seemed like a joke now. What was twenty pounds against the ten thousand a new engine would cost?

She walked into the office and slumped into her chair, the springs groaning in protest. The room, which had become her sanctuary and command centre, now felt like a cage. This was it. This was the blow she couldn't parry. The payment to the council was due next week. The first leasing instalment for the diagnostic tablet was on the same day. Without the tow truck, a huge chunk of her income was gone. The tender, the great hope for the future, was irrelevant. There would be no future. The familiar cold knot of despair tightened in her stomach, fiercer than ever before. She wanted to sweep everything from her desk, to scream, to kick the filing cabinet her dad had left her. But her eyes fell on the corner of the desk, on the tiny, tweed-clad figure of Dr. Alistair Finch and his gleaming astrolabe. It was so absurd, so utterly ridiculous in the face of this overwhelming disaster. And yet. The habit was too ingrained. She pulled a clean sheet of paper from the printer, her hand shaking. With a deep, shuddering breath, she picked up a pen. At the top of the page, she wrote, ‘ASSET FAILURE: RECOVERY STRATEGY’. She drew a line down the middle. On one side, she wrote ‘COSTS’ and on the other, ‘OPTIONS’. It was a desperate, almost pathetic act of defiance against the tidal wave of panic threatening to drown her.

She was still staring at the sheet an hour later, the ‘COSTS’ column a terrifying list of four-figure sums and the ‘OPTIONS’ column almost insultingly blank, when the phone rang. Its shrill br-ring cut through the funereal quiet of the garage like a surgeon’s scalpel. Her first instinct was to ignore it. What was the point? But old habits died hard. She picked up the receiver, her voice flat, deadened by defeat. “Price’s Garage.” There was a brief pause, then a bright, clear voice, the kind of voice that had never known the scent of engine oil, came down the line. “Hello, could I speak to Kathleen Price, please? My name is Jessica. I’m calling from Mark Henderson’s office.” Time seemed to slow down. The drip of water from a leaking gutter outside, the distant buzz of a fluorescent light, the frantic hammering of her own heart – it all became hyper-distinct. This was the call. The verdict. It had arrived not in her moment of triumph, but here, in the depths of her absolute lowest point. The universe, it seemed, had a twisted sense of humour.“This is Kathleen Price,” she managed to say, her voice sounding distant and thin, as if it were coming from the other side of the garage. The name felt like a label for someone else, for the woman who wrote twenty-page proposals, not the woman sitting in a failing office staring at a dead truck. Her mind raced, preparing for the gentle, corporate rejection. *‘While your proposal was very thorough… we’ve decided to go in a different direction… we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours…’* She braced herself for the final, polite nail in her coffin.

“Great!” Jessica’s voice was impossibly bright, a splash of vibrant colour in Kath’s monochrome world of despair. “Mr. Henderson has reviewed your tender document, and he was very impressed. He said it was one of the most well-thought-out proposals he’s seen from a smaller enterprise.” A wave of dizziness washed over Kath. She gripped the edge of the desk, her knuckles white. This wasn't the rejection script. This was something else, something worse. It was a phantom limb, a ghost of a hope she thought had already died. “He was particularly interested in your ‘Fleet Reliability Partnership’ model and the case study you included. It demonstrated a clear understanding of downtime as the primary cost driver.”

Kath tried to form a word, but her throat was a knot of dust and disbelief. She could hear Liam moving around outside, the soft scrape of a broom on the concrete floor, a funereal tidying of their shared disaster zone. The sound was a world away from the clean, confident language of ‘cost drivers’ and ‘partnership models’ being piped into her ear. “Mr. Henderson would like to invite you to a final meeting to discuss the implementation phase and finalise the terms of the contract,” Jessica continued, oblivious to the silence on the other end of the line. “He’s available this Friday at 11 a.m. Would that be suitable for you?”

Friday. Two days away. The day the council payment was due. The day she was supposed to find a mythical sum of money to keep the lights on, and now she was being summoned to a palace to discuss a kingdom she couldn't possibly rule. The sheer, savage absurdity of it was so immense it almost made her laugh. It was a hysterical, ragged sound caught in her throat. She looked through the glass panel of her office, her gaze falling on the broken tow truck. Its powerful front end, designed to haul other people’s failures, was now inert and useless, a monument to her own. How could she go to that meeting? How could she sit opposite Mark Henderson and talk about guaranteeing the uptime of fifty vans when her own key asset was a ten-tonne paperweight?

“Miss Price? Are you still there?” Jessica’s cheerful voice sliced through her paralysis. This was the moment. The point where she could confess. *‘I’m sorry, there’s been a mistake. My business is falling apart. My truck is dead. I can’t do it.’* The words formed in her mind, a simple, honest admission of defeat. It would be a relief to say them. But then, another image pushed its way forward: the sneering face of Mr. Davies at the council, the imagined laughter in the boardroom, the quiet disappointment she always felt when she looked at her dad’s empty chair. The spark of defiance that had been all but extinguished flickered, weakly at first, then with a surge of pure, stubborn rage. She would not give them the satisfaction. “Yes,” she said, and the voice was hers again, rough and raw but solid. “Yes, Friday at eleven is perfect. I’ll be there.”

After the call, a profound silence descended on the small office. Kath slowly placed the receiver back in its cradle. The news didn’t feel like a victory. It felt like a trap. It was a lifeline thrown to a drowning woman who now had to learn to swim before it pulled her under. She looked down at the piece of paper on her desk. ‘ASSET FAILURE: RECOVERY STRATEGY’. The blank ‘OPTIONS’ column seemed to mock her. She picked up the pen. Her hand was shaking, but she wrote a single new entry under the heading: ‘1. Secure Fleet Contract.’ It looked insane. It was insane. It was the only move she had left.

Liam appeared at the office door, his face smudged with grease and worry. He held a spanner in his hand like a useless sceptre. “Anything?” he asked, his eyes gesturing towards the phone. He meant had she found a cheap engine, a miracle cure. Kath took a deep breath, the air tasting of oil and desperation. “That was Mark Henderson’s office,” she said, her voice flat. Liam’s face fell, assuming the worst. “Oh. Right.” He prepared to turn away, to go back to the pointless sweeping. “They want a final meeting on Friday to discuss the contract,” Kath added, watching him. He froze, his back still to her. He turned around slowly, his expression a mask of utter confusion. “The fleet contract?” he said, as if he’d misheard. “But… the truck…”

“I know,” Kath said, her gaze unwavering. “But they don’t.” She stood up, a new, terrible energy coursing through her. The despair was still there, a cold, hard stone in her stomach, but now it was surrounded by a frantic, jagged sense of purpose. “We have two days, Liam. Two days to figure out how we run a fifty-van fleet operation from a garage with a broken tow truck and no money.” Liam just stared at her, the spanner hanging limply from his hand. He looked from her wild, determined eyes to the dead truck outside, then back again. The sheer impossibility of it was written all over his face. But then, a different expression dawned. It wasn't hope, not yet. It was a kind of awe, a grudging respect for the sheer, bloody-minded audacity of his boss. “Okay,” he said, his voice quiet. “So what’s the plan?”The plan began not with a stroke of genius, but with a screech of marker pen on a dirty whiteboard. Kath dragged the board, usually covered in scribbled part numbers and greasy fingerprints, into the centre of the office floor. Liam followed her, a bewildered disciple trailing a mad prophet. Kath uncapped a black marker with a decisive flick of her wrist and drew a thick line down the middle of the board. At the top of one column, she wrote ‘CRITICAL FAILURE’, and on the other, ‘SOLE OPPORTUNITY’. Under the first heading, she wrote in stark, angry capitals: ‘TOW TRUCK ENGINE – KAPUT’. Then she underlined it. Twice. Under the second, she wrote: ‘HENDERSON FLEET CONTRACT’.

“Right,” she said, turning to Liam, her eyes burning with a terrifying, feverish intensity. “The old way of thinking is that this,” she jabbed her pen at the dead truck, “stops us from getting that.” She jabbed it at the other column. “The old way is we tell them sorry, we can’t do it, and then we shut the doors in a month. But that’s my dad’s way of thinking. That’s feeling the problem. We’re not going to feel it. We’re going to analyse it.” She took a step back, looking at the board as if it were a complex schematic. “The truck is a failed asset. We can’t fix it. We don’t have the capital. So, for the purpose of the next forty-eight hours, the truck no longer exists. It’s off the table. It’s a sunk cost. We have to design a business that can function without it.”

Liam, who had been watching her as if she’d finally and completely lost her mind, spoke for the first time. The question was logical, simple, and utterly deflating. “But… what about breakdowns? The whole reason half our customers use us is because we can go and get them. It’s a recovery service, Kath.” He was right. It was the gaping, fatal hole in her grand, mad theory. For a second, Kath’s shoulders slumped. The sheer, crushing weight of reality pressed down on her. Then the anger returned, the same stubborn fury that had made her accept the meeting in the first place. “No,” she said, turning back to the board. “It’s a service we provide. It doesn’t mean we have to be the ones who provide it.” She wrote a new heading: ‘OUTSOURCING’.

“Who to?” Liam scoffed, the cynicism returning to his voice. “Davey’s Recovery? He’d laugh his head off. He hates us. He’s been trying to buy Dad’s patch for years.” The name hung in the air, sour and unpleasant. Davey’s was the bigger, slicker, more expensive outfit from the other side of town. Kath had a history of vicious arguments with their drivers over who got to a stranded car first. Her dad had despised Davey with a quiet, burning passion. To call him for help felt like a profound betrayal. But as Kath looked at the name on the board, she didn’t see a rival. She saw a business term. She saw a solution. “He’s a service provider, Liam. And we’d be a client. He doesn’t have to like us, he just has to like our money. If we get the Henderson contract, we’ll be putting more recovery work his way in a month than he gets in six. We don’t ask for a favour. We offer him a subcontracting deal.”

Swallowing a lump of pride that felt the size of a flywheel, Kath walked over to the desk, picked up the phone, and dialled the number for Davey’s Recovery from memory. Her hand was steady. Her heart was a frantic drum. Liam watched, wide-eyed. A gruff, familiar voice answered. “Davey.” Kath straightened her back, her voice dropping into the cool, professional tone she had rehearsed in her head. “Davey, it’s Kathleen Price at Price’s Garage. I’m calling with a business proposal. I’m finalising a major fleet maintenance contract and I’ll need a reliable recovery partner. I’m looking for a fixed-rate schedule for city-wide recovery and home-start assistance. I can guarantee a minimum volume of jobs per month. Are you interested in tendering for the work?” There was a long, stunned silence on the other end of the line. Kath could almost hear the gears turning in Davey’s head, the suspicion warring with the naked avarice. Finally, he spoke, his voice laced with grudging curiosity. “Aye,” he said slowly. “I might be. Send me the details.” Kath ended the call, her whole body trembling with adrenaline. She hadn’t solved the problem, but she had walled it off. She had created a firewall of pure, unadulterated bluff.

With the recovery issue now relegated to a tense but manageable negotiation, Kath’s entire focus shifted to Friday’s meeting. The nature of her preparation changed. It was no longer about proving she could do the job, but about constructing a narrative so compelling that Mark Henderson would never even think to ask about the tow truck. She and Liam spent the next day turning the garage into a stage. They cleared away all the old, broken engine parts that usually littered the corners. They painted a fresh, clean rectangle on the floor to designate a ‘Priority Fleet Vehicle Bay’. Liam, getting into the spirit of the deception, used the new diagnostic tablet to run a full simulation on his own battered hatchback, printing out a professional-looking report detailing its imaginary faults. They were building a theatre of competence.

The night before the meeting was the longest of Kath’s life. Sleep was an impossible dream. She sat at her kitchen table, the bound tender document in front of her, the small, silent figure of Alistair Finch beside it. She wasn’t reading or writing. She was role-playing. She was Mark Henderson, asking the hard questions. “What’s your procedure for an out-of-hours emergency?” “How do you prioritise fleet vehicles over your regular walk-in customers?” “What guarantees can you give me on parts availability?” For every question she devised, she formulated a calm, logical answer, referencing the processes she and Liam had spent the day inventing. The lie was becoming a plan. The deception was solidifying into a new operational reality. She wasn't just faking it; she was architecting the business she needed to become, in real time. She looked at Alistair, at his tiny, scholarly face. *It is not a deception, Kathleen,* she imagined him saying, his calm voice a balm on her frayed nerves. *It is a forward-looking statement of operational capability. You are selling the future, not the present.* And in the quiet of her Leeds flat, surrounded by the ghosts of her past and the terrifying possibilities of her future, that was enough. She was ready.Friday morning dawned cold and brutally clear. The sky was a pale, washed-out blue, offering no clouds for Kath to hide in. She stood in front of the mirror in her small bedroom, adjusting the shoulders of her blazer. It no longer felt like a costume or armour; it felt like a uniform for a soldier about to be sent on a suicide mission. Her hands were as clean as she could get them, the skin around her nails red and raw from the scrubbing. In the reflection, she looked pale, her eyes large and dark with lack of sleep, but her expression was one of grim, unyielding resolve. She carefully placed Dr. Alistair Finch into the blazer’s inner pocket. His small, solid weight against her ribs was a final, secret ritual, a grounding touch before she stepped into the void.

She couldn’t bear the thought of taking the bus, of being jostled by the mundane realities of other people’s lives. Instead, she called a taxi, a catastrophic expense that made her stomach clench with guilt. As the clean, anonymous car moved through the familiar Leeds streets, she felt a profound sense of dislocation. She was a ghost in her own city, gliding through a world that had no idea of the high-wire act she was about to perform. The taxi pulled up outside the gleaming glass-and-steel façade of Henderson’s building. She paid the driver with a carefully folded note from her dwindling cash reserves, got out, and took a deep breath of the cold city air. This was it. The theatre was about to open.

The receptionist offered a polite, professional smile. “Mr. Henderson is expecting you, Miss Price. Top floor, the boardroom at the end of the corridor.” The elevator ride was a silent, terrifying ascent into another world. The doors opened onto a hushed, carpeted expanse that smelled of money and filtered air. Her boots, her sturdiest, most presentable pair, made no sound as she walked towards the imposing double doors at the end of the hall. She knocked once, a sharp rap of her knuckles, and a voice from within called, “Come in.” She pushed the door open and stepped inside, her heart a frantic, trapped bird in her chest.

The boardroom was even more intimidating than she had imagined. A vast slab of dark, polished wood dominated the centre of the room, surrounded by a dozen high-backed leather chairs. One entire wall was a sheet of glass, offering a panoramic, god-like view of the city sprawling below. Mark Henderson stood to greet her, his smile as crisp as his shirt. He was not alone. Beside him sat an older man with thin, silver hair and a face that looked as though it had been carved from granite. His eyes, small and sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses, immediately began to appraise Kath, performing a silent, cold calculation. “Kathleen, good to see you again,” Mark said warmly. “This is our Finance Director, Mr. Collier. He had a few questions after reviewing your excellent proposal.”

Kath shook both their hands, her grip firm and dry. The die was cast. She sat opposite them, placing her notebook and pen on the table, a small island of her own organised reality in their vast, polished ocean. Mark began, his tone affable but his words pointed. “Mr. Collier and I were both very impressed, Kathleen. But your proposal makes some bold promises. ‘Guaranteed uptime’ is a powerful phrase. Let’s start there. One of my vans suffers a complete non-start in a customer’s car park in Seacroft at 8 p.m. on a Wednesday. Talk me through your response protocol, step by step.” This was the first test, the question that went straight to the heart of her deception.

She met his gaze, her mind a calm, clear space where she had rehearsed this a dozen times. “Of course. The driver would call our dedicated fleet hotline, which would be manned twenty-four hours a day. The call handler logs the issue and location, and immediately dispatches a response unit from our strategic recovery partner.” She paused, letting the corporate jargon settle in the air. “We have an SLA – a service level agreement – in place that guarantees a roadside technician on-scene within sixty minutes inside the city ring road. If the vehicle can be repaired at the roadside, it is. If not, it’s recovered and brought directly to our workshop, where it is designated a priority job for a next-morning diagnosis.” She didn’t mention Davey by name. She didn’t have to. She was selling a system, not a friendship.

Mr. Collier, the finance director, leaned forward, his steepled fingers resting on her tender document. His voice was like dry gravel. “This ‘strategic partner’ and ‘dedicated hotline’… it sounds expensive, Miss Price. Your quoted price per service is competitive, but not the cheapest we received. How are you absorbing these premium overheads?” It was a pincer movement. Mark tested the operation, Collier tested the finances. Kath turned to address him directly, seeing not an enemy, but a problem to be solved with logic. “You’re right, Mr. Collier, it’s not a cheap model. But the initial quotes you received are based on a reactive service model. They fix things when they break. My model is about proactive maintenance to prevent failure in the first place. The premium for the recovery service is offset by the reduced frequency of its use. My pricing includes regular diagnostic checks using state-of-the-art equipment. We replace a failing battery before it leaves your driver stranded, not after. Over a twelve-month period, our model reduces your total cost of ownership by minimising downtime, which, as your own data shows, is a far greater expense than the cost of any single service.”

A flicker of something – respect, perhaps – passed through Mr. Collier’s cold eyes. She had used his own logic against him. She had spoken the language of spreadsheets. Mark Henderson smiled, clearly pleased. “That’s what I liked about your thinking, Kathleen. You’re not just a mechanic; you’re a business partner. You’ve thought about our business, not just your own.” He then changed tack. “You mention investment in new technology. What are we talking about, specifically?” This was safer ground. She launched into a confident description of the new diagnostic tablet, its capabilities, its software updates. She spoke of Liam’s “intensive training” on the new system and the ‘Priority Fleet Bay’ they had established to streamline workflow on contract vehicles. She painted a picture of a garage that was a model of modern efficiency, a well-oiled machine.

The meeting seemed to be going impossibly well. Kath felt a dangerous flicker of hope. She had built a fortress of words, and they were buying it. Then came the attack she hadn't fully prepared for. Mark leaned back in his chair, his expression open and friendly. “This all sounds fantastic. I have a gap in my schedule this afternoon. I’d love to pop over and see this operation for myself. See the new bay, meet your technician. It’s always good to put a face to the name and see the workshop in person before we sign on the dotted line.” The words hit Kath with the force of a physical blow. Her blood ran cold. The stage set was just that – a set. It wouldn't stand up to a real-life inspection. The dead tow truck sat in the yard like a beached whale. Liam was just Liam, not some highly-trained fleet technician. It was over. The bluff had been called.

A thousand panicked thoughts screamed through her mind. She could lie, say she had to leave town, that there was a family emergency. But the excuse was flimsy, unprofessional. The silence stretched, becoming a vast, damning chasm. She looked out of the huge window, at the toy-sized cars moving through the streets below. Her city. Her garage. She wasn't going to lose it now. She summoned every last atom of her nerve, turned back to Mark, and produced a calm, considered smile. “I’d be delighted to show you the workshop, Mr. Henderson. It’s important you feel confident in our facilities.” She saw the relief on his face. She hadn’t finished. “However, as I’m sure you’ll appreciate, a dynamic workshop is, by its nature, often chaotic. At this very moment, your potential Priority Bay is occupied by a complex engine-out job on a classic Aston Martin. It’s a long-term client, a full restoration. The place is organised chaos. To be honest, I’d be embarrassed to show it to you in that state.” She let that sink in, the mention of a high-value classic car a subtle but powerful piece of misdirection. “What I’d prefer,” she continued, pressing her advantage, “is for you to visit us next week, once we’ve formally begun the partnership. I’ll have the bay cleared and prepped. You can see the process as we onboard your first vehicle. That way, you’re not just seeing an empty workshop; you’re seeing your investment in action.”

It was the most audacious lie of her life, a multi-layered masterpiece of bravado and strategic thinking. She was not just deflecting his request; she was reframing it as a benefit to him, using his own business logic to postpone the moment of truth. Mark and Mr. Collier exchanged a long, unreadable look. Kath held her breath, her entire future balanced on the knife-edge of their decision. She could hear the blood pounding in her ears. Finally, Mark Henderson broke into a broad grin. He shook his head slightly, a look of genuine admiration on his face. “Miss Price,” he said, his voice full of warmth. “You are an impressive operator. That’s a very sensible and professional suggestion.” He stood up and extended his hand across the vast table. “Let’s do that. In the meantime… welcome to the team.”

Kath shook his hand, a detached part of her brain registering the firm grip, the warmth of his skin. The rest of her was floating somewhere high above the city, looking down on the impossible scene. She had done it. The bluff had held. The contract was hers. As she walked out of the boardroom, her legs feeling like hollow tubes, the reality began to crash in. She had not solved her problem. She had exchanged a crisis for a catastrophe. She had won the battle, and in doing so, had committed herself to fighting a war she had absolutely no idea how to win. The handshake hadn't been an ending; it was the starting pistol for the most terrifying race of her life.The journey down in the silent, wood-panelled elevator was a descent from the stratosphere back into the crushing gravity of her own life. Kath stepped out into the lobby, the noise of her own blood roaring in her ears, and walked towards the glass doors. She didn’t see the smiling receptionist or the tasteful modern art on the walls. She was a deep-sea diver surfacing too fast, her body still trying to adjust to the impossible pressure change. She pushed through the doors and the cold, damp Leeds air hit her face. It felt real. The rumble of a passing bus, the smell of exhaust fumes, the distant shout of a street vendor – it was all brutally, terrifyingly real. She had won. And she was utterly, comprehensively ruined.

She walked. She didn’t know where she was going, just that she needed to feel the cracked paving stones under her feet. Her mind was a frantic kaleidoscope of images: Mark Henderson’s smiling, trusting face; Mr. Collier’s cold, calculating eyes; the vast, dead hulk of her tow truck; the stack of brown envelopes on her desk at home. Every lie she had told in that boardroom now felt like a brick she had tied to her own ankles before jumping into a very deep river. A strategic recovery partner. An SLA. A 24-hour fleet hotline. A Priority Fleet Bay. An Aston Martin restoration. The lies had been so beautiful, so seamless. They had formed a perfect, shimmering bubble, and now she had to somehow build a real, solid world inside that bubble before it popped.

When she finally saw the familiar, peeling paint of the garage sign, it looked alien, like a relic from a past life. She pushed open the heavy door to the small reception area, the bell above it giving a weak, pathetic jingle. Liam was standing there, pretending to wipe down the counter, but his posture was rigid with anticipation. He looked up the moment she came in, his young face a mess of hope and fear. He didn’t have to ask the question. His eyes screamed it.

Kath closed the door behind her, the click of the latch sounding unnaturally loud. She leaned back against it, feeling the cold wood through her blazer. “We got it,” she said, her voice a flat, toneless whisper. For a second, Liam just stared, processing the words. A slow, incredulous smile started to spread across his face. A spark of pure, unadulterated triumph lit his eyes. “Get in! You actually did it! I knew you would!” He almost bounced on the balls of his feet, the relief making him giddy. Then he saw her face. The smile vanished. The spark of triumph was instantly extinguished, replaced by the dawning horror of shared understanding. “Oh,” he said, the word small and weak. “Oh, right. We got it.”

“Yeah,” Kath said, pushing herself off the door and walking past him into the main workshop. Her gaze went straight to the dead tow truck. It dominated the space, a monument to their impossibility. “We got it. We have a week to become the business I just described in a twenty-page document. One week until Mark Henderson comes here to see his ‘investment in action’. One week until the first of his fifty vans could break down. And in six days, I owe the council three hundred quid and the leasing company another two hundred for a tablet we can’t afford.” She turned to face him, the full, crushing weight of her victory settling on her shoulders. “So yeah, Liam. We’re in business.”

Liam swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing. The giddiness was gone, replaced by a pale, sober focus. He was no longer a bored apprentice. He was her second-in-command, her sole crewmate on a ship that was already taking on water. “Right,” he said, his voice steadier than she expected. “The whiteboard?” Kath gave a grim, approving nod. The whiteboard had become their altar, the place they made their sacrifices and prayed for miracles. They dragged it into the centre of the floor, and Kath grabbed the marker. This time, there was no ‘FAILURES’ or ‘OPPORTUNITIES’. At the top, in huge, blocky letters, she wrote: ‘THE LIES’.

One by one, she listed them, her voice a low, urgent murmur as she wrote.
1.  **Strategic Recovery Partner (SLA/60 min response).**
2.  **24/7 Fleet Hotline.**
3.  **Dedicated ‘Priority Fleet Bay’ (Clean & Prepped).**
4.  **‘Engine-out job on a classic Aston Martin’.**
5.  **General impression of being a solvent, functional business.**

She underlined the last one three times. They stood there for a long moment, staring at the list. It was a blueprint for their own elaborate trap. “Okay,” Liam said, pointing a greasy finger at the board. “Number one. Davey. Did you get a price?” “No,” Kath admitted. “He said to send him the details. He wants to meet. On his turf.” Liam winced. “He’ll try and fleece you.” “I know,” Kath said. “But he doesn’t know how badly we need him. As far as he’s concerned, we’re the client with the big fleet contract. We have the leverage, even if it’s imaginary.”

“Number two,” Liam continued, moving down the list. “The hotline. What’s that, then? Your mobile?” “It’ll have to be,” Kath said, already thinking. “I’ll get a new pay-as-you-go SIM. We’ll get a cheap, basic phone. That’s the ‘hotline’. I’ll divert it to my own mobile after hours. I just won’t sleep for the next five years.” A flicker of dark humour passed between them. It felt better than crying. The Priority Bay they could handle. That was just paint and tidying. But the Aston Martin was a problem. It represented the need to look busy, professional, and successful. Their current main job was replacing the exhaust on a ten-year-old Nissan Micra.

The real mountain was the problem not on the list, the one sitting ten feet away, leaking oil onto a drip tray. The truck. Even with Davey’s partnership, they couldn’t function long-term without their own recovery vehicle. It was the heart of the business her dad had built. She walked over to the office desk, past the little plastic man she hadn't had time to consult, and started calling breaker’s yards. She gave them the truck’s registration, the engine model. The responses were all variations on the same theme. A reconditioned engine, if they could even source one, would be five thousand pounds. Fitting it would be another grand in labour and parts. Six thousand pounds. It was a number from a different planet.

She hung up after the third call, a cold, quiet despair settling over her. She couldn’t see a way through. The numbers wouldn’t add up. She had bluffed her way into the game, but she didn’t have the money for a seat at the table. She ran a hand through her messy hair, her eyes scanning the garage, searching for a solution, for anything of value. Her gaze fell on a dark corner, a corner she rarely looked at. It was her dad’s corner. His old, heavy-duty toolbox, a magnificent, custom-built Snap-on chest he had spent a fortune on decades ago, sat gleaming dully under a film of dust. Next to it, leaning against the wall, were his vintage motorcycle racing leathers from his youth, cracked and faded but still exuding a ghost of his former, reckless self. And under a tarp, the project he was working on when he died: the half-restored shell of a 1968 Triumph Bonneville motorcycle. His pride and joy. His legacy.

The thought was a betrayal, a sacrilege that made her feel physically sick. But it was also a number. The toolbox alone was worth a couple of grand to a collector. The bike, even in its current state, was worth more. Combined… it might be enough. It might be the price of the engine. She felt a tear, hot and sharp, track down her grimy cheek. She was being asked to literally sell her father’s memory to fund the future he’d left her in.

Liam saw the direction of her gaze, saw the single tear, and he understood instantly. He walked over, his usual awkwardness gone, and stood beside her, looking at the dusty corner. “My grandad had one of them bikes,” he said quietly, his voice surprisingly gentle. “Sold it to pay for my mam’s wedding.” He didn’t say anything else. He didn’t need to. He just stood there, a silent witness to her impossible choice. Kath wiped the tear away with the back of her hand, leaving a greasy streak. The sentimentality, the grief, it was a luxury she couldn't afford. She was a business owner, and these were under-utilised assets. She took a deep, shuddering breath, her decision made. “Liam,” she said, her voice hollowed out but firm. “Go get the new phone. The one for the hotline. Then start painting the floor for the bay. I’ve got some more calls to make.” As he walked away, she pulled out her mobile, her thumb hovering over the number for a local classic vehicle specialist. She took one last look at her dad’s corner, at the ghosts of his passions, and said a silent, bitter goodbye.The phone calls were the hardest part. Each number she dialled felt like a betrayal. The first was to a man who specialised in vintage motorcycle restorations, his voice a smooth, knowledgeable purr that made Kath’s stomach churn. She described the Triumph Bonneville, its condition, the parts that were boxed and labelled, the V5C document tucked away in her dad's old filing cabinet. The man’s interest was immediate and predatory. He didn’t ask why she was selling; he only cared about the originality of the engine block and the condition of the frame. The second call, to a dealer in high-end used tools, was even worse. She listed the contents of the Snap-on chest, the rows of perfectly maintained sockets, wrenches, and specialist pullers. The man on the other end whistled, a low, appreciative sound. “That’s a retirement chest, love,” he’d said. “A man builds a collection like that over a lifetime.” The words were a knife in her gut. She knew. That was precisely the problem.

They came the next afternoon, two separate vultures arriving within an hour of each other. The bike specialist, a man named Marcus with soft hands and a cashmere scarf, walked around the tarp-covered Triumph, his eyes scanning every inch. He lifted the tarp with a reverence that felt obscene, his fingers tracing the curve of the fuel tank, peering at the engine number stamped into the casing. He spoke in low tones about market values, auction prices, and the cost of the restoration work still required. Kath stood with her arms crossed, a silent, stony guardian of her father’s ghost, listening to his passion being broken down into pounds and pence. He made an offer. It was five hundred pounds less than she had hoped for, but it was a solid, real number. It was cash. She just nodded, her throat too tight to speak.

The tool dealer was a different breed entirely. A bluff, red-faced man named Barry, he opened the drawers of the Snap-on chest with a tradesman’s familiarity, his eyes lighting up at the sight of the pristine, ordered rows of chrome-vanadium steel. He picked up her dad’s favourite ratchet, its handle worn smooth from years of use, and tested its fine-toothed mechanism with an expert click-click-click. “He looked after his gear, your dad,” Barry said, and the simple, honest statement was somehow more painful than Marcus’s condescending expertise. He, too, made an offer. It was also less than she’d hoped for, a price that accounted for his own profit margin, but again, it was real. It was immediate. Kath nodded again. An hour later, the corner of the garage was devastatingly empty. The space where the bike had waited patiently for a future that would never come was now just a dark patch on the concrete floor. The magnificent red tool chest was gone, leaving a clean rectangle of dust behind it. In a battered biscuit tin on her office desk sat seven thousand, two hundred pounds in crisp, used notes. It felt like the heaviest, dirtiest money she had ever touched.

The meeting with Davey was the next hurdle. His yard was on the other side of the city, a sprawling, gravelled expanse packed with the crumpled remains of car crashes and the sad, rusting hulks of abandoned vehicles. It was bigger, busier, and more brutally efficient than her own garage. Davey’s office was a Portakabin with a window that overlooked his grim kingdom. He sat behind a large metal desk, a bulldog of a man with a thick neck and suspicious eyes. He didn’t offer Kath a seat or a drink. “Right then, Price,” he grunted, leaning back in his creaking chair. “Talk.” Kath didn’t flinch. She had rehearsed this. She wasn't the desperate girl whose dad he used to argue with. She was a potential major client. She calmly laid out the terms of her proposal: a twelve-month exclusive contract for all recovery and roadside assistance work generated by a fifty-van commercial fleet. She spoke of guaranteed monthly volumes, prompt payment terms, and the potential for contract renewal and expansion. She never once mentioned her own broken truck.

Davey listened, his eyes narrowed, trying to find the catch. “Fifty vans?” he said, the greed warring with his inherent distrust. “What fleet?” Kath smiled, a cool, business-like expression she had practiced in the mirror. “I’m not at liberty to disclose the client’s name until the contract is signed, for confidentiality reasons,” she said, the lie tasting surprisingly natural. “But I can tell you it’s a major city-based logistics firm. The decision is between establishing our own in-house recovery provision or partnering with a reliable external supplier. I’m giving you the first refusal.” The lie was brilliant in its simplicity. She was offering him the chance to save her from a problem he didn't even know she had. After twenty minutes of terse, hard-nosed negotiation over rates and response times, they had a deal. Davey scribbled the terms on a sheet of paper, and they both signed it. His handshake was rough and reluctant, but it was a deal nonetheless. As Kath walked away from his grim Portakabin, she didn't feel triumphant, just hollowed out. She had sold her father’s past and mortgaged her own future in the space of twenty-four hours.

The next forty-eight hours were a blur of frantic, purposeful work. The first thing Kath did was call the engine supplier. With a voice that was perfectly steady, she ordered a fully reconditioned engine for her make and model of truck, quoting the part number from memory. She paid the six-thousand-pound bill over the phone using the debit card linked to her now miraculously solvent business account. The money was gone as quickly as it had arrived. The engine would be delivered in five to seven working days. They had a week. It was a week she didn't have. With that done, she and Liam unleashed a storm of activity on the garage. Liam, galvanised by the sheer insanity of it all, took ownership of creating the Priority Fleet Bay. He used industrial floor paint to mark out a large, pristine-looking bay right by the main shutter doors, stencilling ‘FLEET PRIORITY VEHICLE’ in bold yellow letters. He assembled a dedicated tool trolley, stocking it with new, gleaming sets of wrenches and sockets Kath had bought with the leftover cash. The bay looked professional, efficient, and completely devoid of any actual work.

Kath, meanwhile, tackled the problem of the Aston Martin. Rummaging in the deepest, dustiest corner of the storeroom, she found what she was looking for: a huge, tailored, dark green car cover that had come with a classic Jaguar her dad had worked on years ago. They dragged it out and carefully draped it over the long-suffering Nissan Micra, which was still waiting for its exhaust. The cheap, small car was instantly transformed into a mysterious, high-value project. The cover clung to its shape in all the wrong places, but from a distance, it created an illusion of prestige. Kath artfully scattered a few obscure, specialist-looking tools on a workbench nearby and placed a hefty, ancient workshop manual for a V12 engine next to them. It was pure theatre, a stage set for a one-act play about a thriving business. That evening, Kath sat alone in the quiet office, the new ‘hotline’ phone charging on the desk beside her. The garage was cleaner and more organised than it had ever been, but the empty corner where her dad’s things had been was a gaping wound. The grief she had held at bay all day washed over her. She picked up Dr. Alistair Finch from his spot and held his small, plastic form in her hand. “I sold it all, Alistair,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “His whole life’s hobby. Everything he loved. Just… for the money. What would he think?” In the silence, she didn’t imagine an academic analysis. She imagined her dad. She saw his face, covered in grease, squinting at a stubborn bolt. She heard his gruff voice. He hadn’t been a sentimental man. He’d been a pragmatist, a survivor. He loved the bike, yes. But he loved the garage more. And he would have hated, more than anything, to see it fail. *‘It’s just metal, Kath,’* she heard him say in her memory. *‘It’s the name over the door that matters.’* A single tear splashed onto the desk. She wiped it away. The grief was still there, but beneath it, something hard and resolute was setting. The price had been paid. Now she just had to prove it was worth it.The first day of the rest of her life began with the oppressive silence of a cheap, black burner phone. It sat on the corner of her desk like a small, plastic hand-grenade, fully charged and ominously silent. Kath and Liam moved around the newly organised garage with the twitchy, heightened awareness of actors waiting for their cue. Every car that drove past the open shutters made them jump. Every distant ring of a telephone from a neighbouring business sent a jolt of adrenaline through Kath’s veins. The garage had never been so clean, so orderly. It felt less like a working garage and more like a museum exhibit of one, with the gleaming Priority Bay and the mysterious, shrouded car as its centrepieces. It was a stage, and they were waiting, terrified, for the curtain to rise.

The hotline rang for the first time on Monday afternoon. The shrill, unfamiliar ringtone cut through the air, and both Kath and Liam froze solid. Kath snatched it up, her heart hammering against her ribs, her voice a pitch-perfect imitation of calm professionalism. “Fleet Support, how can I help?” It wasn’t a breakdown. It was Mark Henderson’s impossibly cheerful assistant, Jessica, calling to schedule the first vehicle for its ‘initial diagnostic and fleet onboarding’. A brand-new Ford Transit, she explained, would be dropping by tomorrow morning. It was a test, Kath knew. A gentle, probing first move to see if the reality matched the proposal. She agreed, her voice smooth and even, confirming the time and taking the vehicle’s registration number. As she hung up, she met Liam’s wide, terrified eyes across the workshop floor. The show was on.

The Ford Transit that arrived the next morning was so new and clean it seemed to suck the light from the grimy corners of the garage. The driver, a cheerful man in a crisp uniform, handed her a pristine set of keys attached to a branded key-fob. He looked around the workshop, his gaze lingering on the neatly painted Priority Bay and the shrouded ‘Aston Martin’. “Nice setup,” he commented, clearly impressed. The compliment hit Kath with a pang of guilt so sharp it was almost a physical pain. She forced a smile and directed him to the small, clean waiting area she had created by the office, complete with a two-day-old copy of a car magazine. “Our lead technician will get right on it,” she said, gesturing towards Liam with a confidence she felt nowhere in her body.

Liam, scrubbed into a clean set of overalls, approached the van with the solemnity of a bomb disposal expert. This was his moment. He plugged the new diagnostic tablet into the van’s port, its bright, colourful screen a stark contrast to the dark, greasy work he was used to. Kath watched from a distance, pretending to be busy with paperwork but in reality, tracking his every move. She saw the slight tremor in his hands as he navigated the software, his brow furrowed in concentration. For ten long minutes, he worked in silence, tapping and swiping, running the system checks she had drilled him on the night before. Then, with a quiet beep, the tablet produced a comprehensive, multi-page report detailing the van’s perfect, factory-fresh health. Liam printed it, the whir of the cheap office printer sounding like a hymn of victory. He clipped it to a new clipboard and, with a nod to Kath, walked over to the driver. He explained the report clearly and concisely, just as they had rehearsed, his voice not betraying a hint of the terror she knew he was feeling.

That evening, long after the driver had left with a smile and a promise to tell his colleagues how professional the new garage was, Kath sat at her desk and created her first invoice for Henderson Logistics. The act felt momentous, surreal. She typed in the company’s full address, the VAT number from their website, and the agreed-upon, pre-negotiated rate for an ‘Onboarding Diagnostic Service’. It was the first tangible return on her catastrophic gamble. She emailed the PDF, the quiet ‘whoosh’ of the sent mail a small, significant sound in the quiet garage. They had done it. They had survived the first day of their new reality. They had performed their lie flawlessly. But the relief was fleeting, immediately replaced by the cold, heavy presence of another problem.

The dead tow truck sat in the yard like a decaying whale, a constant, unavoidable reminder of their fraud. They couldn't leave it there. It was the first thing anyone saw when they pulled onto the forecourt. If Henderson did decide to pop by, it would be the first question he’d ask. The new engine wasn’t due for another four days, and that was an optimistic estimate. They had to hide the body. The task was a grim, silent struggle. Using two heavy-duty trolley jacks and a collection of thick wooden blocks, they began the Herculean task of moving the ten-tonne vehicle to the very back of the yard. It was back-breaking, dangerous work. Every creak of the jacks, every groan of the truck’s chassis, sounded like an accusation. It took them nearly two hours to inch it backwards, centimetre by centimetre, until it was tucked away behind a tall, precarious stack of old tyres and a derelict skip. It was still visible if you knew where to look, but it was no longer the centrepiece of their failure. Exhausted, covered in a fresh layer of grime and sweat, they stood side-by-side, looking at the hidden disaster.

Her nightly debrief with Dr. Alistair Finch became less about academic theory and more about battlefield reporting. She was too exhausted to even open the textbook. She just slumped at the kitchen table, the hotline phone next to her silent and menacing, and recounted the day’s events to the small plastic man. “The tablet worked, Alistair,” she murmured, rubbing her aching eyes. “Liam was brilliant. He didn’t miss a beat. He even called himself a ‘lead technician’ with a straight face.” A weak smile touched her lips. “And I told the driver the Micra was an Aston Martin. An Aston Martin! He just nodded. People will believe anything if you say it with enough confidence.” She picked him up, his smooth, cool plastic a small point of solid reality in her swirling vortex of lies. “We’re getting away with it,” she whispered, as if the walls might be listening. “So far.”

The next two days passed in a similar state of high-alert anxiety. A second Henderson van came in for a scheduled tyre check. Another flawless performance, another invoice sent. Kath spent hours on the phone, chasing down the best possible prices for the bulk order of service parts she would need, using the Henderson name as a battering ram to get better terms. Liam, in between the staged performances, worked on the garage’s genuine jobs with a new focus, aware that every paying customer was vital fuel for their burning enterprise. The lie was becoming a routine. The constant, gnawing fear was starting to feel normal. But the deadline of Henderson’s visit loomed ever larger, and the new engine for the truck had not yet arrived. The carefully constructed stage was holding, but the foundations were nothing more than a prayer.The first payment from Henderson Logistics arrived in her bank account on Thursday morning. It wasn’t a huge amount, just the fee for the first two diagnostic services, but seeing it there on her banking app, a solid black number in a sea of red, felt like witnessing a miracle. It was real. The lie was generating actual, legitimate income. For a dizzying moment, Kath allowed herself to feel a flicker of genuine hope. She showed the screen to Liam, and his answering grin was wide and uncomplicated. For him, it was simple: their insane plan was working. Kath, however, knew it was just the first instalment on a debt of lies that was growing larger by the day.

The engine supplier had called to confirm a delivery date: the following Monday. It was a small mercy, but it meant the dead truck would have to remain hidden for Henderson’s visit. The thought sent a fresh wave of anxiety through her. The weekend stretched before them, a 48-hour period where anything could go wrong, where a single phone call could bring the entire, fragile edifice crashing down around them. She spent Friday afternoon making the two payments that had haunted her for months. Three hundred pounds to the council. Two hundred pounds to the leasing company. The transactions were completed with a few simple clicks, a depressingly mundane end to a period of such profound terror. There was no fanfare, no acknowledgement of the Herculean effort it had taken to find that money. It was just gone, and her bank balance was perilously low once more.

The call came on Saturday, just after midday. Kath and Liam were eating sandwiches from the corner shop, a rare moment of quiet in the middle of a gearbox replacement on an old Peugeot. The jarring, electronic ringtone of the burner phone sliced through the relative peace of the garage. It was a sound that bypassed the ear and went straight to the nervous system. Kath’s sandwich turned to cardboard in her mouth. She snatched up the phone, her thumb fumbling on the green button. “Fleet Support,” she said, her voice a croak that she instantly cleared into something more professional.

“Hello? Is that the garage?” The voice was young, panicked, and distorted by the wind. “It’s Dan, from Henderson’s. Van 17. I’m on the A64, just past the roundabout at Whinmoor. The engine just cut out. Just… died. There was a bang and a load of smoke and now it’s dead. I’m stuck in the outside lane.” The words came in a torrent, a cascade of pure, unadulterated disaster. The outside lane. The busiest A-road out of the city. A brand-new van, dead as a stone. This wasn’t a gentle test. This was a full-blown, five-alarm crisis. Kath’s mind went terrifyingly blank for a split second, a white screen of pure panic. Then, the training, the role-playing, the nights spent talking to Alistair, all kicked in. She was Kathleen Price, Managing Director.

“Okay, Dan. Stay calm,” she said, her voice an oasis of authority she did not feel. She grabbed a pen and a notepad. “Are your hazard lights on? Are you safe?” She took his details, confirmed the precise location, and reassured him that a recovery unit was being dispatched immediately. “I want you to get out of the vehicle if it’s safe to do so, and get over the barrier onto the verge. The unit will be with you within the hour. I’ll call you back with an ETA in five minutes.” She hung up and stared at Liam, her face pale. “A64. Outside lane. Snapped timing belt by the sound of it.” Liam’s eyes were wide. “That’s Davey’s patch,” he said, stating the obvious.

With a hand that was surprisingly steady, Kath dialled Davey’s number. The gruff voice answered on the second ring. “Davey.” Kath didn't waste time on pleasantries. “Davey, it’s Kath Price. I’m activating the fleet SLA. I have a new Transit van, broken down, outside lane of the A64 at Whinmoor. The driver is in a position of high risk. I need your fastest response. The job number is H-L-003.” She used the formal job number she had invented on the spot, the corporate language a shield against the history and animosity between them. There was a pause. She could hear the faint sound of a radio in the background of his office. “The A64 on a Saturday?” Davey grunted. “It’s chaos up there. It’ll cost you. That’s a premium call-out.” “I’m aware of that,” Kath said, her voice like ice. “Your signed agreement states a sixty-minute response time for high-risk locations. The clock is ticking.” There was another pause, a moment of calculation she could almost feel down the phone line. Then, the grudging professionalism she was gambling on kicked in. “Right. My lad’s just finishing up in town. I’ll send him now. He’ll be there inside forty minutes.”

The next forty minutes were the longest of Kath’s life. She called the driver, Dan, back, and relayed the ETA, her calm voice a blatant lie masking the frantic turmoil in her gut. She was powerless. Her entire contract, her reputation, the future of her business, was now in the hands of a man she wouldn’t trust to post a letter for her. She couldn’t pace; it would betray her anxiety to Liam. So she stood by the office desk, her arms crossed, staring at the silent hotline phone as if she could make it ring with good news through sheer force of will. Liam, wisely, said nothing. He just went back to the Peugeot gearbox, the rhythmic clank of his tools a small, steady counterpoint to Kath’s spiralling nerves. She had never known a silence so loud.

The hotline rang again. It was thirty-five minutes after her call to Davey. She snatched it up. “Fleet Support.” It was a different voice, calm and local. “It’s Gaz, from Davey’s Recovery. I’m on scene with your Transit on the A64. The driver is safe. The belt’s gone, alright. Engine’s trashed. I’m hooking it up now. Where do you want it?” The wave of relief was so profound, so total, that Kath’s knees almost buckled. She had to grip the desk to stay upright. Her system, her insane, cobbled-together network of bluffs and subcontracted lies, had actually worked. “Bring it to the garage,” she instructed, her voice miraculously steady. “Back it straight into the Priority Bay.”

An hour later, the hulking form of Davey’s gleaming, new recovery truck reversed into her yard, its amber lights flashing, casting long, dancing shadows across the grimy brickwork. It was a magnificent, powerful machine, everything her own truck wasn't. The driver, Gaz, a competent-looking man in a clean, high-vis jacket, operated the controls with smooth efficiency, lowering the broken-down Henderson van onto her workshop floor. It was a strange, humiliating, and profoundly triumphant moment. Her rival was delivering work to her door. Liam guided the van into the freshly painted bay, and Gaz unhooked it, his movements economical and professional. He passed Kath a docket to sign. “Nice setup you’ve got here,” he said, his eyes taking in the clean bay and the mysterious shrouded car. “Davey said you were expanding.”

Kath signed the docket, her hand moving over the paper. “We are,” she said, looking at the brand-new, broken-down van sitting in her Priority Bay. It was a disaster, a huge, expensive warranty job that would bring in no profit. But it was also a masterpiece. It was proof of concept. The lie was alive. She was no longer just a mechanic waiting for work. She was a logistics manager, coordinating a network, solving problems. She watched Davey’s truck pull away, leaving her with the spoils of her terrifying new victory. The old Kath would have been under the bonnet by now, her hands already covered in oil. The new Kath stood back, clipboard in hand, looking at the problem. Her first thought wasn’t how to fix it, but how to manage the process. “Liam,” she said, her voice calm and full of a new, cold authority. “Get on the phone to Ford. We need to start the warranty claim process. I’ll update the client.” The transformation was complete.The silence that followed Kath’s order was thick with unspoken implications. Liam stared at the dead Ford Transit, a brand new vehicle with a hole blown through the heart of its engine, now occupying the pristine bay he had so carefully painted. It was a beautiful, terrible symbol of their new reality. He had expected Kath to be grabbing her tools, diving under the bonnet in a furious flurry of diagnostic activity. Instead, she was talking about warranty claims and client updates. She hadn't even touched the vehicle. A new and unfamiliar respect, mingled with fear, settled in his gut. This wasn't just Kath, the boss who was better with a spanner than he was. This was someone else entirely. He gave a single, sharp nod, wiped his hands on a rag, and walked towards the office phone with the grim determination of a soldier marching into a minefield.

Kath let him go. She needed to trust him with this, to empower him as the ‘lead technician’ she had invented. Her own battle was with a different kind of machinery. She picked up the burner phone, the ‘hotline’, and found Mark Henderson’s number. Her thumb hovered over the contact. How did you frame a catastrophe as a capability demonstration? The words she’d rehearsed in the frantic moments before the recovery now felt thin and hollow. She took a deep breath, picturing Mr. Collier’s cold, analytical eyes. She had to speak his language, the language of outcomes and mitigated risks. She dialled.

“Mark Henderson’s office,” Jessica’s bright voice chirped.
“Jessica, hi, it’s Kathleen Price at Price’s Garage,” Kath said, her voice a cool, measured instrument. “Could I have a moment with Mark? It’s an operational update regarding the fleet.”
A moment later, Henderson’s warm, confident voice was on the line. “Kathleen. Everything alright?”
“Everything is under control, Mark,” she began, choosing her words with surgical precision. “I’m calling to let you know we had a successful full-scale activation of the emergency response protocol this afternoon for your Van 17. The driver reported a major vehicle-off-road incident on the A64. Our system was initiated, a recovery unit was dispatched, and the driver and vehicle were safely recovered to our workshop well within the sixty-minute SLA framework we discussed.”

There was a stunned silence on the other end of the line. She had taken his brand new, broken-down van and presented it to him as a successful case study. She pressed on before he could speak. “Initial diagnostics suggest a catastrophic engine failure, almost certainly a primary manufacturing defect. But my main purpose in calling was to reassure you that the driver, Dan, is safe and unharmed, and that the support system you’ve invested in has performed exactly as specified. Liam, my lead technician, is already liaising with Ford to initiate a priority warranty claim. We’ll manage the entire process and keep you updated every step of the way.”

The silence stretched for another second, then Henderson let out a low whistle. “Wow. Okay. Well, that’s not the news I was expecting, but… damn, Kathleen. That’s an impressive response. I’m glad Dan is safe. You’ve already spoken to Ford?”
“We have,” she lied, banking on Liam’s immediate success. “We understand that vehicle downtime is your critical cost, so we move fast. The van is secure in our priority bay now.”
“Excellent. This is exactly why we chose you,” Henderson said, his voice full of genuine conviction. “Keep me in the loop on the warranty progress.”

Kath hung up the phone, her body trembling with the aftershocks of the adrenaline and the audacity of her own performance. She looked through the office window at Liam, who was on the phone to Ford, a notepad in front of him, jotting down details. He was nodding, his expression serious, his voice low and firm. He was using phrases she had used on him just days ago. ‘Case reference number’. ‘Escalation procedure’. He was learning the language. He was becoming the lie.

The following week, the garage operated on a new, strange rhythm. The dead Transit sat in the Priority Bay, a patient in intensive care waiting for a donor organ from the main Ford hospital. It was a constant, powerful visual for every customer who came in, a silent testament to the garage’s new, important client. Kath became a logistics coordinator, a switchboard operator, a professional chaser of parts and paperwork. She spent hours navigating Ford’s labyrinthine warranty department, a bureaucratic maze designed to wear you down. But Kath, newly fluent in the language of polite, implacable persistence, did not wear down. She documented every call, every broken promise, every name and date, building a chain of evidence. Meanwhile, Liam handled the actual mechanical work, the bread-and-butter jobs on clutches and brakes that paid the wages and kept the lights on. The dynamic between them had fundamentally shifted. She was the architect; he was the builder. And the shrouded ‘Aston Martin’ sat in the corner, a silent, faintly ridiculous accomplice in their grand deception.

The new engine for the tow truck arrived on Monday afternoon, delivered by a haulage company on a huge pallet. It was a magnificent, terrifying object, a dense block of reconditioned metal and precisely engineered components that represented the entirety of her father’s legacy, converted into cash and then back into machinery. It was their salvation and her sacrilege, all in one. There was no time for sentiment. With the Henderson visit now confirmed for the end of the week, they had just four days to perform a full engine transplant. It was a huge, complex, filthy job, the kind of work Kath knew in her bones. For the first time in weeks, she pulled on her old, oil-soaked overalls, the familiar fabric a comfort against her skin.

For the next four days, she and Liam worked with a frantic, symbiotic intensity. They turned the garage back into what it was always meant to be: a place of grease, sweat, and focused mechanical violence. They hoisted the old, dead engine out of the truck’s vast bonnet, a messy, brutal extraction like pulling a rotten tooth. They cleaned the engine bay until it was spotless, replacing frayed hoses and corroded connectors. Then, with agonizing slowness and precision, they lowered the new engine into place. It was a ballet of grunting effort and delicate adjustments, a dance of chains, levers, and shouted instructions. Kath was back in her element. Her hands, which had been learning the unfamiliar landscape of a keyboard and a smartphone, were now remembering the familiar feel of a torque wrench, the specific resistance of a tightly-seated bolt. The lies and the bluffs fell away, replaced by the solid, honest logic of the internal combustion engine. This was real. This was truth.

On Thursday evening, hours after any sane person would have gone home, they were ready. The last hose was connected, the last drop of oil added. Kath climbed into the cab of the tow truck, her heart in her mouth. The cab smelled of her dad, a faint, lingering scent of stale coffee and cigarettes. She turned the key. The starter motor whirred, engaged, and then, with a deep, throaty roar, the new engine fired into life. It wasn't the clattering, tired rumble of the old unit. It was a smooth, powerful, confident sound. The sound of seven thousand, two hundred pounds. The sound of a future. Liam, standing on the workshop floor, broke into a wide, exhausted, grease-smeared grin and gave her a thumbs-up. Kath leaned her forehead against the cool glass of the windscreen and closed her eyes, the steady, powerful vibration of the engine running up through the seat into her bones. They were back. They were whole again. And just in time. Mark Henderson was due in sixteen hours.The morning was a frantic, whispered ballet of final preparations. Kath and Liam moved through the garage like ghosts on a deadline, fueled by cheap, strong tea and the raw, jagged energy of adrenaline. They swept the floor for the tenth time, wiped down surfaces that were already clean, and straightened tools that were already perfectly aligned. The air was thick with the faint, clean smell of the new engine’s paint burning off, a scent that mingled with the familiar notes of oil and petrol to create something new: the smell of a second chance. The tow truck, now their resurrected phoenix, was parked prominently at the side of the yard, its bodywork gleaming with a hasty polish, its presence a bold, defiant statement. The lie was set. The stage was dressed. They were ready.

When Mark Henderson’s dark grey Audi whispered onto the forecourt at precisely eleven o’clock, Kath’s heart performed a sickening lurch, then settled into a hard, steady rhythm. This was it. She met him at the office door, extending a steady hand, her voice a calm and welcoming instrument. “Mark, good to see you again. Welcome to Price’s Garage.” Henderson’s eyes did a slow, comprehensive sweep of the workshop. Kath saw him register the organised tool boards, the absence of clutter, the gleaming yellow lines of the Priority Bay. He didn’t look like a man inspecting a potential supplier; he looked like an investor surveying his new asset. His gaze fell on the shrouded car in the corner. “Is that the Aston?” he asked with a curious smile. Kath’s own smile didn’t flicker. “It is. A labour of love. And a lesson in patience.” The answer was brief, confident, and offered no further footholds for questions.

She led him first to the Priority Bay, to the dead Ford Transit. It was a risky opening move, confronting him immediately with his own broken vehicle, but it was also her strongest play. She didn't apologise for it; she presented it. On a small, clean table next to the van, she had a folder laid open. “As you can see, Van 17 is secure,” she began, her tone that of a consultant delivering a report. “We’ve logged the initial fault, and my lead technician has been managing the warranty claim with Ford. This,” she tapped the open folder, “is the full communication log, case reference numbers, and the preliminary report from the roadside recovery.” Henderson picked up the folder, his eyebrows rising as he scanned the neatly organised pages, the logs of calls, the names, the dates. He wasn't looking at a broken van; he was looking at a managed process. He was seeing his problem being solved, professionally and transparently.

“This is impressive, Kath,” he said, looking from the folder to the van. “You’ve turned a major headache into a simple process for me.”
“That’s the service you’re paying for, Mark,” she replied smoothly. “Your drivers drive. We handle the rest.”
At that moment, as if on cue, Liam emerged from the back, wiping his hands on a clean rag. He wore the new overalls, his hair was combed, and he carried an air of quiet competence that was worlds away from the sullen teenager he had been just weeks ago. “Kathleen,” he said, his voice formal. “Ford have confirmed they’re shipping the new engine unit directly to us. They’ve given me a consignment number for tracking.” The timing was so perfect it was almost comical. Kath made the introductions. “Mark, this is my lead technician, Liam. He’s the one who’s been wrestling with Ford’s bureaucracy on your behalf.”

Henderson shook Liam’s hand, a genuine warmth in his expression. “Good to meet you, Liam. Kathleen tells me you’re the expert on the new diagnostic systems.” Liam, to his eternal credit, didn’t blush or stammer. He simply nodded. “It’s a good piece of kit,” he said, with the understated confidence of a seasoned pro. “It allows us to get a full baseline of every vehicle on intake, so we can spot potential issues before they become roadside failures.” He had used her words, her philosophy. He had learned the script so well it had become his own. Kath felt a surge of pride so powerful it almost buckled her knees.

The final part of the tour was the tow truck. It sat outside, a beast reborn, its new engine humming with a low, powerful thrum. Henderson walked around it, his appreciative gaze taking in its sheer size and power. “This is your primary recovery asset, I take it?” he asked. Kath’s heart hammered against her ribs. This was the precipice. “It is,” she said, her voice steady. “We’ve just completed a full, preventative powertrain overhaul. New engine, new transmission fluid, new hydraulics. If we’re guaranteeing a sixty-minute response time from our partners, we need to have the in-house capability for direct recovery on the most critical jobs. I can’t have my key asset failing when one of your vehicles needs it. We’ve invested in reliability so you don’t have to worry about it.” The lie was breathtaking in its scope, turning her single greatest failure into his greatest reassurance. It was the keystone in the arch of her deception, and it clicked perfectly into place.

Back in the tiny, clean office, Henderson didn’t even sit down. He stood by the window, looking out at the garage, at Liam checking the tyre pressures on a customer’s car, at the tow truck humming quietly. He looked, Kath realised, completely and utterly sold. “You know, Kathleen,” he said, turning to face her, “when I read your proposal, I thought it was ambitious. I thought you were a small, old-school garage punching above your weight. I was wrong.” He gestured out at the workshop. “This isn’t just a garage. It’s an operation. You’ve built a system. You’ve thought about everything from a logistics perspective. It’s exactly what I was looking for.” He pulled a folded document from his jacket pocket. It was the contract. “My legal team has approved this. All it needs is our signatures.” He placed it on the desk and uncapped a heavy, expensive-looking fountain pen.

Kath stared at the document, at the final page where two blank lines waited. It was the culmination of everything. The desperate nights, the sale of her father’s memories, the terror, the lies. It was all there, distilled into a few pages of legal text. Her hand trembled almost imperceptibly as she took the pen from him and signed her name on the line marked ‘Managing Director, Price’s Garage’. Her signature, usually a hurried scrawl, was clear and deliberate. It felt like an act of creation. After he had signed his own name and they had shaken hands for the final time, he walked towards the door. He paused on the threshold. “By the way,” he said, a curious glint in his eye. “A word of advice. When that new Ford engine arrives, get your own technician to fit it. Don’t let their main dealer monkeys touch it. From what I’ve seen, I’d trust your man Liam over them any day.” And then he was gone.

For a long minute after the Audi had whispered away, Kath and Liam stood in a profound, ringing silence. They didn’t cheer or shout. The energy required for celebration had been utterly spent. They just stood on the workshop floor, surrounded by the evidence of their impossible victory. Liam finally broke the silence, his voice a quiet, awed whisper. “He called me a lead technician.” Kath looked at him, at the young man who had transformed before her very eyes, and a slow, genuine smile spread across her face. “That’s because you are one,” she said. Later that evening, after Liam had gone home, Kath stood alone in the quiet garage. The weight of the signed contract was a solid, reassuring presence in her bag. She walked over to the corner where the Triumph and the red toolbox used to be. The space was still painfully empty, a void filled with ghosts. But tonight, for the first time, the grief was not the only thing she felt. She felt a deep, aching sadness, but beneath it, there was a quiet, fierce sense of peace. The sacrifice had been brutal, but it had not been in vain. She reached into her pocket and pulled out the small, plastic figure of Dr. Alistair Finch. She looked from the impassive, academic face to the empty corner, and then back again. “Thank you,” she whispered, to him, to her dad, to the ghosts of the past. The garage was hers now, bought and paid for in every way a place could be. The lies were over. The work was just beginning.The Saturday after Henderson’s visit was the quietest, strangest day the garage had ever known. The adrenaline had finally burned itself out, leaving behind a deep, cellular exhaustion and a silence that felt heavy with the weight of un-started work. The signed contract, which Kath had brought home and placed on her kitchen table, was the first thing she saw when she woke up. It was no longer a terrifying symbol of her overreach; it was a work order. A vast, complex, terrifying work order. When she arrived at the garage, she found Liam already there, not slumped in a chair scrolling through his phone, but methodically cleaning the injectors from the Peugeot gearbox job. He looked up as she walked in, his eyes tired but clear. There was no need for triumphant cheers or giddy congratulations. They had shared the terror, and now they shared the monumental task ahead. He just nodded and said, “Tea’s mashed. What’s first?”

First was not a spanner or a wrench. First was the laptop. Kath sat down in the cold office, the signed contract laid on the desk beside her like a sacred text, and opened a new spreadsheet. The twenty-page proposal had been an act of creative fiction; this was the grim, non-fiction translation. Mark Henderson had promised to email the full list of his fifty vans, and true to his word, the email was waiting. Kath began to build her new bible, a master document with fifty rows, one for each vehicle. She created columns for registration numbers, chassis numbers, engine types, MOT due dates, service intervals, and tyre specifications. It was slow, unglamorous, repetitive work. It involved none of the intuitive, visceral satisfaction of diagnosing a faulty engine by sound. But as the grid filled up, a sense of control, real and earned, began to settle over her. She was no longer just reacting. She was planning. She was managing a fleet.

Her next task was to solidify the most audacious of her lies. She took the cheap burner phone and, in a clear, steady voice, recorded a new voicemail message. “You’ve reached the Henderson Fleet Support line from Price’s Garage. All our technicians are currently engaged. Please leave your vehicle registration, your location, and a brief description of the issue, and we will return your call within five minutes.” She played it back. It sounded impossibly professional. It sounded real. She then took the old, cracked noticeboard from the wall, the one stained with tea rings and covered in faded takeaway menus, and threw it into the skip. In its place, she mounted the clean whiteboard. With a ruler and a black marker, she drew a neat, permanent grid. Across the top, she wrote the days of the week. Down the side, she wrote the registration numbers of the first five vans scheduled for their ‘onboarding’. The lies were being erased, replaced by systems.

The new engine for the broken-down Transit arrived on Monday morning, a gargantuan, plastic-wrapped cube on a wooden pallet, lowered from the back of a lorry with a hydraulic lift. It sat in the middle of the workshop floor, an object of immense potential and terrifying expense. Liam walked around it, his expression a mixture of awe and professional curiosity. “Ford wanted to send their own tech to fit it,” he said, looking at Kath. “Told them not to bother. Told them we were handling the installation in-house to guarantee quality control.” Kath felt a smile touch her lips. He was learning faster than she could teach. She thought of Henderson’s parting advice, his casual vote of confidence in her imaginary system. It was time to earn it. “Good,” she said. “Because we are. You and me. I want you to lead on this, Liam. I’ll handle the mechanicals, the heavy lifting. You’re on the diagnostics, the electronics, the integration with the ECU. This is your baby.” The trust she placed in him was a tangible thing. Liam looked from the engine to her, his shoulders straightening almost imperceptibly. He wasn't just helping anymore. He was responsible.

The job became their sole focus for the next two days. It was a different kind of work from the brutal, greasy transplant on the tow truck. This was modern, complex, and unforgiving. Kath, in her element with the physical task, directed the precise, careful operation of lowering the new engine into the Transit’s pristine engine bay. But once it was seated on its mounts, she stepped back. This was Liam’s territory. With the new diagnostic tablet in hand, he began the painstaking process of connecting the engine’s nervous system to the van’s central brain. He worked with a quiet, intense focus, muttering to himself, cross-referencing schematics on the tablet, his fingers, once clumsy and uncertain, now moving with a new, deft confidence. Kath watched him, handing him tools before he asked for them, acting as his assistant. The hierarchy had inverted. She was no longer just the boss; she was part of a team, and she was discovering, to her surprise, that she liked it.

On Tuesday evening, they were done. The last connection was made, the last fluid level checked. The moment of truth had arrived. Kath stood back, leaning against a workbench, and nodded at Liam. “Your baby,” she said. “You turn the key.” Liam slid into the driver’s seat, his face pale under the fluorescent lights. He took a deep breath and turned the key. The starter motor spun for a second, and then the engine caught, settling instantly into a low, perfect, factory-fresh hum. There were no rattles, no warning lights on the dashboard, no hint of trouble. It was perfect. A huge, shared sigh of relief seemed to leave their bodies at the same time. Liam looked at Kath, a grin of pure, exhausted triumph spreading across his face. “Good work, lead technician,” Kath said, and the grin on her own face felt real and unforced. It was a victory untainted by a single lie. They had done the work. They had earned it.

That night, after Liam had gone home, Kath didn’t leave straight away. She stood in the doorway of the office, looking out at her garage. The broken Transit was now a whole, healthy vehicle, purring quietly as it ran a final systems check. The tow truck stood ready in the yard, a silent, powerful guardian. The whiteboard on the wall was filled with her own neat, forward-looking plans. This was no longer her dad’s garage, filled with the ghosts of his habits and his disappointments. It was hers. The foundations, paid for with grief and built with bluff, were now solid, and she was beginning to build upon them. She walked to the desk and picked up the small plastic figure of Dr. Alistair Finch. For weeks, he had been her tutor, her oracle, her desperate, last-ditch confessor. She looked at his calm, unchanging, academic face. The dynamic had changed. She no longer needed him to teach her. She just needed him to bear witness. She walked over to a newly cleared shelf above the office window, a shelf with a panoramic view of the entire workshop floor. She placed him there, next to his tiny astrolabe, a silent chairman of the board, presiding over the business he had, in his own strange way, helped to build from the ashes. He was a reminder of the madness, but now, he was also a symbol of the method. The future was still a vast, terrifying unknown, but for the first time, Kath Price felt ready to meet it.
