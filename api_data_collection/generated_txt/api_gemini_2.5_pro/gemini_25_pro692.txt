The silence in the house was thick as old gravy, broken only by the frantic buzz of a bluebottle fly battering itself against a windowpane in the hallway. Koos van der Merwe knelt, sweat beading on his brow and trickling down the valley of his spine, leaving a damp trail on his blue work shirt. The smell of ozone and burnt plastic hung in the air, a familiar perfume of his trade. He stared into the guts of the distribution board, a tangled mess of red, black, and green wires that looked like a nest of mechanical snakes. Mrs. Henderson, the homeowner, a woman whose face was a roadmap of disapproving wrinkles, hovered just out of sight, her presence a weight on the humid air. He could hear the soft, rhythmic clinking of her teaspoon against a porcelain cup. Weak tea, he’d bet his best set of pliers. She’d offered him some an hour ago, and the pale, watery liquid she’d called ‘rooibos’ was an insult to the very leaf.

“Is it a big problem, Mr. van der Merwe?” Her voice, thin and reedy, cut through the quiet.

“Just a trip, Mrs. Henderson. Bit of an overload,” Koos grunted, not looking up. He reached for a length of green earth wire, his calloused fingers working with a deftness that belied their size. His hands were tools in themselves, scarred with nicks and old burns, the nails permanently rimmed with a grime that no amount of scrubbing could fully conquer. This was his life: fixing the things other people broke or simply wore out. He was a creature of circuits and currents, a man who understood the flow of invisible power but often felt powerless in the flow of his own existence. The job was fine. It paid the bills. It kept his bakkie, a dusty but loyal Ford Ranger, filled with petrol. But the joy? The joy was not in the wires.

He tightened the final screw, the metal groaning in protest. With a satisfying clunk, he flipped the main switch. The lights in the hallway flickered on, banishing the shadows. The bluebottle, momentarily stunned by the change, ceased its kamikaze run. “There we go, mevrou. All sorted.”

He stood up, his knees cracking a protest. He was forty-six, an age where standing up was becoming a noticeable event. He packed his tools into the worn leather bag, the metallic scrape and clatter a familiar closing symphony to his work. Mrs. Henderson produced a handful of notes from the pocket of her floral apron, her lips pursed as if parting with the money was a minor surgical procedure.

“Thank you, Mr. van der Merwe. I do hope it doesn’t happen again.”

“Should be fine now. Just don’t run the kettle, the microwave, and the pool pump all at the same time, ja?” He gave her a tired smile that didn’t reach his eyes. She wouldn’t listen. They never did. He’d be back in six months to replace a melted plug socket.

The sun hit him like a physical blow as he stepped outside. The Highveld heat was a merciless, baking force that bleached the colour from the sky and made the jacaranda trees droop in submission. He squinted, the world a shimmering glare, and made his way to the bakkie parked at the curb. The cab was an oven. He threw his toolbox onto the passenger seat, the worn vinyl sighing under the weight. He cranked the windows down, the handles stiff and reluctant, and started the engine. The diesel engine rumbled to life with a comforting, agricultural cough. For a moment, he just sat there, the hot air washing over him, the smell of petrol and sun-baked dust filling his nostrils. Another day, another faulty board. The profound, grinding sameness of it all settled on his shoulders.

He pulled his phone from his pocket, the screen a spiderweb of fine cracks. He scrolled past a missed call from his sister and a payment reminder from the municipality. Junk, junk, a message from Fanie with a rude meme. Then he saw it. An email with the subject line: “Golden Flaky Crust National Pie-Eating Final - Confirmation”.

His heart gave a strange, powerful lurch, a jolt stronger than any faulty earth leakage he’d ever encountered. His thumb, thick and clumsy, trembled as he tapped to open it. The logo appeared first: a cartoon pie with a crown, winking. Then the words, stark and beautiful in a plain, corporate font.

“Dear Mr. Jacobus van der Merwe,

We are delighted to inform you that following your triumphant performance at the Gauteng regional qualifiers (14 steak and kidney pies in 10 minutes), you have been selected as one of the twelve finalists for the 2023 Golden Flaky Crust National Pie-Eating Championship!…”

Koos stopped reading. The rest was just details – date, time, venue in Sandton, Johannesburg. The important part had detonated in his chest. A finalist. He was a finalist. The words echoed in the silent, hot cab of his bakkie. He, Koos van der Merwe, electrician from Bloemfontein, a man whose greatest public recognition to date was getting his name in the local paper for fixing the church’s floodlights for free, was a national finalist. A slow grin spread across his face, a real one this time, a wide, wonderful thing that crinkled the corners of his eyes and made him look ten years younger. The dusty suburban street suddenly seemed alive with possibility. The shimmering heat wasn’t oppressive anymore; it was a golden haze. The droning of the cicadas became a celebratory orchestra.

He didn’t drive home. His body, acting on an instinct deeper than thought, steered the bakkie towards the Mimosa Mall. He parked in his usual spot and walked, almost floated, towards his sanctuary, his training ground, his temple: “Tannie Sannie se Pasteie.” The smell hit him twenty paces away – a glorious, holy trinity of baked pastry, rich gravy, and roasting meat. It was the smell of victory.

Inside, the air was cool and thick with the scent of paradise. Tannie Sannie herself, a woman built along the generous lines of a dough-proofer, stood behind the counter, her face flushed from the heat of the ovens. Pies of every description were lined up behind the glass, their golden, burnished crusts gleaming under the fluorescent lights. Pepper steak, chicken and mushroom, sausage roll, Cornish pasty, steak and kidney. They weren't just pies to Koos. They were individuals, each with its own character, its own structural integrity, its own unique challenge.

“Koos, my boy! You look like the cat that got the cream, and the canary,” Sannie boomed, her voice as warm as her ovens.

“Better, Tannie. Much better.” He leaned against the counter, his grin still fixed in place. “Give me the usual. A pepper steak. And make it a hot one.”

She retrieved a pie from the warmer with a set of tongs, its pastry puffed and proud, and slid it into a small paper bag. The warmth seeped through the paper into his palm. He handed her a twenty-rand note and told her to keep the change. This was no ordinary pie. This was a sacrament. He didn't eat it there. He took it back to the bakkie, observing the proper ritual. He sat in the driver’s seat, the little bag resting on his lap like a sacred text. He opened it carefully, peeling back the paper. Steam, rich with the promise of black pepper and slow-cooked beef, ghosted upwards. He took the first bite.

The crust shattered with an audible crackle, a perfect, laminated explosion. It was flaky, buttery, and substantial enough to hold its own. Then came the filling: tender chunks of beef swimming in a thick, dark gravy that was aggressively, beautifully peppery. It was hot enough to scald the roof of his mouth, but he didn't care. The pain was part of the pleasure. This was everything a pie should be. It was honest. It was uncomplicated. It was delicious. In a world of tripped circuits and disapproving clients, the pie was a constant. The pie was true. He closed his eyes, chewing slowly, savouring the textures and the flavours. He wasn’t just an electrician. He was a connoisseur. An athlete. A champion in waiting.

He finished the pie in four bites, licking the last of the gravy from his fingers. He had to tell Fanie. Fanie would laugh, he’d call him a madman, but he would understand. Or at least he’d pretend to. Koos started the bakkie and pointed it towards the industrial area, towards the big, blue-and-orange sign of the Midas where Fanie spent his days selling fan belts and spark plugs.

The workshop was a cathedral of organised chaos. Shelves towered to the ceiling, laden with oil filters, brake pads, and air fresheners shaped like pine trees. The air smelled of rubber, cheap coffee, and grease. Fanie was leaning over a counter, explaining the difference between two types of windscreen wipers to a bewildered-looking student. He was a wiry man with a perpetual look of cynical amusement on his face. He saw Koos and his eyes lit up.

“Don’t tell me,” Fanie said, finishing with his customer. “Old Mrs. Henderson’s house burn down finally?”

“Nah, just the usual. Listen.” Koos’s voice was low, conspiratorial. He couldn’t stop smiling. “I got it. The email.”

Fanie’s eyebrows shot up. “No ways. The pie thing? The big one?”

“The final, Fanie! The national final! In Jo’burg! I’m in!”

Fanie let out a low whistle, a genuine, impressed sound. He wiped a greasy hand on his overalls and stared at his friend. “Jirre, Koos. You actually did it. You mad bastard. All those weekends of practice, sitting there with your stopwatch and a dozen pies from Tannie Sannie’s.” He shook his head, a smile playing on his lips. “I never thought… I mean, I thought you were just getting fat.”

“It’s strategic weight,” Koos said, puffing out his chest. “Stomach conditioning. You wouldn’t understand the science.”

“The science of being a human dustbin?” Fanie laughed, a loud, barking sound that echoed through the shop. “So, what’s the prize? A lifetime supply of heartburn?”

“Two hundred thousand rand, Fanie. And the Golden Crust trophy. It’s a pie. On a marble stand. A golden pie.” Koos said the words with a reverence usually reserved for prayer. Two hundred thousand rand. He could pay off the bakkie. He could replace his tools. He could even take a proper holiday, somewhere with a beach where the only current he had to worry about was the tide. But it wasn't about the money, not really. It was about the trophy. The Golden Pie. It was about being the best at something. He could already see it on his mantelpiece, gleaming next to the framed photo of his late father. His father had been a great man for a braai, a true master of the tongs and fire, but this… this was different. This was a national title.

“Two hundred grand?” Fanie’s cynicism evaporated, replaced by a look of naked awe. “To eat pies? Bliksem, Koos. Maybe I should’ve taken up your sport instead of trying to fix these bleddie cars.” He clapped Koos hard on the shoulder, leaving a greasy handprint on his shirt. “We have to celebrate. A few beers at the Spur tonight. My treat.”

“I can’t,” Koos said, his face suddenly serious. “Training. My body is a temple now, Fanie. I have to respect the temple. From now on, it’s a strict regimen. Stomach-stretching exercises in the morning, capacity drills in the evening. And I need to get the bakkie looked at.”

“The bakkie? What’s wrong with it?”

“Nothing, not really. But it’s a long drive to Jo’burg. I can’t risk it. It has to be perfect. Everything has to be perfect.” Koos looked past Fanie, his eyes distant, already seeing the highway stretching out before him, the glittering skyline of Johannesburg on the horizon. He saw a stage, bright lights, a table laden with pies. He saw himself, victorious, raising a golden trophy to the roar of a crowd. It was more than a daydream. It felt like a premonition. It felt like destiny.The next morning, Koos woke before his alarm. It was a strange sensation. Usually, the shrill beep of his phone was a summons to a day he had to endure, but today, a quiet excitement hummed in his veins, a low-voltage current of pure purpose. The first pale light of dawn was seeping through the curtains of his small bedroom in his flat in Willows. Instead of his usual routine – a resigned stumble to the coffee machine – he moved with a deliberate, focused energy. He was no longer just Koos the electrician. He was Koos the athlete. And athletes had regimens.

He went to the kitchen and ignored the coffee. Instead, he took a two-litre plastic jug from the cupboard, filled it to the brim with tap water, and placed it on the countertop. He set the timer on his cracked phone for five minutes. This was part of his research, gleaned from late-night internet forums dedicated to the esoteric art of competitive eating. ‘Stomach Elasticity Training’, they called it. He took a deep breath, picked up the jug, and began to drink. It was not pleasant. The first litre went down relatively easily, but the second was a battle of will against biology. His stomach protested, bloating uncomfortably. He felt a wave of nausea, but he pushed through it, his eyes watering, his focus narrowed to the ticking numbers on his phone screen. He finished with thirty seconds to spare, slumping over the sink, panting. The temple felt more like a water-logged shed, but this was the price of greatness.

The workday was a strange, disconnected affair. At a house in Dan Pienaar, while replacing a faulty geyser element, he found his mind wandering. The coiled, grey heating element looked like a petrified sausage roll. The flow of water through the pipes became a metaphor for the efficient delivery of gravy to the mouth. He worked on autopilot, his hands performing the familiar dance of stripping wires and tightening nuts, but his spirit was elsewhere, in a mental arena filled with the scent of baked goods. He barely registered the homeowner’s chatter about her son’s rugby trials. He wanted to tell her, ‘My sport is purer. It has no offside rule, only the glorious, honest truth of the pie.’ But he just nodded, grunted, and finished the job.

As the sun began its descent, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, he did not head for home. The bakkie, as if possessing a will of its own, turned once again towards the Mimosa Mall. At Tannie Sannie se Pasteie, the evening rush was in full swing, but Sannie saw him and gave a conspiratorial wink. He’d called her that morning to explain the situation, and she had embraced her new role as head coach and chief supplier with patriotic fervour. She had a table set for him in the corner, away from the main flow of customers. On it sat not one, but six pepper steak pies and a fresh jug of water.

“Capacity drill, my boy,” she announced, her voice a low rumble. “I’ve used the standard-grade pastry. A little less flaky, a little more chew. Good for building jaw strength. The filling is regulation weight. Not my best gravy, mind you. A little blander. Don’t want you getting distracted by the pleasure.”

Koos looked at the row of pies. They were his opponents. He laid out his tools: a stopwatch, a napkin, and his unwavering resolve. He nodded at Sannie, a silent signal. She clicked a pen and held it poised over a small notebook. “Ready… Go!” she barked. The first pie vanished in a storm of efficient, powerful bites. He had a system: a ‘Roman-style’ bite to break the structural integrity of the crust, followed by two ‘sweeper’ bites to clear the filling, and a final ‘polishing’ bite for the remaining fragments. Crust, filling, crust, filling. He didn’t taste it, not really. This wasn’t eating; it was demolition. He washed it down with precise sips of water, just enough to clear the palate and lubricate the throat. One pie down in fifty-eight seconds. A new personal best. He moved to the next, a relentless, gravy-fuelled machine. Sweat beaded on his forehead. His jaw began to ache. After the fourth pie, he hit the wall. The flavour, previously ignored, turned against him, a monotonous, peppery sludge. His stomach, still feeling the morning’s water-loading, sent messages of urgent protest.

“Come on, Koos!” Sannie’s voice cut through his haze of discomfort. “Think of that golden trophy! Think of the glory! Think of putting Bloemfontein on the map for something other than cheetahs and potholes!” Her words were a jolt of pure, high-voltage motivation. He closed his eyes, pictured the glistening, golden prize, and attacked the fifth pie. He finished all six in nine minutes and forty-two seconds. He slumped back in his chair, breathing heavily, a warrior surveying a field of paper-bag carnage. Sannie patted his back, her hand like a warm spade. “Good work, champ. Very good work. We’ll get you to twelve in no time.”

Later that evening, greasy handprints and all, he pulled the bakkie into the cavernous mouth of the Midas workshop. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting long shadows between the steel shelves. Fanie was closing up, wiping down his counter with a rag that had seen better decades. He looked up as Koos entered, a half-eaten samoosa in his hand.

“Training go well?” Fanie asked, a crumb-dusted smirk on his face. “You look a bit green around the gills. Did Tannie Sannie’s pies finally fight back?”

“Conditioning,” Koos corrected him, patting his stomach which felt tight as a drum. “I’m here about the bakkie. My noble steed. She needs to be in peak condition for the pilgrimage to Jo’burg. I want you to go over everything. Plugs, oil, filters, the works. Check the tyres. Check the brakes. She can’t fail me, Fanie. Not now.”

Fanie circled the old Ford Ranger, his eyes narrowed in professional assessment. He kicked one of the tyres, then ran a hand along a dent in the fender that had been there since Koos had misjudged a pole outside a hardware store three years ago. “She’s a tough old girl, Koos. But ja, a full service is a good idea. The N1 is no place for a breakdown. I’ll make her purr like a kitten. A big, smoky, diesel kitten. It’ll cost you, though.”

“I’ll pay you,” Koos said earnestly.

Fanie laughed, shaking his head. “Nah, forget it. Consider it a sponsorship. ‘Fanie’s Midas: Official Mechanical Partner to the Koos van der Merwe Pie-Eating Express’. Just bring me back a piece of that trophy. Or at least a pie from the competition.” He clapped Koos on the shoulder again, a gesture of true, uncomplicated friendship that felt as solid as the engine block of the bakkie. “You’re really doing this, hey? You’re all in.”

“All in, Fanie,” Koos confirmed, his voice quiet but firm. “One hundred percent.”

When he finally got home, the flat felt quiet and empty. The smell of old plumbing and dust seemed more noticeable than usual. He saw the missed call from his sister, Elna, again. He knew he couldn’t put it off. He showered, scrubbing the scent of pepper steak and diesel from his skin, and dialled her number. She picked up on the second ring.

“Koos! Finally. I was starting to think you’d electrocuted yourself,” her voice was brisk, practical, with the slight edge of an older sister’s permanent concern.

“Hello, Elna. Nah, just busy. Work, you know.”

“Right. Listen, about Ma’s birthday next month, we need to decide on a gift…”

“Ja, okay,” Koos interrupted, knowing he had to just get it over with. “But listen, I have some news.” He took a breath. “You know that pie competition thing I was doing?”

“The what? Oh, that silly thing. You’re not still doing that, are you? Koos, your cholesterol…”

“I made the finals, Elna. The national finals. In Johannesburg. The prize is two hundred thousand rand.”

There was a long silence on the other end of the line. He could picture her perfectly: standing in her pristine kitchen in Cape Town, her phone pressed to her ear, her brow furrowed in a mixture of confusion and disbelief. “Pies, Koos? You’re going to a national final for… eating pies?”

“It’s a legitimate sport,” he said, a little defensively. “Competitive eating.”

“It’s a heart attack on a plate, is what it is. Two hundred thousand rand? Are you serious?” The skepticism in her voice was thick enough to be a gravy of its own. “Koos, be sensible. What are you going to do, quit your job to become a professional pie-eater? It’s a phase. Like that time you wanted to be a DJ. Remember ‘DJ Koos-tic’?”

The old nickname stung, but he held his ground. “This is different. I’m good at this, Elna. Really good.”

“You’re good at fixing things,” she countered, her tone softening slightly. “You have a trade. A good, honest job. This… this is just silly. Please just be careful.”

They talked for a few more minutes about their mother, the weather, the usual things, but the conversation was strained. When he hung up, a familiar sense of deflation settled over him. This was the world outside of Fanie’s workshop and Tannie Sannie’s bakery. A world that didn’t understand. He walked into his small living room and looked at the photo on the mantelpiece. It was of his dad, twenty years younger, standing proudly next to a massive Weber braai, tongs in one hand, a beer in the other, a massive grin on his face. His dad had appreciated simple, well-made things. He’d appreciated a man who was the best at his craft, whatever that craft might be. Koos looked from the photo to his own reflection in the dark television screen. Elna thought it was silly. Mrs. Henderson thought he was just the help. But his dad? His dad, he thought, would have understood the pursuit of a golden-crusted glory. He might have even asked for a bite. The thought solidified something in Koos’s heart. He wasn't just doing it for himself. He was doing it for them all.The days leading up to the final took on a new, relentless rhythm. Koos’s life, once a predictable loop of faulty wiring and lukewarm tea, was now governed by the unforgiving logic of a training schedule pinned to his fridge door. The water-loading became a grim morning ritual. The capacity drills at Tannie Sannie’s became evening ordeals, the table in the corner a battlefield strewn with the paper-bag casualties of war. Sannie, now fully invested, had procured a batch of extra-tough biltong for what she called ‘mandibular fortification’. Koos would sit in his bakkie during his lunch break, not eating, but chewing methodically on a leathery stick of dried meat until his jaw ached with a deep, grinding fire. His colleagues at the electrical supply wholesaler, where he picked up his materials, started giving him strange looks as he performed discreet jaw-stretching exercises while waiting for his invoice.

Fanie, true to his word, had adopted the Ford Ranger with the solemnity of a surgeon preparing for a heart transplant. The bakkie spent two full days on the hydraulic lift at Midas, its underbelly exposed to Fanie’s meticulous attention. He flushed the radiator, replaced every filter, and rotated the tyres with the care of a croupier shuffling cards. Koos visited one afternoon to find him hunched over the engine bay, a small LED light clenched in his teeth, humming along to the radio. He’d polished the dashboard until it shone and hung a new air freshener from the rearview mirror. It wasn’t a pine tree or a vanilla pod, but a custom-laminated photo of a Tannie Sannie pepper steak pie.

“Gotta keep your eyes on the prize, my friend,” Fanie had said, wiping his hands on his overalls and revealing a fresh smear of grease. “And I tuned the engine. She’s got a bit more oomph now. For overtaking. You can’t be late for destiny, ja?” The simple, unwavering belief in Fanie’s eyes was more nourishing than any pie. It was the current that kept his own motivation from tripping. When Koos finally got the bakkie back, it felt different. The engine didn’t cough to life anymore; it awoke with a smooth, confident rumble. The steering felt tighter. It was no longer just a workhorse; it was a chariot, polished and primed for a hero’s journey.

News of Koos’s quest began to ripple through the quiet ponds of Bloemfontein. A slow news day led a junior reporter from the *Volksblad* to Tannie Sannie’s, and a short, slightly mocking article appeared in the local interest section, complete with a picture of Koos looking uncomfortable, holding a pie like it was a baby animal he was unsure what to do with. The headline read: “Bloemfontein Electrician Has Big Appetite for Glory”. Suddenly, he wasn’t anonymous anymore. At the butchery, ou Piet slapped him on the back and offered him a free piece of droëwors for ‘the cause’. A group of students at the Spur, where he’d gone with Fanie for a celebratory soda water, insisted on buying his drink and chanted “Koos! Koos! Koos!” until he turned a shade of crimson that matched the restaurant’s branding. But for every supporter, there was a sceptic. “Heard you’re entering an eating contest, Van der Merwe,” sneered Mr. Botha, a man for whom Koos had recently installed a new pool pump. “Should be easy for you. I’ve seen the way you tuck into a garage pie at lunchtime.” Koos just smiled his tired smile, the one that didn’t reach his eyes, and thought of the Golden Crust trophy. The mockery was just noise. The trophy was the signal.

The biggest challenge, however, came not from the training or the naysayers, but from the internet. One evening, after a gruelling session involving seven slightly-stale chicken and mushroom pies, Koos fell down the rabbit hole of competitive eating forums. He found grainy footage of the previous year’s championship. He watched, mesmerised and horrified, as the reigning champion, a man from Durban named Sizwe “The Juggernaut” Jabavu, dispatched twelve pies with the cool, terrifying efficiency of a woodchipper. Jabavu was lean and focused, with a predatory stillness between bites. He didn’t seem to enjoy it; he simply consumed, his eyes fixed on some middle distance, his movements economical and brutal. Then there was “The Cape Cobra,” a wiry winemaker from Paarl who seemed to unhinge his jaw, his whole body writhing as he swallowed. There were others, a gallery of gastronomic gladiators, each with their own technique, their own legend. For the first time, a cold sliver of doubt pierced Koos’s confidence. These were not amateurs. They were professionals. He was just an electrician from Bloemfontein who happened to be good at eating pies. A wave of nausea, unrelated to the seven pies sloshing in his stomach, washed over him.

The feeling festered. Two nights before he was due to leave for Johannesburg, the phone rang after ten. It was an emergency call-out. The main breaker at a small 24-hour convenience store had tripped, plunging the shop into darkness and threatening to spoil a freezer full of ice cream. Koos almost said no. It was late, he was tired, and his body was supposed to be a temple, not a workhorse. But the ingrained habit of a lifetime, the instinct to fix what was broken, was too strong. He grabbed his worn leather bag, the familiar weight of his tools a comfort in his hands, and drove the purring bakkie through the sleeping city.

The shop smelled of stale coffee, floor cleaner, and the faint, sweet aroma of melting raspberry ripple. The owner, a young Indian man named Rohan, was frantic. Koos knelt before the distribution board, the nest of wires a familiar sight in the beam of his headlamp. He clipped his multimeter to the terminals, his mind quieting as it focused on the familiar problem. It wasn’t an overload; it was a short, somewhere on the lighting circuit. He worked methodically, tracing the fault, his calloused fingers moving with the sureness of long practice. He found the culprit in under twenty minutes: a wire whose insulation had been chewed through by a rat, earthing against the metal conduit. It was a simple fix. He cut the damaged section, spliced in a new piece, and wrapped it securely. He flipped the breaker. The lights flickered on, the fridges hummed back to life, and Rohan’s face flooded with relief.

“You’re a lifesaver, man, a real lifesaver!” Rohan gushed, pressing two hundred-rand notes into Koos’s hand. Driving home, the simple satisfaction of the job settled over him. He had brought light to the darkness. He had restored order. It was a tangible, honest skill. Elna’s voice echoed in his head: *You have a trade. A good, honest job. This… this is just silly.* He looked at his hands on the steering wheel, the hands that understood circuits and currents, rimmed with the grime of honest work. Was he a fool? Trading this certainty for the absurd, fleeting glory of a pie-eating contest? The doubt was no longer a sliver, but a heavy weight in his gut, more potent than any undigested pastry. He was Koos van der Merwe, electrician. It said so on his invoices. It was who he was. This other thing, this ‘champion in waiting’, felt like a costume he was wearing, and he was starting to forget what he looked like underneath. The road ahead, leading to Johannesburg, suddenly seemed impossibly long and fraught with ridicule.The morning of his departure, the doubt was a physical presence in his small flat, as palpable as the lingering smell of the previous night’s emergency call-out. It sat on his shoulders as he packed the bakkie, a cooler box filled with water jugs and chewing biltong on one side, his faithful leather toolbag on the other. The two objects seemed to represent the warring factions of his identity: the steady, reliable tradesman versus the absurd, aspiring champion. He stood for a long moment in the cool dawn air, the keys to the bakkie feeling unnaturally heavy in his palm. It would be so easy to unpack the cooler box, drive to his first job of the day, and let the dream of the Golden Pie fade like a forgotten tune. It would be the sensible thing to do. It was what Elna would expect.

Instead, he drove to Midas. The workshop was just opening, the large blue roller door groaning its way upwards to reveal Fanie, already in his grease-stained overalls, sipping a steaming mug of coffee. He saw the loaded bakkie and his face split into a wide grin. He didn't ask if Koos was having second thoughts. He didn't need to. He simply walked over and gave the bakkie’s bonnet a proprietary pat.

“She’s ready for the great trek, my champion,” Fanie declared. He peered into the cab and nodded approvingly at the pie-shaped air freshener dangling from the mirror. “Remember the plan. Stay in the slow lane, keep the revs steady. She’s not a racehorse, she’s a marathon runner. Just like you.” He handed Koos a plastic bag containing a handful of dried apricots and another tough stick of biltong. “Road snacks. Low volume, high energy. And listen,” Fanie’s voice dropped, his usual cynical humour gone, replaced by a raw sincerity that caught Koos off guard. “Don’t listen to the clever people who think this is a joke. Being the best at something, anything, is never a joke. Now get out of here before you’re late.”

The N1 highway stretched north out of Bloemfontein, a black ribbon laid across the immense, khaki-coloured canvas of the Free State. The initial hours of the drive were a meditation. The bakkie hummed along, a low, contented thrum that vibrated up through the seat. Fanie had worked magic. The old Ford felt solid, reliable, a willing partner in the quest. Outside, the world was vast and empty, dotted with flat-topped koppies and the occasional wind-battered farmhouse. Koos drove with a quiet focus, the landscape scrolling past, the heavy weight of his doubt slowly beginning to dissolve in the sheer scale of the sky above him. He thought of his father, who used to say that a long drive could solve most of a man's problems. It didn’t solve them, Koos realised, but it gave you enough space to see them properly. The ridicule, the self-consciousness, his sister’s well-meaning scorn—out here, under this endless sky, they seemed small and distant. All that felt real was the rumble of the engine and the road ahead.

As he crossed the Vaal River, the world changed. The open spaces of the Free State gave way to the sprawling, congested beast of Gauteng. The traffic thickened, becoming a frantic, aggressive dance of taxis, trucks, and sleek German sedans. Billboards screamed from the side of the road, promising wealth, beauty, and faster internet. The air grew thick with a hazy cocktail of exhaust fumes and industry. This was Johannesburg, a city that didn't care for quiet contemplation. It demanded your full attention. Koos felt a surge of adrenaline, his knuckles whitening on the steering wheel. He was no longer on a meditative journey; he was navigating enemy territory. The city was a monument to power and success, and he felt like an intruder in his dusty bakkie, a country mouse arriving for a city banquet he hadn’t been properly invited to.

Sandton was another level of alien altogether. Gleaming towers of glass and steel clawed at the sky, reflecting the harsh afternoon sun. The streets were a parade of luxury cars driven by people who looked like they’d never had a spot of grime under their fingernails in their lives. He felt a thousand miles and a million rand away from Mrs. Henderson’s faulty distribution board. He found the hotel, a chic, minimalist palace of chrome and white marble, and parked the bakkie between a Porsche Cayenne and a Range Rover. He felt a blush of shame for his vehicle's dents and dust, then a surge of defiance. The bakkie had honest scars. It had earned its place here as much as they had. He slung his duffel bag over his shoulder, left his toolbox where it was, and walked into the refrigerated air of the lobby, feeling as out of place as a spanner in a jewellery box.

The check-in process was smooth and impersonal. A young woman with a flawless smile and a name badge that read ‘Candice’ handed him his key card and a glossy welcome pack. The logo of the winking pie with a crown seemed to mock him from the cover. “The orientation for all Championship contenders is at six p.m. in the Gold Reef suite, Mr. van der Merwe. Good luck.” She said it with the same polite disinterest she probably used to give directions to the bathroom. He was just another guest, another item to be processed. He walked towards the lifts, the welcome pack clutched in his hand, a tangible, terrifying confirmation that this was real.

As he waited for the lift, the doors slid open and a man stepped out. He was tall and lean, dressed in expensive-looking athletic gear, with headphones around his neck. He moved with a coiled, predatory grace that was instantly familiar. It was him. Sizwe “The Juggernaut” Jabavu. He looked even more intimidating in person. He wasn’t big or fat; he looked like a long-distance runner, his body honed for ruthless efficiency. He was carrying a bottle filled with a bright green, sludgy liquid. Sizwe’s eyes, dark and intelligent, flickered over Koos for a bare second. It wasn't a hostile look, but it was an assessment. He saw the cheap jeans, the work shirt, the slightly bewildered expression of a man who didn’t belong. He gave a curt, almost imperceptible nod, a professional acknowledgment of a fellow competitor, then turned and strode silently across the marble floor, disappearing out the glass doors. Koos felt his heart sink. The man drank green sludge. He looked like he could digest steel. Koos’s training regimen of pepper steak and biltong suddenly felt hopelessly, laughably amateur.

His hotel room was on the seventeenth floor. It was larger than his entire living room, with a bed that looked big enough to land a small aircraft on and a window that offered a breathtaking, terrifying panorama of the city sprawling to the horizon. The air was sterile, chilled by the silent hum of the air conditioner. He felt utterly alone, a tiny, insignificant speck in the vast, glittering metropolis. He dropped his bag on the floor and walked to the window, pressing his forehead against the cool glass. The scale of it all, the city, the hotel, the competition, The Juggernaut, threatened to swallow him whole. He was a fool. An electrician from Bloem who had mistaken a party trick for a talent. He closed his eyes, the familiar wave of nausea and doubt cresting within him. But then, he thought of Fanie’s greasy, triumphant grin. He thought of Tannie Sannie, timing him with her pen poised like a conductor's baton. He thought of his dad, proud master of the braai. He opened his eyes, pulled the welcome pack from its glossy folder, and laid the contents on the polished desk. There was a schedule, a list of rules, and a stylised diagram of the pie they would be eating: a ‘Golden Flaky Crust Official Championship Steak and Kidney Pie, 220 grams’. It was just a pie. He knew pies. He understood their construction, their weaknesses, their structural integrity. He might not belong in this fancy hotel, and he might not drink green sludge, but he knew the truth of a pie. The fear hadn't vanished, but it now had a focus. He wasn’t here to admire the view. He was here to work.At six o’clock sharp, Koos took the lift down to the Gold Reef suite. He had changed, not into anything fancy, but into a fresh blue work shirt, the one he saved for quoting new clients. It was clean and smelled of sunlight and cheap washing powder. It felt like a uniform, a familiar skin in this alien environment. The act of putting it on was a small rebellion against the sterile luxury of the hotel, a reminder of who he was. An electrician. A man who worked with his hands.

The suite was a symphony in beige and muted gold, dominated by a large, polished mahogany table arranged in a U-shape. At the head of the room was a lectern and a projector screen displaying the winking pie logo. Branded notepads and pens were laid out at each of the twelve place settings, along with bottles of still water whose labels probably cost more than the water inside. The air was thick with a tense, unnatural quiet and the competing scents of expensive cologne and nervous sweat. He was one of the last to arrive. He scanned the faces around the table, a rogues' gallery of his competition, and felt his stomach clench. Sizwe “The Juggernaut” Jabavu was there, sitting perfectly still, his eyes closed, a picture of meditative focus. He hadn't touched his notepad or his water. A few seats down, a wiry, sun-weathered man with a frantic energy was doing subtle stretching exercises with his neck and jaw; the Cape Cobra, just as the forums had described. A hulking man in a faded Springbok jersey was loudly telling a story to a younger, pale-faced competitor who looked like he was about to be sick.

Koos spotted an empty chair at the very end of the U, as far from the centre of attention as possible, and slid into it. He felt like a schoolboy who had wandered into a university lecture by mistake. He placed his calloused hands on the polished table, his grimy fingernails a stark contrast to the pristine setting, and kept his eyes down, studying the intricate grain of the wood. This was a world of strategy and performance, of personal brands and psychological warfare. He just wanted to eat some pies.

A man in a slim-fitting suit that was a little too tight at the shoulders strode to the lectern. He had a blindingly white smile and hair that was sculpted into a state of permanent surprise. "Good evening, athletes, and welcome!" he chirped, his voice radiating a synthetic, high-energy enthusiasm. "My name is Brendan, and on behalf of the entire Golden Flaky Crust family, I want to congratulate you on making it to the grand finale!" Koos flinched at the word ‘athletes’. Brendan launched into a slick, pre-packaged speech about the proud heritage of the Golden Flaky Crust brand, the passion baked into every product, and the spirit of sportsmanship. Koos’s attention drifted. This was the same kind of empty talk he heard from suppliers trying to sell him overpriced circuit breakers. It had no substance, no weight.

Brendan clicked a remote, and the screen behind him changed to a slide titled ‘Rules of Engagement’. The jovial tone in his voice sharpened slightly. “Now, for the nitty-gritty. The competition will last exactly ten minutes. The winner is the individual who consumes the most Official Championship Steak and Kidney Pies in that time. A pie is only considered consumed if it is fully, and I do mean *fully*, cleared from its foil tray. Water is the only beverage permitted. No dunking of pies into the water is allowed—this is a purist’s competition, ladies and gentlemen.” Brendan paused for effect, his eyes sweeping the room. “And finally, the most important rule. We have a zero-tolerance policy for what is known in the sport as a ‘reversal’. Any competitor who suffers a reversal, at any point during or immediately after the competition, will be instantly disqualified. Are we clear?” The room was silent. The word ‘reversal’ hung in the air, a polite, clinical term for a very primal, undignified act. Koos felt a sympathetic churn in his own stomach, which was still recovering from the week's training.

Then came the main event of the orientation. A side door opened and a woman in a tall chef’s hat and immaculate whites walked in, carrying a single pie on a silver platter as if it were the crown jewels. She placed it reverently in the centre of the table. The "Hero Pie". It was visually perfect. Its crust was a uniform, deep golden brown, with a crimped edge so precise it could only have been made by a machine. Brendan gestured to it with a flourish. "Behold, your battlefield! Two hundred and twenty grams of prime South African beef and kidney, in a rich, traditional gravy, encased in our patented thirty-two-layer laminated butter pastry." The other contestants leaned forward, their eyes fixed on the pie with varying degrees of hunger, calculation, and dread. But Koos saw something different. He wasn't looking at it as food. He was looking at it as a piece of engineering. It was a structure, and he was a man who understood structures. The machine-crimped edge was too tight, too rigid. It would be brittle. The glaze was flawless, yes, but that meant it was a fine, sealing layer. The single steam vent in the centre was too small. This told him everything. The crust would trap a huge amount of steam, turning the filling into a pocket of molten-hot gravy. Amateurs would bite into the top and scald their mouths, losing precious seconds. The rigid edge meant the base would likely be slightly undercooked and claggy where it met the foil. He saw its flaws. He saw its weaknesses. And in that moment, he saw his strategy.

The doubt that had been his constant companion since leaving Bloemfontein finally, blessedly, fell silent. He wasn't an imposter. He was an expert. This was just another system to be diagnosed and mastered, a faulty circuit to be understood and bypassed. He might not have the physique of The Juggernaut or the swagger of the man in the Springbok jersey, but he had his hands and his head. He understood pressure, and heat, and structural integrity. A slow, genuine grin touched his lips for the first time since he’d arrived in Johannesburg. He looked up from the pie and his eyes met Sizwe Jabavu's across the table. The Juggernaut's eyes were open now, and he too was studying the pie, not as a meal, but as a problem. He saw Koos’s grin and the flicker of understanding in his eyes. For a brief second, the mask of meditative calm slipped, and Sizwe gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. It wasn't a challenge or a threat. It was a salute. From one professional, acknowledging another. Koos nodded back. The room, the city, the two-hundred-thousand-rand prize—it all faded away. All that was left was the work ahead.The day of the championship dawned not with a jolt of anxiety, but with a profound and unusual calm. Koos woke in the vast, empty bed before the sun had fully illuminated the city skyline, his mind clear and quiet. The seventeen-story drop outside his window no longer felt like a terrifying void but simply a view. The doubt was gone, replaced by a quiet sense of purpose. He was a man with a job to do. There were no last-minute water-loading sessions, no frantic jaw-stretches. He showered, the hot water sluicing away the last vestiges of sleep, and got dressed in the same blue work shirt he’d worn to the orientation. It felt right. It felt like him. He sat in the armchair by the window, the city waking up below him, and drank a single glass of room-temperature water, slowly and deliberately. He didn't think about the two hundred thousand rand or the Golden Pie trophy. He thought about heat transfer, structural weaknesses, and pressure points. He thought about the machine-crimped edge and the inadequate steam vent. He was mentally stripping the wires on the problem, preparing to make the right connection.

His phone buzzed on the bedside table. It was Fanie. Koos answered, and his ear was immediately assaulted by a cacophony of shouting and clanging metal. "KOOS! CAN YOU HEAR ME? IT'S FANIE!" Fanie yelled, his voice distorted by the speakerphone he was clearly using. "The whole workshop is here! We’ve got the radio on, they’re doing live updates! Ou Piet from the butchery just dropped off a tray of biltong for the boys! Are you ready? Are you focused?" Koos could hear someone in the background shout, “Tell him to think of Tannie Sannie’s gravy!” A smile, real and relaxed, spread across Koos’s face. “I’m focused, Fanie,” he said, his voice steady. “Good. Good!” Fanie boomed. “Now you listen to me. Forget all those other ouens. You’re not there to race them. You’re there to do a job. You see a problem, and you fix it. That’s what you do. Just fix the pies, Koos. One after the other. Ja?” The advice was so simple, so Fanie, that it resonated in Koos’s soul like a perfectly struck tuning fork. “Ja, Fanie,” he said. “I’ll fix them.”

The competition was being held in the central atrium of the Sandton City shopping mall. When Koos arrived, the scene was a jarring assault on the senses. The cavernous space, usually filled with the gentle murmur of commerce, was a riot of noise and light. A massive stage had been erected beneath the glass dome of the roof, flanked by towering stacks of speakers pumping out upbeat, generic rock music. Giant screens showed slow-motion footage of pies being cut open, gravy cascading in stylised waves. A crowd of several hundred people, a mixture of curious shoppers and dedicated fans, was pressed against velvet ropes, their phones held aloft. Brendan, the MC, was already on stage, whipping the crowd into a frenzy with the manic energy of a game show host. Koos, clutching his small duffel bag and wearing his blue work shirt, felt utterly anonymous as he was directed by a harried-looking production assistant towards a roped-off area behind the stage.

This ‘green room’ was a small, tense pocket of reality amidst the manufactured spectacle. It was a hastily assembled space with a few chairs, a table laden with bottled water, and the overwhelming, almost suffocating smell of hot pastry and simmering anxiety. The twelve finalists were gathered, each dealing with the pressure in their own way. The hulking man in the Springbok jersey was pacing back and forth, muttering to himself like a caged bear. The Cape Cobra, pale and sweating, sat hunched in a chair, his leg bouncing uncontrollably. Sizwe “The Juggernaut” Jabavu stood in a corner, perfectly still, his back to the room, performing a series of slow, controlled breathing exercises. He was a study in coiled potential. Koos found an empty spot against a temporary partition, set his bag down, and took out his old, wire-rimmed reading glasses. He wouldn't need them for the competition, but the familiar, methodical act of cleaning the lenses with a corner of his shirt was grounding. He polished the glass, held them up to the light, found an imaginary smudge, and polished them again. He was not one of them, not a showman or a psychological warrior. He was a tradesman, and this was his final, quiet moment of preparation before the job began.

“Alright, athletes, it’s showtime!” Brendan burst into the room, clapping his hands together. “Let’s get you out there! Remember, big smiles, lots of energy! The crowd loves energy!” He began calling them out one by one, sending them through the curtain onto the stage to a burst of music and applause. The introductions were bombastic and absurd. “He’s a wine-making wizard with a voracious velocity! Give it up for THE CAPE COBRA!” A roar from the crowd. “The reigning, defending, undisputed champion! He doesn’t eat pies, he dismantles them! SIZWE ‘THE JUGGERNAUT’ JABAVU!” The loudest roar of all. Finally, it was Koos’s turn. “And our final competitor, coming all the way from Bloemfontein! He can handle a high-voltage current and a high-volume crust! Put your hands together for Koos… ‘THE SPARKY’ VAN DER MERWE!” The music that accompanied him was an old, cheesy rock anthem about working for the weekend. The applause was scattered, more curious than enthusiastic. Koos walked out into the blinding glare of the spotlights, his eyes not on the cheering crowd or the flashing cameras, but on the long table on the stage. He saw his station, number seven, and walked towards it with the steady, unhurried gait of a man who was simply arriving to do a day’s work. He gave a short, stiff wave, feeling the heat of the lights on his face, and took his seat.

The stage was set. Twelve identical stations, each with a stack of napkins, a large plastic cup, and a jug of water. The chairs felt high and exposed, like thrones for a very strange kingdom. A small army of officials in chef’s hats and Golden Flaky Crust aprons began to march out from behind the stage, carrying large warming trays. With militaristic precision, they placed the first tranche of pies in front of each competitor – a row of twelve, each in its own foil tray. A wave of heat and the rich, almost dizzying aroma of steak and kidney washed over the table. The pies were exactly as he’d seen at the orientation: machine-perfect, golden-brown, and deceptively innocent. Koos ignored the sensory overload. He ignored the man on his left, who was cracking his knuckles, and the man on his right, who was whispering a prayer. He focused on the single pie directly in front of him.

Brendan’s voice echoed through the atrium, silencing the crowd. “Contestants, you have ten minutes. The person who consumes the most pies, with no reversals, will be crowned our 2023 Golden Flaky Crust National Champion and walk away with two hundred thousand rand!” A camera on a long boom arm swept over their faces, projecting their tense expressions onto the giant screens. Koos kept his gaze fixed downwards. Brendan began the final countdown, his voice booming like a prophecy. “TEN! NINE! EIGHT!...” Koos placed his hands on either side of his first pie. His fingers, calloused and sure, felt the warmth of the foil. He tuned out the noise, the lights, the sheer madness of it all. His world contracted to a small circle of hot pastry. "...THREE!... TWO!... ONE!" A piercing siren blared across the atrium, the official signal to begin. In that instant, as eleven other men lunged for their pies, Koos van der Merwe did not take a bite. Instead, with a calm, deliberate movement, he flipped his first pie upside down onto the table.The siren’s echo was still ringing in the vast atrium when Koos performed his manoeuvre. For a full second, which stretched into an eternity under the blazing stage lights, nothing happened. The other eleven competitors attacked their pies with a primal fury, a flurry of hands and gaping mouths. The sound was a wet, frantic symphony of chewing and tearing. But at station number seven, there was only a strange, deliberate silence. Koos’s action was so contrary to the explosive start that it created a pocket of pure confusion. A collective gasp rippled through the front rows of the crowd. On the giant screens, the camera operator, caught off guard, zoomed in on the upside-down pie, a golden-brown dome resting forlornly on the pristine white tabletop.

Brendan, the MC, momentarily lost his plastic smile. His brain, primed for a commentary of speed and gluttony, stalled. “Well, folks,” he stammered into the microphone, trying to recover, “it seems… it seems our electrician from Bloemfontein is, uh… inspecting the wiring from the other side?” A smattering of confused laughter came from the audience. Across the table, the hulking man in the Springbok jersey, already halfway through his first pie with gravy smeared across his cheek, shot Koos a look of utter contempt, as if this bizarre ritual was an insult to the sport itself. He was showing off. A rookie mistake.

But Koos wasn’t showing off. He was working. With the pie inverted, he didn’t need to breach the tough, glazed top crust. He ignored it completely. Instead, he took his thumb and forefinger—the same digits that could delicately twist a terminal screw—and applied firm, targeted pressure to the centre of the pale, soft base. It yielded instantly with a satisfying squish, not a brittle crackle. The gravy, having pooled at what was now the top of the pie, was significantly cooler than the super-heated steam trapped beneath the thick lid of pastry. It oozed out benignly, a manageable, lukewarm slurry of beef and kidney. He didn’t need to take a massive, jaw-straining bite. He simply crushed the base, scooped the contents into his mouth with two efficient movements, and then dispatched the now-empty shell of the top crust in a final, perfunctory bite. While other competitors were still blowing on molten chunks of meat and fanning their scalded mouths, losing precious seconds to pain and caution, Koos cleared his first foil tray. Forty-eight seconds. It wasn’t a blistering pace, but it was clean, it was painless, and it was repeatable. He calmly reached for his second pie and, without hesitation, flipped it upside down.

He fell into a rhythm, a trance of pure process. Flip, crush, scoop, clear. Flip, crush, scoop, clear. He wasn’t eating; he was dismantling a series of identical, faulty appliances. The noise of the crowd, the thumping music, Brendan’s increasingly bewildered commentary—it all faded into a distant hum. His world was the three feet of table space in front of him. The motion became automatic, a piece of muscle memory drilled into him not by Tannie Sannie’s training sessions, but by twenty-five years of methodical, repetitive work. It was the same rhythm as replacing a row of burnt-out sockets in a factory, or wiring a new distribution board. One component at a time, in the correct order, with no wasted movement. He used the water sparingly, not to wash down huge mouthfuls, but as a small, precise sip between pies to cleanse the palate and prepare the way for the next.

By the three-minute mark, the initial mockery had died down. On the giant screens, a split-screen display showed the running tally. Sizwe ‘The Juggernaut’ Jabavu was in the lead, a terrifying machine of consumption. He had devoured five pies, his face a mask of ferocious concentration, his technique a blur of controlled violence. The Cape Cobra was close behind with four, though his station was a warzone of dropped filling and shredded napkins. But then there was the anomaly. At station seven, Koos van der Merwe, the quiet electrician, had also finished four pies. He wasn't as fast as Sizwe, but he had lost no time to the heat. His station was unnervingly clean. He was keeping pace with the legends of the sport using a technique that defied all conventional wisdom.

“I don’t believe what I’m seeing, folks!” Brendan’s voice had regained its energy, now tinged with genuine astonishment. “While the Juggernaut is using brute force, Koos van der Merwe is using… brain force! He’s completely bypassed the heat problem! He’s attacking the pie’s weak point! He’s weaponised the base! It’s… it’s the Van der Merwe Inversion!” The name stuck. A murmur went through the crowd, a wave of appreciation for the underdog, for the sheer, unexpected genius of the move. The scattered, curious applause for ‘The Sparky’ began to coalesce into a genuine roar of support. They were witnessing the birth of a legend.

At the five-minute halfway point, the toll of the conventional method was beginning to show on the other competitors. The man in the Springbok jersey had slowed dramatically, his face flushed and beaded with sweat, the aggressive pace replaced by a weary, determined slog. The Cape Cobra, having hit a wall of flavour fatigue, took a long, desperate gulp of water, a cardinal sin that wasted time and filled valuable stomach capacity. But Koos’s pace remained utterly constant. Flip, crush, scoop, clear. He had just polished off his sixth pie and was reaching for his seventh, his movements as economical as they had been for his first. He was now tied for second place. Only Sizwe Jabavu was ahead of him, having just started on his eighth pie. For the first time, Sizwe paused. It was a fractional hesitation, barely perceptible, but it was there. He cast a sideways glance down the table towards station seven. He saw the neat stack of empty foil trays. He saw the inverted pie in Koos’s hands. He saw the method. His eyes, dark and intense, widened slightly. It wasn’t anger or disbelief. It was the stark, cold recognition of a master craftsman seeing a brilliant, unorthodox tool for the very first time. He gave a single, sharp nod, an acknowledgment of the battle he was now truly in, and returned to his work, his pace somehow finding another gear.

The final three minutes were a duel. The crowd, now fully behind the man in the blue work shirt, began to chant his name. “KOOS! KOOS! KOOS!” The sound washed over him, but he didn't register it as encouragement. It was just more noise, another variable in the system to be ignored. He finished his eighth pie, then his ninth. He was in the zone, a place of pure, unthinking action. The rich flavour of the steak and kidney had long since faded into a monotonous, textural input. There was only the process. He reached for his tenth pie, his movements still precise, while all around him, competitors were succumbing to the inevitable. Two seats down, a young man groaned and pushed his chair back, his race finished. At the far end, the hulking Springbok fan leaned heavily on the table, his head in his hands, defeated. It was a field of carnage. Only two men were still operating at peak performance.

The giant screens showed the impossible: KOOS: 10. SIZWE: 11. One minute remaining. The roar of the crowd was deafening. Brendan was screaming into the microphone, his voice hoarse. “This is unbelievable! The unknown from Bloemfontein is going bite for bite with the champion! Can he do it? Can the Sparky shock the world?” Koos flipped his eleventh pie. His hands were slick with grease, but his grip was sure. Crush. Scoop. His jaw ached with a deep, profound fire, a protest from muscles pushed far beyond their intended limits. He felt a wave of nausea, a warning signal from a stomach stretched to its absolute breaking point. He swallowed hard, pushing it down through sheer force of will. He thought of Fanie’s greasy grin and the purring engine of the bakkie. He cleared the pie. He was tied with the Juggernaut. Eleven pies each.

Thirty seconds left. He reached for his twelfth pie. At the same moment, Sizwe reached for his. Their eyes met for a fleeting second across the debris-strewn stage. There was no animosity, only a shared, profound respect for the extremity of their situation. The final sprint was a study in contrasts. Sizwe was a blur of motion, tearing into his pie with a final, desperate burst of athletic power. Koos was a study in grim determination, his movements fractionally slower but just as relentless. Flip. Crush. The crowd was on its feet, a single, roaring entity. The countdown began, shouted by a thousand voices. “TEN! NINE! EIGHT!” Koos forced a mouthful of gravy and meat down his throat. His body was screaming at him to stop. “SEVEN! SIX! FIVE!” He scooped up the last of the filling. Only the crust remained. Sizwe had already finished, his hands raised in triumph. “FOUR! THREE! TWO!” Koos brought the final piece of crust to his lips.

The siren shrieked, a brutal, final sound that cut through the roar of the crowd. Koos’s hands, halfway to his mouth, froze. He had done it. He had finished the twelfth pie. But had his final swallow cleared his mouth before the siren? He wasn’t sure. The rules were absolute. The stage fell into a sudden, ringing silence, the echoes of the siren and the crowd fading into a tense, expectant hush. Exhausted, Koos slumped in his chair, his head bowed, the greasy, half-eaten piece of crust still clutched in his trembling fingers. He looked at the carnage on his table: twelve immaculate, empty foil trays stacked in a neat, orderly pile. It was good work. It was a finished job. Whatever happened next, he had fixed the problem.The silence in the shopping mall was a physical thing, a heavy blanket that smothered the echoes of the final siren. Thousands of eyes were fixed on the stage, on the two men at the centre of the drama. Sizwe Jabavu stood with his arms raised, a posture of victory that seemed, in the stark quiet, more questioning than triumphant. And then there was Koos, slumped in his chair, a statue of exhaustion, his gaze fixed on the small, greasy piece of pastry clutched in his hand. It was the last fragment of his twelfth pie, a crescent of golden crust that represented the razor-thin margin between glory and disqualification.

Brendan, the MC, rushed to the centre of the stage, his face a mask of manufactured drama. "Ladies and gentlemen, what a finish! What a photo finish! The judges are convening. This is the closest final in Golden Flaky Crust history!" He gestured towards a group of officials in white jackets who were huddled around a monitor, replaying the final seconds in forensic slow motion. The giant screens above the stage flickered, and the crowd let out a collective gasp as they saw the replay. There was Sizwe, clean and decisive, his station clear, his hands empty a full two seconds before the siren. Then the camera angle switched to Koos. His hand, holding the final piece, was moving towards his mouth in what felt like agonisingly slow motion. The siren blared, its sound wave visibly jarring the camera, and his hand froze, a mere inch from his lips. A groan of disappointment rippled through the crowd. The rule was clear: *fully consumed*. A man in the front row, wearing a "Juggernaut" t-shirt, pumped his fist. A woman near him, who had been chanting Koos’s name, buried her face in her hands.

Koos didn't watch the replay. He didn't need to. He knew. He had felt the vibration of the siren through the floor of the stage. He slowly uncurled his fingers and placed the uneaten piece of crust on the table beside his neat stack of twelve empty foil trays. It was a tiny monument to a near-miss. He felt a strange sense of peace. He had given it everything. He had emptied twelve trays, a feat he hadn't even achieved in his most ambitious training sessions with Tannie Sannie. He had met the champion’s pace. He had developed a new technique under pressure. He had done the work, and he had done it well. The prize money, the trophy… they felt secondary to the simple, profound satisfaction of a job well done. He felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up. It was Sizwe Jabavu.

The champion’s face was unreadable. The ferocious mask of concentration he had worn throughout the contest was gone, replaced by a look of weary, analytical calm. He looked from Koos’s face, down to the uneaten piece of crust, and then to the neat stack of twelve empty foil trays. He nodded slowly, his eyes missing nothing. He didn’t say a word. He simply placed his hand on Koos’s shoulder for a moment, a gesture of solidarity that spoke louder than any words, and then walked back to his station to await the verdict.

The head judge, a stern man with a magnificent grey moustache, detached himself from the huddle and walked stiffly to the lectern. Brendan bounded over, holding a microphone out with the reverence of a religious offering. The judge cleared his throat, the sound echoing in the cavernous space. "After careful review of the video evidence," he began, his voice formal and devoid of emotion, "the judges have reached a decision. In accordance with Rule 4b of the official championship guidelines, a pie is only deemed 'consumed' when it has been entirely cleared from the mouth and swallowed." He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. "At the final siren, competitor Sizwe Jabavu had successfully consumed twelve pies." He was drowned out by a roar of applause from Sizwe's supporters, but the champion himself remained perfectly still, his expression unchanged. The judge held up a hand for silence. "Competitor Koos van der Merwe had successfully consumed eleven pies." A collective groan of disappointment swept through the mall. "While Mr. van der Merwe had successfully cleared his twelfth foil tray, the final fragment had not been swallowed prior to the siren. Therefore, his official final count is eleven."

The decision was clinical, brutal, and final. Koos felt a pang of disappointment, not for himself, but for Fanie and Tannie Sannie and the whole workshop back in Bloemfontein who were listening on the radio. He had let them down. He prepared to stand up, to shake the winner’s hand and retreat back into the anonymity from which he had so unexpectedly emerged. But just as Brendan began to declare Sizwe the sole winner, Sizwe himself stepped forward, took the microphone from the MC’s stunned hand, and addressed the judge.

"With all due respect, sir," Sizwe’s voice was quiet, yet it carried an authority that commanded absolute attention. The entire mall fell silent once more. "The rules are the rules, and I respect the letter of the law. But today, I did not compete against eleven men. I competed against one." He turned and looked directly at Koos, a look of profound, professional respect in his eyes. "For five years, I have won this title. In all that time, no one has ever pushed me this hard. No one has ever made me fear I would lose." He turned back to the crowd. "And no one, in the entire history of this sport, has ever shown the genius to turn the pie upside down." A wave of laughter and applause broke the tension. Sizwe let it die down before continuing. "This man did not simply eat. He thought. He engineered. He found a new way. He equalled my final count, not by luck, but by brilliance. My twelfth pie crossed the line two seconds before his. His twelfth pie crossed the line one second after. The difference is a technicality. It is not a victory." He paused, and his next words stunned everyone into silence. "I cannot accept a championship won by one second, against a man who changed the game in ten minutes. I request that we be declared co-champions."

The head judge stared, speechless. Brendan’s jaw hung open. A ripple of disbelief, followed by a groundswell of pure, unadulterated admiration, washed over the crowd. This was sportsmanship of the highest order. This was class. The chant started slowly at first, then built into an undeniable roar: "KOOS! SIZWE! KOOS! SIZWE!" The judge, a man of rules and regulations, looked at the sea of cheering faces, then at the man in the tight suit from Golden Flaky Crust corporate, who was frantically nodding his head, his eyes gleaming with the recognition of a perfect, priceless PR moment. The judge sighed, the magnificent moustache drooping slightly, and tapped the microphone. "In light of this... unprecedented act of sportsmanship, and consulting with the sponsors... the judges have amended their decision. We have two champions!"

The explosion of noise was immense. Koos, who had been listening to Sizwe's speech in a state of stunned disbelief, felt himself being pulled to his feet. Sizwe grabbed his arm and raised it in the air alongside his own. The flashes of cameras were a blinding, strobing wall of light. They were presented with a single, giant cheque for two hundred thousand rand, and they held it together, Koos’s grimy, calloused hand next to Sizwe’s lean, athletic one. They brought out the Golden Crust trophy, the gleaming, gold-plated pie on its marble stand. Sizwe took it, and without hesitation, handed it to Koos. “You have it for the first year,” he said, his voice low enough that only Koos could hear over the din. “You earned the right to show them what you did. I'll get it next year.”

Koos stood there, dazed, holding the surprisingly heavy trophy. It felt solid, real, and absurd. He looked out at the blur of faces, the flashing lights, the sheer madness of it all, and then he looked at the man beside him. The Juggernaut. His rival. His co-champion. A man who understood that true victory wasn't just about being the best, but about honouring the craft.

Later, after the whirlwind of interviews where Koos mostly just nodded and mumbled “Ja, I’m very happy” while Sizwe handled the reporters with practiced ease, he found himself back in the sterile silence of his hotel room. He placed the Golden Pie trophy on the polished desk, where it looked surreal against the minimalist decor. The giant cheque was propped against the window, the number ‘R200,000’ looking like a misprint. He was physically and emotionally exhausted, his stomach a confused, churning mess, his jaw aching with a pain so deep it felt structural. He sank into the armchair, the city lights of Johannesburg glittering outside like a field of scattered diamonds.

He pulled his phone from his pocket, the screen still a spiderweb of cracks. There were dozens of missed calls and messages. He scrolled to the top and pressed the first one. It was Fanie. The phone was immediately answered by a deafening roar of celebration from the Midas workshop. "HE DID IT! HE DID IT! KOOSIE, YOU BEAUTY! YOU MAD BASTARD, YOU DID IT!" Fanie’s voice was hoarse with emotion. Koos could hear Tannie Sannie in the background, yelling something about naming a pie after him. He just listened, a slow smile spreading across his face, the noise from Bloemfontein a warm, comforting wave that washed away the glitz and strangeness of Sandton.

After he finally managed to hang up, promising to call again when he was on the road, he scrolled down his call list. He passed the messages from the local paper, from distant cousins he hadn’t heard from in years. He stopped at a missed call from an hour ago. Elna. His sister. He took a deep breath, the air conditioning humming its quiet, indifferent song. He looked at the golden trophy gleaming on the desk, then at his own reflection in the dark window—a tired man in a blue work shirt, a long way from home. He pressed the button. The phone began to ring. He wasn't sure what he would say, or what she would say. He just knew that this time, when she asked what he’d been up to, he would have an answer.The phone rang for a small eternity before Elna picked up, her voice a sharp, worried query. “Koos? Is everything alright? What’s happened?”

“Hello, Elna. Everything’s fine. I’m fine,” he said, his own voice sounding distant and tired in his ears.

“Fine? Koos, my phone has been buzzing for the last hour. My neighbour, Mrs. Gable, just forwarded me a news article with your face on it. It says… it says you won some kind of eating competition? Is this a joke?” The skepticism was still there, a familiar baseline to their conversations, but it was threaded with a new note of frantic confusion. She sounded less like a disapproving older sister and more like someone trying to make sense of a physics-defying phenomenon.

“Co-champion,” Koos corrected her softly, leaning his head back against the armchair. “Me and another ou. Sizwe Jabavu. He’s the champion from the last few years.” He didn’t mention the details of the finish or the act of sportsmanship; it felt too complicated to explain. He just gave her the fact.

There was a pause, a brief moment of static and silence on the line. He could hear the faint sound of her kettle whistling in the background in her pristine Cape Town kitchen. “The article said the prize was two hundred thousand rand.” She said the number as if it were a foreign word she was tasting for the first time. The mockery was entirely gone from her voice, replaced by a tone of pure, unadulterated shock.

“Ja. We split it,” Koos confirmed. “One hundred thousand each.”

Another, longer silence. He could picture her perfectly, leaning against her granite countertop, her brow furrowed, trying to reconcile the image of her grease-stained, slightly hapless younger brother with the absurdly large number she had just heard. The silly hobby, the thing she’d compared to his teenage DJ phase, had just produced more money than he made in three months of honest, back-breaking work. “One hundred thousand rand,” she repeated, her voice barely a whisper. “For… pies.” The sentence hung in the air between them, a bridge between her world of sense and sensibility and his world of golden-crusted glory. Then her tone shifted, becoming brisk and practical again, but the underlying judgment had vanished. “Well. My goodness. You need to be careful with that, Koos. You should talk to a financial advisor. Don’t just go and spend it all on the bakkie.” There was another short pause, and then, so quietly he almost missed it, she added, “And… be careful driving home. And Koos… well done.”

He woke the next morning to a symphony of aches. His jaw felt like it had been used as a clamp, a deep, resonant pain that radiated up into his temples. His stomach was a landscape of profound regret, a bloated, tender region that churned with the memory of twelve steak and kidney pies. The thought of food, any food, was repulsive. He rolled over in the giant, unfamiliar bed and his eyes fell on the Golden Pie trophy sitting on the desk. In the sharp morning light, it looked both magnificent and utterly ridiculous, a monument to a brilliant, painful, and glorious act of madness. He pushed himself out of bed, his knees cracking their usual protest, and walked over to it. He reached out and touched the cool, smooth metal of the pie. It was real. He had done that. He looked at his reflection in the polished marble of the stand—the same tired, 46-year-old face, the same web of lines around his eyes. But something was different. The exhaustion in his eyes was his own, earned in an arena of his choosing. It was the satisfying ache of a job pushed to its absolute limit, not the weary grind of another day endured.

Checking out of the hotel was a surreal experience. The same front desk clerk, Candice, who had greeted him with polite indifference two days earlier, now beamed at him with genuine warmth. “Congratulations, Mr. van der Merwe! We all watched it on the screens in the bar. It was incredible!” she gushed. As he walked across the marble lobby, carrying his duffel bag in one hand and the carefully wrapped trophy in the other, he felt a few people turn to look. A man in a business suit gave him a thumbs-up. He was no longer an intruder in his blue work shirt; he was a co-champion, a minor celebrity in a story that was, for a fleeting moment, the talk of the town. He reached the bakkie, parked proudly between its gleaming, expensive neighbours. He opened the passenger door, and with the care of a father handling a newborn, he placed the trophy on the worn vinyl seat. He took a spare work shirt from his bag, wrapped it gently around the golden prize, and then clicked the seatbelt firmly into place across its marble base. It was the most precious cargo his bakkie had ever carried.

The N1 highway leading south was a different road to the one he had travelled up. The endless, flat expanse of the Highveld no longer felt like a void, but like an opening, a welcoming space. The sun, which had been a merciless, baking force, now seemed to cast a warm, golden glow over the landscape, matching the prize buckled in beside him. He drove with the windows down, the agricultural smell of the platteland filling the cab, a familiar perfume that washed away the last of Sandton’s sterile, air-conditioned scent. He glanced occasionally at the swaddled shape on the passenger seat, a constant, tangible reminder of the impossible thing he had accomplished. The hundred thousand rand felt like a bonus, an abstract number in a bank account. He would pay off the bakkie. He would buy a new top-of-the-range multimeter, the one he’d been dreaming about for years. He might even take that holiday his sister was always nagging him about. But the real prize was sitting next to him, a heavy, gleaming symbol that he was more than just the man who fixed things. He was the man who had found a new way to fix things, on a national stage.

He didn’t drive straight home to his empty flat. As the outskirts of Bloemfontein came into view, the bakkie, as if on autopilot, took the exit towards the industrial area. He pulled into the familiar, oil-stained yard of the Midas. Before he could even turn the engine off, the big roller door flew open and a cheer went up. Fanie, Ou Piet from the butchery, and a half-dozen other mechanics and regulars poured out into the sunshine, their faces split with triumphant grins. Fanie yanked open the passenger door, saw the buckled-in trophy, and let out a bellow of pure joy. “He buckled her in! Bliksem, Koos, you’re a national treasure!” They crowded around, clapping him on the back, shaking his hand, their congratulations a chaotic, heartfelt roar. Fanie carefully unbuckled the trophy and lifted it out, holding it aloft like a World Cup. The greasy, reverent hands of his friends passed it from one to the next, each man weighing its heft, marvelling at its shine, a piece of their friend’s impossible victory made real.

His second stop was his temple. He carried the trophy himself into the cool, fragrant air of Tannie Sannie se Pasteie. The lunch rush was over, and Sannie was wiping down her counter, her movements slow and tired. She looked up as he entered, and her broad, kind face seemed to crumple and reassemble itself into a smile of pure, unadulterated pride. Tears welled in her eyes as she came around the counter, enveloping him in a hug that smelled of baked flour, warm gravy, and honest affection. "I knew it," she whispered into his shoulder, her voice thick with emotion. "I knew you had it in you, my boy." She let him go and pointed to the front glass window of her shop. There, taped to the inside, was a piece of cardboard on which she had written in thick, black koki pen: “HOME OF THE PEPPER STEAK PIE AND THE 2023 NATIONAL PIE EATING CO-CHAMPION!!” For the second time in twenty-four hours, Koos felt a lump form in his throat that had nothing to do with pie crust.

That evening, back in the familiar quiet of his flat, he cleared a space on the mantelpiece. He pushed aside a stack of unpaid bills and a small, dusty carving of a giraffe. Then, with great care, he placed the Golden Pie trophy in the centre of the shelf, right next to the framed photograph of his father, grinning proudly beside his Weber braai. The light from the single floor lamp caught the polished gold, casting a warm glow that connected the two images. The master of the fire and the master of the pie. A father and a son, both champions of their own domain. Koos stood back, his hands on his hips, a deep, bone-weary satisfaction settling over him. It was the same feeling he got after restoring power to an entire building, the satisfying clunk of the main switch, the banishment of darkness. It was the feeling of a job well and truly done. Tomorrow morning, at eight o’clock, he had a call-out in Fichardt Park to fix a faulty geyser. And for the first time in a very long time, he found himself looking forward to it. The joy, he realised, had always been in the wires. He just needed to find it everywhere else to finally see it.The eight o’clock alarm was, for the first time in recent memory, an unwelcome intrusion. Not because it heralded a day of work he wished to avoid, but because it broke the profound, bone-deep peace of a truly restful sleep. The aches were still there, a chorus of protest from his jaw and stomach, but they were distant, like the memory of a storm that had passed. He got up, moved through his morning routine with a quiet deliberation, and pulled on a clean work shirt. Before he left, he stood for a moment in the living room, looking at the Golden Pie on the mantelpiece. It seemed to have settled into the space, its ridiculousness tempered by the morning light, looking less like a gaudy prize and more like a strange, glittering family heirloom. He grabbed his worn leather toolbag, the familiar weight a comfort in his hand, and headed out into the day.

The job was in Fichardt Park, a quiet suburb of face-brick houses and well-tended lawns. He parked the bakkie outside a neat home with a garden gnome fishing in a dry birdbath. The homeowner, a man named Mr. du Plessis with a kind, round face and spectacles perched on the end of his nose, opened the door. His eyes widened in recognition. “Bliksem,” he breathed, a look of pure astonishment on his face. “It is you. I told my wife it was you. The pie man! The hero of Bloemfontein!” Koos felt a familiar blush creep up his neck. “I’m here about the geyser, Meneer,” he mumbled, hoping to steer the conversation back to the comfortable territory of plumbing and electricity. “Ja, ja, of course! Come in, come in! The wife’s gone out, she’ll be furious she missed you. She was cheering so loud last night I thought the neighbours would call the police!” Mr. du Plessis led him through the house, chattering excitedly about the ‘Van der Merwe Inversion’ and how he’d tried it with a samoosa at work that morning with disastrous results.

Koos knelt before the geyser in the narrow hallway cupboard, the smell of dust and warm metal a welcome antidote to the glare of the previous day’s spotlights. He opened his toolbag, the familiar scrape and clatter of his tools settling his nerves. This, he knew. This was his world. He clipped his old, reliable multimeter to the terminals of the thermostat. The needle didn’t move. A dead thermostat. A simple fix, a thirty-minute job. As he worked, his hands moving with an ingrained, fluid economy, Mr. du Plessis hovered nearby, providing a running commentary. “So, that other fellow, the Juggernaut, he looked like a real machine! But you, you were clever! That’s the Bloemfontein way, ja? We work clever, not hard!” Koos just grunted in response, tightening a screw. He finished the job, flipped the breaker on the main board, and listened for the gentle hum of the element heating up. Order restored. Light, or at least hot water, brought back from the brink. It was a good feeling, solid and true.

“Right, all sorted, Mr. du Plessis,” Koos said, standing up and packing his tools. He started writing out the invoice, his hand still aching slightly. “No, no, put that away for a moment,” the man said, rushing off to the kitchen. He returned not with a handful of notes, but with a frosty beer in one hand and a copy of the day’s *Volksblad* in the other. The front page was dominated by a picture of him and Sizwe, holding the trophy, their expressions a mixture of exhaustion and triumph. “First,” Mr. du Plessis said, handing him the beer, “a proper drink for a champion. Not that weak tea you get from some people, hey? And second…” He opened the newspaper and held it out with a pen. “Would you mind?” Koos stared at the request, then at his own face on the front page. Koos ‘The Sparky’ van der Merwe. He took the pen, his clumsy, grease-stained fingers feeling strange around its delicate barrel, and carefully signed his name across the bottom of the photo. It was the first autograph he had ever given.

His next stop was the bank. Walking into the cool, marble-floored hall holding a giant novelty cheque felt even more absurd than signing the newspaper. He bypassed the queue and went to the enquiries desk, feeling the curious stares of everyone in the bank. The young woman at the desk looked at the cheque, then at him, and her professional composure evaporated into a star-struck grin. She called the branch manager, a stern-looking woman in a navy-blue suit, who emerged from her office, saw the cheque, and broke into a wide smile, shaking his hand firmly. The whole process of depositing the R100,000 felt like an out-of-body experience. It was an impossible, abstract number, a string of zeroes that didn’t feel real until the teller handed him the deposit slip. He stared at the new balance in his account, a number larger than he had ever seen there before. It didn't bring a surge of excitement, but a quiet, profound sense of relief. It was a buffer. It was safety. It was the price of a thousand faulty geysers, earned in ten minutes of glorious, painful madness.

With the deposit slip tucked securely in his shirt pocket, he didn’t go to the next job. He drove instead to the city’s best electrical supply wholesaler, a vast warehouse that smelled of ozone, cardboard, and rubber. He walked past the aisles of cheap extension cords and bulk-buy lightbulbs, heading straight for the glass counter at the back where they kept the high-end diagnostic equipment. There it was, hanging in a pristine, hard-shell case. The Fluke 87V Industrial Multimeter. It was the Rolls-Royce of multimeters, a tool of breathtaking precision and durability that he had coveted for years, but could never justify the expense. “Can I help you, Koos?” asked the salesman, a young man named Deon. “Heard you had a big weekend up in Jozi, hey! That was some move with the pie!” Koos nodded, his eyes fixed on the multimeter. “I’ll take that one,” he said, pointing. Deon whistled. “The 87V? Going big time, I see!” As Deon processed the sale, Koos opened the case. He lifted the tool out. It was heavier than his old one, its bright yellow rubber holster fitting perfectly in his hand. The digital display was large and clear, the selection dial moving with a satisfying, solid click. This was not a trophy. This was a tool. It was the physical embodiment of his craft, the best possible instrument for the work he knew and loved. He paid for it in cash, the crisp new notes from the bank feeling far more real when exchanged for something so solid, so useful.

He sat in the bakkie for a long time afterwards, the new multimeter in its case on the passenger seat, right where the trophy had been. He opened the case again, just to look at it. The Golden Pie was for show, for the story. This was for the work. And in that moment, sitting in the dusty cab of his paid-off bakkie, a new state-of-the-art tool at his side, Koos van der Merwe felt a contentment so deep and quiet it was almost silent. The frantic buzz of the bluebottle fly was gone. The silence in the house was no longer thick as gravy. It was just quiet. And it was peaceful.The next morning, Koos didn't linger. He drove the bakkie, its engine purring with a newfound smoothness, straight to the Midas workshop. Fanie’s kingdom was in full swing, the air thick with the smell of rubber and hot metal, the rhythmic clang of a hammer on steel providing a percussive beat. Koos walked in, holding a thick envelope. Fanie was halfway under the bonnet of a battered Toyota, his wiry frame twisted at an improbable angle. He emerged, wiping a streak of black grease across his forehead, a grin already on his face.

“If it isn’t the celebrity,” Fanie crowed, his voice echoing in the large workshop. “Come to get your chariot detailed for your next parade?”

“I’ve come to pay you, Fanie,” Koos said, holding out the envelope. “For the service. For everything.”

Fanie looked at the envelope as if it were a live snake. He waved it away with a greasy hand. “Don’t be an idiot. I told you, that was a sponsorship. ‘Fanie’s Midas: Official Mechanical Partner to the Koos van der Merwe Pie-Eating Express.’ We had a deal.” He winked, but Koos stood his ground, the envelope held firmly between them.

“A sponsorship is a business deal. This is between friends,” Koos said, his voice quiet but unyielding. He placed the envelope on a nearby workbench, on top of a stack of oil filters. “That’s for the parts and your time. Now, I’m going to the bank to pay off the last of the bakkie’s financing. I was wondering if my official mechanical partner wanted to come and witness the signing of its release papers.”

Fanie stared at his friend, his cynical armour cracking for a moment to reveal the genuine affection beneath. He wiped his hands slowly on a rag, the grin softening into something more sincere. A free bakkie. For an ordinary man, a tradesman, that was a different kind of trophy, a tangible form of freedom that was more real than any golden pie. “Ja,” Fanie said, his voice suddenly a little rough. “Ja, Koos. I’ll come with you.”

Life after the championship settled into a strange, new rhythm. His phone rang more often, but the calls were a mixed bag. For every legitimate job, there was a local sports club asking him to be a guest judge at their potjiekos competition, or a primary school wanting him to give a talk on ‘achieving your dreams’. He politely declined them all. His work, however, was different. Clients who had once barely looked at him now greeted him with a familiar handshake and an endless stream of questions about the competition. He diagnosed a fault in a washing machine while explaining the finer points of the ‘Van der Merwe Inversion’ to an elderly woman in Westdene, and fixed a flickering fluorescent light in an office while the entire accounting department gathered to ask what a two-hundred-thousand-rand pie tasted like.

One afternoon, he had a call-out to a large, modern house in the wealthy suburb of Woodland Hills. The homeowner, a woman named Mrs. Conradie with sculpted blonde hair and a sharp, assessing gaze, led him to her state-of-the-art kitchen. Her dishwasher was dead. “You’re the pie-eater, aren’t you?” she said, her tone not one of admiration, but of cool appraisal, as if she were identifying a species of garden bird. “I saw you in the paper. I must say, I was surprised to see you still working. I would have thought you’d be on a beach somewhere by now.” The implication hung in the air: a man with that kind of money shouldn’t be kneeling on her imported Italian tiles.

“There are always things that need fixing, Mevrou,” Koos replied evenly, not rising to the bait. He opened his toolbag, but instead of his old, battered multimeter, he pulled out the new Fluke 87V, its bright yellow casing a beacon of professionalism. He knelt down, the solid weight of the new tool in his hand a silent rebuttal to her condescension. The problem wasn’t simple; it was an intermittent short in the main control board, a tricky fault that a lesser electrician might have missed, recommending a costly replacement of the entire unit. Koos traced it methodically, his focus absolute, the new multimeter giving him readings of a clarity and precision he had only dreamed of. He found the burnt-out capacitor, a tiny component no bigger than his thumbnail, and replaced it with one from his kit. He reassembled the panel and switched it on. The dishwasher whirred to life with a gentle hum. He stood up, wiping his hands on a rag, and wrote out the invoice. It was for his standard call-out fee and the negligible cost of the part. Mrs. Conradie took the invoice, her eyebrows shooting up in surprise at the modest total. She looked from the invoice, to the perfectly running machine, and then to the quiet, dignified man packing away his state-of-the-art tools. “Thank you, Mr. van der Merwe,” she said, her voice stripped of its earlier edge. “That was… very efficient.”

He finished his day, as he often did, with a pilgrimage to his sanctuary. The car park at Mimosa Mall was busier than usual, and as he approached Tannie Sannie se Pasteie, he saw why. A small, but persistent, queue snaked out of the door. The sign in the window was still there, a proud, hand-drawn proclamation of his victory. Inside, the place was buzzing. Tannie Sannie, flushed and perspiring but with a fire of triumph in her eyes, was commanding a team of two new young assistants, barking orders and serving pies with a speed he’d never seen before. The menu board behind her had a new, star-shaped piece of cardboard taped to it. Written in Sannie’s familiar scrawl were the words: “Die Omgekeerde Held (The Inverted Hero) – Steak & Kidney – R25.”

“Koos, my boy!” she boomed when she finally saw him, waving him around the counter. “Look at this madness! People are driving from Kimberley, from Welkom! They all want to try the champion’s pie from the champion’s training ground!” She grabbed a bottle of Coke from the fridge and pressed it into his hand. “On the house. You’ll have to forgive me if I don’t stop to chat, we’ve sold more pies today than we did all of last week.” He didn’t want a pie anyway. His stomach still gave a little lurch at the memory. He just wanted to be there, to see this, to feel the warm, tangible ripple effect of his ten minutes of fame. He stood in the corner, out of the way, sipping his Coke and watching his friend, his coach, his chief supplier, thrive. Her success felt as good as his own.

That night, the silence in his flat felt different. It wasn’t empty anymore. It was peaceful. The Golden Pie trophy gleamed on the mantelpiece, a reminder of the madness. On the coffee table lay the Fluke 87V in its open case, a promise of the work to come. He sat on his worn couch, cleaning the new tool with a soft cloth, the methodical, repetitive motion as soothing as a prayer. He had paid off his bakkie. He had a healthy balance in his bank account for the first time in his life. He had a new tool that was the best in its class. He was still Koos van der Merwe, electrician, a man who knelt in dusty cupboards and wrestled with wires. But he was also Koos van der Merwe, co-champion, a man who had faced the best and earned their respect. The two halves of him no longer seemed to be at war. They were just… him.

His phone vibrated on the couch beside him. He picked it up, expecting a message from Fanie with another rude meme. But it was a number he didn’t recognise. The message was short, simple, and from a world away.

“Hope the jaw is recovering. Well fought. Let me know if you're defending your half of the title next year. - S. Jabavu”

Koos read the message once, then a second time. A slow, genuine smile spread across his face, the kind that crinkled the corners of his eyes. He thought of the noise, the lights, the pressure, the agonising final seconds. He looked at the gleaming trophy, then at the perfect, solid tool in his lap. He felt no pressure, no anxiety, only a quiet sense of control. He had a choice. For now, he typed a simple reply.

“Jaw is fine. You too. We’ll see about next year.”

He put the phone down, took a slow breath of the quiet evening air, and went back to cleaning his new multimeter. The work was waiting.Six months passed. The fierce Highveld sun softened into the long, golden afternoons of late autumn. The jacarandas, having long since shed their purple blossoms, now cast a sparse, skeletal shade on the suburban streets. In Bloemfontein, the story of the pie-eating electrician faded from the front pages of the *Volksblad* and became a piece of local folklore, a "do you remember when" anecdote told over beers at the Spur or in the queue at the butchery. The madness had receded, leaving behind a new and durable landscape in the life of Koos van der Merwe. The R100,000, after paying off the bakkie and buying his new multimeter, sat in his bank account not as a temptation for a lavish new life, but as a silent, reassuring buffer against the uncertainties of the world. It was a foundation, solid and deep, upon which he could build a quieter, more deliberate existence.

His days still began with the shrill cry of his phone alarm, but he no longer woke with a sense of dread. The work was the same – the faulty geysers, the tripped circuits, the melted plugs – but his relationship to it had fundamentally changed. He found a deep, satisfying pleasure in the clean precision of his new Fluke multimeter, the way its clear digital display gave him an unequivocal truth. He would arrive at a job, and the client’s inevitable "Aren't you the pie man?" would be met with a calm smile. "That was me," he’d say, "now let's take a look at this wiring." The nickname was no longer a source of embarrassment; it was simply a part of his story, an odd preface to his true trade. The respect he now commanded was not just for his fleeting fame, but for the quiet competence with which he diagnosed a problem and the transparent honesty of his invoices. He worked with a newfound patience, a confidence that smoothed out the rough edges of his days.

The weekends, once a grim expanse to be endured or a frantic training ground for a contest he never truly expected to win, were now his own. On a whim one Saturday morning, he drove out to a fishing tackle shop and bought a simple rod and reel. He started spending his Sunday mornings at Mockes Dam, a quiet stretch of water just outside the city. He wasn't a particularly good fisherman; he spent more time untangling his line and watching the coots skim across the water than he did reeling in catches. But that wasn’t the point. He sat on his fold-up chair, his loyal bakkie parked behind him, the silence broken only by the chirping of unseen birds and the gentle plop of his line hitting the water. It was the absolute antithesis of the championship: it was slow, it was quiet, there was no crowd, and the only thing he was competing against was the stubborn indifference of the fish. He found a peace in the waiting, in the simple, hopeful act of casting a line into the unknown and being content with whatever came, or didn't come, of it.

He still visited Tannie Sannie’s, but his visits were different now. The frantic queues had subsided into a steady, bustling trade, her business permanently elevated to a new level. The "Omgekeerde Held" pie was a permanent fixture on the menu, a bestseller that had allowed her to hire a full-time baker. Koos would come in during the quiet mid-afternoon lull, and they would sit at the small table in the corner where he had once conducted his gruelling capacity drills. He no longer drank water from a jug; he had a Coke, and sometimes, he would even order something to eat. Not a steak and kidney pie – that mountain was one he was not yet ready to climb again – but a simple sausage roll, or a small chicken and mushroom pie. He ate it slowly, taking small bites, savouring the flaky crust and the rich filling. He was re-learning how to enjoy food for its flavour, not its mass, to appreciate the craft of a single, well-made pie rather than the challenge of a dozen identical units.

One Tuesday afternoon, while he was methodically replacing the ancient, frayed wiring in the ceiling of a pre-war house in Waverley, his phone rang. It was Elna. He braced himself for a lecture about his cholesterol or a passive-aggressive inquiry about his financial planning, but her voice, when she spoke, was tight with a distress that had nothing to do with him. "Koos, thank God you answered. I'm having a nightmare here. The geyser's burst. There's water coming through the ceiling in the guest bathroom." He could hear a frantic, hollow dripping sound in the background of her pristine Cape Town kitchen. "I called a plumber, some fancy company with a website, and they've just left. He took one look and said the whole unit is shot, the pipes are corroded, and it's all got to be ripped out and replaced. He's quoted me fifteen thousand rand, Koos. Fifteen thousand! Does that sound right?"

Koos stopped what he was doing. He climbed down from the ladder, the scent of old dust and new copper wire clinging to him. He found a quiet spot in the hallway and spoke to his sister, not as a younger brother, but as a professional. "Okay, slow down, Elna. Where is the water coming from? Is it from the geyser itself or from one of the pipes leading to it?" he asked, his voice calm and analytical. "Did he check the vacuum breakers? What about the drip tray? Is it overflowing or is the water bypassing it completely?" He asked a dozen precise, technical questions, the kind he would ask himself on a job. She answered as best she could, her panic slowly subsiding as she was guided by the quiet authority in his voice. "He didn't check anything," she admitted after a moment. "He just stood there, shook his head, and started talking about a full system replacement." Koos was silent for a moment, picturing the scene, diagnosing the problem from a thousand kilometres away. "It sounds like a failed TP valve, Elna. A safety valve. It’s a standard part, costs maybe two hundred rand. The labour shouldn't be more than an hour. He's trying to take you for a ride," he concluded, the certainty in his voice absolute. "Call another plumber. A smaller, independent one. Ask him specifically to check the temperature and pressure valve first. Don't let them bully you."

He hung up the phone and stood for a moment in the dusty hallway of the old house. A profound sense of validation washed over him, more potent and lasting than the roar of any crowd. His sister, who had always seen his trade as a second-best option and his hobby as a joke, had turned to him in a crisis. She had needed his expertise. She had trusted his judgment over that of a slick salesman in her own city. He had fixed her problem, not with his hands, but with his knowledge, the hard-won expertise of a quarter-century of work. He climbed back up the ladder and returned to the patient, methodical work of stripping and connecting wires. He looked at the Golden Pie trophy in his mind's eye, then at the bright yellow multimeter waiting for him in his toolbag. For the first time, he saw no contradiction between them. They were both trophies, symbols of the same thing: an absolute mastery of his craft.A week later, Koos was perched precariously on a roof in the old neighbourhood of Westdene, securing a loose satellite dish that was rattling in the highveld wind. The sun was warm on his back, and the view over the tin roofs and leafy gardens was peaceful. His phone buzzed in his pocket. He clipped himself to the safety line, retrieved the phone, and saw it was Elna. He answered, expecting a follow-up question, but her voice was clear and calm, entirely free of the panicked edge it had held the week before.

“Koos, it’s me,” she began, without preamble. “I just wanted to thank you. I did what you said. I found a local guy, an old man who’s been in the business for forty years. He came over this morning. He took one look, laughed, and said it was a classic case of a failed TP valve, just like you said. He replaced it in twenty minutes. The total bill was four hundred and fifty rand.” She paused, and Koos could hear the residual disbelief in her voice. “The other company wanted fifteen thousand. They almost robbed me blind.”

“They count on people not knowing, Elna. It happens all the time,” Koos said simply, coiling a loose piece of cable.

“Yes, but I would have been one of them if it wasn’t for you,” she said, and there was a warmth and a genuine respect in her tone that he hadn’t heard since they were children. “You knew exactly what it was, just from me describing it over the phone. I… I never really appreciated it before, Koos. What you do. The knowledge it takes. I’m sorry.” The apology, unprompted and sincere, hung in the air between Bloemfontein and Cape Town. It was more valuable to him than any prize money, more satisfying than any trophy. It was an acknowledgment not of his brief, strange fame, but of his life’s work. “Thank you, Koos. Really,” she said again, before ringing off. He clipped his phone back to his belt, a slow, contented smile on his face, and returned to securing the satellite dish, the wind feeling less like a nuisance and more like a pleasant, cooling breeze.

The email arrived on a Thursday evening, two months later. Koos was at home, sitting on his couch, enjoying the quiet hum of the fridge and the distant sound of traffic. He was scrolling through his phone, looking at pictures of different fishing knots, when the notification popped up. The subject line was stark and unmistakable: “Invitation: 2024 Golden Flaky Crust National Pie-Eating Championship.” His heart gave a familiar jolt, a phantom echo of the previous year’s shock, but this time it was muted, less a high-voltage surge and more a low, humming current of dread. His thumb trembled slightly as he opened it. The same winking pie with its crown, the same corporate font. It was a formal invitation to defend his title as co-champion. The grand prize was bigger this year: two hundred and fifty thousand rand. The venue was the same. The date was set for six weeks’ time.

He read the email, but the words barely registered. The prize money held no allure. The promise of national television exposure sounded like a threat. All he could think about was the gruelling training, the water-loading that made his stomach feel like a waterlogged balloon, the aching jaw, the monotonous taste of pepper steak turning to ash in his mouth. He thought of the blinding lights, the roar of the crowd, the churning anxiety in the pit of his stomach. He had survived it once, had stumbled into a victory born of desperation and a spark of insight. But to willingly walk back into that furnace? The idea felt exhausting, a violation of the quiet peace he had so carefully constructed in his life. He closed the email and placed his phone face down on the couch. He looked at the Golden Pie trophy on his mantelpiece. It no longer looked like a symbol of victory, but like a warning, a glittering reminder of a madness he had no desire to repeat.

The next day, he found himself leaning against the familiar, greasy counter at Midas. Fanie was using a compressed air hose to blast dust out of an air filter, creating a small, localised sandstorm in the workshop. "So," Fanie said, cutting the power to the compressor and letting the dust settle. "You've been quiet all morning. You look like a man who's just been told his geyser's burst." Koos slid his phone across the counter, the email open on the screen. Fanie picked it up, wiped a thumbprint of grease from the corner, and read it. He whistled, a low, long sound of appreciation. "Two hundred and fifty grand. They're upping the stakes." He handed the phone back to Koos, his eyes narrowed in thought. "So? Are we getting the bakkie ready for another pilgrimage? The ‘Fanie’s Midas Pie-Eating Express’ rides again?" His tone was joking, but his eyes were serious, searching his friend's face.

"I don't think so, Fanie," Koos said quietly, staring at the rows of spark plugs on the shelf behind the counter. "I don't know if I can do it again. I don't know if I *want* to." Fanie leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. He was silent for a long time, the only sound the ticking of a large, grimy wall clock. "Last year," he said finally, "you needed it. You were like a man walking around in the dark, and that pie thing was the first light switch you'd found in years. But now…" He gestured around at the life Koos had built. "The bakkie's paid off. You've got money in the bank. You spend your weekends fishing, for goodness sake. You're happy, you mad bastard. You're actually happy." He shook his head, a rare, unguarded sincerity on his face. "If you do it, you do it. And I'll have this old girl purring for you. But if you don't… I get it. You've got nothing left to prove."

His visit to Tannie Sannie was even more complicated. Her business was booming, the "Omgekeerde Held" now accounting for nearly a third of her daily sales. When he showed her the email, her eyes lit up with a familiar, competitive fire. "Again! Of course, you must do it again!" she boomed, wiping her flour-dusted hands on her apron. "We'll start training next week! I've been experimenting with a lower-sodium gravy, better for endurance! We can refine the Inversion! We'll have you at fifteen pies this year, no problem!" But as she spoke, she saw the profound reluctance in his face, the weary slump of his shoulders. Her own excitement faltered. She led him to their usual table and sat down opposite him, her expression softening. "You don't want to, do you, my boy?" she asked gently.

"It's the peace, Tannie," he confessed, the word feeling inadequate to describe the quiet contentment he had found. "I like my life now. It's quiet. The fishing… the work… it's enough. That contest… it's so loud." Sannie reached across the table and patted his hand, her own hand warm and dusted with flour. "I will not lie to you, Koos. Your victory has been the best thing that ever happened to this little shop. But this little shop was doing just fine before, and it will do just fine again. You gave us all a story we'll be telling for fifty years. You don't owe us another one. You don't owe anyone anything."

He drove home that evening with the advice of his two closest friends echoing in his head. They had both, in their own way, given him permission to say no. And he wanted to. He wanted to type a polite 'thank you, but no thank you' and go back to his quiet life. But something held him back. That night, unable to sleep, he found himself scrolling through his old messages until he found the one from Sizwe Jabavu. "Let me know if you're defending your half of the title next year." It wasn't a taunt or a casual remark. It was a summons. It was one professional speaking to another, acknowledging a shared arena. It was the same kind of implicit challenge a master carpenter might issue to a rival, or a veteran mechanic to another. Sizwe hadn't shared the title out of pity; he had shared it out of respect for the craft, and an acknowledgment that a new technique had changed the game. To decline the invitation would be to turn his back not on the fame or the money, but on that respect. It would be an admission that his victory was a fluke, a one-time trick he was afraid to try again.

He stood up and walked to the mantelpiece, looking from the Golden Pie to the photo of his father. What would his dad have done? His dad, the braai master, never shied away from a challenge. If someone claimed to have a better marinade or a superior technique for grilling boerewors, his dad would invite them over for a head-to-head cook-off, not out of arrogance, but out of a deep respect for the craft itself and a desire to learn and to test his own skills against the best. He wasn't defending his pride; he was honouring his trade. Koos suddenly understood. He wasn't the same man he was last year. He didn't need to win to prove his worth to his sister or the world. He already had his own worth, cemented in the respect of his clients and the peace of his Sunday mornings. This was different. This wasn't about proving he was a champion. It was about showing up because he was one.

He walked back to the couch and picked up his phone. With calm, steady fingers, he found Sizwe Jabavu’s number and typed out a message.

“The jaw is fully recovered. I’ll see you in Sandton.”The decision, once made, settled in Koos’s chest not as a burden, but as a quiet, solid weight of purpose. He was going back. But this time, he was not going as a hopeful amateur chasing a miracle. He was going as a defending co-champion, a man with a title to his name and a technique that had rewritten the rules of the game. The training that followed was a radical departure from the frantic, desperate regimen of the previous year. The grim morning ritual of water-loading was abandoned, replaced by a simple, healthy breakfast and a long walk as the sun rose, a time for quiet thought rather than physical punishment. The temple, he had learned, performed better when it was respected, not flooded.

His sessions at Tannie Sannie se Pasteie were transformed from brutal endurance tests into something more akin to a high-level engineering workshop. The table in the corner was no longer a battlefield, but a laboratory. Tannie Sannie, her initial boisterous excitement tempered by Koos’s calm focus, embraced her role as a technical analyst. She would present him with a batch of four pies, each baked to the precise competition specification. Koos would then execute the “Van der Merwe Inversion” on each one, but his goal was not speed or volume. It was perfection. “The crush on that one was off-centre,” Sannie would observe, tapping her notebook with her pen. “You lost maybe half a second repositioning your grip for the scoop.” He would nod, take a sip of water, and move to the next pie, his mind focused entirely on the minute mechanics of the action. They analysed everything: the optimal angle of the flip to minimise air time; the precise pressure point on the base that would cause the most efficient expulsion of the filling; the most ergonomic hand movement to clear the foil tray. It was no longer about eating. It was about demolition, refined to a science.

He never ate more than four pies in a session. The goal was to build muscle memory, not stomach capacity, to make the process so automatic that he could execute it flawlessly amidst the chaos and clamour of the championship stage. After the four practice pies, he and Sannie would sit and talk, sipping Cokes while she told him about her plans to expand her kitchen and he told her about the intricacies of the wiring in the old Dutch Reformed church. His body was no longer an opponent to be conquered, but a tool to be honed, and he treated it with the same respect he now afforded his Fluke multimeter. The rest of his time was his own. His evenings were for reading or tinkering with small appliances, his mind calm and occupied. His weekends were for fishing. He found that the patient, meditative act of sitting by the dam, watching the tip of his fishing rod for the slightest tremor, was the perfect mental counterbalance to the high-speed precision of his pie technique. One required absolute stillness and patience; the other, a burst of focused, lightning-fast action. Both, he realized, demanded a quiet mind, free from distraction.

The trip to Johannesburg was a study in contrasts to the previous year’s desperate pilgrimage. Fanie, true to his word, gave the bakkie a full service, but the atmosphere in the Midas workshop was one of quiet pride, not anxious hope. There were no grand pronouncements or last-minute words of encouragement. Instead, as Koos was about to leave, Fanie simply handed him a new, custom-laminated air freshener to hang from the rearview mirror. It was a crisp, high-resolution photo of the front page of the *Volksblad*, showing Koos and Sizwe holding the trophy aloft. "Just so you remember what the view from the top looks like," Fanie said with a simple, confident grin. The drive north on the N1 felt like a commute. The sprawling beast of Gauteng was no longer an intimidating foreign territory, but simply the location of his next job. The gleaming towers of Sandton did not mock him; they were just buildings, landmarks on the way to his destination.

He checked into the same hotel, and the woman at the front desk greeted him by name. “Welcome back, Mr. van der Merwe. It’s an honour to have you with us again. We have your usual room ready for you on the seventeenth floor.” He was no longer an anonymous intruder in a work shirt; he was part of the event’s institutional memory. In his room, the vast window and the panoramic view of the city did not trigger a wave of vertigo or self-doubt. It was just a nice view. He unpacked his bag, placed his clean blue work shirt on a hanger, and sat for a while, just breathing the cool, sterile air, feeling utterly, completely calm.

The six o’clock orientation in the Gold Reef suite was a surreal experience. He walked in and saw a room full of new, hungry faces, young men with the same mixture of bravado and terror he remembered feeling himself. They looked at him as he entered, their conversations faltering. He was a legend to them, the mythical ‘Sparky’ who had come from nowhere and invented a new way to win. They watched him as he calmly took a seat near the head of the U-shaped table, not hiding in the corner this time. Then the door opened again, and Sizwe “The Juggernaut” Jabavu entered. He moved with the same coiled, predatory grace, but as his eyes scanned the room, they settled on Koos, and a flicker of a smile touched his lips. He walked directly over to Koos’s chair and extended a hand. “Koos,” he said, his voice a low, respectful murmur. “I was hoping you’d be here. It wouldn’t be a real championship otherwise.” Koos stood and shook his hand. It was a firm, dry grip, the handshake of a fellow professional. “Sizwe,” Koos replied simply. “Wouldn’t miss it.” They sat near each other, two quiet islands of calm in a sea of nervous energy, the undisputed veterans in a room of hopeful contenders. The bond between them was unspoken but palpable; they were the only two people in the world who truly understood what the other had been through, and what they were about to face again.The day of the championship arrived with the gentle, unassuming light of an ordinary morning. Koos woke in the cool silence of his hotel room, not with a jolt of adrenaline, but with the slow, steady calm of a man who knows the work that lies before him. There were no last-minute rituals of anxiety, no desperate physical preparations. He showered, dressed in his clean blue work shirt, and sat for a moment in the armchair by the window, watching the sun burn the haze off the sprawling city. He did not look at the trophy he had left at home on his mantelpiece; its purpose had already been served. Instead, he simply flexed his hands, feeling the familiar network of calluses and old scars, the tools that had brought him here. He was not here to defend a title; he was here to do a job, and he had come prepared.

The Sandton City atrium was, if anything, even more of a spectacle than the previous year. The sound system was louder, the lights were brighter, and the crowd pressed against the velvet ropes was bigger, their faces a sea of anticipation. But to Koos, the sensory assault was no longer overwhelming. It was a familiar worksite, and he understood its hazards. He navigated the throng with a quiet purpose, and this time, heads turned as he passed. People pointed, not with the mocking curiosity of last year, but with a buzz of recognition. "There he is," a man whispered to his son, "that's The Inverter." Koos offered a few shy, tight smiles, but his focus was on the stage, his destination. He felt like a seasoned contractor arriving at a building he had helped to design, familiar with its every noise and structural quirk.

The green room behind the stage was a pressure cooker of raw nerves, but the tension belonged to the new faces. A dozen hopefuls, their eyes wide with a mixture of ambition and terror, engaged in their own frantic pre-competition rituals. One man was shadow-boxing, another was meditating loudly, a third was staring at a photo of a pie as if trying to intimidate it. Koos found a quiet corner and began the simple, methodical task of cleaning his reading glasses, a familiar act that centred him. A moment later, Sizwe Jabavu entered, a pillar of calm amidst the chaos. Their eyes met across the room, and they exchanged a brief, knowing nod. There was no need for words. They were the veterans, the professionals. Their contest was not with these anxious rookies, but with the clock, the pies, and the formidable standard they had set for each other.

Brendan the MC, his suit even tighter and his hair somehow more vertical than the year before, launched into the introductions with feverish enthusiasm. The new competitors were given bombastic, forgettable nicknames. Then it was Koos's turn. "And now," Brendan roared, his voice reaching a crescendo, "the man who turned a tradition on its head and the competition upside down! The defending co-champion, the master of mechanics from Bloemfontein! Give it up for Koos... 'THE INVERTER' VAN DER MERWE!" The crowd erupted in a genuine, thunderous ovation. He walked out into the glare of the spotlights, not to a cheesy rock anthem, but to a powerful, driving beat that seemed to speak of industry and relentless progress. He took his place at station seven, gave a calm, confident wave to the cheering crowd, and focused his gaze on the empty table before him.

The siren blared, and the contest began. As Koos, with a single, fluid motion, flipped his first pie, a chaotic ripple went down the table. At least six other competitors, having studied last year’s footage, awkwardly tried to mimic his signature move. The stage descended into a farce of fumbled pastries and spilled gravy. One man crushed his pie entirely, its molten contents erupting over his hands. Another dropped his upside-down pie onto the floor. It became immediately, glaringly apparent that the Van der Merwe Inversion was not a simple trick; it was a skill, honed through hours of practice and a deep understanding of structural mechanics. The copycats had seen the 'what', but they had no grasp of the 'how'.

Koos paid them no mind. He was in his own world, a bubble of pure, mechanical focus. Flip, crush, scoop, clear. The motions were a single, seamless action, a beautiful and brutal piece of engineering. His station remained immaculate, his breathing steady, his pace metronomic. The cameras, after briefly capturing the comedic failures of the other contestants, settled on the real story: the duel between station seven and station three. Sizwe Jabavu had not adopted the Inversion. Instead, he had refined his own fearsome technique to a new level of terrifying perfection. He attacked the pies from the top, his bites powerful and precise, a flurry of controlled violence. It was a magnificent clash of styles: Sizwe’s raw, disciplined power versus Koos’s elegant, mechanical efficiency. The scoreboard became a testament to their shared dominance, the numbers climbing in near-perfect synchronicity. Four pies. Five. Six.

By the halfway mark, the rest of the field had been left far behind, struggling in a self-inflicted mess of broken crust and cooling gravy. The race was, as everyone had predicted, between the two champions. Brendan’s commentary was electric, framing the contest as a battle of philosophies. “It’s the Juggernaut’s frontal assault against the Inverter’s brilliant flanking manoeuvre! Brute force versus pure technique! Who will prevail?” The crowd was on its feet, a roaring, divided mass, chanting both their names. But on the stage, there was no animosity. There was only the intense, shared focus of two masters pushing their craft to its absolute limit. They hit ten pies simultaneously, neither man showing any sign of weakness, two perfectly calibrated machines operating at the peak of their performance.

Then, just as it seemed they were destined for another photo finish, a fissure appeared. It was on the eleventh pie. To maintain his incredible pace against Koos’s heat-negating technique, Sizwe had been absorbing the full, scalding punishment of the filling, relying on sheer willpower to push through the pain. But the body can only endure so much. A slight grimace flickered across his face. He paused for a fraction of a second, his rhythm broken, as he battled a mouthful that was simply too hot. It was a tiny falter, invisible to most, but Koos saw it. He didn’t feel a surge of triumph. He felt a quiet, professional empathy. But he did not slow down. He maintained his flawless, unwavering pace, his movements as clean and economical on his twelfth pie as they had been on his first.

In the final minute, the difference became a gulf. Koos finished his twelfth pie and, without a moment’s hesitation, reached for his thirteenth. Flip, crush, scoop. Sizwe, still fighting through his twelfth, saw Koos pull decisively ahead. A look of profound realization crossed his face. He was beaten. With a quiet dignity, he finished his twelfth pie, placed his hands on the table, and simply stopped. He didn't desperately try for another. Instead, he turned his head and watched. He watched as Koos, with seconds to spare, cleared his thirteenth foil tray, his station as neat as a freshly serviced engine. The final siren blared, a sound not of brutal interruption, but of final, conclusive punctuation.

The result was undeniable. Thirteen pies to twelve. Koos van der Merwe was the sole, undisputed champion. He felt a wave of exhaustion, but beneath it was a deep, quiet satisfaction that was profoundly different from the shocked euphoria of the previous year. He had not won by a fluke or a technicality. He had won because he had perfected his craft. The first person to approach him was not a frantic MC, but Sizwe Jabavu. He walked calmly over to station seven, extended his hand, and looked Koos in the eye. "That," Sizwe said, his voice filled with an engineer's respect for a perfect design, "was a flawless run. No one could have beaten that today. You are the champion." Then, before Brendan could intervene, Sizwe took Koos’s arm and raised it high in the air. It was not a gesture of defeat, but a clear, honourable, and public passing of the torch. The crowd’s roar was deafening. Koos van der Merwe, the quiet electrician from Bloemfontein, was the undisputed king.The world dissolved into a blizzard of golden confetti and the roar of a thousand voices. Brendan the MC, his face a mask of ecstatic disbelief, was screaming into his microphone, but the words were an incoherent wave of noise against the sheer volume of the crowd. Koos stood, blinking in the blizzard of shimmering paper, his hands resting on the table in front of him, his breathing steady but deep. He felt a hand on his arm and looked up to see Sizwe Jabavu, his face impassive but his eyes alight with a fierce, undeniable respect. Then the stage was flooded with officials and camera crews. A massive cheque for two hundred and fifty thousand rand was thrust into his hands. It was impossibly large, a cartoonish prop that felt flimsy and unreal. Then came the trophy. It was the same design as the previous year, but as he took it, he felt the full, solitary weight of it. There was no one to share it with this time. It was all his. Brendan finally got a microphone in front of his face. "Koos! Undisputed champion! Thirteen pies! You didn't just break the record, you shattered it! How does it feel?" Koos looked from the microphone to the cheering, faceless crowd, then back to the solid weight of the trophy in his hands. His answer was not for them, but for himself. "I came to do a job," he said, his voice clear and steady over the speakers. "The job is done."

Backstage, the atmosphere was thick with a mixture of reverence and defeat. The rookie competitors, their dreams of glory reduced to a mess of cold gravy and regret, parted for him as he walked through. They looked at him not as a rival, but as a force of nature, a man operating on a different plane. Sizwe was waiting for him in the quiet of the green room, away from the frantic energy of the production assistants. He was sipping slowly from a bottle of water, his posture relaxed, the tension of the contest having completely drained from his frame. "I spent six months trying to find a flaw in your technique," Sizwe said, his voice a low, analytical murmur. "I increased the temperature of my training pies, worked on my pain tolerance. I thought if I could just match your pace, my power would win out in the final minutes." He shook his head, a wry, self-deprecating smile touching his lips for the first time. "I never factored in my own heat absorption. I was cooking from the inside out. Your system… it’s not just a technique, Koos. It’s a solution. You solved the problem of the pie."

That, Koos realised, was the highest compliment he could ever receive. It was the language of his own world, the praise of one engineer for another’s elegant design. "You were faster," Koos admitted, a reciprocal gesture of professional respect. "For ten pies, you were half a second ahead on every single one." Sizwe nodded, accepting the analysis. "But speed creates friction. Friction creates heat. My system had a fatal design flaw. Yours is frictionless." He paused, looking at the undisputed champion before him, the quiet electrician in his blue work shirt. "So, what happens now?" Sizwe asked, a genuine curiosity in his eyes. "You’ve solved the pie. There are no more mountains to climb in this sport. What does the man who has perfected the machine do next?" The question hung in the air between them, a query not about next year's competition, but about the very nature of purpose itself. Koos had no answer. He just knew that for the first time, the future felt less like a question to be answered and more like a quiet space to be inhabited.

The journey home was a study in profound tranquility. The mighty Ford Ranger, with Fanie’s proud air freshener swinging gently from the rearview mirror, ate up the kilometres on the N1. The golden trophy was once again buckled securely into the passenger seat, but it no longer felt like a miraculous, alien artifact. It felt like a piece of equipment he was bringing home from a successful job, a tangible result of his expertise. He drove not with the anxious energy of a man running towards a new identity, nor with the dazed relief of a survivor, but with the steady, contented calm of a professional returning from a job well done. The endless khaki plains of the Free State felt like a welcoming embrace, the vast, open sky a balm after the compressed intensity of the city. He thought of Sizwe’s question: "What do you do next?" He didn't know the answer, and for the first time in his life, he was completely comfortable with that. The road ahead was just a road, and he was simply on his way home.

His arrival in Bloemfontein was not a surprise this time; it was a scheduled event. He drove straight to the Midas workshop, and as he pulled in, a roar went up. Fanie had closed the shop for the afternoon, and the entire yard was filled with a small, triumphant crowd. All the mechanics, Ou Piet from the butchery, a few of Koos’s regular clients—they were all there, holding plastic cups of beer and cheering as he stepped out of the bakkie. Fanie, his face beaming with a proprietary pride that was almost parental, strode forward and threw his arms around his friend. "The undisputed king!" he yelled, clapping Koos hard on the back. "I told them! I told every single one of them you were going to wipe the floor with those lighties!" He carefully unbuckled the trophy, holding it aloft not with the surprise of last year, but with the triumphant satisfaction of a prophet whose predictions had come true. It was a celebration not of a miracle, but of an expected, hard-won, and utterly dominant victory.

Later, he carried the trophy into the hallowed, fragrant space of Tannie Sannie se Pasteie. The shop was closed, but a new, professionally printed sign hung in the window: "HOME OF THE UNDISPUTED NATIONAL PIE CHAMPION. BACK TOMORROW." Inside, Tannie Sannie was waiting for him, her arms crossed, a smile of immense, almost scientific pride on her face. She didn't rush to hug him. Instead, she walked slowly towards him, her eyes fixed on the trophy. "Thirteen," she said, her voice filled with a quiet awe. "Our system delivered thirteen, Koos. It was perfect. Flawless execution." She looked at him, her gaze that of a master craftsman appraising her finest work. "I watched it on the television. Your efficiency in the final three minutes… it was a thing of beauty. You have done our work proud." Her praise was not for the celebrity or the win, but for the perfection of the process they had engineered together. It was the validation of a collaborator and a mentor, and it settled in Koos’s heart as a quiet, enduring warmth.

That night, the quiet of his flat was a welcome sanctuary. He stood before the mantelpiece and placed the second Golden Pie trophy next to the first. They flanked the photograph of his father, two gleaming, absurd sentinels guarding the memory of the braai master. The display was becoming ridiculous, a shrine to a strange and specific obsession. He looked at the two trophies, then at his worn leather toolbag waiting by the door. One represented a ten-minute explosion of fame and technical perfection. The other represented a lifetime of quiet, methodical work. For the first time, they felt like they belonged together, two sides of the same coin, different expressions of the same fundamental character. His phone buzzed, and he picked it up. It was a message from Elna. There were no questions this time, no surprise. Just a picture of a bottle of expensive champagne on her kitchen counter, and a simple line of text beneath it: "Toasting the undisputed champion tonight. I am so incredibly proud of you. Love you." He smiled, a deep, genuine smile of pure contentment, and put the phone away. He had the respect of his peers, the pride of his friends, the love of his family, and a quiet life waiting for him. The undisputed king was home, and he had everything he needed.The quiet that followed Koos’s second, undisputed victory was of a different quality than the first. The previous year’s peace had been a fragile, tentative thing, the quiet of a man holding his breath, hoping the storm wouldn’t return. This new quiet was deep and settled, the profound stillness of a landscape after the storm has definitively broken and moved on. The title of ‘champion’ was no longer a strange, ill-fitting costume, but a comfortable old coat he could choose to wear or leave on its hook. He went back to work, his days once again filled with the familiar litany of domestic electrical failures. The difference was that now, when he knelt to diagnose a faulty dishwasher, he was not just Koos the electrician; he was, to his clients, a local legend performing a mundane task, like seeing a retired Springbok captain weeding his garden. The novelty of his fame created a new kind of respect. People listened more intently when he explained the intricacies of a tripping earth leakage, and they paid his invoices with a sense of participating in a small piece of local history.

His newfound wealth, once the abstract prize in a mad contest, was now a quiet, background hum of security. With the bakkie paid off and a substantial cushion in the bank, the low-grade anxiety that had been the background noise of his entire adult life simply vanished. He no longer had to take every emergency call-out, no matter how late or inconvenient. He could afford to turn down a job if a client was rude, a small but revolutionary act of self-respect. One afternoon, while buying parts at the electrical wholesaler, he overheard a young, flustered contractor arguing with a supplier about the price of a specific, hard-to-find breaker. The supplier was intransigent. Koos, who knew the young man was honest and hard-working, quietly walked over. "Give him the contractor's discount, Johan," he said to the supplier, his voice calm and even. The supplier, who had been at the celebration at Midas, looked at Koos, then at the young contractor, and his expression softened. The discount was given. Koos had discovered a new kind of power, a quiet currency of respect that could fix problems his multimeter couldn’t.

About a month after the championship, the call came. It wasn’t Brendan, the excitable MC. It was a woman with a crisp, clipped voice who introduced herself as the Head of Marketing for the parent company of Golden Flaky Crust. She didn’t offer congratulations; she offered a future. They wanted to fly him to their head office in Johannesburg, business class, for a meeting. "We have a proposal, Mr. van der Merwe," she’d said, her voice radiating the cool confidence of someone used to getting their way. "We believe your story, your authenticity, and your unique… methodology… have significant brand potential. We’re prepared to make you an offer that would redefine your career." The phrase ‘redefine your career’ sent a chill down his spine. He liked his career. It was a good, honest career that left grime under his fingernails and brought light to dark places.

He took the problem to his trusted advisors. Fanie was wiping down a gearbox at his workbench when Koos laid out the corporate summons. Fanie’s immediate reaction was a predictable explosion of pure, practical greed. "Take it! Take it, you bloody fool!" he yelled, throwing his rag in the air. "Business class! A multi-year contract! You can hang up your toolbox for good! We could go into business together! ‘Koos and Fanie’s House of Pies’! We’ll franchise! We’ll be rich!" He danced a little jig around the workbench, his eyes gleaming with visions of untold wealth. But then he saw the profound weariness on his friend's face. He stopped his dance, his grin fading. "Ah, hell, Koos," he sighed, leaning against the bench. "It's the suits, isn't it? They'll want to own you. They'll put your face on the box and make you say things on television." He looked at his friend, his expression softening with a deep understanding. "You finally got your life quiet. And now they want to turn the volume all the way up again."

Elna’s reaction was the polar opposite. When he called her, her response was a gasp of pure, unadulterated triumph. "Koos, this is it! This is the payoff!" she exclaimed, her voice buzzing with an energy he’d never heard from her before. "This is your retirement plan! You have to take it! Think of the security, the future. You won't have to be climbing on roofs and kneeling in dusty cupboards when you’re sixty. You can hire a professional to manage the money. We can invest it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Please, please don't be sentimental about it. Be sensible." To her, the choice was simple, a matter of black and white on a balance sheet. The grime under his fingernails was not a badge of honour; it was a liability, something to be washed away by the cleansing power of a corporate contract.

He saved his visit to Tannie Sannie for last. He found her in the early morning, before the shop opened, shaping dough on a flour-dusted table, her movements slow and rhythmic. He told her about the offer, about the meeting, about the promise to ‘redefine his career’. She listened without interrupting, her hands never ceasing their patient work with the dough. When he finished, she looked up, her gaze direct and clear. "They will give you a lot of money, Koos," she said. "And they will ask you to sell their pies. But their pies are not your pies. They are made by machines in a factory a thousand kilometres away. The gravy is made in a giant vat. The pastry is designed for a long shelf life, not for the joy of a single, perfect bite." She gestured with a floury hand to the pies cooling on the rack beside her, each one slightly different, bearing the small imperfections that marked them as handmade. "My pies have a story. Your victory gave them a bigger story. But the story belongs here, in this kitchen, with these ingredients. Their pies have no story, so they want to buy yours." She looked at him, her expression a mixture of maternal pride and gentle warning. "They can’t buy the work, Koos. They can only buy the name. Be careful you don’t sell them the wrong thing."

He took their conflicting advice with him to the one place he could think clearly: the quiet, grassy bank of Mockes Dam. He sat on his fold-up chair, his fishing line a thin, hopeful thread connecting him to the still, murky water. He didn't fish. He just sat and watched the dragonflies dart across the surface. He imagined the life Elna wanted for him: a life of financial security, of smart investments and a comfortable, work-free retirement. He imagined the life Fanie half-joked about: a life of wealth, of fancy cars and maybe even a fishing boat instead of a fold-up chair. Then he imagined the life the corporation was offering: a life on camera, in boardrooms, on airplanes. A life of smiling on cue, of endorsing a product he had no connection to, of his name and face becoming a brand, a hollowed-out caricature of the victory he had so painstakingly earned. He looked down at his own hands, at the calluses and scars, the permanent grime around the nails. Those hands knew how to fix things. They knew the heft of a good tool, the satisfying click of a circuit being restored. What would those hands do in a boardroom? What problems could they solve in a television studio? He thought of Sizwe’s question: *What does the man who has perfected the machine do next?* He doesn't become the machine, Koos thought. He certainly doesn't become the machine's salesman. He goes back to his workshop and finds a new problem to solve.

The next week, he drove to Johannesburg. He wore his blue work shirt, now as much a statement of identity as a piece of clothing. The Golden Flaky Crust head office was a gleaming tower of glass and steel that seemed to disapprove of his dusty bakkie parked in the visitors' bay. He was escorted to a boardroom on the top floor, a sterile, white room with a single, vast mahogany table and a panoramic view of the city. The Head of Marketing, the woman from the phone, was there, along with two men in identical sharp suits. Brendan, the MC, hovered by the coffee machine, looking diminished and out of place in this corporate stratosphere. They were polite, effusive, and utterly confident. They laid out the offer on the polished table. It was a three-year contract as the official "Golden Flaky Crust Brand Ambassador." The salary was astronomical, dwarfing even the prize money. It involved television commercials, in-store appearances, a line of "Koos's Champion Pies," and a gruelling travel schedule. It was a blueprint for a new life, a complete and total redefinition of his career.

Koos listened patiently, nodding as they spoke, his expression calm and unreadable. He looked at the detailed contract, at the dizzying number of zeroes, at the clauses that would give them the rights to his name, his image, his story. When they finished their slick presentation, they all looked at him, their smiles fixed, expectant. The Head of Marketing slid a gold-plated pen across the table towards him. "So, Mr. van der Merwe," she said, her voice smooth as silk. "Shall we welcome you to the family?" Koos looked at the pen, then at the earnest, hungry faces of the executives. He thought of his quiet dam, of the satisfying hum of a newly fixed appliance, of the honest, greasy camaraderie of Fanie’s workshop. He did not pick up the pen. "Thank you for the very generous offer," he said, his voice quiet but firm in the silent, air-conditioned room. "It's a wonderful opportunity. But I'm afraid I have to decline." The smiles on their faces faltered, replaced by a collective mask of disbelief. "Decline?" the Head of Marketing repeated, as if the word were a foreign object.

"You see," Koos continued, a slow, easy confidence spreading through him, the quiet certainty of a man who knows exactly who he is. "I am not a brand ambassador. I am an electrician. My career has already been defined, and I like it very much. I solve problems. I bring light to dark places. That's my trade." He stood up, his chair making a small, scraping sound on the polished floor. "Your problem is that your pies have no story. My victory gave you one for free. My advice," he said, looking at each of them in turn, a master tradesman offering a piece of professional consultation, "is that you should try putting a better pie in the box. Then the story will write itself." He turned, gave a small, polite nod, and walked out of the silent boardroom, leaving the executives staring at the unsigned contract and the rejected golden pen. He walked out of the glass tower and into the warm, honest sunshine, the weight of a future he did not want lifted from his shoulders. As he drove south on the N1, back towards the flat plains and the quiet life he had so deliberately chosen, he felt a sense of freedom more profound and more valuable than any sum of money. The job was truly, finally, done. And he was going home.The quiet hum of the new distribution board was the most satisfying sound Koos had ever heard. It was a sound of safety, of order, of potential. It spoke of warm winter mornings for the crèche children and bright, well-lit evenings for the students hunched over their homework. Nomsa, the centre’s matriarch, stood beside him, her hands clasped together, her face a mask of joyous disbelief. She looked from the brilliant, steady lights to the quiet, unassuming man in the blue work shirt, a smear of brick dust on his cheek. She didn’t offer him thanks in words. Instead, she took one of his large, calloused hands in both of hers and simply held it for a moment, a gesture of profound, unspoken gratitude that resonated deeper than any public accolade.

The project at the Batho community hall became the first of many. Word of the “Champion Electrician” who performed miracles for free spread through the informal networks of the city’s struggling community organisations. Koos never sought out the work; it found him. A call from a pastor whose church was too poor to fix its faulty organ; a message from a woman who ran a small, unfunded animal shelter where the kennels were cold and dark; a plea from a soup kitchen operating out of a garage with a single, dangerously overloaded extension cord. Each one was a new problem to be solved, a new, faulty circuit to be made right. He used his time and his skills, and when necessary, his money, which he now viewed not as a prize to be hoarded, but as a tool in his kit, another resource to be deployed for a job.

Fanie became his willing, if perpetually grumbling, partner in these weekend endeavours. “I swear, Koos, you’re trying to turn me into a saint,” he’d complain, while expertly drilling a hole for a new conduit at a home for orphaned children. “There’s no money in sainthood. My reputation as a cynical bastard is taking a serious hit.” But he never said no. He would show up every time, his bakkie loaded with tools and his spirit full of a gruff, practical compassion. Their friendship, forged over years of shared jokes and greasy engine parts, was tempered into something stronger in these places, a silent partnership dedicated to the simple, noble act of fixing what was broken.

His life settled into a new, deeply fulfilling cadence. Weekdays were for his paying customers, for earning a living and maintaining the quiet, comfortable life he had built. Weekends were for the work that fed his soul. His fame, which had once been a source of anxiety, became a tool. When a large hardware chain heard about his projects, they offered him an unlimited line of credit for materials, their contribution made quietly, without press releases or photo opportunities. His reputation opened doors and softened hearts, allowing him to channel the goodwill of the community towards the places that needed it most. He was a conduit, not just for electricity, but for generosity.

One crisp autumn Saturday, he was on a ladder at the animal shelter, installing new, waterproof lighting in the outdoor dog runs, when a sleek silver sedan he didn’t recognise pulled into the gravel driveway. A man got out. He was tall and lean, dressed in smart casual clothes, and he moved with a familiar, athletic grace. It was Sizwe Jabavu. Koos nearly dropped his wire strippers in surprise. “Sizwe?” he called down from the ladder. “What on earth are you doing in Bloemfontein?”

Sizwe looked up, shielding his eyes from the sun, a rare, relaxed smile on his face. “I had a meeting with a sponsor in town,” he said. “I asked around where I might find you. Someone at a hardware store told me if I wanted to find the champion, I should look for a place with flickering lights and a dusty Ford Ranger parked outside.” He looked around at the humble shelter, at the half-finished wiring, at Koos perched on the ladder in his work shirt. “This is what you do now?” he asked, a note of genuine curiosity in his voice. “This is the answer to my question?”

“This is part of it,” Koos said, climbing down the ladder. He wiped his hand on his trousers before shaking Sizwe’s. “It’s good to see you.” The two men, the undisputed titans of a strange and punishing sport, stood in the dusty yard of a small animal shelter in the middle of the Free State. It was a meeting of two worlds, two lives that had briefly, spectacularly, intersected. “I watched the championship this year,” Koos said. “You won. Twelve pies. No one came close.” Sizwe had indeed reclaimed his solo title, the competition returning to a predictable procession now that the Inverter was no longer in the field. “It was hollow,” Sizwe said with a shrug, his honesty stark. “There was no challenge. The problem has been solved. I was just repeating the victory, not earning it. This,” he said, gesturing around the shelter, “this looks like a new problem.”

Koos showed him around, explaining the faulty wiring, the need for safe, warm lighting for the abandoned animals. Sizwe, an engineer by training, listened with a focused intensity, asking sharp, intelligent questions about amperage and load balancing. He looked at the neatly laid cables, the professional installation of the new distribution board. He saw the same meticulous, problem-solving mind that had beaten him on the stage, now applied to a different, more meaningful challenge. As they stood by the puppy enclosure, watching a litter of energetic mongrels tumble over each other, Sizwe turned to Koos. "I'm retiring from the circuit," he announced quietly. "There's nothing left for me there. I'm starting a foundation. A trust to provide scholarships for promising engineering students from disadvantaged backgrounds. To help them solve real problems." He looked at Koos, a new partnership dawning in his eyes. "I need a trustee. Someone with a practical mind, who understands the value of a trade, who knows what it means to build something from the ground up. Someone who knows the difference between the prize and the work."

Koos stared at him, stunned into silence. A trustee. A foundation. It was a world away from wires and circuits, yet it felt like the most natural extension of everything he had become. It was another way to fix things, to complete a circuit, to bring power and light to a place where it was needed. He thought of his quiet, ordered life, his weekends fishing at the dam. This was a complication. This was a responsibility. It was a new, unexpected current entering his carefully wired life. But it was not noise. It was a signal. A clear, powerful signal of a new job that needed doing.

“I’m just an electrician, Sizwe,” Koos said, the old, humble refrain surfacing one last time.

“No, Koos,” Sizwe replied, a smile spreading across his face. “You are the man who solved the pie. A man who can do that can do anything.” He extended his hand, not as a competitor, but as a partner. Koos looked at the offered hand, then at the dusty yard, the hopeful faces of the puppies, the half-finished wiring that promised light and warmth. He thought of his father, the master of the braai; of Fanie, the loyal mechanic; of Tannie Sannie, the proud baker; of Elna, the pragmatic sister. He thought of his two gleaming, absurd trophies on the mantelpiece. He had won his titles, secured his peace, and now, a new and worthy problem had presented itself. With a slow, sure movement, he reached out and shook Sizwe’s hand. The work was never truly done. There was always another circuit to complete.
