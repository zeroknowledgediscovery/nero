The hiss of the shallots hitting the hot pan was a sound more familiar to Amelia Russo than her own heartbeat. It was a sharp, promising sizzle, the opening note in a culinary symphony she conducted five nights a week. Sweat trickled down the nape of her neck, sticking a stray strand of dark hair to her skin, but she didn't notice. Her entire world had narrowed to this nine-inch copper pan, the glistening butter, the translucent edges of the alliums. Garlic followed, a fragrant explosion, then a careful shower of thyme leaves. The scent rose up, earthy and sweet, a ghost of flavour made real. This was her church. The kitchen of ‘Verve’, perched on the edge of Brisbane’s New Farm, was a temple of heat, steel, and controlled chaos. And she, Head Chef Mia Russo, was its high priestess.

“Scallops walking in, Chef!” a voice called from the pass.

“Walking!” Mia called back, her voice a low, focused rasp. Her hands moved with an economy born of a thousand services. She slid the shallot mixture onto a waiting plate, wiped the pan with a practiced flick of a cloth, and returned it to the flame. More butter. Higher heat. She held the back of her hand over the pan, feeling the inferno radiating from the copper. Three seconds. Perfect. The scallops, pale and plump as a baby’s fist, were laid gently into the shimmering fat. They screamed. A glorious, searing shriek that promised a perfect Maillard crust. Ben, her sous-chef and resident cynic, slid up beside her, plating a delicate tower of cured kingfish with grapefruit and fennel.

“Still humming, boss?” he murmured, not looking up from his tweezers. “What is it tonight? A bit of Puccini for the Wagyu?”

Mia offered a tight smile, her eyes never leaving the pan. “Joni Mitchell, you philistine. ‘A Case of You’.” She flipped the scallops one by one, each revealing a crust the colour of old gold. A splash of verjuice, a cloud of steam, a final knob of butter swirled in to create an emulsion. “And for your information, the Wagyu gets Zeppelin. It needs the gravitas.”

“Right,” Ben snorted, wiping the edge of his plate. “God forbid the seventy-dollar steak feels under-appreciated.” He nudged her with his elbow. “Seriously though, you looked a million miles away. Thinking about the big show?”

The big show. ‘Australia’s Aria’. The name itself felt ridiculous on her tongue, a confection of glitter and hyperbole so far removed from her world of cast iron and kosher salt. Yet, it was a persistent fever dream that had somehow bled into her waking life. The audition had been a dare, a joke between her and Ben after a particularly brutal Saturday service, fuelled by cheap beer and a shared sense of what-if. She’d gone on a whim, queuing with teenagers in ripped jeans and stage-school prodigies with veneers that shone brighter than her best-polished saucepan. She’d stood on the X-marked spot, blinded by the lights, and sung an Etta James ballad not to the three unimpressed-looking judges but to the memory of her grandfather, the one who’d taught her that both a bolognese and a ballad required soul. She’d expected nothing. A polite ‘thank you, next’. But then they’d called her back. And then again. Now she was in a holding pattern, one of twenty hopefuls waiting to see if they’d make the televised live finals. The final ten. It was a statistical improbability, a daydream she was almost ready to wake up from.

“I’m thinking about the split pea velouté for table seven,” she deflected, spooning the sauce over the scallops with surgical precision. “Hand me the micro-parsley, will you?”

Ben passed her the small container. “Alright, alright. Keep your secrets. But if you make it, I get to be your plus-one. I want to see what one of those TV judges looks like up close. I reckon they’re CGI.”

The rest of the service was a blur of dockets, calls, and searing heat. Lamb racks, pan-fried gnocchi, a deconstructed lamington that was a social media sensation. It was a dance she knew intimately, every step, every beat. But tonight, beneath the rhythm of the kitchen, another melody played. The high, clear notes of a dream she’d kept locked away for years, a secret song. It was only when the last docket was cleared, the last plate wiped, and the weary camaraderie of cleanup had settled over the kitchen crew, that she allowed the music to take over. As she scrubbed down her station, the notes of Joni Mitchell finally escaped her lips, no longer a hum but a soft, full-bodied melody that seemed to hang in the humid, grease-scented air. The clatter of pans quietened for a moment. One of the young apprentices, scrubbing a pot, stopped and just listened, a look of surprise on his face. Ben caught her eye and gave a slow, deliberate nod. It wasn't a joke. It was a concession. It was a compliment.

Leaving the restaurant, the Brisbane night hit her like a wall of warm, wet velvet. The air, thick with the scent of frangipani and river water, clung to her skin. The city’s lights painted the low clouds a bruised orange. Most nights, she’d walk home, the twenty-minute journey a necessary decompression chamber between the pressure cooker of the kitchen and the silence of her apartment. But tonight, her feet took her on a different route, a pilgrimage. She found herself heading towards Paddington, towards the rickety silhouette of a house propped up on stilts, a wooden galleon sailing a sea of untamed bougainvillea and overgrown ferns. Uncle Alfie’s house.

He was her great uncle, her grandfather’s younger brother, and the sole remaining keeper of the family’s eccentricities. While her grandfather had channelled his passion into sauces, Alfie had poured his into everything else. He was, in the kindest possible terms, a packrat, a magpie, a man who saw potential history in a bottle cap and profound art in a piece of sea-worn driftwood, and his house was his nest. The front gate groaned a familiar protest as she opened it. The path to the towering front steps was a mosaic of mismatched tiles he’d salvaged over fifty years. Wind chimes made of old silverware and sea glass tinkled a discordant welcome from the verandah.

The front door was, as always, unlocked. “Alfie?” she called into the dimly lit interior.

The house smelled of old books, beeswax, and something vaguely spicy, like cinnamon toast. Every surface was a curated chaos of artifacts: stacks of National Geographics from the 1970s, a collection of antique glass eyeballs on a velvet cloth, a ship in a bottle next to a taxidermied kookaburra that had lost its perch and now stared perpetually at the ceiling.

“In the conservatory!” a reedy voice called back. The conservatory was a grand name for the enclosed back verandah, a glass-panelled room that overlooked a jungle of a backyard and held his most prized possessions: his record player and his collection of vinyl.

She found him there, a wiry man with a cloud of white hair and eyes that still held a startlingly blue, mischievous glint, hunched over a spinning disc of black vinyl. He was wearing a paisley shirt that might have been fashionable forty years ago and a pair of tweed trousers held up by bright red suspenders. He placed the needle onto the record with the delicacy of a bomb disposal expert. The crackle, then the warm, mournful sound of a cello filled the room.

“Ah, Jacqueline du Pré,” he said, turning to Mia with a beatific smile. “She played as if her soul was trying to escape through the strings. A bit like you, my girl. When you really let go.” He shuffled over and enveloped her in a hug that smelled of paper and Earl Grey tea. “You’ve got kitchen on you,” he stated, sniffing her chef’s jacket. “Garlic. Thyme. A hint of shellfish anguish. A good service?”

“A long service,” Mia corrected, sinking into a worn wicker armchair that groaned under her weight. “But good.”

“Good. The world needs good food.” He pottered over to a small table laden with decanters of various amber liquids. “A celebratory sherry? Or is it a commiseratory port? Where do we stand in the grand opera of your life?”

“We stand in limbo, Alfie. No news. Probably means no news is bad news.”

“Nonsense,” he scoffed, pouring a small measure of amber liquid into a delicate, dusty glass. “No news means the universe is still composing the next movement. It takes time to arrange a triumph.” He handed her the glass. “I, for the record, am certain of the outcome. I had a dream last night. A magpie flew in through the window and stole my favourite teaspoon. A clear omen of impending fortune.”

Mia sipped the sherry. It was nutty and complex, coating her tongue. “Alfie, last week you said a magpie stealing something was a sign of a tax audit.”

“Ah, but this was a different teaspoon,” he said with unshakeable logic. “Context, my dear Amelia, is everything.” He sat opposite her, his face serious in the low light. “You are worried. I can see it. It’s in your shoulders. You’re wound up tighter than the mainspring on my old fob watch.”

“It’s just… silly,” she confessed, staring into her glass. “I’m a chef. I’m thirty-two years old. I have a mortgage. What am I doing chasing some… teenage fantasy? I should be focused on getting a third hat for the restaurant, not singing karaoke on national television.”

Alfie leaned forward, his blue eyes intense. “Do not ever, ever call what you do karaoke. You have your mother’s voice and your grandfather’s heart. That is not a combination for the faint of spirit. You think this is a fantasy? Your grandfather, my brother, spent forty years perfecting a ragu he learned from his mother. Forty years on one sauce. People called that a silly obsession. But when they tasted it, they called it a revelation. Passion is never silly, Amelia. It’s the only thing that is truly real.” He gestured around the cluttered room. “This is my ragu. All this… junk. It’s my story. The food you make is yours. And the songs you sing? That’s the oldest story of all. Don't you dare be ashamed of it.”

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, letting the cello fill the space between them. With Alfie, Mia never felt the need to fill the silence. He was the one person with whom she could just be. He understood the quiet hum of anxiety that always ran beneath her skin, the strange dual-life she felt she was living between the brutal, tangible world of the kitchen and the ethereal, untouchable world of her music.

As the record finished, spinning silently in its groove, a sudden, jarring noise cut through the quiet. The shrill, electronic ringing of her mobile phone. It sounded like an intruder in Alfie’s analogue sanctuary. She fumbled in her pocket, her heart giving a sudden, stupid lurch. The screen glowed with an unknown number, a Sydney area code. Her breath caught in her throat.

“Well?” Alfie prompted, his eyes wide with anticipation. “Answer it. The magpie waits.”

Her thumb hovered over the screen. It could be anything. A wrong number. A sales call. But it felt different. The air in the room felt different, suddenly charged with possibility. She took a deep breath, the way she did before stepping out to the pass on a fully booked Saturday night, and answered.

“Hello, Amelia Russo speaking.”

The voice on the other end was bright, professional, and impossibly cheerful. “Amelia! Hi, it’s Chloe from ‘Australia’s Aria’. How are you this evening?”

“I’m… good. Fine,” Mia stammered, her knuckles white as she gripped the phone. Alfie was leaning so far forward he was nearly out of his chair.

“I’m not going to beat around the bush, Amelia. We’ve had a bit of a development here. One of our top ten finalists has had to withdraw for personal reasons.” Chloe paused, and in that second-long silence, Mia felt the entire world hold its breath. “The producers have met, and we’ve reviewed the scores. You were our first alternate. We’d like to offer you the vacant spot in the Grand Final.”

The words didn't seem to make sense. They were just sounds. Grand Final. Spot. Offer. She looked at Alfie, her eyes wide and uncomprehending. He was smiling, a huge, triumphant grin spreading across his wrinkled face. He pumped a fist in the air.

“Did you say… the final?” Mia asked, her voice a whisper.

“That’s right! The Grand Final! Welcome to the top ten, Amelia. Your life is about to get a little bit crazy. We’re flying you down to Sydney in two days. A car will be at your house at 8 a.m. on Thursday. All the details will be in your email in about five minutes. Congratulations.”

Mia mumbled a thank you, her mind a complete blank. She ended the call and stared at the phone in her hand as if it were a strange, alien artifact. She looked up at Alfie. The silence stretched. Then, a slow smile spread across her face, a real, uninhibited smile that reached her eyes and made her feel about sixteen years old.

“Well?” Alfie said, his voice trembling with excitement.

“I’m in,” she said, the words finally feeling real as she spoke them aloud. “Alfie… I’m in the final.”

For a moment, he just beamed at her. Then he pushed himself up from his chair with a surprising agility, strode over to the record player, and rummaged through a stack of vinyl. He pulled one out, a worn copy of Queen’s ‘A Night at the Opera’.

“This,” he declared, placing it on the turntable with a flourish, “calls for a proper overture.” He cranked the volume dial far higher than his old speakers could probably handle. As the first iconic, layered harmonies of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ filled the conservatory, Alfie grabbed her hands and pulled her up from the chair. And there, in the cluttered, dusty room, surrounded by a lifetime of collected memories, the chef and the old magpie danced, clumsy and joyful, as Freddie Mercury’s voice soared into the warm Brisbane night, promising that this was the real life, not just fantasy.The final piano chords of the song faded, leaving a ringing silence broken only by the frantic thumping of Mia’s own heart and the tick-tock of a dozen antique clocks, all telling slightly different versions of the time. The euphoria of the moment began to recede, replaced by a cold wave of pure, undiluted panic. Alfie was still beaming, his eyes shining, but Mia sank back into the wicker armchair, the celebratory energy draining out of her. The weight of her reality, the nine-inch copper pan and the seventy-dollar steak, came rushing back in.

“Oh god,” she breathed, running a hand through her hair. “The restaurant. Ben. I have to be on a plane in two days? What am I going to do? I can’t just… walk out. We’re fully booked. We have a new tasting menu launching next week. I have produce orders to sign off on, staff rosters…” The litany of responsibilities spilled out of her, a frantic attempt to build a wall of practicality against the impossible dream that had just breached her defences.

Alfie tutted, waving a dismissive hand as he carefully lifted the needle from the record. “Details, details. The kitchen is a ship, Amelia. You are its captain, yes, but you have built it well. You have a first mate in that cynical young man, do you not? A ship worth its salt should be able to weather a small storm without the captain tied to the wheel every second. This is not walking out. This is a voyage of discovery.” He poured himself another sherry, his hand perfectly steady. “You will call Ben. You will delegate. You will trust the symphony you have already composed to play on for a few weeks. If you cannot do that, then you do not trust your own work.”

His logic was, as usual, both infuriating and unassailable. He was right. She had spent five years building Verve, not just as a place to cook, but as a system, a team. Ben was more than capable of running the pass; he’d been doing it alongside her for two years. He knew her palate, her standards, her rhythms. The thought of the kitchen without her at the helm still sent a spike of anxiety through her, a possessive, territorial pang she was not proud of. It was her temple. But Alfie was right. A high priestess should be able to trust her acolytes.

The walk back to her apartment was a dizzying blur. The familiar streets of her neighbourhood seemed alien, tilted on a new axis. The frangipani smelled sweeter, the city lights harsher. Her mind was a battlefield. One half was screaming with sheer, terrified excitement, replaying the phone call, the impossible words ‘Grand Final’. The other half was methodically running through the Verve coolroom inventory, mentally drafting a prep list for the next 48 hours and composing a series of stern but motivating speeches for her team. She felt split in two, the pragmatic chef and the terrified singer warring for control, and she wasn't sure which one was winning.

Back in the sterile quiet of her apartment, which was always a shock after the sensory overload of Alfie’s house, she opened her laptop. The email was there, with the subject line: ‘Congratulations & Welcome to the Australia’s Aria Top 10!’. It was a document of surreal professionalism. Attached were flight details, a hotel confirmation, a non-disclosure agreement, and a packed itinerary that mentioned vocal coaching, wardrobe fittings, and media training. Media training. Mia snorted. The only media she was trained for was the occasional fawning food blogger who she’d charm with a free dessert. This was a different stratosphere. This was real.

Taking a deep breath, she picked up her phone and dialled Ben’s number. He answered on the second ring, his voice wary. It was after midnight. A call from her at this hour usually meant the coolroom had died or she’d had a sudden, terrible idea for a new dish that would involve two days of solid prep.

“Don’t tell me,” he said, his voice thick with sleep. “You want to sous-vide a ghost.”

“Better,” she said, her own voice sounding strange and distant to her ears. “I need you to run the restaurant for a few weeks.”

There was a long silence on the other end of the line. She could picture him perfectly: sitting up in bed, scrubbing a hand over his face, his brow furrowed in confusion. “Run it? As in, you’re taking a holiday? In the middle of May? Did you hit your head? Who are you and what have you done with my boss?”

“I’m not on holiday. I’m… Ben, I got the call. From the show.”

Another silence, this one charged with dawning comprehension. “No,” he said, the word drawn out. “No. Fucking. Way.”

“They had a dropout. I was the first alternate. I’m in the top ten. They’re flying me to Sydney on Thursday morning.” The words tumbled out, and with them, a giddy, breathless laugh. It was the first time she’d laughed since the phone call, a genuine, unburdened sound.

“Holy shit,” Ben breathed. The cynicism was gone, replaced by something that sounded suspiciously like awe. Then, almost immediately, the pragmatism kicked in, the sous-chef taking over. “Okay. Okay. Thursday. That’s… soon. Right. The tasting menu, we’ll postpone the launch. I’ll talk to reservations. I can rework the specials board based on what we have coming in. The gnocchi prep, Chloe can handle it, she’s almost there. I’ll run the pass. We can do it. Holy shit, Mia. You’re actually doing it.”

Hearing him, her second-in-command, her rock, shift so seamlessly from shock to strategy was the anchor she desperately needed. The panic in her chest subsided, replaced by a wave of gratitude so strong it almost brought tears to her eyes. He wasn't questioning her. He wasn't telling her it was a crazy risk. He was simply picking up the tools she was setting down and getting to work.

“You think you can handle it?” she asked, the question a formality.

“Are you kidding? I’ve been waiting for my chance to put Zeppelin on for the scallops,” he shot back, a hint of his usual humour returning. “Just don’t forget us little people when you’re a superstar. And Mia? Break a leg. Seriously. Go and sing the roof off the place.”The forty-eight hours that followed were a masterclass in controlled panic. Mia moved through her kitchen not as its high priestess, but as a ghost preparing for her own wake. She arrived at dawn on Wednesday, a full two hours before anyone else, and began to prep with a silent, furious energy. She brined chickens, portioned fish with obsessive precision, and made enough stock to see the restaurant through a biblical flood. When Ben arrived, he found her with her arm elbow-deep in a vat of dough for their house-made sourdough, a wild look in her eye. He took one look at her flour-streaked face and simply took the bowl from her hands.

“Go home, Mia,” he said, his voice gentle but firm.

“I just need to finish the base for the mushroom pâté, and check the coolroom seals, and write a memo about stacking the plates for the gnocchi, the new apprentices are still chipping them…”

“I will handle the pâté, I will check the seals, and I will personally demonstrate the art of not-chipping-the-fucking-plates to the apprentices,” Ben interrupted. He steered her towards the staff lockers. “You have a plane to catch tomorrow. You need to pack. You need to sleep. You need to stop acting like this entire building will spontaneously combust the second you’re not in it.” He paused, his expression softening from exasperation to something more genuine. “I’ve got this. We’ve got this. Go. Become a rock star.”

She wanted to argue, to insist on her own indispensability, but the exhaustion she had been holding at bay for two days washed over her in a sudden, crushing wave. He was right. She looked around at the gleaming steel, the neatly stacked pans, the hum of the refrigerators. It was a well-oiled machine. Her machine. And it was time to see if it could run without her. She gave Ben a quick, hard hug, a gesture so uncharacteristic it made him stiffen in surprise for a second before he clapped her on the back. “Don’t burn the place down,” she muttered into his shoulder.

“Only if the Zeppelin gets out of hand,” he promised.

That night, after packing a bag that felt schizophrenic in its contents—jeans and chef clogs on one side, a single, hopeful black dress on the other—she found she couldn’t rest. She walked back to Verve, letting herself in through the back door long after the last staff member had left. The kitchen was silent, scrubbed clean, and smelled of bleach and citrus. It was sterile and unfamiliar without the heat and the noise. She ran her hand along the cool stainless-steel pass, the surface that had been the altar of her church for five years. This was real. She was leaving. She reached into her locker, pulling out her worn knife roll. Unfurling it on the bench, she selected her smallest paring knife, its wooden handle worn smooth and dark with use, shaped perfectly to her palm. It had been her grandfather’s. Without thinking, she slipped it into the side pocket of her handbag. A talisman. A piece of her old religion to take into the new.

Alfie insisted on coming with her to the airport, turning up at her apartment at seven a.m. in a taxi, dressed in a jaunty captain’s hat and a Hawaiian shirt patterned with what looked like belligerent cockatoos. He thrust a small, lumpy package wrapped in brown paper and string into her hands. “For the journey,” he announced. Inside was a 1960s-era Walkman, complete with foam-padded headphones and a single cassette tape. The handwritten label read: ‘Courage. J. Baez.’

“Alfie, I don’t think they’ll let me take this on the plane. It looks like a detonator,” she said, though she was touched.

“Nonsense. It’s analogue. It has soul. The security machines won’t know what to do with it,” he said with complete confidence. At the departure gate, he gave her another one of his surprisingly strong hugs. “Remember, Amelia. A high note is the same as a perfect sear. It’s all about heat, timing, and not being afraid to get burned.”

The flight to Sydney was like entering a decompression chamber. As the patchwork of Brisbane’s tin roofs and winding river gave way to an endless expanse of blue, Mia felt the chef part of her identity begin to recede, becoming smaller and smaller. In its place, a terrified, exhilarating void opened up. She wasn’t Chef Mia Russo anymore. She was just Amelia Russo, a woman with a paring knife and a Joan Baez tape in her bag, flying towards a future she couldn’t possibly imagine.

Sydney hit her like a splash of cold water. The airport was brighter, louder, and moved at a faster tempo than Brisbane. A driver was waiting for her, holding a sign with the garish, star-spangled logo of ‘Australia’s Aria’. He was young and unfazed, barely looking at her as he took her bag and led her to a sleek black car. The city flashed past the window, a vista of glittering glass towers, iconic harbour views, and a palpable thrum of ambition. It was beautiful and intimidating. It did not feel like home.

The hotel was a monument to chic anonymity, a five-star tower of grey marble and hushed corridors. Her room, on the twenty-third floor, was larger than her entire Brisbane apartment. It had a king-sized bed with a dozen unnecessary pillows, a bathroom encased in glass, and a floor-to-ceiling window with a staggering view of the city skyline. It was luxurious, impersonal, and deeply lonely. She stood at the window, looking down at the frantic choreography of the traffic below, and felt a profound sense of vertigo that had nothing to do with the height. A message on the hotel room television screen welcomed her and listed her first appointment: ‘Contestant Welcome Mixer. 6 p.m. The Zenith Bar.’

At ten minutes to six, after changing her outfit three times and settling on plain black jeans and a simple grey silk shirt, she took the lift down to the lobby bar. The Zenith Bar was a caricature of sophistication, all dark wood, low lighting, and overpriced cocktails. In a cordoned-off section, a small group of people were gathered. Her competitors. Her stomach twisted into a knot of pure dread. They were so young. A girl with shocking pink hair and a nose ring was laughing loudly with a boy who looked like he’d stepped straight out of a surf-wear catalogue. Another young woman, impossibly poised and elegant in a white dress, was holding court with a cluster of others, her posture ramrod straight. Mia recognised her from the audition circuit; she was the stage-school prodigy, the one with the perfect veneers.

Mia hovered at the edge of the group, feeling like a frumpy substitute teacher who had accidentally stumbled into the cool kids’ party. She grabbed a glass of mineral water from a passing waiter and tried to look like she belonged. Chloe, the producer from the phone call, a whirlwind of energy in a sharp blazer, spotted her and swooped in.

“Amelia! You made it! So glad you’re here,” she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. “Let me introduce you to some people.” She dragged Mia towards the centre of the group. “Everyone, this is Amelia Russo, our tenth finalist! She’s joining us from Brisbane.”

A dozen pairs of eyes turned to her. They were assessing, curious, and in some cases, openly hostile. A collective murmur of ‘hi’s went through the group. The girl in the white dress, whose name was apparently Savannah, gave her a smile that was as polished and sharp as a shard of glass. “A chef, I heard?” Savannah said, her voice a tinkling bell. “How… quaint. I guess we won’t have to worry about the catering.”

A ripple of polite laughter went through the group. Mia felt a hot flush of anger and humiliation. Before she could think of a reply that wasn’t a string of kitchen curses, a quiet voice beside her spoke up. “I think it’s cool. Anyone who can handle a Saturday night service is probably tougher than the rest of us put together.”

Mia turned. The speaker was a man in his late twenties, with a scruffy beard, kind eyes, and calloused fingertips that suggested he was intimately familiar with a guitar fretboard. He was holding a beer and looking at her with a genuine, friendly expression. “I’m Leo,” he said, extending a hand. “Don’t mind Savannah. Her dad’s a producer. She was born on a stage.”

“Mia,” she said, shaking his hand. His grip was firm and reassuring. “And thanks.”

“No worries. So, what’s your poison? Musically, I mean.”

“Old soul, mostly. Etta James, Joni Mitchell.”

Leo’s eyes lit up. “A purist. Respect. I’m more in the Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley camp. We’re the dinosaurs here. Most of these kids were born after the year 2000. They think Spotify is a vintage format.” He gestured with his beer towards the pink-haired girl. “That’s Krystal. Big on TikTok. The surfer kid is Dylan. Sings like an angel, thinks like a fence post. It’s a zoo.”

The conversation with Leo was a small, welcome island in a sea of anxiety. He was an indie-folk singer from Melbourne who, like her, seemed slightly bewildered by the slick machinery of the show. But even as they talked, she could feel the weight of the room, the constant, low-level hum of competition. These weren’t just fellow singers; they were obstacles. Each one of them wanted the same thing she now, terrifyingly, wanted too. As a famous television host she vaguely recognised took a microphone to give a welcome speech full of hyperbole and brand-sponsored buzzwords, Mia looked around at the faces of the nine other people whose lives were now inextricably tangled with her own. Alfie had called it a triumph. Ben had called it a rock-star move. Right now, looking at Savannah’s predatory smile and the blinding glare of the professional camera lights that had just been switched on, it felt like a terrible, beautiful mistake.The welcome speech was delivered by a man with teeth so white they seemed to generate their own light source. He spoke in a stream of effusive clichés about journeys, dreams, and the life-changing power of the ‘Aria’ family, which was, he reminded them, proudly sponsored by a popular telecommunications company. Mia tuned it out, the same way she tuned out the low hum of the extraction fans at the end of a long night. It was background noise. What she focused on was the foreground: the subtle shift in Savannah’s posture when the host mentioned the grand prize, a recording contract and a hundred-thousand dollars; the way Dylan the surfer-kid’s eyes were glazed over with a look of pure, unadulterated ambition; the nervous tic in Krystal’s leg, bouncing under the table. This wasn’t a family. It was a shark tank, and she’d just been tossed in wearing a steak-scented blazer.

The next morning, her new life began at an unforgiving 8 a.m. The itinerary, which had been slipped under her door during the night, mapped out her day in fifteen-minute increments. Vocal coaching, media training, wardrobe consultation, choreography pre-planning. It read less like a schedule and more like an instruction manual for the construction of a pop star. Her first appointment was with Julian Croft, the show’s head vocal coach, a man whose name was spoken in hushed, reverent tones by the younger contestants. She found him in a sound-proofed studio in the basement of the network building, a minimalist white room dominated by a grand piano and an intimidatingly large mixing desk. Julian was thin and severe, dressed head-to-toe in black, with sharp, intelligent eyes that seemed to see right through her.

“Amelia Russo. The chef,” he said, without preamble. He didn’t offer to shake her hand. He gestured towards a microphone in the centre of the room. “They tell me you have an interesting instrument. Show me.” The dismissal in his tone, the way he reduced her entire career to a quirky label, made the back of her neck prickle with defiance. She walked to the microphone, her worn boots feeling clumsy on the polished concrete floor. She took a breath, closed her eyes, and pushed away the sterile white room. She thought of her grandfather’s dusty gramophone, of the smell of garlic and thyme, of the soul he said was the essential ingredient. And she sang. It was the Etta James ballad, ‘I’d Rather Go Blind’, the song that had gotten her here. She didn’t perform it; she bled it, pouring every ounce of longing and secret heartbreak she’d ever felt into the melody.

When she finished, the silence in the room was absolute. She opened her eyes. Julian was staring at her, his expression unreadable. For a long moment, he said nothing. Then, he steepled his fingers. “Well. The instrument is certainly there. A lot of power. A lot of… raw feeling.” He made the word ‘raw’ sound like an unfortunate medical condition. “But it’s completely undisciplined. It’s all over the place. And the song choice is a commercial graveyard. We can’t sell that.”

Mia’s jaw tightened. “It’s a classic. It has soul.”

“It has dust,” Julian corrected coolly. “This is a primetime television show, Amelia, not a speakeasy in 1968. Our audience is sixteen-year-old girls and their mothers. They don’t want soul. They want relatability. They want a story.” He stood up and began to pace. “The chef angle is good. It’s a strong narrative. The rustic, authentic artist. But we need to pair it with the right product. Something current. Something that sounds like it belongs on the radio this year, not fifty years ago. I’m thinking something by Florence and the Machine. Maybe a stripped-back Adele cover. Big voice, but modern. We sand down the rough edges, we focus the power, we give you a story the audience can buy.”

He was talking about her voice as if it were a cut of meat that needed to be trimmed and portioned for a more palatable dish. He wanted to take her grandfather’s ragu, the one that took forty years to perfect, and turn it into a jarred supermarket sauce. A familiar, stubborn anger began to build in her chest, a heat not unlike the flame under her copper pan. This was her church, too, and he was trying to tear down the altar. “I’m not a product,” she said, her voice low and tight.

Julian stopped pacing and gave her a pitying smile. “My dear,” he said, with an air of profound patience. “On this show, everyone is a product. Your only choice is whether you want to be a bestseller or a bargain bin remainder. We’ll work on the Adele.”

The rest of the day was a systematic dismantling of everything she thought she was. The wardrobe consultant, a woman named Portia with a severe asymmetrical haircut, looked at Mia’s chosen silk shirt and jeans with utter horror. “Oh, honey, no. This is all so… Brisbane,” she’d declared, before burying Mia under an avalanche of sequins, synthetic fabrics, and shoes with heels so high they felt like a form of architectural punishment. She was poked, prodded, and measured, while Portia talked about her ‘colour story’ and ‘brand identity’. The media training was even worse. She sat in a room with Dylan and Krystal, being taught how to answer questions with pre-approved, vapid soundbites by a man who kept telling them to ‘find their truth’, which seemed to mean ‘invent a sob story’. Mia’s truth—that she loved to cook and happened to be able to sing—was deemed ‘insufficiently compelling’.

She escaped back to the hotel late that afternoon, feeling flayed and exposed. The luxurious room felt more like a cage than ever. She flopped onto the perfectly made bed, the dozen pillows mocking her with their pristine emptiness. She was a chef. She created things of substance from real ingredients. Today, she had been the ingredient, and she felt herself being rendered down into something thin, tasteless, and artificial. As she was staring at the ceiling, there was a soft knock on her door. It was Leo, holding two bottles of beer, liberated from a mini-bar down the hall.

“Figured you might be in need of some non-sponsored sustenance,” he said, his smile gentle. “I survived my session with Julian. He told me my lyrics were ‘too literary’ and asked if I could make them ‘more hashtag-friendly’.” He twisted the cap off a beer and handed it to her. The cold glass was a small, solid comfort in her hand. “It’s a factory, isn’t it?”

Mia took a long drink, the bitter hops a welcome shock to her system. “He told me Etta James was a commercial graveyard. He wants me to sing Adele.”

Leo winced in sympathy. “Oof. The full Julian experience. He tried to get me to do a Jason Mraz song. I think my guitar actually tried to leap out of my hands and end it all.” They stood in comfortable silence for a moment, looking out the vast window at the city. “You were great in there, by the way,” Leo said quietly. “I was in the studio next door. I heard you. It was… real. Don’t let him take that from you.”

His simple, unadorned compliment was the first genuine thing she had heard all day. It landed like a lifeline. “They want to turn me into a gimmick. The Singing Chef.”

“They want to turn me into the Sad Boy with a Guitar,” he sighed. “They want to turn Krystal into the Rebel Girl. Everyone gets a box. It’s easier for the cameras.” He took a sip of his beer. “The trick, I think, is to figure out how to sing what you want from inside their little box.”

Later that night, alone again, the silence of the room pressing in, she called Ben. He answered with the familiar clatter of a busy service in the background. “Verve, Chef speaking,” he barked into the phone, before realising who it was. “Oh. It’s you. How’s life as a future diva?”

“They’re trying to make me sing Adele,” she said flatly, and the simple absurdity of it, spoken aloud to someone from her real life, almost made her laugh. She explained the day, the vocal coach, the wardrobe, the media training. She expected him to laugh, to mock the whole ridiculous process. But he was quiet for a moment.

“Right,” he said, his voice serious and focused, the way it got when a supplier had sent the wrong fish. “So they’re idiots. What’s new? They’re the customer, boss. A really, really dumb customer who wants their steak cooked well-done and served with tomato sauce. You don’t argue with them. You don’t try to educate them. You smile, you say ‘great choice’, and you give them the shittiest cut of meat you have because they won’t know the difference anyway. Then you go back to your station and focus on the food for the people who actually get it.” There was a pause, a call of “Service!” in the background. “Just cook your dish, Mia. Let them put whatever stupid garnish on it they want. They can’t change what’s at the heart of it.”

His brutal, kitchen-forged pragmatism cut through her despair like a sharpened cleaver. He was right. She wasn’t a product. She was a chef. And this was just another service. A long, difficult, maddening service, but a service nonetheless. After she hung up, she walked over to her bag and took out the worn knife roll. She unrolled it on the sleek, impersonal hotel desk. The familiar shapes of her tools, her steel, were a comfort. She picked up the small paring knife, her grandfather’s knife. The wooden handle was a warm, living thing in her palm. They could put her in sequins, they could give her a hashtag, they could ask her to sing a song she hated. But they couldn't touch this. They couldn’t touch the part of her that knew how to create something real. Gripping the knife, she looked at her reflection in the dark glass of the window, the glittering, indifferent city behind her. A plan began to form, a strategy. She would smile. She would nod. She would play the game. She would let them think they were in control. And then, when the lights came up and it was her turn to sing, she would serve them the dish she wanted, soul and all. And she would make them like it.The next morning, Mia walked into the vocal studio with a new kind of armour. It wasn't defiance; it was a cool, professional poise borrowed from a thousand nights of service when everything was going wrong, the dockets were piling up, and the only way through was with a calm head and an unwavering focus on the next plate. When Julian directed her to the microphone and announced they would be working on Adele’s ‘Rolling in the Deep’, she didn’t argue. She simply nodded.

She sang the song. She hit every note with the clean, ringing precision of a tuning fork. She controlled her breathing, managed the dynamics exactly as instructed, and poured power into the chorus until the studio speakers vibrated. It was a flawless technical rendition. It was also utterly hollow. She held back the grit, the grain, the very soul of her voice, presenting Julian with a perfect, sterile copy. It was the musical equivalent of a beautifully plated but completely unseasoned dish.

Julian listened, his head cocked, a slight frown creasing his brow. "Better," he conceded when she finished. "Much cleaner. The power is focused. It’s marketable." He paused, looking at her with that unnervingly perceptive gaze. "But you're holding back. I can hear it. It’s like you’ve built a fortress around the feeling. I need you to give me a crack in the wall. Show me some 'managed vulnerability' in the second verse."

Managed vulnerability. The phrase was so absurdly corporate, so antithetical to every honest impulse she possessed, that Mia had to physically restrain a snort of laughter. It was like asking a chef to create a ‘strategically placed tear’ in a diner’s eye with a nostalgic flavour profile. She gave him a tight, professional smile. “Of course,” she said. “Managed vulnerability. I can do that.” Ben’s voice echoed in her head: *smile, say ‘great choice’, and give them the shittiest cut of meat.* She would give Julian his crack in the wall, a tiny, calculated fissure that revealed nothing of the roaring fire within.

The day continued in this vein of surreal compliance. At her wardrobe fitting, when Portia presented her with a short, tight dress covered in so many black sequins it felt like wearing a disco ball’s pelt, Mia didn’t protest. She simply stood there as Portia and her assistants pinned and tucked, discussing her ‘lines’ and the way the lights would ‘catch the shimmer’. Portia, thrilled by this newfound cooperation, declared her a ‘dream to work with’. Mia felt less like a dream and more like a mannequin, a piece of decorative meat being trussed up for display. She managed to persuade them to sew a tiny, hidden pocket on the inner seam of the dress, just big enough for a finger-length object. "For a throat lozenge," she lied, her face a mask of innocence. Portia had readily agreed, praising her professionalism.

The true test of her new strategy came during the filming of her contestant backstory package. She was led to a studio set dressed as a hyper-stylised, impossibly clean kitchen. It was all white subway tiles, gleaming copper pans that had never seen a flame, and artfully arranged bowls of perfect, plastic-looking vegetables. A cheerful young director asked her to stand at the pristine butcher block and chop a bell pepper.

"Okay, Amelia, great!" the director chirped from behind a monitor. "Now, as you chop, I want you to think about how you've always felt your voice was trapped, you know? Trapped inside this other life. You're a chef, but you're also a singer. The duality! Give me longing. Give me wistful."

Mia gripped the brand-new, perfectly balanced chef's knife they’d given her. It felt alien in her hand, a prop. She thought of her own knives, their blades worn from use, their handles shaped to her grip. She thought of Ben, probably in the thick of lunch service right now, sweating and swearing and creating something real. She looked down at the flawless, waxy red pepper and thought about the director’s request. *Give me wistful.* She took a slow, deliberate breath, let her shoulders slump just a little, and stared at the pepper as if it held all the secrets of her lost dreams. She gave them wistful. She gave them longing. She gave them a single, perfectly timed blink that she hoped looked profound on camera. Inside, she was mentally composing a recipe for roasted peppers with anchovies and garlic, her mind a million miles away in the real, chaotic, beautiful temple of Verve.

Her path crossed with Savannah’s later that day near the rehearsal rooms. The stage-school prodigy was coming out of a dance session, not a hair out of place, glowing with a faint sheen of exertion that on her looked less like sweat and more like a professionally applied highlighter. She stopped when she saw Mia.

“Still here, I see,” Savannah said, her voice dripping with condescension. “I saw your promo shoot set. Very… domestic. I’m sure the mothers of Australia will just love you.” She looked Mia up and down, her eyes lingering on Mia’s comfortable jeans and boots. “Enjoy it while it lasts. The public has a very short attention span for novelty acts.”

Mia felt the old, familiar kitchen heat rise in her chest. The urge to deliver a sharp, cutting retort was almost overwhelming. Instead, she remembered Ben’s advice. She smiled, a slow, easy smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “You’re right,” Mia said, her voice surprisingly calm. “It’s all about knowing your audience. And knowing how to handle the heat. Some things just wilt under pressure, don’t they?” She held Savannah’s gaze for a second longer than was comfortable, then walked away, leaving the other girl with a flicker of confusion on her perfect face. It was a small victory, but it tasted sweet.

Her only real moments of sanity were with Leo. They’d taken to meeting on a deserted fire escape at the back of the hotel, a small concrete ledge overlooking a grimy alleyway, a place the show’s cameras would never think to look. It became their confessional.

“They want me to wear a leather jacket and smoulder,” he said one evening, running a hand through his already messy hair in frustration. “Apparently, my natural state of ‘looking a bit tired and sad’ isn’t heroic enough. They want ‘tortured poet’, not ‘guy who needs more sleep’.”

“At least you get a jacket,” Mia countered, gesturing to her own body. “I am apparently a human glitter bomb. And Julian is still trying to get me to insert a ‘vocal cry’ into the bridge of my song. He demonstrated it. It sounded like a cat being stepped on.”

Leo laughed, a real, genuine sound that was a balm in the manufactured world they were living in. “God, a vocal cry. It’s like they have a Mad Libs for pop stars. Insert [EMOTIONAL ADJECTIVE] vocalisation here.” He grew serious, looking at her in the fading light. “So, the first live show is in two days. Are you going to give him his vocal cry?”

Mia looked out at the alley, at the real, unglamorous world of dumpsters and graffiti. “I’m going to sing the song they gave me,” she said, choosing her words carefully. “But I’m going to cook it my way. Medium rare. Not well-done.”

Leo nodded, understanding completely. “Let it bleed a little,” he murmured. “I like it.”

The day of the first live show arrived with the force of a tidal wave. The air in the studio was thick with the scent of hairspray and a collective, buzzing anxiety. Backstage was a controlled riot of producers with headsets, scurrying runners, makeup artists armed with brushes, and the ten finalists, each trapped in their own bubble of nervous energy. Mia stood in her sequined cage of a dress, feeling the familiar weight of her grandfather’s paring knife in its hidden pocket, a secret anchor in the glittering storm. Portia made a last-minute adjustment to her sleeve, tutting about a loose thread. Julian appeared at her side.

“Remember, Amelia,” he said, his voice a low, urgent whisper. “Connect with the camera. Find your vulnerability. And don’t forget the cry in the bridge. That’s your money note.”

She just nodded, her throat too tight to speak. Across the chaotic corridor, she saw Leo. He was already in his ‘tortured poet’ leather jacket, looking deeply uncomfortable. He caught her eye and gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod. *Sing it for you,* he mouthed. A wave of calm washed over her. He was right. Ben was right. Alfie was right. This wasn't for them. It wasn't for Julian or Portia or the sixteen-year-old girls they were so desperate to impress. It was for her. It was for the memory of her grandfather, for the clatter of pans in her kitchen, for the secret song she’d kept locked away for so long.

“Amelia Russo, to the stage! You’re on in thirty seconds!” a stage manager yelled, his voice tinny through his headset.

This was it. The moment of truth. She took a deep breath, expecting the chemical smell of the stage fog, but instead, for a fleeting second, she smelled garlic and butter sizzling in a hot pan. The opening note of her symphony. She walked from the dim chaos of the wings towards the blinding white circle of light waiting for her on the stage. The roar of the unseen crowd was a physical force, a wall of sound. The opening piano chords of ‘Rolling in the Deep’ began to play, crisp and clean and exactly as rehearsed. She closed her eyes. The fortress walls came down. The fire was lit. She was ready to cook.The circular spotlight felt like the searing heat of an open oven door, and for a moment, Mia was blind. The piano intro, a cascade of bright, familiar notes, echoed in the vast, dark space. She gripped the microphone stand, its cool metal a grounding force against the disorienting roar from the invisible crowd. She could feel thousands of eyes on her, feel the weight of their expectation. Julian’s words echoed in her mind: *Connect with the camera. Managed vulnerability.* She found the red light of the main camera, a single, unblinking eye, and began to sing.

The first verse was a feat of perfect obedience. Her voice was pure, strong, and utterly controlled. She sang with the precision of a surgeon, hitting every note cleanly, shaping each phrase exactly as Julian had drilled into her. It was the Adele they wanted, the flawless cover version suitable for radio play. She could picture the judges nodding along, ticking their mental boxes: pitch, check; power, check; control, check. It was technically perfect. It was also a lie. She felt like she was serving a beautiful, vibrant salad with no dressing, all colour and no flavour. As she moved into the first chorus, she could almost feel Julian’s smug satisfaction radiating from the wings. She was playing the game. She was being the good product.

Then came the second verse. The music softened slightly, and in that brief lull, Mia made her choice. This was her kitchen. She was the chef. She closed her eyes for a split second, shutting out the cameras and the judges and the weight of the show. She brought forth the memory of Alfie’s dusty conservatory, the scratch of a vinyl record, the smell of old paper and Earl Grey tea. She thought of Ben’s cynical, loyal voice on the phone: *Just cook your dish, Mia.* She took a breath, and when she sang again, the recipe had changed. A new ingredient was added: grit. A rough, bluesy texture coated the edges of the notes, a graininess that spoke of late nights and cheap beer and a heart that had been bruised a few times. It wasn't clean anymore. It was real. The fortress wall didn’t get a managed crack; she had taken a sledgehammer to it.

The shift was palpable. A ripple went through the studio audience, a subtle change in the energy. On the judges’ panel, the one known for his music industry cynicism, a formidable man named Marcus Thorne, leaned forward slightly, his bored expression replaced by one of sharp curiosity. The music began to swell, building towards the bridge, building towards the moment she was supposed to deliver her focus-grouped, pre-packaged ‘vocal cry’. She felt a surge of defiant joy. They wanted a cry. She’d give them a goddamn banshee wail. She wasn’t thinking about technique anymore; she was thinking of the searing shriek of scallops hitting a white-hot pan. It wasn’t a sound of pain, but of transformation.

As the piano chords hammered out the bridge, she didn’t just sing. She let go. The sound that tore from her throat was nothing like the polished, soaring wail Julian had coached her to produce. It was a raw, guttural, soulful roar, a sound dredged up from the deepest part of her. It was Etta James in a sequin dress. It was her grandfather’s passion and her own frustration, a blast of pure, unvarnished feeling that blasted through the studio’s perfect acoustics. It was the sound of a woman who had spent years silencing a part of herself, finally letting it scream. For a single, stunning moment, the entire song seemed to hang suspended on that one ragged, magnificent, imperfect note.

The final chorus was not a return to form. It was the aftermath of the explosion. She didn’t shout it with anger; she sang it with the searing, triumphant power of someone who had won a hard-fought battle. The final notes faded, and for two full seconds, the studio was plunged into a silence so profound it was louder than any applause. It was a silence of pure shock. Then, the dam broke. The crowd erupted, not with polite clapping, but with a visceral, standing roar of approval. It was a sound that hit her in the chest, a wave of energy so powerful it made her knees feel weak.

The host, his professional veneer momentarily shattered, trotted onto the stage, his eyes wide. “Wow,” he said, his voice regaining its composure. “Wow. Amelia Russo, everybody.” He turned to the judges, who were still processing. Savannah’s father, a slick record executive named Richard, was the first to speak. “Well, that was… a choice,” he said, a frown on his face. “There was a distinct lack of control there in the middle. It was messy.” But next to him, the resident pop princess, a young singer named Skye, was shaking her head, a massive smile on her face. “Messy? That was incredible! I have goosebumps. That was all heart. I completely forgot I was watching a competition. I just felt that.” Then it was Marcus Thorne’s turn. He stared at Mia for a long time, his expression unreadable. “For the first minute, I was bored,” he said, his voice a low gravel. “I thought, ‘here we go, another karaoke singer with a big voice.’ Then… you started to cook.” He smirked, the first glimmer of a smile she’d seen on his face. “I don’t know what that was in the middle, but it was raw, it was dangerous, and it was the most exciting thing I’ve heard on this stage all season. Don’t ever let a producer tell you to clean that up.”

As she walked off the stage, adrenaline singing in her veins, the roar of the crowd still ringing in her ears, her legs felt like jelly. She stumbled into the chaotic dimness of the backstage area and the first person she saw was Julian. His face was pale, his jaw clenched so tight a muscle jumped in his cheek. He looked at her not with pride, but with the furious, betrayed expression of a master craftsman whose apprentice had just thrown the rulebook into the fire. He said nothing, just gave her a look of cold fury before turning on his heel and storming away. A moment later, a leather-clad figure appeared at her side. It was Leo. His face was split in a wide, ecstatic grin. He didn’t speak, just grabbed her in a quick, fierce hug. “Holy hell, Russo,” he whispered in her ear. “You didn’t just cook the dish. You burned the whole damn kitchen down.” She had made her statement. She had served her soul on a platter, and they had eaten it up. But as she looked at Julian’s retreating back, she knew she hadn’t just won the crowd. She had started a war.The seconds after she left the stage were a sensory blackout. The roaring ocean of the crowd was replaced by the frantic, muffled bustle of the backstage crew. The blinding light gave way to a disorienting gloom, crisscrossed by thick black cables and hurried figures with clipboards. The adrenaline that had felt like pure fire in her veins now turned to ice, leaving her trembling, her skin cold and clammy despite the heat of the lights. The sequined dress suddenly felt heavy and abrasive, a borrowed skin she was desperate to shed. Leo was still beside her, his hand a warm, steadying presence on her elbow, guiding her through the maze towards the communal waiting area known ominously as the ‘green room’.

“Did you see Marcus Thorne’s face?” Leo was buzzing, his own nervous energy from his upcoming performance momentarily forgotten. “He looked like he’d just discovered fire. You completely sideswiped them. It was beautiful.” But as they entered the green room, a cramped space filled with wilting platters of food and tense, silent contestants, Leo’s enthusiastic whisper died in the thick atmosphere. Krystal, the pink-haired TikTok star, was staring at her phone, pointedly ignoring them. Dylan the surfer-kid gave her a wide-eyed, confused look, as if she’d just started speaking in a different language halfway through a conversation. And Savannah, who was having her makeup meticulously retouched, met Mia’s eyes in a vanity mirror. Her expression was one of pure, unadulterated venom. “That was a very desperate move,” Savannah said, her voice low and tight, meant only for Mia to hear over the hum of the air conditioning. “But I suppose when you have nothing else to offer, a gimmick is all you have left.”

Before Mia could formulate a reply, Chloe the producer swept into the room, her eyes sparkling with a predatory excitement. Mia braced herself for a reprimand, an echo of Julian’s silent fury. Instead, Chloe clapped her hands together, a general in her war room. “Okay people, listen up! That was a hell of a start! Amelia, you’ve lit up the switchboards. The social media team is going ballistic. It’s chaos, it’s drama, the public is eating it up!” She beamed at Mia, a shark’s smile. “It was insubordinate, unprofessional, and completely off-brief. Do it again next week.” The sheer, naked cynicism of the statement left Mia momentarily speechless. It wasn’t about art, or soul, or even commercial appeal. It was about creating noise. She hadn't burned the kitchen down; she had just provided an unexpected pyrotechnics display for the dinner show, and the management was delighted with the spectacle.

While the other contestants were called one by one to perform, Mia found a quiet corner and pulled out her phone, her hands still shaking slightly. She had one missed call and a string of frantic texts from Alfie. She dialled his number. He answered before the first ring had finished. “AMELIA!” he bellowed, the sound so loud she had to pull the phone away from her ear. “That wasn’t a song, my girl, that was an exorcism! It was glorious! It was a masterpiece of controlled demolition! I haven’t felt like that since I saw The Who smash their instruments at Monterey! Your grandfather would have stood on his chair and cheered!” Hearing his unadulterated joy, his complete understanding of not just what she did, but why she did it, was like a gulp of clean, fresh air. It cleared the hairspray and the cynicism from her lungs. This was the feedback that mattered. This was her real judge.

Her moment of peace was shattered by a low, furious voice at her shoulder. “You think you’re clever, don’t you?” It was Julian. He had cornered her, his body blocking her into the corner, his face pale with rage under the harsh fluorescent lights. “You think that was a victory? That was the most arrogant, self-indulgent display I have ever witnessed on a professional stage.” His voice was a venomous whisper, more chilling than any shout. “You didn’t just defy my instruction. You spat in the face of a process designed to make you successful. That one little trick, that flash of ‘authenticity’, might get you through a round. But it’s not a career. It’s a cheap firework. It burns bright and then it’s gone. You’ve shown everyone you’re unmanageable. Un-pro-duce-able. No serious person in this industry will want to touch you after a stunt like that. You haven't started a war, Amelia. You’ve just written your own suicide note.” He stared at her, his sharp eyes filled with a deep, personal contempt, before turning and striding away, leaving his words to hang in the air like poison.

His attack struck a deeper, more vulnerable nerve than Savannah’s petty jealousy or Chloe’s cynical praise. Julian’s words tapped into her deepest fear: not that she would fail, but that she was a fraud. A chef playing dress-up, a novelty act who had gotten lucky, a woman whose passion was, as he put it, just a cheap firework. The self-doubt came rushing back in, cold and overwhelming. She felt the weight of her thirty-two years, her mortgage, the restaurant she had left in Ben’s hands. What was she doing here? Had she just torched her one, improbable chance for a foolish, emotional display that meant nothing to anyone but her and an eccentric old man in Brisbane? The rest of the show passed in a blur of anxiety. Leo’s performance was beautiful, a quiet, intricate web of melody and melancholy that was the polar opposite of her emotional explosion. She barely registered the other songs, her mind replaying Julian’s words over and over.

Finally, it was time. The host’s chipper voice called them all back to the stage for the verdict. Lined up under the hot lights, the roar of the crowd felt different now, less like approval and more like the sound of lions in a coliseum waiting to be fed. The fake smiles were plastered on every face. Mia stood between Leo, who gave her hand a quick, reassuring squeeze, and a trembling Krystal. The host began the ritual, drawing out the suspense with practiced ease. “The first person safe tonight, and heading into next week, is… Leo!” A wave of relief, followed by more names. Dylan. Skye, one of the judges’ favourites. The numbers on stage dwindled. Soon there were only four of them left. Mia’s heart hammered against her ribs. Then three. Her, Savannah, and a quiet boy-band refugee named Matt. “The final person guaranteed a spot in our top nine is…” The host paused, his eyes sweeping across their terrified faces. “Savannah.” Savannah’s mask of composure cracked for a second in a flash of pure relief, before re-forming into a smug, triumphant smile she shot directly at Mia. Now it was just her and Matt. The chef and the pop-star washout. Standing side-by-side, waiting for the axe to fall. The cheap firework, about to be extinguished.The host’s voice was a slick, synthetic instrument, playing a tune of manufactured suspense. “Two incredible artists. One difficult decision. But the decision is not ours to make. It is in the hands of the Australian public.” He let the words hang in the air, a verbal guillotine poised over their heads. “Matt, Amelia, whatever happens tonight, you should both be incredibly proud.” The platitude was so meaningless it was insulting. Mia’s gaze was fixed on a point in the blackness beyond the stage, her mind a frantic, repeating loop of Julian’s parting words: *suicide note, suicide note, suicide note.* She braced for the impact, for the polite dismissal, for the long, lonely flight back to Brisbane with her tail between her legs, a novelty act whose fifteen minutes had just expired.

“The public has voted,” the host continued, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. “The final person staying with us on Australia’s Aria is…” The pause stretched into an eternity. Mia could hear the frantic pounding of her own heart, a sound far more familiar now than the sizzle of shallots. She saw Matt beside her, his young face pale and frozen in a mask of desperate hope. “Mia.” The name was a clean, sharp crack in the silence. For a second, it didn’t register. It felt like a word from a different language. Then the crowd noise hit her, a physical wall of sound, and Matt was turning to her, his own disappointment instantly masked by a practiced, gracious smile as he wrapped her in a brief, stiff hug. “Congratulations,” he whispered, his voice cracking, and then he was gone, swallowed by the host and the sympathetic camera shots. Mia stood alone in the centre of the stage, rooted to the spot, a lone survivor on a glittering battlefield. She managed to stammer a thank you to the camera, a choked, incoherent string of words directed at the faceless public who had, for reasons she couldn't comprehend, thrown her a lifeline.

The moment she was off-stage, the fragile dam of her composure broke. She was steered through the backstage labyrinth, past a devastated Matt being consoled by his family, and past Savannah, who swept by with her entourage, her face a thundercloud of fury that she had been forced to share even a moment of peril with "the chef." Chloe intercepted her before she could escape, her eyes alight with the thrill of a successful gamble. “That’s television, darling!” she crowed, grabbing Mia’s arms. “They love an underdog! They love a fighter! My phone has not stopped buzzing. The network is ecstatic.” There was no warmth in her congratulations, only the cold calculus of ratings and engagement metrics. Chloe saw her not as a person, but as a trending topic, a volatile stock that had just paid out. Mia pulled away, muttering an excuse, and fled, desperate for air that wasn't thick with the scent of ambition and hairspray.

She found her way to the fire escape, their small, unofficial sanctuary. The cold metal railing was a shock against her clammy hands, and the grimy city air, smelling of rain and exhaust fumes, felt cleaner than anything in the studio. She leaned her head against the cool brick wall, the adrenaline crash leaving her hollowed out and trembling. She didn't feel triumphant. She felt like she had just survived a car crash, dazed and disoriented, unsure of the extent of her injuries. A moment later, the fire door creaked open and Leo slipped out, closing it softly behind him. He didn’t say anything at first, just leaned against the railing beside her, giving her space to breathe. The quiet camaraderie was more comforting than any effusive praise. “You okay?” he finally asked, his voice low.

“I have no idea,” she confessed, her own voice sounding thin and reedy. “Julian told me I wrote my own professional suicide note tonight. Chloe told me to do it again next week. Savannah looked at me like I’d just poisoned her water supply. And a judge I’ve never met said I ‘started to cook’. I feel like I just got five different reviews for a dish I’m not even sure I made correctly.” She laughed, a shaky, humourless sound. “What the hell just happened, Leo?” He looked at her, his expression serious in the dim glow of the security light. “What happened is you broke the machine,” he said. “Just for a second. You did something they didn’t script and couldn’t predict. Julian and Savannah are angry because you broke the rules they live by. Chloe is happy because breaking the rules makes good TV. And the public… the public voted for the real thing. They voted for the person, not the product.” He nudged her gently with his shoulder. “That makes you the most dangerous person in the competition, Russo. They can’t control you, but they can’t get rid of you either. It’s a hell of a place to be.”

Later, after the whirlwind of post-show interviews where she was coached to talk about her ‘emotional journey’, she finally made it back to the sterile silence of her hotel room. She ignored the congratulatory fruit basket from the network and dialled Ben’s number. He answered with a weary grunt. The familiar background noise of Verve’s end-of-service cleanup—the clang of steel buckets, the hiss of hot water, the low murmur of tired staff—was the most beautiful music she’d ever heard. “You’re not eliminated, then,” he stated, his version of a warm greeting. “I saw it on the pub TV next door. You looked like you were about to either burst into tears or punch the host. It was pretty good.”

“It was a mess, Ben,” she sighed, sinking onto the edge of the bed. “I went completely off-script. The vocal coach hates me. The other contestants think I’m a joke. I’m pretty sure I’m the producer’s new favourite science experiment.” There was a pause on the other end, just the sound of a mop hitting a floor. “Right,” he said, his voice dropping into its familiar, pragmatic tone. “So, you did exactly what you were supposed to do. You made your dish, your way. They didn’t like the recipe, but the customers ordered a second helping. Sounds like a successful service to me. Stop thinking like a singer, boss. Think like a chef. Your next job is to figure out how to put the same dish on the menu next week, maybe with a different name, so the idiots in charge don’t see it coming.” He paused. “Now, stop worrying about the karaoke competition. I need to know if you signed off on the invoice for the Dutch carrots, because they’ve shorted us two kilos and I’m about to go to war with the supplier.” The abrupt shift back to their world, to the tangible reality of profit margins and root vegetables, was the anchor she desperately needed. It was a reminder that the glittering, toxic world of the show was not her only reality. She had a kingdom to go back to.

After the call, she unrolled her knives on the polished hotel desk, the worn leather and familiar steel a stark contrast to the room’s bland luxury. She picked up her grandfather's paring knife, its weight a familiar comfort in her palm. Leo was right; she was in a dangerous position. Ben was right; she needed a strategy. Julian’s words about a cheap firework still stung, a shard of ice in her gut. He might be right. This might be a fleeting, foolish victory. But as she looked at her reflection in the dark blade of the knife, she saw the same stubborn glint in her eyes that she saw in Alfie’s. She hadn’t just survived. She’d been given a mandate, not from the judges or the producers, but from the darkness beyond the stage lights. They had tasted something real, and they wanted more. Her job now was to keep cooking. And she would not be serving them what was on the menu. She would serve them the chef’s special, every single time. The war wasn't over. The kitchen had just opened for a whole new service.The morning after the live show was like the dead, silent hour in the kitchen after a brutal Saturday night service. The adrenaline was gone, leaving behind a dull ache and a low, humming exhaustion. When Mia walked into the hotel’s breakfast room, the atmosphere was palpably different. The day before, she had been a background character, the slightly-too-old chef who had slipped in through a side door. Today, she was the main event. Conversations stopped. Heads turned. She was no longer invisible; she was a specimen under glass, and the other contestants were a mixture of resentful rivals and wary observers. Krystal offered a hesitant half-smile, while Dylan seemed to actively shrink away as she passed. The only person who met her eye was Leo, who gave a quiet nod from his table, a silent acknowledgement of their shared reality.

The true shift in her status became apparent in the first production meeting of the week. Last week, she had been an afterthought. This week, she was seated at the main table, directly opposite Chloe and a grim-faced Julian. Chloe was practically vibrating with energy, tapping a pen against a stack of social media analytics reports. “Okay, team. Week two. The theme is ‘Rock Anthems’. We’re talking stadium-fillers, legends, big energy.” She slid a piece of paper across the table to Mia. “And for our resident fire-starter…” Mia looked down. Printed in bold letters were the words: ‘Black Dog – Led Zeppelin’.

It was a trap, and a clever one at that. They had heard her Zeppelin reference to Ben. They were taking her casual kitchen joke and turning it into a public challenge. After her raw, emotional performance, they were throwing her a song defined by masculine bravado, screeching guitars, and Robert Plant’s almost superhuman vocal swagger. It was a setup. They expected one of two outcomes: either she would crash and burn, proving she was a one-trick pony who couldn’t handle a different genre, or she would simply shout her way through it, reinforcing the ‘wild, uncontrollable screamer’ narrative they were now so keen to sell. It was a box, just a different shape from the last one.

“Big song,” Mia said, her voice carefully neutral. She could feel Julian’s eyes on her, waiting for her to object, to refuse, to give him the opening he needed to declare her unprofessional once again.
“It’s your brand now, darling,” Chloe purred. “Raw power. We lean into it. The voting public wants the fighter. So we give them a prize fight.” Julian remained silent, but a small, tight smile played on his lips. It was a smile that said, *Go on. I dare you.* It was a challenge to a duel, and he had just handed her a cannon, knowing full well she had no idea how to fire it.

That evening on the fire escape, Leo whistled low when she told him the song choice. “Zeppelin. Wow. They really are just throwing you into the deep end of the pool to see if you’ll come up with a shark.” He took a thoughtful sip of his beer. “So what’s the play? You can’t do the same thing you did last week. You can’t just bleed all over a Zeppelin song. It’ll swallow you whole.” He was right. Her previous performance had been an act of deconstruction, tearing down a polished pop song to find the raw emotion beneath. But ‘Black Dog’ was already raw. It was a solid wall of sound and fury. Trying to scream louder than Zeppelin was a fool’s errand.

The answer, as it always did, came from the kitchen. She called Ben late that night, the noise of his own end-of-service world a comforting roar in her ear. “They gave me Zeppelin,” she said, skipping the preamble. “They’re trying to make me into a caricature.” She heard him sigh, a sound of weary frustration. “Right. So the customer who liked the spicy dish last week has now demanded you serve them a whole ghost chili on a plate. It’s a dick move. A test.” “So what do I do?” Mia asked, pacing the length of her soulless room. “I can’t just yell my way through it.” “Of course you can’t,” Ben said, his voice sharp with kitchen logic. “That’s what they expect. You don’t cook a delicate piece of fish the same way you cook a brisket. This isn’t about heat, Mia. This is about flavour. What’s the song about, underneath all the shouting and the guitars?” She stopped pacing. It was a simple question, but one she hadn't let herself ask. She’d been so focused on the sound, on the trap, that she hadn't considered the substance. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Heartbreak? Lust? Longing for someone you can’t have?” “There you go,” Ben said, his voice softening slightly. “So don’t serve them the whole damn chili. Serve them the flavour of the chili. Find the heart of the brisket. Break it down. You’re a chef, for Christ’s sake. Butcher the thing properly.”

Butcher the thing properly. The phrase echoed in her mind as she walked into her vocal session with Julian the next day. He was standing by the piano, his arms crossed, the picture of smug authority. “Well,” he began, without greeting. “Are you ready to embarrass yourself with one of the most iconic rock songs ever recorded?” Mia didn’t answer. She walked past him to the pianist, a talented but perpetually nervous young man named Alex. “Alex,” she said quietly. “Can you lose the sheet music? Just give me the basic chord progression. Really simple. Arpeggiated. And in a lower key. Let’s start in C-sharp minor.” Alex looked at Julian, terrified, but Mia held his gaze. “Please,” she said, her voice soft but firm. Reluctantly, Alex nodded. Julian watched, his expression shifting from smugness to confusion.

Mia took a breath and began to sing. But she didn’t sing ‘Black Dog’. She dissected it. She ignored the swagger and the strut, and instead, she found the desperate, pleading question at its core. *“Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move / Gon' make you sweat, gon' make you groove.”* In her voice, it wasn’t a confident boast; it was a quiet, mournful observation. She treated Plant’s iconic call-and-response vocals not as a rock-god proclamation, but as a fractured internal monologue, the voice of a man arguing with his own obsession. She stripped away the bravado and found the blues ballad hiding underneath. It was vulnerable, intimate, and utterly unexpected. When she finished the first verse, the studio was silent. Alex, the pianist, was staring at his hands as if he’d never seen them before. Julian’s face was a mask of thunderous disbelief. “What was that?” he finally bit out. “That was not the song.” “That was the recipe,” Mia replied calmly, meeting his furious gaze without flinching. “Those are the ingredients. I’m just preparing them differently.” “This is an act of artistic sabotage!” he hissed. “The theme is Rock Anthems, not tortured coffee-house dirges! You are deliberately defying the entire premise of the week!” “No,” Mia said, a newfound strength solidifying in her core. “I’m interpreting it. You wanted me to cook. This is how I cook.” She had found her new weapon. It wasn’t defiance. It was reinterpretation. It was a move he couldn’t fight on technical grounds, and it drove him into a silent, simmering rage for the rest of the session. She had taken his cannon and turned it into a scalpel.The week leading up to the second live show was a quiet, cold war. Julian stopped speaking to Mia directly, instead relaying his clipped, sarcastic notes through the terrified pianist, Alex. “Mr. Croft suggests you might want to consider breathing at some point during the song, if it’s not too much of an artistic imposition,” Alex would stammer, refusing to meet her eye. Mia simply nodded, accepted the technical note, and ignored the venom it was delivered with. She spent her hours in the studio not fighting, but refining. With Alex as her willing accomplice, they worked on the arrangement, turning it from a simple deconstruction into a complex and layered piece of music. They slowed the tempo even further, creating a tense, swampy groove. They found a dark, mournful harmony for the chorus and turned the iconic guitar riff into a haunting, repeating piano motif. She wasn't just butchering the song anymore; she was curing it, aging it, drawing out flavours no one else knew were there.

Her new approach created ripples throughout the production. The choreography session was a farce. The dance captain, used to planning explosive rock-star moves, watched her slow, intense rehearsal and threw his hands up in despair. “What am I supposed to do with this? She just… stands there. And emotes! It’s an anthem, not a eulogy!” The wardrobe department was equally baffled. Her black sequin dress from the week before was retired, and Portia, after a tense conversation with Chloe, presented her with a simple, floor-length gown of dark velvet. It was elegant and severe, the costume of a tragic opera heroine, not a rock star. “Chloe’s calling it ‘Gothic Glamour’,” Portia sniffed, clearly disapproving of the lack of sparkle. “I call it a funeral shroud.”

In this new, isolated space she had carved for herself, her only real ally remained Leo. Their fire-escape meetings became more crucial than ever. He was her only link to the shared reality of the competition, the only one who saw the full picture. “It’s weird in there now,” he told her one evening, gesturing back towards the hotel. “Since your Zeppelin thing, everyone’s on edge. Savannah’s been working on a power ballad with so many vocal runs it sounds like an Olympic gymnastics routine. Krystal is trying to be ‘edgy’, but she just looks angry. You’ve spooked the herd. They all think they need a gimmick now, too.” He shook his head, a wry smile on his face. “You haven’t just broken the machine, Russo. You’ve reprogrammed it. And the other robots are glitching.”

A phone call with Alfie provided a different perspective. When she tried to explain the arrangement, the risk, the quiet hostility she was facing, he simply chuckled. “My dear Amelia, you are discovering the great secret of all true artists. You are not there to give the people what they want. You are there to tell them what they need. You have found the sad story hiding in the loud man’s shouting. It is a brave and a beautiful thing to do. Now, stop worrying and sing the poor fellow’s story for him.”

The night of the live show, the backstage atmosphere was thick with a new kind of tension. Last week, it had been a general, unfocused anxiety. Tonight, it was targeted. All eyes were on Mia. The whispers followed her as she walked to her dressing room. She was the wild card, the saboteur, the one who wasn't playing the game. She felt the weight of their resentment, their fear, and their professional jealousy. But for the first time, she didn't feel like an imposter. Dressed in the severe velvet gown, her hair pulled back simply, she felt less like a pop star in costume and more like a chef in her proper uniform, ready for service. Her grandfather’s paring knife was a cold, familiar line of steel in its hidden pocket. She was calm. She was ready.

When her name was called, she walked towards the stage with a steady, deliberate pace. The set was dark, bathed in a low, smoky blue light. A single stool stood in the center of the stage next to a grand piano where Alex was already seated, his knuckles white. There were no flashing lights, no pyrotechnics. The silence from the crowd was immediate, a heavy blanket of confused expectation. They had come for a rock anthem. The stark, intimate staging was a promise of something else entirely. Mia didn't look for the cameras. She looked at Alex, gave him a small, almost imperceptible nod, and he began to play.

The familiar riff of ‘Black Dog’, when it came from the piano, was almost unrecognizable. It was slow, melancholic, a ghost of the original. Mia sat on the stool, her hands resting in her lap, and when she began to sing, her voice was a near-whisper. It was intimate, confessional, drawing the audience of thousands into the tiny, private space she was creating. She sang of obsession not with a roar, but with a quiet, weary ache. She turned Robert Plant’s rock-and-roll swagger into the desperate, hollow plea of a man haunted by a love he could neither hold nor escape. The power was still there, but she held it back, letting it simmer beneath the surface, a dangerous heat the audience could feel but not see. The performance was a masterclass in tension, a slow-burn reduction of a song until only its most potent, concentrated flavour remained.

When the final, mournful piano chord faded into the vast studio, the silence that followed was different from the week before. It wasn’t the silence of shock. It was the silence of captivation. It was the quiet reverence a congregation gives a powerful sermon. For a long moment, no one moved. Then, Marcus Thorne started to clap. Not loudly, but a slow, deliberate, rhythmic applause. Soon, the rest of the judging panel joined him, and then the entire studio, not in a wild roar, but in a wave of sustained, respectful applause.

The host walked out, his usual chipper energy toned down, as if he, too, felt the need for reverence. He turned to the judges. Richard, Savannah’s father, looked deeply uncomfortable. “I… honestly don’t know what to say,” he stammered. “The theme was Rock Anthems. That wasn’t rock and roll. It was an interesting artistic experiment, but it completely missed the brief.” Skye, the pop princess, was wiping a tear from her eye. “I have to disagree. That was so… sexy. In the saddest, most heartbreaking way. It was brave, and it was beautiful, and I could not look away.”

Finally, all eyes turned to Marcus Thorne. He leaned back in his chair, a look of deep satisfaction on his face, like a food critic who had just been served a perfect, unexpected dish. “Last week,” he began, his gravelly voice silencing the room, “I said you started to cook. Tonight, you showed us you’re a master distiller. You took a bottle of cheap, loud whiskey, and you boiled it down until you found one single, perfect, heartbreaking drop of pure alcohol. I’ve heard that song a thousand times. I’ve never actually *listened* to it until tonight. That, Amelia, was not just a performance. It was a revelation.”

As she walked off the stage, the weight of his words settling on her, she felt a profound, quiet sense of victory that was a world away from the chaotic survival of the week before. She passed Julian in the wings. He stood with his arms crossed, his face a stone mask. He had no words for her, no fury left. He simply looked defeated, a man whose entire rulebook had just been rendered obsolete. In that moment, Mia knew she wasn’t just a singer in a competition anymore. She was an interpreter. She had found her voice by using it to find the hidden voices in others’ songs. And she knew, with a certainty that chilled and thrilled her to the bone, that the game had changed for good.The walk back to the green room was a disorienting journey through a new country where she was suddenly the reigning monarch. The frenetic energy backstage parted for her like the Red Sea. Crew members who had barely noticed her existence now offered nods of respect. Krystal, the pink-haired TikToker, looked at her with wide, terrified eyes, as if Mia had just performed an act of genuine magic. The air was no longer thick with resentment; it had been replaced by a far more isolating emotion: awe. Leo met her at the door, his face a mixture of wonder and profound relief for her. He simply shook his head, speechless, and clapped her on the shoulder, a gesture that conveyed everything. The only island of unchanged hostility in the room was Savannah. She was standing with her father, Richard, her perfect posture rigid with fury. As Mia passed, Savannah’s voice, a blade of ice, cut through the quiet. “Bravo,” she said, her smile a terrifying baring of teeth. “You’ve successfully convinced them that a funeral dirge is a rock song. A remarkable feat of deception.”

Chloe found her moments later, her professional cool having melted into undisguised glee. She was no longer a producer managing a contestant; she was a stockbroker who had just watched a long-shot investment go stratospheric. “The Alchemist! That’s what the blogs are calling you already! Marcus’s ‘distiller’ line is gold, pure gold!” she gushed, holding up her phone to show Mia the exploding social media feed. “We’re ditching the ‘Singing Chef’ narrative. It’s too small. You’re ‘The Interpreter’ now. It’s smarter. More prestigious. It sells to a better demographic.” Chloe was rebranding her on the fly, her words a rapid-fire marketing brief. Mia realised with a cold jolt that she hadn’t escaped her box. She had just been moved into a more luxurious, gilded cage, one with a fancier label on the door.

The phone call to Ben later that night was a study in mismatched realities. She reached him during the final dregs of cleanup, the familiar clatter of stacked plates and the rhythmic squeak of a mop providing a soundtrack from a different life. He had already seen the performance. “Yeah, it was good,” he said, his voice flat with exhaustion. “You didn’t yell. Smart. So, the new apprentice, Jamie, tried to use the mandoline without the guard again. I swear to god, I’m going to superglue the thing to his hand. We’re out of coagulant pads.” The whiplash was jarring. She had just reshaped a rock anthem on national television, and Ben was talking about a clumsy apprentice and a shortage of industrial-strength bandages. A chasm was opening between her two worlds, and for the first time, she felt a profound, aching loneliness from the Brisbane side of the divide. The kitchen, her tangible reality, was moving on without her, its daily crises and triumphs utterly indifferent to her glittering, televised fantasy.

Her fire-escape debrief with Leo felt different, too. The easy camaraderie was still there, but it was now threaded with the undeniable reality of their positions. They were no longer just two bewildered outsiders; they were two of the strongest contenders, heading on a collision course. “You did it again, Russo,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief as he leaned against the cold brick. “But this was different. Last week was a protest. Tonight was a thesis. You’re not just breaking the rules anymore; you’re rewriting the textbook.” He paused, looking out over the grimy alleyway. “I have to go on after you next week. How am I supposed to follow that? Sing a nice song on my guitar? It’s going to feel like bringing a folk ballad to a cannon fight.” The compliment was heavy, unintentionally isolating her even further. She was no longer part of the group. She had become the standard, a benchmark against which everyone else was now being measured.

The next morning, the media had canonised her. The narrative Chloe had predicted was everywhere. Headlines dubbed her ‘The Alchemist of Aria’, ‘The Song Whisperer’. They praised her ‘musical intelligence’ and ‘fearless artistry’. It was intoxicating and terrifying. The freedom of being the underdog, the scrappy chef with nothing to lose, was gone. In its place was the crushing weight of expectation. Last week, she had surprised them. Tonight, she had stunned them. What could she possibly do next week? How many revelations could one person possibly have? The new label, ‘The Interpreter’, felt less like a compliment and more like a high-wire, with no safety net and an audience that was now waiting, not to see her fly, but to see if she would fall. The pressure was a physical thing, a tightening in her chest that the sterile air of the hotel room did nothing to alleviate.

She was contemplating this new, terrifying reality when a sharp knock came at her door. It was Savannah. She wasn’t wearing her usual polished armour; her hair was pulled back in a simple ponytail, and she was in workout clothes, a faint sheen of sweat on her brow. She looked less like a pageant queen and more like a predator. She didn't wait for an invitation, pushing past Mia into the room. “I want you to understand something,” Savannah began, her voice low and devoid of its usual performative sweetness. “I’ve watched you. You’ve got a good story. The humble chef, the raw talent. It’s cute. And your little parlor tricks, turning songs inside out, it’s clever. The judges love it. The public loves it. For now.” She took a step closer, her eyes boring into Mia’s. “But this isn’t a talent show, Amelia. It’s a war of attrition. It’s about who can handle the pressure week after week, who can do the interviews, the choreography, the seventeen-hour days, and still deliver a flawless performance on command. I was born for this. This is just a Tuesday for me. For you, it’s the fight of your life. And you are going to get tired. You are going to crack. And when you do, I will be there to take what is rightfully mine.” She held Mia's gaze for a heartbeat longer, a silent declaration of war, then turned and walked out, leaving the door wide open behind her.Savannah’s departure left a vacuum in the room, a pocket of charged, still air where her scent of expensive perfume and ambition had been. The open door was an insult, a final, casual gesture of dominance. Mia walked over and closed it, the soft click of the latch sounding unnervingly final. She leaned her forehead against the cool wood, her fortress of a hotel room suddenly feeling like the smallest, most confining space in the world. A war of attrition. The phrase was perfectly chosen, a piece of strategic genius designed to bypass all of Mia’s defences and strike directly at her most vulnerable point: her stamina. Savannah wasn't questioning her talent; she was questioning her substance. She was framing the competition not as a series of creative sprints, but as a brutal marathon, a soul-crushing endurance test for which Mia had never trained. Every long day, every fake smile, every moment of homesickness would now be viewed through that lens. It wasn’t just a competition anymore; it was a siege, and Savannah had just announced she had endless supplies while Mia was already running on fumes.

The next production meeting confirmed the new world order. The theme for the week was ‘Personal Anthems’, and Chloe announced it with the air of a benevolent queen bestowing gifts upon her subjects. When she came to Mia, her smile was particularly bright, particularly predatory. “And for our Alchemist,” she said, her voice dripping with manufactured significance, “we thought we’d give you something truly personal. A song we know is close to your heart.” She slid a sheet of paper across the table. Mia’s blood ran cold when she saw the title. ‘A Case of You’ – Joni Mitchell. The song she had been humming in her kitchen, the song she had mentioned to Ben in what felt like another lifetime. They had been listening. They had been taking notes. They were strip-mining her life for content. It wasn’t a gift; it was a violation. They were taking something that belonged to the quiet, private world of her kitchen and forcing it onto their glittering, public stage.

“A beautiful choice, don’t you think?” Chloe pressed, her eyes searching Mia’s for a reaction she could use. “A chance for Australia to see the heart behind the artist.” Julian, seated at the far end of the table, watched her over his steepled fingers, his face a blank canvas of contempt. He knew exactly what this was: a trap. They were asking her to interpret the uninterpretable, a song that was already a perfect statement of vulnerability. More than that, they were testing her. After her grand, public reinventions of other artists, could she stand to simply be herself? Or was ‘The Interpreter’ just another role, another mask? She felt a wave of nausea. She looked at the paper, at the title of a song she loved, and for the first time, she felt a flicker of hatred for it. “It’s a great song,” she said, her voice a carefully controlled monotone, giving them nothing.

Her vocal sessions with Julian descended into a new circle of hell. His overt hostility was replaced by something far more corrosive: weaponized apathy. He would sit in the corner of the studio, scrolling through his phone, offering no guidance, no critique, no feedback whatsoever. His silence was a constant, screaming accusation. When Mia, working with Alex at the piano, tried to find a way into the song, Julian would occasionally look up and offer a piece of poison wrapped in a compliment. “The network loves your artistic process, Amelia,” he drawled one afternoon. “This is precisely the kind of navel-gazing authenticity that tests well with the target demographic. Please, continue.” He was refusing to engage, forcing her into a position of total creative isolation, content to watch from the sidelines as she struggled with the impossible task they had set her.

Savannah’s prophecy began to haunt her. The war of attrition was real. The schedule was relentless, a blur of early morning vocal warm-ups, mid-day choreography sessions (for a song she would perform sitting still), and afternoon interviews with perky entertainment reporters who all asked the same three questions. “What’s the secret to being ‘The Alchemist’?” one asked, microphone thrust in her face. “It’s just about listening,” Mia heard herself say, the words sounding hollow and rehearsed even to her own ears. She felt her energy fraying, her patience thinning. Her temper, usually contained by the disciplined heat of the kitchen, flared at small provocations. She snapped at a runner who brought her the wrong kind of tea. She found herself staring out the window during a wardrobe fitting, her mind a complete blank, until Portia’s insistent voice dragged her back. She was tired. A deep, soul-level weariness that had nothing to do with a lack of sleep. She was tired of the artifice, of the performance, of her own face staring back at her from tabloid magazines.

The chasm between her life in Sydney and her home in Brisbane was becoming a vast, unbridgeable canyon. She called Alfie, hoping his eccentric wisdom could offer some comfort. “They’ve given me Joni, Alfie,” she said. “A Case of You.” He was ecstatic. “Your kitchen song! Oh, it’s a sign from the universe, my girl! It is the universe telling you to simply sing your own truth!” “But it doesn’t feel like my truth anymore, Alfie,” she tried to explain, the frustration making her voice tight. “It feels like they’ve stolen it. They’re using it as a prop in their show.” There was a pause. “My dear,” he said gently, “a story is only a prop if you let it be. They can’t steal the feeling behind the words. That belongs to you.” His faith was beautiful and absolute, but it felt a world away from the cold, hard reality of the television studio. He saw a spiritual journey; she saw a cynical marketing ploy.

Her struggle with the song became a creative crisis. ‘A Case of You’ was already perfect. It was pure. Trying to deconstruct it felt like vandalism. Trying to sing it straight felt like blasphemous karaoke. In the sterile rehearsal room, late at night, she sang it over and over, her voice growing hoarse, her frustration mounting. Each time, it sounded weak, derivative, a faint echo of Joni Mitchell’s genius. She felt naked, exposed, stripped of the armour of reinterpretation she had so carefully constructed. The Alchemist had run out of tricks. The pressure mounted until she felt she was suffocating. One night, sitting alone at the piano, she played the opening chords and sang the first line, but her voice cracked, and a wave of hopeless frustration washed over her. She slammed her hands down on the keys, the discordant clang echoing in the empty room, and buried her face in her hands. She had nothing.

The door creaked open. Mia looked up, expecting a janitor or a security guard, and saw Krystal hesitating on the threshold. The pink-haired girl looked uncertain, her usual bravado gone. “Sorry,” she mumbled, about to retreat. “No, it’s fine,” Mia said, wiping her eyes, embarrassed to be seen so raw. Krystal lingered. “I just… I wanted to say… that Zeppelin thing you did,” she started, her voice barely a whisper. “It was… I dunno. It made me download the whole album. I’d never really listened to them before. It made me remember why I started singing, you know? Before all this crap.” She gestured vaguely around the empty room, at the invisible machinery of the show. “Anyway. Sorry to bother you.” And then she was gone, a fleeting, genuine moment in a world of artifice.

Krystal’s words were a small, sharp pinprick of light in Mia’s despair. She had made someone listen. She had shared not just a performance, but a piece of music she loved. It wasn’t about the judges, or the producers, or the game. It was about the song. And suddenly, she understood. Alfie was right. They couldn’t steal the feeling. And Ben was right. She had to think like a chef. The problem wasn’t the ingredient; it was her approach. She had been trying to change the song, to put her stamp on it. But this song didn't need changing. It needed to be inhabited. She didn't need to deconstruct it; she needed to pour herself into it. The interpretation would not be in the notes, but in the intent. She wouldn't be singing it as a woman in love with a man. She would sing it as a high priestess singing a hymn to her one true temple. It was a love song to her kitchen. To the sizzle of the shallots, the searing heat, the controlled chaos. To the craft that had sustained her, that had defined her, that she could drink a case of and still be on her feet. This was her real love story.

A profound calm settled over her. She knew what she had to do. She wasn't going on stage to fight Savannah, or to please Chloe, or to spite Julian. She was going on stage to make a confession of faith. The risk was immense, because this time, she wasn't hiding behind an interpretation. She was laying her own soul bare, serving it up on a plate for the entire country to judge. And she was finally ready to let them taste it.The discovery was not a thunderclap but a quiet dawn. It did not bring with it a surge of defiant energy, but a profound and settling calm. The war of attrition Savannah had declared was predicated on Mia fighting an external battle, a siege against the show’s machinery. But Mia’s breakthrough had moved the conflict inward and, in doing so, had ended it. She wasn't fighting them anymore. She was simply going to cook. In the final rehearsal, she walked into the studio and found a nervous Alex waiting by the piano. She didn’t have any notes for him, no requests for a key change or a different tempo. She simply looked at him and said, “Play it straight. Just as Joni wrote it. I’ll follow you.” Confused but relieved, Alex began to play the song’s iconic, tumbling introduction on the dulcimer sound setting of his keyboard.

When Mia began to sing, Alex almost stopped playing. The voice was the same, but the intention was completely transformed. There was no artifice, no clever reinterpretation, no attempt to put a spin on the melody. She just sang, her eyes closed, a faint, private smile on her lips. But the love she sang of was not for a person. When she sang, “I’m a lonely painter, I live in a box of paints,” she was not in a hotel room in Sydney, but standing in her pantry at Verve, surrounded by the earthy colours of spices, the deep greens of herbs, the vibrant reds of chilies. When the lyric came, “I could drink a case of you, darling, and I’d still be on my feet,” it was a hymn to the endless, intoxicating challenge of her craft, the thing that could exhaust her but never defeat her. She was not performing a song; she was testifying. When she finished, Alex didn’t speak. He just looked at her, his eyes shining with unshed tears, and nodded. He understood. He had not just accompanied a singer; he had been granted access to a private prayer.

On the night of the live show, a strange peace settled over Mia. While other contestants paced nervously, running scales and adjusting their immaculately styled outfits, Mia sat quietly in her dressing room, her hands resting in her lap. The gown they had given her was a simple column of deep blue silk, elegant and unadorned. It felt like her own skin. Portia had fussed, suggesting a statement necklace or shimmering earrings, but Mia had gently refused. Tonight, there would be no armour, no sequins, no distractions. She was serving the dish un-garnished. As she waited, Savannah appeared in the doorway, a vision in diamond-white, her hair a marvel of sculpted perfection. She surveyed Mia’s tranquil state, her lip curling in a faint sneer. “Giving up so soon?” Savannah purred, mistaking Mia’s calm for resignation. “Don’t worry. It’s better to go out with a whimper. A bang would be so unbecoming for a chef.” Mia simply met her gaze, her expression open and serene. “Good luck with your performance, Savannah,” she said, her voice even and clear, and the utter lack of animosity seemed to disarm Savannah more than any retort could have. The war was over, and Savannah hadn't even realized her opponent had already left the battlefield.

Walking onto the stage felt different this time. It was not a battlefield or a proving ground. It was simply a room. The set was stark: a single stool, a microphone stand, and Alex with his keyboard, positioned slightly behind her. The studio audience fell into a hushed silence, the anticipation palpable. They were waiting for the Alchemist to perform another grand trick, another stunning transformation. Mia took her seat, closed her eyes, and let the world fall away. The lights, the cameras, the silent thousands in the crowd—they all vanished. In her mind, she was standing at her station at Verve on a quiet Tuesday night before service. She could smell the clean, sharp scent of citrus from the prep station, feel the familiar weight of her apron, see the gleam of her polished copper pans hanging overhead. The opening notes of the dulcimer filled the space, and she began her hymn.

Her voice was clear, unadorned, and breathtakingly intimate. She wasn’t projecting to the back of the room; she was drawing the entire room into her private world. When she sang of being “frightened by the devil” and “drawn to those ones that ain’t afraid,” her voice held the memory of every brutal Saturday night service, every moment of near-failure, every ounce of respect she had for the fierce, dedicated, slightly mad chefs she had worked alongside. The performance was an act of radical vulnerability. She laid out the sacred texts of her life: the discipline, the repetition, the moments of transcendent creation, the lonely, quiet satisfaction of a job well done. There were no vocal gymnastics, no ragged, emotional screams. There was only the pure, unvarnished truth of a woman singing about the one great, constant love of her life. As she held the final, tender note, letting it fade into a whisper, she felt not a sense of triumph, but of release. She had said what she needed to say. She opened her eyes.

The silence in the studio was absolute and profound, deeper than any she had yet commanded. It was the sound of a collective held breath. Then, from the judges’ table, a single, sharp sound broke the spell. Skye had dropped her pen, and she was openly weeping, her face buried in her hands. The host, for once, seemed at a loss for words, his professional facade completely gone. He looked at Mia with an expression of raw, human astonishment. The judges were a tableau of reactions. Richard was staring at his daughter, Savannah, who sat in the contestants’ box, her face pale and rigid, her perfect composure finally shattered. For the first time, she looked like she was seeing a form of artistry she could not compute, a power she could not buy, learn, or replicate. Skye was still crying, unable to speak. All eyes, once again, turned to Marcus Thorne. He didn’t lean back in his chair this time. He was leaning forward, his elbows on the desk, his gaze fixed on Mia with an intensity that felt less like judging and more like witnessing.

“For two weeks,” Marcus began, his voice low and raspy with emotion, “we’ve called you The Alchemist, The Interpreter. We’ve praised you for what you do to other people’s songs. We were wrong.” He shook his head slowly, a look of dawning revelation on his face. “That wasn’t an interpretation. That wasn’t a performance. That was a confession. That was a piece of your soul served up on a plate. It’s the bravest thing I have ever seen on a stage. Anywhere. Ever.” He paused, and in the complete silence of the studio, his next words landed with the weight of a final verdict on the entire competition. “The show is called ‘Australia’s Aria’. An aria is a song for a single voice. It’s the moment a character stops the story and tells you who they truly are. Tonight, Amelia, you just sang your aria. And I’m not sure anyone else here has one to sing.”The silence that followed Marcus Thorne’s verdict was a living entity, a sacred, shimmering thing that no one dared break. The applause that eventually rose to meet it was not the raucous, adrenalized sound of a television audience; it was the soft, rolling thunder of a thousand private moments of recognition, a sound of reverence. Walking off the stage, Mia felt as though she were floating, detached from her own body. The usual backstage frenzy was muted, the headset-wearing crew moving around her with a new, careful deference. They did not rush her; they made space for her, as if she were a sleepwalker who could not be startled. Leo was the first to reach her, but he didn't offer a high-five or an excited whisper. He simply took her hand for a moment, his grip firm and warm, his eyes conveying a depth of understanding that went beyond words. “Thank you,” was all he said, and she knew he wasn't thanking her for a good performance, but for reminding him of something essential they had both been in danger of forgetting.

Chloe intercepted her near the dressing rooms, but her usual whirlwind energy was gone, replaced by a kind of stunned awe. The producer, the master manipulator of narratives, looked as if one of her characters had suddenly walked off the page and started writing its own story. "Amelia," she began, her voice unusually subdued. "The network president just called my cell directly. He didn't say anything. He just… cleared his throat and hung up. I think that means we're in uncharted territory." She looked at Mia not as a product to be sold, but as a strange, powerful, and slightly terrifying force of nature she had accidentally unleashed. The cynical architect of the show was gone, replaced by a bewildered witness. There was no new label for Mia this week. 'The Interpreter' was too small. 'The Alchemist' was a trick. What Mia had done was real, and Chloe had no marketing language for reality.

Julian was conspicuously absent. He wasn't in the wings, or in the production booth, or lurking in the corridors. It was as if Marcus Thorne’s speech had been a spell of erasure, rendering him so completely and utterly irrelevant that he had simply ceased to exist within the studio’s orbit. He had built his career on sanding down the soul to create a perfect surface, and Mia had just proven to a national audience that the soul was the only thing that mattered. His defeat was so total it was silent. He had not lost an argument; his entire language had been declared dead.

The most telling moment came as Mia passed the cordoned-off area where the contestants’ families were gathered. She saw Richard Thorne, Savannah's father and a judge on a rival network, standing with his arm around his daughter. But Savannah was not the furious predator Mia had last seen. The diamond-white dress seemed to hang off her, a hollow shell. Her face was a mask of placid blankness, her eyes fixed on nothing. She wasn’t angry or resentful; she looked like a brilliant mathematician who had just been presented with a problem that could not be solved with numbers, an equation that required a variable she did not possess and could never acquire. She had built her life on the principle that talent, ambition, and relentless work were an invincible combination. In a single, quiet song, Mia had shown her they were not enough. Her war of attrition was over because she had been fighting for territory that turned out to be worthless.

The elimination ceremony was a strange, subdued affair. The host had lost his slick, gameshow veneer, his voice softer, his questions to the judges more thoughtful. When he announced that Mia was, of course, safe, a wave of gentle, knowing applause went through the room. There was no suspense. It was a foregone conclusion. The tension shifted to who would be leaving, and when a young, talented boy named Ethan was voted off, it felt less like a dramatic expulsion and more like a quiet, sorrowful necessity. The competition itself suddenly seemed small and a little cruel, a trivial game played in the shadow of the monumental thing that had just occurred.

Back in her hotel room, the silence was a welcome blanket. The congratulatory fruit basket and bottle of champagne from the network sat on the desk, looking like absurdly inappropriate props. She ignored them and picked up the phone to call Alfie. He answered with a soft, “I know, my dear. I know.” There was no shouting, no triumphant bellowing. His voice was thick with emotion, a quiet, profound pride that resonated more deeply than any ovation. "I always knew that song was in you," he said. "It just needed the right room to be heard. Not a kitchen, not a conservatory. Just a quiet room inside yourself." She spoke with him for a long time, their conversation meandering through shared memories of her grandfather, of old records, of the simple, unadorned beauty of a thing made with love. It was a conversation that stitched the two halves of her life back together, closing the canyon that had been opening between Sydney and Brisbane.

After the call, she walked to the vast window and looked down at the glittering, indifferent city. She reached into her bag and took out her grandfather's paring knife, its worn wooden handle a warm, familiar presence in her palm. For weeks, it had been her secret weapon, her hidden armour, a talisman against the artificial world she had been fighting. But tonight, as she held it, its meaning had changed. It was no longer a weapon. It was a compass. It was pointing her way home. The competition, the recording contract, the fame—they were all just glittering lights on a distant shore. She had come here chasing a ghost of a dream and, in the process, had found the most solid, tangible thing in the world: herself. The high note she had been searching for wasn't on a stage; it was in the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly executed dish, in the rhythm of a kitchen she had built, in the weary camaraderie of her team. The prize was not something they could give her. It was something she already had. She had won, and her victory had absolutely nothing to do with winning the show. The rest of the competition was just a formality, an epilogue to a story whose climax had already passed. All that was left was to decide when to walk out of the theatre and go home.The days that followed were lived in a strange, rarefied atmosphere, as if a bell jar had descended over Mia, separating her from the normal flow of life. The other contestants, who had once viewed her with a mixture of suspicion and resentment, now treated her with a skittish reverence. They would fall silent when she entered a room, their conversations about vocal runs and social media engagement suddenly sounding trivial and foolish in her presence. They offered her the best seat at the breakfast table, passed her the salt before she asked for it, and spoke to her in hushed, careful tones. Leo was the only one who still looked her in the eye, but even their fire-escape conversations had changed. The easy camaraderie had been replaced by a more thoughtful, philosophical tone, two soldiers discussing the nature of a war that one of them had already, inexplicably, won. The isolation was more profound than any hostility she had faced. She was no longer a competitor; she was a monument, and it was a lonely thing to be.

The power shift was made official at the next production meeting. The theme was the semi-final, the penultimate week, and Chloe began the meeting with her usual brisk efficiency. But when she got to Mia, her entire demeanor changed. There was no pre-selected song, no clever trap, no narrative brief. She simply folded her hands on the table, leaned forward, and asked a question Mia had never expected to hear. “Mia,” she said, her voice stripped of its usual artifice. “What do you want to sing?” The question hung in the air, a vast, terrifying expanse of open road. For weeks, Mia had navigated by pushing against the barriers they had erected. The fight had become her compass. Now, with all the barriers removed, she was adrift in a sea of infinite choice, and she had never felt more lost. Every other contestant in the room stiffened, their gazes flicking between Chloe and Mia, recognizing the unprecedented transfer of power. Julian, who had been forced to attend the meeting, stared at the surface of the table, his knuckles white, a general forced to witness his unconditional surrender.

Mia didn’t have an answer. The freedom was a heavier burden than any constraint had been. She spent the next day in a fog, wandering the sterile corridors of the hotel, unable to settle. She tried to think of a song, but her mind was a blank. What was there left to say? She had sung her confession, her aria. Anything else felt like a postscript, an unnecessary footnote. She found herself on the fire escape, staring down at the alley, when Leo joined her. “They gave you the keys to the kingdom, huh?” he said quietly, leaning against the railing. “So what does the queen decree?” Mia sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I think the queen has abdicated, Leo. I don’t know what to do. The fight is gone. I don’t know how to move without something to push against.” He nodded, understanding. “Maybe it’s not about pushing anymore,” he offered. “You’re not fighting your way out of a box now. You’re standing on a mountaintop. You just have to decide what you want the world to see from up there.”

The view she needed came, as it always did, from Brisbane. That night, she called Ben. He answered with an uncharacteristic, breathless urgency. “You’re not going to believe this,” he said, the clatter of the kitchen sounding distant, as if he’d retreated to the storeroom for privacy. “You know that food critic, Antoine Dubois? The one from the Sydney broadsheet, the one they call ‘The Kingmaker’? He was in Brisbane for that food festival. He came in. Tuesday night. Unannounced.” Mia’s heart stopped. Dubois was a legend, a terrifyingly influential critic whose opinion could build or break a restaurant overnight. “He came in?” she whispered. “What happened?” Ben took a deep breath. “The review came out online an hour ago, Mia. He’s calling Verve ‘a pilgrimage site for anyone who still believes in the profound, unpretentious power of flavour.’ He wrote a whole paragraph about the split pea velouté. A whole goddamn paragraph. He said… he said it was clear the Head Chef wasn’t in the building, but that her soul was in every single pan.” There was a crackle on the line, and for a moment, Mia thought she heard Ben choke up. “We did it, boss,” he said, his voice thick with a pride so fierce and raw it was almost painful to hear. “You weren’t even here, and we did it.”

Mia hung up the phone, her body trembling with a complex cocktail of emotions. There was overwhelming pride in Ben and her team, a wave of gratitude so immense it brought tears to her eyes. But beneath it was a sharp, piercing ache of longing. A deep, hollow sadness that she had missed it. She had been in Sydney, playing a pop star in a sequined dress, while her team, her family, had achieved one of their biggest triumphs without her. Her soul was in every pan. The critic’s words were a signpost, a lighthouse beam cutting through the fog of her confusion. Her legacy wasn’t a recording contract. It was a thriving kitchen. It was a sous-chef who had become a leader. It was a perfect split pea velouté served on a busy Tuesday night. That was her real music. In that moment, she knew what she had to do. The mountaintop Leo had spoken of wasn’t for her to plant her own flag. It was to give a benediction.

She found Chloe the next morning in her glass-walled office, a hive of frantic activity. Mia walked in and stood before the desk, waiting until the producer looked up. “I have my song,” Mia said simply. Chloe’s eyes lit up. “Wonderful! What is it? Something epic? An anthem?” Mia took a breath. “I want to sing ‘The Parting Glass’,” she said. Chloe frowned, confused. “‘The Parting Glass’? The old Irish folk song?” It was a song of farewell, a toast to good company, a quiet and humble goodbye. In the context of a dramatic, high-stakes television semi-final, it was commercial suicide. It was the antithesis of a show-stopping performance. “But… why?” Chloe stammered, the marketing gears in her brain grinding to a halt. “It’s not… competitive. It’s a closing number, not a fighting one.” “Exactly,” Mia said, her voice filled with a calm, unshakeable certainty. “I’m not fighting anymore. My final performances on this show are not for me. They’re a thank you. One is for the people who got me here. And the other,” she said, thinking of the grand final to come, “is for the people I’m going home to.” Chloe stared at her, utterly baffled, searching for an angle, a narrative she could sell, and finding none. Mia had moved so far beyond the confines of the show that she was now using its multi-million-dollar platform to offer a simple, heartfelt toast, as if she were at the end of a long dinner with friends. It was the most radical, most defiant act she could have possibly chosen.The silence in Chloe’s glass-walled office was deafening. The producer, a woman whose entire career was built on predicting and manipulating audience response, stared at Mia as if she had just started speaking in tongues. "The Parting Glass?" Chloe repeated, her voice a thin thread of disbelief. "Mia, it's the semi-final. The voting is worth millions in advertising revenue. People are expecting a battle. You and Savannah, you and Leo. It’s a drama we’ve spent weeks building. You can't just... end it with a folk song. It's an anti-climax. It’s giving up." Mia offered a small, patient smile. "It's not giving up, Chloe. It's letting go. There's a difference." From the corner of her eye, she saw Julian, who had been observing the exchange with a kind of morbid curiosity, stand up. He walked slowly towards them, a final, weary ghost at the feast. "Don't you see, Chloe?" he said, his voice devoid of its usual venom, replaced by a hollow, academic bitterness. "This is the most arrogant move of all. To be so certain of her own genius that she no longer needs to compete. She has decided the game is beneath her, so she is taking her ball and going home, but she's making us all watch her do it." It was meant as an insult, a final, parting shot, but to Mia, it sounded like the most accurate assessment she had yet heard. She was taking her ball and going home.

The week that followed was the quietest of her time in Sydney. The production machine, having finally encountered an obstacle it could neither defeat nor co-opt, simply routed around her. While Savannah rehearsed a technically staggering, emotionally vacant rendition of a Whitney Houston power ballad, a song designed to be a showcase of pure vocal athletics, and Leo polished a raw, beautifully crafted original song about his hometown, Mia’s rehearsals were sparse and meditative. She would sit with Alex in the empty studio, often not singing at all, just talking through the verses of the old song, discussing its simple, profound sentiment. It was a song about gratitude for friends, sorrow at leaving, and hope for a safe return. There were no complex dynamics to master, no 'money notes' to perfect. The only technical challenge was sincerity. The quietness gave her time to think, to decompress, to fully absorb the news from Verve. The restaurant’s triumph was a tether, pulling her back to earth, reminding her that the glittering, high-stakes world of the show was a temporary weather pattern, while her kitchen was the landscape of her life.

On the night of the semi-final, the backstage atmosphere was electric with tension, but it swirled around Mia without touching her. She was the calm at the center of the hurricane. Savannah, radiant and terrifying in a gown of molten gold, shot her a look of pure, competitive fury, seeing Mia’s quietude as an unforgivable slight to the gravity of the occasion. Leo, his face etched with the nervous energy of performing his own work, gave her a thumbs-up that was both encouraging and questioning. “You sure about this, Russo?” he murmured as they passed in the corridor. “Absolutely,” she replied, and the certainty in her own voice was a comfort. Her performance was scheduled last, a position usually reserved for the night’s most anticipated act. It was Chloe's final, desperate attempt to frame Mia’s quiet farewell as a dramatic climax. Dressed in the same simple, deep blue dress from the week before, Mia waited in the wings, not with nerves, but with a sense of solemn purpose. She was not here to win. She was here to say thank you and goodbye.

When she walked out onto the stage, the audience greeted her with a roar of expectation. The set was completely dark, save for a single, warm spotlight, the colour of candlelight, in the center of the stage. There was no piano, no stool, no microphone stand. She walked into the light and simply stood, her hands clasped loosely in front of her. She waited for the applause to die down, waited until a complete and perfect silence had fallen over the cavernous room. Then, without introduction, she began to sing, her voice a cappella, clear and unadorned, as if she were offering a toast in a quiet room at the end of a long night. She sang the first verse looking out into the darkness, a dedication to the faceless crowd, the strangers who had listened and voted and granted her this strange, improbable journey. *“Of all the money that e'er I had, I spent it in good company.”* For the second verse, her gaze shifted, as if looking through the walls of the studio, across the country to a small, cluttered house in Paddington and a noisy, steaming kitchen in New Farm. *“And all the harm that e'er I've done, alas it was to none but me.”* It was an apology and a promise to Alfie, to Ben, to the life she had temporarily left behind. Her voice was not sad, but warm and full of a deep, abiding love. For the final verse, she looked directly into the main camera, a direct address to the millions watching. *“But since it falls unto my lot, that I should rise and you should not, I gently rise and softly call, good night and joy be with you all.”* She held the final, simple note, letting it hang in the air for a moment before letting it go, and then she gave a small, almost imperceptible bow, and walked out of the light.

The silence she left behind was absolute, a sacred void. No one knew how to react. Applause felt crass. The host walked out, his face a mixture of confusion and profound emotion. The judges were speechless. Skye was crying again, silently this time. Richard Thorne was shaking his head, looking at his daughter Savannah, whose face was a mask of furious incomprehension. Finally, Marcus Thorne cleared his throat. The sound echoed in the silent studio. “A performance is usually a plea for approval,” he said, his voice heavy. “It’s an artist saying, ‘Please, love me. Please, choose me.’ What we have just witnessed was the opposite. That was an artist saying, ‘I have loved this. I have valued you. But I do not need your approval to know who I am.’ That was not a performance. That was a resignation.” He looked directly at Mia, who was now standing with the host. “In a competition full of people trying to start a career, you just beautifully, and gracefully, ended your run. It’s the most honorable exit I’ve ever seen.” The vote that night felt like a bizarre formality. The public, moved and confused and respecting her silent request, did not carry her through. She did not make the final two. The grand final would be between Leo and Savannah. As her name was announced as the one leaving, Mia felt a wave of relief so pure and profound it was almost dizzying. She hugged a stunned Leo, shook a triumphant but still confused Savannah’s hand, and smiled at the camera, a genuine, unburdened smile. She had not lost. She had simply chosen to stop playing. She had given her notice, and now, finally, she was free to go home.The pandemonium that followed her on-stage elimination was a strange, inverted version of all the nights that had come before. There were no urgent producers pulling her towards post-show interviews, no makeup artists rushing in for touch-ups for the cameras. Instead, the machinery of the show simply moved on without her, its focus instantly shifting to the two victors, Leo and Savannah. Mia was suddenly, blessedly invisible, an obstacle that had been gracefully removed. As she was gently guided backstage, she saw Leo being mobbed by cameras, a dazed, deer-in-the-headlights look on his face as the reality of being a Grand Finalist descended upon him. He caught her eye over the shoulder of an interviewer and gave a small, grateful, and slightly terrified smile. He was free to fight for the prize, because she had shown him what it truly meant to win.

Her final exit was a quiet affair. A junior production assistant, a young woman who had always looked at Mia with a kind of nervous sympathy, handed her a small cardboard box containing the few personal items from her dressing room. Chloe appeared for a final, pragmatic farewell. She wasn't angry; she looked like a chess player tipping her king over in grudging respect for a brilliant, unorthodox checkmate. “You gave us a hell of a story, Russo,” she said, shaking Mia’s hand firmly. “Best damn narrative arc of the season. When you decide to write that cookbook, and you will, my office is your first call. We’ll brand it ‘The Soul of Flavour’. It’ll sell a million copies.” It was the highest compliment Chloe knew how to give: a fully formed marketing strategy.

The journey back to the hotel was not in one of the show’s sleek black cars, but in a functional, anonymous taxi. As she shed the physical space of the studio, she felt the persona of ‘The Alchemist’ begin to slough off as well, a heavy costume she was finally allowed to remove. Back in the hotel room that had been her luxurious prison, she packed with a swift and unsentimental efficiency. She left the untouched fruit basket, the congratulatory champagne, and the memory of a hundred anxious nights. Into her worn bag went her small collection of clothes, Alfie’s Joan Baez tape, and her knife roll. She unzipped the hidden pocket in the velvet dress she had worn, but instead of her grandfather’s knife, she left a single, perfect bay leaf she had found in her pocket from her chef’s jacket weeks ago. A final, quiet offering to the gods of a different church. She checked out of the hotel in the dead of night, a ghost slipping away before the city awoke, leaving no trace of her existence except for a television narrative that already felt like it belonged to someone else.

The anonymity of the early morning flight was a balm. Without the studio lights and the television makeup, she was just another tired traveller in jeans and a jumper. The woman next to her complained about the price of airport coffee, and the man across the aisle snored softly, and the sheer, blissful normality of it all almost made Mia weep with relief. As the plane climbed through the clouds, leaving the glittering sprawl of Sydney behind, she felt the last vestiges of the pressure, the competition, and the intense public scrutiny dissolve into the thin, high-altitude air. She hadn’t just been eliminated; she had been exorcised. She was no longer a story, a brand, or a phenomenon. She was just Amelia Russo, a chef on her way home.

The blast of warm, wet Brisbane air that greeted her at the airport was the first real thing she had felt in months. It was thick with the familiar scents of damp earth and tropical blossoms, a perfume of belonging that instantly relaxed a tension in her shoulders she hadn’t even realized she was carrying. She bypassed the taxi rank and took the train, watching the familiar landscape of tin-roofed houses, sprawling poinciana trees, and the slow, brown curve of the river slide past. Her first stop wasn’t her apartment. It was the rickety wooden galleon in Paddington. The gate groaned its familiar protest, the wind chimes tinkled their discordant welcome, and the front door, as always, was unlocked. She found Alfie in the conservatory, not listening to a record, but quietly polishing a set of old silver teaspoons, a task of patient, gentle restoration. He looked up as she entered, and his face broke into a huge, radiant smile that held no trace of disappointment, only a deep and unwavering pride. “Ah,” he said, as if she had just stepped out for a moment to buy milk. “The traveller returns.” He didn’t hug her. Instead, he handed her a polishing cloth and another spoon. “I thought you might need something quiet to do with your hands,” he said. They sat in comfortable silence for a long time, the only sounds the soft rasp of cloth on silver and the distant chatter of kookaburras, and in that quiet, shared task, Mia felt the last of the Sydney static drain out of her, replaced by the steady, grounding rhythm of home.

It was mid-afternoon when she finally left Alfie’s, her soul polished as bright as the spoons. She didn’t walk towards her own quiet apartment, but towards the controlled chaos of her other home. She walked down the familiar alleyway behind Verve, the air already beginning to thicken with the delicious preliminary scents of evening service. She could hear the muffled clang of pans and the deep thrum of the extraction fans, a symphony she knew better than any pop song. She pushed open the back door, the one that always stuck slightly, and stepped inside. The kitchen was in the full, focused swing of pre-service prep. A young apprentice was meticulously dicing onions, his brow furrowed in concentration. The pastry chef was piping delicate rosettes onto a dessert. And at the pass, consulting a docket and calling out an order, was Ben. He had a smudge of flour on his cheek and a look of absolute, unwavering command on his face. He wasn’t her sous-chef anymore. He was a chef. He looked up, his eyes scanning the kitchen, and then he saw her, standing by the door in her civilian clothes, a ghost from another world. He stopped mid-sentence. For a second, the entire kitchen seemed to hold its breath. Then, a slow, tired, infinitely welcoming grin spread across his face. He didn’t say hello or welcome back. He simply jerked his head towards the staff lockers. “You’re late, Russo,” he said, his voice laced with his familiar, cynical affection. “There’s a prep list a mile long.”

Mia’s answering smile was the first completely unguarded, purely joyful one she’d had in months. She walked to her locker, the members of her team offering quiet nods and relieved smiles, a silent, heartfelt welcome. She pulled on her worn chef’s whites, the familiar weight of the fabric a comfort. She tied her apron, the strings settling into their usual place around her waist. She walked to her station, which was immaculately clean, just as she had left it. She unrolled her knives, the worn leather making a soft, familiar sound against the stainless steel. Her hands, which had spent weeks holding nothing more substantial than a microphone, closed around the familiar, worn handle of her favourite chef’s knife. It felt like an extension of her own arm. Ben slid a hotel pan of shallots towards her. “Velouté for the tasting menu,” he said quietly. “Dubois is gone, but the food critics are circling like sharks now. No pressure.” She didn’t answer. She took her nine-inch copper pan, her pan, and placed it over the flame. A splash of oil, a knob of butter. She waited, watching the butter foam and clarify, her entire world narrowing once more to this perfect circle of heat and potential. She sliced the shallots, her movements an economy of grace born of a thousand services. Then she tipped them into the shimmering fat. The hiss of the shallots hitting the hot pan was a sharp, promising sizzle. It was the opening note, her opening note. It was a sound more familiar, more true, more beautiful than any applause. It was the sound of her own heartbeat. She was home.The first service back at Verve was a symphony played at double speed, a frantic, exhilarating ballet of heat and steel. The dockets flew from the printer in an endless, chattering stream, each one a testament to the restaurant’s newfound fame. Every table was full, and a second seating was already booked solid. The quiet, neighbourhood gem she had nurtured was gone, replaced by a destination, a culinary hotspot buzzing with a new, more demanding clientele. They were not just here for the food; they were here for the story. They were here for her. Mia moved through the chaos with a preternatural calm she hadn't possessed before, a stillness learned in the eye of the television storm. The pressure of a fully booked service, which had once felt like a tightening band around her chest, now seemed manageable, almost gentle, compared to the searing scrutiny of a live national broadcast. She was no longer just the high priestess of this temple; she was a returning war hero, and the familiar battleground of her kitchen felt like a welcome refuge.

The change was most palpable in the whispers from the front of house. "Table seven says they saw you sing Joni Mitchell and it changed their life," a young waiter reported, his eyes wide with awe as he relayed the message. A few minutes later, another came back, looking flustered. "Table twelve is asking if you'll come out. They want a photo for their Instagram." Ben, searing kingfish beside her, let out a low growl. "Tell them the chef is currently communing with the spirit of a scallop and cannot be disturbed," he muttered without looking up. Mia, however, simply wiped her hands on her apron and gave the waiter a calm, practiced smile. "Please tell table twelve that I'm so glad they're enjoying their meal, and that my focus has to be in the kitchen tonight to make sure it's perfect for them." It was a polite, firm refusal, a boundary she was drawing not with anger, but with an unshakable sense of professional purpose. She was not an exhibit. The food was the show, and she was merely its conductor, back in the pit where she belonged.

As the last docket was cleared and the weary, familiar ritual of cleanup began, the shift in the kitchen's internal dynamic became clear. The young apprentices, who once would have joked with her over the scrub-down sinks, were now quiet and deferential, addressing her only as 'Chef' and avoiding her gaze. She was no longer just their boss; she was a celebrity, a figure from the television, and a new, uncomfortable distance had settled between them. She tried to bridge it, asking Jamie, the accident-prone apprentice, about his knife skills, but he just flushed red and mumbled a response, his usual boisterous energy gone. She felt a pang of loss for the easy, unselfconscious camaraderie they had once shared. It was an unexpected cost of her brief, glittering detour. The fame she had never wanted had followed her home, turning her from a leader into an icon, and she wasn't sure she liked the transformation.

After the last of the junior staff had wiped down their stations and departed into the Brisbane night, only she and Ben remained, a familiar silence settling over the gleaming, sterile kitchen. It was a silence filled with unspoken words, with a whole chapter of their shared history that had been lived apart. Ben cracked two beers, the sharp hiss of the caps echoing in the quiet room, and handed one to her. They leaned against the cool stainless-steel counter, just as they had a thousand times before. “You were good tonight,” he said, his gaze fixed on the middle distance. “Calm. Didn’t know you had that in you.” Mia took a long drink of the cold beer, the bitter hops a welcome shock. “Turns out a million people judging you is good practice for a full reservations book,” she said with a wry smile. She paused, then turned to him, her expression serious. “The review, Ben. Dubois. I read it. It wasn't about me. It was about you. About all of you. What you did here while I was gone… it was everything we ever talked about wanting this place to be.”

Ben shrugged, trying to hide behind his usual shield of cynicism, but his eyes betrayed him. There was a glimmer of pride, of profound, hard-won satisfaction. “We just cooked the food, boss. Kept the fire lit.” Mia shook her head, a slow, deliberate motion. “No. You did more than that. You made it better. You ran the pass, you managed the team, you got a review that chefs work their entire lives for. This isn’t just my kitchen anymore, Ben. It can’t be. It wouldn’t be fair.” She took another breath, the words feeling more right than any lyric she had ever sung. “I spoke to the accountants this afternoon. I want to make you a partner. Not just Executive Chef, but a partner. Verve by Russo and… well, you can choose your own damn name.” Ben froze, his beer halfway to his lips. He stared at her, his cynical mask completely gone, leaving his face open and vulnerable. He looked from her eyes to the familiar surfaces of the kitchen, as if seeing it all for the first time. He swallowed hard, a muscle working in his jaw. “Are you serious?” he asked, his voice rough with an emotion he rarely showed. Mia just nodded, a slow, steady affirmation. He was silent for a long moment, then he let out a shaky breath and a single, incredulous laugh. “A partner,” he said, the words tasting strange and new. He looked at her, and the distance that had grown between them vanished, replaced by a deep, solid bond of mutual respect. “Alright, Chef,” he said, raising his bottle in a toast. “But if you think that means I’m doing the ordering from the carrot guy, you’ve got another thing coming.”

A week later, Mia found herself sitting on the worn wicker armchair in Alfie’s conservatory. The final episode of ‘Australia’s Aria’ was playing on a small, ancient television Alfie had unearthed from a pile of junk, its colours slightly washed out, its sound tinny. The spectacle on screen seemed like a dispatch from another planet. The pyrotechnics, the screaming crowds, the impossibly white teeth of the host—it was a gaudy, chaotic circus that bore no resemblance to the quiet, creative core of music she held in her heart. She watched Savannah deliver a flawless, powerful, and utterly soulless performance that earned her rapturous applause. Then she watched Leo, alone with his guitar, sing his original song. It was quiet, imperfect, and achingly beautiful, a raw nerve of a song that silenced the room. He didn’t look like a pop star; he looked like a man confessing a secret to a few thousand of his closest friends. Alfie, beside her, sipped his sherry and nodded in quiet approval.

When the host announced Leo as the winner, a genuine, unforced smile spread across Mia’s face. She felt a surge of pure, uncomplicated happiness for him, the dinosaur who had survived the meteor strike. She pulled out her phone and sent him a simple text: *“They finally listened. Congratulations, Leo. You earned it. - M.”* She put the phone away, having no expectation of a reply. As the credits rolled and Leo was mobbed on stage, his face a picture of stunned disbelief, Alfie switched off the television, plunging the room back into the quiet, analogue world of ticking clocks and rustling leaves. The show was over. The story was finished. And it had nothing to do with her.

The next afternoon found her in the kitchen during the quiet lull before service. The new pressures were still there—the reservation book was full until Christmas, and there was a waiting list for cancellations—but within the four walls of her kitchen, she had found her equilibrium. She was not working on the line, but at a small prep table in the corner, a space she had cleared for creative work. In front of her was a beautiful, deep-red cut of kangaroo loin and a collection of native Australian ingredients: sunrise limes, pepperberries, lemon myrtle. She was working on a new dish, a dish that tasted of home. She was searing the kangaroo, the scent rich and gamy, then creating a sauce that balanced the sweetness of plums with the sharp, floral bite of the pepperberries. It was a dish of contrasts: wild and refined, ancient and modern. It was a dish that told a story. Ben came over, wiping his hands on a cloth, and watched her work. He picked up a spoon, dipped it into the sauce, and tasted. He closed his eyes for a moment, processing the complex layers of flavour. “It needs a bit more acid to cut the richness,” he said, his voice thoughtful, already a collaborator. “Maybe from the sunrise limes?” Mia nodded, passing him the small, pearl-like citrus. “And something earthy,” she mused. “A smoked salt?” Their conversation was a quiet, creative dance, a seamless exchange of ideas. Her journey had not been a detour. It had been a foraging expedition, and she had come back with new flavours, a new perspective, and a partner to help her create the next menu. The symphony was beginning a new movement, richer and more complex than anything she could have composed alone.The new iteration of Verve was louder. It wasn’t just the increased volume of chatter from the dining room, a constant, energetic hum that permeated the kitchen walls. It was a different quality of sound. It was the sound of expectation, the brittle laughter of people who had come not just to eat but to be seen, the intrusive flash and click of smartphone cameras capturing artfully arranged plates for their social media feeds. The quiet neighbourhood reverence had been replaced by the noisy clamour of destination dining. Mia felt the change most acutely in the dockets. Alongside orders for the tasting menu were scribbled notes from the waitstaff: “Table 4 wants to know if the scallops are the same ones from the show,” or “Table 9, big fan, wants to meet the ‘Alchemist’.” Each ticket was a reminder that she was no longer just a chef; she was a character, and her food was a souvenir of a story they had consumed on television.

Ben took on the role of guarding the kitchen’s sanctity with the ferocity of a cerberus. He became the buffer between the chaos of the front-of-house and the focused sanctuary of the pass. He intercepted fawning waiters, batted away ridiculous requests, and ruled the dining room with a kind of benevolent tyranny that protected Mia’s creative space. Their partnership settled into a natural, unspoken rhythm. He handled the external pressures, the logistics, the management of the restaurant’s burgeoning reputation, freeing her to handle the internal, creative soul of the menu. They were two halves of a single, functioning brain. One night, after turning away a particularly insistent food blogger who had demanded a ‘private cooking lesson’ for his followers, Ben leaned against the counter during a rare lull, wiping sweat from his brow. "It's like they think this is a theme park," he grumbled, gesturing towards the dining room. "Verveland. Home of the Singing Chef. Come for the velouté, stay for the backstory." Mia looked at the focused faces of her team, at the quiet intensity of their work, a world away from the performative diners on the other side of the wall. "They can call it whatever they want," she said, her voice calm. "As long as when they take their first bite, they forget all about the story and just taste the food. That's the only battle that matters now."

It was a few weeks after the finale, late on a Tuesday night after a surprisingly gruelling service, that her phone buzzed with an unknown Sydney number. Her first instinct was a flash of visceral annoyance, a conditioned response to the world she had left behind. She almost ignored it, but some impulse made her answer. "Hello?" The voice on the other end was hesitant, and so quiet she could barely hear it over the sound of her own dishwasher. “Mia? It’s Leo.” The sound of his voice was a dispatch from another lifetime. He sounded tired, the easy warmth she remembered worn thin, stretched taut. "Hey, Leo," she said, a genuine smile touching her lips as she leaned against her apartment wall. "Congratulations again. I saw it. You were amazing. How’s life as the king?" There was a long pause, filled with the faint sound of city traffic on his end. "It's… a lot," he finally said, and the profound weariness in those two words told her everything. “They have me in writing sessions ten hours a day. It’s not really writing. It’s more like… marketing. A team of Swedish guys who write hits for teenagers keep trying to add a ‘whoa-oh’ chorus to a song I wrote about my grandmother.”

Mia closed her eyes, a familiar, cold feeling twisting in her gut. She could picture it perfectly: the sterile, sound-proofed room, the too-perky producers, the feeling of a piece of your soul being treated like a flawed piece of code that needed debugging. "They’re trying to find your hashtag," she said softly. "Yeah," he sighed, a sound of deep frustration. "They told me my stuff is 'too specific,' that it doesn’t have 'four-quadrant appeal'. They want to pair me with a DJ to do a remix of my original song. They think it could be a summer dance anthem." The absurdity of it was tragic. They were taking his quiet, heartbreaking ballad and trying to turn it into something to be played in a noisy club. They were taking his soul and setting it to a 120 beats-per-minute tempo. "I keep thinking about what you did," he continued, his voice dropping lower. "How you just… walked away. I can't do that, Mia. I signed the contract. This was my dream. But it’s starting to feel like a nightmare, and I’m so tired of fighting."

Mia thought of the advice she could give. She could tell him to fight them, to leak the demos, to be the rebel. She could tell him to just give in, take the money, and play the game. But neither felt right, neither felt true. She thought of Ben, and the kitchen, and the perfect balance they had found. "You can't walk away, Leo," she said, her voice clear and certain. "And you can't fight them head-on. They feed on that drama. You have to be smarter. You have to be a chef." He was silent, listening. "They're the customer," she explained. "A really dumb customer who wants their steak well-done. You can't refuse to cook it, that's your job now. But you don't have to give them your best cut of meat. You give them the piece that can handle the heat. You cook their steak, you smile, and you say ‘great choice’. But you save your soul, your best ingredients, for a secret dish that you cook only for yourself. You write your real songs at three in the morning, when no one is listening. You play them in tiny, dive bars on your night off for ten people who actually care. You build a secret kitchen, a place they can’t touch." She paused, letting the metaphor settle. "They've bought your services, Leo. They haven't bought your soul. Don't ever let them convince you those two things are the same." There was a long silence on the line, and then she heard him take a slow, deep breath, the first real breath she had heard from him. “A secret kitchen," he repeated, the words full of a newfound hope. "Okay. I can do that. Thank you, Mia. Really."

Months later, on a perfect Brisbane autumn evening, Mia stood on Alfie’s verandah, the setting sun painting the clouds a bruised, glorious orange. The air was thick with the scent of frangipani and the approaching dusk. In her hands, she held a small, rustic bowl. Inside was a scoop of lemon myrtle sorbet she had made that afternoon, its flavour clean, sharp, and intensely local. It was part of a new dessert for the Verve menu, a dish that tasted purely of this place, of this moment. Alfie stood beside her, looking out at his chaotic garden. He held a similar bowl, eating the sorbet with one of his polished silver teaspoons. Down below, the city’s lights began to flicker on, a man-made constellation that seemed a million miles away. From inside the house, the warm, mournful sound of a cello—Jacqueline du Pré—drifted out from the record player. It was the same music that had been playing the night her life had tilted on its axis, the night the call had come. But tonight, it wasn't a soundtrack for anxiety; it was a hymn of peace. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, but she didn’t look at it. It was probably a notification about a new glowing review, or an email from a publisher about the cookbook Chloe had predicted, or perhaps even a message from Leo, telling her about a secret song he had played in a quiet bar. It didn't matter. The noise of that other world was just background static now. She took a spoonful of the sorbet. The taste was bright, and cold, and utterly real. It was the taste of her own story, told in a language she had never forgotten. It was a high, clear note, held perfectly, in the quiet symphony of a life she had chosen, a life she had made.
