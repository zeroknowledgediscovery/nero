The garden was a joke without a punchline. Chénelle stood on the terracotta tiles of her patio, lukewarm coffee in a mug that said ‘World’s Okayest Comedian’, and surveyed the green anarchy that was supposed to be her backyard. It wasn’t a yard, not really. It was a botanical riot. Bougainvillea, the colour of a furious sunset, had throttled a trellis and was now making a break for the roof. Weeds, thick as a wrestler’s wrist, poked through the flagstones with a kind of insolent pride. She had bought this house on the arid plains outside Madrid as a statement, a declaration that she, Chénelle, child of a cramped flat in Lavapiés and veteran of a thousand sticky-floored comedy clubs, had *arrived*. She had arrived, apparently, in the middle of a horticultural uprising.

She took a sip of coffee. It was bitter. Just like her new material. The problem with success was that it sanded down the interesting edges. Her best jokes had always come from desperation, from the grit of being broke and the absurdity of dating men who thought feminism was a brand of French cheese. Now she had money. She had a mortgage. She had a garden that was actively trying to eat her house. The desperation was gone, replaced by a vague, well-fed ennui. And it was not funny. Her agent, a man named Ricardo who communicated primarily through sighs, had been clear. ‘The people, they want the old Chénelle. The hungry Chénelle.’

‘I am hungry, Ricardo,’ she’d told him over the phone last week, staring into her cavernous, empty fridge. ‘I’m just too tired to go to the Mercadona.’

A noise from the gate broke her reverie. A metallic clatter, the sound of a latch being wrestled with. The agency. They’d promised to send someone for weeks. ‘A man who understands the earth,’ the woman on the phone had cooed, as if she were dispatching a shaman and not a day labourer. Chénelle expected a gnarled old man with a face like a walnut and a permanent scent of compost.

The man who stepped through the gate was not a walnut. He was tall and lean, built from the kind of quiet muscle that comes from lifting heavy things slowly and for a very long time. He wore a faded grey t-shirt that clung to the sweat on his back, and his dark hair was a mess of curls the sun had tipped with bronze. He moved with a strange economy, his eyes scanning the chaos of her garden not with dismay, but with a kind of calm, diagnostic intelligence. He wasn't assessing a problem; he was reading a story. Chénelle felt a sudden, sharp jolt, an unwelcome fizz of electricity that had nothing to do with her material and everything to do with the way the light caught the line of his jaw. She stayed perfectly still, hiding behind a pillar, a voyeur in her own home. This, she thought, this is a bit. Woman, trapped in ivory tower, spies on peasant with phenomenal trapezius muscles. It was hacky. It was beneath her. And yet, she couldn't look away.

He set a canvas bag on the ground, and from it, he began to pull tools. They were old tools, the wooden handles worn smooth and dark with use, the metal blades sharpened to a gleam. He handled them with a familiarity that was almost tender. He selected a pair of long-handled shears and approached the bougainvillea, the primary aggressor. He didn't attack it. He circled it, studying the tangle of branches, the way it climbed, the points where it was strongest. He was like a detective interviewing a suspect. Chénelle found herself holding her breath. She, who could stand in front of two thousand people and dissect the failures of the Spanish political system with a smirk, was hiding from the gardener. The absurdity was not lost on her. It was, in fact, the first thing she’d found genuinely funny all week.

Taking a deep breath, she stepped out from behind the pillar. ‘Hola,’ she called out, her voice a little too loud in the morning stillness.

He turned. His eyes were the colour of dark honey, and they held her gaze for a beat longer than was strictly necessary. He didn't smile, just gave a slight, formal nod. ‘Señora.’

‘Chénelle,’ she corrected him automatically. ‘Just Chénelle. The Señora is my mother, and she thinks a garden is something you buy vegetables from.’ The joke landed and died in the dry air between them. He just watched her, his expression unreadable. God, he was a tough crowd.

‘The agency sent me. For the…,’ he gestured vaguely at the green monster devouring her wall. His voice was a low baritone, a gravelly hum that seemed to vibrate in the air.

‘The jungle, yes. My own personal Amazon. I think I saw a monkey in there yesterday, but it might have been a very large rat. I’m trying to domesticate it. For the act.’ Silence. Nothing. Not even a twitch. This guy was a black hole of comedy.

‘I am Mateo,’ he said finally, as if the information had been extracted under duress.

‘Mateo,’ she repeated. The name felt solid in her mouth. Earthy. ‘Well, Mateo. Welcome to the disaster. My only instruction is to make it look less like it’s plotting my murder. Other than that, go wild. Or, you know, the opposite of wild.’

He gave that same tiny, infuriating nod and turned back to the bougainvillea. The conversation, it seemed, was over. Chénelle retreated to the patio, feeling oddly dismissed. She was used to holding a room, to being the centre of gravity. Mateo’s gravity was his own, a quiet, dense star she simply orbited. She sat down at her glass table, opened her laptop, and stared at a blank page titled ‘NEW SHOW - DRAFT 1’. She typed: *So I hired a gardener. He’s so handsome he makes you want to photosynthesise.* She deleted it. Too cheesy. She typed: *Men who work with their hands are a different species. My ex used his hands to scroll through his ex’s Instagram. This man uses his to, I don’t know, commune with the soil. He probably speaks to the worms. He probably has names for them.* She deleted that too. It felt too real, too close to the bone of her fascination.

For the rest of the morning, she pretended to work. The rhythmic *snick-snick-snick* of his shears was a new kind of metronome for her anxiety. Every now and then, she would risk a glance. She watched him pull a root system from the ground, a great, tangled knot of earth and life. He had to put his whole body into it, his back straining, his boots digging into the soil. When it finally came free, he stumbled back, holding the monstrous thing aloft like a trophy. He looked over toward the house then, and his eyes met hers through the glass. He didn't smile, but she saw a flicker of something in his face—pride, maybe. A shared acknowledgement of the small, savage victory. Chénelle’s heart did a strange, clumsy pirouette. She quickly looked down at her screen, her face hot, and typed: *A comedian is a person who gets paid to point out that the world is on fire. A gardener is a person who, for a much lower wage, tries to put a little bit of it out.*She looked down at the line, a stark black truth on the white screen. It wasn’t a joke, not in the traditional sense. It lacked a punchline, a clever twist. It was an observation, plain and unadorned, and it felt more honest than any of the frantic, crowd-pleasing bits she’d been trying to force for the last six months. For so long, her comedy had been a shield, a series of sharp, glittering deflections. This felt different. It felt like an opening. She left the sentence where it was, a solitary anchor in a sea of blankness.

The sun reached its zenith, burning the sky to a pale, hazy blue. The air grew thick and heavy. Inside, Chénelle nursed a second coffee she didn't want, the air conditioning humming a monotonous, artificial tune. Outside, the sounds of the garden had changed. The sharp *snick* of the shears had given way to a rhythmic, grating scrape. Mateo was on his knees now, working on the weeds that grew defiantly between the flagstones. He used a small, sharp-edged tool, moving with a patient, relentless focus that was both admirable and slightly intimidating. Every so often he would stop, sit back on his heels, and survey his progress, his head cocked as if listening to a conversation she couldn't hear.

The sheer injustice of the scene began to gnaw at her. Her, sitting in refrigerated comfort, wrestling with intangible concepts on a glowing screen, while he performed a kind of patient, sweaty alchemy under the punishing Castilian sun. It was a scene from a bad socialist play. Before she could talk herself out of it, she stood up and marched to the kitchen. The fridge yielded little more than it had that morning, but she found a dusty bottle of kas de limón and a bag of ice. It would have to do. She filled a tall glass, the ice cracking as the fizzy liquid hit it, and carried it out onto the patio, her bare feet flinching on the hot tiles.

‘Mateo,’ she called out, her voice less brittle than before. He paused, his hand halfway through pulling a stubborn weed. He rose in one fluid motion, turning to face her. He had taken off his t-shirt and hung it on the branch of a skeletal olive tree. His chest and shoulders were slick with sweat, tanned a deep brown and corded with muscle. Chénelle’s brain short-circuited for a second. The bit about the peasant with the phenomenal trapezius muscles was no longer a hacky observation; it was a documentary fact. She forced her eyes to meet his. ‘You need a break. It’s inhuman out here.’

He walked towards her, his boots silent on the stone he had just cleared. He took the glass from her hand, his calloused fingers brushing hers. The contact was brief, accidental, but it sent a ridiculous tremor up her arm. He drank deeply, his throat working, and let out a soft sigh of satisfaction. ‘Gracias,’ he said, the word a low hum. He gestured with the glass towards the now-tamed bougainvillea and the neat piles of debris. ‘It is starting to breathe again.’

‘Breathe? I thought you were performing an exorcism,’ she said, falling back on her old rhythms.

He considered this seriously for a moment. ‘No,’ he said, his voice thoughtful. ‘An exorcism is to cast something out. This all belongs here. It just… forgot its manners. You have to remind it.’ He nudged a pile of wilting green with the toe of his boot. ‘This isn’t an enemy. It just has a different idea for the space than you do. A stronger idea.’

A stronger idea. The phrase landed in Chénelle’s mind and took root. That was her problem. Her new life, this house, this success—it had a stronger idea for her than she had for it. It wanted her to be placid, content, a serene lady of the manor. She was trying to fight it, but she was losing, because she had no competing vision. Mateo wasn’t fighting the garden; he was negotiating with it, editing it, reminding it of a better version of itself.

‘So you’re a garden therapist?’ she asked, genuinely curious now.

The corner of his mouth twitched. That ghost of a smile again. ‘Something like that. You have to listen to what it’s telling you. This one,’ he gestured to the whole chaotic yard, ‘is telling me it has been lonely for a long time.’

He finished the drink and handed the glass back to her, his gaze holding hers. For the first time, she felt he wasn't just looking at her, but seeing her. Seeing the loneliness in her, perhaps, that mirrored the garden’s. The thought was so unnerving she almost took a step back. He turned away without another word and retrieved his t-shirt, pulling it back over his head before picking up his tools. The brief moment of intimacy was over. Chénelle retreated into the cool of the house, her skin prickling. She sat at her laptop, her heart thumping a strange, unfamiliar rhythm. She looked at the single sentence she had written. Then, her fingers began to move, not with the frantic energy of a comedian chasing a laugh, but with the quiet purpose of someone who had just been handed a map. She wasn't writing jokes. She was writing about a lonely garden, and the man who knew how to listen to it.The words came haltingly at first, then with a steadier flow, as if a long-blocked channel had been cleared. She described the way he’d approached the bougainvillea, not with the brute force she would have used, but with the careful consideration of a chess master planning his opening moves. She wrote about the sweat on his back, the sun catching the bronze in his hair, the worn-smooth handles of his tools. She was a comedian; her job was to find the angle, the absurdity, the twist that made it all laughable. But here, she found herself simply describing it, rendering the scene in plain, unadorned prose because the truth of it felt more potent than any punchline she could invent. The humour she found wasn't in a clever turn of phrase, but in the profound irony of her own life: a woman paid a fortune to talk, utterly silenced by a man who communicated with shears and his hands.

As the afternoon wore on, the sun began its slow descent, melting from a harsh white to a softer gold. The relentless scraping and snipping from the garden continued, a soundtrack of diligent transformation. Chénelle finally closed her laptop, the screen now filled with several pages of dense text that felt both alien and intimately hers. She walked to the glass door and looked out. The change was remarkable. The bougainvillea had been tamed, its wild limbs pruned back to reveal the elegant structure of the trellis beneath. The flagstones were clear, forming a distinct path where before there had been only a suggestion. He had carved swathes of clarity through the chaos, piling the uprooted weeds and severed branches into neat, funereal mounds. He hadn't conquered the garden; he had negotiated a truce. He had found the shape of it that had been lost underneath all the noise.

Soon, the sounds from the yard ceased. The sudden quiet was more jarring than the hours of noise had been. Chénelle saw him by the olive tree, meticulously wiping down his tools with an old rag, his movements unhurried and precise. He cleaned the soil from each blade, oiled the hinges of the shears, and placed each tool back in its designated spot within the canvas bag. There was a finality to the ritual that sent a strange pang of anxiety through her. He was leaving. This quiet, gravitational force was about to disappear from her orbit, and the thought left her feeling untethered again. She had spent the day hiding from him, and now the prospect of his absence felt like a loss.

She grabbed an envelope of cash from the kitchen drawer—more than the agency had quoted, she realised, but it felt right—and stepped back out onto the patio. The evening air was blessedly cool, carrying the green, earthy scent of cut things. He was shrugging his t-shirt back on as she approached. He turned, his face impassive, but his eyes seemed to take in the change in her, the way she stood less defensively than she had that morning.
‘It looks…’ she started, gesturing to the newly defined space, ‘…like a place a person could actually live.’
He gave his small, formal nod. ‘It needs water. A deep watering, tonight. And tomorrow.’
‘Right. Water.’ She held out the envelope. ‘Thank you, Mateo. For the… exorcism.’
He took the envelope without looking at it, his fingers brushing hers again, a spark in the cooling air. A faint line appeared between his brows. ‘It was not an exorcism, Chénelle,’ he corrected her softly, his use of her name startling her. ‘It was a conversation.’
‘Right,’ she said, her own voice quieter. ‘The conversation. When… when will you be back to continue it?’
‘Thursday,’ he said, without hesitation. ‘If that is acceptable.’
‘Yes,’ she said, a little too quickly. ‘Thursday is perfect.’

He slung his bag over one shoulder, the weight of it settling comfortably against his body. He gave one last look around the garden, a slow, appraising scan, then looked back at her. For a fleeting second, she was sure he was going to smile, a real smile that would transform his serious face entirely. But the moment passed. He just nodded again, a final, minute acknowledgement, and walked towards the gate. Chénelle stood on her patio and watched him go, the metallic clatter of the latch echoing his arrival. She was alone again, but the silence felt different. It wasn't the hollow, mocking silence of failure; it was a quiet space, waiting to be filled. She looked at the tamed anarchy of her garden, at the breathing room he had created. Then she went inside, back to the glowing screen. She had a title, a page of notes, and a story. It wasn't a joke, not yet anyway. But for the first time in a very long time, it felt like a beginning.That evening, as the last of the light bled from the sky, Chénelle uncoiled the dusty green hose from its holder on the wall. It felt alien in her hands, stiff and clumsy. She was a woman of microphones and keyboards; her tools were lightweight and digital. This thing was stubbornly physical. Following Mateo’s parting instruction, she began to water the garden. The spray of the water was a harsh hiss at first, but as it soaked into the parched earth around the bougainvillea’s roots, the sound softened to a gentle sigh. A rich, loamy smell rose up to meet her, the scent of life and decay, of things turned over and given a chance to start again. She moved slowly, deliberately, watering the patches he had cleared, the roots of the olive tree, the thirsty soil that was, for the first time, visible. It was the most honest work she had done all week, a simple, non-negotiable act of care.

The next day, Wednesday, was a day suspended in amber. The house was quiet, the garden paused in a state of half-tamed grace. Chénelle sat at her laptop, but the frantic energy was gone. She didn't try to write jokes. She simply continued the story she had started, describing the silent, sun-drenched theatre of the day before. She wrote about the contrast between her own loud, desperate performance of success and his quiet, methodical creation of order. She wrote about his hands, not as objects of lust—though that was certainly an unpublished footnote—but as instruments of a language she didn't speak. Her comedy had always been about deconstruction, about taking things apart to show the absurdity inside. Mateo’s work was the opposite. It was a careful, patient putting-together, a search for a hidden logic. She found herself typing: *He’s not a destroyer. He’s an editor. He’s looking for the sentences that already exist under all the noise.*

The shrill ring of her phone felt like a violation of the new quiet. Ricardo. Of course. She let it ring three times before answering, a small, childish act of rebellion. ‘Chénelle, mi vida,’ his voice was a long-suffering exhale. ‘Silence. From you, it is not golden. It is worrying. You have pages for me?’
‘I’m working on something new,’ she said, her eyes fixed on the garden outside.
‘New is good. Is it hungry? Is it angry? Did a politician do something stupid? Please, tell me a politician did something stupid.’
‘It’s… quieter,’ she said, testing the word. ‘It’s about paying attention.’
She could practically hear him deflating through the phone. ‘Chénelle. People don’t pay sixty euros to “pay attention.” They pay to forget. They pay to laugh so they don’t have to think. What is this, a mindfulness seminar? Where is the punchline?’
‘Maybe there isn’t one,’ she said, the words surprising her as they came out. ‘Maybe it’s just… a story.’
A long, profound sigh travelled from his office in central Madrid to her quiet house on the plains. ‘A story. Wonderful. Write your story. And when you are done with your artistic journey, write me five minutes of jokes about how hard it is to assemble IKEA furniture. That, the people will understand.’ The line went dead.

Chénelle hung up, but the familiar sting of his disapproval didn't come. Instead, she felt a strange resolve hardening in her chest. For years, she had chased the laugh, contorting her observations into neat, explosive packages for public consumption. It had brought her here, to this beautiful house where she felt like a ghost. Maybe the point wasn’t to find the punchline. Maybe it was to stand the silence that came after you told the truth. For the first time, she walked to her cavernous, empty fridge not with exhaustion, but with purpose. She made a list. Later that afternoon, she drove to the Mercadona, the aisles a bright, noisy shock after the peace of her home. She bought milk, eggs, real coffee beans, a crusty loaf of bread, fresh tomatoes, and a bag of fat, yellow lemons. She was stocking the larder, not as a statement of arrival, but as a quiet declaration that she intended to stay.

Thursday morning broke clear and bright. Chénelle was already on the patio when she heard the clatter of the gate. She wasn’t hiding. She had a tray set on the glass table with two mugs, a small pot of freshly brewed coffee, a pitcher of milk, and a bowl of sugar. It felt absurdly domestic, like she was playing a part in a play she hadn't written. When Mateo stepped through the gate, he paused. His eyes took in the scene—her, waiting, the coffee tray—and for a moment, the diagnostic calm in his expression was replaced by something else. A flicker of surprise, maybe even curiosity. He wore a different faded t-shirt, this one a soft, worn blue that matched the morning sky.
‘Hola,’ she said, her voice even. ‘I thought we could… start the conversation with coffee.’
He walked over to the table, his movements as economical as ever. He looked at the tray, then back at her. The corner of his mouth did its familiar twitch, but this time it seemed less a ghost and more a genuine preamble to a smile. ‘Negro, por favor,’ he said, his gravelly voice softer than she remembered.
She poured the dark, fragrant liquid into a mug and pushed it towards him. He wrapped his large, calloused hands around it, a study in contrast against the white ceramic. He didn’t drink right away, just held it, letting the warmth soak into his skin.
‘Today,’ he said, looking away from her and towards the next riotous section of the garden, a tangle of overgrown rosemary and something that might once have been a rose bush, ‘we work on the scent.’
‘The scent?’ she asked.
He finally took a sip of coffee, his dark honey eyes closing for a second in appreciation. ‘Un jardín,’ he said, looking back at her, his gaze direct and unnervingly clear, ‘should not only be seen. It should be smelled. It should invite you in. This one… it smells of being forgotten.’ He took another slow sip of coffee, holding her gaze over the rim of the mug. Chénelle felt the ground shift beneath her feet, a tiny, seismic adjustment. The lesson had begun.He drank the coffee in the slow, deliberate way he did everything, as if its purpose was not just to caffeinate but to be fully experienced. Chénelle found herself mirroring him, sipping her own mug without the usual frantic gulping. The silence between them was no longer a vacuum she felt compelled to fill with a joke. It was a shared space, a patch of cleared ground. The smell of being forgotten. The phrase echoed in her mind, a perfect, brutal summary of the last year. Her old material, the jokes born of desperation, had smelled of cheap beer and damp city flats. Her new, failed material smelled of nothing at all, a sterile, air-conditioned void. This garden, and Mateo’s quiet diagnosis of it, was giving a scent, a texture, to the ennui she couldn't articulate.

‘So what does a garden that invites you in smell like?’ she asked, the question genuine. Her tone was that of a student, not a client.

Mateo set his empty mug down with a soft click. ‘It depends on the garden. And the season. In this one…’ He looked toward the gnarled rosemary bush, which had grown into a dense, woody fortress. ‘It should smell of herbs under the sun. Of roses after a rain. Of the earth, breathing. It should smell of a place that is cared for.’ He stood, the moment of rest over. ‘The scent is there. It is just trapped.’ He picked up a pair of smaller, sharper shears and walked toward the rosemary. With a few decisive cuts, he began to thin the woody, unproductive growth at its core. Immediately, the air filled with the sharp, piney, resinous fragrance of the herb, a scent so vivid it was like a colour. Chénelle inhaled deeply. It was the smell of memory, of sun-drenched hillsides and sizzling pans of potatoes. It was a scent that was alive.

She didn't retreat inside this time. She took her laptop and sat at the glass table on the patio, the barrier between her world and his now porous. She didn’t feel the need to hide her watching. He was working, and now, so was she. The rhythmic snip of his shears was no longer a metronome for her anxiety, but a percussive accompaniment to the tapping of her own keys. She typed, trying to capture the sensation of that released fragrance. *He cut into the rosemary and the smell of a thousand summer kitchens rushed out. It’s the opposite of a joke. A joke is a surprise that makes you laugh. This was a surprise that made you remember.* She wrote about the idea of trapped things, of potential locked away in overgrown, neglected corners, waiting for a careful hand to release them. It wasn't comedy, not in any way Ricardo would recognise. It was an excavation.

Later, he moved to the roses. They were a pathetic sight, a thorny tangle of spindly canes with a few sad, pale leaves clinging to them. He was more brutal with them than he had been with anything else, cutting them back until they were little more than knuckled stumps jutting from the earth. Chénelle winced, feeling a strange, sympathetic pang. It looked like a massacre.
‘Are you sure they’ll survive that?’ she called out, unable to stop herself. ‘It looks like you’ve killed them.’
He stopped and wiped his brow with the back of his forearm, leaving a streak of dirt on his skin. He looked at the mangled remains of the rose bush, then at her. ‘To get new flowers, you have to be cruel to the old wood,’ he said, his voice matter-of-fact. ‘This is all tired. It has flowered already, it has no more to give. You cut it back, hard, to the strong part. You force it to make something new. It will be angry at first. But then it will bloom again. Stronger.’

The words hit her with the force of a physical blow. *You have to be cruel to the old wood.* Her old jokes, her ‘hungry Chénelle’ persona, the stories of bad dates and being broke—that was her old wood. It had flowered, it had won her this house. But it was tired. It had no more to give. Ricardo, and even she herself, had been trying to coax just one more bloom from it, and it was killing the whole plant. The impulse was so strong, so clear, that she acted on it without a second thought. She stood up and walked over to him, her laptop clutched in her hand like a shield. He watched her approach, his expression patient, his shears dangling from one hand.
‘Can I read you something?’ she asked, her heart hammering against her ribs. This was infinitely more terrifying than facing a sold-out theatre. A theatre audience was a faceless beast you could tame with a punchline. This was just one man, whose quiet judgment she had somehow come to value more than a thousand laughs.
He gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod, his eyes on her face.

Her hands trembled slightly as she tilted the screen. ‘I wrote this yesterday,’ she said, her voice thin. She cleared her throat and read aloud. ‘“A comedian is a person who gets paid to point out that the world is on fire. A gardener is a person who, for a much lower wage, tries to put a little bit of it out.”’ She stopped, the words hanging in the fragrant air between them. It felt naked, stripped of all artifice. She braced herself for confusion, for a polite but blank stare. Mateo was silent for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the brutalised rose bush. He nudged a pile of the severed, thorny canes with his boot. Then he looked back at her, and the expression in his dark honey eyes was one of pure, unclouded recognition. ‘Sí,’ he said, the single word a profound confirmation. ‘The fire is always there. You just make a space where it is safe to grow something else.’ He then turned back to the rose bush, picking up his shears as if the conversation had reached its natural and complete conclusion.

Chénelle walked back to the table on unsteady legs. He understood. He hadn’t laughed, he hadn’t offered hollow praise. He had simply listened, and understood, and in his own language, finished her thought. He had handed her the next line. She sat down and typed, her fingers flying now, the hesitation gone, replaced with a deep, resonant certainty. The fear was gone. She wasn't trying to be funny. She was trying to be honest. For the rest of the afternoon, she wrote with a focus she hadn’t felt in years, the words spooling out of her not as manufactured jokes, but as observations dug from the rich, newly-tended soil of her own backyard. She was making a space where it was safe to grow something else.## Chapter 2

When the sounds of labour finally ceased, Chénelle looked up from her laptop, blinking as her eyes adjusted to the long, slanted light of the late afternoon. The screen was no longer a blank void taunting her, but a landscape. It was filled with paragraphs that stood like newly-planted trees, lines of text that formed neat rows. It wasn't a set list of jokes; it was a narrative, a map of the last few days. It had a beginning, a middle, and the distinct feeling of a path leading somewhere she hadn't expected to go. The anxiety that had lived in her chest for months, a tight, cold knot, had loosened. It wasn't gone, but it had room to breathe.

She rose and went to the kitchen, this time moving with a sense of purpose. The lemons she had bought at the Mercadona sat in a bowl on the counter, a mound of brilliant, fragrant yellow. She sliced one in half, its sharp, clean scent cutting through the air, and squeezed the juice into two tall glasses filled with ice and cold water. It was a simple, elemental concoction, and it felt more real than any expensive bottle of wine she had bought to celebrate a success that felt hollow. Carrying the glasses, she walked back out to the patio where Mateo was performing his now-familiar, almost monastic ritual of cleaning his tools. He moved with a reverence that made her feel clumsy and loud in her own home.

‘A different kind of water,’ she said, holding one of the glasses out to him. He straightened up and took it from her, his head tilted in a silent question. ‘Lemon from the Mercadona. Not as good as from the tree, I’m sure, but it’s a start.’ He took a long drink, his eyes closing for a moment as they had with the coffee. He let out a soft sound of appreciation and looked out over the transformed garden, the cleared earth, the severely pruned roses, the thinned-out rosemary that perfumed the air around them. Then he looked at her laptop, still open on the table. ‘And you,’ he said, his voice a low rumble. ‘You have been watering, too.’

Chénelle felt a flush of heat rise in her cheeks, entirely different from the earlier embarrassment. It was the warmth of being seen, of having her own quiet, invisible labour acknowledged. ‘I’m trying to,’ she admitted. ‘I’m clearing some old wood of my own.’ He gave her a long, unreadable look, but she thought she saw that flicker of pride again, the same expression he’d had when he’d pulled the monstrous root from the ground. It was the look of a fellow craftsman acknowledging a difficult job well done. He nodded slowly, a gesture that felt less formal this time, more like an agreement. A pact.

He finished the lemonade and handed the empty glass back. Chénelle had the envelope of cash in her pocket, but the transaction felt crass now, an inadequate way to measure the day’s work. Still, it was the currency of their arrangement. She handed it to him. ‘Thank you, Mateo. For the… the lesson.’ He took the envelope and slipped it into his pocket without a glance. ‘The next lesson is more difficult,’ he said, slinging his canvas bag over his shoulder. ‘Next week, we plant. It is easy to cut things away. It is harder to choose what to put in the empty space.’ He looked from the bare patch of earth he had cleared to her, and she knew he wasn't just talking about the garden anymore. ‘Tuesday,’ he said, and it was a statement, not a question. Then he was gone, the click of the gate latch punctuating the end of their day.

The weekend that followed was unlike any Chénelle had experienced in that house. The silence didn't mock her anymore; it was productive. On Saturday morning, she took her coffee and her laptop outside and sat at the glass table, her bare feet resting on the flagstones Mateo had cleared. The air smelled of rosemary and damp earth. She wrote for hours, the story of the garden and the gardener spilling out of her, weaving into a larger story about her own life, about performance and authenticity, about the comedy of a comedian who had forgotten how to tell the truth. She found humour not in punchlines, but in juxtapositions: the ‘World’s Okayest Comedian’ mug against the profound silence of a man who spoke with shears; her public persona of the hungry, sharp-tongued city dweller against the private reality of a woman lost in a garden, being saved by a day labourer.

On Sunday, she left the laptop inside. She spent the morning watering, as instructed, watching the thirsty soil darken as it drank. She touched the brutalised rose stumps, imagining the new growth he had promised. She pulled a few small, opportunistic weeds that had dared to poke through the newly cleared earth, her hands getting dirty. The soil under her fingernails felt like a foreign substance, but not an unwelcome one. She was taking ownership, not just of the property line, but of the space itself. That evening, she sat on the patio as dusk settled, not with lukewarm coffee or a glass of wine, but with nothing, just watching the sky turn from bruised purple to inky black. The house was no longer a stage set for a life she was supposed to be living. It was starting to feel like a home.

The intrusion came on Monday, a shrill, digital spear thrown into her newfound peace. Ricardo. ‘Chénelle! I have glorious news!’ he crowed, his voice slick with the energy of a deal just closed. ‘La Chocita del Loro! Friday night! The prime slot. They want you. They need you! They need the hungry Chénelle, the killer. Sharpen your teeth, mi vida.’ La Chocita was one of the biggest clubs in Madrid, a notoriously tough room where reputations were made and broken. It was the kind of gig she used to kill for, the kind of validation she had craved. Now, the thought of it made her stomach clench. The killer Chénelle. The assassin. That felt like a lifetime ago, a different woman entirely.

‘Ricardo, I…’ she started, her eyes going to the neat, ordered rows of her garden. ‘I’m working on something new. It’s not… it’s not that.’ ‘New? New is for a tiny theatre in Malasaña with twelve hipsters and a broken microphone. This is La Chocita! They don’t want new, they want the hits! The dating app jokes, the one about your landlord, the feminism-is-a-cheese bit! Give the people what they want, Chénelle. It’s a simple transaction.’ She thought of Mateo’s hands, cleaning his tools. She thought of his words about the empty space, about how hard it was to choose what to put there. She could fill it with the old, easy, familiar things. Or she could risk planting something new, something that might not bloom, but that felt true. ‘I’ll do the gig,’ she said, and heard Ricardo let out a sigh of relief. ‘But I’m doing the new material.’ The silence on the other end of the line was immediate and absolute. It was a silence far heavier than the one she shared with her gardener. ‘Chénelle,’ he finally said, his voice dangerously quiet. ‘Don’t be a fool. Don’t commit career suicide on the biggest stage in the city.’ But the decision had been made, a root had taken hold. ‘I have to be cruel to the old wood, Ricardo,’ she said, and hung up before he could reply, her heart pounding with a terrifying, exhilarating sense of purpose.## Chapter 3

The day after her declaration of war to Ricardo, Tuesday arrived. Chénelle heard the now-familiar sound of the gate and felt a nervous flutter that had nothing to do with trapezius muscles and everything to do with her impending, self-inflicted public execution. Mateo didn’t carry his bag of sharp, destructive tools this time. Instead, he carried two wooden trays filled with dozens of tiny green shoots in black plastic cells, and a large, hessian sack that smelled richly of peat and damp earth. He was not here to cut away; he was here to add. The thought sent a fresh wave of anxiety through her. It was easy to cut things away. It was harder to choose what to put in the empty space.

She met him on the patio, a mug of coffee in her hand as an offering. He accepted it with a nod, his eyes already scanning the newly cleared patches of earth. ‘Lavender,’ he said, gesturing with his chin toward one of the trays. ‘For the sun, and the smell. And thyme. To grow between the stones. It is strong. It does not mind being stepped on.’ He knelt, setting the tray on the ground, and ran his hand over the patch of bare soil he had prepared last week. He tested its texture between his thumb and forefinger, his expression one of intense concentration, as if he were reading a complex manuscript. Chénelle found herself kneeling on the other side of the patch, an instinctive move to be closer to the work. Her knees protested against the hard flagstone, a discomfort that felt grounding.

‘How do you know it will grow here?’ she asked, her voice quiet. He picked up a small trowel and began to dig a series of small, perfect holes in the dark earth. ‘You don’t,’ he said, without looking up. ‘You give it the best chance. Good soil, water, sun. The rest is the plant’s decision.’ He gently eased a tiny lavender shoot from its plastic cell, its roots a delicate, tangled web. ‘The hole must be twice as wide as the root ball,’ he instructed, placing it in the earth. ‘So the roots do not feel like they are in a prison. They need room to decide which way to go.’ He began filling the soil in around it, his large hands surprisingly gentle, firming the earth around the fragile stem.

Her own throat felt tight, a prison for the words she needed to say. She took a breath, the air thick with the scents of coffee and soil. ‘Mateo, I have a show on Friday.’ He continued his work, his rhythm unbroken. ‘A big one. And I told my agent I’m not doing the old jokes.’ She watched his hands as she spoke. ‘I’m… I’m trying to plant something new. And I think… I think the soil is bad and the sun won’t shine and I’m going to kill it before it even has a chance.’ The confession tumbled out, raw and unpolished, a weed she had just ripped from her own chest. He finished planting the lavender shoot and moved to the next one, his focus absolute. For a moment, she thought he hadn’t heard her, or had chosen to ignore the embarrassing, unprofessional display.

Then he paused, trowel halfway to the earth, and looked at her. His dark honey eyes were serious, holding none of the pity she dreaded. ‘Chénelle,’ he said, his voice the low, steady hum of the earth itself. ‘When you put a seed in the ground, you do not know what will happen. A bird might eat it. It might get too much rain, or not enough. It might be crowded by weeds.’ He gestured to the rows of tiny shoots. ‘But the seed does not worry about the bird or the rain. It only knows it must try to grow. That is all. The trying is the job. The flower is a gift.’ He turned back to his work, digging the next hole. The trying is the job. The flower is a gift. It was the most profound and practical piece of advice she had ever received. It was a release. She was not responsible for the applause. She was only responsible for the trying.

The days leading up to Friday were a strange mix of terror and calm. She spent her time on the patio, the laptop open in front of her. But instead of frantically typing and deleting, she shaped her story. She moved paragraphs around like Mateo moved stones, finding a more natural path. She read the words aloud, not to a mirror, but to the rows of newly planted lavender and thyme. The garden was her first audience, and it was a patient one. It did not demand a punchline every ten seconds. It simply listened, absorbing her words along with the sun and water. She found the rhythm of the piece, not in the staccato beat of setup-punch, but in the slower, more deliberate cadence of a story unfolding. She was not a machine gun firing off jokes; she was a gardener, tending a narrative.

On Friday afternoon, she drove from the arid plains into the dense, concrete cacophony of Madrid. The quiet of her home, filled with the scent of rosemary and the hum of bees, gave way to the shriek of sirens and the smell of diesel. It felt like travelling to a different country, one whose language she was no longer fluent in. She parked in a cramped underground garage and walked to La Chocita del Loro, her stomach a cold, tight knot. Backstage was a cramped, chaotic space that smelled of stale beer and desperation. Ricardo was there, his face pale, his expensive suit looking rumpled. He looked like a grief-stricken funeral director about to present a eulogy for a career he had once loved. ‘Chénelle,’ he whispered, grabbing her arm. ‘It is not too late. I have the old set list on a cue card. Ten minutes. In and out. No one gets hurt.’

‘Someone gets hurt, Ricardo,’ she said, gently pulling her arm away. ‘Me.’ He looked at her, his eyes full of genuine fear for her. ‘They will eat you alive. This is not a poetry reading. This is a bear pit. They want blood.’ ‘Then they’ll get it,’ she said. ‘Just not the way they’re used to.’ The stage manager called her name. Her heart hammered against her ribs. She thought of Mateo’s hands in the dirt, of the tiny lavender shoots, of the promise of a scent that was not yet there but could be. The trying is the job. She walked from the dim chaos of the wings into the blinding white light of the stage.

The applause was loud, expectant. She saw the faces in the darkness, turned up towards her like hungry flowers. She walked to the microphone, her heels clicking on the stage, the sound ridiculously loud in her own ears. She didn't open with a joke. She opened with the silence. She just stood there for a beat, letting the rowdy energy of the room settle, letting them see her. ‘My garden was a joke without a punchline,’ she began, her voice quieter than they expected, forcing them to lean in. There was a ripple of confusion through the crowd. A few people exchanged glances. A man in the front row checked his phone. The silence was not the respectful quiet of a theatre; it was a heavy, uncooperative blanket. She could feel Ricardo’s panic radiating from the wings.

She kept going, her voice steady. She told them about the bougainvillea, about the weeds as thick as a wrestler’s wrist. She told them about success feeling like being sanded down, about her well-fed ennui. She wasn't asking for a laugh; she was laying a foundation, planting a seed in the dark. Then she described hiding from the gardener, the peasant with the phenomenal trapezius muscles. A few people chuckled, not a big laugh, but a short, sharp bark of recognition. It was the sound of truth, not a punchline. She felt a subtle shift in the room's energy. They were beginning to listen differently. She told them about his tools, about his diagnosis of the garden’s loneliness, about how he was there not for an exorcism, but a conversation.

She didn't look at the crowd as a beast to be tamed, but as a collection of lonely gardens. She took a breath and delivered the line that had become the root ball of her entire story. ‘A comedian is a person who gets paid to point out that the world is on fire,’ she said, her voice clear and strong. ‘I realised I’d hired a gardener who, for a much lower wage, was trying to put a little bit of it out.’ The room went utterly still. It was a silence she had never heard before in a comedy club. It was not the silence of confusion or boredom. It was the silence of held breath, of collective thought. And then, it broke. Not with a roar of laughter, but with a wave of applause. It started with a few people, then spread through the entire room. It wasn't the explosive, desperate applause of people who had just been given a release valve. It had weight. It had texture. It was the sound of recognition. She stood in the warm wash of the lights and the sound, and for the first time on a stage, she didn't feel like a killer. She felt the quiet, steady warmth of a gardener who had just seen the first green shoot break through the soil.The applause subsided, leaving behind a silence that was utterly changed. It was no longer a hostile void but a shared, attentive space. Chénelle’s fear had dissolved, replaced by a clear, calm focus. She took them further into her story, her voice now imbued with a quiet confidence. She told them about Mateo’s brutal pruning of the rose bushes, and her own horror at the apparent destruction. ‘It looked like a massacre,’ she confessed to the dark room. ‘I thought he was killing them.’ She paused, letting the image settle. ‘And he looked at me, this man who speaks in soil and seasons, and he said, “To get new flowers, you have to be cruel to the old wood. You force it to make something new.”’ A ripple of knowing laughter went through the audience, a sound deeper and more resonant than the sharp barks she was used to. It was the laughter of people who understood what it felt like to be stuck, to be clinging to something tired and dead, too afraid to cut it back and trust in new growth.

She didn't tell jokes about dating apps or politicians. Instead, she talked about learning to water a thirsty plant, about the surprising weight of a bag of soil, about the smell of rosemary released by a sharp blade. She told them about her conversation with Ricardo, about his demand for the ‘hits’, and her own quiet decision to hang up. She turned her own artistic crisis into the material, laying her vulnerability bare on the stage. The humor wasn't in punchlines; it was in the profound, relatable absurdity of her situation. She was a professional loudmouth being taught the value of silence, a successful performer discovering that her greatest success was happening quietly in her own backyard, witnessed only by a man who communicated in horticultural metaphors. She finished her set by talking about the tiny lavender shoots, the empty spaces, and the terror of choosing what to plant. ‘I don’t know if it will work,’ she said, her voice dropping to an almost conversational tone. ‘I don’t know if any of it will bloom. But he told me the trying is the job. The flower is a gift.’ She looked out into the darkness. ‘So, this was me, trying. Thank you.’

She walked off the stage, the sound of the applause following her like a warm tide. It was different from any ovation she had ever received. It was not a demand for more, but an expression of gratitude. Backstage, the usual clamor was subdued. A couple of the other comics, guys who usually traded cynical barbs with her, just nodded, their expressions a mixture of confusion and respect. Ricardo was standing by the door to her dressing room, his arms crossed, his face a mask of bewilderment. He looked like he had just witnessed a strange and inexplicable weather event. He didn't speak until she was right in front of him. ‘I don’t understand what that was,’ he said, his voice flat. ‘They weren't laughing at the right places.’

‘Maybe they were the right places after all,’ Chénelle replied, feeling a strange sense of calm. She was no longer seeking his approval. ‘It wasn’t a bear pit, Ricardo. It was a room full of people.’
‘It was a miracle,’ he breathed, shaking his head in disbelief. ‘They should have destroyed you. But they… listened.’ He uncrossed his arms, a gesture of surrender. ‘The owner of the club came to me. He said he’s never seen a room that quiet. He wants you back. He said, “Bring back the garden woman.”’ Ricardo looked at her, his agent’s brain trying to process this new, unmarketable commodity. ‘“The Garden Woman.” What am I supposed to do with that? It sounds like a brand of fertilizer.’ Chénelle laughed, a genuine, unforced laugh that came from deep in her belly. She reached out and patted his arm. ‘It’s a start, Ricardo. It’s a start.’

The drive home was a slow unwinding. The glaring lights and aggressive traffic of Madrid receded in her rearview mirror, replaced by the dark, open expanse of the plains. She drove with the windows down, letting the cool night air rush in, smelling of dust and distant fields. She wasn't high on adrenaline, as she usually was after a big show. Instead, she felt a profound sense of peace, a quiet alignment of her inner and outer worlds. She had walked onto that stage as one person and walked off as another. The fear of failure, the desperate need for validation, the feeling of being an imposter in her own life—it had all been tilled back into the soil of her performance. She had not been destroyed. She had listened to the space, found its story, and told the truth. The flower was a gift.

When she finally pulled into her driveway, the house was dark and silent. But it wasn't the hollow silence of before. It was a watchful, waiting quiet. Instead of going inside, she walked around to the back, to the patio. The moon was high and almost full, casting a pale, silver light over the garden. The neat rows of lavender and thyme were tiny, dark lines against the silvery earth. The pruned bougainvillea was a stark, beautiful silhouette against the wall. The air was cool and fragrant. She stood on the tiles where she had once surveyed the green anarchy with despair, and now she saw only potential. She saw the shape of things to come. The garden was no longer a joke without a punchline. It was a story, her story, and she was finally learning how to tell it.## Chapter 4

The morning after the show, Chénelle woke not to the jangling buzz of adrenaline and self-critique, but to the slow, golden creep of sunlight across her bedroom floor. The memory of the applause was still there, but it wasn't a loud, roaring echo. It was a low, resonant hum inside her, like a cello string that had been perfectly played and was still vibrating. For the first time in that house, she felt truly rested, as if some long-held tension in her muscles had finally released its grip in the night. She made coffee—real coffee, from the beans she’d ground herself—and walked out onto the patio. The air was cool and carried the scents he had promised, the sharp, clean perfume of rosemary and the sweeter, herbal note of the young lavender plants. She took a deep breath, and it felt like she was inhaling peace.

Her relationship with the garden had fundamentally changed. It was no longer a hostile entity to be managed by a hired professional, nor was it merely a source of metaphors for her act. It was a collaborator. That weekend, she didn't just water it as a chore. She spent hours outside, her hands in the dirt, pulling the small, tenacious weeds that surfaced around her newly planted herbs. She learned to distinguish the feel of a weed's shallow, grasping root from the deeper, more established presence of the plants that belonged. It was slow, meticulous work, and it quieted her mind in a way that no sold-out show ever had. She was tending the space, participating in its transformation, and in doing so, was tending to the newly cleared ground within herself.

When Tuesday came, she felt a flicker of anticipation that was purer and simpler than the nervous energy he had first inspired. It was the feeling of waiting for a friend. She didn't hide or pretend to work. She set the glass table on the patio for a simple lunch: a loaf of crusty bread, a wedge of Manchego cheese, a bowl of ripe tomatoes she’d drizzled with olive oil and salt. It was an offering of shared sustenance, a gesture that went beyond client and labourer. When she heard the clatter of the gate, she was already standing there, a pitcher of water beaded with condensation in her hand. Mateo walked in, carrying a small, flat-bladed hoe she hadn’t seen before, and he stopped when he saw the table. The corner of his mouth did more than twitch; it lifted into a definite, if small, smile that transformed the stern geography of his face. It made him look younger, more approachable.

‘Hola, Chénelle,’ he said, his voice holding a new warmth. He set the tool down and approached the table. She poured him a glass of water, and they sat in the comfortable silence for a moment, the two of them looking out at the evidence of their shared work. The lavender had perked up, the thyme was beginning to form a soft green carpet between a few of the stones. Life was visibly, quietly happening. ‘I have to tell you something,’ she began, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass. ‘I did the show. On Friday.’ He nodded, his gaze steady, waiting. ‘I didn't do the old jokes. I told them… I told them about the garden. About you. I told them what you said about being cruel to the old wood.’

He listened, his expression unchanging, as she tried to translate the experience. She didn't talk about career suicide or stage presence. She spoke of the quality of the silence in the room, the way it had changed from a hostile vacuum to a space of deep listening. ‘It wasn't a big, roaring laugh, Mateo. It was something else. It was like… a hundred people sighing in relief at the same time. It was the sound of recognition.’ She looked at him, hoping he would understand. ‘I think,’ she finished softly, ‘I made a space where it was safe to grow something else.’ He considered her words for a long moment, his eyes on the distant, hazy line of the horizon. Then he looked back at her, his gaze clear and direct. ‘The earth was thirsty,’ he said simply. ‘You gave it water.’

That day, the boundary between them seemed to dissolve completely. They ate the simple lunch at the table, the conversation moving from the garden to their own lives. He told her about growing up in a small village in Galicia, a place of constant green and soft rain, and how he had to learn the language of this hard, dry Castilian soil when he moved here years ago. He spoke of plants not as decoration, but as characters with stubborn personalities. In turn, she told him about her cramped flat in Lavapiés, the claustrophobia that had driven her to seek this wide-open space, and the strange loneliness she found waiting for her when she arrived. They were just two people, sharing bread and stories under the Spanish sun, their hands bearing the similar stains of their respective crafts—hers from ink and keyboard, his from soil and chlorophyll.

After lunch, he took the new, flat-bladed hoe and showed her its purpose. He worked it back and forth just under the surface of the unplanted soil, slicing the roots of emerging weeds before they had a chance to take hold. ‘This is the next lesson,’ he explained, passing the tool to her. ‘Some things you must pull out by the root, the big, angry ones. But others… others you can deal with when they are small and have no power. It is easier work. You just have to be paying attention.’ She took the tool, its wooden handle smooth and warm from his grip, and mimicked his steady, rhythmic motion. It was a subtle, meditative task, requiring focus but not brute force. It was about prevention, not cure. It was about knowing your terrain so well you could see the trouble coming from a mile away.

She was still scraping gently at the earth late that afternoon when her phone, which she’d left on the table, began to buzz violently, a frantic, mechanical insect disrupting the peace. It was Ricardo. She ignored it, but it immediately began buzzing again. With a sigh, she picked it up. ‘Chénelle, mi amor, mi estrella, my Garden Woman!’ he shouted, his voice vibrating with manic, commercial energy. ‘I have been on the phone all day! We have offers! A weekly column for *El País Semanal*—they want your garden philosophy! A publisher wants to meet about a book—I’m thinking *The Punchline is in the Petunias*! And a production company wants to develop a podcast! We can sell branded trowels! We will be rich, Chénelle, rich!’ He paused for a dramatic breath. ‘The people are hungry for authenticity! And we are going to package it up and sell it to them by the kilo!’ Chénelle looked from the phone in her hand to the quiet, steadfast man working a few feet away from her. She saw the small, delicate lavender plants, and she heard Mateo's voice in her head: *Some things you can deal with when they are small and have no power.* A new weed was sprouting, right in the middle of her freshly cleared ground. And it was growing terrifyingly fast.The phone felt slick and alien in her hand, a conduit for a world she had just begun to shed. She looked at Mateo, who had paused his work for a moment to take a drink of water, his back to her, a calm silhouette against the burgeoning life of the garden. He was a continent of peace. Ricardo’s voice, crackling with a frenetic energy she now recognised as a kind of panic, was the invading fleet, loud and rapacious. She watched as Mateo knelt again, resuming the patient, rhythmic scraping of the earth, unconcerned with the frantic buzzing of the world outside this small, ordered patch of land. He was dealing with his weeds; it was time for her to deal with hers.

‘Ricardo,’ she said, her voice so quiet he had to stop his torrent of words to hear her. ‘Listen to me. A garden doesn’t grow faster if you scream at it.’ There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end of the line. ‘What? Chénelle, this isn’t a garden, this is a gold mine! We have momentum! We have to move now, before the next “authentic” voice comes along!’

‘No,’ she said, the word simple and solid. She watched her own hand, the one not holding the phone, as it rested on the warm earth beside her. ‘A podcast? Branded trowels? Ricardo, you are talking about building a factory on fertile ground before we even know what the harvest is. You will poison the soil.’ She could feel his confusion and mounting frustration vibrating through the phone. This was not a language he understood. He dealt in contracts, in market shares, in exploiting a moment. He did not understand the slow, non-negotiable pace of growth.

‘So what, you want me to tell them no? To tell *El País* to wait? To tell a publisher you’re too busy contemplating a daisy to write a book? They will not wait, Chénelle! The world will not wait for you!’

‘Then let it go on without me for a little while,’ she said, a profound sense of calm settling over her. ‘Tell them I am tending to my source material. Tell them the Garden Woman is in her garden. If they want the story, they have to wait for it to grow.’ She ended the call before he could launch another assault, placing the phone face down on the flagstones as if to smother it. The silence that rushed back in was beautiful and clean. She took a deep breath, the scent of thyme filling her lungs, and picked up the flat-bladed hoe. She went back to work beside Mateo, the scrape of her tool against the earth joining his in a quiet, steady rhythm. He didn’t ask what the call was about. He didn’t need to. He simply worked alongside her, a silent confirmation that this, the patient work right in front of them, was the only thing that mattered.

They worked until the sun began to dip low, painting the sky in the furious sunset colours of the old bougainvillea. As Mateo gathered his things, performing his ritual of care, Chénelle stood and brushed the dirt from her knees. The anxiety from Ricardo’s call had dissipated, replaced by a quiet resolve. ‘Mateo,’ she said, as he prepared to leave. ‘What do you do when a plant is an invasive species? Something that grows too fast and tries to take over everything?’

He paused, his hand on the strap of his bag, and considered the question seriously. ‘Some you must pull out, again and again. It is a long fight. But some…’ He looked toward the bougainvillea, now a tamed and graceful version of its former self. ‘Some you do not fight. You give them a strong trellis, a firm boundary. You show them where their space is. You teach them how to climb without killing everything else. You give them a shape. Sometimes, even an aggressive plant can be beautiful, if it learns its limits.’

He left her with that thought, a final, perfectly placed seed. She watched him go, the click of the latch a familiar punctuation mark. She was alone, but the house felt full, her mind clear. She walked inside, leaving the dirt and the scents of the garden behind, and sat at her laptop. She didn’t open the document with her new show. She opened a new, blank email. The recipient was Ricardo. She began to type, not with anger or frustration, but with the calm, diagnostic intelligence she had learned from watching her gardener. She was not firing her agent. She was not quitting her career. She was giving her success a trellis, a firm boundary. She was showing it where its space was, teaching it how to climb without killing the fragile, authentic thing she had just discovered. It was a declaration of her own terms, a blueprint for a new kind of structure, one that had room for both the quiet work of the garden and the bright lights of the stage.## Chapter 5

The days that followed her email to Ricardo were suspended in a strange, anticipatory silence. Chénelle expected a digital explosion, a barrage of frantic calls and threatening emails, but none came. The silence from Madrid was so absolute it was unnerving, like the eerie calm before a storm. She spent her mornings in the garden, the cool metal of the hoe in her hands, her mind half-expecting the shriek of Ricardo’s expensive car tires on the gravel outside. But the only sounds were the buzz of bees investigating the burgeoning lavender and the scrape of her own tool against the earth. The work became her anchor. She was no longer just following Mateo’s instructions; she was learning to read the land herself. She learned the subtle shift in the soil’s colour that meant it was thirsty, the particular way a weed’s leaves drooped just before it gave up its hold. The garden was teaching her its language, a vernacular of sun, water, and patience.

Weeks turned into a month, and a new rhythm established itself, as steady and natural as a season turning. Tuesdays were for working with Mateo, their sessions now a comfortable collaboration. He would arrive with a new offering—a bag of worm castings, a bundle of tomato stakes—and she would have coffee and a question waiting. Their conversations meandered from the best way to deter snails to the strange nature of fame, each finding the other’s world as exotic and baffling as their own. On other days, she wrote. The panic was gone, replaced by a slow, observational clarity. She filled pages not with jokes, but with the texture of her new life: the particular satisfaction of pulling a long taproot, the comic tragedy of a beetle falling into the water basin, the profound quiet of a man who could listen to a plant. Her story was growing organically, its roots twisting deep into the soil of her own backyard.

One Tuesday, Mateo arrived not with a tool, but with a small, woven basket. Inside, nestled on a clean cloth, were a half-dozen purple figs, their skins so delicate they were almost translucent, glistening with a drop of sugary sap at their tips. They were, he explained, from a tree his grandfather had planted in Galicia and brought a cutting from when he moved, a tree that was not supposed to thrive in the dry heat of Madrid but did so out of sheer stubbornness. They sat at her glass table and ate them, the syrupy sweetness a burst of flavour so intense it felt like a memory. Chénelle found herself telling him about her own grandmother, a woman who had lived in a tiny apartment in Lavapiés and whose only garden was a row of wilting geraniums on a windowsill overlooking a noisy street. She told him how her grandmother had called the pots her ‘balcony of dreams.’ Mateo listened, his gaze fixed on her face, and when she finished, he simply nodded. 'Everyone needs a piece of earth,' he said. 'Even if it is just a pot on a balcony.' In that moment, the distance between the famed comedian and the quiet gardener vanished completely, leaving only two grandchildren sharing a story.

The inevitable intrusion came not as a storm, but as a sleek, black German car crawling up her dusty drive, looking as out of place as a shark in a fishpond. Ricardo emerged, dressed in a black linen suit, his face hidden behind designer sunglasses. He looked less like an agent and more like a Hollywood producer scouting a rustic film location. He approached the patio, where Chénelle was on her knees tying up a rebellious tomato vine, with the cautious air of someone trying not to get his shoes dirty. In his hand, he held not a phone, but a glossy, leather-bound portfolio. Mateo, who was turning compost at the far end of the garden, paused his work, leaning on his pitchfork, a silent, watchful sentinel. Ricardo ignored him, focusing his entire, high-wattage attention on Chénelle. 'Mi vida,' he began, his voice dangerously smooth. 'I have listened. I have meditated on your… new direction. I have created a trellis.' He opened the portfolio on her glass table with a flourish.

Inside was a vision of her future, packaged and shrink-wrapped. There were mock-ups for a book cover titled *The Tao of the Trowel*, featuring a picture of her, artfully dirt-smudged, laughing into the middle distance. There was a logo for a lifestyle brand, *La Vida Verde de Chénelle*, with a stylized microphone intertwined with a leafy vine. There was a proposal for a television series, a sort of celebrity gardening show where she would visit the sad gardens of other famous people and dispense folksy wisdom while a team of unseen professionals did the actual work. It was a perfect, soulless caricature of everything she had discovered. It was an attempt to mass-produce the scent of her rosemary, to bottle the sweetness of Mateo’s figs. It was an invasive species, engineered in a lab, designed for rapid, aggressive growth. She looked from the glossy pages to her own hands, dirt caked under the nails, and felt a profound wave of nausea.

‘Ricardo,’ she said, her voice quiet but firm as she closed the portfolio. ‘This isn’t a trellis. This is a cage.’ He took off his sunglasses, his eyes pleading. ‘It is a structure! It is a way to give the people what they want, but on your terms! Authenticity, Chénelle, but with a marketing budget!’ From the corner of her eye, she saw Mateo calmly resume his work, turning the dark, rich compost over and over, transforming decay into life. His steady, rhythmic movements were a counterpoint to Ricardo’s frantic sales pitch. ‘The people don’t want a lifestyle brand, Ricardo. They want a story. And a story is a living thing. You can’t force it into a shape it hasn’t grown into yet. If you do, it dies.’ She pushed the portfolio back across the table towards him. ‘I’m not selling fertilizer, Ricardo. I’m growing a garden. And so is my audience. You need to let us do the work.’

He stared at her, then at the closed portfolio, a flicker of something—was it admiration? or just utter defeat?—in his eyes. He slumped into a chair, all the air going out of him. ‘I don’t know how to sell that,’ he confessed, his voice small. ‘I only know how to sell a product.’ As if on cue, a sudden, sharp gust of wind rattled the olive tree, and Chénelle noticed something she had missed in her focus on Ricardo. The leaves of her proud tomato plants were stippled with tiny yellow spots, and on the undersides, she could see them: a thriving, insidious colony of whiteflies, rising in a tiny, spectral cloud as the wind shook the leaves. Her heart sank. A pestilence. Right when she was trying to fend off a different kind. A wave of despair washed over her; maybe it was all too fragile. Maybe Ricardo was right. Maybe everything, eventually, got monetized or eaten by bugs.

She must have made a sound, because Mateo stopped his work and walked over. He looked not at Ricardo, but at the tomato plants, his eyes instantly diagnostic. He gently turned a leaf over with his calloused finger. ‘Ah,’ he said, his voice a low rumble. ‘The mosca blanca. They love a plant that is comfortable.’ He looked from the pests to Ricardo, who was staring at him as if he were an exotic specimen, then back to Chénelle. He saw the flicker of despair in her eyes. ‘It is not a tragedy,’ he said to her, his voice calm and reassuring. ‘It is just part of the conversation. The garden is telling us it is healthy enough to be a feast. Now, we must tell the flies that they are not invited to dinner.’ He didn’t reach for a chemical spray. He walked to the tap and began explaining to her, and only to her, the simple, patient process of mixing soap and water, of spraying the leaves, of breaking the cycle. The work was the answer. Always, the work. Ricardo sat in his expensive linen suit, a ghost at the feast, watching as Chénelle, the star he was trying to package, nodded seriously and began to prepare for her small, quiet, necessary war.The world, for a moment, shrank to the size of a single tomato leaf. Ricardo, his portfolio of a manufactured future lying forgotten on the table, watched in stupefied silence. He was a man who solved problems with contracts, with leveraged buyouts, with aggressive marketing campaigns that carpet-bombed the public consciousness. He had just witnessed a crisis—an infestation that threatened the very source of Chénelle’s new material—and the proposed solution was dish soap. It was absurd. It was biblical. He watched as Mateo patiently demonstrated how to mix the solution, how to test a single leaf first, how to spray the undersides where the pests hid. Chénelle listened with an un-ironic intensity that Ricardo had never seen in her, not even when negotiating a television deal. She was a student again, her fame and wit irrelevant in the face of this tiny, winged plague. Ricardo saw his glossy proposals for what they were: a chemical pesticide, designed to create a sterile, profitable monoculture. What he was witnessing here was something else entirely, a kind of holistic, patient combat. It was, he had to admit, a much better story.

When they were done, Chénelle’s hands were sticky with soap and her brow was furrowed in concentration. She looked over at Ricardo, who hadn’t moved, his expensive suit now looking like a foolish costume. He seemed smaller, drained of his usual manic energy. ‘So,’ he said, his voice raspy, a pale imitation of its usual boom. ‘Soap. That’s the answer?’ He wasn’t just talking about the whiteflies. He was talking about the book deals, the podcasts, the entire glittering, hollow structure he had proposed. ‘It’s the answer for now,’ Chénelle said, wiping her hands on an old rag. ‘It’s quiet. It takes time. You have to do it again in a few days. You have to keep paying attention. It’s not a magic bullet, Ricardo. It’s just work.’ The word hung in the air between them, simple and unadorned. Work. For years, they had called what they did ‘the business.’ This was something different. Mateo, having given them the diagnosis and the prescription, quietly gathered his actual tools, granting them the privacy of their own strange ecosystem.

Ricardo finally stood, but he didn’t pick up his portfolio. He walked over to the edge of the patio and looked out at the garden, at the rows of lavender and the determined thyme, at the staked tomatoes now glistening with soap solution. ‘The trying is the job,’ he murmured, quoting a line he had surely heard from Chénelle’s triumphant show. He turned back to her, and for the first time, she saw not an agent but the man he’d been before, a young guy from Asturias who had loved comedy because it told the truth. ‘Okay,’ he said, with the finality of a man signing a treaty of surrender. ‘No branded trowels. I… I think I understand. The trellis… it shouldn’t be the main attraction. It just needs to be strong enough to hold the plant.’ He paused, his mind, for once, not racing ahead to the profit margin. ‘What if… what if we start small? A few shows, in small theatres, in places with their own gardens. We don’t announce them. People find them. And the book… you just write it. When it’s done, it’s done. We find a publisher who will wait for the harvest.’

Chénelle felt a smile spread across her face, slow and genuine. He had heard her. In his own transactional, bottom-line way, he had finally understood. It wasn't a perfect solution, and she knew he would still talk in terms of demographics and engagement, but the fundamental shift had happened. He was willing to let the thing grow at its own pace. ‘That,’ she said, ‘sounds like a trellis I can climb.’ At that moment, Mateo walked past them on his way to the gate. He paused, looked at the resolved, peaceful expression on Chénelle’s face, then at Ricardo’s humbled posture. He gave a single, slow nod that encompassed them all, a silent blessing on the new accord, before letting himself out, the click of the latch sounding like a final, satisfying chord.

The summer deepened, ripening the world. The soapy water worked. Chénelle sprayed the tomatoes with a gardener’s diligence, and the whiteflies, deprived of an easy feast, dwindled and vanished. In their place, the fruit swelled, turning from hard green to a blushing orange and finally to a deep, glorious red. Her writing flourished in tandem. The stories came easily now, rooted in the daily dramas of the garden—the war with the whiteflies became a ten-minute meditation on facing overwhelming problems with small, consistent acts of resistance. The surprise blooming of a volunteer sunflower that had hitchhiked in the compost became a story about unexpected beauty. The garden gave her a new narrative, not just for the stage, but for her life. She did a few of Ricardo’s proposed ‘secret shows’ in towns she’d never heard of, turning up at small cultural centres and libraries. The audiences were not the baying crowds of the city clubs, but collections of curious, quiet listeners. They laughed at the absurdity, but they nodded at the truths. They were not consumers of a product; they were fellow gardeners, tending their own patches of earth.

Autumn arrived, not with a sudden chill, but as a slow, golden exhalation. The fierce Castilian sun gentled, the days grew shorter, and the air took on a crisp, sweet edge. The harvest was abundant. Baskets of tomatoes and peppers filled her kitchen, and the scent of drying herbs hung in the air. Her work with Mateo changed. The frantic planting and weeding gave way to the slower tasks of collecting seeds, turning the soil for its winter rest, and pruning the last of the year’s growth. Their conversations grew quieter, more intimate, the silences between them as rich and fertile as the compost pile. One cool evening, they sat on the patio steps, a shared blanket across their knees, shelling the last of the dried beans from their brittle pods. The rhythmic clicking of the beans dropping into a metal bowl was the only sound. The work was done. The garden was settling in for its long sleep.

Chénelle looked at Mateo’s hands, no longer just instruments of transformation in her garden, but a familiar, comforting presence in her life. She thought of the first day she had seen him, a silent, intimidating force of nature she had spied on from behind a pillar. Now, the idea of her life without his quiet, steady gravity was unimaginable. The loneliness he had come to vanquish was not just in her garden, but in her. He turned his head and found her watching him, his dark honey eyes soft in the twilight. He didn’t need to ask what she was thinking. He had been listening to her, as he listened to everything, for months. With a slow, deliberate motion that was as natural as a plant turning toward the sun, he reached out and took her hand, his calloused thumb gently stroking the back of hers. It was not a question, but a statement. It was a harvest. Chénelle leaned her head against his shoulder, her breath mingling with the cool autumn air, which smelled of tired earth and new beginnings. The house was no longer a statement of arrival. The garden was no longer a joke. They were, she realized, simply home.## Chapter 6

Winter came to the plains not as a gentle blanket of snow but as a sharpening of the world. The air grew crystalline and sharp, carrying the scent of cold earth and distant woodsmoke. The sky, once a hazy, sun-bleached blue, became a deep, brilliant azure that made the bare branches of the olive tree look like a line drawing. In the garden, the vibrant anarchy of summer had given way to a stark, elegant peace. The skeletons of the tomato vines stood in their neat rows, the lavender was a smudge of silver-grey against the dark soil, and the flagstones, once choked with insolent weeds, were now just a quiet path leading from the patio to the back gate. The world outside had gone dormant, and in response, the life of the house had drawn inward, becoming warmer and more concentrated.

Mateo’s presence was no longer demarcated by specific days or tasks. The end of the primary gardening season had not meant the end of his work, but its transformation. He was there most days now, his quiet gravity a constant, steadying force in the home. He turned out to be a carpenter of the same school as he was a gardener, approaching a loose floorboard or a sticking window frame with the same diagnostic calm he had once reserved for the bougainvillea. He worked with old, inherited tools, sanding and planing, bringing a quiet, functional order to the internal structure of the house just as he had to its external landscape. The sounds of Chénelle’s world changed from the snip of shears to the rhythmic rasp of a wood file, from the thud of a hoe to the gentle tap of a hammer, but the harmony remained the same. Two creators, working in tandem in their shared space.

While he worked with wood and brass, she worked with words. The glass table on the patio was abandoned for a small, sturdy desk he had built for her and placed by the fireplace. The fire he lit each morning crackled and hissed, a domestic counterpoint to the sharp silence of the plains outside. The book—no longer a terrifying void but a familiar landscape—grew under her fingers. She had found its title one crisp afternoon, watching him prune the last of the deadwood from the roses: *Cruel to the Old Wood*. It felt right. It was a title that held both the violence of change and the promise of new blooms. Her writing had a new confidence, a patience she had learned from him. She was no longer chasing the laugh; she was building a story, fitting sentences together with the careful joinery of a master craftsman, ensuring each one was true and strong enough to bear the weight of what came next.

One afternoon, as he was carefully re-hanging a kitchen cabinet door so that it no longer sighed every time it was opened, she read a passage aloud to him. It was about her grandmother’s geraniums on the balcony in Lavapiés, about the fierce, improbable hope contained in those small, terracotta pots. When she finished, he was silent for a long time, wiping his hands on a rag. He simply nodded, and went back to his work. The following Tuesday, he arrived not with a tool or a basket of fruit, but with a long, beautifully crafted planter box made from reclaimed oak. The wood was dark and smooth, the joints seamless. He installed it on the wall outside the kitchen window, in the exact spot where the morning sun would fall. He filled it with rich, dark soil from the compost pile. It was her grandmother’s balcony of dreams, made real and solid, a gift that said everything he rarely spoke.

In December, Chénelle did something she hadn’t done in years: she invited her mother for Sunday lunch. The Señora arrived, wrapped in a formidable coat, her expression skeptical, as if expecting to find her daughter living in a ruin overrun by nature. She walked onto the patio and stopped, her sharp eyes taking in the quiet order of the dormant garden. She peered into the kitchen, where jars of preserved tomatoes—the ‘sunsets in a jar,’ as Chénelle had called them in her act—lined a shelf that Mateo had built. She saw the new window box, the sturdy desk by the fire, the calm, easy way Chénelle moved through her own home. She saw Mateo, who greeted her with a quiet, formal ‘Señora’ and a respect that seemed to instantly neutralize her defenses. They ate at the kitchen table, a hearty stew made with the last of the garden’s vegetables. Her mother ate with a focused intensity, then pointed her fork at Chénelle. ‘You are different,’ she announced, as if delivering a verdict. ‘Your face is… quieter.’ She gestured toward the pantry shelves. ‘You made this? From that jungle?’ Chénelle nodded, a smile playing on her lips. Her mother shook her head, a slow, grudging admission. ‘I see,’ she said, as if finally understanding a complex joke. ‘This is not a place you buy vegetables from. It is a place you grow a life.’ The joke had finally found its punchline, and it was warm, and true, and tasted of home.

The day after her mother’s visit, Chénelle wrote the final chapter of her book. It ended not with a triumphant performance or a book deal, but with her and Mateo on the patio steps, shelling beans in the twilight. She described the simple, rhythmic click of the beans in the bowl, the shared blanket, the quiet pressure of his hand on hers. She ended it with the understanding that this, not the applause, was the harvest. She read the whole manuscript one last time, then, without fanfare or fear, she attached it to an email and sent it to Ricardo. Her finger hovered over the send button for only a second. It was an act of faith. She was setting a seed in the wind, and she was content not to know where it would land.

A week later, just before Christmas, a large, flat package arrived. It wasn’t from Ricardo. Chénelle opened it on the kitchen table. Inside were not contracts or marketing plans, but a dozen seed catalogs, their pages filled with impossibly vibrant photographs of flowers and vegetables she had never heard of. There was a small note tucked inside, written in Ricardo’s spiky, impatient hand. ‘For the spring,’ it read. ‘I am told one must plan ahead. Let me know what the trellis budget looks like. R.’ Chénelle laughed, a sound of pure, uncomplicated joy. That evening, she and Mateo sat by the fire, the colourful pages spread across the floor like a map to the future. He pointed to a variety of strange, striped tomato called a ‘Tigerella,’ his finger tracing its picture. ‘This one,’ he said, a smile in his voice, ‘is a troublemaker. It climbs everywhere. It will need a strong trellis.’ He looked up at her, his eyes catching the firelight, echoing the question he had asked her so long ago in a very different garden. ‘What do you think? Do we have room for a troublemaker?’ Chénelle looked at the man before her, at the peaceful, firelit room, at the colourful map of promises spread at their feet. The empty spaces, both inside and out, no longer felt like a void to be feared, but a possibility to be filled. ‘Mateo,’ she said, her voice full of a deep, quiet certainty. ‘I think we have room for anything.’Winter came to the plains not as a gentle blanket of snow but as a sharpening of the world.

The slow thaw of winter was less a single event than a gradual softening of edges. The biting wind lost its ferocity, carrying the scent of damp earth instead of ice. The light, which for months had been a low, slanted thing, began to climb higher in the sky, lingering for a few more minutes each evening. Inside the house, the seed catalogs were dog-eared and smudged with dirt, their glossy promises now translated into neat rows of labels on seed trays that covered almost every sunny windowsill. Chénelle and Mateo had spent the long evenings of January and February debating the merits of different beans, the virtues of a particular squash, the precise placement of the troublemaking ‘Tigerella’ tomatoes. It was a language of pure potential, a conversation about a future they were designing from the ground up, one seed at a time. The silence from the world of publishing was a different kind of winter, a fallow period where a seed had been sown into the dark, and all one could do was wait and trust the process.

The call from Ricardo came on one of the first truly warm afternoons, a day when Chénelle had her sleeves rolled up, her hands deep in a wheelbarrow of compost she was mixing with Mateo. She answered on speakerphone, her hands too dirty to hold the device to her ear. Ricardo’s voice, filtered through the tiny speaker, was a study in forced restraint. ‘Chénelle. Are you sitting? Meditating? Communing with a turnip? Whatever it is, stop. I have news.’ There was a pause, a theatrical intake of breath. ‘A publisher. Not just any publisher. One of the old, serious ones. The editor, a woman named Silvia Roca, she read the entire manuscript in one night. She…’ Ricardo’s voice cracked with a sliver of genuine awe. ‘She said it was the truest thing she had read in a decade. They want a meeting. In Madrid. Tomorrow.’

Chénelle looked at Mateo, whose face remained impassive, his hands still resting in the dark, fragrant soil. A meeting. Madrid. The words felt like they belonged to a different life, a different Chénelle. The old her would have been a frantic mess of anxiety and ambition. The new her felt a stillness, a deep, quiet curiosity. She had a sudden, clear vision of herself walking into a sterile office building, the scent of compost clinging to her clothes. The image didn't scare her; it grounded her. ‘Okay, Ricardo,’ she said, her voice calm. ‘Tomorrow.’ Later that evening, as they cleaned up, she asked Mateo, ‘Will you come with me?’ It wasn’t a plea for support, but an invitation. ‘I don’t want to go back to that world alone.’ He looked at her, then nodded slowly. ‘I will wait for you,’ he said. ‘Outside the walls.’

The publishing house occupied a sleek glass building in a corporate part of Madrid that seemed designed to repel nature. The lobby was a symphony of grey marble and brushed steel, the air chilled and smelling faintly of industrial cleaning products. Mateo, in his clean but well-worn work clothes, looked like a figure from a realist painting who had wandered into a minimalist photograph. He squeezed her hand before she went through the security turnstiles. ‘The soil here is poor,’ he murmured, a small smile playing on his lips. ‘Do not be afraid to bring your own.’ He settled onto a stone bench outside, pulling a small, battered book from his pocket, a self-contained island of peace amidst the city’s hurry. Chénelle walked into the elevator, carrying the scent of her garden and the warmth of his hand with her.

The editor, Silvia Roca, was not what Chénelle had expected. She was a woman in her fifties with sharp, intelligent eyes, a severe haircut, and an aura of profound weariness, as if she had been fighting a long, losing battle against bad prose. Her office was surprisingly cluttered, with precarious stacks of manuscripts threatening to avalanche onto the floor. She did not offer platitudes. She motioned for Chénelle to sit, fixed her with an intense gaze, and said, ‘Your book is about gardening the way *Moby Dick* is about fishing. I hate gardening. I loved your book.’ The directness was disarming. ‘Most memoirs I read are exercises in brand management. Yours is an exercise in paying attention. I want to publish it exactly as it is.’ Chénelle felt a wave of relief so profound it almost made her dizzy. ‘But,’ Silvia continued, leaning forward, ‘the world will try to turn you back into a brand. Our marketing department will want to put a picture of you laughing with a trowel on the cover. They will want to call it *Eat, Pray, Plant*. My job is to protect the book from them. Your job is to help me.’

The drive home was quiet, the city receding behind them. Chénelle relayed the conversation, the surprising alliance she had forged with the weary editor. Mateo listened, his eyes on the road. ‘She is a gardener, too,’ he said when she finished. ‘Her soil is just made of paper.’ When they got home, the late afternoon sun was slanting across the yard. Without discussion, they went to the spot they had designated for the tomatoes. They had the posts, reclaimed from an old fence, and the wire. The work of building the trellis was hard and physical. Mateo showed her how to dig the post holes deep, how to mix the concrete to give them an unshakeable foundation. ‘A trellis for a troublemaker needs deep roots,’ he said, echoing their earlier conversations. As they worked, stretching the wires between the posts, Chénelle felt the abstract anxieties of the publishing world solidify into a simple, manageable task. This was the structure. This was the trellis. It had to be built with care, with strength, with integrity. It was the only way it would be strong enough to hold the wild, beautiful, and troublesome life that was coming.The slow thaw of winter was less a single event than a gradual softening of edges.

Spring arrived in earnest, no longer a tentative suggestion but a full-throated declaration. The air grew thick with the scent of blossoming things and the energetic hum of insects. On the windowsills, the seed trays became a crowded nursery, a miniature jungle of green shoots pushing eagerly toward the light. The time had come for the most delicate and hopeful of all gardening tasks: transplanting. It was, Chénelle thought as she gently eased a young pepper plant from its cell, an act of radical faith. She was taking these small, vulnerable lives from their protected home and planting them in the wide, unpredictable world of the garden, trusting that the soil was rich enough, the sun kind enough, and their roots strong enough to take hold. Each seedling she settled into the dark earth felt like a small, tangible prayer.

This act of faith in the garden was mirrored by the strange, new work of publishing. Silvia Roca, her paper-gardener ally, proved true to her word. A conference call was arranged with the marketing team, a disembodied group of enthusiastic young voices who spoke in a rapid-fire dialect of analytics, demographics, and platform synergy. Chénelle took the call on a portable speaker, seated on an overturned bucket in the middle of the garden, a trowel in her hand. Mateo worked nearby, methodically weeding a bed of onions, a silent, grounding presence. The contrast was a comedy set she might have once written, but now it was simply her life. A young man named Borja pitched the title *Eat, Pray, Plant* with the breathless conviction of a prophet. ‘It connects with the established wellness and self-discovery market, Chénelle! It’s aspirational, it’s searchable, it’s a brand!’

Chénelle looked at the fragile pepper plant in her hand, its roots a delicate, tangled web. ‘Borja,’ she said, her voice calm and clear over the speaker, ‘a plant doesn’t aspire. It grows or it dies. My book isn’t about finding yourself. It’s about losing yourself in the work. The title is *Cruel to the Old Wood*. It’s honest. It has thorns.’ There was a baffled silence from the marketing team. Ricardo, also on the line, cleared his throat nervously. But then Silvia’s dry, authoritative voice cut in. ‘The title is not negotiable. It’s the central metaphor. If you can’t market a metaphor, you’re in the wrong business. Next.’ The small battle was won, and Chénelle felt a quiet surge of gratitude for her sharp-edged, weary editor. She placed the pepper plant into the hole she had dug and firmed the soil around its stem, an act that felt like a confirmation of the call.

The next front in the war against branding was the cover. An email arrived with a series of mock-ups. They were exactly as Silvia had predicted. There was Chénelle, in soft focus, wearing immaculate white linen, laughing as she held up a single, perfect, dirt-free carrot. There was another of her sitting in a pristine field of wildflowers, her hair artfully tousled, staring thoughtfully at the sky. It was a complete betrayal of the dirt, the sweat, the soap solution, and the back-breaking work of building the trellis. It was a picture of the woman she might have been if Mateo had never walked through her gate. She rejected them all with a simple, two-sentence email. ‘This is not my story. I was not laughing.’

Her counter-proposal was radical in its simplicity. She took a photograph herself, with her phone. It was not of her, but of Mateo’s hands. Just his hands, resting on the worn wooden handle of his oldest trowel, the one with the blade sharpened to a gleam. His hands were not clean. They were creased with lines of work, the fingernails permanently underlined with soil, the knuckles calloused and strong. They were the hands that had pruned, planted, and built. They were the hands that had taught her everything. They were the honest, unadorned heart of the book. She sent the photo to Silvia with the caption: ‘This is the story.’ To her astonishment, and to Ricardo’s apoplectic horror, Silvia agreed. The quiet, powerful truth of the image was undeniable. It was a cover that did not shout, but invited the reader to listen.

As the last of the seedlings were settled into their new homes in the garden, a palpable sense of accomplishment filled the air. The beds were neat, the soil was dark and rich, and the tiny plants stood in hopeful, vulnerable rows. The trellis, its concrete feet now fully cured and solid, stood ready for the troublemaking tomatoes. That evening, Chénelle and Mateo performed the final, ceremonial planting. They worked together, digging the holes for the ‘Tigerella’ seedlings at the base of the sturdy structure. As she settled the last plant into the earth, Chénelle felt a flicker of the old fear. It was all so real now. The plants were in the ground. The book had a cover. The quiet, private world she had built was about to be sent out into the world, to be judged, to be consumed. The thought was a cold knot in her stomach.

She must have looked as stricken as she felt, because Mateo paused, his hands covered in soil, and looked at her, his gaze steady. He didn’t ask what was wrong. He seemed to understand that this final act of commitment was the most frightening of all. He reached out, not to touch her, but to gently touch the wire of the trellis they had built. It vibrated with a low, resonant hum. ‘The structure is strong, Chénelle,’ he said, his voice a quiet rumble. ‘It will hold. Now, you just have to trust the plant to do its part.’ He then took a piece of soft twine and, with an almost reverent tenderness, tied the main stem of the young tomato plant to the lowest wire. It was not a restriction, but a guidance, an offer of support. The simple gesture unknotted the fear in her chest. She had done the work. She had built her trellis. She could not control the pests, or the weather, or the critics, but she had created a structure of integrity. The rest was an act of faith.## Chapter 8

Summer settled over the plains like a warm, heavy blanket, turning the greens of the garden deep and lush. The ‘Tigerella’ tomatoes, true to their troublemaking nature, had mounted a full-scale assault on the trellis, their vigorous vines twisting up the posts and along the wires, heavy with clusters of green, striped fruit just beginning to blush with colour. The air was a complex perfume of lavender, the sharp scent of tomato leaves under the sun, and the low, sweet hum of the bees that now treated the garden as their personal territory. Chénelle’s life had found the rhythm of the season. Mornings were for writing, her words flowing with the steady confidence of a well-tended river. Afternoons were for the garden, a physical dialogue of weeding, watering, and watching, her hands now as familiar with the soil as Mateo’s. Their partnership had deepened into a quiet, seamless union, their movements around the house and garden a long-practiced dance, their conversations a comfortable tapestry woven from long silences and short, meaningful exchanges.

The box arrived on a sweltering afternoon in late July. It was a simple, stark white cardboard box from the publisher, its formal presence an alien object on the rustic kitchen table. Chénelle stared at it for a long time, her heart beating a slow, heavy rhythm. It was one thing to see a digital mock-up; it was another to be faced with the physical fact of the thing she had made. Mateo came in from outside, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his arm, and saw the box, and the look on her face. He said nothing, just leaned against the doorframe, his presence a silent, solid support. With a deep breath, Chénelle sliced the tape and opened it. Inside, nestled in tissue paper, were ten copies of *Cruel to the Old Wood*. She lifted one out. It had a surprising weight, a satisfying density. The cover was matte, the paper thick and creamy. And there they were: his hands. The photograph was perfect, stark and honest, the creases and calluses rendered with an almost sacred clarity. It was not a self-help book. It was an artifact of labour.

She ran her thumb over the image, a strange sense of dislocation washing over her. It was her name on the cover, but his hands. It was her story, but his wisdom had been the water and the sun. She felt a surge of emotion so complex it had no name—gratitude, love, a profound sense of shared creation. She turned and held the book out to him. He dried his hands carefully on a cloth before taking it, holding it with a gentle reverence, as if it were a fragile seedling. He stared at the cover for a long time, his expression unreadable. He traced the lines of his own photographed hands with his real thumb, a quiet, tactile act of recognition. He did not say ‘Congratulations’ or ‘It’s beautiful.’ He looked from the cover to her, his dark honey eyes holding a universe of unspoken understanding. ‘They are good hands,’ he said, his voice a low rumble. ‘They have done good work.’ He handed the book back to her, the simple statement a more profound validation than any bestseller list could ever be.

The book was released into the world not with a bang, but with a slow, quiet ripple. Ricardo, true to his word, had adopted a strategy of patient cultivation. There was no splashy launch party, no frantic media tour. Instead, small excerpts began to appear in literary journals and nature magazines. The first reviews were not in the major newspapers, but in smaller, respected publications, written by critics who were also gardeners, or carpenters, or people who simply understood the value of quiet, honest work. They didn't praise the book’s marketability; they praised its integrity. Then, the letters began to arrive, forwarded by Ricardo in bewildered batches. They were from people all over the country. A librarian in a rainy northern city who had started a pot of basil on her windowsill. An old man in Andalusia who had finally cleared the overgrown bougainvillea that had been swallowing his late wife’s garden. A young woman in Barcelona who had quit her high-stress marketing job to apprentice with a cabinet maker. They were not fan letters. They were letters of recognition, notes from fellow gardeners tending their own small patches of earth.

The true test of their new structure came in the form of a phone call from Ricardo, his voice a frantic mixture of horror and elation. ‘Chénelle! It’s the beast! The big one! The most-watched morning show in Spain wants to do a segment. Not just an interview, a live remote. “A Morning in the Garden with Chénelle.” They want to bring the cameras, the hosts, the whole circus. They want to film you picking a tomato and talking about authenticity. It’s the jackpot. It’s everything I ever wanted for you, and it’s the worst possible thing that could happen.’ He was a man watching his two deepest desires, fame and integrity, collide head-on. The idea was grotesque. A camera crew trampling the thyme, sound booms dangling over the lavender, a perky host asking her to perform a simplified, palatable version of her own life for a national audience. It was an invasive species of the most aggressive kind.

That evening, she and Mateo sat on the patio as the sun bled into the horizon, the cicadas beginning their nightly chorus. She laid the offer before him, not as a problem to be solved, but as a weed to be identified. He listened, his gaze on the troublemaking tomatoes, which were now heavy with ripe, red-and-yellow-striped fruit. When she was finished, he didn’t offer an opinion. He asked a simple question. ‘What is the work now?’ The question cut through all the noise of opportunity and exposure. The work was not being a television personality. The work was writing the next book. The work was tending the garden that fed her body and her spirit. The work was this life they had so carefully built. The answer was clear. She called Ricardo the next day. ‘No cameras,’ she said. ‘There will never be cameras in the garden. But you can tell them I will read a chapter. Audio only. They can show still photographs of the plants. The garden is a place of work, not a television set. It is not for sale.’

After the call, a profound sense of peace settled over her. The final, most insidious weed had been pulled. Later that afternoon, she and Mateo stood before the trellis, baskets in hand. It was time for the first real harvest of the Tigerellas. The scent of the sun-warmed fruit was rich and sweet. He showed her how to snap the tomatoes from the vine without bruising them, their skins warm to the touch. They worked in a comfortable, practiced silence, filling their baskets with the strange, beautiful, troublesome fruit. The structure they had built was strong, and it was holding. She picked a particularly ripe tomato, its skin a vibrant explosion of red and orange stripes. She handed it to Mateo. He took a bite, the juice running down his chin, and a slow, beautiful smile spread across his face. He held it out to her. ‘Taste,’ he said. ‘This is the story.’ She took a bite, and the flavour was explosive, complex, and utterly real. It was the taste of the sun, the soil, the work, and the waiting. It was the taste of a punchline that had finally, perfectly, landed.The juice was a revelation, a complex chord of sweetness and acidity that sung of the long, hot days it had absorbed. They stood there for a moment in the golden afternoon light, passing the half-eaten tomato back and forth, a communion more profound than any celebrated with wine. It was a shared moment of victory over the ennui, the weeds, the whiteflies, and the insistent, hungry demands of the outside world. This singular taste was the tangible result of their shared labour, a truth so potent it needed no explanation. Then, with a shared look of understanding, they went back to the work, the spell broken but its magic lingering. Their baskets grew heavy, laden with the bounty of their troublemaking vines. The rhythmic snap of stems and the soft thud of fruit landing in the baskets became a form of applause, a private ovation for a performance no one else had seen.

Ricardo called back an hour later. His voice lacked its usual frantic edge; it was replaced by a weary resignation that bordered on admiration. The television network, predictably, had balked at her refusal. An audio-only reading was not the visual feast they had envisioned. They had threatened to pull the segment entirely, to which Ricardo, in a move that shocked Chénelle to her core, had simply replied, ‘Then pull it. Her readers will find her, and your viewers will miss out.’ He had called their bluff, and they had folded, agreeing to her terms. He had become the trellis, holding firm against the storm. He had chosen the long-term health of the plant over a single, spectacular, but ultimately damaging bloom. ‘They’re showing a photo of the book cover,’ he’d said, ‘and then just… pictures of tomatoes. For three minutes. While you read. It’s either career suicide or avant-garde genius. At this point, with you, I can no longer tell the difference.’

That evening, the kitchen was filled with the rich, bubbling scent of tomato sauce. They didn't open a celebratory bottle of champagne. Instead, they chopped onions and garlic, their movements easy and familiar in the small space. Chénelle tore leaves from a basil plant thriving in the planter box outside the window, its fragrance sharp and green. They cooked a simple meal of pasta with a sauce made from the day's harvest, a dish so vibrant and full of life it made every meal she had ever eaten in an expensive Madrid restaurant seem like a pale imitation. They ate at the sturdy kitchen table, the windows open to the cooling air, the sounds of the night beginning to stir. They didn't talk about the book, or the television show, or the strange, winding path her career had taken. They talked about the sauce, how the sweetness of one tomato balanced the acidity of another, and how next year, they should plant more of the little yellow ones because their flavour was so concentrated.

Later, they sat on the patio steps, the empty plates scraped clean, watching as the first stars pricked the deep indigo of the sky. The garden was a dark, sleeping shape before them, exhaling the last of the day’s warmth. Chénelle leaned her head on Mateo’s shoulder, a comfortable, familiar weight. The journey that had started with a joke without a punchline had led her here, to this profound and simple peace. The desperation she had once mined for comedy had been replaced by a deep-rooted contentment that was, in its own way, far more interesting. She had not arrived in the horticultural uprising she had first feared; she had arrived in a place where she could finally, quietly, grow. The story wasn’t a performance anymore. It was the solid ground beneath her feet, the man by her side, and the sure and certain knowledge that when spring came again, they would be here, with their seed catalogs and their trowels, ready to begin the work all over again.**Epilogue**

One Year Later

Spring returned to the plains outside Madrid, but it was a different spring. It arrived not as a chaotic riot to be subdued, but as a familiar and welcome guest. The garden was no longer a battlefield but a mature and complex kingdom. The lavender had grown into thick, fragrant hedges, humming with the industry of bees. The thyme had crept across the flagstones, creating a soft, scented mortar that released its perfume with every footstep. The trellis, its wood now weathered to a soft silver, stood as a monument to a past battle won, its wires already twined with the hopeful green tendrils of this year’s tomatoes. The entire space breathed with a deep, settled confidence, the way a person does when they are finally, comfortably, at home in their own skin.

Chénelle stood on the patio, a tray of small, earth-stained terracotta cups in her hands. She wore a simple linen dress, her bare feet dusty, her hair tied back in a messy knot. There were laugh lines around her eyes that hadn't been there two years ago, etched not by desperation but by genuine, easy joy. She was hosting a party, if one could call it that. It was more of a gathering, a small confluence of the disparate rivers that now fed her life. Ricardo was there, looking profoundly out of place and yet completely at ease in a pair of expensive loafers that were now coated in a fine layer of yellow dust. He was in a deep and serious conversation with Silvia Roca, the formidable editor, not about sales figures or foreign rights, but about the stubborn persistence of bindweed. Silvia, holding a cup of chilled gazpacho made from last year's preserved tomatoes, was nodding with the grim respect of a fellow soldier.

Her mother, the Señora, was holding court by the planter box Mateo had built, proudly explaining to a bewildered but polite Ricardo how to tell when basil is about to bolt. She had become the self-appointed docent of the garden’s smallest and most visible corner. The change in her was perhaps the most improbable bloom of all. She no longer saw her daughter’s life as an eccentric folly, but as a source of deep, baffling pride—and an endless supply of high-quality vegetables. And at the center of it all, moving with a quiet, gravitational pull, was Mateo. He was manning a small grill he had fashioned from an old oil drum, turning thick slices of aubergine and courgette glistening with olive oil. He moved with the same unhurried economy he always had, the host and heart of this place, his presence as essential and life-giving as the sun.

Later, as the afternoon sun began to soften, they all gathered around the glass table. The book, *Cruel to the Old Wood*, lay in the center, its cover bearing the image of his hands now worn and familiar. It had not been a blockbuster, but it had found its way into the world with a quiet, steady persistence, like a hardy perennial. It had earned back its advance, spawned translations in seven languages, and, most importantly, had never been turned into a brand. It remained a story. Ricardo raised his glass of wine. ‘To the Garden Woman,’ he said, his voice laced with an irony that was now affectionate instead of sharp. ‘May her next harvest be as surprising as her first.’

Chénelle smiled, shaking her head. She picked up a small, leather-bound notebook from the table, its pages filled with her familiar scrawl. ‘I’m working on the next one,’ she said, her voice carrying easily in the warm air. ‘It’s not about beginnings this time. It’s about what comes after. It’s about the art of maintenance.’ She opened the notebook to a marked page. ‘And it starts like this.’ She cleared her throat, not with a performer’s flourish, but with a writer’s quiet focus. ‘We think of love as a bolt of lightning, and of building a life as a frantic act of construction. But the real work begins when the storm has passed and the foundation is laid. It is the patient, daily work of pulling the small weeds before they take root, of checking for pests, of turning the soil. It is the art of noticing, of tending, of showing up, day after day, for the quiet, necessary, and beautiful work of keeping things alive.’

She closed the notebook. A profound silence settled over the small group, the kind she had once feared and now cherished. It was a silence filled not with expectation, but with understanding. Mateo caught her eye from across the table, a slow smile spreading across his face, a look of such deep love and recognition that it made her heart ache with a sweet, quiet joy. The story was still growing. The work was not over. It was simply the beginning of the next, beautiful season.## Chapter 9

The morning the television segment was scheduled to air, a profound and deliberate normality settled over the garden. Chénelle and Mateo were not inside, huddled around a screen. They were on their knees in a newly cleared bed at the far end of the property, a patch they had decided to dedicate to wildflowers, a space of managed chaos. They were planting poppies and cornflowers, their hands moving in the easy, synchronised rhythm of a long-practiced partnership. The task was small and hopeful, the seeds tiny black specks of potential against the dark, rich soil. It was an act of deliberate, grounding ignorance. A television studio in Madrid might be broadcasting her voice, but here, on the plains, the only sounds were the whisper of the wind, the chirping of sparrows, and the soft crumble of earth between their fingers. It was a conscious choice, a reaffirmation of their core principle: the work was what mattered, not the echo it made in the world.

Ricardo’s call came just before noon, as they were washing the dirt from their hands under the outdoor tap. His voice was a marvel of professional disorientation. ‘I don’t know what just happened,’ he said, forgoing any greeting. ‘The switchboard at the network lit up. The server for their website crashed. But people weren’t asking for selfies or autographs. They were asking for the name of the tomato variety. They were asking what kind of soap you use for whiteflies. An agricultural supplier in Murcia is my newest best friend. It was the strangest, quietest, most successful piece of television I have ever been associated with.’ He sounded like a man who had set out to launch a firework and had instead caused a field to bloom.

The letters and emails that followed were of a different character than before. The first wave had been quiet notes of personal recognition. This new wave was more urgent, more questioning, from people who felt they had been given not just a story, but an instruction manual they didn't know how to read. Amidst the deluge, Ricardo forwarded a single email with the subject line: ‘An old piece of wood.’ Chénelle’s stomach gave a familiar, unwelcome lurch. She opened it, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm against her ribs. The name at the bottom was Javier. It was a name she had not spoken or typed in years, a name that belonged to a litany of jokes about men who used her feminism as a pickup line.

The email was not what she expected. It was not angry, nor was it a pathetic plea. It was measured, thoughtful, and unnervingly self-aware. He wrote that a friend had made him listen to the broadcast, and that hearing his own behaviour, anonymised but unmistakable, described in her calm, clear voice had been a deeply surreal experience. He said that he had then bought the book, and had read it in a single sitting. ‘You held up a mirror, Chénelle,’ he wrote, ‘and I was horrified to see that I recognised the man in it. Not just in the jokes, but in the desperation, the need for an audience, the ache of being disconnected. I wanted to tell you that the man you wrote about doesn't exist anymore. Or at least, he is trying very hard not to. I am on my way to a job in Portugal, a quieter life, I hope. I will be passing not far from you in a few days. I know it is a lot to ask, but I would like to see the garden. I need to see the place where a person can learn to grow something real.’

Chénelle read the email three times. A ghost had just knocked on her door, not with a rattling chain, but with a polite, well-written request. This was the acid test of her new peace. The ‘hungry Chénelle’ would have sharpened this into a brutal five-minute routine for the stage. The ‘ivory tower Chénelle’ would have ignored it, deleting the email as an unwelcome intrusion. But the ‘Garden Woman’—what was she supposed to do? The impulse to say no was powerful, a primal urge to protect the sanctuary she had so carefully built. To let him in felt like inviting a blight, a disease from the past, into her healthy, thriving ecosystem. She spent the rest of the afternoon in a state of quiet turmoil, the rhythmic work of the garden failing, for the first time, to soothe the anarchy in her mind.

That evening, she told Mateo. They were on the patio, sharing a simple meal of bread and cheese as the sky deepened to violet. She didn’t show him the email; she recited its essence, her voice carefully neutral. He listened without interruption, his gaze fixed on the tangled silhouette of the wisteria against the dying light. When she finished, he was silent for a long time, chewing a piece of bread with his usual deliberation. She braced herself for a flash of jealousy, for a protective refusal, for him to tell her it was a bad idea. Instead, he asked a simple, devastating question. ‘Is he a weed, Chénelle?’ She was taken aback. ‘A weed? I… I don’t know. He used to be.’ Mateo tore another piece of bread and pointed with it toward a single, tall thistle that had sprung up near the compost pile, which he had, for some reason, allowed to remain. ‘Some weeds, you pull at once. They are poison, they will choke everything. But some… some you watch. You see what they do. The thistle has deep roots. It is difficult to remove. But its flowers feed the bees, and its seeds feed the goldfinches. It is not always simple.’ He looked back at her, his eyes clear and searching. ‘The question is not what he was. The question is, what is your garden now? Is it a fragile place, that a single visitor can destroy? Or is it a strong place, that can bear a thistle for a day?’

His words settled the chaos in her mind. He was right. To refuse Javier’s visit would be an admission that her peace was a fragile, greenhouse-grown thing, unable to withstand a single moment of exposure to the unpredictable weather of her past. It would mean that her new life was a fortress with the drawbridge pulled up, not the open, rooted, and resilient ecosystem she believed she had cultivated. Her strength, like the garden’s, could not be measured by its isolation, but by its ability to integrate, to withstand, to endure a visitor without being overcome. The fear was still there, a cold stone in her stomach, but beneath it was a bedrock of certainty. She had done the work. The ground was strong. She went inside, to the small desk by the fireplace, and opened her laptop. Her reply to Javier was short, her fingers steady on the keys. ‘The garden is open on Thursday,’ she wrote. ‘Come in the afternoon. I’ll leave the gate unlatched.’The two days leading up to Thursday were a quiet exercise in trust. Chénelle did not allow herself to spiral into old anxieties. Instead, she immersed herself in the physical reality of the garden. She deadheaded the roses, her fingers stained with pollen, methodically snipping away the spent blooms to encourage new ones. She harvested zucchini, their skins a deep, glossy green, the weight of them solid and satisfying in her hands. She did not talk about the impending visit with Mateo; there was no need. His presence was a quiet, constant reassurance. He seemed to know, without being told, that what she needed was not discussion but the steady rhythm of their shared work, the silent confirmation that this life they had built was real and durable. The garden was not a stage set for a confrontation; it was a living, breathing entity, and her role, her only role, was to tend to it.

On Thursday afternoon, a small, dusty rental car, utterly devoid of the flashy pretense she associated with Javier, pulled up on the road outside her gate. Chénelle was on the patio, ostensibly reading, but her eyes kept drifting toward the sound of the engine cutting out. She heard the crunch of shoes on the gravel drive, a hesitant, shuffling sound, not the confident stride she remembered. The metallic clatter of the latch being lifted sounded like a gunshot in the quiet afternoon. She stayed where she was, her book open in her lap, her heart a slow, heavy drum against her ribs.

The man who stepped through the gate was a ghost, but a faded one. The sharp, fashionable angles of the Javier she remembered had been softened by a kind of weary resignation. He was thinner, his clothes simpler, his hair unstyled. He looked less like a man on his way to conquer a new city and more like a traveler who had been on the road for a very long time. His eyes, when they finally met hers, were stripped of their usual irony. He didn't look at her with the possessive appraisal she had once mistaken for adoration, but with a kind of nervous reverence, like a pilgrim entering a shrine he wasn’t sure he was worthy of. He did not look at her for long. His gaze was immediately pulled to the garden itself, a slow, sweeping pan that took in the ordered abundance, the deep greens, the splashes of color. ‘It’s just as you described it,’ he said, his voice softer than she remembered. ‘But more… alive.’

‘It’s a lot of work,’ she replied, the simple, honest statement a shield against the need for small talk. She stood, closing her book. ‘Did you want a tour?’ He gave a short, almost grateful nod. The tour was not a performance. It was a recitation of facts. She showed him the bougainvillea, its fury now trained into an elegant cascade of deep pink against the wall. ‘It forgot its manners,’ she said, quoting Mateo. ‘We had to remind it.’ She led him to the compost bins, the rich, dark, earthy-smelling heart of the garden’s resilience. ‘This is where the old stuff becomes the new stuff,’ she explained simply. Javier stared at the steaming pile of decay and life, a profound understanding dawning on his face. He seemed to grasp that this was not just a gardening technique, but the central thesis of her entire world.

She saved the trellis for last. It stood at the back of the garden, a monument of wood and wire, its structure almost completely obscured by the wild, fruitful tangle of the Tigerella vines. The air around it was thick with the sharp, green scent of tomato leaves. Javier reached out and touched one of the thick, weathered posts. ‘The trellis for the troublemakers,’ he murmured, quoting her own words back to her. ‘You really built it.’ ‘*We* built it,’ she corrected him gently. ‘It needed a strong foundation.’ As she said it, she saw Mateo. He was working by the wildflower patch, on his knees, carefully thinning the poppy seedlings to give the stronger ones room to thrive. He had not looked up, had made no sign that he was aware of their presence, granting her the dignity of facing this ghost on her own.

But Javier had seen him too. He watched him for a long moment, this man he only knew as a literary device, a silent, powerful force in the narrative of the woman he had lost. There was no flicker of jealousy in his expression, only a deep, weary curiosity. He turned back to Chénelle. ‘I see,’ he said, and the words were imbued with a final, painful clarity. ‘The book isn’t a comedy, is it? It’s an instruction manual.’ He took a deep breath, the air of the garden seeming to fill a hollow space inside him. ‘Thank you for letting me see it, Chénelle. I… I needed to know a place like this could be real.’ He did not try to hug her, did not attempt any gesture of false intimacy. He simply met her eyes one last time, a look of quiet, unadorned respect, and turned to leave. Chénelle stood by the trellis and watched him walk away. She heard the crunch of his footsteps on the gravel, the soft click of the gate latch, the sound of a car engine starting and then fading into the distance. He was gone. The air did not feel lighter, nor did it feel heavier. It was simply the same air, filled with the same scents. The garden had not noticed his presence, nor did it register his absence. It was too busy with the work of being alive.

She stood there for a long time, her hand resting on the rough bark of a trellis post. She was not reliving the past, nor was she imagining the future. She was simply present, in her garden, on a Thursday afternoon. Mateo finally stood up, brushing the dirt from the knees of his trousers, and walked over to her. He didn’t ask if she was alright. He didn’t ask how it had been. He looked at her face, saw the quiet peace that had settled there, and then gestured with his chin toward the thistle he had let grow by the compost pile. It was tall and proud, its prickly leaves a fierce defense, but at its very top, a single, magnificent, deep purple flower had opened, and a fat bumblebee was tumbling ecstatically in its depths. ‘You see?’ he said, his voice a low, warm rumble. ‘Sometimes, even a thistle has a purpose.’ He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a single, perfectly ripe, heart-shaped strawberry. He held it out to her, a small, red jewel in his soil-stained palm. She took it, its warmth a surprising, living thing against her skin. The visit from her past had not been a blight. It had simply been a reminder of the garden’s profound and unwavering strength. And here, in the quiet of the late afternoon, was the sweet, unexpected taste of the present.**Chapter 10**

Autumn returned, bringing with it a profound sense of completion. The sun, no longer a tyrant, cast a benevolent golden light across the plains, and the air grew crisp, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves. The garden, having given its bounty, was beginning to retreat into itself. The tomato vines, exhausted and yellowing, were pulled from the trellis and added to the ever-maturing compost pile, their cycle complete. The work shifted from the frantic energy of harvest to the slow, meditative tasks of preparation: saving seeds in carefully labeled paper envelopes, mulching the beds with straw, turning the soil one last time before the winter frost would make it unworkable. It was a time of putting things to rest, a gentle drawing of the curtains on the year’s performance. The rhythm of their life slowed in concert, the days defined less by urgent tasks and more by the quiet pleasure of being.

Their partnership had settled into a form of unspoken telepathy. They moved around each other in the kitchen, preparing the last of the season’s peppers for roasting, without the need for words, each anticipating the other’s next move. Chénelle would find a cup of hot coffee waiting for her on her desk in the morning, and Mateo would find his favourite shears, which he had left by the back door, cleaned, oiled, and waiting for him on his workbench. It was a language of small, consistent acts of care, a quiet, daily reinforcement of the trellis they had built around their shared life. The outside world had, for the most part, receded. Ricardo, having embraced his new role as a patient steward, sent only occasional, brief updates. The book continued to find its audience, a quiet stream feeding a growing reservoir, and Silvia Roca remained its fierce, silent guardian. Chénelle felt no pressure to produce; she wrote when the story came, letting it grow at its own pace, trusting the soil she had so carefully prepared.

The letter that shifted the season arrived on a cool October morning. It was not an email forwarded by Ricardo, but a physical envelope made of thick, creamy paper, addressed in an elegant, old-fashioned script. Inside, the letter was not from an individual, but from the ‘Asociación de Vecinos de la Corrala Verde,’ a neighborhood association in Lavapiés. The name itself was a declaration of improbable hope; there was very little that was green in the dense, tangled streets of her old neighborhood. The letter’s author, a woman named Inés, wrote that a group of them, many of whom were older residents who remembered a time when children played in the courtyards, had read Chénelle’s book. They had read it aloud to each other in the evenings. She wrote that the book had woken up a long-dormant dream, the dream of her grandmother’s ‘balcony of dreams,’ but on a larger scale.

They had petitioned the city and been granted stewardship of a derelict interior courtyard, a *corrala* that had been sealed off for decades. It was a square of forgotten land, paved over with cracked asphalt, littered with the ghosts of forgotten things, and surrounded on all sides by the tall, inward-facing walls of their apartment buildings. Their request was simple, audacious, and utterly terrifying. They were not asking for money, or for her to be a celebrity spokesperson. They were asking if she, and the man from the book with the good hands, would be willing to come and look at their soil. They wanted to know if a garden could truly be born from such a place, if it was possible to be cruel to the old asphalt and find something living underneath. They were asking, in essence, if the philosophy of her book was transferable, or if it was just a beautiful story that could only exist in the privileged quiet of the plains.

The letter lay on the kitchen table like a thrown gauntlet. Chénelle felt a cold wave of something akin to stage fright wash over her. Lavapiés. The name alone brought back the sensory claustrophobia of her youth: the smell of frying garlic and diesel fumes, the constant noise, the feeling of being pressed in on all sides by brick and humanity. She had spent years running from that place, and her success had been the vehicle of her escape. To go back, by choice, felt like a betrayal of the peace she had fought so hard to win. It felt like inviting the city, with all its noise and desperation, to trample the quiet sanctuary of her mind. When Mateo came in for lunch, he found her staring at the letter as if it were a venomous snake. She slid it across the table to him without a word. He read it slowly, his brow furrowed in concentration. She expected him to see the threat, to feel the same protective instinct she did. She expected him to say, ‘This is not our work. Our garden is here.’

Instead, he finished the letter, placed it carefully back on the table, and looked out the window toward their own sleeping garden, now resting under its blanket of mulch. ‘It is one thing to tend a garden that wants to grow,’ he said, his voice thoughtful. ‘It is another thing entirely to convince a place that has forgotten how.’ He turned his gaze back to her, and she saw not hesitation, but a flicker of the same diagnostic curiosity she had seen on his face the day he first confronted her bougainvillea. ‘The soil will be poor. Full of bricks and glass and bitterness. It will be the hardest soil we have ever worked.’ He paused, letting the weight of the challenge settle between them. ‘But a garden in a place like that…’ He shook his head, a look of profound respect in his eyes. ‘A garden in a place like that is not a luxury. It is a miracle. It is the most important kind of garden there is.’ Chénelle looked at him, at his unwavering belief in the possibility of growth in even the most hostile environment, and the knot of fear in her stomach began to loosen. She had been thinking of it as a threat to her peace, but he saw it as the ultimate test of their shared philosophy. To refuse would be to admit that her story was, after all, just a fairy tale.His words hung in the air, simple and profound. *The most important kind of garden there is.* In that moment, Chénelle understood. Her beautiful, peaceful garden on the plains was not a destination; it had been a school. It was where she had learned the language of soil and sun, of patience and pruning. To hoard that knowledge, to protect it behind her gate out of fear of the city’s noise, would be the ultimate failure. It would be like saving seeds only to lock them away in a dark drawer forever. The peace she had cultivated was not a fragile treasure to be guarded, but a tool to be wielded, a form of strength to be shared. The fear did not vanish completely, but it transformed into a different kind of energy, the nervous, thrumming excitement of a true and worthy challenge. Her garden had taught her that growth only happens when a plant is tested. Now, it was her turn.

The drive into Madrid was a journey through time, a reversal of her triumphant escape. The wide, open sky of the plains gradually narrowed, compressed by the encroaching buildings. The quiet hum of the countryside was replaced by a rising symphony of sirens, horns, and the collective roar of a million lives lived in close quarters. Chénelle felt the old claustrophobia prickle at the back of her neck, a phantom limb of a past anxiety. She glanced at Mateo, who was driving. He was not tense. His gaze moved over the dense urban landscape with the same calm, diagnostic focus he applied to everything. He seemed to be reading the city’s structure, its points of stress, its surprising pockets of resilience, as if it were a vast, complex, and overgrown organism. He was not intimidated by it; he was simply assessing it. His quiet presence was an anchor, reminding her that she was no longer the desperate comedian fleeing this place, but a different woman entirely, returning with a new set of tools.

Lavapiés was exactly as she remembered it, and yet utterly different, seen through her new eyes. The streets were a chaotic, vibrant tangle, the air thick with the smells of a hundred different kitchens, the sounds a constant, overlapping chatter. They found the *corrala* tucked away down a narrow side street, its entrance an unassuming, paint-chipped door. Inés, the woman who had written the letter, was waiting for them. She was a small, bird-like woman with hair the color of steel wool and eyes like bright, dark seeds, full of a fierce, intelligent hope. She led them through a dark passageway and into the courtyard, and Chénelle’s breath caught in her throat. It was worse than she had imagined. It was a perfect square of despair, walled in by the stained, crumbling backs of five-story buildings. The ground was a sea of cracked, buckled asphalt, littered with debris and shimmering with broken glass. It was a well of shadow, the sky a distant, indifferent square of blue far above. The only sign of life was a single, grotesquely vigorous ailanthus tree—the "tree of heaven," a notoriously invasive species—that had punched its way through the asphalt in one corner, a monument to nature’s most thuggish instincts.

A small group of neighbors had gathered, their faces a mixture of apprehension and desperate expectation. They were old men in worn cardigans, young mothers with children clinging to their legs, a handful of students from the nearby university. They looked at Mateo, this tall, silent man with soil under his fingernails, with a kind of hushed reverence, as if he were a shaman who could read omens in the broken pavement. The irony was so thick Chénelle could have tasted it. She had once mocked this very idea, and now she stood as a silent witness to it, her own story having created the myth. The neighbors began to talk all at once, a chorus of problems: the lack of sun, the bad drainage, the impossibility of it all. Inés tried to quiet them, her hands fluttering with nervous energy.

Mateo, in his characteristic way, ignored the chorus of voices. He handed his canvas bag to Chénelle and began to walk the perimeter of the courtyard, his boots crunching on the glass. He moved with a slow, deliberate purpose, his eyes not on the overwhelming mess, but on the details. He knelt and laid his palm flat against the asphalt in different spots, feeling for variations in temperature. He squinted up at the tall buildings, tracing the arc the sun must take across the small patch of sky, mapping the moving islands of light and shadow throughout the day. He walked over to the ailanthus tree, running his hand over its rough bark, studying the cracks it had forced in the pavement around its base. He crumbled a piece of the dry, dusty soil from the edge of a crack between his fingers. He was not seeing a derelict courtyard; he was reading a patient, detailed history of neglect, and searching for a single word of hope.

Finally, he came back to the center, to the anxious, silent group. He looked at Inés, his gaze direct and serious. ‘The soil that is here,’ he began, his low voice cutting through the city noise, ‘is dead. It is full of poison from the asphalt, and bitterness from being forgotten for so long. It cannot grow anything.’ A wave of disappointment rippled through the group. Inés’s shoulders slumped. ‘To make a garden here,’ he continued, his voice steady, ‘you must first break the ground. All of it. With pickaxes and pry bars. You must haul the broken asphalt and the rubble out, bucket by bucket. Then you must bring new life in. Truckloads of compost, of manure, of good soil. It will be the hardest work you have ever done. It will take a year of feeding the soil before it can even think of feeding you.’ The monumental scale of the task hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. It sounded impossible.

But then Mateo walked over to the south-facing wall, the one he had identified as receiving the most direct sun, albeit for only a few hours a day. He placed his hand on the warm, grimy brick. ‘But you do not start with the whole garden,’ he said, turning back to face them. ‘You start here. With one piece. You break the ground in a single, long strip against this wall. You build one, long, raised bed. And in that bed, you plant the strongest, most stubborn climbing beans you can find. You build a trellis of wire right on this wall, and you teach them to climb toward the sun. You start with a single, green line of hope.’ He had given them not a dream, but a task. A first step. It was manageable, it was concrete, and it was brilliant.

In that moment, Chénelle found her voice. The neighbors looked overwhelmed, caught between the crushing reality of the work and the fragile hope of that single green line. She stepped forward, standing beside Mateo, feeling like a translator between two worlds. ‘He’s right,’ she said, her voice clear and carrying, the old comedian’s projection now put to a new use. ‘When I started my garden, it was a jungle. I wanted to burn it all down. But he didn't do that. We started in one corner. We cleared one path. We pulled one root at a time.’ She looked around at the faces, seeing her own past desperation reflected in them. ‘The work is the point. Every bucket of broken asphalt you carry out is a victory. Every bag of compost you bring in is an act of faith. You won’t be building a garden at first. You will be building the *story* of a garden. And that’s where the magic is.’ She saw a flicker of understanding in their eyes. She had given them a narrative to hold onto, a way to frame the back-breaking labor as a heroic act. She was not the star of the show anymore. She was simply the person who had been lucky enough to hear the story first, and whose new job was to help others learn to tell it for themselves.

They left as the sun began to dip below the rooftops, plunging the courtyard into a deep, purple shadow. The drive back to the plains was different. Chénelle did not feel like she was fleeing the city’s oppressive grasp. She felt like a worker leaving a job site, tired but filled with a sense of purpose. Her hands felt strangely clean, her muscles restless, aching for the satisfying heft of a pickaxe. She looked over at Mateo, his strong profile silhouetted against the setting sun. He had given them a plan. She had given them a story. And together, in the heart of the city she had run from, they had planted a seed in the most difficult soil imaginable. Her garden on the plains was no longer her sanctuary; it was her home base, the place from which this new, more important work could begin. The harvest, she realized, was not the fruit or the flowers or the book. The harvest was the knowledge itself, and it was meant to be scattered.
