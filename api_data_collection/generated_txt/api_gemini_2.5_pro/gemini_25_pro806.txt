The first mistake was the egg boxes. They were supposed to absorb the sound, according to some forum thread Lucia had found from 2007, but all they did was make the spare room smell faintly of chicken and futility. The second, more grievous error, was believing that a Grade II listed terrace house in Old Portsmouth, a building that had stoically withstood Napoleonic-era paranoia and the Luftwaffe, could handle a four-four beat from a novice with more enthusiasm than rhythm.

Sharon’s foot, clad in a steel-toed work boot because she’d just got in from a burst pipe in a Southsea guesthouse, slammed down on the kick drum pedal. The resulting THUMP was less a musical note and more a seismic event. It rattled the sash window in its frame and sent a puff of ancient dust down from the ceiling rose. The cymbal crash that followed was a shriek, a metallic cat-fight that sliced through the damp sea air and straight into the adjoining wall. She was trying to nail the basic beat from ‘Come Together’. Simple, plodding, iconic. Ringo made it sound like a panther stalking through velvet undergrowth. Sharon made it sound like a wardrobe falling down a flight of stairs.

THUMP. Hiss. THWACK. Hiss.

The thwack was the snare, a sharp, satisfying crack that she felt right in her teeth. It was the best part. It was the sound of a problem being decisively solved. Not like the slow, grudging turn of a rusted stopcock or the infuriatingly persistent drip-drip-drip of a failed washer. This was immediate. Assertive. A full stop in a world of commas and question marks.

THUMP. Hiss. THWACK—

A new rhythm joined in. A frantic, rhythmic banging from next door. Mr Henderson, a retired naval cartographer who spent his days cultivating prize-winning fuchsias and writing furious letters to the local council. His broom handle on the party wall had a tempo all of its own. It was a panicked, allegro beat that completely threw her off.

She stopped, letting the sticks rest on the snare. The silence that rushed in was deafening, filled only by her own ragged breathing and the distant cry of a herring gull. Then, from downstairs, another sound.

“Sharon! Are you quite finished with that… that cacophony?”

Her mother’s voice. Val’s voice had a unique timbre, honed by years of trying to be heard over windy piers and the chatter of the Cosham social club. It was a voice that could curdle milk at twenty paces.

Sharon sighed, peeling her sweat-damp t-shirt away from her back. She navigated the cramped room, stepping over a stack of old National Geographics and a toolbox she still hadn't taken back to the van. The drum kit, a battered-looking Pearl model Lucia had found on Gumtree for a steal, took up most of the space. It gleamed under the single bare bulb, a beautiful, monstrous thing. It was a promise and a threat all rolled into one.

Downstairs, the house smelled of Pledge and brewing tea. Val was standing by the kettle, her back ramrod straight, her floral pinny tied in a perfect bow. She didn't turn around. That was always a bad sign.

“Mr Henderson’s been on the phone,” Val said, her voice tight. “Said his commemorative plate of the HMS Victory fell off the mantelpiece. In smithereens, apparently.”

“It was probably blu-tacked on, Mam. He can’t blame gravity on me.” Sharon slumped into a chair at the small formica table. Her hands, usually calloused from wrestling with copper pipes, were starting to blister in new and interesting places from the wooden sticks.

“It’s not right, Sharon. A girl your age.” Val finally turned, placing a cup of tea in front of her. The cup was the good china, the one with the little violets on it. A peace offering and a reprimand in one. “All that banging. It’s… aggressive. It’s not you.”

“How do you know it’s not me?” Sharon retorted, wrapping her sore hands around the warmth of the cup. “Maybe this is the real me. Maybe the real me likes being aggressive.”

“The real you fixes toilets, love. And you’re very good at it. Mrs Higgins from Albert Road said you were a godsend last week. Said you were ever so neat with the sealant.”

That was it. That was her life. A neatly-applied bead of silicone around the base of a porcelain throne was the pinnacle of her achievement. The thought was so bleak it was almost funny. She took a gulp of tea, scalding her tongue. The beat, the simple, hypnotic THUMP-Hiss-THWACK, was still pulsing in her head. It was a heartbeat stronger than her own. It felt more real than Mrs Higgins and her perfectly sealed loo.

“I’m thirty-four, Mam. I’m allowed a hobby.”

“Knitting is a hobby. A book club is a hobby,” Val sniffed, sitting opposite her with her own tea. “What you’re doing up there is giving the entire street a migraine. You’ll be getting an ASBO before you know it.”

The conversation was going nowhere, as it always did. It was a circular trap, like a pipe flowing back on itself. She loved her mum, she really did, but they were tuned to different frequencies. Val’s world was safe, beige, and quiet. Sharon was starting to crave noise. She was sick of the quiet hum of a well-behaved boiler; she wanted the roar of a Marshall stack. Her phone buzzed on the table, a welcome interruption. The screen lit up with a name: Lucia.

A grin spread across Sharon’s face, unbidden. She thumbed the screen to answer.

“Henderson’s commemorative plate has bitten the dust,” she said, without preamble.

Lucia’s laugh crackled down the line, a rich, conspiratorial sound. “Excellent! Collateral damage in the name of art. Did it make a satisfying smashing sound?”

“Couldn’t hear it over the paradiddles, mate.”

“That’s the spirit. Don’t you dare let them get you down, Shaz. The establishment has always been afraid of the beat. You’re a revolutionary. You’re the Che Guevara of the back-beat, the Boudicca of the bass drum.”

Sharon couldn’t help but laugh, the tension in her shoulders easing. Lucia had a way of reframing things, of turning a neighbourhood dispute into an act of heroic rebellion. She made it sound so grand, so important. Lucia was the one who had pushed her into this, after finding her tapping out complex rhythms on a customer's radiator with a pair of wrenches. "You've got the bug," she'd said, her eyes gleaming. "You're a drummer, Shaz. You just don't have the kit yet." Two days later, she’d sent the Gumtree link.

“Mam thinks I should take up knitting,” Sharon said, lowering her voice and watching Val pretend not to listen.

“Never,” Lucia’s voice was firm. “Wool is the opiate of the masses. Listen, I have an idea. A solution to the Henderson problem. Are you free tomorrow night?”

“Got a combi-boiler service in the morning, but yeah, I’m free after that.”

“Perfect. I’ll pick you up at seven. Wear something that says ‘I am a serious musician and not just a public nuisance’.”

“So not my work overalls, then?”

“Precisely. See you tomorrow, rock star.”

The line went dead. Sharon stared at the phone, a slow smile spreading across her face. Lucia didn't just offer support; she offered solutions. She didn't just placate; she plotted. While her mum saw a problem, a noisy, embarrassing mess, Lucia saw a project. A star waiting to be born. Sharon looked at her hands again. The plumber's callouses and the drummer's blisters. Maybe, just maybe, they could exist on the same pair of hands after all. She felt a surge of defiance. She finished her tea, stood up, and looked at her mum.

“I’m going back up,” she said, her voice even.

Val’s face fell. “Oh, Sharon. For heaven’s sake. Give the man a chance to sweep up his dead admiral.”

“I’ll use the practice pads,” she conceded. “They’re quieter.”

It was a lie. She had no intention of using the quiet, unsatisfying rubber pads. But it was enough to make her escape. As she climbed the stairs, the creak of the old wood beneath her feet sounded like the opening notes of a song. The beat was waiting for her. And tomorrow, Lucia was coming, and Lucia always made things better.Back in the spare room, the smell of chicken and futility had been joined by a chalky scent from the disturbed ceiling rose. The drum kit sat in the gloom like a sleeping metal beast. The practice pads Lucia had insisted on buying her were stacked neatly by the hi-hat stand, a circle of mute black rubber. Sharon picked one up. It was dense and lifeless, offering no resonance, no joy. Hitting it was like punching a pillow; the energy went in and simply died. It was the sensible, considerate option. It was Val’s option. She placed it back on the stack with a quiet click. Sensible and considerate were what she did from nine to five. This space, this time, was for something else.

She settled onto the worn stool, the cheap vinyl cracking faintly. She picked up the sticks, feeling their familiar weight settle into the groove of her fingers. The blisters smarted, but it was a good pain. It was the pain of creation, not the dull ache of kneeling on a cold bathroom floor. She took a deep breath, trying to recall Lucia’s advice from a YouTube tutorial they’d watched together. “It’s about control, Shaz. You don’t have to hit it hard, you just have to hit it right. Think of it like coaxing it, not attacking it.”

Ignoring the thumping rhythm of ‘Come Together’, she decided to try something else. She let her foot rest on the kick drum pedal, applying just enough pressure to create a soft, muffled *thud*. It was the sound of a heartbeat, deep and low in the house’s old bones. A sound you felt more than you heard. Then, a gentle tap on the closed hi-hat. Not a crash, but a crisp *tssk*, like a secret being whispered. She added the snare, her left hand coming down with a light, controlled snap. *Thud. Tssk. Tak. Tssk.*

The tempo was slow, hesitant at first. Her limbs felt like four separate, uncooperative employees. The kick was early, the snare was late. It was a mess. But she persisted, her mind narrowing until the only things that existed were the four sounds and the space between them. The world outside the room—the disapproving mother, the furious cartographer, the leaking taps of Southsea—all of it faded into a distant hum. It was just her and the beat. Slowly, painstakingly, something began to shift. Her foot found the pulse. Her hands, so used to the brute force of a wrench, learned a new kind of language.

*Thud. Tssk. Tak. Tssk.*

The rhythm locked in. It wasn’t a wardrobe falling downstairs anymore. It was… something. A steady, purposeful pulse. She felt it in her sternum, a resonant thrum that seemed to align everything inside her. This was the opposite of fixing a burst pipe. That was about stopping a flow, containing chaos, bringing things back to a quiet, orderly stasis. This was about starting a flow. It was about creating a pulse where there was none. It was messy and alive, and it was hers. She wasn’t solving a problem; she was making a statement.

She played for what could have been ten minutes or an hour. Time became elastic, stretching and snapping with the beat. When she finally stopped, the silence that followed was different. It wasn’t empty anymore. It was filled with the ghost of the rhythm, the echo of a purpose she was only just beginning to understand. Her muscles ached with a new, unfamiliar exhaustion, but her mind was clear. The anger and frustration that had coiled in her gut earlier had unspooled. She felt calm, grounded.

She looked at her phone, at the message from Lucia. "Wear something that says ‘I am a serious musician’." What did that even look like? All her clothes said ‘Beware of sudden floods’ or ‘Currently off-duty’. The thought of Lucia’s plan sent a fizz of excitement through her. Lucia didn't do half-measures. Her solutions were always bold, theatrical, and usually involved a level of confidence Sharon could only dream of borrowing. Whatever it was, it wouldn't be knitting. A wide, genuine smile spread across her face. Mr Henderson's plate was gone, her mum was despairing, and the house was probably structurally unsound. But for the first time in a long time, Sharon felt like she was exactly where she was supposed to be.The combi-boiler in a flat overlooking Canoe Lake was misbehaving, its pressure dropping with a petulant sigh every twenty minutes. As she lay on the kitchen lino, her cheek pressed against the cool tiles, methodically checking seals and tracing pipework, Sharon’s fingers were tapping out a silent rhythm against the copper inlet pipe. *Thud-tssk-tak-tssk*. The ghost beat from the night before was still with her, a private metronome ticking away beneath the surface of her day. The homeowner, a nervous man in a towelling robe, hovered nearby, offering anxious updates on the boiler's temperament as if describing a sick relative. Sharon just nodded, her mind half on the pressure gauge and half on how to translate the gurgle of a trapped airlock into a fill on the tom-toms. The job, which would usually have her complete focus, now felt like an interruption, a flat, predictable melody in a world where she was just starting to hear harmonies.

That evening, after a tense but silent dinner with Val, she faced the wardrobe. Lucia’s instruction echoed in her head: 'I am a serious musician'. The contents of her closet stared back, offering only variations on a theme of durable practicality. There were fleece-lined work trousers, checked shirts worn soft with washing, and a collection of T-shirts from plumbing suppliers, emblazoned with logos for stopcocks and pipe-wrenches. The ‘going out’ section was even more depressing: a sensible navy dress for the rare family wedding and a pair of black trousers that had lost their shape years ago. Nothing screamed ‘Boudicca of the bass drum’. It was all stubbornly whispering ‘very reasonable rates’. Frustrated, she pulled out an old black t-shirt, one she’d bought at a gig years ago. It was faded, the band's name barely legible, but it was the closest she had. She paired it with her least-battered pair of jeans and her steel-toed boots. Looking in the mirror, she didn’t see a rock star. She just saw a plumber in a band t-shirt. It would have to do.

At precisely seven o'clock, a car horn blared outside, playing the first five notes of 'Smoke on the Water'. It was a sound so out of place in the quiet street that it felt like a declaration of war. Val, who was watching the local news, tutted so violently it sounded like a small engine failing to start. Sharon grabbed her jacket, feeling a thrill of pure rebellion. Lucia was waiting in a vintage Triumph Spitfire, a ridiculously impractical car painted a shade of electric blue that seemed to vibrate in the twilight. She was perched behind the wheel, wearing oversized sunglasses despite the gathering gloom, and a leopard-print scarf was tied artfully around her neck. Her very presence seemed to suck all the beige out of the immediate vicinity.

“Get in, revolutionary,” Lucia grinned, leaning over to shove a mountain of maps and notebooks off the passenger seat. “The people are waiting.”
Sharon folded herself into the tiny car, the smell of old leather and Lucia’s expensive perfume filling her senses. The engine roared to life, a guttural sound that made the Spitfire shudder.
“So, what’s the big plan?” Sharon shouted over the noise as they screeched away from the curb, leaving a very still, very disapproving Val silhouetted in the doorway. “Are we going to soundproof the room with something that actually works? Industrial-grade foam? A second wall?”
Lucia laughed, a throaty chuckle that was lost in the wind. “My dear Sharon, you’re thinking like a plumber. You see a problem, you want to contain it. I’m thinking like an artist. You see a problem, you make it part of the show.” She took a sharp left, throwing Sharon against the door. “We’re not containing the noise. We’re giving it a bigger stage.”
Sharon’s stomach did a nervous flip. “What does that mean?”
Lucia shot her a sidelong glance, her sunglasses failing to hide the manic gleam in her eyes. “It means, my friend, that you can’t get noise complaints if you’re playing somewhere everyone is already making noise. We’re going to an open mic night.”

The words hit Sharon with the force of a physical blow. An open mic night. The phrase conjured images of earnest young men with acoustic guitars singing about their feelings, of hushed, reverent audiences, and of crippling, soul-destroying judgment. Her, with her clumsy, embryonic drumming, in front of actual people? The very idea was so horrifying it was absurd.
"No. Absolutely not," she managed, her voice barely a squeak. "Lucia, I can't. I've been playing for a week. I only know one and a half beats. I sound like a skip being delivered."
"Nonsense," Lucia declared, expertly weaving through the Portsmouth traffic. "You have rhythm. You have passion. All you lack is confidence, and tonight, you're getting a crash course." She gestured ahead. "And besides, we're here."
The Spitfire pulled up outside a pub Sharon knew by reputation only. The sign above the door, 'The Anvil & Hammer', was flanked by posters advertising live music and real ale. The low, thudding pulse of a bass guitar was already bleeding out onto the pavement, a siren's call to some, but to Sharon, it sounded like her own execution. This wasn’t a solution. This was a nightmare. This was Lucia’s masterpiece of a mistake, and Sharon was the terrified, unwilling star.The Anvil & Hammer hit Sharon not as a place, but as a physical force. She pushed through the heavy door behind Lucia and was met with a solid wall of noise, heat, and the thick, sweet smell of spilled ale and hot vacuum tubes. It was a proper pub, dark and dense, the air so thick with chatter and music you could practically lean on it. A lone guitarist sat on a small, brightly-lit stage in the corner, hunched over his acoustic instrument, singing a mournful song about a lost love on the Isle of Wight ferry. The crowd was a mix of grizzled old men nursing pints, students with elaborate haircuts, and intense-looking couples who listened with their eyes closed. They were all focused, attentive. They were listening. The thought sent a jolt of pure ice through Sharon's veins.

“I’m going home,” she said, her voice swallowed by the noise. She had to lean in close to Lucia’s ear, her lips almost touching the leopard-print scarf. “You are certifiably insane. These are real musicians. People are paying attention. I’m going to get a taxi. I’ll see you tomorrow.” She made to turn, to retreat back into the quiet, predictable safety of the street, but Lucia’s hand clamped around her wrist like a beautifully manicured vise. Her grip was surprisingly strong.

“Don’t be ridiculous. Retreat is for the French,” Lucia stated, her eyes scanning the room, already plotting her next move. “This isn’t a performance, Shaz, it’s an intervention. You’ve been living your life at the correct water pressure, all sensible flow rates and no leaks. It’s time to burst a pipe. Metaphorically, of course. Your mother would never forgive me for an actual call-out.” She began to pull Sharon through the throng, parting the crowd not with force but with an aura of sheer, unshakeable purpose that made people instinctively step aside.

Sharon felt like a piece of debris being dragged along by the tide. Her work boots, which usually made her feel grounded and capable, felt like clumsy blocks of lead. The faded band t-shirt suddenly seemed pathetic, a flimsy costume that couldn't possibly disguise the fact she was a complete fraud. The man on stage finished his song to a ripple of warm, respectful applause. He murmured a quiet ‘thank you’ and the pub chatter swelled to fill the silence. He was good. His playing was intricate and clean. Sharon’s drumming was the sonic equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The two things couldn't exist in the same universe, let alone the same pub.

“He was good,” Sharon hissed at Lucia, her panic rising like bile. “They’ll throw things. They’ll throw beer mats. Or worse, the good china.”
“He was fine,” Lucia corrected, her gaze fixed on a shadowy figure hunched over the bar. “He was tidy. Precise. He was the musical equivalent of your sealant work, love. Admirable, but not exactly heart-stopping. We’re here for heart-stopping.” She finally stopped, planting them both near the end of the bar. “And you’re not going up alone. Did you really think I’d just throw you to the wolves? I’m your manager, not your executioner.”
Sharon stared at her, uncomprehending. “What are you talking about?”
“I told you I had a solution. The Henderson Problem isn’t that you’re too loud, it’s that you’re incomplete. A drum beat on its own is just noise. But a drum beat with a guitar? That’s a song. That’s art.” Lucia nodded towards the man at the bar. “That’s Gaz. He plays blues guitar. He’s all feel and no finesse, and his regular drummer has gone to find himself in a yurt in Wales. He needs a pulse. You are a pulse.”

Before Sharon could formulate a protest, Lucia had propelled her forward the last few feet. The man, Gaz, turned as they approached. He was older, maybe late fifties, with a weary face etched with deep lines and a formidable grey beard that looked like it had stories of its own to tell. He wore a denim jacket so worn it was almost white at the shoulders, and his eyes, small and sharp, took in Sharon from her steel-toed boots to her terrified expression. He looked less like a musician and more like a man who’d just finished a long shift wrestling bears.

“Lucia,” he grunted, his voice a low gravelly rumble. He took a sip of his pint and eyed Sharon again. “This the one?”
“This is the one,” Lucia confirmed, her voice bright and breezy, as if she were introducing people at a garden party. “Sharon, this is Gaz. Gaz, Sharon. She’s your new engine. A bit loud on the uptake, but pure horsepower once she gets going.”
Gaz gave a noncommittal grunt. He didn’t smile or offer a hand. He just stared at Sharon, his gaze so intense she felt like a faulty boiler he was trying to diagnose.
“Ever played the blues?” he asked.
Sharon’s mind went blank. The frantic allegro of Mr Henderson’s broom handle was the closest she’d come to a live collaboration. Her mouth opened and closed silently for a moment before she finally managed to find a word.
“No,” she said, her voice a thin, reedy thing. “I do toilets, mostly.”Gaz stared at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. A corner of his mouth twitched, and then, to Sharon's utter astonishment, a short, sharp bark of a laugh escaped his beard. It sounded like gravel being scraped from a barrel. “Honest, at least,” he rumbled, taking another slow swallow of his pint. “Better than the last lad. He said he did ‘sonic landscapes’. He couldn’t keep a beat if you nailed his foot to the floor.”

“See?” Lucia said, triumphant. “Common ground already. Sharon stops the leaks, Gaz plugs the gaps. It’s a match made in DIY heaven.” She turned her dazzling smile on Gaz. “She’s got a metronome in her soul, Gaz. All she needs is a reason to use it. A simple twelve-bar, something slow and dirty. Give her a beat to follow.”

“No,” Sharon repeated, her voice gaining a little more strength, fuelled by pure terror. “Lucia, this is a terrible idea. I can’t just go up there. I don’t know what a twelve-bar is. My entire repertoire consists of a Beatles intro and annoying a retired cartographer.”

Gaz finished his pint and set the empty glass down on the bar with a decisive clink. He finally looked at Sharon properly, his eyes less critical now, more appraising. “Can you count to four?” he asked, his voice dead serious. Sharon nodded dumbly. “And can you hit things?” She thought of the snare, the satisfying crack that felt like a problem being solved. She nodded again. “Then you can play the blues,” he concluded, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. He turned and started walking towards the stage, not even looking back to see if they were following. It wasn't an invitation; it was an instruction.

“Come on, Boudicca,” Lucia whispered, giving her a gentle but firm push forward. “Time for war.” The mournful ferry-singer was packing up his guitar, and the host, a man with a cheerful red face and a garish waistcoat, was stepping up to the microphone. “Right then, a little change of pace for you all. Put your hands together for a new combo tonight, give a big Anvil & Hammer welcome to Gaz and… and…” He looked expectantly towards the wings. Lucia cupped her hands around her mouth. “And Shaz!” she yelled, her voice cutting through the pub’s hum.

The name, her name, boomed through the speakers. A smattering of polite, curious applause broke out. It felt like a death sentence. Every nerve in Sharon’s body screamed at her to bolt for the fire exit. But her feet, encased in their heavy, dependable boots, kept moving forward, one after the other, as if piloted by someone else. She walked onto the small stage, blinking in the unexpectedly bright, hot lights. The drum kit was a deep red sparkle, far more glamorous than her own. The cymbals gleamed. It looked professional. It looked intimidating. It looked like it belonged to someone who knew what they were doing.

She clumsily navigated her way behind the kit and sat on the stool, which felt too high. Her hands were sweating, her heart hammering a frantic, chaotic rhythm against her ribs that was far too complex for her to ever hope to play. Gaz was already plugged in, his guitar, a battered butterscotch blonde Telecaster, slung low across his hip. He didn't look at the crowd. He didn't look at Sharon. He just stared down at his fretboard as if it held all the world’s secrets. The expectant hush of the pub was a physical weight, pressing down on her. She fumbled for the sticks, her blistered fingers clumsy and stiff. This was it. The ultimate mistake. More grievous than egg boxes, more catastrophic than Mr Henderson's plate. This was public humiliation on a scale she couldn’t have imagined an hour ago.

Gaz stamped his foot once. Twice. A slow, heavy beat like a coffin lid closing. Then, without a word of warning, a sound erupted from his amplifier. It wasn't a chord, or even a note, but a raw, snarling bend of a string, a sound that was pure, distilled feeling. It was the sound of a rusted stopcock finally giving way, of a cold morning, of a long and weary shift. It was a question, a complaint, and a story all at once. The sound hung in the air for a beat, and then he looked at her. His eyes, under the hot lights, weren't asking for perfection. They were just asking for a pulse. Sharon took a shaky breath, closed her eyes, and brought her steel-toed boot down on the kick drum pedal.

THUMP.

It was heavier than her own kick drum, deeper. A solid, resonant punch that she felt in her gut. Gaz’s guitar answered with a low, repeating riff, a simple, gritty pattern of notes that walked with a weary swagger. He kept it going, circling around the same phrase, laying a foundation. It was a road map, and all she had to do was follow it. She brought her right hand down on the ride cymbal, the big, gleaming disc to her right. It was meant to be a delicate *ting*, but her nerves made her hit it too hard, and a loud, messy *CLANG* washed through the room. A few people in the audience shifted in their seats. Sharon flinched, her face burning. This was it. The failure. But Gaz didn't stop. He didn't even look up. The riff just kept coming, steady and patient.

She took another breath, ignoring the shame. Forget the ride cymbal. Back to basics. She thought of her room, of the feeling of locking into a groove. *Thud. Tssk. Tak. Tssk.* Her foot found the kick drum again, matching Gaz’s stomping tempo. THUMP. Then, she brought the sticks together on the rim of the snare. Click. A simple backbeat. THUMP. Click. THUMP. Click. It was stark, skeletal, barely a beat at all. It was the drum equivalent of drawing a stick figure. But it was in time. It was a heartbeat. Gaz gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod, and the riff he was playing seemed to settle, to find its footing on the simple pulse she was laying down.

He began to build on it, his fingers moving with a surprising, arthritic grace over the worn maple neck. The notes bent and cried, telling a story of their own. Sharon listened, really listened, not just to the notes but to the spaces in between. When he left a gap, she instinctively filled it with a sharp crack of the snare. When his riff chugged low and heavy, she kept the kick drum solid and simple underneath it. Her limbs were still four uncooperative employees, but now they had a clear job to do. Kick and snare. The foundations. Don’t get fancy. Don’t try to impress. Just be the engine. Just be the pulse.

The first song—or what she assumed was a song—bled into a second. Gaz just changed the tempo, slowing it down to a funereal pace, his guitar weeping mournful, long notes. Sharon slowed with him, her simple beat becoming heavier, more deliberate. THUMP... THWACK... THUMP... THWACK... It was the sound of a long walk home in the rain. She felt a strange sense of detachment, as if she were watching someone else play. The terror was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was being overlaid with something else. A fierce, powerful concentration. The world had shrunk to the space between her, Gaz, and the beat they were building together, brick by painstaking brick, in the hot, smoky air of The Anvil & Hammer.They played three songs, or maybe it was one long, sprawling blues meditation that shifted its shape and mood without ever breaking its spine. Sharon lost track. The world outside the bright circle of stage lights ceased to exist. She was no longer Sharon the Plumber, worrying about Mr Henderson’s commemorative plate or her mother’s disapproval. She was just a pair of hands, a pair of feet, and a thudding heart, all locked into the raw, elemental story that Gaz was telling with his six strings. Her playing remained brutally simple, but it was no longer hesitant. It was deliberate. It was an anchor in the storm of his wailing, distorted notes. She was the full stop he needed, the solid ground beneath his feet.

During the third song, a faster, chugging rhythm that felt like a runaway train, Gaz leaned into a solo. His eyes were closed, his face contorted in concentration as he wrung a flurry of notes from the neck of his guitar. The music built, a wave of sound cresting higher and higher, and Sharon felt something shift inside her. A reckless impulse. She was holding the beat steady—THUMP-hiss-THWACK-hiss—but the music was demanding more. It wanted a response. On the final beat of a phrase, just before the riff was due to circle back, she did something she hadn't planned. Her right hand, instead of hitting the snare, moved instinctively over to the tom-toms. It was a simple, three-note fill. *Da-da-dum*. It wasn't clean. It wasn't flashy. It was probably a beat late. But it was a sentence of her own. A comment on the story he was telling.

The world didn't end. The beat didn't collapse. For a split second after she did it, Gaz’s eyes flickered open and met hers. There was no anger, no annoyance. There was just a glint of surprise, and something else that looked almost like a challenge. He dug in harder, his riff becoming more aggressive, and Sharon met him, her beat growing in confidence. The simple click on the off-beat became a solid THWACK of the snare. She was no longer just the engine; she was part of the conversation. She was the sound of the problem being decisively solved, but this time, the problem was silence.

The end came abruptly. Gaz struck a final, discordant chord that shivered and hung in the air like a question mark, and Sharon brought her foot and both sticks down at once on the kick, snare, and crash cymbal. The resulting sound was a glorious, definitive crash-bang-thump. A full stop. The silence that followed was absolute, a black hole of sound. For a heart-stopping second, Sharon thought they had failed so spectacularly that they had stunned the entire pub into horrified quiet. She opened her eyes, her chest heaving, her T-shirt soaked through with sweat. The lights felt hotter than ever.

Then, from the darkness beyond the stage, came a single, clear sound. Someone clapping. It was followed by another, and another, and then the entire room erupted. It wasn’t the polite, respectful ripple the acoustic singer had received. This was a roar. It was loud, messy, and whole-hearted, punctuated by whistles and cheers. It was the sound of a crowd that had been taken somewhere and was grateful for the journey. The wave of noise hit Sharon with a physical force, and she felt a giddy, disbelieving laugh bubble up in her throat. She looked at Lucia, who was standing on a chair, both fists in the air, beaming like she’d just personally discovered fire.

Gaz unplugged his guitar, the sudden pop and hum from the amp a small, private sound in the midst of the public roar. He gave the crowd a curt nod, a gesture of acknowledgement so brief it was almost missed. Then he turned to Sharon as she shakily put the sticks down on the snare drum. Her arms ached, her ears were ringing, and her blisters were screaming, but she had never felt more alive. “Alright,” Gaz said, his voice the same low gravel as before. He looked her up and down, then gave a single, slow nod. “You’ll do.” Coming from him, it sounded like a knighthood.

Stumbling off the stage on legs that felt like jelly, Sharon was immediately enveloped in a hug by Lucia, who smelled of triumph and perfume. “Boudicca!” she shrieked in Sharon's ear. “You didn’t just knock on the door, you kicked it off its hinges! Did you see their faces? They were mesmerised! You were magnificent!” Sharon could only lean on her, speechless, her body thrumming with adrenaline and the ghost of the beat. She felt dazed, like she’d just woken from a strange and violent dream. She saw the man with the red waistcoat approaching, a wide grin on his face. “Next Tuesday, yeah? Same time?” he asked, already holding a pencil over a booking sheet. Before Sharon could even process the question, Lucia answered for her. “She’ll be here,” she confirmed, with the air of a manager closing a multi-million-pound deal. "But her fee's gone up."The journey home was a blur of roaring engine and rushing air. The little Spitfire tore through the deserted late-night streets of Portsmouth, its headlights cutting sharp yellow wedges out of the darkness. Lucia drove with one hand on the wheel, the other gesticulating wildly as she replayed the entire evening in a breathless, high-speed monologue. Sharon sat slumped in the passenger seat, mute, the ringing in her ears a constant high-frequency hum beneath Lucia’s commentary. Her muscles ached in places she didn’t know she had, and her work boots felt three sizes too big. She felt hollowed out, scoured clean by noise and adrenaline. The world outside the car seemed slow and indistinct, a watercolour painting left out in the rain.

“The way he looked at you after that first fill!” Lucia was saying, her voice ecstatic. “That wasn’t just surprise, Shaz, that was respect! You could see it! He’s been playing that same weary blues riff for thirty years and you just walked in and gave it a spine! A proper, steel-reinforced, Southsea-guesthouse-grade spine!” She didn't seem to require or expect a response. Her own excitement was a self-sustaining fusion reaction, throwing off enough energy for both of them. Sharon just stared at the passing terraced houses, their windows dark and sleeping, and wondered if any of it had actually happened. The memory of the applause felt like a phantom limb, a sensation she could feel but couldn't quite believe was real.

Lucia pulled up outside the house, the Spitfire’s engine dying with a final, throaty gurgle. The sudden silence of the street was as loud as the music had been. All Sharon could hear was the distant clang of a ship’s buoy and the frantic, uneven thumping of her own heart. The house stood waiting, a dark shape against a navy-blue sky, looking just as it always did. Implacable. Ancient. Judgmental. Lucia leaned across, her leopard-print scarf brushing Sharon’s cheek. “Next Tuesday,” she said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. Her eyes gleamed. “The revolution has begun. Don’t you dare let the old guard win.” She gave Sharon’s arm a squeeze and then she was gone, the Spitfire roaring back to life and disappearing around the corner, leaving only the smell of exhaust fumes and a faint trail of possibility.

The key felt cold and alien in Sharon’s trembling hand. As she pushed the front door open, the familiar scent of Pledge and her mother’s rose-scented potpourri rushed to meet her, a stark contrast to the pub’s atmosphere of stale beer and ambition. A single lamp was on in the living room, casting long, soft shadows. And there, sitting in her armchair with a book lying open and unread in her lap, was Val. She wasn’t wearing her pinny; she was in her dressing gown, the one with the faded lavender pattern. She had been waiting up. Sharon’s brief, fragile sense of triumph evaporated, replaced by the familiar, weary weight of expectation. Her sweat-damp t-shirt suddenly felt cold against her skin.

“It’s past midnight,” Val said. Her voice wasn't sharp or angry, which was somehow worse. It was flat, exhausted. “I was worried.” She looked at Sharon, her gaze taking in the faded band shirt, the flush on her cheeks, the way she was still vibrating with a nervous energy that didn't belong in this quiet, orderly house. “You smell of smoke.”

“It was a pub, Mam,” Sharon said, her voice raspy. She closed the door softly behind her. “They tend to be smoky.”
“That Lucia,” Val continued, as if Sharon hadn’t spoken. “She’s a bad influence. Always has been. Filling your head with nonsense. What was all that about? That racket she made with her car horn? Mr Henderson nearly came out in his pyjamas.” She finally closed her book, the gesture one of quiet finality. “This isn’t right, Sharon. Sneaking around, coming home at all hours. What would your father say?”

That was the nuclear option. Invoking her late father, a man whose life had been a monument to quiet routine and predictable stability, was Val’s ultimate expression of disapproval. The old Sharon would have flinched, mumbled an apology, and fled upstairs. But the applause was still a faint echo in her ears. Gaz’s gruff “You’ll do” was a shield. She walked into the living room and sank onto the edge of the sofa, her aching body grateful for the rest. “He’d probably say I should check the fan belt on Lucia’s car,” she said, her voice steady. “But I don’t think that’s what you mean.”

She looked at her mother, at the deep lines of worry etched around her eyes. It wasn’t just about the noise. It was about change. It was about her daughter, the dependable plumber, the godsend with the neat sealant, suddenly becoming an unknown quantity. “They liked it,” Sharon said quietly, more to herself than to her mother. “The people there. They listened. We played, and they clapped.” She looked down at her hands, at the callouses and the angry red blisters living side-by-side. “It felt… good. It felt like I was supposed to be there.”

Val just shook her head, a small, sad gesture of incomprehension. “You’re supposed to be here, love. With a proper job. With a pension plan. Not in some noisy pub with strange men, making a spectacle of yourself. That’s a young person’s game. It’s a road to disappointment.” She stood up and went to the kitchen, the familiar ritual of making a late-night cup of tea a comforting, automatic response to a situation she didn’t understand. The conversation was over. They had reached their usual impasse, two people standing on opposite sides of a generational and temperamental gulf too wide to shout across.

Sharon took the cup of tea—the good china again, a silent truce—and went upstairs. The house was quiet around her, creaking and groaning as it settled into the cold sea mist. She pushed open the door to the spare room. The drum kit sat waiting in the dim light from the hallway. It no longer looked like a monster, or a promise of failure. It looked like a tool. It looked like her tool, just as much as the wrenches and pipe-cutters in her van. She walked over and sat on the stool, the worn vinyl cool against her legs. She didn’t pick up the sticks. She just sat there, in the room that smelled of chicken and futility and now, faintly, of triumph. She ran a hand over the smooth, taut skin of the snare drum. THWACK. The sound of a problem being decisively solved. She had thought the problem was a leaking washer or a rusted stopcock. But maybe the problem had been the silence. Next Tuesday. The thought wasn't terrifying anymore. It was a beacon. It was a beat. And she couldn't wait to play it.The next morning, Sharon found herself wedged under a sink in a terraced house not far from her own, a fine mist of limescale-scented water spraying her face from a leaking compression joint. The homeowner, a woman with an anxious-looking Jack Russell terrier that kept sniffing her boots, was explaining the intricate history of the leak in painstaking detail. Sharon grunted responses at what she hoped were the appropriate intervals, but her mind was elsewhere. The rhythmic *drip… drip… drip…* into the plastic basin beside her head was a slow, maddeningly off-beat metronome. In her head, she was correcting it, adding a deep kick drum on the one and a sharp snare on the three, turning the sound of domestic failure into a slow, lamenting blues.

Her hands, operating on a decade of muscle memory, deftly tightened the nut, silencing the spray. As she worked the wrench, her thumb tapped out a silent shuffle pattern against the cold metal. Everything was a rhythm today. The rumble of a passing bus was a long, sustained tom roll. The chattering of schoolchildren in the street was the scattered, chaotic energy of a cymbal crash. Her day job, usually a world of satisfyingly concrete problems and tangible solutions, now felt like a pale, monochrome photograph compared to the chaotic, vibrant colour of the night before. The world of stopcocks and U-bends was governed by predictable physics, but the world of a twelve-bar blues was governed by something else entirely, something akin to magic. The quiet satisfaction of a perfectly sealed joint was nothing compared to the roaring, public validation of that applause.

That evening, after another tense, mostly silent meal with Val, Sharon went upstairs not with a sense of angry defiance, but with a feeling of purpose. She pushed the door to the spare room open and switched on the single bare bulb. The battered Pearl kit gleamed, looking less like a weapon and more like a puzzle she was just beginning to understand. Instead of launching straight into the clumsy, cathartic thumping of ‘Come Together’, she pulled her phone from her pocket, propped it against the stack of National Geographics, and typed ‘simple blues drum shuffle’ into the search bar. She watched a dozen videos, her eyes glued to the screen as drummers from all over the world broke down the deceptively simple beat. It was all in the wrist, in the bounce of the stick, in the subtle ‘ghost notes’ on the snare that whispered in the gaps between the main hits.

She picked up the sticks and, for the first time, placed the rubber practice pad on the snare drum. The unsatisfying thud was still there, but she wasn't looking for satisfaction. She was looking for control. She spent an hour just on her right hand, trying to master the swinging *da-da-dum, da-da-dum* of the shuffle pattern on the hi-hat, her wrist aching with the unfamiliar motion. Then she added her left, trying to drop the snare hit squarely on the backbeat. It was painstaking, frustrating work. It felt less like rock and roll and more like revision for an exam she was sure she was going to fail. But every so often, for a fleeting moment, her limbs would align, and the rhythm would lock into place. In those brief seconds, she could hear it – the ghost of Gaz’s guitar, the memory of the living, breathing thing they had created together. It was enough.

Later in the week, as she was dragging the wheelie bins out to the curb, a movement in the neighbouring garden caught her eye. Mr Henderson was on his knees, meticulously weeding his fuchsia bed, his back to her. Sharon froze, her hand on the lid of the bin, bracing herself for the inevitable tirade about falling admirals and collapsing property values. He must have sensed her presence, because he straightened up slowly, wincing as his knees cracked. He turned, his face set in its usual stern lines, and wiped a gloved hand on his trousers. Sharon prepared her apology, her defence, her retreat. But he didn't shout.

“My niece was at The Anvil on Tuesday,” he said, his voice as dry as the dust that had fallen from her ceiling rose. The statement hung in the air between them, over the low garden wall that had served as his percussion instrument. Sharon’s mouth went dry. She had no idea what to say. "Oh," was all she managed. Mr Henderson picked up a trowel and pointed it at her, not aggressively, but as if making a careful observation. “She said you were… loud,” he stated. Sharon flinched. “But she also said you were surprisingly adequate. Said you kept a decent beat for the guitarist.” He paused, looking at his prize-winning flowers as if they held the key to his next thought. “Blues, she said it was. Not my cup of tea. Too many feelings. Give me a military tattoo any day. Proper drumming.” He turned back to his weeding, his posture indicating the conversation was over. “Still, better than that racket you were making before. At least the blues has a structure.”

Sharon stood by the bin, completely stunned. It wasn’t a compliment. It wasn’t forgiveness. But it was a reclassification. She had been upgraded from a public nuisance to a purveyor of structured, if overly emotional, music. It was the most backhanded, reluctant olive branch she had ever received, and it felt like a monumental victory. As she went back inside, she could have sworn the front door creaked in a perfect twelve-bar shuffle.The following Tuesday arrived with the grim inevitability of a final demand notice. For five days, Sharon had existed in a strange dual state. By day, she was Sharon the Plumber, her knuckles scraped raw from wrestling with corroded stopcocks in damp cupboards, her ears attuned to the subtle difference between a water hammer and a trapped airlock. But by night, she was Sharon the Student, hunched over her practice pad in the spare room, her world shrunk to the bounce of a stick and the syncopated swing of a YouTube tutorial. The frantic allegro of Mr Henderson’s broom handle had been replaced by the patient, looping rhythm of a recorded shuffle beat, a pulse she tried to lock into until her wrists burned and her focus blurred. She felt like she was learning a new language, one where the grammar was made of time signatures and the vocabulary was a series of controlled impacts.

The tension in the house had solidified into a thick, polite silence. Val had stopped making direct comments about "that racket", employing instead a strategy of weaponised domesticity. She had twice, with great ceremony, brought out an old photo album and sat opposite Sharon at the Formica table, sighing wistfully over pictures of a five-year-old Sharon at a ballet class. She had started cooking elaborate, time-consuming meals on the evenings Sharon was trying to practice, filling the house with the scent of shepherd's pie and disapproval, the clatter of her oven door serving as a passive-aggressive counter-rhythm to the muffled thuds from upstairs. It was a siege, and Val was banking on a blockade of nostalgia and roast potatoes to bring her daughter back to her senses. Sharon just ate the pie, complimented the gravy, and retreated back to the company of her rubber pad and her growing collection of blisters.

Lucia arrived again at seven, this time with a more subdued toot of the horn. When Sharon slid into the Spitfire’s cramped passenger seat, Lucia handed her a brown paper bag. “Gig fuel,” she announced. Inside was a lukewarm steak bake and a can of cheap energy drink. “And this.” She passed over a neatly folded black T-shirt. On the front, in stark white letters, was the simple, elegant logo of the drum manufacturer, Ludwig. “Every serious drummer needs a serious T-shirt. It’s in the rules. You’re officially trading up from ‘fan’ to ‘practitioner’.” Sharon looked down at her own faded gig shirt, then at the crisp, new one in her lap. It felt like being handed a uniform, a new identity to step into. “So I’m a practitioner now?” she asked, a small smile playing on her lips. “Not a revolutionary?” Lucia grinned, pulling away from the curb. “Oh, the revolution is ongoing. But even revolutionaries need the right branding.”

Walking into The Anvil & Hammer for the second time was a completely different experience. The wall of heat and noise was still there, but it was no longer a hostile force. It was familiar. The man with the red waistcoat gave her a cheerful thumbs-up from behind the bar. A couple of faces in the crowd nodded at her with vague recognition. It wasn't fame; it was the quiet, unassuming acceptance of a local. She felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach, but it wasn't the gut-wrenching terror of the previous week. This was a different flavour of fear: the fear of not being as good as they remembered. The fear of being a one-hit wonder. Gaz was already at the bar, nursing the same pint in the same spot, a denim-clad gargoyle guarding the stage. He saw them approach and gave Sharon a slow, appraising look. “You came back,” he grunted. It wasn't a question. “Lucia said it was in the contract,” Sharon replied, finding a sliver of confidence she didn't know she possessed. Gaz’s beard twitched. It might have been a smile. “There’s no contract,” he rumbled, and turned towards the stage.

This time, when she sat behind the gleaming red kit, it felt less like a cockpit and more like a workbench. The stool was still too high, but she knew how to adjust it. The sticks didn't feel like foreign objects. She arranged the drums to her liking, shifting the snare a half-inch to the left, angling the ride cymbal down. They were small adjustments, but they were hers. She was no longer a guest; she was at work. Gaz stamped his foot, the familiar one-two count, and launched into a riff. It was another slow blues, but this one had a different edge, a note of impatience in its swagger. Sharon took a breath, counted herself in, and fell into the shuffle beat she had been painstakingly practicing all week. *Da-da-dum, da-da-dum.* Her hi-hat work was still clumsy, the swing more of a lurch, but the core beat was there. Kick on the one and three. Snare on the two and four. It was the house’s foundation, the load-bearing wall of the song.

They played for twenty minutes, the music a living thing that ebbed and flowed between them. Sharon found herself listening more intently than ever, not just to Gaz’s guitar, but to the room itself. She could hear the spaces he was leaving for her, the moments where the music needed to breathe, the points where it needed a push. She was still sticking to the basics, terrified of derailing the whole thing with a misplaced fill. But then, in the middle of their third song, Gaz did something new. He broke from his riff and played a short, sharp melodic phrase, a musical question that hung in the air. He played it again, looking directly at her, his eyebrows raised over the top of his guitar. It was a prompt. An instruction. He was asking for a response. Her heart hammered. The safe thing was to ignore it, to keep the beat steady and reliable. But Lucia’s voice echoed in her head: *You gave it a spine*. Spines had to bend. She answered his phrase not with a clumsy tom-tom roll, but with a sharp, choked smack on the crash cymbal, cutting its resonance short with her hand, a percussive exclamation mark. *CLANG-tsh!* Gaz’s eyes widened for a fraction of a second, and then a genuine, undeniable grin spread across his face, visible even through the beard. He tore into his solo, the notes flying from his fingers with a newfound fire, and Sharon, her confidence surging, drove the beat home, a solid, unshakeable pulse in the heart of the beautiful noise.The Tuesday night gigs at The Anvil & Hammer became the new rhythm of Sharon’s life, a weekly appointment that re-calibrated her internal clock. The first Tuesday had been terror. The second, a challenge. By the fifth, it was simply what she did. The terror had not vanished entirely, but it had subsided into a low, thrumming hum of nervous energy that she was learning to harness, a fuel for her focus. Each week, she would pack her new Ludwig T-shirt and a pair of sticks into her work bag, the smooth, turned wood feeling as essential as her favourite box spanner. The crowd at the pub grew, slowly at first, then with a tangible momentum. It was no longer just the regulars; new faces started appearing, drawn in by word of mouth about the ‘grizzly bluesman and the plumber who hits like a piledriver’.

The dynamic with Gaz was also evolving, shifting from a simple employer-employee relationship into a grudging, non-verbal partnership. Conversations were still minimal, consisting mostly of grunts, nods, and the occasional technical query about a tempo. But on stage, they were learning each other’s language. Gaz would throw out more complex musical phrases, testing her, and Sharon, growing bolder, would answer with tight, punchy fills or a sudden, dramatic silence. She learned to read the subtle shifts in his posture, the dip of his shoulder that meant he was about to slow down, the upward tilt of his chin that heralded a blistering solo. Once, during a particularly swampy, low-down blues number, the strap on his old Telecaster broke. Without missing a beat, Sharon kept the simple, hypnotic THUMP… THWACK… going, holding the song together while he, with a surprising lack of panic, knelt on the stage and re-tied the worn leather with a piece of string he produced from his pocket. The crowd had cheered the seamless recovery, but the look Gaz gave her afterwards was more valuable: a flicker of genuine gratitude.

This new, noisy confidence did not go unnoticed at home. Val’s campaign of passive resistance escalated. The photo albums were joined by carefully curated anecdotes about Sharon’s childhood achievements: the prize she won for a neat handwriting competition, the time she’d patiently fixed the chain on her mother’s bicycle. The subtext was always the same: *This is who you are. Neat. Patient. Quiet. Not… that.* One evening, Sharon came home from a plumbing emergency, covered in grime and smelling of drain cleaner, to find the spare room door closed. When she pushed it open, she stopped dead. The room had been tidied. The stacks of National Geographics were gone, a vase of aggressively cheerful daffodils sat on the windowsill, and a lace doily had been placed on the small table next to her drum kit. The practice pad was hidden. The whole room smelled faintly of lavender polish. It was an invasion, a quiet, floral-scented declaration of war. Val was trying to reclaim the territory, to domesticate the beast, to turn Sharon’s sanctuary of noise back into just a spare room.

The inevitable confrontation came after the seventh Tuesday gig. The set had been their best yet. They had been tight, energetic, and Sharon had even managed a complex paradiddle fill that had come out exactly as she'd practiced it. The applause had been thunderous. She arrived home after one, buzzing and exhausted, to find Val waiting at the kitchen table, a single, stark bulb overhead illuminating the grim set of her mouth. There was no tea this time. Just a folded newspaper on the table. “You’re in the paper,” Val said, her voice devoid of any warmth. She pushed the local evening news towards Sharon. It was folded open to the entertainment page. There was a small, grainy photo of Gaz and Sharon on stage, and a short review of the open mic night. The headline read: ‘Anvil’s Hammer-Time Blues Duo A Must-See’. The writer described Gaz’s ‘authentic, gravel-road guitar’ and Sharon’s ‘powerhouse drumming that provides a foundation of granite’.

Sharon stared at the words. *Powerhouse drumming. A foundation of granite.* It was real. It was in print. A wave of elation washed over her, so potent it almost made her dizzy. She looked up at her mother, expecting… what? Not pride, maybe, but at least an acknowledgement. Instead, Val’s face was a mask of deep disappointment. “A spectacle,” Val whispered, her voice trembling slightly. “My daughter, a spectacle in a pub. ‘Sharon the plumber who hits like a piledriver’. That’s what Mrs Higgins from the corner shop called you this afternoon. She thought it was hilarious. Is that what you want to be? A joke? A novelty act for the whole of Portsmouth to laugh at?” The word ‘joke’ pierced Sharon’s elation like a pin. “They weren’t laughing, Mam. They were clapping. It’s not a joke. It’s music.” “It’s noise and it’s embarrassing!” Val’s voice finally broke, rising in pitch. “Your father… your father worked his whole life for a bit of peace, a bit of respectability. He would be mortified. Mortified! A girl your age, banging away on those dreadful things instead of settling down. It’s not natural.” “What’s not natural?” Sharon shot back, her own voice rising, the adrenaline from the gig finding a new, angry outlet. “Having a passion? Doing something I love? Something I’m good at? All my life I’ve been the sensible one, the one who fixes things, who makes things quiet and orderly. For once, I’m making something for myself, something loud and messy and mine, and you can’t stand it!” The two women faced each other across the small Formica table, the newspaper clipping a flimsy piece of evidence between them. The chasm that had been silently widening for weeks was now a gaping, echoing canyon.

Lucia, of course, had been the one to tip off the newspaper. “All press is good press, my love,” she’d declared down the phone the next day, cheerfully unrepentant when Sharon recounted the fight with her mother. “Even a grainy photo in the Portsmouth Evening News is a step on the ladder. It makes you real. It gives you a narrative. We’ll meet after your job tomorrow. The Anvil. Three o’clock. Gaz is coming. We need to have a board meeting.” A board meeting. Lucia had a flair for turning a chat in a pub into a corporate summit. Sharon agreed, feeling a sense of weary resignation. Her world was now officially split into two warring territories: the quiet, tense front line of her home, and the noisy, chaotic potential of the band.

The Anvil & Hammer was a different creature in the afternoon. Sunlight, thick with dust motes, streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating sticky patches on the floor and giving the whole place a sleepy, hungover air. Gaz was already there, hunched in a booth with a cup of tea, looking strangely diminished without the stage lights and the wall of sound. Lucia swept in moments after Sharon, carrying a battered notebook and an air of grand purpose. “Right,” she began, before she had even sat down, flipping open the notebook. “Phase one: Establish residency and generate buzz. Complete.” She drew a large, dramatic tick in the book. “Phase two: Expand our horizons. Now, the landlord loves us. The crowd loves us. We’re officially a big fish in a very small, slightly-stale-ale-smelling pond. It’s time to find a bigger pond.” Gaz took a slow sip of his tea. “I like this pond,” he grunted. “Of course you do, it’s comfortable,” Lucia retorted, not unkindly. “But comfort is the enemy of art. I’ve been making calls. There’s a venue in Brighton, The Engine Room. Proper place. Decent PA, a stage you don’t have to climb onto, and an audience that isn’t fifty percent retired dock workers.” Sharon’s stomach lurched. Brighton. That was another town. Another level of seriousness. “We can’t just go and play in Brighton,” she said, her voice small. “We only know about five songs. And they’re all basically the same song, just at different speeds.” “Precisely!” Lucia beamed, pointing a pen at her. “Which brings me to item two on the agenda: a bass player.” Gaz let out a long-suffering sigh. “Here we go.”

“Don’t ‘here we go’ me, you old cynic,” Lucia said, her tone sharp. “You know I’m right. We need a bottom end. We need a groove. Sharon is the foundation, you’re the fancy brickwork, but we need the cement to hold it all together. A bass player would open everything up. We could move beyond the twelve-bar, write some actual songs.” “I don’t write songs,” Gaz mumbled into his tea. “I play the blues.” “The blues is just three chords and the truth, darling,” Lucia shot back. “We just need to find someone else who knows the same three chords.” She looked at Sharon. “What do you think, Shaz? You’re the rhythm section. You have a say.”

It was the first time her opinion had been solicited as a genuine creative partner. Sharon felt a sudden pressure. She thought about the music, the way it sometimes felt empty in the low registers, the way her kick drum felt like it was punching at air. She thought about the review—'a foundation of granite'—and knew, with a plumber’s practical certainty, that a foundation was useless without a complete structure built on top of it. “She’s right,” Sharon said, surprising even herself. “It needs… more weight. Down low.” Gaz looked from Lucia to Sharon, a flicker of something—betrayal? resignation?—in his eyes. He was being outvoted. The simple, uncomplicated duo he’d stumbled into was threatening to become a proper band, with all the complications and compromises that entailed. He drained his cup and stood up. “Fine,” he said, the single word carrying a mountain of reluctance. “You find someone. But if they play a six-string bass or try to do a slap solo, I’m out.” He walked away towards the bar, his shoulders hunched. Lucia watched him go, a satisfied smile on her face. She turned back to Sharon, her eyes gleaming with victory. “Excellent. The board has passed the motion. Phase two is officially underway.” She leaned forward, her voice dropping. “I may already have someone in mind.”Lucia’s mysterious bass player remained a ghost for the rest of the week, a hypothetical disruption that Sharon both dreaded and craved. The silence at home had become a brittle, fragile thing, liable to shatter at the slightest provocation. Val moved through the house with the quiet, martyred air of someone tending to a terminally ill patient, her sighs punctuating the household quiet like muffled drum beats. She had taken to leaving brochures for evening classes on the kitchen table – pottery, conversational Spanish, flower arranging – little paper ambassadors from the world of sensible hobbies she so desperately wanted her daughter to inhabit. Sharon would dutifully move them to the recycling bin, a small, weekly act of rebellion that felt both petty and essential. Her practice time had become her only real sanctuary, the controlled chaos of a paradiddle a welcome antidote to the suffocating stillness of her mother’s disappointment.

When the next Tuesday rolled around, Sharon arrived at The Anvil & Hammer to find Lucia already installed in their usual booth. But she wasn't alone. Sitting opposite her, nursing a glass of water with a slice of lemon, was a young woman who seemed to absorb the dim pub light rather than reflect it. She was probably in her mid-twenties, with a sharp, angular haircut and clothes that were an exercise in minimalist black. She possessed a stillness that was the polar opposite of Lucia’s restless energy; where Lucia was a firework, this woman was a deep, cool well. A long, sleek, black hardshell case leaned against the worn leather of the booth beside her. It was a bass guitar case, but it looked less like a musical instrument carrier and more like a piece of advanced weaponry.

“Sharon, darling! Punctual as a pressure valve,” Lucia chirped, her smile a little too bright. “This is Maya. Maya, this is our powerhouse, Sharon.” Maya looked up, her dark, intelligent eyes giving nothing away. She didn't smile, but offered a slight nod. “Hey,” she said, her voice low and calm. It was a voice you’d have to lean in to hear in a quiet room, let alone a noisy pub. Sharon, suddenly feeling clumsy and oversized in her work boots, mumbled a hello and slid into the booth next to Lucia, her heart starting to perform a frantic, unscheduled solo. This was her. This was the cement. She looked more like a shard of obsidian. At that moment, Gaz pushed through the pub door, his denim jacket looking even more worn in the afternoon light. He spotted the three of them in the booth, his eyes immediately locking on Maya and her formidable guitar case. His face, already set in its customary grim lines, seemed to visibly harden. He stomped over to the bar without a word and ordered a pint, his back to them a rigid wall of disapproval.

“He’s taking it well,” Maya observed dryly, taking a slow sip of her water. Lucia waved a dismissive hand. “He’s a traditionalist. He thinks anything invented after 1958 is witchcraft. He’ll come around once he hears you play.” She clapped her hands together. “Right! Sound check! Let’s make some magic.” The pub was mostly empty, save for the landlord, Barry, who was polishing glasses, and a solitary old man reading a racing form in the corner. It felt less like a rehearsal and more like a sterile, high-stakes audition under fluorescent lights. They clambered onto the stage, the awkwardness between them a tangible thing. Maya unlatched her case with a series of sharp, satisfying clicks and lifted out a bass guitar that looked as sleek and modern as she did. It was a deep, metallic grey, with no pickguard and a bewildering array of knobs. Gaz, who was plugging in his battered Telecaster, eyed it with deep suspicion, as if it might suddenly start making synth noises.

“Simple twelve-bar in E,” Gaz grunted, not looking at anyone. He stamped his foot twice, a command rather than an invitation. He launched into his familiar, gritty riff, the notes full of gravel and complaint. Sharon took a breath, counted to four, and brought her foot down, laying down the solid, dependable shuffle she had practiced into her muscle memory. *THUMP-hiss-THWACK-hiss.* For a few bars, it was just the two of them, the familiar sound of their Tuesday nights. Then, Maya came in. The sound that emerged from her amplifier was nothing like Sharon had expected. It was a deep, round, and astonishingly clear tone that seemed to fill the entire room. It didn't just sit under the guitar; it wrapped around it, supporting it, conversing with it. She wasn't just playing the root notes. Her fingers moved with a fluid, spider-like grace, weaving a melodic line that was a song in itself. It locked in with Sharon’s kick drum instantly, creating a groove so deep and solid you could have built a house on it.

Sharon felt it immediately, a physical sensation that ran up from the floor, through the drum stool, and into her spine. The groove was immense. Her simple beat suddenly had a partner, a dancer who knew all the steps she was only just thinking of. She felt herself relax, her playing becoming looser, more confident. The swing of her hi-hat felt more natural, her snare hits punchier. They were a rhythm section. A real one. The music swelled, sounding bigger, richer, and more professional than it ever had before. Then, as Gaz’s riff came around to the end of the twelve-bar cycle, Maya’s fingers flew across the fretboard in a quick, bubbling run of notes that climbed and fell with a jazzy, sophisticated flair before landing perfectly back on the root note for the next verse. It was beautiful. It was complex. And it was the last straw for Gaz. He stopped playing abruptly, leaving a gaping hole in the sound. “What in God’s name was that?” he snarled, pointing the neck of his guitar at Maya as if it were a weapon.

Maya didn't flinch. She simply let her last note sustain, her expression unreadable. “A transition,” she said calmly. “It links the V chord back to the I.” “It sounds like a bloody shopping channel,” Gaz shot back, his face flushing a dull red. “This is the blues, not a cocktail party. Play the root, the fifth, and shut up.” From the floor, Lucia let out an audible sigh. But Maya just tilted her head, considering him. “The root and the fifth are a fence,” she replied, her voice still quiet but with an edge of steel. “The notes in between are the garden. You’re just playing the fence posts.” Gaz looked like he might actually explode. He seemed to swell with indignation, his hands tightening on his guitar. For a moment, Sharon thought he was going to walk out, that the band would implode right there on the grubby stage of The Anvil & Hammer before it had even truly begun. The silence stretched, thick with tension.

It was Sharon who broke it. She didn’t say anything. She just started playing. A slow, heavy beat. THUMP… THWACK… THUMP… THWACK… It was the sound of a long walk home in the rain, the first beat she and Gaz had ever truly locked into together. It was a reminder. A plea. Gaz looked over at her, the anger in his eyes warring with his ingrained musical instincts. The beat was a question, and he knew the answer. With a long, shuddering exhale of breath, he let his shoulders slump and brought his fingers back to the fretboard. He started a new riff, slower this time, more mournful. Maya waited, listening, and when she came in, she had taken his note. She played the root, then the fifth, holding the notes long and low. She was building the fence. But then, in the spaces Gaz left, she would add just one extra note—a subtle blue note, a passing tone—that hinted at the garden without trampling all over it. It was a compromise. A conversation. The music they made was sparse, filled with a melancholy tension, but it was whole. It was the sound of three people listening. They finished the song, and the final, mournful chord hung in the dusty afternoon air. Barry, the landlord, who had stopped polishing glasses to listen, started clapping from behind the bar. “Sounding mighty fine,” he called out. “Proper band, now.” Lucia looked up at the stage, a triumphant smile spreading across her face. She didn’t look at Gaz. She looked at Sharon. Her expression was clear. *Your call.* Sharon looked at Gaz’s rigid back, then at Maya’s calm, expectant face. She thought of the review, of the bigger ponds, of the vast, empty space in the music that had now been filled. She was the foundation. And the foundation had just become twice as strong. “She plays,” Sharon said, her voice clear and steady in the quiet pub. “She plays.” Gaz just grunted, a low, rumbling sound of reluctant defeat. He didn’t turn around, but he didn’t unplug his guitar, either. It was the closest to a consensus they were ever going to get.The first official gig as a trio was a tightrope walk over a canyon of egos. On stage, a fragile truce held. Maya, true to her word, stuck mostly to the fence posts, her playing economical and supportive, her formidable technique leashed like a well-trained guard dog. But every now and then, in the turnarounds or during the briefest of pauses, she would let a single, perfect note of colour bleed through – a suspended chord, a melodic seventh – that made the simple blues progression ache with a new, sophisticated melancholy. Gaz, for his part, played with a kind of focused fury, his solos more jagged and raw than ever, as if he were trying to sandblast Maya’s smooth, modern polish off the music with sheer grit. Caught between these two opposing forces, Sharon found her role had fundamentally changed. She was no longer just the engine; she was the gearbox, the translator, the one who had to absorb the shock of Gaz’s raw power and mesh it with the cool, complex precision of Maya’s groove. Her playing became more focused, her concentration absolute. She was the fulcrum on which their delicate balance rested.

The sound they made was undeniably better. It was fuller, more dynamic, and had a weight that pinned the audience to their seats. The applause at the end of their set was louder than ever, the calls for "more" more insistent. But the moment the last chord faded, the truce dissolved. Backstage – which was really just a cramped, dusty corridor behind the toilets piled high with empty kegs – the silence was thick and hostile. Gaz would immediately pack up his guitar, throwing cables into a bag with aggressive, jerky movements, his face a thundercloud. Maya would retreat into her own calm, self-contained bubble, wiping down her fretboard with meticulous care, her expression serene and unbothered. There were no post-gig debriefs, no celebratory drinks. The three of them were colleagues in a shared sonic enterprise, but they were not friends. They were a problem that only found its solution for forty-five minutes every Tuesday night.

At home, the cold war with Val had entered a new, more insidious phase. Val had abandoned the frontal assault of brochures and photo albums in favour of a campaign of strategic empathy. She started leaving articles about workplace stress and burnout on the kitchen table, casually mentioning therapies for repetitive strain injury, and asking with feigned concern if Sharon was “really getting enough sleep.” She was reframing the band not as a source of shame, but as a symptom of a deeper malaise, a cry for help from her overworked, confused daughter. It was a masterful, maddening tactic, and far harder to argue against than simple disapproval. Sharon found herself defending her joy as if it were a chronic illness, insisting that the exhaustion she felt after a gig was a good, clean ache, not the sign of an impending breakdown. The house, which had once been a simple, if beige, refuge from the leaks and blockages of the world, now felt like a psychological minefield.

Lucia, blissfully immune to the nuances of both band politics and domestic strife, was operating on a higher plane of strategic ambition. At their next "board meeting" in the afternoon gloom of The Anvil, she brandished a freshly printed poster. In bold letters it read: ‘THE ENGINE ROOM, BRIGHTON, PRESENTS: LIVE FROM PORTSMOUTH – GAZ, SHAZ & MAYA’. Underneath, in smaller print, was a date, four weeks away. Gaz stared at it as if it were a venomous snake. “We don’t have a name,” he grunted, seizing on the most obvious flaw. Lucia smiled, undeterred. “A temporary branding solution. Direct. To the point. Like a good plumbing invoice.” She turned to Sharon and Maya. “But he has a point. A proper band needs a proper name. And more importantly, a proper set list. Brighton is a thirty-minute slot. That’s seven songs. We have four, and three of them are the same.”

The attempt to write a new song was a disaster. They convened for a rare weekend rehearsal in a dingy, soundproofed room Lucia had rented by the hour above a kebab shop. The air was thick with the ghost of a thousand struggling bands and the lingering aroma of garlic sauce. Gaz had a riff, a fast, aggressive, repetitive phrase that sounded like an angry wasp trapped in a jar. He played it over and over, expecting them to fall in behind him. But the riff had no groove, no space. It was a closed loop. Sharon tried to find a beat that worked, but everything she played sounded clumsy and forced. Maya stood listening for a full five minutes, her bass silent, her expression one of polite disinterest. “There’s nowhere to go with that,” she finally said, her calm voice cutting through the noise. “It’s harmonically static. It doesn’t ask a question, so there can’t be an answer.” Gaz stopped playing, his face darkening. “It’s a riff. It’s not supposed to be a bloody philosophy seminar. It’s supposed to make you want to move.” “I don’t feel moved,” Maya replied flatly. “I feel trapped in a lift with a malfunctioning alarm bell.” The two of them stared each other down, the kebab shop-scented air crackling with animosity. The Brighton gig felt less like a possibility and more like a cruel joke.

Frustration, sharp and hot, boiled up inside Sharon. She was sick of their bickering, of the stalemate between Gaz’s raw emotion and Maya’s cool intellect. She was tired of being the mediator, the peacekeeper. Without thinking, she brought her sticks down on the kit, not in a beat, but in a furious, rhythmic outburst. It was a rhythm she knew intimately, the sound of her job. It was the rhythm of a seized valve on a water main, the stubborn, percussive *thwack-thwack-thwack* of a heavy wrench striking metal, followed by the deep, groaning *boooom* as the valve finally, grudgingly, began to turn. *THWACK-thwack-thwack. BOOOOM.* She played it again, the kick drum a resonant, gut-punching groan, the snare a series of sharp, metallic cracks. It was a heavy, lopsided, industrial rhythm, full of effort and resistance and eventual, brutal release. It was the sound of a problem being physically, violently solved.

The effect was instantaneous. Gaz and Maya both stopped arguing and stared at her. The rhythm was hypnotic, powerful, and utterly unique. It had a primal, lurching groove that was impossible to ignore. Maya was the first to react. A slow smile, the first one Sharon had ever seen, spread across her face. “Now that,” she said, her voice full of a new, excited energy, “is a question.” Her fingers found the fretboard, and she began to play, not a complex run, but a single, deep, distorted note that matched the groan of Sharon’s kick drum, holding it, letting it swell and feedback. It was a monstrous, beautiful sound. Gaz watched them, his expression confused, but his musical instincts took over. His own riff forgotten, he brought a hand down on his strings, muting them, and began to play a choppy, percussive rhythm that matched the sharp cracks of Sharon’s snare. *Chka-chka-chka. BOOOOM.* The three of them locked in, the angry wasp forgotten, replaced by this strange, powerful, lurching beast of a sound they were creating together. It wasn’t the blues. It wasn’t jazz. It was the sound of a burst pipe in Southsea, the smell of futility in a spare room, and the satisfying crack of a problem being solved, all rolled into one. It was their sound. Lucia, who had been watching from a corner, her face a mask of despair, slowly stood up, a look of pure, unadulterated awe dawning in her eyes. This wasn’t a philosophy seminar. This was an exorcism.The final, lurching boom of the kick drum echoed in the small, insulated room, and then there was silence. It was a new kind of silence, not the hostile, resentful quiet that had followed their arguments, but a stunned, electric stillness, thick with ozone and disbelief. They all stood frozen for a beat, breathing heavily, looking at each other as if seeing strangers. The ghost of the rhythm still pulsed in the air, a strange, limping, powerful heartbeat. Sharon’s arms trembled, not from fatigue, but from the raw adrenaline of her outburst. She had not just played a beat; she had spoken, and for the first time, everyone had been forced to listen.

Lucia was the first to move, rising from her corner like a director who had just witnessed the perfect, unscripted take. Her usual bright, conspiratorial expression was gone, replaced by a look of sheer, unadulterated awe. "Holy mother," she breathed, her voice a reverent whisper that was somehow louder than the silence. She took a step forward, her eyes wide. "That. What you just did. That wasn't a song. That was an industrial accident. A beautiful, glorious, magnificent industrial accident. That is our sound. That’s the song we open with in Brighton."

Maya, who had looked merely interested before, now looked alive. Her usual mask of cool detachment had cracked, and her eyes were bright with an intellectual excitement that was more intense than any amount of shouting. She turned to Sharon, ignoring Gaz completely. "That rhythm," she said, her voice low and urgent. "The displacement. It’s a seven-eight bar followed by a four-four. It shouldn't work, but it does. It has its own gravity. Where did it come from?" Sharon felt a flush creep up her neck. She looked down at her sticks, then back at the two women staring at her. "A burst water main," she said, the words sounding absurd even to her. "Under the Commercial Road roundabout last winter. The valve was seized. It took two of us with a four-foot wrench. It was the sound it made. The wrench striking the casing, and then the groan as it finally started to give."

Gaz made a noise in his throat, a guttural sound of pure confusion. "We can't play a burst water main," he said, the protest sounding weak and ridiculous in the face of the undeniable power of what they had just created. "It's not music. It's… plumbing." Maya finally turned her gaze on him, her new-found smile sharp and dangerous. "Everything is music, Gaz," she said, a clear challenge in her voice. "You just haven't been listening properly. That beat has more truth in it than a thousand recycled twelve-bar blues about your train leaving the station. That's the sound of work. Of resistance. It’s the most honest thing I’ve heard all year."

The weeks leading up to the Brighton gig were a frantic, chaotic blur of creation. The rehearsal room above the kebab shop became their laboratory. The "Burst Pipe" song, as it was provisionally known, became the template. It was their Rosetta Stone, the key that unlocked a new way of working together. The old battle lines between Gaz's raw tradition and Maya's cool theory began to blur. Now, when Gaz brought a riff, it was less a statement and more a suggestion. He would play a jagged, bluesy phrase, and Maya, instead of dismissing it, would find a strange, discordant harmony to underpin it, forcing the melody into a new and unsettling shape. They would both then turn to Sharon, waiting for her to provide the rhythmic context, the physical logic that would either make it stand up or fall apart. She was no longer the anchor; she was the architect. She would listen, her eyes closed, and then find a beat, sometimes lurching and industrial, sometimes as steady and relentless as a persistent drip, that gave the disparate parts a cohesive, compelling whole.

They managed to hammer out two more original songs in this new, collaborative forge. One was built around a sludgy, menacing bassline from Maya that sounded like something lurking in the deep, which Gaz overlaid with weeping, slide-guitar notes that mimicked the cry of herring gulls over a stormy harbour. They called it 'Southsea Mud'. The other was a fast, frantic, punk-inflected piece born from the rhythm of a faulty boiler ignition, full of false starts and sudden, explosive bursts of noise. The process was messy, argumentative, and frequently descended into tense silences, but it was always, eventually, productive. They were building something, and the shared act of creation was a far stronger bond than their mutual appreciation for the blues had ever been. Even the thorny issue of a name found a resolution. After rejecting Lucia’s theatrical suggestions (‘The Portsmouth Dreadnoughts’) and Gaz’s grumpy ones (‘Grievous Bodily Harm’), it was Sharon who spoke up one night, wiping sweat from her forehead. "We're fixing things," she'd said. "Or we're breaking them. It's all just nuts and bolts and pressure. Let’s just call ourselves The Stopcocks." There was a pause, and then Maya had laughed, a rare, genuine bark of amusement. "It's ugly. It's unglamorous. It's perfect." Gaz just grunted, which was his version of enthusiastic agreement.

Sharon carried this new, creative energy home with her like a smuggled substance. It changed the way she walked, the way she spoke. She was no longer just a plumber who played the drums; she was a drummer who happened to be a plumber. The two identities were beginning to merge. One evening, she was sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for the kettle to boil and subconsciously tapping out the lurching seven-eight rhythm of 'Burst Pipe' with a teaspoon on the Formica tabletop. Val, who was arranging a bowl of plastic fruit with funereal precision, stopped and watched her, her face a mask of concern. "You've got a tremor in your hand, Sharon," she said, her voice laden with rehearsed sympathy. "You're overdoing it. All this rushing around. It's not good for your nerves." Sharon looked at the teaspoon, then at her mother. The old defensiveness was gone, replaced by a simple, unshakeable certainty. "It's not a tremor, Mam," she said, her voice calm and even. "It's our first single." Val stared at her, her mouth opening and closing silently. The concept of a 'single' was so alien, so firmly from the world of 'spectacles' and 'showbusiness', that she had no prepared response. She looked at her daughter, at the calloused hands that could now create not just a watertight seal but also a rhythm, and for the first time, the worry in her eyes was tinged with something that looked like fear. She was losing not just the argument, but the daughter she thought she knew.The day of the Brighton gig dawned grey and damp, a typical Portsmouth morning that seemed to dampen everything but Sharon's nerves. They were a live wire, fizzing just beneath her skin. She was up before the gulls began their squabbling, loading her kit into the back of her white Transit van. The familiar clatter of the cymbal bag landing next to a toolbox, the careful way she wedged the kick drum between a stack of copper piping and a spare toilet cistern; it was a physical manifestation of her two lives colliding. The van, her rolling kingdom of wrenches and washers, smelled of oil, solder flux, and the faint, metallic scent of her drums. It was the smell of her.

She went back inside for her jacket and sticks, her boots echoing in the quiet hall. Val was in the kitchen, already dressed, her back ramrod straight as she stood by the counter. She didn't turn around. For a moment, Sharon thought she was going to be met with a final, devastating wall of silence. But then Val turned, and in her hands was a tartan-patterned thermos flask and a square Tupperware box sealed with electrical tape—a classic dad-fix. “It’s a long drive,” Val said, her voice tight, avoiding eye contact. “And service station food is extortion. Chicken salad. I cut the crusts off.” She pushed the items across the Formica table towards Sharon. “Can’t have you fainting from hunger before your… spectacle.”

The word was still there, a tiny, deliberate barb. But the action, the thermos of tea, the sandwiches secured with a plumber’s ingenuity, was an act of undeniable, grudging love. It was a white flag, not of surrender, but of ceasefire. It acknowledged the journey without endorsing the destination. Sharon felt a lump form in her throat. She picked up the offerings, their weight solid and real in her hands. “Thanks, Mam,” she said, her voice thicker than she expected. Val just nodded at the sink, her shoulders stiff. It was enough.

The journey along the A27 was a study in contained chaos. Lucia, in the passenger seat, was a whirlwind of energy, cross-referencing a route on her phone with a printed-out A-to-Z of Brighton “for its retro authenticity,” and providing a running commentary on cloud formations. In the back, nestled between an amplifier and Sharon’s spare work overalls, sat Maya, utterly serene. She had noise-cancelling headphones on and was engrossed in a dense-looking book titled ‘The Psychophysics of Pitch Perception’. She was an island of calm in their sea of anxiety. And next to her, staring out the window at the monotonous blur of the South Downs, sat Gaz, a statue of stoic resentment, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. Sharon drove, her hands steady on the wheel. She was in her element, piloting the heavy, familiar vehicle, the disparate, difficult components of her band safely contained in the back. The van hummed along, a rolling microcosm of their entire enterprise: practical, noisy, and smelling faintly of compromise.

Brighton was an assault on the senses. After the stoic, bruised grey of Portsmouth, the vibrant, chaotic energy of the North Laine felt like landing on another planet. The people were younger, their clothes brighter, their haircuts more architectural. It was a world away from The Anvil & Hammer’s comfortable gloom. The Engine Room was tucked down a narrow, graffiti-covered alley, its black-painted frontage giving nothing away. It wasn’t a pub that happened to have music; it was a dedicated venue, and the posters pasted on the wall were for bands with record deals and tour buses. Sharon parked the van, and for a moment, they all just sat in silence, staring at the intimidating black door. They were a long way from home.

The soundcheck was a humbling experience. The inside of the venue was a dark, cavernous space, the stage high above a sticky, beer-blackened floor. The PA system loomed on either side of the stage like a pair of malevolent robots. A sound engineer with a bored expression and a constellation of facial piercings put them through their paces, his voice a disembodied, critical drawl from the back of the room. At first, their sound felt thin and lost in the big space. Gaz’s amp, which roared like a lion in The Anvil, hummed with an electronic buzz he couldn’t seem to fix. But then the engineer asked Sharon for the kick and snare, and she laid into the opening beat of ‘Burst Pipe’. The effect was seismic. The sound that boomed back at them from the huge speakers was monstrous, a physical punch to the chest. The lurching, seven-eight rhythm filled every corner of the room with its unique, industrial power. From the darkness at the back of the room, the engineer’s voice came over the talkback, stripped of its boredom. “Right,” he said, a new note of interest in his tone. “That’s a bit different. Let’s hear that one again.”

The two hours between soundcheck and their stage time crawled by. They were shown to a dressing room that was little more than a concrete cell, furnished with a stained sofa and a mirror surrounded by bulbs, half of which were blown. The air was cold and smelled of damp and stale cigarette smoke. This was the unglamorous reality of being the opening act. Gaz paced the small room like a caged bear. Maya sat cross-legged on the floor, performing a series of intricate finger-stretching exercises. Lucia, ever the manager, tried to boost morale by reading out glowing comments from The Anvil’s Facebook page, her voice artificially bright in the grim little room. Sharon sat on a flight case, her sticks in her hand, tapping a silent, frantic paradiddle against her work trousers. The adrenaline was building, a tide rising inside her, and she was terrified it would crest too soon, leaving her washed out and shaky when she needed it most.

Lucia, who had slipped out to “run reconnaissance,” burst back into the room, her eyes wide with a mixture of terror and glee. “It’s busy,” she whispered, as if the crowd might hear her. “It’s not pub-busy. It’s proper-venue-busy. It’s sold out. For the headline act, obviously,” she added quickly, “but they’re all in there.” The muffled roar of hundreds of conversations seeped through the concrete walls, a vast, anonymous presence. Just then, the door creaked open and a man with a clipboard and a headset stuck his head in. “The Stopcocks?” he asked, the name sounding jarringly official under the fluorescent light. “Five minutes.” He vanished. The roar from outside seemed to get louder. Gaz stopped pacing. Maya stood up, brushing down her black jeans. The three of them stood in the centre of the small room, caught in a triangle of shared dread and anticipation. Gaz cleared his throat, a sound like rocks grinding together. He looked at Sharon, then at Maya, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. “Right then,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “Let’s give ‘em some plumbing.” It was the closest he had ever come to a joke. Sharon’s lips twitched into a smile. She gripped her sticks, the worn hickory smooth and familiar in her sweating palms. It was time to go to work.The walk from the concrete cell to the side of the stage was the longest fifty feet of Sharon’s life. It was a journey through a narrow, dark artery of the building, the walls vibrating with a low, bassy hum from the support act’s DJ who was warming up the crowd. The muffled roar of hundreds of voices grew with every step, a sound that wasn’t just heard but felt, a pressure on her skin, in her chest. Gaz walked ahead of her, his shoulders set like a man heading to his own execution. Behind her, Maya was a shadow of calm, her only concession to the moment a slight quickening of her pace. Lucia met them at the curtained entrance to the stage, her face pale but her eyes blazing with fierce, manic encouragement. She grabbed Sharon’s arm, her grip tight. “Don’t think. Just hit,” she commanded, her voice a low, urgent hiss. “Show them where you’re from.” Then she pushed Sharon forward, into the blinding darkness.

Stepping out onto the stage was like diving into a hot, black ocean. The heat from the lights was a physical blow, sucking the air from her lungs. Beyond the glare, the audience was a vast, restless darkness, a monstrous, many-headed creature that coughed and murmured and shifted in the gloom. It was an anonymous, terrifying void, stretching back further than she could see. She felt a wave of vertigo so powerful her knees almost buckled. For a heart-stopping second, she forgot how to breathe, how to move. Then her eyes found the drum kit, bathed in a single blue light. It was her raft. Her one, solid piece of reality in this overwhelming sensory chaos. She navigated her way to it, her movements stiff and robotic, and sat down on the stool. The familiar vinyl, the specific angle of the cymbals, the weight of the sticks in her hands—it was an anchor, and she clung to it with every fibre of her being.

Gaz took his position, a stoic silhouette against the glare, and Maya stood to her right, a cool, dark pillar of stillness. No one spoke. There was no count-in. They had rehearsed this transition a hundred times in the kebab-scented room. Gaz looked at her, a quick, sharp nod. That was it. That was the signal. This was her moment. The murmuring of the crowd swelled, laced with a thread of impatient curiosity. Sharon closed her eyes, took a deep, shuddering breath, and shut out the void in front of her. She thought of the cold mud under the Commercial Road roundabout, the groan of rusted metal, the brute force of the four-foot wrench. She brought her right foot down on the kick drum pedal.

The sound that erupted from the PA was not a musical note. It was a geological event. A deep, gut-wrenching BOOM that shook the entire building, a sound so profound it felt like the venue’s own heart had just stuttered into a new, lurching rhythm. A ripple of startled silence passed through the audience. Sharon didn’t wait. She brought the sticks down in the sharp, three-crack salvo on the snare. *THWACK-thwack-thwack.* It was the sound of a wrench on steel, amplified into a gunshot report. The lopsided, seven-eight rhythm slammed into the room, a physical challenge. Then Maya came in, her bass a deep, distorted groan that wrapped around the kick drum, and Gaz’s guitar added its choppy, percussive scratching. The industrial accident was born, live and screaming, in a sold-out room in Brighton.

For the first minute, the audience didn’t know what to do. The rhythm was all wrong, fighting against every instinct to clap along or nod in a regular four-four time. People shifted uncomfortably. Sharon could feel their resistance, a collective wave of confusion and skepticism. She ignored it. She closed her eyes and focused on the nexus of sound they were creating on stage. She wasn't playing the drums anymore; she was operating a vast, complex piece of machinery. The kick was a piston, the snare a pneumatic hammer, her hi-hat the hiss of escaping steam. She drove the beat forward with a relentless, mechanical force, her body locked into the powerful, ugly groove. She felt Gaz dig in beside her, his choppy riff becoming more aggressive. She felt Maya’s bassline become a deep, malevolent throb that resonated through the stage and up her spine. They were a single, functioning unit, a three-headed machine built of noise and frustration and defiance.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, something in the room began to shift. The audience’s resistance broke. They couldn't dance to it, they couldn't sing to it, but they couldn't ignore it. In the front rows, heads began to move, not nodding, but jerking, compelled by the sheer gravitational pull of the lopsided beat. The confusion on their faces was replaced by a look of intense, mesmerised concentration. They had been given a problem, a rhythmic puzzle, and their bodies were trying to solve it. By the time the song crashed to its shuddering, grinding halt, the entire room was locked in with them. In the split-second of silence that followed, Sharon heard a single voice from the crowd yell a raw, exultant “YES!” before the room exploded into a roar of applause and confused, excited cheers. It was the sound of a thousand people having their expectations completely dismantled.

They didn't give the crowd a chance to recover. Sharon counted off four heavy beats and they crashed straight into 'Southsea Mud'. The tempo dropped, and the mood became thick and menacing. Maya’s bassline was the star here, a sludgy, prowling thing that moved with a predatory grace, while Gaz’s slide guitar wept and howled over the top like a banshee on the wind. Sharon’s beat was sparse and heavy, the kick and snare separated by vast oceans of space, each hit landing with the finality of a spade digging into wet earth. This, the audience understood. This was a recognizable, if darker, shade of the blues. It drew them in, and after the shock of the opening number, they went willingly. Sharon chanced a look out past the lights and saw a sea of bodies swaying in time, a field of corn moving in a slow, heavy wind. She saw a young woman in the third row, her eyes closed, her face a picture of serene focus as she moved to the rhythm, completely lost in the sound. The vast, anonymous monster had a face now. It was listening. It understood.

The thirty-minute set felt like it lasted for five minutes and a hundred years. They finished with the frantic, explosive energy of their boiler-ignition song, a final, two-minute blast of punk-rock fury that left them breathless and drenched in sweat. Sharon brought her sticks and foot down for the final, chaotic crash, holding the cymbal to choke its ring, and the sound cut out into an abrupt, absolute silence. The only noise was the hum of the amplifiers and the ragged sound of her own breathing in her ears. For a second, there was nothing. Just the ringing in her ears and the heat of the lights. Then, the darkness in front of them erupted. It was a solid wall of noise, a physical wave of sound that hit the stage and washed over them. It was bigger than any sound they had made, a roar of pure, unadulterated energy that went on and on. Sharon looked at Maya, who had a single drop of sweat tracing a line down her temple, a small, genuine smile on her lips. She looked at Gaz, who was leaning on his amp, his head bowed, but his shoulders were shaking with what looked like silent, exhausted laughter. They had done it. They had walked into a strange city, into a room full of strangers, armed with nothing but their strange, ugly, honest noise, and they had conquered it. Standing there, bathed in the roar of the crowd and the heat of the stage lights, Sharon felt a profound, tectonic shift inside her. The plumber, the daughter, the quiet woman from the terraced house in Old Portsmouth, had been burned away. All that was left was the drummer.The walk back to the dressing room was a disorienting, dreamlike stagger through the vibrating corridors of the venue. The roar of the crowd faded behind them, replaced by the high-pitched whine of tinnitus and the heavy, rhythmic thud of their own blood in their ears. They didn’t speak. There was nothing to say. They stumbled into the cold concrete cell and collapsed onto the stained sofa, a heap of sweat, denim, and exhausted adrenaline. Gaz slumped into a corner, his head in his hands, not in despair but in sheer, overwhelming exhaustion. Maya leaned against the wall, her eyes closed, her usual serene composure replaced by a visible tremor in her hands. Sharon just sat, her arms hanging limply at her sides, staring at the scuffed floor, trying to process the wave that had just broken over them and receded, leaving them stranded and shaking on the shore. The hostile silence of their previous post-gig encounters was gone; this was a shared, breathless depletion, a collective emptiness that was more intimate than any conversation.

The door flew open, slamming against the concrete wall and making them all flinch. Lucia stood silhouetted in the doorway, her face a mask of ecstatic, tear-streaked glory. She looked like she had personally witnessed a miracle. "You absolute magnificent bastards," she breathed, her voice trembling. "You didn't just play a gig. You started a cult. They were terrified. They were mesmerised. They didn't know whether to run away or propose marriage." She lunged forward, enveloping Sharon in a hug that smelled of victory and other people’s vape smoke. Before she could launch into a full strategic debrief, a new figure appeared at the door. It was the sound engineer, the man with the piercings and the bored expression. His expression was no longer bored. He looked at them with a kind of baffled respect, like a bomb disposal expert examining a device he had never seen before. "Right," he said, directing his words to the room at large. "That was… something. The seven-eight thing is mental. Who’s your manager?" Lucia detached herself from Sharon and straightened up, her entire demeanour shifting in an instant from ecstatic fan to sharp-suited professional. "I am," she said, her voice crisp. The engineer nodded, pulling a pen from behind his ear. "I do some A&R scouting for a small indie label. They’d be interested. Can I get a contact?" Lucia produced a business card from her jacket pocket with a flourish, as if she had been waiting for this exact moment her entire life. It was a card Sharon had never seen before, glossy and black, with ‘The Stopcocks - Management’ printed in severe white lettering.

The hours that followed were a surreal anticlimax. After the high of the performance and the dizzying promise of a record label’s interest, they were faced with the brute reality of the load-out. Under the harsh, unforgiving house lights of the now-empty venue, they hauled their own gear back through the deserted corridors and out into the cold, damp Brighton night. Sharon’s Transit van, parked under the jaundiced glow of a streetlamp, looked mundane and reassuringly normal. The process of loading the drums, the amps, the guitars, was a familiar, grounding ritual. Every thud of a flight case, every clatter of a cymbal stand, brought them further back down to earth. By the time the last piece of equipment was packed away and the van doors slammed shut, the triumphant rock stars who had left the stage had vanished, replaced by three tired musicians and their even more tired roadie-slash-manager, facing a two-hour drive home.

The journey back along the dark, empty motorway was quiet, but it was a comfortable, living silence. The pre-gig tension had been discharged, leaving a clean, calm exhaustion in its wake. Gaz wasn't staring resentfully out of the window; he was slumped against it, fast asleep, a low snore rumbling from his beard. Maya, headphones off, was looking at the dark shapes of the passing trees, a faint, contemplative smile on her face. Lucia had finally run out of words, her strategic notebook lying closed in her lap. Sharon drove, her hands steady on the wheel, the van’s familiar hum a soothing baseline. Halfway home, she pulled into a deserted service station. In the stark, fluorescent glare of the parking bay, she reached into the footwell and retrieved the Tupperware box and the tartan thermos. "Anyone for a sandwich?" she asked, her voice quiet in the sleeping van. Maya turned, her eyes curious. Sharon handed her a triangle of perfectly cut chicken salad on white bread. Maya took it, a look of surprise on her face. "Your mum?" she asked. Sharon nodded. Maya took a bite, then another, a small, genuine smile gracing her lips. "She cuts the crusts off. That's love." Sharon turned to the back. "Gaz?" He stirred, blinking groggily. She held out a sandwich. He looked at it, then at her, and wordlessly took it, cramming half of it into his mouth in one go. They sat there for ten minutes in the humming silence of the van, under the cold lights of a Sussex service station, sharing tea from a thermos and sandwiches secured with electrical tape. It felt more like a victory celebration than any champagne-soaked afterparty ever could.

Pulling into her own street in Old Portsmouth felt like surfacing from a deep dive. The world was utterly still, the terraced houses huddled together asleep under a sky that was just beginning to pale from black to a deep, bruised purple. The silence was absolute, a stark contrast to the roar that was still a faint echo in her ears. She dropped a sleeping Gaz off, then Maya, who gave her a quiet, "See you Tuesday," that sounded more like a promise than a plan. Finally, she was alone, parked outside her own front door. The house was dark, save for the single lamp left on in the living room. It looked exactly the same. But as she walked towards it, her key in her hand, she knew that something had fundamentally changed. The house was no longer the sole arbiter of her reality. It was just a place she lived, a place she returned to. Her real life, the one that was loud and difficult and true, was something she now carried around inside her.

She pushed the door open as quietly as she could, her work boots feeling unnaturally loud on the floorboards. As she had expected, Val was there, sitting in her armchair, a blanket over her knees. The thermos and the empty Tupperware box sat on the coffee table beside her, a silent testament to her vigil. Sharon braced herself for the questions, the quiet recriminations, the expressions of concern. She was too tired to fight, too full of a strange, calm certainty to be defensive. She just stood in the doorway, waiting. Val looked up, her face etched with the weariness of a long night’s worry. She looked at Sharon’s exhausted face, at the smudged mascara under her eyes, at the way she stood, no longer coiled with defiance, but simply, solidly, present. The question Val asked was not the one Sharon had been expecting. There was no accusation in it, no passive aggression. It was a simple, quiet, and utterly disarming request for information. "Well?" she asked, her voice raspy with sleep. "How was it?" Sharon walked into the room and sank onto the sofa. She thought of the roaring crowd, the lurching power of their music, the moment of communion in the service station car park. She looked at her mother, at the woman who had spent a lifetime trying to protect her from the noise, and gave her the only answer that mattered. "It was good, Mam," she said, her voice clear and steady. "It was really good." She leaned over and picked up the thermos. "Thanks for the tea." Val just watched her, her gaze searching her daughter's face. She saw no hint of the frantic, angry girl who had railed against her world. She saw a woman, exhausted and calm, who had travelled somewhere far away and come back whole. A tiny, almost imperceptible nod was her only reply. The war was over. Neither of them had won. The ground had simply shifted beneath their feet.The day after Brighton, Sharon found herself on her back on a damp kitchen floor in Hilsea, staring up at the complex, leaking guts of a dishwasher. The air smelled of sour, stagnant water and the faint, chemical tang of rinse aid. A rhythmic, melancholy *plink… plonk… plink…* of water dripped from a failed seal into the roasting tin the owner had placed beneath it. A week ago, she would have heard it as just another problem to be solved, another entry for the invoice. Today, she heard a syncopated beat. The *plink* was a closed hi-hat, slightly behind the beat. The deeper *plonk* was a ghost note on the snare. She found herself mentally adding a slow, heavy kick drum, building a mournful, minimalist groove around the sound of the leak. Her job hadn’t changed, but her perception of it had been fundamentally rewired. The world was no longer just a series of things to be fixed; it was a vast, untapped source of rhythmic ideas.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, vibrating against the cold lino. She slid out from under the counter, wiping a smear of grime from her cheek with the back of her hand, and answered. It was Lucia. “Shaz! Are you sitting down? Don’t. Stand up. This is standing-up news,” Lucia’s voice crackled down the line, a firework display of pure excitement. “I’ve been on the phone with Simon—our man from The Engine Room, Pierced-Nose-Pete as he shall forever be known in our hearts—and he’s spoken to the head of A&R at Amalgamated Records. They’re not just interested, they’re *intrigued*. They want a meeting. A proper, sit-down-in-an-office-with-bad-coffee-and-uncomfortable-chairs meeting. Next Friday.”

Sharon sank back down onto the floor, the damp seeping through the back of her overalls. A meeting. With a record label. The words sounded like they belonged to someone else’s life. They were concepts from films and magazines, not something that happened to a plumber from Portsmouth. The dripping from the dishwasher suddenly sounded frantic and mocking. “Next Friday?” she managed, her voice a reedy whisper. “Lucia, that’s nine days away. What are we supposed to do in a meeting with a record label?” There was a brief pause, and Sharon could almost hear the click of Lucia’s brain shifting from excited fan to serious manager. “We are going to walk in there,” she said, her voice now low and focused, “and we are going to present them with a plan. A brand. A set of demos. And we are going to walk out with a development deal. Rehearsal tomorrow night. Kebab-land. Eight o’clock sharp. Tell the boys to bring their A-game. Phase three has just begun.” The line went dead, leaving Sharon in the quiet kitchen with only the sound of the drip and the frantic hammering of her own heart.

The mood in the rehearsal room the next evening was thick with a new, unfamiliar tension. It wasn’t the old hostility; it was the heavy, suffocating pressure of a shared opportunity. Lucia laid out the situation with the aid of a whiteboard she had brought with her, drawing flow-charts and diagrams that connected ‘The Stopcocks’ to ‘Global Domination’ via a series of alarmingly ambitious steps. Gaz listened with his arms folded, his expression one of profound, ingrained skepticism. “A record label,” he grunted, as if the words left a bad taste in his mouth. “Right. And they heard our lopsided noise about a burst pipe and thought, ‘That’s the next big thing’? They’ll want to smooth us out. They’ll bring in a producer who wants more choruses and less seven-eight time signatures. They’ll try and make us sound like everyone else.”

Maya, who had been methodically tuning her bass, looked up. “He’s not wrong,” she said, her calm pragmatism a cold splash of water on Lucia’s bonfire of ambition. “Their interest is a data point, nothing more. To proceed, they will require a product. We don’t have one. We have a live set. We need a demo. A clean, professionally recorded demonstration of our sound. The recordings from my phone will not be sufficient.” The demo. The word hung in the air. A demo meant a recording studio. A studio meant money, something they had in even shorter supply than they had songs. Sharon felt a familiar, sinking feeling, the same feeling she got when quoting a customer for a full boiler replacement. “How much does a studio cost?” she asked, already knowing the answer would be more than they could afford. Lucia’s bright expression faltered for the first time. “It’s… not insignificant,” she admitted. “But it’s an investment! We can pool our resources…” She looked around the room. Sharon had her van lease and her mum’s mortgage. Gaz lived in a rented room and seemed to subsist entirely on beer and righteous indignation. Maya’s financial situation was a complete mystery, but she didn’t look like she was sitting on a pile of disposable income. The glorious, world-conquering future Lucia had mapped out on the whiteboard was about to be defeated by a simple lack of cash.

Sharon drove home that night with the problem turning over and over in her head, a heavy, intractable piece of machinery. The conversation with her mum, which she had been dreading, now felt like a secondary concern. She walked into the quiet house, the smell of furniture polish and brewing chamomile tea a comforting, familiar blanket. Val was in the living room, watching a documentary about endangered turtles, a mug cradled in her hands. Sharon stood in the doorway for a long moment, gathering her thoughts. “Mam,” she said, her voice making Val jump. “Can I talk to you for a second?” Val muted the television, her expression wary. The truce was holding, but it was untested. “The gig in Brighton,” Sharon began, choosing her words carefully. “It went very well. So well, in fact, that a record label… one of the companies that makes CDs and things… wants to have a meeting with us.”

Val stared at her, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to process the information. “A record company?” she repeated slowly. “Like… like EMI? The ones who did The Beatles?” Sharon gave a small, wry smile. “Not quite that big, Mam. A small one. An indie label.” Val’s gaze became distant. She was trying to fit this new, impossible piece of information into her worldview, and it wouldn’t go. “And what does that mean?” she finally asked, her voice quiet. “A meeting. Does that mean you’re… going to be on the television?” “I don’t know, Mam. Probably not. It’s just a first step.” Val fell silent, her hands tightening around her mug. Sharon could see the fear in her eyes, clear as day. It wasn’t about spectacle or embarrassment anymore. It was simpler, and deeper. “Does that mean you’d have to move away?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper. “To London?” There it was. The heart of it all. The fear of being left behind. Sharon crossed the room and sat on the arm of her mother’s chair. “No, Mam,” she said softly, putting a hand on her mother’s shoulder. “Even if anything came of it, which it probably won’t, we’re a Portsmouth band. Our sound is… it’s from here. It wouldn’t work anywhere else.” She looked around the quiet, safe room, at the commemorative plates and the faded floral patterns. “I’m not going anywhere.” Val looked up at her, a long, searching gaze, and then she gave a small, shaky nod. The fear hadn’t gone, but it had been answered.

Later, lying in bed, the problem of the demo still churning in her mind, Sharon had an idea. It began as a flicker and grew into a blazing certainty. A studio. Gaz was right, they’d try to clean them up. Maya was right, they needed a professional recording. But maybe they were both thinking about it the wrong way. Their sound wasn’t clean. It wasn’t meant to be. It was born of industry and decay, of rust and pressure. Putting it in a sterile, soundproofed room felt like putting a wild animal in a cage. You wouldn't be capturing its essence; you’d just be recording its unhappiness. The next morning, she called Lucia. “I’ve got it,” she said, without preamble. “The studio. I know where we can record.” “Shaz, that’s brilliant! Is it cheap?” Lucia asked, ever the pragmatist. “It’s free,” Sharon replied, a grin spreading across her face. “It’s about twenty minutes from here. It’s got amazing natural reverb, it’s full of metal and concrete, and it’s completely soundproofed.” “My god, where is it?” Lucia demanded, her voice full of excitement. Sharon looked out of her window, towards the naval base, the idea so perfect, so audacious, she almost laughed out loud. “It’s one of the old Napoleonic-era gunpowder magazines at Priddy’s Hard,” she said. “My friend’s dad is the curator. It’s a brick-lined dome. An arsenal. It’s basically a giant underground drum. It’ll sound immense.”Convincing the band that recording their demo in a two-hundred-year-old gunpowder storage facility was a good idea proved to be as difficult as tuning a drum in a hurricane. They were gathered in the kebab-scented rehearsal room, the whiteboard from the previous week still bearing the faint, ghostly traces of Lucia’s grand plans. Sharon laid out her proposal, her voice steady and clear, trying to project a confidence she only partially felt. The reactions were immediate and perfectly in character. Lucia’s eyes lit up with a terrifying, theatrical fire. “Oh, my god,” she breathed, her hands clasped together as if in prayer. “The symbolism. The narrative. A band called The Stopcocks, recording in a sealed, high-pressure environment built to contain explosions. It’s not just a demo, it’s a mission statement! The album art designs itself!”

Maya, ever the scientist, was intrigued by the physics. She leaned forward, her sharp features focused. “A brick-lined parabolic dome?” she queried, her voice low and analytical. “What’s the ceiling height? It could create a unique standing wave. The natural reverb could be extraordinary, but it could also be a muddy, uncontrollable mess. We would need to do a full acoustic survey.” Gaz, however, looked at Sharon as if she had just suggested they record their demo at the bottom of the harbour. “Are you out of your mind?” he snarled, his voice a low growl of disbelief. “A damp brick hole. There’ll be no power, it’ll be colder than a landlord’s heart, and my guitar will rust before we even get through the first take. We’re a band, not a team of urban explorers. We need a studio. With walls that don’t leak and a kettle that works.”

Sharon had anticipated his objections. She had spent the previous night lying awake, running the logistics through her head with the same methodical focus she would apply to a complex plumbing schematic. This was her plan, and she would defend it. “There’s a caretaker’s circuit for inspection lamps,” she stated, her tone practical and direct. “It won’t be enough to power the amps, but I can borrow a portable generator from work for those. We’ll need a long extension lead. The damp is a problem, but it’s a constant, not a variable. We can work with it. As for the kettle,” she added, a small, wry smile touching her lips, “I have a thermos.” She looked directly at Gaz, meeting his grumpy stare without flinching. She wasn’t just the drummer anymore, a passenger in Lucia’s ambitious vehicle. She was the one with the map.

Getting permission proved to be surprisingly easy. The curator of the Priddy’s Hard museum, Arthur Spivey, was a friend of Sharon’s late father, a man who shared her dad’s love for the nuts and bolts of history. His office was a small, chaotic room overflowing with books, maritime charts, and half-disassembled pieces of naval hardware. He was a small, spry man in his seventies with a wild shock of white hair and oil permanently ingrained in the cracks of his knuckles. When Sharon, with Lucia providing dramatic color commentary, explained their plan, he didn’t laugh or dismiss them. He leaned back in his creaking chair, his eyes twinkling with delight. “The Grand Magazine?” he mused, steepling his fingers. “Haven’t had anyone in there making a racket since the Royal Marines band practiced their Christmas carols in ‘83. Nearly took the roof off with ‘Good King Wenceslas’.” He looked from Lucia’s vibrant, pleading face to Sharon’s earnest, practical one. “Your dad, he’d have liked this. The sheer bloody-mindedness of it. Using a piece of military history for something new. I like it. It’s got spirit.” He handed her a large, cartoonishly oversized iron key. “Don’t break anything, don’t set anything on fire, and be out by five. The ghosts get restless after dark.”

Their reconnaissance mission took place on a windswept Thursday afternoon. The Priddy’s Hard site was a strange, forgotten corner of Gosport, a peninsula of land bristling with the architectural remnants of Britain’s naval might. They walked past decommissioned cannons, along grassy ramparts overlooking the grey, choppy water of Portsmouth Harbour, the modern spire of the Spinnaker Tower a futuristic needle on the horizon. The gunpowder magazines themselves were not grand buildings, but low, ominous mounds covered in thick grass, their arched brick entrances like mouths leading into the earth. Arthur led them to the largest one, unlocked a heavy wooden door with the iron key, and swung it open, revealing a short, dark tunnel. “Mind your heads,” he said cheerfully, and then left them to it.

The moment they stepped from the bright, windy daylight into the tunnel, the world changed. The temperature dropped by ten degrees, and the air became thick, still, and cold, smelling of damp earth, old brick, and something else, a faint, sharp scent that might have been the ghost of saltpetre. The tunnel opened out into a vast, circular chamber, its domed brick ceiling soaring thirty feet above them, disappearing into shadow. A single, low-wattage bulb, part of the caretaker’s circuit, cast a weak, golden light, creating a small island of visibility in a vast ocean of darkness. Their footsteps, which had been silent on the grass outside, now echoed with an unnatural clarity, every scuff and shuffle amplified into a significant event. The silence in the space was profound, a living presence that seemed to press in on them.

Maya, her eyes wide with a mixture of scientific curiosity and wonder, broke the silence first. She stood in the exact centre of the dome, took a breath, and clapped her hands together once. The sound was not an echo. It was a bloom. The sharp, dry clap instantly expanded into a huge, warm, resonant tone that hung in the cold air for a full five seconds before slowly, gracefully, decaying back into silence. It was a sound so beautiful and so pure that it made the hairs on Sharon’s arms stand on end. Lucia let out a low whistle of appreciation. “Oh, yes,” she whispered, her voice barely disturbing the quiet. “This is the place.” Maya, without a word, unslung her bass, and though it was unplugged, she plucked a single, low E. The note didn't just sound; it manifested. It filled the dome, the brickwork seeming to catch it and amplify it, turning the single string vibration into a spectral, organ-like tone that vibrated in their bones.

Even Gaz was momentarily stunned into silence by the sheer sonic magnificence of the space. The moment passed quickly, however, replaced by his ingrained pragmatism. “It’s freezing,” he grumbled, pulling his denim jacket tighter around himself. “And it smells of old death. We’ll last an hour before we all get pneumonia.” To prove his point, he sang a single, mournful blues phrase, his voice sounding thin and reedy in the cold air. But then the dome caught it. The simple melody came back to him, harmonised and enriched, layered with its own ghostly reverb, turning his complaint into a piece of soaring, ethereal music. He stopped, his mouth slightly agape, listening to his own voice as he had never heard it before. He looked around the vast, dark space, at the endless, intricate patterns of the brickwork, then back at the others. The fight had gone out of his eyes, replaced by a look of dawning, reluctant wonder.

Lucia seized the moment of stunned consensus. “Right,” she declared, her voice full of renewed purpose, making them all jump. “It’s settled. We do it here. Saturday. We’ll need the generator, every extension lead in Portsmouth, a hell of a lot of tea, and probably some fingerless gloves for Gaz.” She looked around at the shadowy, cathedral-like space, a visionary gleam in her eye. “This isn’t just a demo. This is a field recording. We are capturing an environment. We are recording the sound of Portsmouth’s history.” The three band members stood together in the small pool of light, dwarfed by the immense, dark dome. The sheer, insane audacity of the plan settled over them. They were going to try and capture their fragile, noisy, modern sound in a place built for silence and war. It was a ridiculous, impossible, and utterly perfect idea.Saturday arrived, not grey and damp, but with a fierce, wind-scoured brilliance. The sky over Portsmouth was a hard, brittle blue, and a relentless northeasterly wind tore across the harbour, whipping the water into a frenzy of whitecaps. It was a wind that felt like it could strip the paint from a battleship, and it made the logistical challenge of their recording session feel even more heroic. Sharon’s Transit van, loaded to the gunwales with drums, amps, miles of cable, and a formidable-looking petrol generator she’d signed out from the works depot, served as their campaign headquarters. They looked less like a band and more like a team of specialist engineers preparing to decommission a nuclear facility. The load-in was a brutal, wind-lashed affair, a punishing series of trips from the van, across the grassy ramparts, to the mouth of the Grand Magazine, each member bent double against the gale, clutching a piece of precious, heavy equipment.

Once inside the dome, the contrast was absolute. The roaring wind was replaced by a profound, subterranean silence. The air was still and bitingly cold, carrying the damp, mineral scent of ancient brick. Sharon, in her element, took charge of the power. She ran a heavy-duty extension lead from the magazine’s entrance back out into the daylight, snaking it a full fifty yards across the rampart to where the generator sat, its noisy chugging thankfully rendered almost inaudible by the relentless wind. Inside the dome, she set up a distribution board, creating a small, modern island of multi-sockets and trip switches in the centre of the two-hundred-year-old space. It was a piece of practical magic, bringing light and power into the deep, historic darkness. Watching her work, taping down cables and checking voltages, Gaz grunted with what sounded like reluctant approval. “Right,” he said to Lucia. “At least one of us knows what they’re doing.”

Setting up the instruments was a slow, deliberate process, each action amplified by the extraordinary acoustics. The simple click of a cymbal stand being locked into place became a sharp, percussive event. Maya directed the placement of the microphones with the precision of a surgeon, treating the entire dome as a single, complex instrument. She placed one mic high up on a stand, pointing at the apex of the dome to capture the vast, blooming reverb, and another in the far corner to catch the long decay. She spent twenty minutes just tapping the snare drum while Sharon adjusted its position by inches, listening intently to the way the sound interacted with the room. “The early reflections are blurring the attack,” she murmured, more to herself than to anyone else. “We need to be tighter. Sharper. The room will provide the sustain.” For once, Gaz didn’t complain. He just watched, huddled in three layers of clothing and a pair of fingerless gloves, a flask of Sharon’s mother’s tea clutched in his hands, understanding that this was a problem beyond the scope of simple grumpiness.

Their first attempt to play was, as Maya had predicted, an uncontrollable mess. The moment they launched into ‘Southsea Mud’, the sound collapsed into a chaotic, echoing wave. Gaz’s guitar, which he had turned up to compensate for the cold, bounced off the brick walls, its delay pedal fighting with the dome’s natural five-second reverb to create a slurry of indistinct noise. Sharon’s drums, which she played with her usual live-gig force, sounded like a series of explosions in a cathedral, each cymbal crash a tidal wave of high-frequency hash that washed over everything. They ground to a halt after thirty seconds, the last, discordant chord hanging in the air for an eternity before decaying into a resentful silence. Gaz threw his hands up in disgust. “It’s a swimming pool!” he yelled, his voice echoing around them. “It’s a bloody sonic swimming pool! I told you this was a stupid idea. We sound like we’ve fallen down a well.”

The atmosphere in the cold dome plummeted. The initial excitement had evaporated, replaced by the damp chill of failure. Sharon felt a knot of dread tighten in her stomach. This was her plan, her grand idea, and it was falling apart into a muddy, echoing shambles. Lucia, sensing the impending mutiny, was about to launch into a morale-boosting speech, but Maya held up a hand to stop her. She walked to the centre of the room, her footsteps echoing. “He’s right,” she said calmly, nodding at Gaz. “We are fighting the room. We are trying to fill a space that is already full. We have to do the opposite.” She turned to Sharon. “Play your ‘Burst Pipe’ beat. But play it at half the volume you normally would. And every kick, every snare… leave a space around it. Don’t rush to the next hit. Let the dome have its say. Let it finish your sentence.”

It was a strange, counter-intuitive instruction: to gain power by playing quieter, to be heavier by being lighter. Sharon was skeptical, but she trusted Maya’s scientific certainty. She took a breath, relaxed her grip on the sticks, and began the lurching seven-eight rhythm. She focused on each individual hit, making it as clean and precise as possible, and then she waited, consciously listening to the vast, resonant bloom that followed each strike. She became a collaborator with the architecture. Maya came in, her bassline stripped back to its essential notes, each one placed perfectly in the space Sharon left, a deep, resonant pulse that supported the groove without crowding it. She looked at Gaz and nodded. “The fence posts, Gaz,” she said. “Just the fence posts.” Gaz hesitated, then with a sigh of resignation, he began to play the choppy, muted, percussive part of the song, his chords sharp, dry, and tight. Suddenly, it all locked into place. The sound was immense. The dome took their sparse, disciplined performance and magnified it, enriched it, gave it a grandeur and a sense of colossal scale they could never have achieved in a normal studio. The space between the notes became as important as the notes themselves, filled with the ghost of the dome’s reverb. They were no longer playing in a room; they were playing the room itself.

They ran through ‘Burst Pipe’ three times, each take becoming tighter, more confident, more powerful. They were no longer just a band, but a single entity fused with the ancient building, a strange, hybrid machine of brick, flesh, and electricity. Lucia, huddled over the small mixing desk and laptop they had set up, gave them a thumbs up, her face ecstatic. “We’ve got it,” she yelled, her voice almost lost in the final, decaying boom of Sharon’s kick drum. “It sounds like a blockbuster movie soundtrack. It sounds like God is angry about his plumbing.” She cued up the playback, and they gathered around, passing a single pair of high-quality headphones between them, a sacred ritual in the cold, dark dome. Sharon went last. She slipped the headphones on, the sudden silence of the outside world a shock, and then Lucia hit play.

The sound that flooded her ears was not them. It was a monumental, terrifying, and beautiful version of them. It was their ugly, industrial rhythm, their lurching, angry beat, transformed by the history and the physics of the space into something epic. The kick drum didn't just thump; it was a deep, resonant concussion that seemed to shake the very foundations of the world. The snare cracked like lightning striking an iron girder. Gaz’s guitar was a jagged shard of metal, and Maya’s bass was a deep, tectonic groan from the bowels of the earth. Above it all, a ghostly halo of reverb hung like mist, the voice of the building itself, a two-hundred-year-old witness to their noise. It was raw, imperfect, and utterly, undeniably them. It was the sound she had heard in her head, the sound she had been chasing all along. She pulled the headphones off, her face a mask of stunned disbelief. She looked at Maya, who was watching her, a rare, bright smile on her face. She looked at Gaz, who was staring at the brick dome with an expression of profound, baffled respect. They had done it. They had captured the lightning. They had their demo.

They packed up in the fading light, the single bare bulb now a beacon in the encroaching gloom. The work was slow, their bodies stiff with cold and aching from the focused intensity of the performance. But the mood was light, almost giddy. The hostility and tension had been burned away in the creative fire, replaced by a deep, unspoken camaraderie. They had faced an impossible task together and had succeeded. As Sharon coiled the last extension lead, she stood for a moment in the entrance tunnel, looking back into the vast, silent dark of the Grand Magazine. It was returning to its slumber, its centuries of silence disturbed for just a few hours. They were leaving it as they found it, but they were taking its echo, its voice, with them, trapped on a hard drive, a tangible piece of their future. She closed the heavy wooden door, turned the huge iron key in the lock, and the sound of the tumblers clicking into place was the final, satisfying percussion of a perfect take.The days that followed the recording session existed in a strange, suspended state of anticipation. The raw, monumental sound they had captured was now a tangible thing, a collection of digital files on a hard drive that Lucia guarded like the Crown Jewels. The high of their success in the Grand Magazine slowly subsided, replaced by the nervous, focused energy of the task ahead: turning that raw material into a demo fit for a record label. The meeting at Amalgamated Records loomed at the end of the week, a date circled in thick, threatening red marker on Lucia’s whiteboard, which had taken up permanent residence in her chaotic, book-strewn living room. Her flat, a top-floor apartment overlooking Southsea Common, became their new headquarters, smelling not of kebabs and despair, but of strong coffee and rising panic.

The mixing process became Maya’s domain. She sat at Lucia’s dining table, her laptop surrounded by a web of cables, her expression one of deep, almost spiritual concentration, her high-end headphones sealing her off from the outside world. She worked with the intense, meticulous focus of a bomb disposal expert, painstakingly balancing the raw tracks. She treated the dome’s five-second reverb not as an effect to be managed, but as a fourth instrument in the band, giving it its own space in the mix, allowing it to swell in the gaps and recede behind the sharper, more direct sounds. Gaz hovered behind her, a hulking, suspicious presence, peering over her shoulder every ten minutes. “Don’t make it sound too clever,” he would grumble. “I don’t want to sound like we’re selling expensive watches.” Maya would just nod, her eyes never leaving the screen. “The integrity of the source recording is paramount, Gaz. I am merely framing the photograph, not airbrushing it.”

Sharon’s role was less technical but equally crucial. Maya would periodically hand her the headphones, and Sharon would sit, eyes closed, and just listen. She was the final arbiter of feel. “The snare,” she’d say after a long silence. “It needs to crack more. It sounds too polite. It should sound like something breaking.” Or, “The kick drum… you can feel the reverb, but you’ve lost the initial thump. I need to feel it in my chest, like the first turn of a seized valve.” She spoke in the language of physical things, of plumbing and industry, and Maya, with her scientific precision, would translate her visceral instructions into adjustments of EQ and compression. They were a strange but effective team: the scientist, the traditionalist, and the mechanic, all presided over by Lucia, who paced the room, offering unhelpful but enthusiastic feedback like, “It needs to sound more… purple!” or “Can we make the guitars sound angrier, like they’ve just been given an outrageous utility bill?”

After three long evenings, they had it. Three tracks. ‘Burst Pipe’, ‘Southsea Mud’, and the frantic, punk-tinged ‘Boiler Ignition’. They were raw, powerful, and utterly uncompromising. They sounded like they had been forged in a shipyard, not polished in a studio. They sounded like The Stopcocks. Sharon left Lucia’s flat that night with the three finished tracks on a USB stick in her pocket, the small piece of plastic feeling as heavy and significant as the iron key to the Grand Magazine. The walk home through the quiet, sea-mist-dampened streets of Old Portsmouth was filled with a new kind of trepidation. She had her proof now. This wasn't just a noisy hobby anymore; it was a tangible, professionally realised creation. And she was about to present it to the one person whose opinion she dreaded and craved in equal measure.

She found Val in the living room, ostensibly reading a novel, but Sharon knew from the static set of her shoulders that she was really just waiting. The television was off. The silence in the room was a carefully maintained truce zone. Sharon stood in the doorway for a moment, her heart thumping a nervous, off-beat rhythm against her ribs. “Mam,” she said, her voice steadier than she felt. “Can I play you something?” Val looked up, her expression guarded. She placed a bookmark in her novel with deliberate care. “Is it going to be another… cacophony?” she asked, the word wielded with the precision of a surgeon’s scalpel. “It’s the demo,” Sharon replied, ignoring the barb. “It’s what we recorded. For the meeting on Friday. I just… I thought you should hear it.” She didn’t wait for an answer. She took her phone out, connected it to the small Bluetooth speaker she had once bought her mum for listening to Radio 4 in the kitchen, and took a deep breath. She pressed play on ‘Burst Pipe’.

The sound that filled the small, tidy living room was utterly alien. It was too big, too powerful for the space. The deep, resonant BOOM of the kick drum seemed to shake the commemorative plates on the mantelpiece, a low, seismic threat. The sharp, seven-eight crack of the snare sliced through the polite, Pledge-scented air. The music didn’t just play; it occupied the room, pushing against the floral wallpaper, shouldering the quiet out of the way. Val sat bolt upright in her armchair, her hands gripping the armrests, her face a mask of utter shock. She looked around the room as if the sound had a physical form, as if the walls themselves might suddenly give way. Sharon’s finger hovered over the stop button, a wave of shame and regret washing over her. This was a mistake, a violation. But before she could cut it off, Val held up a hand, a sharp, arresting gesture. “Leave it,” she commanded, her voice tight.

She sat through the entire three-and-a-half minutes of the song, her expression unreadable. She listened as the lurching, industrial rhythm gave way to Gaz’s jagged guitar and Maya’s deep, tectonic bassline. She listened to the vast, ghostly reverb of the dome, the sound of history itself echoing behind the noise. When the final, grinding chord faded into its long, slow decay, the silence that rushed back into the room was profound, as if the house itself were holding its breath. Val did not speak for a long time. She just stared at the small, innocuous speaker on the coffee table as if it were a dangerous, unexploded ordinance. Sharon’s stomach was in a tight, painful knot. Then, Val turned her gaze to her daughter. Her face was pale, and her eyes were wide. “Well,” she said, her voice a low, wondering whisper. “It’s not… knitting, is it?” She took a shaky breath. “It’s very… solid. It sounds like something being built. Something very big.” She looked at the speaker again, then back at Sharon, and a new, startling thought seemed to dawn on her. “And you… you’re the one holding it all up, aren’t you? The banging. The pulse. Without that, it would all just fall down.” It wasn't praise. It wasn't approval. It was a statement of fact. A technical observation from a woman who understood structures, who knew the importance of a solid foundation. And for Sharon, it felt like winning.

The day of the meeting arrived cold and bright. They assembled outside Sharon’s house like a team of nervous commandos about to be sent on a secret mission. Lucia had issued strict sartorial instructions. “You need to look like you don’t give a damn, but in a way that is utterly authentic and meticulously planned,” she had declared. The result was that they all looked like slightly more formal versions of themselves. Gaz wore a black denim jacket instead of a blue one. Maya had on a slightly different shade of black T-shirt. Sharon had swapped her work boots for a pair of black Doc Martens, a concession to business that felt like a costume. As they loaded into the van, Val appeared at the front door. She didn’t say a word, just handed Sharon the thermos and a Tupperware box. This time, the box contained bacon sandwiches. “For the journey,” she said, and then, before retreating inside, she added, so quietly Sharon almost missed it, “Knock ‘em dead, love.”

The journey to London was a high-wire act of managed anxiety. Lucia drove, her knuckles white on the steering wheel, delivering a last-minute briefing on record label terminology, peppering her speech with phrases like ‘publishing rights’ and ‘tour support’ that made Gaz flinch visibly. Sharon sat in the passenger seat, the London A-to-Z open on her lap, navigating them through the increasingly dense and hostile traffic, the simple, logical task a welcome distraction from the frantic butterflies in her stomach. In the back, Maya was reading a book on contract law, while Gaz stared out at the endless grey sprawl of the suburbs, his face set in a mask of stoic doom. The van felt like a spaceship, a small, self-contained bubble of Portsmouth grit hurtling towards the alien, unknowable heart of the music industry. As they pulled into a ferociously expensive car park in Shoreditch, a short walk from the record label’s office, Lucia cut the engine and turned to face them, her eyes burning with a terrifying, almost fanatical intensity. “Right,” she said, her voice low and steady. “Remember who you are. You’re The Stopcocks. You’re not here to ask for anything. You’re here to show them what they’re missing. Let them hear the noise. Let them hear the work. And for God’s sake, Gaz, try not to look like you’re about to start a fistfight.” Gaz just grunted, and pushed open his door. It was time. Phase three was no longer on a whiteboard; it was on the other side of a very clean, very intimidating glass door.The offices of Amalgamated Records were located in a narrow, aggressively modern building squeezed between a Victorian pub and a shop that sold artisanal dog biscuits. The reception area was an exercise in calculated minimalism. The floor was polished concrete, the walls were a stark, unforgiving white, and the only furniture was a low, backless sofa that looked less like a piece of seating and more like a punishment for loitering. The air smelled of expensive cleaning products and ambition. Behind a severe-looking white desk sat a young man with a haircut so sharp it could have been used to slice lemons. He didn't look up when they entered, his attention focused on his computer screen as if the secrets of the universe were contained within it. The only colour in the entire room came from the dozen gold and platinum discs that lined one wall, gleaming like captured suns, each one a testament to a sound that had been successfully packaged and sold to the masses.

They stood in a small, awkward cluster in the centre of the room, a damp, wool-and-denim island of Portsmouth grit in this sterile ocean of London cool. The Transit van, with its comforting scent of oil and old tea, felt a million miles away. Gaz looked around the room with open hostility, his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his black denim jacket, his posture radiating a desire to headbutt the nearest white wall. Maya was utterly still, her dark eyes scanning the room, taking in the acoustics, the lighting, the precise angle of the gold discs, her face a mask of neutral, analytical curiosity. Lucia, however, was in her element. She strode to the desk with the unshakeable confidence of someone who not only believed she belonged there, but who was slightly annoyed that a red carpet hadn't been rolled out. “Lucia Alvarez,” she announced, her voice clear and bright, “for Marcus Thorne. We have a ten-thirty appointment. For The Stopcocks.”

The receptionist’s eyes flickered up from his screen, his gaze sweeping over them with a glacial lack of interest before returning to his monitor. “He’s running late,” he said, his voice flat and bored. “Take a seat.” He gestured vaguely towards the backless sofa. The five of them shuffled over to the torture-slab and perched on it awkwardly, like a row of nervous pigeons on a dangerously narrow ledge. The waiting began. It was a special kind of silence, filled with the quiet, electronic hum of expensive technology and the frantic, internal monologue of five people convinced they had made a terrible mistake. Every so often, a stylishly dressed person would stride through the reception area, talking loudly into a phone about streaming numbers or sync deals, their every movement screaming with a casual, effortless importance that made Sharon feel like she was wearing her clothes inside out.

Gaz started cracking his knuckles, the sound like a series of small, sharp gunshots in the quiet room. “This is it, then,” he muttered to no one in particular. “This is where music comes to die. It smells like a hospital for money.” Lucia shot him a venomous glare, while Maya, seemingly unperturbed, pulled out her book on contract law and began to read, creating a small, private bubble of focus in the midst of the rising tension. Sharon just sat, her hands clasped tightly in her lap, focusing on her own breathing. She tried to find a rhythm in the room to anchor herself to, but there was none. There was only the low, featureless hum of the air conditioning and the frantic, irregular thumping of her own heart. She felt profoundly out of place, a solid, analogue object in a slick, digital world.

After what felt like an eternity, a door opened and Simon, the man from The Engine Room, emerged. His nose ring glinted in the stark light, and his face broke into a genuine, enthusiastic grin when he saw them. “There you are!” he said, his voice a welcome blast of warmth in the cold room. “Sorry about the wait. Marcus is on a conference call with LA. He thinks sleep is a sign of weakness.” He led them through a set of frosted glass doors and down a corridor that was even whiter and more silent than the reception area. “He’s heard the demo,” Simon whispered conspiratorially as they walked. “He said it was… bracing.” He ushered them into a meeting room dominated by a long, dark wood table and chairs that were probably worth more than Sharon’s van. The fourth wall was a single, immense pane of glass, offering a panoramic, god-like view of the London skyline.

A man was standing by the window, his back to them, talking into a Bluetooth earpiece. This, presumably, was Marcus Thorne. He was tall and lean, dressed in a suit so exquisitely tailored it seemed to have been woven directly onto his body. He finished his call, turned, and gave them a brief, assessing smile that didn’t come anywhere near his eyes. He looked to be in his late forties, his face tanned and handsome, his hair artfully silvered at the temples. He radiated a calm, predatory authority. “The Stopcocks,” he said, his voice smooth and deep, a voice accustomed to getting its own way. “Marcus Thorne. Good of you to come all this way.” He shook Lucia’s hand, then glanced at the rest of them, his eyes lingering for a fraction of a second too long on Gaz’s belligerent posture and Sharon’s work-worn hands. “Simon here is very excited. He described your sound as ‘industrial-maritime-blues’. I’m not sure that’s a section we currently have in HMV, but I’m always open to new genres.”

They all took a seat around the vast table, feeling like a gang of unruly schoolchildren summoned to the headmaster’s office. Lucia, to her credit, was unfazed. She launched straight into her pitch, her voice ringing with passion as she spoke of the band’s authenticity, their unique sound, their deep connection to the history and the grit of their city. Marcus listened, his face a mask of polite interest, his fingers steepled, giving nothing away. When Lucia finished, he gave a small, slow nod. “A very compelling narrative,” he said, the word ‘narrative’ subtly reframing their entire existence as a marketable story. “But the music business, alas, is not a literary festival. It’s a business. Let’s have a listen, shall we?” He gestured to a set of discreet, high-end speakers embedded in the wall. Simon, at a laptop, cued up the first track.

The opening BOOM of ‘Burst Pipe’ slammed into the pristine, climate-controlled air of the meeting room. It was an act of sonic vandalism. The sound was too big, too raw, too real for this clean, glass-and-steel box. The seismic kick drum seemed to vibrate through the floor, the whip-crack of the snare a physical assault. The sheer, unadulterated noise of it, the sound they had so painstakingly captured in the cold, dark dome, felt like a wild animal unleashed in a china shop. Sharon watched Marcus’s face, searching for a reaction. His polite mask didn’t slip, but she saw his eyes widen almost imperceptibly at the first lurch into the seven-eight time signature. He wasn't just hearing it; he was analysing it, deconstructing it, assessing its commercial viability with the cold, dispassionate eye of a butcher weighing a carcass.

When the track finished, its long, ghostly tail of reverb fading into the hum of the air conditioning, a heavy silence descended. Marcus stared at the speaker for a long moment, his head tilted. “Well,” he said finally. “It’s certainly… loud.” He turned his gaze on them, a slow, deliberate sweep. “There’s an energy there. It’s undeniable. It’s raw. It’s authentic.” He used the buzzwords like he was ticking boxes on a form. “But,” he continued, and Sharon felt her stomach clench, “it’s also a very difficult listen. The structure is unconventional, the mix is incredibly raw, and there’s nothing resembling a hook. As a piece of art, it’s intriguing. As a product, it’s a problem.” He leaned forward, his smooth voice dropping into a more conspiratorial tone. “What I propose is this: we put you in a proper studio. We team you up with a producer, someone like Alistair Finch—he did that last big album for The Accelerants, fantastic ear for a radio hit. He can help you shape this raw energy. Find the choruses. Sand down some of the… rougher edges. We find a way to make this sound palatable to a wider audience without, of course,” he added, with a thin, insincere smile, “losing your unique identity.”

This was it. The devil’s bargain, delivered on a silver platter. Gaz made a low, guttural noise in his throat and looked like he was about to physically launch himself across the table. Lucia’s face was a frantic, desperate mask as she tried to find a positive spin. But Marcus wasn’t looking at them. His gaze had settled on Sharon. He had correctly identified her as the quiet centre, the one whose reaction would determine the group’s trajectory. “Sharon, isn’t it?” he said, his voice slick and persuasive. “You’re the heartbeat of this thing. The foundation. Surely you can see the logic in building a more accessible house on that foundation?” All eyes in the room turned to her. The silence was absolute. She felt the immense pressure of the moment, the weight of her band’s future settling squarely on her shoulders. She looked at Marcus’s expectant, smiling face, then at her own hands, resting on the polished, expensive wood of the table. They were plumber’s hands. They were drummer’s hands. They were not made for sanding down rough edges. They were made for dealing with the pressure, the grit, the solid, unglamorous truth of things. She took a breath, met his gaze, and gave him her answer.
