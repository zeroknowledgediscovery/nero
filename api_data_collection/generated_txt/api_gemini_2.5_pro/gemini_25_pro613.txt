The rain in Upper Gristle didn't so much fall as it seeped. It seeped from the bruised flannel sky, seeped up through the ancient cobblestones, seeped into the very marrow of Detective Inspector Evelyn Publicover’s bones. This was her third month on the Anglo-American Policing Exchange, and she’d concluded that the primary export of this corner of England wasn’t tweed or artisanal cheese, but a profound and inescapable dampness. It was a cold that her Maine upbringing, with its honest, dry-ice winters, had not prepared her for. This was a chill that promised mildew and secrets.

Her phone buzzed against the cheap laminate of her desk, a jarring American sound in the musty quiet of the station house. She glanced at the caller ID—DS Finch—and swiped to answer, propping it between her shoulder and ear. "Publicover."

"Morning, Inspector. Got a pot on, if you're game." Detective Sergeant Alistair Finch’s voice was the auditory equivalent of a rumpled cardigan—worn, comfortable, and smelling faintly of digestive biscuits.

"Coffee, Finch. We've been over this. Tea is just leaf-flavored water." She could practically hear him shrug. "What's the shout?"

"Missing person. Headmaster at the local primary, St. Jude’s, reported it an hour ago. One of his teachers, a Mr. Albright. Arthur Albright. Didn't show for morning assembly, didn't call in. Not like him, apparently. The man's punctual to a fault."

"Punctual people are the only ones who can go missing properly," Publicover muttered, pulling on her waxed jacket. It felt clammy to the touch. "Where are you?"

"Albright's cottage. Number three, Weaver's Lane. It's quaint. You'll hate it."

He wasn't wrong. Weaver’s Lane was a postcard of England that tourists paid good money to see and that Publicover was paid to find vaguely threatening. Thatched roofs, heavy with moss, slumped over crooked timber frames. Rose bushes, skeletal and thorny in the late autumn, clawed at limestone walls. Albright’s cottage was the most aggressively charming of the lot, with a bright blue door and leaded windows that looked like compound eyes. A single, uniformed constable, looking about twelve years old, stood sentinel by the gate.

Finch was waiting for her in the garden, a tall, stooping man whose shoulders seemed permanently braced for a downpour. "Inspector." He nodded, holding a steaming mug that was definitely not coffee. "Told you. Quaint."

"It looks like a gnome's house," Publicover said, her gaze sweeping the property. The lawn was neatly trimmed, but the flowerbeds were a mess of churned, dark soil. Odd, for a man described as meticulous. "Forced entry?"

"None. Back door was unlocked. We've had a look-see. Everything seems in its place. Wallet's on the kitchen table, keys in the dish. Cup of tea, half-drunk, by his reading chair. It’s like he just… evaporated." Finch took a sip from his mug. "Only thing odd is the bed. It's made. Headmistress said he lives alone. Who makes their bed if they're not expecting company?"

"I do," Publicover said flatly. Force of habit. Marine Corps discipline died hard. "It's about controlling what you can." She crouched by the disturbed flowerbed, the hem of her trousers immediately soaking up the cold water from the grass. The soil was rich and black. And in it, half-obscured by a drooping dahlia, was a single, partial footprint. It was enormous. Far too big for the missing Mr. Albright, who Finch had described as 'a bit of a sparrow'. It was also deep, as if stamped there by an immense weight. She stared at it, a cold knot tightening in her stomach that had nothing to do with the English weather. She didn't point it out to Finch. Not yet. This was her observation, a small, ugly piece of data to be filed away behind her eyes.

Inside, the cottage smelled of beeswax and old paper. Books were everywhere, stacked on floors, crammed into shelves, perched on every available surface. Albright was a history teacher, and his home was a shrine to it. Publicover ran a gloved finger along a spine. *A Social History of English Culinary Traditions*. She moved into the small kitchen. It was tidy, except for a single crumbly pastry wrapper in the bin. The branding was unfamiliar, a gaudy gold and purple affair with florid script: *Ronda’s Remarkable Pies*.

"Right," Finch said, joining her. "So, no signs of a struggle. Nothing obviously missing but the man himself. He’s sixty-two, fit as a fiddle according to his doctor, no known enemies. Loved by his students, respected by his peers. Just… gone."

"No one's 'just gone,' Finch," Publicover said, her voice low. "There's always a reason. There's always a trail. We just haven't found it yet." She gestured towards the door. "Let's talk to the neighbours. And find out who Ronda is."

Their canvassing yielded little more than a collective shrug from the residents of Weaver’s Lane. Mr. Albright was a lovely man, a quiet man, kept himself to himself. No one heard anything, no one saw anything. The fog, they all said, had been particularly thick last night. It had swallowed the world whole.

The name Ronda, however, elicited a different response. A flicker of something in their eyes. Respect, perhaps. Or maybe fear.

"Oh, Ronda," said an elderly woman, pruning her already skeletal roses with vicious snips. "Her pies are simply divine. A bit rich for my blood, but my husband can't get enough."

"Ronda's? In the market square," said the postman, his face lighting up. "Best steak and kidney in the county. The crust… flaky as anything."

It was a chorus of culinary praise. Ronda, it seemed, was the town’s baker, a purveyor of savoury pastries that bordered on the legendary. Her shop, Finch explained as they drove towards the market square, was an institution. She’d opened it about five years ago and had become an overnight sensation.

The market square was the town’s hub, a wide-open space paved with the same treacherous cobblestones. On one side, framed between a bookmaker's and a dusty antique shop, was a storefront painted a cheerful, buttery yellow. A large sign, carved from a single piece of dark wood, hung above it: *Ronda's Remarkable Pies*. The windows were spotless, displaying a pyramid of golden-brown pastries that did, admittedly, look remarkable. A plume of fragrant steam puffed from a small vent above the door, carrying a scent of such intense, meaty richness that it made Publicover’s stomach clench with an instinct that was not hunger.

"Here we are," Finch said, parking the car. "Prepare to be charmed."

The bell above the door chimed a delicate, three-note melody as they entered. The air inside was thick and hot, almost tropical, and heavy with the smell of baked pastry, cooked meat, and a complex bouquet of herbs she couldn't immediately place. Sage, definitely. Thyme. And something else, something deeper and sweeter. The place was unnervingly clean. Not a speck of flour dusted the floorboards, not a smear marred the glass of the counter.

And then she saw her.

The prompt had called Ronda a giant. Publicover, a woman who had seen the extremes of human physicality in combat zones, had been skeptical. She was not skeptical now. Standing behind the counter, a comically small rolling pin in one hand, was the largest woman she had ever seen. Ronda wasn't just tall; she was wide, a monolith of flesh and bone clad in a pristine white apron. She must have been close to seven feet tall, with shoulders that strained the seams of her dress and arms as thick as oak limbs. But it wasn't just her size that was arresting. It was her face. Her features were surprisingly, unsettlingly delicate. Small, dark eyes, a pert nose, and a Cupid's bow mouth set in a sea of pale, doughy flesh. Her hair was pulled back in a severe bun, so tight it stretched the skin at her temples. She moved with a strange, fluid grace, her massive form gliding behind the counter as if on casters.

"Sergeant Finch," she said, her voice a breathy, melodic soprano that was utterly at odds with her frame. "And who is this?" Her small, dark eyes fixed on Publicover, a gaze that was both welcoming and deeply analytical.

"Inspector Publicover," Finch said, a little too brightly. "She's on secondment from the States. We're just having a word with local business owners. A teacher from St. Jude's has gone missing. Mr. Albright."

Ronda’s perfectly shaped mouth formed a small 'o' of surprise. "Arthur? Oh, the poor dear man. Such a sweetheart. He adored my lamb and rosemary pies." She gestured to the display. "He’d always say my crust was 'historically significant'." A small, dimpled smile appeared. It did not reach her eyes. "Is there anything I can do to help?"

"Did you see him yesterday, by any chance?" Publicover asked, her voice cutting through the warm, thick air.

Ronda’s gaze slid to her. It was like being appraised by a jeweller. "Let me think." She tapped a huge finger against her chin. "He usually comes in on a Tuesday. But no, I don't believe I saw him. The fog was so dreadful last night, wasn't it? It keeps people in. Bad for business, but good for a quiet evening."

Publicover’s eyes drifted from Ronda’s face to her hands. They were massive, but clean, the nails immaculately manicured. No soil under them. Of course there wasn't. Everything here was clean. Too clean.

"We found one of your wrappers in his bin," Publicover stated, watching for a reaction.

There was none. Just a widening of the smile. "He was a loyal customer. The most loyal." She leaned forward, her immense form casting a shadow over the counter. The rich, meaty smell intensified. "Can I offer you two gentlemen a pie? On the house. For all your hard work keeping this town safe." Her eyes twinkled, a black, bottomless humor in their depths. "Steak and ale, perhaps? It's a very… robust flavour."

"No, thank you," Publicover said quickly. "We're on duty."

"We'd love one," Finch said at the exact same time, his policeman's instinct for a free meal overriding any other sense.

Ronda laughed, a sound like tiny bells ringing in a vast cavern. "One for the road, then, Sergeant." With surprising deftness, she plucked a pie from the display, slipped it into a gold and purple bag, and handed it to Finch. Her fingers brushed his. He didn't seem to notice her touch, but Publicover did. She saw the way the woman’s eyes lingered on him, a flash of something possessive and strange.

They left the shop, the delicate chime of the bell seeing them out. Finch was already fumbling with the bag, the pastry's aroma filling the car. "See? Perfectly lovely lady. And a free pie. Nothing sinister here."

Publicover didn't answer. She was looking in the rearview mirror. The buttery yellow storefront was shrinking with distance, but she could still see the window. And in the window, a massive silhouette stood perfectly still, watching them go. The knot in her stomach was a cold, hard stone now. That footprint in the garden. The cloying sweetness of the pie shop. The sheer, impossible scale of the woman and the unnerving intelligence in her eyes. Mr. Albright, the history teacher, who loved her pies and thought her crust was significant, was gone. And Ronda, the giant, was still here, baking. A thought, ugly and unbidden, surfaced in her mind, a piece of grim folklore from a childhood book. *Fee-fi-fo-fum*. She pushed it down, hard. This was a missing person case. That's all it was. For now.Finch tore into the pie with an enthusiasm Publicover found unnerving. A flake of golden crust landed on his jumper. "Oh, that's the stuff," he mumbled through a mouthful of steak and gravy. "See? Best in the county. Probably the country. You Americans with your burgers and hot dogs don't know what you're missing." He offered the greasy bag to her. "Go on, Inspector. Live a little." Publicover shook her head, her eyes fixed on the road ahead, though her mind was back in the unnaturally clean shop. The memory of Ronda’s small, dark eyes watching her, weighing her, was more vivid than the rain-slicked street in front of them. The warmth of the pie shop hadn't been comforting; it had been oppressive, the air thick with secrets you could almost taste.

"Finch, how long has she been here?" Publicover asked, her voice tight. "You said five years."

"Thereabouts," he confirmed, dabbing at his mouth with the back of his hand. "Showed up out of nowhere, really. Bought the old bakery, which had been derelict for a decade. Gutted it, refurbished it herself, mostly. Word is she barely hired any help. People thought it was odd at first, this… well, this giant of a woman setting up shop. But then they tasted the pies." He took another large bite, chewing thoughtfully. "After that, no one much cared where she came from. She was just Ronda. Our Ronda."

"No one 'just shows up,' Finch. Everyone comes from somewhere," she countered, turning onto the main road that led back to the station. "Did anyone run a background check? Look into her history?" Finch shrugged, a gesture that conveyed a mix of indifference and the mild defensiveness of a man whose comfortable world was being questioned. "Why would we? She wasn't a suspect in anything. She was a baker. A bloody good one. This is Upper Gristle, Inspector, not Boston. We don't tend to view newcomers with suspicion unless they give us a reason to. And Ronda's only ever given us delicious, reasonably priced savoury goods."

Publicover fell silent, letting his words hang in the air. That was the core of it. The charm was a shield. The pies were a passport. Ronda had integrated herself so perfectly into the fabric of the town that she had become part of the scenery, as unquestioned as the ancient church spire or the perpetual damp. But Publicover was an outsider. She hadn't been lulled by five years of flawless crust and rich gravy. She saw the anomaly. She saw the huge footprint in the meticulous man's garden. She saw the single pastry wrapper in the bin of a man who was now gone. And she had seen the flicker of something cold and appraising in the baker’s eyes, a look that had nothing to do with selling pies. The car's heater fought a losing battle against the chill that had settled deep inside her, a cold that had followed her out of that warm, fragrant shop.

Back in the fluorescent hum of the station, the half-eaten pie sat on Finch’s desk, its meaty aroma now seeming faintly obscene in the sterile environment. Publicover stood before the whiteboard, a dry-erase marker squeaking as she wrote 'Arthur Albright' at the top. Beneath it, she wrote 'Meticulous', 'Punctual', 'History Teacher', 'Lived Alone'. She drew a line, then wrote 'Ronda – Pie Shop'. She circled it. Then she drew an arrow from Albright to Ronda and wrote 'Loyal Customer'. She tapped the marker against the board. "The flowerbed," she said, turning to face Finch, who was scrolling through his phone. "It was a mess. Churned earth. You said Albright was meticulous."

Finch looked up, frowning. "Maybe he was planning on doing some autumn planting. It's the season for it."

"With a single, size-sixteen footprint stamped in the middle of it?" Publicover shot back. Finch’s frown deepened. He hadn’t seen the footprint; she had deliberately kept it to herself, a private piece of the puzzle. Now was the time to share. "There was a footprint in the mud, by the dahlias. Massive. And deep. Whoever made it was very, very heavy." She let the implication land. Finch’s eyes widened almost imperceptibly as he made the obvious, incredible connection. He looked from Publicover’s intense face to the remains of the pie on his desk, and a little of the colour drained from his cheeks.

"You can't be serious," he whispered, the words barely audible over the buzz of the overhead lights. "Ronda? She’s… she’s a local treasure. It’s absurd." But the certainty had gone from his voice, replaced by a dawning thread of horror. He pushed the pie bag slightly further away from him. "A footprint doesn't mean anything, Inspector. Anyone could have a big lad wandering through their garden."

"In the middle of a foggy night? A 'big lad' so heavy he sinks six inches into the soil? A big lad who happens to be the same size as the local baker whose pastry wrapper is the only thing out of place in our missing person’s house?" Publicover paced in front of the board, the pieces clicking into a grotesque, unbelievable shape in her mind. "Albright was a history teacher. He told her her crust was 'historically significant.' What if that wasn't a compliment, Finch? What if it was a message? A discovery? What if he found something out?" The question hung in the air, smelling not of rich gravy, but of decay.

Finch stared at the whiteboard as if it were a gallows. "Historically significant crust? What the hell does that even mean?" He ran a hand through his already untidy hair. "It’s pastry. Lard, flour, water. Maybe some butter if you’re feeling decadent. It’s not a Bronze Age burial mound."

"Isn’t it?" Publicover stopped pacing and fixed him with her gaze. "His house was a library. *A Social History of English Culinary Traditions*. You think a man like that uses words carelessly? No. That comment was specific. It was pointed. He was telling her something he knew." She strode over to her own desk, grabbed her laptop, and slammed it down, flipping it open. "Run her name. Ronda. Just Ronda. No last name. See if any official records exist. Business license, tax returns, deed for the shop. And run the name of the business. *Ronda’s Remarkable Pies*."

As Finch reluctantly turned to his own terminal, his face a mask of disbelief at war with professional duty, Publicover began her own search. She didn't type in Ronda's name. She typed in folklore. English giants. Regional myths. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, chasing the ghost of the nursery rhyme that had surfaced in her mind. She scrolled through tales of benevolent giants who built causeways and ill-tempered ones who hurled stones that became local landmarks. And then she found something else. Buried in an obscure academic journal of folkloric studies, she found a reference to a cycle of tales from the misty, forgotten corners of the West Country, not far from where Upper Gristle sat brooding in its damp valley. The stories all featured a similar character, though the name changed with the telling. A lonely, unnaturally large woman who was a peerless cook. A woman who would appear in a village, win over the locals with her magnificent food, and become a beloved fixture. For a time. Then, people would start to disappear. Quietly at first. A traveller. A recluse. People who wouldn't be missed right away. People like a history teacher who lived alone. The article noted a peculiar detail common to all the legends: the woman’s specialty was always meat pies.A cold sweat had broken out on Finch’s brow, a dampness born of something other than the eternal English humidity. He stared at his monitor, his face pale in its blue-white glow. "Nothing," he said, his voice hushed. "Absolutely bloody nothing. The business, *Ronda’s Remarkable Pies Ltd.*, is registered to a holding company, which is registered to another one in an office park in Slough. It’s a Russian doll of paperwork designed to lead nowhere. As for the name Ronda… there’s no driver’s license, no national insurance number, no tax record. As far as the British government is concerned, she doesn't exist." He looked at Publicover, his comfortable world visibly crumbling. "She's a ghost."

"No, she's not a ghost," Publicover replied, her voice low and certain. She hadn’t moved from her spot by the whiteboard. "She's a story." She held up her laptop, turning the screen towards him. It showed a page from a digitized academic text, filled with dense paragraphs and footnotes. "These are from the archives of the Somerset Folklife Society, 1922. They document a recurring figure in the local mythology of this specific region. The stories vary, but the core is always the same. A woman of prodigious size, a culinary genius, who appears in a town and ingratiates herself with the locals through her cooking. They call her by various names—Greedy Meg, the Gristlewood Dame, Mother Tallow… and in one version, simply Ronda."

Finch pushed his chair back and walked slowly towards her laptop, peering at the screen as if it might bite him. "They're fairy tales, Inspector."

"Are they?" Publicover’s gaze was sharp. "The stories say her specialty was always savoury pies, famed for their incredible richness. And that after a few years of peace, people on the fringes of the community would begin to vanish. The lonely ones. The quiet ones. The ones who kept to themselves." She paused, letting the words sink in before delivering the final, chilling detail. "And the article mentions a specific, historical element to the legend. Mother Tallow’s crust was said to be so light, so flaky, because she used a 'secret family recipe' passed down through generations. A recipe that used rendered fat and finely ground bone meal as a binding agent."

The air in the room grew thin and cold. Finch’s eyes darted from the laptop screen to the greasy paper bag on his desk. The remains of his lunch. The rich, meaty smell he had so enjoyed now seemed to crawl up his nostrils like the scent of rot. He swallowed hard, his throat suddenly tight and dry. Arthur Albright, the history teacher. *A Social History of English Culinary Traditions*. A man who would know that certain ancient, and sometimes ritualistic, baking practices used every part of an animal. Every. Single. Part. "Historically significant," he whispered, the phrase now twisted into a monstrous accusation. It wasn't a compliment. It was Albright signing his own death warrant. He had recognised the recipe.

Publicover followed his horrified gaze to the pie. "She wasn't just feeding him, Finch. She was testing him. Maybe even taunting him. And when he let her know that he knew… she tidied up." The fluorescent lights of the office hummed, a flat, indifferent sound against the enormity of the implication. The world of procedure and paperwork had collided with something ancient and ravenous, and the wreckage was a half-eaten pastry sitting on a Formica desk.

"My God," Finch breathed, stumbling back a step and pressing a hand to his stomach. A wave of nausea rolled through him as he remembered the tender meat, the rich gravy, the flaky, unforgettable crust. He had praised it. He had savoured it. The memory was now an act of violation. "I ate it. I ate it."

"Pull yourself together, Sergeant," Publicover’s voice was a steel rod in the swirling fog of his panic. She strode to his desk, her face set like stone. She looked at the pie with a cold, professional detachment that was more terrifying than any scream. "We need proof. We need to know what's in that pie. And we need to do it without tipping our hand or getting laughed off the force for suggesting the town's favourite baker is a character from a Grimm’s fairytale."

She picked up a pair of evidence tongs and a sterile bag from her supply drawer. The clinical nature of the act was a small anchor in the madness. "I have a contact. A forensic pathologist at St. Bart's in London. He's… open-minded. And he owes me a favour from my time at Quantico. We'll courier it to him directly. Official request will be for an 'unidentified protein analysis' in a potential poisoning case. It’s vague enough. It keeps it quiet. It keeps it between us."

With the tongs, she carefully nudged the remains of the steak and ale pie from its greasy paper cradle into the clear plastic bag. Finch watched, mesmerised in horror. It looked so ordinary. A lump of cold pastry and congealed gravy. Yet it felt like they were handling a cursed object, an artefact of an unspeakable ritual. He could still smell it, a phantom scent that now made his gorge rise. Publicover sealed the bag with a decisive zip, the sound unnaturally loud in the silent room. She labelled it with a black marker: case number, date, time, 'Item #1: Partially Consumed Foodstuff.' The mundane language was a shield against the unbelievable truth. She held up the bag. Inside, the pie sat, a golden-brown monument to a secret as old as the damp, dark earth of Upper Gristle itself.

"Right," she said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Now we find out what made Mr. Albright’s favourite pie so robust."Finch stared at the evidence bag on the desk, then at his own hands, as if expecting to see grease and blood on them. He felt a profound sense of internal contamination, a violation that went deeper than simple disgust. He had not just eaten a pie; he had participated in a sacrament of unspeakable horror, and the knowledge of it was a poison working its way through him. Publicover, meanwhile, operated with the chilling efficiency of a bomb disposal expert. She pulled out a secure courier box, lined it with foam, and placed the sealed bag inside as if it were a delicate piece of machinery.

She made the call on her mobile, turning her back to Finch as if to grant him a moment to compose himself. Her conversation was clipped, a string of professional jargon that skirted the grotesque truth. "Leo, it's Eve Publicover... Yeah, Maine's a long way away. Listen, I'm sending something your way, off the books for now... A food sample from a missing person's case. I need a full workup... specifically, I need you to isolate and identify the primary protein source. Don't use the standard lab; this one's for your eyes only... I know it's a big ask. Let's just say the local cuisine is more 'artisanal' than advertised. I'll text you the tracking number." She hung up, her face a mask of grim resolve. "A police courier will have it in London by morning. We should have preliminary results in forty-eight hours, if he pushes it."

"Forty-eight hours?" Finch’s voice was a croak. He felt a desperate urge to go and scrub his mouth out with soap, to gargle with bleach. "What do we do for forty-eight hours? Wander around town knowing that… that she's in there, rolling out dough? Serving people…" He couldn't finish the sentence. He waved a hand vaguely toward the window, toward the town square, which now seemed like a pasture full of blissfully grazing sheep.

"We work the case," Publicover said, her tone leaving no room for argument. She took a permanent marker and drew a large circle around Ronda’s name on the whiteboard. From that circle, she began to draw spokes. "She's been here for five years. Albright can't be the first. This kind of… appetite… doesn't just develop overnight. It's a pattern. We need to find the other data points." She capped the marker and turned to him, her eyes intense. "I want to see every missing person's report filed in this constabulary and the surrounding districts for the last five years. I don't care how minor. Runaways, ramblers who got lost on the moors, elderly people who supposedly wandered off. We're building a new timeline, and it starts the day Ronda's Remarkable Pies opened for business."

The station’s records room was a cramped, windowless space in the basement that smelled of mildew, decaying paper, and forgotten sorrows. Cardboard boxes, sagging under the weight of years, were stacked to the ceiling. Finch, moving with the slow, deliberate motions of a man in shock, located the boxes for the relevant years. They lugged them out into the main office, the dust motes dancing in the flat, fluorescent light like tiny ghosts. For hours, they worked in near silence, broken only by the rustle of paper and the occasional weary sigh from Finch. Publicover was a machine, her eyes scanning reports with methodical speed, cross-referencing names, dates, and locations. Finch felt as if he were digging through a mass grave. Each report represented a life that had simply… stopped.

He found the first one. A file from three years ago. "Horace Fenn," he read aloud, his voice flat. "Seventy-one. Retired archivist. Lived alone on the edge of town. No family to speak of. His milk deliveries started piling up. We went in, place was neat as a pin. Car in the garage. His wallet and pension book were on the mantelpiece. We searched the moors for weeks. The working theory was he'd gone for one of his long walks and had a fall." Finch looked at Publicover, his eyes hollow. "He was quiet. Kept to himself. People described him as 'a bit eccentric'."

Publicover slid a new file across the desk without a word. Finch opened it. Another one, from eighteen months prior. "Brenda Gables. Sixty-four. A widow. Lived in a small cottage down by the river. Her sister in Australia reported her missing after she missed their weekly phone call for a month straight. The house had been sold by then, through a solicitor who held her power of attorney. The file says she was planning to move to a seaside town, but no one could ever confirm where. Case closed." She, too, was a recluse. The file noted that neighbours often commented on the delicious smells of baking that came from her house, before she vanished.

They lined the files up on the desk: Albright, Fenn, Gables. Three quiet people. Three lives that had ended without a ripple, their disappearances written off as the unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected, side effects of a solitary existence. It was a pattern of erasure, a quiet culling of the flock. Then Finch picked up a fourth file, a slim one from four years back. He opened it, read the name, and a small, choked sound escaped his lips. "Oh, no."

Publicover looked up, her focus instantly sharpening at the change in his tone. "What is it?"

Finch stared at the photograph stapled to the report—a faded snapshot of a man with a wild beard and kind eyes, wearing a ludicrously colourful knitted hat. "Timmy Long. We all called him Long Timmy. He wasn't… right in the head. Harmless, though. Used to wander the town, collecting shiny things. Bottle caps, bits of foil, old buttons. He'd show you his 'treasures'." Finch's voice cracked. "He lived in a shack out past Weaver's Lane. Slept on a pile of old coats. He vanished one winter. We all just assumed he’d finally succumbed to the cold or wandered off to another town." Finch looked at Publicover, a terrible, dawning comprehension in his eyes. He tapped a line in the report with a trembling finger. "His favourite food… what he'd spend his few coins on when he had them… was a hot pie from the market square."The photograph of Long Timmy was not a standard-issue custody photo, but a candid snap someone had taken during a village fête. He was smiling, a gap-toothed, guileless grin, holding up a string of iridescent beetle wings he had found. It was the face of a man who inhabited a world parallel to everyone else’s, a world of small wonders that others overlooked. And he was gone. Consumed not just by the cold, but by the town’s newest, warmest, most beloved institution. The weight of that knowledge seemed to physically crush Finch. He sank into his chair, the file clutched in his hand like a death certificate. He had given Timmy a pound coin himself, just a week before he vanished. "Go on," he'd said, "get yourself something warm." He felt the phantom taste of steak and ale in his throat again, and this time he had to fight a violent, physical urge to gag.

Publicover watched him, her expression unreadable. She took the file from his numb fingers and placed it on the growing stack. Four files. Four quiet lives. A retired archivist, a reclusive widow, a homeless man with the mind of a child, and a history teacher who knew too much. They were the threads that, when pulled, would unravel the entire, comfortable cardigan of Upper Gristle. "These are just the ones we have in our jurisdiction," she said, her voice a low anchor in the swirling chaos of Finch's thoughts. "She was in business for five years. This is a low estimate. This is just the local harvest." The agricultural term was deliberate, and it made Finch flinch. She was categorizing the victims with the same cold precision she'd used to label the evidence bag.

"So what now?" Finch finally managed, his voice raspy. "We can't just wait for a call from London while she's… shopping for ingredients." The euphemism was ghastly, but it was the only way he could phrase it. "We have to watch her."

"A two-person surveillance team on a seven-foot-tall woman who owns the most popular shop in the town square? She'd spot us in five minutes," Publicover countered, already moving back to the whiteboard. "She's not stupid, Finch. She's a predator who has survived for who knows how long by being smarter, cleaner, and more charming than everyone around her. We can't watch the hunter. But we can try to guard the herd." She picked up the marker again. "Think. Who else? Who fits the profile? Solitary, few close relatives, no one who'd raise an immediate national alarm if they missed a phone call. And, most importantly, who loves her pies?"

Finch squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to think past the nausea. He mentally scrolled through the faces of the town, an act that now felt like scanning an obituary column in advance. His mind snagged on one. "Eleanor Vance," he said quietly. "She's the town librarian. Never married, no children. Lives in the flat above the library. She's getting on, must be near seventy. She orders a box of Ronda's chicken and leek pies every Friday. Says it saves her cooking for the weekend." The image was horribly clear in his mind: Miss Vance, a gentle woman with reading glasses perched on her nose, accepting a gold and purple bag from Ronda's huge, clean hands.

Publicover wrote the name on the board and circled it. 'ELEANOR VANCE - LIBRARIAN'. "That's our priority," she declared. "We keep her from becoming number five. We can't tell her why. We can't park a car outside her door. But we can be present. Your local knowledge, my outsider's face. We become part of the background noise around her. We check in, invent reasons to be near the library. We make her a less appealing target." Her strategy was clear: a predator prefers to pick off an isolated animal, not one with shepherds hovering nearby.

The next day dawned with a sky the colour of a lead pipe. The damp was, if possible, even more profound. They began their unofficial, two-person protection detail. Finch went into the library, feigning an interest in local parish records. He found Miss Vance in the history section, carefully reshelving a book. She was a small, bird-like woman, exactly as he’d described, with kind, watery blue eyes behind her spectacles. She smiled brightly at him. "Sergeant Finch, what a pleasant surprise! Finally taking an interest in the town's sordid past?" Her gentle humour was a knife in his gut. He made awkward conversation, his gaze repeatedly flicking towards the large front window, half-expecting to see a giant silhouette blotting out the weak morning light.

Publicover took the afternoon shift, sitting in a small café across from the library, nursing a cup of what passed for coffee and pretending to read a day-old newspaper. From her vantage point, she could see both the entrance to the library and, further down the square, the buttery yellow facade of Ronda's Remarkable Pies. She watched the steady stream of customers, mothers with children, office workers on their lunch break, elderly couples. They'd enter the shop and emerge moments later, smiling, clutching their warm paper bags. One of them was the elderly woman from Weaver’s Lane, the one who had been pruning her roses. She bought two pies. Publicover felt a cold dread watching the scene. Ronda wasn’t just a monster hiding in the shadows; she was the heart of the town, pumping her poison through its veins, and the town loved her for it.

Just after three o'clock, the school bell from St. Jude's rang, and a wave of children washed across the square. A small group of them, no older than ten, stopped outside the pie shop. The door opened, and Ronda herself appeared, stooping to get through the frame. She smiled, a vast, dimpled grin, and handed each child a small, sausage-roll-like pastry. It was a common sight, Finch had told her; she often gave away the day's leftovers to the local children. The children took them with cries of delight, shouting "Thank you, Ronda!" as they ran off, biting into the flaky pastry. Ronda watched them go, her small, dark eyes following their retreating forms. Her expression was not one of simple benevolence. It was something else. Something proprietary. The look of a farmer, contentedly watching her livestock fatten in the field. Publicover felt her blood run cold. She folded her newspaper, the flimsy paper crinkling in her white-knuckled grip. The call from London couldn't come soon enough.The wait was a corrosive acid. Publicover and Finch spent the night and the following morning in a state of suspended animation, poring over the old case files again and again as if the sheer force of their attention could conjure a new clue from the faded ink. They spoke little, each trapped in their own cycle of grim thoughts. For Finch, every rustle of paper was the ghost of a life, every photograph a face he now saw as a menu item. He felt a phantom ache in his stomach that was part of the body’s memory of the pie, a deep, cellular revulsion. Publicover was quieter, her energy coiled inwards. She was processing, calculating, building a psychological profile of a creature that shouldn’t exist, treating it like any other asymmetrical threat she had analyzed in her past. A monster was still a perpetrator, and every perpetrator had a methodology, a weakness, a pattern that could be exploited.

The call came just before noon on Friday. Publicover’s phone, sitting on the desk between them, buzzed with the same jarring American sound. The caller ID was a London number she didn’t recognize, but she knew. She snatched it up, putting it on speaker. "Publicover."

The voice on the other end was strained, stripped of its usual professional nonchalance. It was Leo, the pathologist. "Eve. I got your package." He paused, and in the silence they could hear him take a long, shaky breath. "Listen, I ran the analysis you asked for. The protein profile. I ran it three times because the results didn't make any sense."

"And?" Publicover’s voice was flat, betraying nothing. Finch leaned forward, his hands gripping the edge of his desk, his knuckles white.

"And the primary protein is human," Leo said, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. The words landed in the musty office air with the force of a physical blow. Finch made a choked, retching sound and pushed his chair back violently, a wave of sickness washing over him. "But Eve, that's not… that's not the strangest part. The binding fats, the gelatin in the gravy… the bone meal in the pastry itself. It’s all from the same source. It’s a closed-loop system. Nothing is wasted." He paused again. "Whoever made this… this isn't just murder, Eve. This is husbandry."

The line went quiet. Husbandry. The word was a thousand times more obscene than murder. It implied farming, planning, a long-term, sustainable harvest. It was the word a farmer used for his livestock. Publicover’s eyes flicked to the board, to the names. Albright, Fenn, Gables, Long Timmy. The herd. "Thank you, Leo," she said, her voice like ice. "Delete this call. Forget we spoke. A formal report will follow through official channels on a different matter entirely." She ended the call and looked at Finch, who was pale and trembling, his face slick with sweat.

"It's true," he breathed, the confirmation somehow more devastating than the suspicion. "It's all true."

"Yes," Publicover said. "Now get on your feet, Sergeant. It's Friday." Finch stared at her, uncomprehending. "Friday," she repeated, her voice sharp as broken glass. "You told me the librarian, Eleanor Vance, gets her weekend pies delivered every Friday. We are no longer waiting for proof. We are intervening. Now." The command in her tone cut through his spiraling horror, replacing it with a jolt of pure adrenaline. Miss Vance. The gentle woman in the library. He scrambled for his jacket, the image of her smiling face burned into his mind, a lamb oblivious to the shadow of the butcher’s door.

They practically ran from the station, throwing themselves into Finch’s car. "She orders them," he said, his mind racing as he sped through the slick streets. "Ronda doesn't usually deliver. Eleanor is getting frail, so one of the library assistants, a young lad, usually nips out to fetch them for her around lunchtime."

"It's past lunchtime," Publicover noted, her eyes scanning every vehicle, every pedestrian. The ordinary Friday traffic of Upper Gristle now seemed charged with a terrible significance. "Did the assistant go?"

Finch’s blood ran cold. He hadn't thought of that. They were late. They might already be too late. He floored the accelerator, earning an angry honk from a passing delivery van. He ignored it, his focus narrowed to a single point: the library at the end of the square. As they screeched to a halt by the curb, he saw the library assistant, a teenager named Tom, locking his bike to the rack outside. He wasn't carrying the familiar gold and purple bag. Finch and Publicover exchanged a look of microscopic relief.

"I'll talk to him," Finch said, already out of the car. "You keep watch." He intercepted the boy at the library steps. "Tom! Just the lad I was looking for. Bit of a community policing question for you." He launched into a fabricated story about bicycle thefts, his mind working furiously to keep the boy talking, to keep him there, away from the buttery yellow shopfront that dominated the other side of the square.

From the corner of her eye, Publicover saw movement. It was not the flash of a car or the hurried step of a pedestrian. It was a slow, deliberate shifting of mass. A large, dark green van, the kind used by builders or tradesmen, had pulled into a parking space directly opposite the library. It was an old, slightly battered vehicle, unremarkable in every way except for the sheer size of the figure who unfolded from the driver's seat. It was Ronda. She wasn't wearing her pristine white apron. She was dressed in dark, practical work clothes. She moved to the back of the van, her movements economical and powerful, and opened the rear doors. From inside, she lifted a large, square cardboard box. She placed it on the pavement, then turned and looked directly at the library entrance, her gaze sweeping past Finch and the boy he was talking to. Her expression was unreadable from this distance, but Publicover felt the weight of her attention like a physical pressure. This was wrong. This was a deviation. Ronda didn't deliver.

"Finch," Publicover said into her collar mic, her voice low and urgent. "Change of plans. She's here. Green van. She has a package."

Ronda hefted the box with an ease that belied its apparent size and weight and started across the cobblestones towards the library. She moved with that same strange, fluid grace, a mountain gliding over the treacherous stones. The idyllic town square suddenly felt like a stage set for an ambush. Tourists and locals bustled past, utterly oblivious. Publicover's hand instinctively went to her jacket, to the cold, hard shape of the service weapon holstered beneath it. This was escalating far too quickly. They had no warrant, no backup, and no charge they could possibly make stick. All they had was a box. A box that might contain a week’s worth of chicken and leek pies. Or it might contain something else entirely.Finch, his mind a frantic scramble of protocol and terror, managed to steer the library assistant away with a stammering excuse about needing a witness statement for a non-existent fender-bender. He was a barrier of manufactured bureaucracy, a human shield made of red tape, and he positioned himself so that the boy’s back was to the unfolding drama in the square. Publicover moved, not with the aggressive stride of a cop making a bust, but with the calm, deliberate pace of a traffic warden. She intercepted Ronda in the middle of the cobblestones, a good twenty feet from the library doors, placing her much smaller body directly in the giantess’s path.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” Publicover said, her voice carrying clearly in the damp air. It was a textbook neutral tone, the one used a thousand times a day for minor infractions. Ronda stopped, her huge form eclipsing the weak afternoon sun. She looked down at Publicover, not with alarm, but with a mild, almost patronizing curiosity, as if a robin had landed on her shoe. The box in her arms was large and brown, sealed with packing tape.

“Inspector Publicover,” Ronda’s melodic soprano was as pleasant as ever. “Is there a problem?”

“That van,” Publicover gestured with her chin towards the green vehicle. “It matches the description of one we’re looking for in connection with a series of commercial burglaries in the district. I’ll need to see your license and the vehicle’s registration.” The lie was smooth, practiced. It was a legitimate reason to stop her, a hook to hang the entire confrontation on.

Ronda’s delicate Cupid’s bow mouth tightened into a thoughtful line. A flicker of something—annoyance, perhaps, or even amusement—passed through her dark eyes. “Of course, Inspector. My license is in the van. If you’ll just let me deliver this to Miss Vance, I’ll be happy to retrieve it for you.” She made to step around Publicover.

Publicover didn’t move. “The box will have to wait. What’s in it?”

“A delivery,” Ronda said, her voice acquiring a slight edge, the delicate chime of a bell beginning to crack. “Pies. For Miss Vance at the library. She’s an elderly customer. I wouldn’t want them to get cold.” The reasonableness of her tone made Publicover’s stance seem outrageous. A few passers-by were beginning to slow down, their curiosity piqued by the bizarre tableau of the tiny American cop and the colossal baker facing off in the middle of the square.

“I’m sure,” Publicover said, her eyes locked on the box. “Given the circumstances, I’m going to have to ask you to open it.”

At that moment, the library doors opened, and Eleanor Vance herself stepped out, a cardigan wrapped around her frail shoulders. “Tom? Is that you, dear? I was just wondering where my pies had gotten to.” She spotted the scene in the square, her brow furrowing in confusion. “Oh! Ronda, my dear. I didn’t expect you to come yourself. And Inspector Publicover. Is everything alright?”

Finch’s heart hammered against his ribs. The lamb had walked out to greet the wolf. He saw Ronda’s gaze shift to Miss Vance, and for a fleeting second, her placid mask slipped. A look of profound, predatory annoyance crossed her features, the look of a hunter whose kill is being threatened at the last moment. She recovered instantly, her face softening into a warm smile directed at the librarian. “Just a small misunderstanding, Eleanor. The Inspector is admiring my van.”

Publicover knew she had only seconds before the situation dissolved, before she would be forced to back down and look like a fool. She couldn’t force the box open. She couldn’t arrest Ronda. But she could contaminate the scene. She took a step forward, reaching out with a gloved hand and placing it firmly on the top of the cardboard box. “Ma’am, this vehicle is part of an active investigation. Which makes this package potential evidence.” She looked straight into Ronda’s small, dark eyes. “As such, it’s being confiscated for examination.”

The public challenge hung in the air, vibrating with unspoken meaning. Ronda could not protest without looking guilty. She could not refuse without escalating the situation in front of half the town, including the intended recipient of her ‘gift’. She was caught, not by law, but by the logic of the trap Publicover had laid. For a long moment, the two women stood frozen, locked in a silent battle of wills. Publicover’s hand on the box, Ronda’s massive arms holding it.

Then, slowly, a wide, dimpled smile spread across Ronda’s face. It was a terrifying sight, a smile of pure, cold intelligence that held no warmth and no humour. It was a smile of acknowledgement, of one grandmaster recognising a worthy move from her opponent. With a grace that was unnerving, she released her hold on the box, letting its full weight transfer to Publicover, who had to brace herself to take it. “Of course, Inspector,” Ronda said, her voice dripping with a sweet poison. “Anything to help the police with their hard work. Do let me know when you’re finished with it.” She turned to the confused librarian. “So sorry, Eleanor. It seems there’s been a bit of a mix-up. I’ll bake you a fresh batch for tomorrow.”

Without another word, Ronda turned and glided back to her van. She didn’t look back. She got in, started the engine with a low rumble, and drove away, leaving Publicover standing in the middle of the market square holding a large, heavy box that smelled faintly of chicken, leek, and something else. Something she did not want to name. Finch hurried over, his face ashen. “What’s in it?” he whispered, staring at the box as if it were a bomb.

“Our warrant,” Publicover said, her arms aching from the unexpected weight. “Let’s get this back to the station. And Sergeant,” she added, her voice dropping lower, “post a uniformed officer outside the library. Tell them it’s for observation after a spate of local burglaries. Miss Vance is not to be left alone.”The box was a dead weight, a coffin of cardboard and secrets that strained Publicover’s arms. The walk back to the car was the longest hundred feet of her life. She could feel the stares of the townspeople, a mixture of confusion and mild disapproval. Miss Vance looked heartbroken, as if her Friday treat had been snatched away by a callous bully. Finch, his face a blotchy mess of fear and resolve, muttered apologies and herded Publicover towards the car, running interference like a Secret Service agent protecting a dignitary. He opened the back door, and she carefully placed the box on the seat. The faint, buttery aroma of chicken and leek wafted from it, a scent so wholesome it felt like the deepest profanity.

The drive back to the station was conducted in a taut, humming silence. The car felt shrink-wrapped, the air thick with the unspoken. Finch’s hands were clamped so tight on the steering wheel his knuckles were bone-white. He drove too fast, his movements jerky, his eyes constantly checking the rearview mirror as if expecting the giant’s green van to reappear behind them, a land shark in their wake. Publicover didn’t look back. She stared straight ahead through the rain-streaked windscreen, her mind a cold, clear engine of logic. Ronda hadn’t been caught off guard. Her quick surrender, the placid smile, the casual offer of a "fresh batch"—that wasn't the behaviour of a panicked suspect. It was the calculated move of a player who had just sacrificed a pawn to set up a more devastating attack. The box was not an accident; it was a message.

They carried it into the station’s incident room like a holy relic, placing it in the centre of a large, stainless-steel examination table. The mundane office, with its scent of stale coffee and wet coats, felt instantly sanctified and desecrated by its presence. Finch stood back, breathing shallowly through his mouth, his revulsion palpable. Publicover pulled on a fresh pair of gloves, her movements precise. She picked up a sterile evidence knife, the kind used for cutting seatbelts at accident scenes, and paused for a fraction of a second. She met Finch’s wide, terrified eyes.

“Whatever is in here,” she said, her voice quiet but absolute, “she wanted us to find it. Remember that.” With a single, fluid motion, she sliced through the packing tape. The cardboard flaps sighed open. Inside, nestled in crisp, pleated paper cases, sat a dozen perfectly formed, exquisitely golden pies. The glaze on them shone under the fluorescent lights. A wisp of steam, trapped within the cardboard, curled into the air, carrying that rich, savoury scent. They looked, in a word, remarkable. For a dizzying moment, the sheer normality of it was disorienting. Finch let out a shaky breath, a sound of profound confusion. Had they been wrong? Was this all a colossal, career-ending bluff?

But Publicover was not looking at the pies. She was looking at the box itself. The way the pies were arranged, the depth of the cardboard. She ran a gloved finger along the inside edge. With a soft click, her nail found a seam that shouldn't have been there. She carefully lifted out one of the pies, its warmth radiating through her glove, and set it aside. Then she hooked her fingers under the edge of the paper lining and lifted. A false bottom, perfectly fitted, came away in her hand. The rich smell of pastry was instantly overwhelmed by the fainter, mustier scent of old wool and dust.

Beneath the platform that had held the pies was a small, neat compartment. In it, folded with an almost loving precision, was a dark green woolen jumper with the crest of St. Jude’s Primary embroidered on the chest. It was the kind of thing a teacher might wear on a chilly autumn day. And resting squarely in the centre of the folded garment, like a jewel on a velvet cushion, were a pair of simple, wire-framed spectacles. One of the lenses was fractured, a spiderweb of cracks radiating from a single point of impact. They were Arthur Albright’s glasses. It wasn’t just evidence; it was a curated display. A trophy. A taunt. It was Ronda, in her melodic soprano, saying, *You are too late for this one. And this is all you will ever have of him.*

Finch made a sound, a low, guttural moan of horror and grief. He stumbled forward, his hand outstretched as if to touch the spectacles, then recoiled as if from a hot stove. "His… that's his jumper," he whispered, his voice cracking. "He wore it every Thursday. Said it was his 'assembly uniform'." The personal detail, the small, humanising piece of a life now reduced to an exhibit in a cardboard box, seemed to break him. The abstract horror of the past forty-eight hours had just been given a face, a name, and a favourite jumper. It was real. All of it.

"She knew," Publicover said, her voice a low, dangerous hum. She was a coiled spring, all her methodical patience and intellectual analysis hardening into a diamond point of focused rage. "She knew we were watching. She switched the delivery. She let us stop her. She handed us this. This is her declaration of war." She stepped back from the table, stripping off her gloves with a snap of latex. The chess match was over. Ronda had just overturned the board.

Publicover strode to her desk and snatched up the receiver of her landline, her movements sharp and devoid of any hesitation. She dialled a number from memory, her eyes fixed on the damning contents of the box. Finch watched, his shock slowly giving way to a grim, cold fury. The town's beloved baker. Their Ronda. She hadn’t just killed these people; she had mocked them, consumed them, and then presented their last earthly remnants as a punchline to a joke only she understood. The delicate chime of her shop bell was the ringing of a dinner bell for a feast of souls.

"Chief Constable," Publicover's voice was stripped of all niceties, a blade of pure, compressed purpose. "This is Detective Inspector Evelyn Publicover, Upper Gristle. The forensic analysis on the Albright sample has been confirmed by my contact. It's human. Furthermore, we have just recovered the victim's personal effects from the suspect. She delivered them to us herself. I am formally requesting an immediate, no-knock warrant for the premises of Ronda's Remarkable Pies on the market square, and for the personal residence of the proprietor, a woman known only as Ronda. And sir," she paused, her gaze locking with Finch's across the room, "given the suspect's unusual physical characteristics and the nature of the crimes, I'm requesting a full Armed Response Unit. We're going in. Tonight."The silence on the other end of the line was a chasm. For a full five seconds, the Chief Constable of the county constabulary, a man whose career had been built on a foundation of unflappable calm, said nothing. Publicover could hear the faint, distant sound of traffic through his office window, a reminder of a normal world that no longer felt real. When he finally spoke, his voice was tight, a wire drawn taut. "Inspector, I need you to repeat the primary finding from your confidential informant. For the record that I am about to start making." He wasn't doubting her; he was calibrating the scale of the impending cataclysm. He was building the first wall of his own defence for the political and media firestorm that was about to be unleashed.

"The primary protein source in the foodstuff recovered from Sergeant Finch, which originated from the suspect's establishment, is human, sir," Publicover stated, her voice as flat and hard as slate. "The analysis further suggests that multiple parts of the same source were used in the preparation, indicating a practice of 'total use'. The spectacles and jumper belonging to the missing person, Arthur Albright, were then delivered to us by the suspect herself in a box of pastries. She is aware of our investigation and is actively mocking it. She is a clear and present danger." Her words were bullets, each one striking home. Another beat of silence, then a resigned, weary sigh that seemed to carry the weight of his entire career. "The warrant is granted, Inspector. On my authority. The Armed Response Unit is staging at the motorway services at Junction 12. Their commander will be liaising with you in thirty minutes. God help us all if you're wrong. And God help us even more if you're right."

The thirty minutes that followed transformed the sleepy Upper Gristle station house from a musty backwater into the nerve centre of a military operation. The languid rhythm of small-town policing was shattered. Finch, his earlier horror now calcified into a diamond-hard resolve, worked with a frantic energy he hadn't possessed in twenty years. He unrolled yellowed blueprints of the market square, a relic from a planning dispute in the 1980s, pointing out the layout of the pie shop to Publicover. He detailed the narrow alley that ran behind it, the shared wall with the antique shop, the weak points of the old building. He was no longer a rumpled cardigan; he was a field guide to a hunting ground he had, until today, called home. His hands shook, not with fear anymore, but with a righteous, furious energy. The pie shop, a place he'd visited for a weekly treat, was now a target to be mapped and breached.

The arrival of the ARU was not a screaming of sirens, but a quiet, dark tide creeping into the town. Two heavy, unmarked black vans glided into the station's car park, their engines cutting out with a soft diesel sigh. Men disembarked, not with the casual manner of beat cops, but with the coiled, economic movements of trained predators. They were clad in black, their forms bulky with body armour, their faces obscured by helmets and visors. The matte black finish of their carbines seemed to drink the weak light from the drizzling sky. They were an alien species on the ancient cobblestones, avatars of modern violence come to a place that measured time in centuries. The people of Upper Gristle slept on, dreaming of mundane things, utterly unaware that an army had just occupied their town square.

Publicover met the team’s commander, a short, brutally compact man named Chief Inspector Davies, in the incident room. The box with Albright’s pathetic remains sat on the table between them, a silent, damning testament. Davies’s eyes, visible through his raised visor, were chips of grey flint. He listened without interruption as Publicover delivered a stripped-down, brutally efficient briefing. She did not mention folklore or fairy tales. She spoke of tactical realities. "The target is a female named Ronda. She is a giant, and that is not an exaggeration. Height is estimated at seven feet, with commensurate mass and strength. Do not be deceived by her gender or age. Consider her to be a hostile of extreme physical capability. The primary entry point will be the front of the shop. A secondary team will cover the rear alley. The building is old, timber-framed. The flat above the shop is her residence. We do not know the layout of the basement, but given the nature of the operation, assume it is of critical importance. This is not just an apprehension. This is a recovery. The entire premises, from the rafters to the foundations, is a crime scene."

Finch stepped forward, tapping the blueprints. "The walls are wattle and daub behind the brick facade," he added, his voice low and steady. "Thick, but not reinforced. The cellar access, if it's the original design, will be a trapdoor behind the main counter. Heavy oak. Bolted from above." His local knowledge was their most valuable intelligence. Davies nodded once, his flinty eyes taking in every detail. He looked at Publicover, then at Finch. He had seen fear, panic, and bravado in his line of work. He saw something different here: a chilling certainty. "My team will be ready in five," he said, turning to leave. "We breach on your signal, Inspector."

The final moments before the strike were a symphony of silence and rain. Publicover and Finch stood in the deep shadow of the town hall, looking across the empty market square. The buttery yellow of Ronda’s shopfront seemed to glow with a sick, false innocence under the sodium lamps. A single light burned in the window of the flat upstairs. She was awake. She was waiting. The whole square was a theatre, and the curtain was about to rise. Finch’s heart was a frantic drum against his ribs, but his hands were steady. He thought of Long Timmy and his bottle caps, of Arthur Albright and his Thursday jumper. Publicover stood beside him, a statue of purpose. She was an outsider, an antibody introduced into the sick body of Upper Gristle, and she was about to trigger the fever that would burn out the infection. She raised a small radio to her lips, her eyes never leaving the yellow door. She saw the dark shapes of the ARU team melt into the doorways opposite the shop. She took one last breath of the damp, cold English air, a chill that promised mildew and secrets. And this time, it was a promise she intended to keep. "All units, stand by," she said, her voice a calm whisper in the night. "Execute on my mark. Three… Two… One… Strike."The word “Strike” was not a shout. It was a puncture. It broke the wet, silent skin of the night, and in the space of a single heartbeat, the market square erupted. A muffled, percussive *thump* as the enforcer struck the buttery yellow door was followed by the violent crash of the front display window imploding. Shards of glass, glittering like sugar in the sodium lamps, sprayed across the cobblestones, mingling with the ruins of a pyramid of pies. Dark, heavily armoured shapes flowed through the newly created openings with a brutal, liquid efficiency, disappearing into the blackness of the shop’s interior.

From their position across the square, Publicover and Finch watched the raid unfold with a strange sense of detachment, like seeing a film of their own lives. They could hear the clipped, professional shouts from within, the sound of boots on floorboards, another crash from the rear of the building as the second team went in. A light flashed on in the upstairs flat, then another, as the teams swept through the building. The entire operation, from breach to the first situation report, took less than ninety seconds. Davies’ voice, tinny and calm, crackled over Publicover’s radio. "Ground floor is clear. Negative contact." A moment later, another voice. "First floor flat is clear. Negative contact."

The silence that followed was more unnerving than the violence of the breach. She was gone. Publicover and Finch moved, jogging across the damp stones, the soles of their shoes crunching on shattered glass. Inside, the pie shop was a scene of controlled chaos. The air hung thick with the smell of pastry, cordite, and the damp night air. Overturned tables and shattered display cases littered the floor, but beneath the debris, the floorboards were still unnervingly, spotlessly clean. Finch moved instinctively towards the main counter, his flashlight beam cutting through the gloom and landing on the heavy, iron-ringed trapdoor set flush with the floor. It was exactly as he’d described.

Davies met them, his visor raised. His face was impassive, but his eyes betrayed a grim tension. “The place is empty, Inspector. The bed upstairs is made. The wardrobe is full of clothes. It’s like she just stepped out for a pint of milk.” He gestured to the trapdoor. “That’s the only place left.” Two of his men were already working on it with a heavy pry bar. The old oak groaned in protest, the sound of a coffin being opened. With a final, splintering crack, they heaved the heavy door open, revealing a set of steep stone steps descending into absolute blackness. And from that blackness, a smell rolled up to meet them. It was the smell of the shop, the rich, meaty, herbal perfume of the pies, but it was underpinned by something else. A darker, copper-penny tang. The cloying, metallic scent of a slaughterhouse.

Davies and two of his men descended first, their weapon lights cutting sharp, white cones into the darkness. Publicover and Finch followed, their own flashlight beams dancing over the walls. The basement was not the damp, dusty cellar of a centuries-old building. It was a modern, industrial abattoir, rendered in gleaming stainless steel and cold, scrubbed stone. The floor sloped gently towards a large central drain. A row of hooks, sharpened to vicious points, hung from a steel rack on the ceiling. Against one wall was a butcher’s block the size of a small car, its surface scoured but still showing the faint shadows of deep stains. Beside it, an array of immense, custom-made cleavers, saws, and knives hung in perfect order on a magnetic strip, each one honed to a terrifying gleam. An enormous, cast-iron oven, big enough to roast an ox whole, dominated the far wall, a faint warmth still radiating from its closed door. This was not a kitchen. It was a processing plant.

One of the ARU officers moved cautiously towards a heavy, walk-in freezer door. He pulled the large latch handle, and the door swung open with a hiss of cold air. His flashlight beam played over the contents, and he swore, a sharp, choked exhalation. The freezer was lined with shelves, and on those shelves were dozens of neatly wrapped white butcher-paper packages, each one tied with string and marked with a small, handwritten tag. The officer read one out, his voice strained. “H. Fenn. Nov. ‘19.” He moved his light. “B. Gables. May ‘21.” Finch felt the floor tilt beneath his feet. It was an ossuary disguised as a larder. A meticulously catalogued inventory of the town’s forgotten souls. But the most recent acquisitions, Arthur Albright and Long Timmy, were not there.

Publicover’s mind was racing, the pieces clicking into a new and far more horrifying configuration. The empty flat. The waiting oven. The catalogued remains. This was a place of work, but the work was finished, for now. The taunt with the box, the jumper, the glasses—it wasn’t a declaration of war. It was a diversion. It was Ronda, the master strategist, moving her queen to draw all of their pieces to one side of the board, leaving the other side fatally exposed. Her parting words to Eleanor Vance echoed in Publicover’s head, no longer a pleasantry but a chilling statement of intent. *I’ll bake you a fresh batch for tomorrow.*

"She's not here," Davies said, confirming the obvious, his voice tight with a terrible understanding. "She led us here. She wanted us to find this. She drew every available officer in the district to this spot. Why?" The question hung in the cold, blood-scented air. Publicover didn't need to answer. She was already snatching the radio from her belt, her heart a block of ice in her chest. The officer she had posted at the library, a single, uniformed lamb to guard the fold. It wasn't enough. It was nothing.

Before she could speak, the radio crackled to life, a desperate, panicked voice cutting through the static. It was PC Cartwright, the young constable at the library. "Control! This is Cartwright, at the library! Someone’s in here! The back door's been smashed in! I-I can't get to Miss Vance, her flat door is blocked! I hear something… oh God, what is that sound?" His transmission was broken by a noise, faint but clear over the radio. It wasn't shouting. It wasn't a struggle. It was singing. A breathy, melodic soprano, humming a gentle, tuneless lullaby.

"All units, disengage!" Publicover’s voice was a raw, desperate roar that echoed in the stone cellar. "Suspect is not at the primary location! She is at the library on the town square! Repeat, all units to the library, now!" Without waiting for a response, she turned and scrambled up the stone steps, shoving past a bewildered-looking Finch. The hunt was not over. The monster was not in her lair. She was in the nursery.The sprint across the square was a nightmare of burning lungs and slipping feet. The rain, which had been a constant, passive presence, now felt malevolent, driving into their faces and turning the ancient cobblestones into a treacherous, slick trap. The buttery yellow of the pie shop, now a gaping black wound, receded behind them as the library loomed ahead, a bastion of quiet knowledge that had been violently breached. The back door, a heavy oak affair meant to last another century, had been splintered from its frame, hanging drunkenly on one hinge. The wood was shattered inwards, a testament to a force that did not bother with locks.

They plunged into the darkness of the library’s back office, the smell of old paper and bookbinding glue thick in the air. The emergency lights cast a sickly green pall over everything, making the familiar space feel alien and threatening. The path to the main stairwell was blocked. A massive, steel four-drawer filing cabinet, something that would have taken four strong men to move, had been dragged from a wall and thrown on its side, completely obstructing the corridor. It was an act of casual, contemptuous strength. Publicover saw the scuff marks on the floor, the deep gouges in the linoleum. This was the work of the giant. This was how she had trapped the young constable.

Davies and his team were seconds behind them, their heavy boots thundering on the floor. "Hydraulic spreader!" he barked, and two of his men immediately moved forward with a heavy piece of equipment. As they worked to pry the cabinet from the doorway, the sound returned. The singing. It was louder now, closer, drifting down from the top of the stairs. It was a soft, lilting hum, a nursery rhyme without words, the kind of sound a mother might make to soothe a sleeping child. It was the most terrifying sound Publicover had ever heard. It was the sound of possession, of ownership, of a predator crooning over its meal. Finch’s face, illuminated in the strobing lights of the ARU's equipment, was a mask of pure agony. He knew that sound was the last thing Eleanor Vance would ever hear.

With a groan of tortured metal, the cabinet shifted, and the team forced a gap wide enough to squeeze through. "Go!" Davies yelled, and Publicover and Finch scrambled past, taking the stairs two at a time, their weapons drawn. The door to Eleanor Vance’s flat was ajar. It, too, had been brutalised, the lock punched clean through the wood. The singing had stopped. The silence that replaced it was vast and absolute, a vacuum where all hope had died. Publicover pushed the door open, her movements tight and controlled, every nerve screaming.

The small, cozy living room was in chaos. Books had been swept from shelves, a small table was overturned, and in the centre of the room lay the broken form of PC Cartwright. He was unconscious, his head bleeding from a nasty gush where it had impacted the wall, but a faint flutter of movement at his chest showed he was still breathing. He had been tossed aside like a doll, a minor inconvenience. But the flat was otherwise empty. The predator and her prey were not here. A short hallway led deeper into the flat, towards the kitchen. A single, perfect drop of blood, dark and viscous, stained the runner on the floor.

Publicover moved down the hall, Finch a half-step behind her, his breathing ragged. As they reached the kitchen doorway, they froze. The scene before them was a tableau from a madman’s opera. The kitchen was small and tidy, with cheerful blue tiles and pots of herbs on the windowsill. And in the centre of it stood Ronda. She had Eleanor Vance, the small, bird-like librarian, held fast in the crook of one enormous arm. Eleanor was conscious, her eyes wide with a terror so profound it had gone past screaming into a state of frozen, catatonic shock. Ronda had one of her pristine white aprons tied over her dark work clothes, and in her free hand, she held a long, slender boning knife, its tip resting with surgical precision against the soft flesh of Eleanor’s throat. She was not panicked. She was not angry. She looked at them with an expression of deep and profound disappointment, as if they had tracked mud all over her clean floor.

"Really, Inspector," Ronda's melodic soprano filled the small room, a sound of grotesque civility. "You are spoiling the entire evening. This part is a delicate process. It requires a calm environment." She adjusted her grip on Eleanor slightly, and the librarian let out a tiny, whimpering sound. The ARU team crowded the hallway behind Publicover, the red dots of their laser sights dancing like angry fireflies on Ronda's massive chest. They had a clear shot, but with the knife at Eleanor's throat, they were frozen.

"Let her go, Ronda," Publicover said, her voice steady, her weapon held low but ready. She took a small step into the room, drawing the giant’s focus.

Ronda laughed, a sound like tiny, silver bells. It was a genuine laugh, full of amusement. "Let her go? My dear woman, you don't 'let go' of the harvest. You gather it. This is the way of things. The strong feed. The weak… nourish." Her small, dark eyes shone with an ancient, unassailable logic. "You eat your cattle, your pigs, your lambs. You pen them, you fatten them, you lead them to the slaughter. How is this any different? I am simply more selective. I prefer my stock to be… literate." A dimpled smile touched her lips. "They have richer stories."

Finch made a choked, furious sound, a noise of pure rage. "She's not livestock! She's my friend!" he roared, taking an involuntary step forward.

Ronda’s eyes snapped to him, and the amusement vanished, replaced by cold contempt. "Friendship," she scoffed. "A temporary arrangement of mutual convenience. A story you tell yourselves to keep the darkness at bay. But the darkness is always there, Sergeant. It is hungry." Her gaze swept over him, and a flicker of something like culinary appraisal entered her eyes. "And some stories," she added, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, "are more satisfying than others. You, for instance. You enjoyed my work."

The personal, intimate cruelty of the remark struck Finch like a physical blow. He staggered back a step, the memory of the pie, the rich flavour, rising in his throat like bile. Publicover saw her chance. Ronda was distracted, gloating, her entire focus on the man she had so successfully violated. Publicover took another slow, deliberate step into the kitchen, making herself the primary target, the centre of the giant's world. "You're right," she said, her voice a low, challenging purr. "It's all just a story. But you've forgotten how this one ends. The giant always falls. It's historically significant."

She used the words deliberately. Arthur Albright's words. The last words he had ever spoken to her. For a split second, Ronda's composure cracked. Her eyes widened, the mask of amused superiority slipping to reveal a flash of pure, primal fury. It was the insult she could not tolerate, the suggestion that she was just another cliché, a character in a children's book, subject to the same inevitable, ignominious end. Her head snapped toward Publicover, the knife at Eleanor's throat wavering for a fraction of an inch as her attention shifted entirely to the American detective.

It was the opening Finch needed. He was not a marksman. He was not a soldier. He was a small-town policeman whose world had been torn apart. He was running on grief, rage, and the phantom taste of human flesh. He raised his standard-issue Glock, his hands surprisingly steady, and in the space between one frantic heartbeat and the next, he fired. The shot was a deafening crack in the small kitchen. It did not strike her head or her heart. It struck the massive bicep of the arm holding the knife. Ronda roared, a sound that was not human, a bellow of pure shock and animal pain that vibrated through the floorboards. The boning knife clattered to the tiled floor. Her arm spasmed, her grip on Eleanor loosened, and the small librarian crumpled to the ground, sobbing. The spell was broken. In the next instant, the ARU team surged forward, a black wave of controlled violence, swarming the wounded, roaring giant and bringing her down under a sheer weight of numbers and tactical force. Finch stood in the doorway, the pistol smoking in his hand, his ears ringing, staring at the fallen monster on the floor of his friend's kitchen, the story finally, blessedly, at an end.The pandemonium in the aftermath was a silent one. The ringing in Finch's ears from the gunshot slowly subsided, replaced by a thick, pressing quiet broken only by the ragged sobbing of Eleanor Vance and the clipped, professional murmurs of the ARU team. They moved with brutal efficiency, securing Ronda with heavy-duty restraints designed for violent psychiatric patients, their black-clad forms a stark contrast to the cheerful blue tiles of the librarian’s kitchen. Ronda did not fight them. She did not roar or scream. She lay on the floor, a fallen colossus, and watched them work with an unnerving, placid stillness. The only sign of the fury she had shown moments before was in her eyes. The small, dark eyes that had once seemed welcoming and analytical were now black pits of pure, undiluted hatred, fixed on Finch with a terrible, possessive intensity. They were the eyes of a deity whose temple had been defiled by a mortal, promising a damnation that went far beyond mere death.

Finch stood trembling, not from fear, but from the violent adrenaline crash. He lowered the pistol, his hand feeling numb and disconnected from his body. It felt impossibly heavy, a talisman of a world he had never wanted to enter. He had shot a person. No, he had shot a monster, and in doing so, had saved his friend. He looked from the smoking gun in his hand to Eleanor, who was being gently helped to her feet by a medic who had appeared as if from nowhere. Her eyes were vacant with shock, but she was alive. She was alive. The thought was a small, flickering candle in the vast, roaring darkness of what he had just done, what he had just learned, what he had almost become. Publicover moved to his side, her presence a solid, calming weight. She didn't speak, but simply placed a firm hand on his shoulder, a silent acknowledgement that was more profound than any words of praise. It was the gesture of a commanding officer to a soldier who had held the line.

Getting Ronda out of the library was a logistical and psychological nightmare. She refused to walk, forcing four burly ARU officers to half-carry, half-drag her immense, deadweight form down the stairs and through the violated back rooms. Davies, his face grim, coordinated the extraction with the grim efficiency of a man managing a disaster. They had commandeered a large police transport van, normally used for crowd control, and backed it as close as they could to the library doors. The decision was made to move her immediately, in the murky pre-dawn gloom, before the town fully awoke to the horror in its heart. As they manhandled her across the last few feet of the town square, the first lights began to flicker on in the windows above the shops. Faces appeared, drawn by the commotion, their expressions of sleepy curiosity morphing into slack-jawed disbelief. The postman, just starting his round, stood frozen, his mail sack slipping from his shoulder. The elderly woman from Weaver’s Lane, who had praised Ronda’s ‘divine’ pies, stared from her bedroom window, her hand covering her mouth. They were watching a myth die, watching the warm, comforting heart of their town being dragged away in chains, revealed as the ravenous maw that had been secretly devouring them all along.

Publicover watched the townsfolk watch the monster, and a profound, desolate sadness settled over her. This was her victory. She had been right. She had pulled at the thread and unravelled the entire, blood-soaked tapestry. But there was no triumph in it. She saw in their faces the dawning of a collective trauma from which Upper Gristle would never truly recover. Every cherished memory of a warm pie on a cold day was now tainted, every village fête she had catered, every kind word she had spoken, twisted into a grotesque parody. The charm had been a weapon, the pies a delivery system for a horror older than the cobblestones. The dampness and the secrets. The secret was out now, a screaming, raw thing laid bare in the middle of their perfect English postcard. It would seep into the town’s marrow, a new chill that no amount of sunshine would ever truly bake away.

Back at the station, the world began to intrude. The Chief Constable had been on the line, his voice a strained mixture of shock, awe, and bureaucratic panic. The national news outlets had somehow gotten wind of a major police incident in a sleepy English town and were already dispatching reporters. The phone on Finch’s desk began to ring, and it was clear it would not stop ringing for days, weeks, maybe years. Finch himself had gone with Eleanor to the hospital, reverting to his role as a familiar, comforting presence, a small anchor for her in a world that had come completely unmoored. Publicover was left alone in the incident room, the epicentre of the earthquake. She stood before the whiteboard, at the names—Albright, Fenn, Gables, Long Timmy—and with a heavy hand, she drew a line through each of them. Not closing the case, but marking the end of the hunt. Her exchange was over. She would have to write a report, a document that would read more like a medieval bestiary than a police procedural. Then she would go home to the honest, dry-ice winters of Maine, and try to forget the feel of a dampness that got into your bones, and the melodic, soprano voice of the woman who had turned a town into her own private larder. The rain, for the first time in weeks, had finally stopped. The bruised flannel sky was beginning to bleed a pale, watery grey. It was the colour of mourning.The new day arrived not with a sense of renewal, but with the flat, clinical light of a post-mortem. Publicover stood alone in the incident room, a styrofoam cup of acrid, instant coffee—procured from a machine that had clearly not been cleaned since the Thatcher years—in her hand. The whiteboard was a battlefield map after the fighting had stopped. The names, scored through with black marker, seemed more like gravestones than case notes. The silence in the station was a fragile skin stretched over a screaming void. Outside, the world was waking up, but Upper Gristle was waking into a nightmare from which there was no escape. She had done her job. She had found the missing person, identified the perpetrator, and stopped the killing. But it felt less like a victory and more like she had diagnosed a terminal illness, leaving the patient to deal with the slow, agonizing decay.

Finch returned near mid-morning, looking like a man who had been hollowed out from the inside. The rumpled comfort of his cardigan was gone, replaced by the deep, structural creases of a soul that had been wrung dry. He moved slowly, his shoulders stooped under a new, invisible weight. He poured himself a coffee from the same foul machine and stood beside her, staring at the board. For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The shared horror was a third presence in the room.

"Eleanor's stable," he said finally, his voice a dry rasp. "Physically, anyway. They have her sedated. She just keeps whispering. Over and over. 'He was singing to me.' Not she. He. I think… I think in her mind, the song was the only thing that made sense, so she gave it to an angel." He rubbed a hand over his face, the sound like sandpaper. "They're calling it the 'Upper Gristle Cannibal Case' on the radio. They're saying we're heroes." He let out a short, sharp breath that was almost a sob. "It doesn't feel like heroism, Eve. It feels like we just confirmed the monster under the bed is real, and then we left every child in the world to stare into the darkness, knowing."

The official summons came an hour later. Ronda had been transferred to a high-security detention facility in a featureless industrial park halfway to London, a place of grey concrete and mirrored glass designed to hold terrorists and spies. It was a non-place, a blank spot on the map, and it was there that they would conduct the formal interview. The drive was silent, the English countryside rolling past the windows, a panorama of green fields and ancient trees that now seemed to hide a multitude of sins. Publicover drove, her focus absolute. Finch stared out the window, his reflection a pale, haunted ghost superimposed over the idyllic scenery. He was seeing the faces of the people he'd known his whole life, wondering which of them had praised the steak and kidney, which of them had savoured the lamb and rosemary, which of them had unknowingly consumed their neighbours.

The interview room was a cube of pale grey, designed to offer no comfort and no distraction. A single, heavy steel table was bolted to the floor, with two chairs on one side and one on the other. Ronda was already seated when they entered, flanked by two guards who dwarfed normal men but looked like children next to her. She was dressed in a standard-issue grey tracksuit that fit her like sausage casing. Her immense hands, scrubbed clean, were cuffed to a heavy iron ring in the centre of the table. The physical threat was gone, neutralized by steel and concrete, but her presence still dominated the room, sucking the air from it. She looked up as they entered, and a small, dimpled smile touched her lips.

"Inspector. Sergeant," her melodic soprano was utterly unchanged, as incongruous as a birdsong in a morgue. "So glad you could make it. I was worried you might be too busy with the paperwork. There must be an awful lot of it." She gestured with a slight tilt of her head to the chairs. "Please, sit. It's so rare I get to entertain."

Publicover sat, placing a digital recorder on the table. She began the interview with the formulaic recitation of rights and cautions, her voice a monotone. Ronda listened with polite attention, as if hearing the rules of a quaint parlour game. When Publicover was finished, Ronda’s smile widened. "Now that the tiresome formalities are out of the way," she said, her dark eyes twinkling. "To what do I owe the pleasure? Have you come for the recipe?"

Finch, who had been sitting rigid with barely suppressed rage, made an involuntary growling noise. Ronda’s gaze slid to him, and her expression softened into one of mock sympathy. "Oh, Alistair. You really mustn't take it so personally. You were an excellent customer. Discerning. You appreciated the quality of the ingredients, the time that went into the preparation. That's all any true artisan can ever ask for. You should think of it as a compliment."

"They were people," Finch choked out, his voice thick with revulsion. "They were my friends."

"They were ingredients," Ronda corrected him gently, as if explaining a simple concept to a child. "Everything is, eventually. The sheep eats the grass, the wolf eats the sheep, the man eats the wolf when he is hungry enough. The soil eats us all in the end. It's the great, glorious cycle of consumption. All I did was refine the process. I elevated it. I took lonely, wasted lives and turned them into something remarkable. Something that brought joy, and comfort, and warmth. Did Arthur Albright ever bring as much happiness to this town with his dusty books as he did in his final form, as a perfectly executed lamb and rosemary pie on a cold Tuesday night? I think not." Her logic was a polished, flawless circle of insanity, and there was no way in.

Publicover cut through the philosophical horror with a cold, sharp question. "How many, Ronda? How many since you came to Upper Gristle?"

Ronda’s eyes shifted to Publicover, appraising her. "You are not like him, Inspector. You have no sentiment. You're a butcher, not a gourmet. You only want to count the cuts of meat." She leaned forward as far as her cuffs would allow, her voice dropping to a confidential murmur. "I don't keep a tally. Does a baker count the grains of flour she uses? It's all just pantry stock. Some you use, some you save. I am, above all things, a practical woman. I abhor waste." She settled back in her chair. "This is a family tradition, you know. A very old one. My grandmother taught me the basics, of course. She had her own little parish, further down in Devon. People there still talk about her magnificent soups. But the pastry… the crust was my own innovation. My contribution to the craft." Her gaze lingered on Publicover, a strange, speculative light in her eyes. "You have the bones for it, Inspector. Good, strong bones. You would make a very robust stock."The insult, so grotesque and intimate, hung in the sterile air of the room. Finch visibly recoiled, a man gut-punched by a memory. Publicover, however, did not flinch. She did not register disgust or fear. She simply tilted her head, a gesture of mild, academic curiosity, her gaze fixed on Ronda’s face. The silence stretched, and in that silence, the power dynamic in the room began to shift. Ronda had expected a gasp, a tremor of fear, a confirmation of her power to disturb. She received nothing but calm, analytical appraisal.

“A robust stock,” Publicover repeated, her voice a low, even murmur. She leaned forward, mirroring Ronda’s earlier movement, her elbows resting on the cold steel of the table. “You see bones, and you see stock. You see a man, and you see a pie. You think this philosophy of yours is grand, don’t you? This great, glorious cycle. You see yourself as a wolf, a force of nature culling the herd. But you’ve misread the whole story, Ronda. You’re not the wolf.”

Ronda’s smile tightened at the edges, the first sign of a crack in the placid facade. She said nothing, waiting.

“A wolf hunts,” Publicover continued, her voice never rising, yet it cut through the room like a shard of ice. “It faces its prey. It risks injury. It is a part of the wilderness it inhabits. You? You hide. You hide in sleepy villages where no one asks questions. You hide behind a charming shopfront and a warm smile. You don’t hunt the strong; you pick off the weak, the lonely, the ones you know won’t be missed. The archivist with no family, the widow whose sister is on the other side of the planet, the simple-minded boy that society had already discarded. You’re not a wolf, Ronda. You’re a bottom-feeder. A parasite that has to disguise its nature to survive.”

The words landed like stones. The twinkling, theatrical light in Ronda’s eyes died, replaced by a flat, cold stillness. The artist had been called a hack. The philosopher had been called a coward. Publicover pressed her advantage, her voice relentless.

“My tradition, the one you so clearly misunderstand, teaches you to break your enemy, to dismantle them. It doesn't teach you to sneak into their homes and bake them into a casserole. That’s not a tradition. It's a pathology. It’s the act of a creature so profoundly weak it has to turn its victims into comfort food to feel strong. You don’t consume your enemies to gain their power; you do it because you are terrified of them when they are alive and breathing. You’re not a chef, you’re a scavenger with a flair for presentation.”

For the first time since they had met her, Ronda looked truly shaken. Her immense pride, the bedrock of her entire existence, was being systematically dismantled. She had been prepared for moral outrage, for legal threats, for fear and disgust. She had not been prepared for contempt. She had not been prepared to be seen, not as a magnificent monster, but as something small, and frightened, and pathetic.

It was in that moment that something shifted in Alistair Finch. He looked at the giant sitting opposite him, at the wounded pride in her eyes, and he saw what Publicover had done. She had taken the monster’s grand, self-aggrandizing narrative and ripped it to shreds. She had refused to play its game. And in that refusal, she had given him back a weapon he thought he had lost forever. He straightened in his chair, the slump of the victim falling away from his shoulders. He met Ronda’s gaze, and when he spoke, his voice was quiet, clear, and utterly devastating.

“She’s right,” he said. He saw the flicker of surprise on Ronda’s face, the slight turn of her head towards him. “You talked about my discerning palate. How I appreciated your work.” He gave a small, dismissive shrug. “It was just a pie. And honestly? I’ve had better. The crust was a bit greasy. A little heavy on the thyme.” He leaned back in his chair, a man delivering a casual food review. “For all the talk, for all the special ingredients… it was, in the end, forgettable.”

The blow was perfect. It was not a moral judgment she could scoff at or a threat she could dismiss. It was a critique of her art, her life’s work, her entire reason for being. It relegated her from a culinary goddess to a mediocre cook. The last vestiges of Ronda’s composure crumbled. A deep, dark flush crept up from the collar of her grey tracksuit, staining her pale, doughy flesh. Her Cupid’s bow mouth was a thin, white line of fury. She had terrorized this man, fed him his own people, violated him on a primal level, and his final verdict was that her pie was just… average. He had taken her horror and rendered it bland.

Publicover watched the transformation, then coolly reached forward and switched off the digital recorder. The soft click was a final, punctuating sound. “I believe we’re done here,” she said, rising from her chair. She looked down at the monstrous, defeated woman cuffed to the table. The giant was gone. All that was left was a killer in a cheap tracksuit, stripped of her story, left with nothing but the vulgar, pathetic truth of her crimes. Publicover and Finch turned and walked out of the room, leaving Ronda sitting in a silence that was no longer her own, but one that had been imposed upon her, as cold and grey and empty as the room itself.The drive back from the detention facility was the quietest yet. It was not the taut, fearful silence of the journey there, but the vast, empty quiet that follows a colossal explosion. The air in the car felt thin, as if all the oxygen had been consumed by the inferno of the confrontation. Finch drove this time, his hands resting lightly on the wheel. The death-grip was gone. He navigated the winding country lanes with a placid competence, his gaze on the road ahead, but his mind clearly somewhere else entirely. After a long while, he spoke, his voice low and even, the rasp of trauma replaced by a profound weariness.

“You didn’t just arrest her, did you?” he said, not looking at Publicover. “In that room. You skinned her. You took away her story, and you left her with nothing but the ugly facts. I thought… I thought the only way to beat something like that was with guns and cuffs. But you did it with words.”

“She lives on her own narrative,” Publicover replied, watching the blur of green fields. “It’s her primary source of strength. Taking away her freedom is a logistical problem for her. Taking away her myth is an existential threat. You can’t cage a god, but you can convince it that no one believes in it anymore. And a god without believers is just a story someone forgot to tell.”

Finch nodded slowly, a deep understanding dawning in his eyes. “And I took away her craft.” A small, grim smile touched his lips for the first time. It didn’t reach his eyes, but it was a start. “'Forgettable.' I think that one word did more damage than the bullet.” He was quiet for another mile, then added, “Thank you, Eve. For showing me that.” It was the first time he had used her given name.

A week later, the circus had moved on. The satellite vans had vanished from the market square, the reporters had found a new, fresher horror to report on, and Upper Gristle had been left to its grief. A quiet, permanent pall had settled over the town. The buttery yellow shopfront had been boarded up, its cheerful colour a mocking reminder. People spoke in hushed tones. No one made jokes about pies anymore. A makeshift memorial of flowers and rain-soaked teddy bears had sprung up outside the library, a tribute not just to Arthur Albright and the others, but to an innocence the town would never know again. The dampness had finally won, seeping into the very foundations of their collective memory.

Publicover stood in her rented flat, surrounded by the cardboard boxes that marked the end of her tour. The last item to pack was her waxed jacket, still faintly clammy to the touch. She held it for a moment, the physical embodiment of her time here. It smelled of rain, and damp earth, and secrets. She folded it neatly and placed it in the box. A knock at the door startled her. It was Finch. He wasn’t wearing his cardigan. He was in a newer, sharper tweed jacket, a man trying on a new skin. In his hands, he held a small, awkwardly wrapped parcel.

“Thought I’d see you off,” he said, stepping inside. “Heard you were flying out this afternoon.” He looked around the bare room. “Doesn’t look like you’re leaving much of a footprint.”

“That’s the idea,” she said. “Travel light.” They stood in the slightly awkward silence of a partnership that had run its course. The intense, life-or-death intimacy they had shared was already receding, leaving the more formal shape of their professional relationship. “How’s Eleanor?” she asked.

“Getting there,” he said. “She’s with her sister now, down in Cornwall. The sea air will do her good. She… she asked me to give you this.” He handed her the parcel. Publicover unwrapped it. It was a book, a small, leather-bound first edition of *Moby Dick*. Tucked inside the cover was a note in a frail, spidery hand. *For the Inspector. Sometimes you have to hunt the whale. Thank you. E. Vance.*

Publicover ran a gloved finger over the embossed title on the cover, a small, unreadable expression on her face. “A book about a man consumed by a monster. Fitting.”

“She has a sense of humour,” Finch said. “A dark one, now. We all do.” He hesitated, then produced a second, much smaller item from his pocket. It was a box of tea. A very expensive, artisanal blend with a simple, elegant label. “And this is from me. I know you think it’s just leaf-flavoured water, but… well, it’s not coffee. It’s what we do here. We have a cup of tea. It’s supposed to make things better.”

Publicover took the box. She looked at it, then at Finch’s tired, earnest face. She thought of the half-drunk cup of tea by Arthur Albright’s reading chair, the last normal thing in a normal life. She thought of the endless steaming mugs Finch had nursed, a talisman against the encroaching dread. It wasn’t just leaf-flavoured water. It was a ritual. It was a way of holding the world together. “Thank you, Alistair,” she said, and her voice was surprisingly soft. “I’ll… try it.”

Their handshake at the door was firm and brief. There was nothing more to say. They had stood together on the edge of the abyss, and they had not fallen in. That was a bond that needed no further words.

Hours later, Flight 227 banked sharply over the patchwork green of the English countryside. Publicover sat in a window seat, the small, leather-bound book resting in her lap. Below her, the ancient landscape, scarred with history and secrets, shrank away, soon to be obscured by a thick blanket of impenetrable white cloud. She was going home, back to a cold she understood, a cold that was honest in its severity. But she knew the chill of Upper Gristle would travel with her. It was a part of her now, a piece of grim knowledge filed away behind her eyes. It was the understanding that the most profound evil doesn’t always come with thunder and lightning. Sometimes it comes with a warm smile, a friendly word, and the comforting, familiar smell of a fresh-baked pie. And sometimes, she thought, as the plane climbed into the clean, sterile blue of the upper atmosphere, the only thing you can do is refuse to take a bite.**7.**

One year later, the cold was a different animal. This was the honest, brutal cold of a Maine February, a cold that scoured the landscape clean and left it a stark etching of black trees and white snow. It did not seep; it cracked. It was a cold you could fight with wool and fire, a known enemy with clear rules of engagement. Detective Evelyn Publicover preferred it. She stood on the porch of her small, isolated house, a mug of coffee warming her hands, and watched her breath plume in the sub-zero air. The woods that pressed in on her property were silent, locked in the deep freeze. It was a clean, uncomplicated silence. And yet, some mornings, when the air was still and the sky was a particular shade of bruised grey, she could almost feel it: a phantom dampness in her joints, the ghost of a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature. The ghost of Upper Gristle.

She had returned to her old life, or a reasonable facsimile of it. She worked cold cases for the state police now, wrestling with yellowed files and faded photographs, imposing order on the quiet chaos of the past. Her colleagues found her even more reserved than before, her focus so absolute it was almost unnerving. She did not speak of the Anglo-American Policing Exchange. The official report, heavily redacted, had been filed and buried. The lurid headlines had faded. The case was closed. But for Publicover, it remained an open wound, packed with the salt of memory. The sound of a bell, the smell of baking, the particular texture of an English drizzle—any of these could transport her back in an instant, back to the musty station house and the creeping, sweet-scented dread.

The post arrived late, the mailman’s truck crunching its way up her long, unpaved drive. Among the usual bills and junk mail was a flimsy blue rectangle of trans-Atlantic airmail, its edges softened by its long journey. The return address was simply ‘A. Finch, Upper Gristle, UK.’ His handwriting was as familiar as her own. She took it inside, setting it on the polished wood of her kitchen table. For a moment, she just looked at it, a portal to a world she had tried to lock away. She had exchanged a few brief, professional emails with Finch in the months after her return, but this was the first letter. With a deliberate, almost ritualistic slowness, she made herself a cup of tea, using the expensive blend he had given her. The aroma of bergamot and something faintly smoky filled the kitchen. She had come to appreciate it, not for the taste, but for the memory it contained: a small, defiant act of civility in the face of unimaginable darkness. Finally, she sat and slit open the envelope.

The letter began as she expected, with updates that felt both mundane and momentous. Eleanor Vance was recovering well in Cornwall, her letters now filled with descriptions of sea birds rather than whispers of angels. The library had a new, younger librarian who was digitizing the entire collection, a move that the town elders viewed with deep suspicion. The pie shop remained boarded up, a permanent scar on the face of the market square. A property developer from London had tried to buy it, but the moment the locals learned he planned to open a “gourmet pastry emporium,” a quiet, determined campaign of sabotage and bureaucratic obstruction had driven him away. Some places, Finch wrote, are too haunted to be anything else.

Then the tone of the letter shifted. He wrote about the trial. Ronda had remained silent throughout, a mountain of contemptuous stillness. She offered no defence, showed no remorse. She had been sentenced to a whole-life tariff and sent to a brutalist high-security facility where she would spend the rest of her days in a concrete box, a monster finally, properly caged. But it was during the pre-sentencing psychiatric evaluations that something new had emerged. In one session, buoyed by some private, narcissistic impulse, she had spoken of her legacy. She had corrected the psychiatrist who had referred to her crimes as unique. "Unique?" she had reportedly scoffed, her voice a melodic whisper. "My dear doctor, I am merely a practitioner of a very old family trade. My work is but a footnote compared to the masterpieces of my grandmother. They called her Mother Soule down in Lower Bleakley. She was the heart of her village."

Finch’s handwriting grew more cramped, more urgent, on the page. He had done some digging, off the books. Lower Bleakley was a tiny, forgotten hamlet in the deepest folds of Devon, a place where the fog never truly lifted from the river valley. The local archives were sparse, but he had found what he was looking for: a period of three years in the early 1950s where the village had suffered a string of inexplicable disappearances. A farmhand with no family. A travelling tinker. Two spinster sisters who lived in an isolated cottage. The cases had gone cold almost immediately, written off as people simply moving on in the post-war shuffle. And during that exact period, a woman of prodigious size had run the local soup kitchen, famed for a broth so rich and restorative it was said to cure all ills. The old records referred to her only as Mrs. Soule. When the disappearances had stopped, she, too, had vanished.

“The rot is in the bloodline, Eve,” Finch wrote, the words stark against the page. “I tried to raise it through official channels, but no one wants to listen. The case is closed. Ronda is behind bars. To them, digging up a fifty-year-old cold case in a different county based on the ramblings of a convicted psychopath is a fool’s errand. But we know it’s not rambling. She was boasting. It’s an inheritance of hunger, a tradition passed from mother to daughter. I look at the files from Lower Bleakley, and it’s like reading our own reports in a different font. It’s the same pattern, the same methodology, the same monstrous appetite hiding in plain sight. I have to know. I have to be sure it ended with Ronda. I need your help. I need the person who saw what I couldn't see.”

Publicover put the letter down, her hand trembling slightly. She looked out the window at the clean, white snow, a landscape of absolute clarity. But she wasn't seeing it. She was seeing a genealogical chart of evil, a family tree whose branches were laden with human bones. She had told Finch that a god without believers is just a story someone forgot to tell. But what if the story wasn't forgotten? What if it was just waiting, dormant, in the fog-bound valleys of England, ready for the next chapter to be written? The hunt was not over. It had only gone dormant. A cold deeper than the Maine winter seeped into her, a damp, familiar chill that promised mildew, and secrets, and a very old, very patient hunger.**8.**

For three days, the letter sat on Publicover’s kitchen table, an object of potent gravity in the clean, spartan space. It was a summons from a life she had surgically excised. She went through the motions of her own existence—reviewing the brittle files of long-dead victims, driving the snow-swept back roads of rural Maine, sitting in the profound silence of her isolated home—but her mind was elsewhere. It was 3,000 miles away, in a damp, forgotten corner of England, contemplating the chilling biology of inherited evil. The cold cases on her desk, once a noble puzzle, now seemed like trivial footnotes. They were about singular acts of desperation or rage, events with a beginning and an end. This was different. This was a lineage. A species. Ronda had not been an aberration; she had been a specimen.

On the fourth morning, she woke before dawn, the decision made not in a flash of insight but in a slow, cold crystallization of purpose. She drove to the state police barracks, the tires of her truck the only sound in the frozen world. She found her captain nursing a thermos of coffee in his office, a man who respected her formidable closure rate and was quietly unnerved by her complete lack of personal connection. She did not offer a convoluted excuse. She simply placed her badge and service weapon on his desk. "I'm resigning," she said, her voice devoid of emotion. "I have a personal matter to attend to. Overseas." The captain, a man used to the messy emotions of his subordinates, was taken aback by the sheer, cold finality of the act. He saw in her eyes the same unswerving focus she brought to her cases, but turned inward now, aimed at some unknown target beyond his jurisdiction. There was no arguing with it. He simply nodded, and just like that, her old life was over.

Her return to England was a reverse image of her first arrival. There was no official welcome, no sense of professional purpose. She flew into a regional airport in the Midlands to avoid the scrutiny of Heathrow, travelling on a tourist visa with a single, large duffel bag. The air that met her as she stepped from the terminal was soft, damp, and smelled of wet earth and exhaust fumes. It felt less like a homecoming and more like a willing return to a fever dream. Finch was waiting for her, standing by the rental car kiosk. The year had chiselled away at him. The comfortable, rumpled quality was gone completely, replaced by a lean, watchful intensity. He was thinner, his eyes were shadowed with a lack of sleep, and the tweed jacket he wore was that of a man who had forgotten how to be comfortable. He looked less like a country policeman and more like a grizzled spy coming in from the cold.

Their greeting was a simple, loaded nod. The time for pleasantries was long past. They drove in silence for the first hour, winding their way south through a landscape of bruised winter greens and brooding grey skies. "I took early retirement," Finch said eventually, his eyes fixed on the road. "Pension's enough to get by. Couldn't do it anymore. The job. Every missing person report that came across my desk, I saw her. Every village fête, I wondered what was in the food." He glanced at her, a flicker of the old, weary Finch returning. "You ruined me for police work, Eve." He said it without bitterness, as a simple statement of fact. "You taught me to look for the real monster, and now I can't see anything else."

He had not taken her to his home. Instead, they arrived at a small, anonymous industrial park on the outskirts of a dreary market town. He led her to a featureless, cinderblock garage unit, the kind used by plumbers or electricians to store supplies. He unlocked a heavy padlock and rolled up the metal door. The space inside was not filled with tools or vans, but had been converted into a private, obsessive incident room. Two large corkboards dominated one wall, covered in maps, documents, and photographs, all interconnected by a spider's web of coloured string. One board was a perfect, grim reconstruction of the Upper Gristle case. The other was new, sprawling, and far more chaotic. At its centre was a blown-up, grainy photograph of a stout, unsmiling woman in 1950s attire, standing in front of a dilapidated Nissen hut. Below it, a handwritten label read: ‘MOTHER SOULE.’

"Welcome to the rabbit hole," Finch said, his voice low. He gestured to the new board. "This is what I have. Not much. Lower Bleakley is barely a place anymore. The old industry died out, the young people left. It's just a handful of houses, a pub that opens three nights a week, and a church with a leaky roof. The records are a nightmare. Fires, floods, general neglect." He began to trace the lines of string with his finger, his movements honed by months of solitary study. He pointed to small, black-and-white photos of the missing. "John Pettle, a farmhand. Lived in a tied cottage, no known relatives. Vanished in the spring of '52. Found his cap in a field a week later, that was it. The Hatcher sisters, Rose and Iris. Spinsters. Lived up on the moor road. Their garden was famous. One day, they were just… gone. Neighbours assumed they'd finally moved to be with a cousin in Australia. No one ever checked."

Publicover moved closer, her eyes scanning the board, absorbing the fragments of lost lives. The pattern was undeniable, a ghostly echo of their own investigation. But this was colder, older, the evidence degraded by the simple, corrosive passage of time. "She had a family," Publicover stated, her focus narrowing on the central question. "Ronda said so. A grandmother, a mother. Did Mother Soule have other children?"

Finch shook his head, a gesture of deep frustration. "That's the brick wall. There's no birth certificate for a 'Ronda Soule'. No school records. No marriage license for Mrs. Soule. It's like she manifested from the fog, did her work, and dissolved back into it. But…" he trailed off, moving to a small, locked filing cabinet in the corner. He unlocked it and pulled out a single, acid-free archival box. "Ronda had a daughter."

The statement hit Publicover with the force of a physical shock. She stared at him, her mind scrambling to incorporate this new, terrifying piece of information. "What?"

Finch opened the box and carefully lifted out a single sheet of paper, a modern printout from a genealogy website. "Ronda wasn't her real name. It was a nickname, a persona. Her birth name was Gwyneth. Gwyneth Soule. And when she was sixteen, long before she became the baker of Upper Gristle, she gave birth to a daughter. The father isn't listed. The child was given up for adoption almost immediately. A closed adoption. All records sealed." He laid the paper on a small table. Publicover looked down at the name printed there, the name of the child who carried the bloodline, the potential heir to the family's monstrous tradition. Her name was Katherine. Katherine Holloway, adopted by a family in Bristol. She would be forty-three years old.

"Where is she now?" Publicover's voice was a whisper.

"I don't know," Finch admitted, and the failure was a physical weight on him. "I've hit the limits of what a retired policeman with a laptop can do. The adoption records are sealed tighter than a drum. Without official authority, which no one will grant me, I can't get any further. She could be anyone, anywhere. A doctor, a lawyer, a housewife in the suburbs. A perfectly normal woman who has no idea that the monster in her DNA is sleeping… or waiting." He looked from the printout of the adoption record to the grim board dedicated to Mother Soule. "We have to go to Lower Bleakley," he said, his voice filled with a new, desperate urgency. "We can't find the daughter by looking forward. We have to go back. We have to walk the ground, talk to the ghosts. Someone in that village must remember something. A name, a detail, a hint of where the Soule family came from. It's the only way to find the root. It's the only way to know if Katherine Holloway is a victim of her ancestry, or the next chapter in the story."Lower Bleakley did not so much appear on the map as it seeped from its edges, a place defined by what surrounded it. The roads that led to it grew progressively narrower and more derelict, the smooth tarmac of the A-roads giving way to patched-up country lanes, and finally to a single, rutted track choked by high hedgerows. The sky, a uniform and oppressive grey, seemed to press down on the roof of their small rental car, the landscape growing more ancient and inhospitable with every mile. The lush, rolling hills of the Midlands flattened into a brooding, waterlogged plateau, a place where skeletal trees clawed at the fog and the air grew thick with the smell of river mud and decay. This was not a journey to a town; it was a descent into a memory.

The village, when they finally found it, was a scattering of stone cottages huddled together as if for warmth against a permanent chill. Many had the blank, cataract-stare of boarded-up windows. A squat, Norman church, its stone dark with centuries of damp, stood sentinel over a graveyard of listing, moss-eaten headstones. A sluggish, brown river coiled around the edge of the settlement, its banks a morass of reeds and sucking mud. The silence was absolute, broken only by the cawing of a lone raven perched on the lychgate and the steady, weeping drip of water from sagging eaves. It was a place that felt not merely quiet, but silenced.

They parked near the river, by a pub whose sign was so faded by weather as to be illegible. It was called The Drowning Man. Finch looked at it, then at the spectral cottages. "Charming," he muttered, the word a piece of black, exhausted humour. "You can feel it, can't you? The weight of it." Publicover felt it. It was a pressure in the air, a cloying stillness that reminded her of a sealed tomb. This was a place where secrets had been buried so deep they had become part of the geology.

Inside, the pub was a cave of shadows, smelling of damp wool, woodsmoke, and the ghosts of beers spilled long ago. A handful of old men, faces as weathered and grooved as bog oak, were scattered at separate tables, nursing their pints in a communal, wordless gloom. The publican, a heavy-set man with a face like a slab of raw meat, wiped the bar with a rag that had seen better decades. He watched them approach, his eyes small and suspicious. Finch, falling back into the familiar role of the friendly local bobby, ordered two pints of whatever was on tap, his voice a little too loud in the oppressive quiet. Publicover stood slightly behind him, an alien presence in her dark, practical American clothes, her gaze sweeping the room, logging the hostile curiosity in the eyes that flickered towards her and then quickly away.

They took a table in the corner, the beer tasting of metal and river water. The old men pointedly ignored them, their silence a wall as solid as stone. After a few minutes of feigned casualness, Finch stood and walked to the bar, ostensibly to admire a fly-blown taxidermy pike in a glass case. "Slow afternoon," he remarked to the publican. The man just grunted. "My friend and I," Finch continued, his tone conversational, "we're amateur historians. Interested in the post-war period in these parts. The fifties. We heard there used to be a soup kitchen hereabouts, during the rationing. Run by a woman… a Mrs. Soule, I believe?"

The effect was instantaneous and profound. It was not a sound, but the absence of it. The low murmur of conversation that had existed, almost subliminally, ceased entirely. One of the old men, who had been about to raise his glass to his lips, set it down with a soft, deliberate click. The publican stopped wiping the bar, his hand frozen in mid-air. No one looked at Finch. They all looked at the floor, or their hands, or the dark, swirling contents of their glasses. A palpable dread, cold and ancient, filled the room.

"We don't talk about that," the publican said finally, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. He picked up his rag and began wiping the bar again, his movements slow and final. It was not a suggestion. It was an order.

"I understand it was a long time ago," Finch pressed gently, his nerves tightening. "We just want to understand the history of the place."

"Some history's best left buried," one of the old men rasped from his corner, his face a web of wrinkles. He didn't look up. "You go digging around here, you'll find nothing but bad roots and bitter soil."

Finch returned to the table, his face pale. "They know," he whispered to Publicover. "They don't know *what* they know, but they know it's something to be feared. The name is a curse." Publicover nodded, her eyes still on the old men, who had retreated even further into their private worlds of silence. This wasn't just a town with a dark past; it was a town held hostage by it, a collective of prisoners who had long ago agreed not to talk about the bars on their windows. They finished their pints in silence, the taste of rust more pronounced than ever, and left the pub, the weight of a dozen hostile glares following them out into the damp, grey air.

As they stood by their car, the fog beginning to roll in from the river, thickening the air and blurring the edges of the world, one of the pub’s side doors creaked open. The old man who had spoken, the one with the raspy voice, emerged, hunched in a threadbare coat. He scurried over to them, his eyes darting around nervously as if afraid of being seen. "You're asking the wrong questions in the wrong place," he hissed, his breath a foul cloud of tobacco and decay. "You want to know about the old times? You want to know about her?" He spat on the ground, a gesture of profound disgust. "There's only one person left who'd talk about it. Agnes Thorne. Lives in the last cottage on the moor road. Mad as a March hare, been that way for sixty years." He took a step back, melting into the fog. "Tell her you're asking about the Hatcher sisters," he whispered, his voice a spectral echo. "Then lock your doors."**9.**

The moor road was less a road and more a scar on the landscape, a faint, winding track that climbed out of the suffocating valley and into the open emptiness of the plateau. The fog followed them, clinging to the chassis of the car, its tendrils creeping across the windscreen like ghostly fingers. The world dissolved into a fifty-foot circle of visibility, a moving bubble of bleak reality in an ocean of grey nothingness. The silence here was different from the village. It was not the heavy, sullen silence of secrets, but the vast, elemental silence of a place that had never learned to speak, a silence that predated man and would endure long after he was gone. Skeletal, wind-blasted hawthorn trees loomed out of the mist and then vanished, their thorny branches like pleading hands.

“Last cottage on the moor road,” Finch murmured, his voice sounding small and thin against the immense quiet. He gripped the steering wheel, peering into the swirling grey, his face a mask of concentration. “God knows how anyone lives out here. You wouldn’t just go mad, you’d forget you ever existed.” Publicover didn’t reply. She was scanning the featureless landscape, her mind coolly assessing the tactical implications of the terrain. The isolation was absolute. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. It was a perfect hunting ground. The thought settled in her mind not with a sense of fear, but with a cold, professional respect for the predator who had chosen it.

They found it almost by accident. A crooked stone chimney, breathing a thin plume of pale grey smoke into the pale grey air, materialized from the fog. The cottage was hunkered low against the earth, its slate roof sagging and furred with a luminous green moss, its stone walls stained black with damp. A low, crumbling wall enclosed a patch of ground that might once have been a garden, but was now a riot of dead bracken and skeletal, thorny weeds. It looked less like a home and more like a fossil, a last remnant of life clinging to a dying world. This was the home of Agnes Thorne.

As they got out of the car, the silence pressed in, amplifying the sound of their own heartbeats. The air was raw, cold, and smelled of wet peat and something else, something faintly acrid, like old bonfires. Publicover’s gaze was drawn to the front door. It was painted a startling, peeling turquoise, but it was what was nailed to it that held her attention: a collection of rust-pocked iron objects. A horseshoe, several bent and twisted nails, a broken sickle blade. They were arranged in a pattern that was not quite random, a piece of desperate, forgotten folk magic meant to ward off evil.

Finch knocked, the sound absurdly loud. For a long moment, there was no response. Then, they heard a scuttling sound from within, the drawing of a bolt, and the door creaked open a few inches. A single, bright, suspicious eye peered out at them from the darkness. “We’re closed,” a voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement announced. “Whatever you’re selling, we don’t want it.”

“Mrs. Thorne? Agnes Thorne?” Finch began, his voice gentle. “My name is Alistair Finch. We’re not selling anything. We were told you might be able to help us. We’re… we’re asking about the Hatcher sisters.” He delivered the line as instructed, a key turning in an ancient, rusted lock.

The eye widened. The door opened another few inches. The woman who stood there was as ancient and weathered as the landscape itself. She was tiny, a bird-boned creature wrapped in a multitude of mismatched woollen shawls, her face a collapsed map of wrinkles from which her eyes shone with a feverish, intelligent light. This was not the vacant stare of madness, but the hyper-vigilance of the perpetually terrified. “Rose and Iris?” she whispered, the names like a prayer. “No one’s said their names out loud in sixty years.” She looked from Finch’s weary, kind face to Publicover’s sharp, unreadable one. “You’re not from around here,” she said to Publicover. It was not a question. “You have a cold look about you. A killer’s look.” She seemed not frightened by this, but reassured. She opened the door wider. “Come in. Before it sees you.”

The cottage’s interior was a single, cluttered room, a cave filled with the detritus of a lifetime of fear. Jars of dried herbs and fungi lined every shelf. Strings of bird skulls and bottle caps hung from the low-beamed ceiling. The air was thick with the smell of woodsmoke, chamomile, and the sharp tang of mothballs. It was a fortress built of superstition. Agnes scuttled over to a small hearth where a peat fire glowed sullenly and began to make tea in a blackened kettle, her movements quick and furtive.

“Their garden was a wonder,” she said suddenly, her back to them. “They could make things grow on this sour land that God himself couldn’t. Sweet peas like stained glass. Roses the colour of blood. They were good women. Kind women.” She turned, handing them chipped mugs of a pale, fragrant tea. Her hands trembled. “Then the Fat Woman came.” It was the name a child would give, and it had stuck for six decades. “She’d walk up from the village, with her big wicker basket. Said she was collecting herbs for her soups. Said she admired their garden. She’d smile, but her eyes were like a pig’s eyes. Small and hungry. She’d ask for cuttings, and Rose, being so kind, would always give her some. Iris didn’t like it. ‘That woman’s touch curdles the soil,’ she’d say.”

Agnes sat opposite them, clutching her mug, her gaze fixed on a point in the middle distance, sixty years away. “I was a girl then. We played on the moor. Hide-and-seek was our favourite. One evening, I was hiding in the bracken behind the Hatcher’s cottage. It was getting dark. The fog was rolling in, just like tonight. And I saw her. The Fat Woman. Leaving through their back gate. She was carrying something. Not her basket. A long, heavy hessian sack. It was dripping.” She shuddered, a violent, full-body tremor. “It dripped dark on the white stones of the path. She didn’t see me. She just walked off into the fog, humming. A soft, happy little tune.”

Publicover and Finch exchanged a look. It was a perfect, chilling echo. The humming. The good cheer of the predator. “Was she alone?” Publicover asked, her voice low and even, careful not to break the spell of the memory.

Agnes’s bright eyes snapped to her. “No,” she whispered, leaning forward. “That was the worst part. She wasn’t alone. Her girl was with her. Gwyneth. A sullen, pale lump of a teenager who looked at everything with dead eyes. And Gwyneth was holding the hand of another one. A little one. Smaller. Maybe five or six years old. She was like a shadow. She never spoke, never smiled. I saw them only that once, the three of them together. The Fat Woman, the Sullen Girl, and the Shadow Child.” Her voice dropped even lower. “They weren’t a family. They were a pack.”

A third child. The information hit Finch like a physical blow. A sister to Ronda, another raised in that house of horrors. Publicover’s face remained a mask, but her mind was racing, reconfiguring the entire bloodline. It wasn’t a simple line of succession. It was a brood.

“The next day,” Agnes continued, her voice trembling, “the Hatchers were gone. The door was open. The cottage was cold. Their prize-winning roses had been cut, all of them, right down to the root. Dug up. Nothing left but churned, black soil.” She stared into her mug. “The police came. Said they’d gone to Australia. But I knew. I knew she’d put them in her sack. I knew she’d put them in her soup.” She looked up, and for the first time, tears welled in her bright, mad eyes. “I never told anyone. I was a child. Who would have believed me? I’ve spent my whole life since then with the doors locked, listening for humming in the fog.”

“Agnes,” Finch said, his voice thick with compassion. “Did you ever hear her say where she came from? The Fat Woman? Another town, a name?”

Agnes shook her head, a gesture of deep, weary sorrow. “No. She was just… here. But I heard her once, shouting at the girl, at Gwyneth. She was angry. Gwyneth had dropped a basket, spilled something. The Fat Woman grabbed her arm, her voice was like a snake hissing. I only heard a few words. She said… she said she’d send her back. Back to the rookery. Back to *Corvus End*.” The name came out of her mouth like a shard of black glass, a name she had held on her tongue for sixty years, a piece of poison she had never dared to spit out until now.The name hung in the tiny, smoke-filled room like a black feather, a piece of a forgotten language that suddenly held a terrible meaning. *Corvus End*. Publicover and Finch left Agnes Thorne’s cottage in a state of shared, silent shock, the old woman bolting the door behind them with a finality that felt like the closing of a crypt. They walked back to the car through a fog that was no longer just weather but a living entity, a shroud that had kept this secret safe for sixty years. The rust-pocked charms on Agnes’s door seemed pitifully inadequate against the darkness she had just named. They were not just hunting the legacy of a single killer or her monstrous grandmother; they were hunting the legacy of a place, a nursery of evil that had spawned them all.

The drive back from the moor was a slow ascent from the depths of a bad dream. The oppressive silence was finally broken by Publicover, her voice flat and analytical, a shield against the creeping dread. “Corvus is the Latin genus for crows, ravens, rooks. A rookery is a colony. But it’s also old slang for a slum, a place of thieves and squalor. Corvus End. It’s not a metaphor. It’s a place name.” Her mind was stripping the name down to its components, treating it not as a piece of folklore but as a data point, a pin to be placed on a map. Finch gripped the wheel, his face pale in the dashboard's glow. "A pack," he said, his voice a strained whisper. "She said they were a pack. Gwyneth, Ronda, wasn't an only child. There was another one. The Shadow Child. Good God, Eve, Katherine Holloway might not be the only one out there. We could be looking for a whole family." The implication was staggering. They had been hunting a single predator, only to discover she might be part of a scattered, hidden litter.

Back in the cold, sterile sanctuary of their garage, the ritual began anew. Publicover took a fresh index card and wrote ‘CORVUS END’ in stark, black letters, pinning it to the very top of the new board, above the grainy photo of Mother Soule. It was the headwaters of their river of blood. Beside Gwyneth/Ronda’s name, Finch added another card with a single, chilling question mark and the words ‘The Shadow Child’. The web of string and paper was growing, transforming from a simple lineage into a monstrous, sprawling family tree, its roots twisting deep into a past they could barely comprehend and its branches reaching into a present that was terrifyingly unknown. The question of Katherine Holloway’s fate was now complicated by the existence of a sibling, another variable in their horrifying equation.

For two days, they barely slept, fueled by black coffee and a cold, obsessive fury. The garage became a digital excavation site. Finch, with a grim determination, delved into online archives of ordnance survey maps, tithe records, and county archives, his search terms growing more and more obscure. Publicover, meanwhile, applied her formidable analytical skills to a different kind of terrain, scouring digitized newspaper archives, academic papers on Victorian social institutions, and forums for local historians. They were looking for a ghost, a name that had been spoken in anger sixty years ago and had likely vanished from all official records. They found dozens of dead ends: Corvus Lane in Norwich, a Corvus Cottage in Northumberland. Nothing fit. Nothing resonated with the grim history they were uncovering. The name remained stubbornly locked in Agnes Thorne’s memory, a place with no modern coordinates.

The breakthrough came from Finch, late on the second night. His eyes were red-rimmed from staring at the screen, but he let out a sharp, triumphant hiss. “I’ve got it.” He had abandoned modern searches and was manually scrolling through a high-resolution scan of a pre-war Bartholomew’s cycling map of the West Country coast, a document concerned with contours and gradients, not official place names. There, on a desolate, marshy peninsula known for shipwrecks and smugglers, was a tiny, almost illegible annotation next to a small cluster of buildings. It wasn't an official name, but a local one, a landmark for travellers. It read: *The Crow’s End Folly*. Publicover was instantly at his side. She took the name and plunged it back into her own search, this time targeting architectural records. Within minutes, she had it. The ‘folly’ was no folly. It was a former Victorian workhouse, built in the 1870s by a wealthy industrialist with a grim religious fervor. Its official name was the St. Jude’s Home for Foundlings and Unfortunates, but its brutal reputation had earned it the local moniker of ‘The Rookery’ and, due to its bleak location, ‘Crow’s End’.

A shiver of ice traced its way down Publicover’s spine as the history unfurled on her laptop screen. Corvus End had been a place of institutionalized cruelty, a human dumping ground where inconvenient children were sent to be forgotten. It had a horrifying mortality rate, attributed to malnutrition and disease. After a series of scandals, it was nominally shut down, but the building was privately sold and reopened as an unregulated children’s home in the 1930s, a place that operated completely off the books. It was a black hole in the system, a place where a child could vanish without a single piece of paper to mark their existence. The home was finally abandoned for good after a mysterious fire in 1948, just a few years before Mother Soule appeared in Lower Bleakley. The circle was complete. The origin story was written in a history of neglect, starvation, and survival of the fittest. Mother Soule had not just appeared from the fog; she had been forged in the crucible of Corvus End, a place where the lines between caregiver and predator, and between human and ingredient, had been erased long ago.

Publicover pushed back from the table, the enormity of the discovery settling upon her. This was the source. This was the nest. It was the place where Mother Soule had learned her trade, where she had sourced her own 'children', Gwyneth and the Shadow Child, and where she had learned that a human life had no value beyond its utility. It explained their rootlessness, their lack of official records, their feral cunning. They were not a family in any recognizable sense; they were the graduates of an institution of horror, passing down its lessons through blood and bone. Finch looked up from his maps, his face pale but his eyes burning with a terrible certainty. They both knew what came next. The research was done. The time for digging through archives was over.

Finch rose and walked to a steel locker in the corner of the garage. He opened it, revealing two sets of dark, all-weather tactical gear, packs, and climbing ropes. He had been preparing for this. He had known their search would not end in a library. "It’s a three-hour drive to the coast," he said, his voice steady. He pulled out a waterproof holdall and began to pack it with flashlights, first aid supplies, and heavy-duty bolt cutters. "The place has been derelict for over seventy years. It will be dangerous." Publicover looked at the grim tableau on the corkboard—the faces of the dead, the question marks for the living, and at the very top, the name of the place where it had all begun. She nodded, her own mind already shifting from historical analysis to tactical planning. Their hunt for Katherine Holloway, for the Shadow Child, for the end of the bloodline, was not going to be found in any official record. The answers, if they existed at all, were waiting for them in the ruins of Corvus End.**10.**

The journey to the coast was a process of peeling away the layers of the modern world. The motorways gave way to A-roads, then to the winding, claustrophobic B-roads that hugged the contours of the land with an ancient intimacy. Finally, even these petered out, depositing them onto a single-track causeway that ran across a vast, desolate salt marsh. The air changed, growing heavy and thick with the brine-scent of the sea and the low-tide smell of decay. Grey, silty water flanked them on both sides, the marsh grass hissing in a wind that had an edge like a blade. In the distance, framed by a sky the colour of a dead fish, a dark finger of land clawed its way out into the turbulent channel: the peninsula. It felt like they were driving off the edge of the map and into the bleak illustrations of a forgotten storybook.

When they finally saw it, it was not so much a building as a geological feature, a man-made intrusion that the landscape was slowly, inexorably digesting. Perched on the highest point of the headland, silhouetted against the churning grey sea, stood the ruins of Corvus End. It was a gaunt, skeletal structure of dark stone, its Victorian Gothic architecture a monument to misplaced piety and institutional cruelty. Jagged, empty window sockets stared out at the sea like the eyes of a skull. A significant portion of the roof had collapsed inward, and one entire wing was a blackened, soot-stained ruin, a permanent scar left by the fire that had supposedly closed its doors forever. It was not a place where people had lived; it was a place where hope had died, and its corpse had been left to rot in the wind.

They left the car where the track dissolved into mud and bracken and approached on foot, the wind tearing at their jackets, carrying the mournful cries of gulls and the percussive crash of waves against the cliffs below. The scale of the ruin was immense, far larger than they had anticipated, a sprawling complex of wings and courtyards designed to contain and process human misery on an industrial scale. They began a slow, deliberate circuit of the perimeter, Publicover moving with a tactical awareness that felt both necessary and absurd in this desolate place. The walls were slick with green slime and dark with damp, and the air of dereliction was so profound it felt like a physical presence. A flock of rooks, disturbed by their approach, rose from a skeletal tree in the central courtyard, their harsh, guttural calls echoing off the stone walls like a chorus of damned souls.

"There," Publicover said, pointing not to a door, but to a place where the ground had subsided near the foundation of the ruined wing. A set of heavy, iron-ringed cellar doors, the kind used for delivering coal or provisions, had been twisted and half-buried by the collapse. One of the stone slabs that framed them had cracked, leaving a dark, jagged opening just wide enough for a person to squeeze through. It was a wound in the building’s side, an uninviting invitation into its dark heart. Finch produced a heavy-duty flashlight and a length of rope from his pack, his movements economical and grimly determined. There was no hesitation. This was the place. The answers were inside. Publicover took one last look at the desolate, windswept landscape, then nodded. She went first, lowering herself through the jagged opening into the absolute darkness below.

The air that met them was a foul, multi-layered assault on the senses: the cold, mineral smell of damp stone, the cloying sweetness of rot, the bitter tang of ancient soot, and something else, something metallic and acrid that clung to the back of the throat. Their flashlight beams cut through the Stygian gloom, revealing a vast, vaulted cellar. It was not merely a storage space. The walls were lined with small, bricked-off cells, each with a heavy iron door and a small barred slit at eye level. These were punishment cells, oubliettes for troublesome children. Finch ran his light over one of the doors, the beam catching on a series of scratches gouged into the thick wood. Publicover moved closer, her own light joining his. They were marks. Tally marks, counting the days. And below them, scratched with what must have been a fingernail, was a single, crudely drawn stick figure of a child, its mouth a perfect, silent ‘O’ of a scream.

They moved deeper into the labyrinthine cellars, the silence broken only by the drip of water and the scuttling of unseen things. In the furthest, dampest corner, they found what they had been looking for, a clue left by the long-dead. One of the punishment cells was different. The door had been ripped from its hinges, the iron twisted as if by inhuman force. Inside, the small space was bare, save for the graffiti that covered one wall. It was a child’s frantic, obsessive scrawling. Dozens of names were scratched into the stone: ‘MARY’, ‘JOHN’, ‘THOMAS’. But it was the drawings that held them transfixed. There was a crude but unmistakable depiction of a large, fat woman ladling something from a huge pot. And beside it, a drawing of two small girls, one taller than the other, holding hands. The smaller girl had no mouth. Below this horrifying cartoon, a single word was repeated over and over, gouged deep into the stone as if by a mind fixated on a single, primal truth: ‘HUNGRY. HUNGRY. HUNGRY.’

Shaken, they ascended a crumbling stone staircase, emerging from the cellar into the main body of the workhouse. They found themselves in the ruins of the refectory, the great hall where the inmates had taken their meagre meals. The fire had done its worst here. The roof was gone, open to the weeping sky. Charred beams lay across the floor like the ribs of a leviathan. Long rows of rotted tables and benches, miraculously spared the worst of the flames, still stood in silent, orderly ranks, a ghostly congregation waiting for a meal that would never come. The sheer, oppressive weight of sadness in the room was suffocating, a psychic stain left by a thousand hungry children.

They bypassed the ravaged dormitories and the chapel with its fire-blackened altar and made their way towards the administrative wing, which seemed more structurally sound. They found the Matron’s office, a small, severe room with a commanding view of the central courtyard. A heavy iron safe, a relic of Victorian security, stood in one corner, its door blackened and warped, but not broken. The fire had seized its mechanism. “Stand back,” Finch said, hefting the heavy-duty bolt cutters. It took ten minutes of grunting, sweating work, the screech of metal on metal echoing through the silent building, before the thick locking bolt finally sheared through with a loud crack. The heavy door swung open with a groan. Inside, a stack of ledgers sat on a metal shelf. The top few were charred to ash, but the one at the very bottom, protected by the others, was merely smoke-blackened and water-damaged.

With a reverence usually reserved for sacred texts, Finch carefully lifted the fragile book out and placed it on the Matron’s desk, its pages swollen and brittle. The ink had bled, creating soft, grey ghosts of words, but many of the entries, written in a spidery, unforgiving copperplate, were still legible. It was an admissions ledger, dating from the early 1930s, the period when Corvus End had slipped into its unregulated, off-the-books existence. Publicover’s light followed Finch’s trembling finger as he scanned the names. And then he stopped. “Gwyneth,” he breathed. The entry was stark: *‘Gwyneth. Approx. age 7. Found wandering, South Marshes. No surname given. Healthy specimen, good teeth.’* It was the clinical, appraising language of a livestock auction. Publicover felt a cold knot tighten in her stomach. Then, just below it, a second entry, dated the same day. Her heart hammered against her ribs. This was it. The Shadow Child. The entry was even more brutal in its brevity. *‘Elspeth. Approx. age 5. Found with Gwyneth. Mute. Unresponsive. Designated for kitchen duties.’* They had a name. Elspeth. And a horrifying designation that confirmed their worst fears about the "family trade." The tradition had not begun with Mother Soule; she had merely perfected it, bringing the monstrous economy of Corvus End out into the wider world.The words seemed to burn on the page, illuminated by the twin beams of their flashlights. *Designated for kitchen duties*. It was not a job description; it was a death sentence, or worse, a damnation. This was the source code. This was the academy where the monstrous philosophy of the Soule family had been codified. They did not invent their horror; they had inherited it, learned it by rote in the starving, brutal classrooms of Corvus End. Finch let out a low, ragged breath, a sound of utter spiritual exhaustion. All this time, they had been chasing the branches, but here, in this mouldering book, they had found the poisoned root. Publicover felt no such release. She felt a cold, terrible clarity settle over her, the grim satisfaction of a theorist whose most monstrous hypothesis has just been proven undeniably true. The cycle of consumption hadn't started with a choice; it had started as a necessity, a system of survival in a place where children were less than human, mere entries in a ledger of disposable assets.

With the care of a bomb disposal expert, Finch continued to turn the fragile pages, his search now invested with a new and terrible purpose. They had found Gwyneth and Elspeth’s point of entry. Now they needed to find their exit. The pages were a litany of forgotten tragedies. *‘Samuel. Age 9. Weak chest. Expired.’* *‘Eliza. Age 6. Incorrigible. Sent to the isolation cells.’* *‘Infant, unnamed. Found on the parish steps. Failed to thrive.’* The dispassionate, looping script recorded the processing of human lives with the same clerical indifference as an inventory of flour sacks. They were approaching the late 1940s, the pages growing more brittle, the damage from the fire more pronounced. The entries became sparser, the handwriting more frantic. They were nearing the end of the institution's life, the final days before the fire that had wiped it from the map.

Finch turned another page, a cluster of them stuck together by damp, and as he gently prized them apart, a small, stiff rectangle of card slipped from between the leaves and fluttered to the dusty surface of the desk. It landed face up. It was a photograph, small and square with the deckle-edge popular in the mid-century, its black-and-white tones faded to shades of grey and sepia. An object of personal memory hidden within a ledger of institutional forgetting. It was so jarringly out of place that for a moment, both of them just stared at it, a fossil from a lost world. Finch reached for it, then stopped, letting Publicover, with her gloved hands, pick it up.

The photograph showed three figures standing against a plain brick wall, squinting in what looked like a rare moment of sunshine. On the left stood a woman who could only have been a younger version of Mother Soule, no longer an inmate but a figure of authority. She was not smiling. Her face was a mask of grim competence, a monolith of flesh and bone clad in a severe, dark dress. Beside her stood a sullen, powerfully built teenager with a familiar, resentful glare: Gwyneth, the girl who would become Ronda, her future monstrosity already visible in the set of her jaw. And half-hidden behind her, clutching the hem of her sister’s dress, was the third figure. Elspeth. She was a pale, fragile-looking girl of about ten or eleven, her hair lank, her expression unreadable. She was clutching a filthy, one-eyed rag doll to her chest with a fierce, protective grip. It was the only childish thing in the entire, grim portrait.

Publicover’s eyes did not linger on the faces. Her training took over, her gaze sweeping the background, hunting for context, for any detail that would anchor the image in time and space. The brickwork was clean, uniform, utterly different from the crumbling, slime-slicked stone of Corvus End. This was not here. This was somewhere else. And then she saw it. In the top right corner of the photograph, partially obscured by a shadow, was the edge of a hanging sign. It was an old-fashioned enamel sign, and the angle of the shot meant only a fragment of the lettering was visible. But it was enough. The letters were ornate, painted in a flowing script. Publicover leaned closer, her flashlight beam a surgical instrument. *‘…ell & Sons,’* she read aloud, her voice a low, tense whisper. And below it, a single, clear word: *‘BAKERS.’*

Finch stared at the photograph, then at the word Publicover had just spoken, and a look of dawning horror and understanding passed across his face. A bakery. The irony was so thick and grotesque it was almost suffocating. The craft, the persona, the public face of Ronda’s evil—it had a precedent. Before the pies, before the soups, there was this. A legitimate bakery. This photograph was the missing link, the bridge between the horrors of Corvus End and Mother Soule’s murderous debut in Lower Bleakley. It was proof that for some period of time, they had existed in the normal world, hiding their nature behind the wholesome, comforting facade of a baker’s shop.

“She learned it somewhere,” Publicover said, her voice barely audible over the sighing of the wind through the ruin’s empty windows. “The pastry. The craft. Ronda said it was her innovation.” She tapped the photograph with a gloved finger. “She lied. She apprenticed.” The implications were immense. They were not just the feral graduates of a brutal workhouse; they had, at some point, integrated, learned a trade, and perverted it to their own monstrous ends. This photograph was not just a memento; it was a clue to a place, a business, a potential new hunting ground of records and memories that existed outside the cursed peninsula of Corvus End.

With painstaking care, Finch placed the photograph and the precious ledger into a waterproof evidence bag he had brought from the car. The search of the ruins was over. They had descended into the tomb and emerged with its darkest secrets. They had the names, they had the origin, and now, they had a new, fragile thread to follow. They made their way back through the skeletal remains of the great hall, the silence of the thousand dead children seeming to press in on them, and emerged from the jagged opening in the cellar wall into the grey, weeping twilight. The sea crashed against the cliffs below, a rhythm of endless, indifferent power. They did not look back at the ruin. It was a place of endings. Their faces were turned towards the road, towards the hunt for a bakery that had once employed a family of monsters, and towards the terrifying, unanswered question of where, and who, Elspeth and Katherine were now.
