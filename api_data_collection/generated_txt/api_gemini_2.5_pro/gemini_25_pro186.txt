The first mistake, Professor Alistair Finch would later reflect, was the silence. Not the comfortable, book-lined silence of his study, where the only sound was the rustle of turning parchment or the gentle hum of the dehumidifier guarding his medieval manuscripts from Toowoomba’s insidious damp. This was a different kind of silence. It was the vast, yawning quiet of a Saturday afternoon in the Garden City, a quiet so profound it seemed to have weight, pressing down on the manicured lawns and the relentlessly cheerful flowerbeds of his neighbourhood. It was a silence that demanded to be filled, and Alistair, a man whose entire life was a monument to the quiet accumulation of knowledge, had chosen to fill it with the discordant clang of steel.

He stood in the centre of his perfectly circular patch of Sir Walter buffalo grass, a space he usually reserved for frowning at the encroaching clover. He was fifty-three years old. His hair, once a respectable academic brown, was now a sort of distinguished silver-grey chaos, as if a flock of confused sparrows had tried to build a nest in it. He wore not armour, but a pair of ill-fitting tracksuit pants and a faded university polo shirt bearing the crest of his faculty—a stylised open book and a quill, which felt, at that moment, like a particularly cruel joke. In his hands, he held the source of the recent, offensive noise: a five-foot length of German longsword, a blunt-edged training feder that had arrived three days earlier in a package so long and suggestive it had made the postman snort with laughter.

The sword was heavier than he’d imagined. The treatises, the vellum manuscripts he’d spent a decade translating, had spoken of the blade as an extension of the arm, a limb of shining steel. Fiore dei Liberi, the 14th-century master, wrote of the *gioco stretto*, the close play, with the intimacy of a lover. But Alistair’s new limb felt less like an extension and more like a hostile parasite. His arms ached. A line of sweat, cold and shameful, trickled from his temple down his jaw. He tried to raise the blade into one of the fundamental guards, the *posta di donna*, the woman’s guard. According to the diagrams, the sword should be held back over the shoulder, poised and ready. Alistair’s attempt looked less like a noble warrior and more like a man trying to scratch a particularly difficult itch between his shoulder blades with a length of scaffolding. The pommel knocked against his ear with a dull thud.

“For God’s sake, Alistair. What in the world are you doing?”

The voice, sharp and edged with the precise sort of marital exasperation that could curdle milk at twenty paces, belonged to his wife, Meredith. She stood on the back patio, arms crossed, a trowel dangling from one hand like a rejected sceptre. Her gardening gloves, usually caked in soil, were pristine. She had been about to wage war on the aphids colonising her prize-winning ‘Peace’ roses, but her husband’s bizarre display had clearly presented a more immediate and pressing pest problem.

“I’m… practicing,” Alistair said, lowering the sword. It felt ten times heavier now. He rested the tip on the grass, leaning on it like a weary pilgrim.

“Practicing for what? Has the Department of Philology finally resorted to trial by combat for tenure disputes? Are you challenging Professor Blevins for his parking space?”

“It’s a historical martial art, Mez. A reconstruction. I’m simply trying to better understand the texts.” It was his standard defence, the academic shield he used to justify all manner of esoteric and expensive hobbies, from his collection of rare Saxon coinage to the unfortunate month he’d spent trying to brew mead in the laundry.

Meredith took a step onto the lawn. Her gaze wasn’t angry, not yet. It was something far worse: a deep, archaeological pity, the kind one might reserve for a newly unearthed fossil of some spectacularly unsuccessful species. “Alistair, you’re a linguist. You analyse texts. You don’t… swashbuckle. You’ll pull a muscle. Or, God forbid, you’ll trip and impale yourself on the birdbath. The Henderson’s are having a barbecue next door. They can see you.”

The Hendersons. The thought sent a fresh wave of humiliation through him. Barry Henderson, a man whose neck was wider than Alistair’s thigh, who communicated in a series of affirming grunts and spent his weekends building terrifyingly robust pergolas. The idea of Barry’s bemused, condescending face peering over the fence was suddenly unbearable. Alistair felt his grip tighten on the leather-wrapped handle of the feder. It had all started with a jar of olives. A stubborn, tightly sealed jar of Kalamata olives three weeks ago. Meredith had been busy, and he had wanted to add them to a salad. He’d twisted until his knuckles were white, run it under hot water, tapped the lid with a knife. Nothing. Finally, with a sigh of theatrical weariness, Meredith had taken it from him and popped the seal with a flick of her wrist, her gardener’s grip making a mockery of his scholarly impotence. In that moment, surrounded by the scent of brine and his own inadequacy, he had felt a chasm open between the man he was and the men he studied. The knights, the warriors, the *armigeri* who strode through the pages of his life’s work, they would have opened the jar. They would have torn the lid from its threads. They would not have been defeated by preserved fruit.

The thought had festered. He was a man of words, of symbols, of dead languages and forgotten syntax. His body was just a soft, inconvenient vehicle for his brain. He looked at his hands, the fingers stained with ink and softened by a lifetime of turning pages. They felt alien, useless for anything beyond annotation. The sword was a rebellion. A clumsy, ridiculous, middle-aged rebellion against the tyranny of the intellect.

“I’m being careful,” he mumbled, not looking at her. He looked past her, at the dividing fence. It was a standard six-foot timber fence, weathered to a silver-grey that matched his hair. And over the top of it, he saw a flicker of movement. Not the Hendersons. The other side. The small rental property, currently occupied by a young woman he barely knew. He’d seen her coming and going, a student by the look of her, always with a stack of heavy textbooks that seemed to bow her narrow shoulders. Chloe, he thought her name was. He’d seen her name on a piece of misdelivered mail once. She was watching him. There was no judgment in her gaze, not like the pity in Meredith’s or the imagined scorn of Barry Henderson. It was just… observation. A quiet, steady assessment. Then, as quickly as she appeared, she was gone, a curtain falling back into place.

“Alistair, listen to me.” Meredith’s voice softened, but the pity remained. “This is a phase. Like the bonsai trees. Or the sourdough starter that tried to colonise the pantry. It will pass. Just… please, can you do it inside? Before you become the suburb’s leading eccentric?”

He nodded, defeated. The energy, the brief flicker of defiant purpose, had drained out of him, leaving only the familiar ache in his shoulders and the clammy dampness of his shirt. He dragged the sword back towards the house, its blunt tip carving a thin, pathetic line through the pristine lawn. It looked like a scar. Inside, he leaned the feder against a towering bookshelf in his study. It stood there, a brutalist monument of steel and leather amidst the delicate, gilded spines of his books. It looked utterly, hopelessly out of place. It looked, he thought with a sudden, sinking feeling, exactly like him. For the rest of the afternoon, he sat at his desk, the silence of the room restored, but it was no longer a comfort. It was the silence of a tomb. He tried to focus on his translation of a particularly dense passage about pommel-strikes, but his eyes kept drifting to the absurd object propped against the wall. He could still feel the phantom weight of it in his hands, and the memory of that quiet, observing gaze from over the fence.Dinner was a quiet affair, the clinking of cutlery against porcelain an inadequate substitute for conversation. Meredith, having successfully purged the aphids from her roses, had recovered her usual placid demeanour. She spoke of faculty meetings and the aggressive spread of a neighbour's bamboo, her voice a soothing balm that failed entirely to reach the knotted core of Alistair’s discontent. On the centre of the table, nestled between the salt and pepper shakers, sat the jar of Kalamata olives, now a third depleted. Alistair found he couldn’t look at it directly, but he was aware of it, a small glass monument to his own feebleness. He pushed a piece of chicken around his plate, the taste of it turning to ash in his mouth.

“Did you put your… thing… away?” Meredith asked, her tone carefully neutral. She was trying to build a bridge, he knew, but the chasm felt miles wide.

“It’s in the study,” he replied, his voice flat. “Leaning on the bookshelf dedicated to Carolingian ecclesiastical reforms. I thought it provided a certain… thematic dissonance.”

She gave a small, tired smile. “As long as it doesn’t fall and dent the floorboards. The last time you tried to move that bookshelf to dust behind it, you were laid up for a week with a bad back. A sword is just adding an element of slapstick to an already present danger.” She reached across the table, her hand briefly covering his. Her skin was warm, the calluses on her fingertips a testament to a life of tangible effort. “Just be careful, Aly. That’s all I ask.” The sincerity in her voice was almost worse than the mockery. It was the same tone she used when he climbed a stepladder to change a lightbulb, a gentle plea for him to acknowledge his own fragility.

Sleep, when he finally went to bed, was a shallow, restless sea. He kept drifting towards the shore of a dream where he was in a vast library, but all the books were bound in steel and he couldn't open a single one. Around three in the morning, he gave up. The silence of the house was different now, a private, nocturnal quiet that felt less judgmental. He padded, barefoot and ghost-like, into his study. In the moonlight filtering through the blinds, the feder was a sliver of darkness, absorbing the light. It was no longer a prop for a mid-life crisis; it was a question waiting for an answer.

He picked it up. This time, there was no thought of guards or postures. He simply held it in two hands, feeling the precise balance of it. He had read that a good sword should feel ‘lively’ in the hand, that its point of balance should make it feel lighter than it was. He let the tip dip towards the floor and then raised it slowly, concentrating only on the subtle shift of weight from the pommel to the crossguard, the way the mass of the blade pivoted just a few inches from his leading hand. It was a physical equation, a problem of leverage and mass. It was a language, he realised, not of words, but of force and motion. His arms still protested, but it was a dull, manageable ache now, not the sharp cry of over-stressed muscle.

His study window looked out over the back garden, and beyond it, the neighbouring properties. A single light was on in the house to his left, a small, bright square against the darkness. It was her window. The student, Chloe. The curtains were parted, and he could see a silhouette, a figure hunched over a desk, a scene he recognised with an academic's empathy. He was suddenly, acutely aware that he was standing in the dark, in his pyjamas, holding a five-foot sword. He felt a hot flush of shame and instinctively stepped back from the window, into the deeper shadows of the room. Yet, the image of that solitary light, of her quiet, studious vigil, didn't feel like an accusation. It felt like a strange, unspoken fellowship in the lonely hours of the night.

He lowered the sword and leaned it back against the bookshelf, but his perspective had shifted. He had approached this all wrong. He had tried to become the man in the manuscript, a figure of romance and martial prowess. But he was not Fiore dei Liberi. He was Professor Alistair Finch. He solved problems not with brute force, but with analysis, with deconstruction and patient, methodical study. He had tried to sprint before he could walk. The treatises didn’t just contain the grand flourishes; they were filled with the basics. Footwork. Grip. The simple, geometric lines of the cuts. He would not be a warrior overnight. But he could be a student. He could take this hostile, alien object and learn its grammar, one word at a time. The first mistake was the silence, he had thought. The second was thinking he had to fill it with a warrior’s cry, when all it really needed was a scholar’s question.The next morning was Sunday. Usually, this meant a slow, ritualistic progression through the weekend papers, accompanied by coffee and a sense of gentle dread about the coming week. But today, Alistair felt a new energy, a quiet thrum of anticipation that had nothing to do with caffeine. The shame of the previous afternoon had receded, replaced by a cool, clear sense of purpose. He wasn't a middle-aged man flailing in his backyard; he was a researcher embarking on a new project of kinetic philology. He would decode the manuscript not just with his eyes and his mind, but with his body. He would treat the *Flos Duellatorum* not as a manual for fantasy role-playing, but as a technical document, as precise and demanding as any of the Anglo-Saxon legal codes he'd spent his life untangling.

After breakfast, during which he was uncharacteristically silent but for a cheerful "Morning!" that made Meredith raise a quizzical eyebrow, he retreated to his study. He did not pick up the sword. The feder remained leaning against the bookshelf, a silent observer. Instead, he cleared a space in the centre of the room, pushing aside a worn armchair and rolling up the Persian rug. He then placed one of his heavy reference books on the floor—a facsimile of the Getty manuscript, open to the first pages which detailed the foundational principles of combat. The diagrams showed figures in simple stances, their feet placed with geometric precision. It was about stability, about the transfer of power from the ground up. The foundation. Fiore wrote that a man without footwork is like a house without a foundation; it will surely fall. Alistair, feeling his own foundations to be decidedly shaky, decided this was the only logical place to begin.

He took off his slippers, the cool floorboards a pleasant shock against the soles of his feet. He tried to mimic the first stance, the *posta breve*, the short guard. It was a simple posture, feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, weight centred. He felt ridiculous. He was a man accustomed to the controlled environment of a chair. Standing like this, poised for a movement that would not come, made every muscle feel alien and self-conscious. He held the pose for a minute, then two. His thighs began to burn. The text spoke of being "stable like a tower," but Alistair felt more like a jelly attempting to set. He wobbled, corrected, and held it, sweat beading on his brow not from exertion, but from sheer, unadulterated concentration. This was harder than translating Old High German. At least with a text, the syntax, however convoluted, stayed on the page.

He moved on to the next step: the simple passing step forward, the *passare*. According to the manual, one foot should pass the other smoothly, maintaining balance and keeping the body’s centre low. His first attempt was a lurch, a clumsy shuffle that ended with him stumbling into the side of his desk. He caught himself, his heart thudding. He took a breath. This was a data point, not a failure. He had overcommitted, leaned too far forward. He was thinking of it as 'taking a step' instead of 'transferring his centre of gravity'. He recalibrated, his mind clicking into its familiar analytical groove. He broke the movement down into its component parts: the slight unweighting of the back foot, the forward drive from the hip, the placement of the heel, the roll of the foot. He tried again. This time, it was slow, ponderous, and deeply ungraceful. But he didn't stumble. He ended the movement in balance, a mirror of the stance he had started in. A small, profound victory. He had just said his first word.

For the next hour, the study was silent save for the soft scuff of his bare feet on the floorboards and his own quiet, controlled breathing. He moved back and forth across the cleared space, a strange, halting dance between a fourteenth-century warrior and a twenty-first-century academic. He practiced the *passare* and its opposite, the *tornare*, the passing step backwards. He discovered muscles in his hips and core he hadn't known existed, and they sang a chorus of complaint. But it was a good pain, the pain of discovery, not the humiliating ache of failure. He was so engrossed in his task, so focused on the internal geometry of his own body, that he didn't hear the study door creak open.

“I thought I heard a trapped possum,” Meredith said. She was leaning against the doorframe, a mug of tea in her hands, her expression a careful mixture of curiosity and concern. “This is a new development. What are you doing now? Some kind of minimalist tai chi?”

Alistair froze mid-step, one foot hovering an inch above the floor. Caught again. But this time, the shame didn’t flood him. He felt exposed, certainly, but not humiliated. He slowly completed the step, placed his foot, and found his balance before turning to face her. “Footwork,” he said, his voice even. “According to Fiore, it’s the most important part. Everything else is built on this. I’m starting at the beginning.” He gestured to the open manuscript on the floor. “I’m just following the instructions.”

Meredith looked from the book to her husband, who was standing in his pyjamas, sweating slightly, in a fighting stance in the middle of his study. She took a sip of her tea. Her gaze lingered on the focused, almost serene expression on his face. It wasn't the manic, slightly wild look of a man chasing a new obsession. It was the look he got when he was wrestling with a particularly difficult piece of syntax, the look of deep, intellectual engagement. “Right,” she said, her voice lacking its earlier edge. “The beginning. Well, don’t strain anything. And try not to pass-are yourself right through the window.” She turned and left, pulling the door quietly shut behind her. Alistair stood for a moment in the renewed silence. It wasn’t a victory, not in the way one might win an argument. It was something quieter. It was acknowledgement. A space being made.The days that followed fell into a new rhythm. Alistair would wake before dawn, the house still wrapped in a deep, pre-light slumber, and slip into his study. There, in the growing grey light, he would practice. He was no longer a man in pyjamas, but a researcher in comfortable clothing, methodically working through his hypothesis. He danced his slow, deliberate dance, the scuff of his feet a soft percussive beat against the floorboards. The burning in his thighs became a familiar warmth. The awkwardness in his hips eased into a grudging flexibility. He was charting the unknown territory of his own body, mapping its limitations and discovering surprising pockets of strength. He felt the change not just in the study, but throughout his day. He found himself standing differently while waiting for the kettle to boil, more centred, more grounded. He took the stairs in the faculty building with a new economy of motion, his body a machine he was finally learning to operate.

After a week of this silent, solitary work, he felt ready. On a Tuesday morning, with Meredith already departed for a breakfast meeting, he took the feder from its corner. Its weight was familiar now, the leather of the grip conforming to his hand. He carried it outside, not to the centre of the lawn—that felt too much like a stage—but to the more secluded paved area of the back patio, partially hidden from the neighbours by Meredith’s trellised jasmine. The air was cool and clean. The world felt quiet, expectant. He set his feet in the *posta breve*, the feder held in a relaxed two-handed grip before him, its tip resting on the pavers. He was not a warrior preparing for battle; he was a scientist preparing to test a theory. The theory was simple: that the footwork was the engine, and the sword was merely the transmission.

He began to move. A slow *passare* forward, raising the blade into the high guard, the *posta frontale*. The movement was clumsy, the sword wobbling as his arms struggled to coordinate with his legs. But it didn't topple him. His feet, planted firmly, held him steady. He executed a *tornare*, a step back, letting the blade drop into a low guard, the *dente di cinghiale*, the boar’s tooth. He could feel the connection, a tenuous but undeniable thread of force running from the ground, through his legs and hips, up his spine, and out along his arms to the tip of the blade. He tried the *posta di donna* again, the guard that had so spectacularly defeated him before. He settled his feet, bent his knees, and brought the sword back over his right shoulder. It was heavy. His shoulder screamed a protest. But he held it. The pommel stayed clear of his head. The blade was angled correctly, poised and patient. He was a badly drawn sketch of the figure in the manuscript, but the lines were there. He was recognizable.

He was so lost in this new sensation, in the complex dialogue between muscle and steel, that the sound of a back door sliding open next door barely registered. He flowed, with agonising slowness, from the *posta di donna* to the *posta longa*, extending the sword out towards an imaginary opponent. His arms trembled with the effort. He was holding the pose, breathing through the strain, when a voice, quiet and clear, cut through the morning air.

“Your back foot is turning out too far. You’re losing power from your hips.”

Alistair froze, the point of the feder dipping towards the ground. The voice hadn't come from Meredith's garden, nor from the direction of Barry Henderson’s fortress of a pergola. It had come from the other side. From the small rental property. He turned his head slowly, the muscles in his neck stiff. The young woman, Chloe, was standing on her own small patio, a chipped ceramic mug cradled in her hands. She wore black leggings and an oversized, grey hoodie. Her expression wasn't mocking or pitying; it was analytical, the focused gaze of a diagnostician.

He straightened up, lowering the sword completely. He felt a blush creep up his neck, a familiar heat of being caught in his folly. “I… I beg your pardon?” he stammered, his carefully constructed composure shattering into a dozen pieces.

She took a small step forward, to the edge of her patio. “In your *passare*,” she clarified, her voice still quiet, as if not to startle him. “When you step forward, your back foot is rotating outwards. It breaks your structure. You want to keep it pointed mostly forward, so you can drive through the step. It’s a common mistake.” She took a sip from her mug, her eyes still on him, unwavering. Then she added, as if it were the most normal question in the world, “Are you studying from the Getty or the Pisani-Dossi?”

The question landed in the quiet patio with the force of a physical blow. Alistair’s mind, which a moment before had been a whirlwind of embarrassment, went utterly still. He stared at her. It was one thing for an observer to guess he was attempting some form of swordplay. It was another entirely for them to casually reference the specific manuscript traditions of a 15th-century martial arts treatise. It was like discussing the weather and having a stranger ask if you preferred the cumulus or the cumulonimbus.

“The Getty,” he finally managed to say, his voice a dry croak. “The facsimile. I’m a linguist. I’m translating it. I thought… I should understand the physical context.”

A small, genuine smile touched her lips for the first time. It transformed her serious face, making her look younger. “Kinesthetic empathy. I get it. I’m a history postgrad. My focus is on late medieval social structures, specifically guild law and training.” She gestured with her mug towards his feder. “Which included the *Fechtschulen*. The fencing schools. I used to train with a club in Melbourne before I moved up here for my PhD.” She paused, then took a step off her patio onto the damp grass of her own small yard. “Here, let me show you what I mean.”

She put her mug down and mirrored his stance, her body settling into it with a practiced ease that made Alistair’s own efforts look like a parody. “When you step,” she said, her voice taking on the patient tone of a good teacher, “think of it as falling forward, but you catch yourself with your front foot. The power comes from your core, from this drop. See?” She executed a perfect, fluid *passare*, her movement economical and balanced. Her back foot remained anchored, providing a stable platform for the entire motion. It was the illustration from the manuscript brought to life. "You're trying to muscle it with your arms. Fiore is all about the body. The sword just goes where the body tells it to."

Alistair watched, mesmerised. The shame was gone, replaced by a dizzying, electrifying sense of discovery. He was not alone. He was not a madman in a garden. He was a student who had just, by a sheer, dumb miracle, stumbled across a master. Or at the very least, a fellow traveler who was much, much further down the path. He looked from her effortless posture to the heavy, clumsy feder in his own hand. It no longer felt like a symbol of his inadequacy, or a rebellion against his life. It felt like a key. And someone had just walked up and shown him which way to turn it in the lock.### Chapter 2

The world seemed to shrink until it contained only the small patch of lawn between their two properties. The manicured flowerbeds, the looming fence, the distant hum of a lawnmower starting up—it all faded into an irrelevant background hum. Alistair stood, feder held loosely, watching as Chloe, the history postgrad, moved through the fundamental motion with an ease that was both beautiful and deeply intimidating. It was not the flashy, theatrical swordplay of cinema; it was economical, precise, and grounded. It was a physical argument, presented with irrefutable logic.

“I… see,” he said, the words feeling inadequate. He tried to replicate the movement, focusing on her instruction to ‘fall forward’. He took a step, concentrating on his core and the placement of his back foot. It was still awkward, a stuttering, clumsy motion, but for the first time, he felt the ghost of the connection she had described—the transfer of power from the ground. It was a fleeting, ephemeral sensation, but it was there. It was real.

Chloe nodded slowly, her diagnostician’s gaze missing nothing. “Better. You’re still thinking too much with your shoulders. Try to forget you’re even holding a sword. The movement is the same whether your hands are empty or full.” She walked back to her patio and retrieved her mug, signalling the end of the impromptu lesson. The quiet of the morning settled back in, but it was a different quiet now, filled with potential. “I’m usually out here around seven,” she said, her tone casual, but the offer was unmistakable. “Before it gets too humid.”

Alistair felt a surge of something he hadn’t experienced in years, a feeling that went beyond academic curiosity. It was the thrill of pure, unadulterated discovery, the kind he’d only ever found between the covers of a book. “Thank you,” he said, his voice earnest, stripped of its usual professorial irony. “That would be… that would be excellent.” She gave another small, acknowledging nod and disappeared back inside her house, leaving Alistair alone on his patio, the feder in his hand feeling less like an antagonist and more like a difficult, fascinating puzzle he had just been given the first clue to solving.

Their sessions began the very next day. It was a strange and secret fellowship. In the soft, forgiving light of early morning, before the neighbourhood was truly awake, they would meet in their respective backyards. Chloe had unearthed a *waster* from a long moving box—a wooden training sword of similar length and balance to Alistair’s feder. She would lead, and he would follow, a slow-motion mirror image across the dividing fence. She was a patient, exacting instructor. Her feedback was concise and technical. “Bend your knees more, Professor. You’re standing like you’re waiting for a bus.” “Don’t look at the sword; look at your target.” “Breathe. You’re holding your breath like you’re about to be quizzed on the subjunctive mood.”

He was, by any objective measure, a terrible student. His body, so long neglected, was a recalcitrant and clumsy instrument. He was stiff where he should be flexible, weak where he needed to be strong. But he was also a phenomenal learner. He approached the physical problems with the same rigorous, analytical mind that he applied to a damaged manuscript. He mentally catalogued her corrections, broke down each movement into its constituent parts, and practiced the components in his study at night until the muscle memory began, ever so slowly, to form. His initial aches and pains blossomed into a full-body chorus of complaint, but it was the satisfying soreness of labour, not the dispiriting ache of decay.

About a week into this new routine, Meredith came upon them. Alistair had been so focused on maintaining the *posta longa* without his arms trembling that he hadn't heard the back door slide open. Meredith stood on the patio, holding two mugs of coffee, her face a mask of utter astonishment. The scene before her was not her husband’s usual solitary, vaguely tragic flailing. It was a duet. Alistair and the young woman from next door were moving through a slow, deliberate sequence of steps and guards, a silent, shared choreography across the lawn.

“Good heavens,” she said, her voice cutting through the morning quiet. “It’s a cult. You’ve started a swords-before-breakfast cult.”

Alistair lowered his feder, his face flushing, but the familiar sting of shame didn’t come. Chloe simply relaxed her stance and gave Meredith a polite smile. “Morning, Mrs. Finch. The professor’s getting much better. He has excellent focus.”

“Professor,” Meredith repeated, a smile playing on her lips as she walked onto the lawn and handed a mug to Alistair. His hand, she noted, was steady as he took it. “So this is a formal lesson? You’ve outsourced your mid-life crisis to a professional?” The jibe was there, but the edge was gone, replaced by a genuine, sparkling curiosity.

“Chloe is a postgraduate in the history department,” Alistair explained, finding he was standing taller, his shoulders back. “Her specialty overlaps with Fiore’s work. She’s been… correcting my form.”

Meredith looked from her husband, sweaty and breathing heavily but with a clear, alert look in his eye, to the quiet, self-possessed young woman standing on the other side of the fence. She looked at the two practice swords, the focused intensity of the scene she’d interrupted. It was still absurd, but it was a shared, purposeful absurdity. It had structure. “Well,” she said, taking a sip of her own coffee, “it’s an improvement on the mead. That just gave the laundry a medieval stench. This is much more… cinematic.” She gave Chloe a warm smile. “Any chance you do discounts for spousal referrals? I have some aphids that could use a good skewering.”

The dynamic of the lessons deepened. They were no longer just physical sessions. Afterwards, panting and drinking water, they would conduct impromptu seminars across the fence. Alistair, holding his copy of the facsimile, would point to a particularly obtuse line of Italian. “Here, Fiore says the Fifth Master’s blow arrives ‘like a thunderbolt that cannot be broken.’ It’s always struck me as poetic hyperbole.”

Chloe would nod, process the phrase, and then demonstrate. “It’s not the speed,” she’d explain, executing a powerful but controlled cut that flowed directly from her footwork. “It’s the structure. If you’re properly aligned, the blow lands with your entire body mass behind it. There’s no point in its arc where it’s weak enough to ‘break’ or intercept easily. It’s an engineering metaphor, not a poetic one.”

The words on the page lit up in Alistair’s mind. A dozen similar passages suddenly clicked into place. In return, he offered her his own expertise. When she struggled to understand why Fiore structured his book in a specific, seemingly illogical order, Alistair could explain the scholastic traditions of categorization and memory that would have been second nature to a 14th-century master. He could trace the etymology of a single word back through three languages to reveal a hidden layer of meaning. They were two halves of a single project, a linguist and a practitioner, piecing together a forgotten world. He was learning the body of the art, and she, its soul. The silence that had once defined his mistake had been filled, not with the clang of steel, but with the quiet, thrilling hum of collaborative discovery.### Chapter 3

The early mornings took on the comfortable rhythm of a cherished ritual. It had been over a month since Chloe’s impromptu intervention, and the space between the two houses had become a *dojo* delineated by property lines and dew-damp grass. Alistair’s movements, once the clumsy thrashing of a drowning man, had acquired a nascent, hesitant grace. The trembling in his arms had been replaced by a deep, resonant strength that hummed in his bones long after the practice was over. They had moved beyond static postures into the flowing sequences of the art itself. The air was no longer silent, but punctuated by the soft *shiff* of their feet on the grass and the sharp, woody *clack* as Chloe’s waster met Alistair’s feder in a simple parry. It was a conversation in the language of motion, a question and answer spoken with steel and wood.

This new physical vocabulary had begun to translate back into his work with an astonishing clarity. The treatises were no longer just collections of words and diagrams; they were alive. When Fiore wrote of breaking the thrust with an ‘increase and a strike’, Alistair could now feel the precise torque in his hips and the transfer of weight required to make it a reality. He saw the geometry of the art not as an abstract concept, but as a set of physical laws governing the intersection of two bodies in time and space. He felt closer to the 14th-century master than ever before, a student reaching across six centuries, the vellum no longer a barrier but a bridge. The quiet of his study was different now; it was the quiet of a workshop, filled with the potential for action, the silent feder in the corner less a monument and more a tool waiting to be used.

One Saturday morning, they were working on the *colpo di villano*, a powerful, descending cut from the side. Alistair was concentrating on keeping his own blow from being over-extended, a common beginner’s mistake that left one dangerously exposed. He stepped, turned his hips, and let the feder fall, pulling the cut short with his back muscles as Chloe had instructed. He ended the motion in a stable guard, breathing evenly, his gaze fixed on his imaginary opponent. It was the best one he’d managed all morning, and a small spark of pride ignited within him. It was at that precise moment of quiet triumph that a new sound intruded: the metallic groan of a side-gate latch.

Alistair’s focus dissolved. He turned his head, his body stiffening. It was Barry Henderson. He wore a stained singlet and grubby work shorts, and was carrying a cordless drill with the easy familiarity a scholar might afford a favourite pen. He had come around to inspect the shared fence, and had stopped dead, his broad, sun-reddened face a picture of pure bewilderment. He looked at Alistair, then at Chloe on the other side of the fence, then back at the five-foot length of steel in Alistair’s hands. The old shame, the familiar, gut-wrenching dread of being seen as a fool, surged in Alistair’s throat. He could feel Barry’s imagined judgment like a physical weight, the same condescending pity he had dreaded from the beginning. His first instinct was to drop the sword, to mumble something about gardening tools, to retreat into the safety of his house.

But he didn't. He felt the solid ground under his feet. He felt the taught alignment of his spine, the weight of the sword balanced in his hands. Chloe hadn't moved, her waster held in a relaxed but ready guard, her expression unreadable. Alistair took a slow breath, the kind he used before beginning a difficult sequence, and held his ground. He was no longer a man trying to scratch an itch with a piece of scaffolding. He was a student of the *arte dell’armizare*. The thought, clear and simple, was a shield.

“G’day, Alistair,” Barry finally said, his voice a low rumble. He gestured with his drill towards the feder. “Bit of a step up from the whipper-snipper, mate. What’s all this, then?” His tone wasn’t mocking. It was genuinely, straightforwardly curious, the way a man who understands tools might inquire about an unfamiliar one.

Alistair found his voice. It was steadier than he expected. “Morning, Barry. It’s a historical martial art. A reconstruction of 14th-century Italian longsword fighting.” He said the words simply, without apology or bravado. They were just facts.

Barry’s thick eyebrows rose. He looked at Chloe, who gave a brief, polite nod. “Right,” he said, processing this information. He glanced at Alistair’s arms, and at the feder, then back at Alistair's face, which was beaded with sweat from exertion, not panic. “Looks like hard yakka.” He squinted up at the sky. “Gonna be a hot one. Don’t want to get yourself dehydrated doing… that.” He gave a final, conclusive nod, as if he had successfully categorized this bizarre activity under ‘weird but strenuous hobbies’, and turned his attention to a loose paling on the fence. The great, looming spectre of Barry Henderson’s scorn had revealed itself to be nothing more than a mildly curious neighbour. The confrontation Alistair had dreaded for weeks was over before it had even begun, defeated not by a display of martial prowess, but by a simple, factual sentence.As Barry's drill whirred to life, biting into the timber, the sound seemed to stitch the morning back together. The spell was broken. Alistair let out a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding, the tension draining from his shoulders. He felt strangely light. Chloe, on her side of the fence, gave a barely perceptible shrug, a small gesture that said, *See? The world didn't end.*

“He called it ‘hard yakka’,” Alistair said, a slow smile spreading across his face. He tested the Australian slang on his tongue, a foreign word he’d just learned the true meaning of.

“It is,” Chloe replied simply. She brought her waster up into a high guard. “Now, the *villano*. Again. This time, imagine you’re striking down onto a shield. Don’t let your blade go past the point of impact. Control the recovery.”

Alistair nodded, setting his feet. He faced his imaginary opponent once more, but the opponent was no longer a shadowy figure of judgment. It was just an empty space, waiting to be filled with purpose and intention. The dread was gone, and in its place, a clear, sharp focus. He moved, and the sword followed, a single, unified expression of will. The fear he had carried for weeks had been a ghost of his own making, and it had vanished in the bright, unforgiving light of a Saturday morning.

Later that afternoon, the sun was high and hot, beating down with the full force of a Queensland summer day. Alistair sat in the shade of the patio with a book, but he wasn’t reading. He was watching Meredith, who was engaged in one of her periodic, large-scale reorganizations of the garden. She was struggling with a large, ornate terracotta pot that housed a now-rootbound lemon myrtle. It was a beast of a thing, dark with moisture and ridiculously heavy. She had her hands hooked under the lip, her back bent at a dangerous angle, grunting with effort. The pot refused to budge, seemingly fused to the paving stones.

“This infernal thing,” she grunted, straightening up and putting her hands on her hips, her face flushed. “It’s decided to become a permanent geological feature.”

Alistair put his book down. A few months ago, he would have offered a sympathetic murmur and perhaps the unhelpful suggestion to ‘wait until it dries out’. He would have known any attempt he made to move it would result in either failure or a pulled muscle, or both. But now, he saw it not as a test of brute strength, but as a problem of leverage and body mechanics. He walked over, his bare feet cool on the hot pavers. “Let me try,” he said.

Meredith gave him a dubious look, the one she usually reserved for his attempts at DIY. “Aly, it’s solid. Don’t hurt yourself. We can ask Barry to help later.”

The mention of Barry didn’t even cause a flicker of the old inadequacy. “Just let me try,” he repeated. He crouched down, ignoring the lip of the pot. Instead, he worked his fingers underneath the base, getting as low as he possibly could. He bent his knees deeply, keeping his back straight, his head up. It was the foundation of every guard he had practiced, the stability of the tower Fiore wrote about. He wasn't lifting with his arms; he was preparing to drive with his legs, to use his entire body as a lever. He took a breath, settled his weight, and then pushed the ground away with his feet.

The pot lifted. It wasn't a sudden, jarring hoist, but a smooth, powerful unsticking. The bottom scraped against the pavers as he straightened his legs, the immense weight flowing up through his core and held steady by his aligned frame. He took two slow, controlled *passare* steps backwards, moving the pot clear of its long-held position, and then lowered it with the same deliberation, bending his knees until it rested safely on the ground. He stood up, breathing a little heavily but feeling no strain in his back, only the deep, satisfying warmth of engaged muscle.

Meredith was staring. Her mouth was slightly open. She wasn’t looking at the pot; she was looking at him, at the way he had moved. There was no pity in her gaze now, no gentle mockery. There was just a profound, unadulterated surprise, as if a familiar piece of furniture in her house had suddenly revealed a completely new and unexpected function. She slowly reached out and touched his arm, her soil-dusted fingers resting on the firm muscle of his forearm. “Good heavens, Alistair,” she said, her voice quiet with wonder. “All that… swashbuckling. It’s actually… useful.”

He smiled, a real, unburdened smile. He looked down at his hands, the ink-stained scholar’s hands. They didn't feel alien anymore. They felt like his. That evening, as he sat in his study, the last of the evening light casting long shadows across the room, his eyes fell upon the feder leaning in its corner. It no longer looked out of place among his books. It looked like it belonged. It was a key, not to a fantasy of knighthood, but to a part of himself he had forgotten existed. It hadn't taught him how to fight; it had taught him how to stand, how to move, how to occupy the physical space of his own life with confidence and purpose. The first mistake had been the silence, the vast, yawning quiet he had felt compelled to fill. But he had been wrong. The silence hadn't been an absence. It had been an invitation. And in learning the grammar of steel, he had finally learned to answer it.### Chapter 4

The change in Meredith was, to Alistair, perhaps the most profound and disorienting outcome of his new pursuit. Her initial mixture of pity and exasperation had given way to a quiet, supportive curiosity. She no longer referred to his feder as ‘his thing’, but called it by its name. She had even, on a rainy Saturday, sat with him in his study and asked him to explain the difference between the Getty and Pisani-Dossi manuscripts, listening with genuine interest as he spoke of provenance and diverging interpretations. The chasm that had opened between them over the jar of olives had been bridged, and the architect of that bridge, improbably, was a five-foot length of steel. She often brought them glasses of iced water after their morning sessions, standing on the patio to watch them run through a sequence, her gardener’s eye appreciating the economy of motion, the focused, disciplined energy of it all.

Their practice had evolved. They had moved from the grammar of single steps and guards to the syntax of the plays themselves. They would work through one of Fiore’s remedies, a set sequence of attack, parry, and counter-attack. Alistair would initiate a slow, telegraphed strike; Chloe would meet it, displacing his blade and flowing into a disarm or a counter-cut, talking him through the mechanics of it. “Feel that? My blade isn’t stopping yours, it’s just redirecting it. Now your line is open here, and I have the advantage.” It was a physical chess match, and Alistair, a man who had lived his life in the abstract, was beginning to think several moves ahead with his body.

The catalyst arrived on a Thursday morning, tucked into an email. After their session, as they stood cooling down on their respective lawns, Chloe swiped through her phone, her brow furrowed. “Huh,” she said. “The Queensland Historical Society is putting on their annual ‘Journey Through Time’ fair at the showgrounds next month. My PhD supervisor just forwarded a call for demonstrators.” She looked up from her phone, her gaze meeting Alistair’s over the fence. There was a glint in her eye he was beginning to recognize, the spark of an academic who scents a new research opportunity. “They’re looking for a HEMA group to do a demonstration and talk. Specifically late medieval.”

Alistair felt an immediate, cold plunge in his stomach, as if he’d missed a step on a dark staircase. The comfortable, private world of their two-person dojo suddenly felt fragile, threatened by the intrusion of a wider world. “Absolutely not,” he said, the words coming out more forcefully than he intended. “I’m not a… a historical re-enactor. I’m not going to dress up in tights and pretend to be a knight for a crowd of children eating fairy floss.” The image was mortifying, a regression to a level of public foolishness he had only just managed to escape.

“It wouldn’t be like that,” Chloe countered, her tone reasonable. “It’s a demonstration. Educational. We’d explain the manuscript, show the guards, walk through a few of the core plays. It’s what we do every morning, just with a microphone. Think of it as a kinetic presentation of our research.” She smiled. “It’s one thing to publish a paper that ten people will read. It’s another to show a hundred people that this isn't just fantasy, it’s a sophisticated, documented martial science.”

The logic was sound, infuriatingly so. It appealed directly to his academic pride. But the visceral fear of being on display, of being judged by strangers, was overwhelming. “No,” he said again, shaking his head. “I’m a linguist. I work with texts. This… this is for me. It’s a personal project.” He felt the old defensiveness creeping back, the familiar urge to retreat to the safety of his book-lined study. The silence he had come to master felt threatened by the imagined noise of a crowd.

It was then that Meredith, who had been quietly watering a pot of petunias on the patio, spoke up. “I think you should do it, Alistair.” He turned to her, expecting to see a flicker of amusement, a hint of the old mockery. There was none. Her expression was entirely serious. “Chloe’s right. It’s a presentation. You give presentations all the time at conferences. You stand up in front of rooms full of your peers and dissect obscure syntax. What’s the difference?”

“The difference,” he sputtered, “is that I’m not usually holding a weapon and at risk of tripping over my own feet in front of them!”

“But you don’t trip over your feet anymore,” Meredith said simply. She put down her watering can and walked towards him. “I’ve been watching you, Aly. You’re not the man who was terrified of the stepladder. You know what you’re doing.” She looked at him, her gaze clear and direct. “You’ve spent your entire life explaining dead worlds to people through words. For the first time, you have the chance to actually show them something. To make it real. Don’t you see what an incredible opportunity that is?”

He stood, caught between them, a student being gently but firmly prodded by his two, very different, mentors. He looked at Chloe’s expectant, analytical face, and at his wife’s surprisingly fierce expression of belief. They saw something in him that he was still struggling to see in himself. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his gut, but for the first time, it was accompanied by a different feeling: a flicker of genuine, terrifying excitement. He looked at the feder in his hand, its weight a solid, reassuring presence. It had taken him this far. He thought of the endless, silent afternoons in the library, of the chasm between the men he studied and the man he was. That chasm had been shrinking, day by day. Perhaps it was time to see if he could walk across it.

“Alright,” he heard himself say, his voice barely a whisper. Then, more firmly, he cleared his throat. “Alright. We’ll do it.”### Chapter 4

The word ‘alright’ hung in the morning air, fragile as a spider’s web. Alistair felt as though he had stepped off a cliff, trusting that the ground would somehow rise to meet him. The immediate aftermath was a strange mix of nauseating panic and a sharp, exhilarating clarity. He had committed himself. The private, scholarly pursuit had broken its containment field and was now set on a collision course with the public. Yet, as he and Chloe packed away their practice weapons, a new dynamic settled between them. They were no longer just a teacher and a student; they were collaborators, co-conspirators in an impending act of public scholarship. The shared goal, however terrifying, forged a new and potent kind of alliance.

Their first official planning session took place that afternoon, not across the fence, but together on Alistair’s patio. Meredith had insisted, bringing out a pitcher of iced tea and a plate of lemon biscuits as if they were planning a faculty picnic rather than a martial arts demonstration. The juxtaposition was jarring, but also strangely calming. Alistair, armed with a notepad and his favourite fountain pen, found himself slipping into a familiar role. He began to structure a narrative, a spoken framework that would give context to their movements. He would open with the rediscovery of the manuscripts, explaining their significance as historical documents, not fantasy novels. He would be the voice, the academic anchor. Chloe, in turn, mapped out the physical demonstration. She selected a series of plays that were visually clear, safe to perform, and illustrated the core principles of the art: the importance of the guards, the logic of the parry-riposte, and the way the entire system was built upon the foundation of footwork. They were designing a lecture, but the visual aids would be made of steel.

The tenor of their morning sessions shifted overnight. The exploratory, almost meditative quality was replaced by a focused, repetitive precision. They were no longer just practicing, they were rehearsing. They ran through the chosen sequences again and again, their movements becoming sharper, more synchronised. The soft *clack* of wood on steel became a rhythmic, predictable beat. Chloe was a demanding director. “No, Professor, you’re anticipating the parry. You have to commit to the attack, make me believe it.” Alistair, in turn, would sometimes pause them mid-sequence. “Hold. When we explain the *posta di donna* here, I need to connect it to Fiore’s self-description as a scholar. The waiting posture, the gathering of potential energy before the decisive action. It helps the narrative.” They were weaving their two disciplines together, creating a performance that was both physically and intellectually coherent.

Meredith became their unwitting test audience. She would watch from the patio while sipping her morning coffee, her initial amusement having matured into a keen, critical eye. “That part where you two move together looks good,” she commented one morning, “like a proper dance. But when you were explaining the bit about the boar’s tooth, Alistair, you were staring at the ground. You looked like you’d lost a contact lens. Look at your audience. Or at least, look at the prize-winning roses.” Her feedback, devoid of any technical jargon, was invaluable. She saw what a layperson would see: not the subtle mechanics of a disarm, but the confidence, or lack thereof, in the person demonstrating it. Under her direction, Alistair learned to project his voice, to hold his shoulders back even when he was explaining something, to occupy the space not just as a fighter, but as a presenter.

Sleep, however, remained a contested territory. In the quiet of the night, Alistair’s confidence would evaporate, leaving behind a cold residue of dread. He would lie awake and picture a hundred scenarios of humiliation: his voice cracking, his foot slipping on a stray piece of popcorn, the sword feeling suddenly alien and heavy in his hand, a prop in a farce he had foolishly agreed to star in. The imagined faces of the crowd, a mixture of boredom and derision, would loom in the darkness. But instead of letting the panic consume him, he began to use the tools Chloe had given him. He would focus on his breathing, slow and deep, from the diaphragm. He would mentally walk through the first guard, the *posta breve*, feeling the imaginary ground under his feet, the stability of the tower. He was using the discipline of the body to tame the anxieties of the mind. He was, he realised one night, parrying his own fear.

The weekend before the fair, they staged a full dress rehearsal in Alistair’s backyard. They had agreed on a simple, functional costume: dark, comfortable trousers and plain, loose-fitting linen shirts that hinted at a historical context without being theatrical. As they began, Alistair saw Barry Henderson emerge next door to empty grass clippings into his compost bin. Barry paused, watched for a full minute as Chloe and Alistair moved through a synchronised cutting drill, then gave a slow, deliberate thumbs-up before turning back to his work. The gesture was a small thing, but it landed on Alistair with the force of a benediction. The run-through was their best yet. The narrative flowed, the movements were clean, and for the first time, Alistair felt a spark of genuine performance energy, the thrill of sharing something he had come to love. When they finished, panting and sweating in the midday sun, Meredith applauded from the patio. “Well,” she declared with a broad smile. “I’d pay to see that. You might finally be more interesting than the petting zoo.”

The night before the Journey Through Time fair was unnaturally still. The usual suburban hum had died down, leaving a profound silence that reminded Alistair of that first Saturday afternoon. He stood in his study, the simple linen shirt and trousers for the next day laid out neatly on his armchair. In the centre of the room, he had placed the feder, cleaned and lightly oiled, its steel gleaming softly in the lamplight. It did not look like an instrument of violence or a symbol of a mid-life crisis. It looked like a key. He ran a hand over the leather grip, the texture now as familiar as the spine of a beloved book. The fear was not gone; it was a low thrum beneath the surface, a bass note of anxiety. But it was no longer the dominant melody. It was background noise. The dominant feeling was a quiet, solid readiness. He had studied the text, he had learned the grammar, and he had practiced the movements. Tomorrow, he wouldn't be pretending to be a warrior. He would be what he had always been: a scholar, standing up to share what he had learned.The morning of the fair dawned aggressively bright and clear, the kind of Toowoomba day that felt scrubbed clean and polished to a high sheen. Alistair awoke before his alarm, the silence in the bedroom a blank canvas onto which his anxieties immediately began to paint lurid scenes of failure. He saw himself fumbling the feder, his voice squeaking into the microphone, his carefully constructed intellectual authority collapsing into public farce. He lay still, feeling the familiar cold knot of dread tighten in his stomach. But then, almost without conscious thought, he began to breathe. Not the shallow, panicked gasps of his old anxieties, but the slow, deep, diaphragmatic breaths he had practiced for weeks. He focused on the feeling of the mattress supporting his weight, the stability of it. He was grounding himself, even in bed. By the time Meredith stirred beside him, the knot had not vanished, but it had loosened into a manageable thrum.

The drive to the showgrounds was a surreal journey through the mundane. The familiar suburban streets, the traffic lights, the Saturday morning shoppers—it all seemed to belong to a different, safer reality than the one he was driving towards. Chloe sat in the passenger seat, calm and composed, scrolling through her presentation notes on her phone. Alistair gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white, his own carefully scripted opening lines replaying in a frantic loop in his head. Meredith followed in her own car, having refused to ride with them. "You two need to get into your 'zone'," she had said, a statement so incongruous with her usual vocabulary that it made Alistair almost smile. His zone felt less like a place of focused power and more like a small, rattling cage.

Finding their designated spot was a further exercise in dislocation. It was a squarish patch of grass roped off next to a group of cheerful-looking people demonstrating spinning and weaving, and across from a tent promising ‘Authentic Pioneer Damper’. The air was thick with the competing smells of woodsmoke, frying onions, and the faint but unmistakable aroma of the petting zoo down the hill. Children shrieked with delight, a PA system crackled with announcements for a lost child, and in the midst of it all, Alistair and Chloe set up a small table, placing the weighty facsimile of the *Flos Duellatorum* upon it like a sacred text on a makeshift altar. He felt hideously conspicuous in his plain linen shirt, a fraudulent historical artifact amidst the glorious chaos of a modern country fair.

As the designated time approached, a small crowd began to coagulate. It was a motley assortment: a few families with restless children, a cluster of teenagers wearing expressions of ironic detachment, and a handful of genuinely curious adults. Alistair’s heart hammered against his ribs. He looked at Chloe, who gave him a small, sharp nod. It was time. He walked to the microphone stand, his legs feeling like they were made of damp cardboard. The metal of the stand was cold and solid under his trembling hand. He took a breath, letting it out slowly. He bent his knees slightly, finding his centre, just as he would before beginning a drill. He looked out, not at the blur of faces, but past them, towards Meredith’s prize-winning roses, as she had coached him.

“Good morning,” he began, and was relieved to hear his own voice, amplified and slightly tinny, but steady. “My name is Professor Alistair Finch, and this is Chloe Aster. We are here today not to show you a sword fight, but to introduce you to a lost science.” He found his rhythm then, the familiar cadence of the lecture hall taking over. He spoke of the vellum manuscripts, of Fiore dei Liberi, a master of combat but also a scholar and a man of his time. He was not just waving a sword; he was opening a book, translating its dense, forgotten language for them. The teenagers stopped smirking. The parents pulled their children a little closer. He was drawing them in with the one tool he had always mastered: words.

He stepped back from the microphone, his part of the introduction done, and picked up the feder. The worn leather of the grip felt like a handshake from an old friend. He and Chloe faced each other in the centre of their grassy stage. The fair’s cacophony seemed to recede, creating a pocket of intense quiet. They began with the guards, moving through them in a slow, synchronised flow. The *posta breve*, stable and waiting; the *posta di donna*, coiled with potential energy; the *dente di cinghiale*, aggressive and low. There were no theatrics, no cries or grunts, only the whisper of their feet on the grass and the intent in their posture. Then came the plays. Alistair initiated a slow, deliberate cut. Chloe met it not with force, but with a subtle deflection, the *clack* of steel on steel sharp and clean. Her blade slid along his, controlling its path, and in a fluid, undeniable motion, she had placed the point of her feder inches from his chest. They held the pose for a beat, a living tableau from the manuscript.

They moved through another sequence, this time a defence against a thrust. Alistair lunged, and Chloe, with a single, economical step to the side—the *passare* he had struggled with for so long—was out of the line of attack, her own blade now threatening his exposed side. It was a physical demonstration of geometry and timing, a problem and a solution executed in three seconds. The crowd was utterly still. The restless children were watching, their mouths slightly agape, seeing not violence but a complex and fascinating dance. They finished with a short, rapid exchange of cuts and parries, ending with their blades crossed and locked at the hilt, the *gioco stretto* that Fiore had written of with such intimacy. In the silence that followed, a bead of sweat rolled from Alistair’s temple and dripped onto the crossguard of his sword. Then, the applause started. It wasn’t a roar, but it was solid, respectful, and sustained. A man in a work shirt in the front row caught Alistair’s eye and gave him a slow, appreciative nod.

The adrenaline began to fade as they answered questions, leaving a profound and deeply satisfying calm in its wake. A young girl with bright, intelligent eyes asked if the crossguard was just for protecting the hands or if you could hit someone with it, a question so perfectly aligned with Fiore’s section on pommel and crossguard strikes that Alistair found himself beaming as he explained it. When the crowd finally dispersed, he and Chloe stood for a moment in the sudden quiet of their small, roped-off world. He was exhausted, drenched in sweat, and happier than he had been in years. Meredith appeared, holding three cups of lemonade, her face shining with a pride that was so open and undisguised it almost made his eyes sting. “Well,” she said, handing him a cup. “You didn’t trip.” Her simple words were the highest praise he could have imagined. He took a long drink of the cold, sweet lemonade, the taste of it washing away the last vestiges of his fear. He hadn’t become a knight in shining armour. He had become himself, a scholar who had learned to speak a new language, and in doing so, had found his own voice.### Chapter 5

The drive home from the showgrounds was a study in quietude. The chaotic energy of the fair—the tinny music, the scent of sugar and sawdust, the press of the crowd—receded behind them, leaving a bubble of peaceful exhaustion in its place. The feder, wrapped in an old blanket, lay in the boot like a sleeping dragon, its energy spent. Alistair drove with a lightness in his arms and shoulders he hadn’t thought possible, his hands resting easily on the wheel. He felt hollowed out, but in the way of a bell after it has been rung, still humming with a clean, resonant vibration. Meredith sat beside him this time, her hand resting on the centre console, her thumb occasionally tracing a small circle. Chloe was silent in the back seat, the day’s exertion having finally caught up with her. It was a comfortable, shared silence, the polar opposite of the vast, oppressive quiet that had started his journey. This silence was a destination, a place of mutual understanding earned through shared effort.

When they pulled into the driveway, the familiar facade of the house seemed subtly altered, as if viewed through a new lens. It looked less like a fortress to hide within and more like a home to return to. Unpacking was a smooth, wordless operation. Alistair carried the heavy facsimile and the swords in one trip, his body moving with an unthinking competence. As he passed Meredith in the hallway, she reached out and brushed a stray piece of grass from his shoulder. “You’ve got showground on you,” she said, her voice soft, but her eyes were bright with a smile that went far beyond the simple words. It was an acknowledgment, a validation more profound than any applause. Later, in the kitchen, she handed him a jar of chutney she’d been given by a neighbour. “Could you?” she asked, her tone neutral. The lid was screwed on tight. He took it, planted his feet, gave a short, sharp twist from his core, and the seal popped with a satisfying *thwock*. He handed it back to her, and the look that passed between them was a silent conversation, a final, quiet closing of the chapter that had begun with a jar of olives.

The new normal asserted itself the following Monday morning. The alarm went off in the pre-dawn darkness, and Alistair rose with an ache in his muscles that felt more like a memory of accomplishment than a complaint. Out on the patio, the air was cool and still. When Chloe appeared on her side of the fence, waster in hand, there was a different quality to their greeting. The frantic, goal-oriented pressure of the past weeks was gone. They moved through their warm-ups with a relaxed familiarity, the joy of the practice returning to the forefront. Yet, after they ran through a complex play, a sense of anticlimax lingered in the air. The purpose that had driven them so hard was now a success in the rearview mirror. Chloe voiced it first, resting the tip of her waster on the grass. “So,” she said, her breath pluming slightly. “What now?”

The question was simple, but it hung between them, vast and unanswered. What now? Continue their private study? Delve deeper into the more obscure sections of the manuscript? The path forward, once a straight line to the fair, had dissolved into a dozen branching possibilities. Alistair had no answer. He was content, for the first time in a long time, to simply exist in this new state of being, to enjoy the practice for its own sake. The idea of setting another daunting goal was exhausting. He was about to say as much when Chloe’s expression shifted. “I think,” she said slowly, “the question may have just answered itself.” She was looking past him, towards the house. Alistair turned to see Meredith standing at the open screen door, holding Alistair’s tablet. “You have an email, Aly,” she said, her voice carrying an unusual note of intrigue. “From a ‘Robert Marshall’. He says he was the man in the front row with his son. The one who asked about the pommel strikes.”

Alistair walked over and took the tablet, his brow furrowed in curiosity. He read the email aloud, his voice growing more hesitant with each line. Robert Marshall, an IT project manager with a passion for history, had been completely captivated by their demonstration. More specifically, his fourteen-year-old son, who had previously shown interest only in video games, was now obsessed with the idea of learning ‘real sword fighting’. The email was polite, respectful, and ended with a question that landed like a dropped stone in the quiet morning. “I know this is a long shot,” Alistair read, “but would you ever consider taking on students? My son and I would be your first and most dedicated pupils. There were a couple of other dads I spoke to afterwards who were also incredibly impressed and would be keen as well.”

Alistair lowered the tablet, a cold wave of panic washing away the morning’s peace. It was one thing to perform a carefully rehearsed script for a transient crowd. It was another thing entirely to take on the responsibility of teaching. The variables, the risks, the sheer presumption of it, were overwhelming. “No,” he said, the word a reflex. “Absolutely not. I’m a beginner myself. I’m not an instructor. It’s not safe. This is a private study, not… not a business.” He looked to Chloe for backup, but she was watching him with a thoughtful, unreadable expression. He felt the need to reinforce his refusal. “We can’t have strangers traipsing through the backyard. It’s… unprofessional. It’s an insurance nightmare.” He was building a fortress of logic, but he could feel the foundations trembling.

Chloe finally spoke, her voice measured. “Is it, though? Fiore’s own school, his *compagnia*, was built on personal instruction. Masters and scholars passing on their knowledge. What we’re doing is already a reconstruction of that. Taking on students would be the next logical step in the research.” She leaned against the fence, her argument as clean and precise as one of her parries. “We wouldn’t be teaching them advanced plays. We’d be teaching them what you learned first. Stance. Footwork. Safety. The absolute basics. It’s a chance to see if our understanding of the pedagogy actually works on complete novices. It’s a research opportunity, Professor.” She used his title deliberately, appealing to the scholar, not the swordsman. It was a cunning and effective blow.

Before Alistair could formulate a response, Meredith stepped onto the patio, taking the tablet from his hand. “He’s offering to pay, you know,” she said, scrolling to the bottom of the email. “And he says they’re happy to sign any waivers. He just wants his son to have a hobby that doesn’t involve a screen.” She looked up, her gaze moving from Alistair’s conflicted face to the pristine, circular lawn he had once defended so jealously against clover. “You’ve been given a gift, Alistair. You found something that changed you. Now a handful of people are asking you to share a little bit of it. It’s not an insurance nightmare; it’s a compliment. A big one.” She gestured to the open space. “And you’ve got the perfect place for it. Heaven knows, it’s better than you just frowning at it.”

He was cornered, flanked by two perfectly logical arguments and the undeniable truth of his own transformation. The thought was still terrifying. He pictured a class of clumsy beginners, the potential for injury, the erosion of the quiet, personal world he had built with Chloe. But he also pictured the boy’s face, rapt and attentive in the front row. He saw the earnest, hopeful words of the father’s email. The first mistake had been the silence. Now, a new kind of silence descended, one filled not with inadequacy, but with the weight of an unexpected and profound choice. He looked at the feder, which he had leaned against the wall. It had led him out of his study and into the world. Now, the world was knocking, asking to be let in.Alistair stood in the epicentre of their expectations, a silent fulcrum upon which the next stage of his life was balanced. He looked at the lawn, the perfectly circular patch of Sir Walter buffalo grass. A month ago, it had been a symbol of his manicured, sterile existence, a space he defended from the chaos of nature. Now it bore the faint scars of his footwork, the thin lines carved by the tip of his feder, the scuff marks of his morning dance with Chloe. It was no longer a pristine monument; it was a workshop floor. To deny its use now, to lock the gate and retreat back into the hushed sanctity of his study, felt like a profound and pathetic act of regression. It would be an admission that his journey was merely a personal vanity, a brief holiday from himself. It would be a betrayal of the man who had learned to move the pot, the man who had stood before a crowd and spoken with a clear voice. It would be, he realised with sudden clarity, a far greater mistake than the silence had ever been.

He let out a slow breath, the air leaving his lungs feeling like a final sigh of the man he used to be. He looked at Chloe, whose expression held the keen anticipation of a scientist about to test a hypothesis. Then he looked at Meredith, whose face was alight with a fierce, unwavering belief he was only just beginning to accept he deserved. “Alright,” he said, the word feeling both terrifyingly large and perfectly simple. “Tell them to come on Saturday morning. Nine o’clock. But they have to understand… we start at the beginning. With the feet.”

The following Saturday morning felt like a strange echo of the day of the fair. The same nervous energy crackled in the air, but this time, the crowd was coming to him. At precisely nine, the side-gate latched open, and Robert Marshall entered, a tall man with the slightly stooped posture of a desk worker. Beside him was his son, Leo, a lanky fourteen-year-old with a thatch of unruly dark hair and the cautious, watchful eyes of a teenager perpetually braced for embarrassment. They were followed by two other men Robert had recruited: Mark, a stocky, cheerful plumber with calloused hands who looked like he could wrestle a bear, and David, a slight, bespectacled accountant who seemed, if possible, even more nervous than Alistair. Chloe had sourced four simple wooden wasters, and she handed one to each of them. The men held them awkwardly, their expressions a mixture of boyish excitement and a dawning awareness that the objects were heavier and more unwieldy than they had imagined.

Alistair stepped into the centre of the lawn, which now felt impossibly crowded. His carefully prepared opening remarks evaporated in a wave of stage fright. These weren’t anonymous faces in a crowd; they were his neighbours, his students. He was responsible for them. He took a breath, planted his feet, and the familiar stability of the *posta breve* rose to meet him. “Welcome,” he began, his voice finding its professorial footing. “Before you even think about swinging these, you need to understand something fundamental. A sword is not an arm. It is an extension of the ground. The art we study, the *arte dell’armizare*, begins not with the hands, but with the soles of your feet. Everything, every attack, every defence, is built upon a stable foundation. Without it, you are, as the master wrote, ‘a house without a foundation; it will surely fall.’”

Chloe took over, her voice crisp and clear as she demonstrated the first stance. The four men attempted to mirror her. Mark, the plumber, bent his knees as if preparing to lift a boiler, his powerful frame locked into a rigid crouch. David, the accountant, barely bent his at all, wobbling precariously like a fledgling bird. Robert and his son Leo were somewhere in between, a study in earnest, clumsy effort. Alistair watched, a faint smile touching his lips. It was a perfect, almost comical recreation of his own first agonising attempts. He felt no sense of superiority, only a deep, resonant empathy. He saw his own stiffness in David, his own over-compensation in Mark. He remembered the burning in his thighs, the feeling of his body as a foreign country with a language he didn't speak.

Chloe moved among them, a patient but exacting instructor, correcting a shoulder here, an angle of a foot there. Alistair found himself adding context. “You feel that ache in your thighs, David? That’s good. That’s your foundation being built.” “Mark, relax your shoulders. The power isn’t up there, it’s in your connection to the ground.” He was translating not just the Italian text, but the physical text of their bodies, helping them read their own aches and imbalances. And then his eyes settled on Leo. The boy was struggling more than anyone. His long limbs seemed to have a mind of their own, and his waster wavered unsteadily. He was blushing, clearly frustrated. But he was not giving up. His brow was furrowed in a mask of intense concentration, his gaze fixed on his own feet as he tried to will them into the correct position. He adjusted, wobbled, and adjusted again, completely absorbed in solving the physical puzzle. In the boy’s fierce, self-conscious focus, Alistair saw a perfect, startling reflection of himself. He saw the quiet determination to master an alien grammar, the private war against one's own clumsiness.

The hour-long lesson ended with four sweating, groaning, but undeniably energised men. They were all smiling. “My quads are on fire,” Mark laughed, stretching theatrically. “Harder than laying pipe.” David was wiping his glasses, a look of dazed discovery on his face. “I think I found a muscle I haven’t used since 1998,” he said. But it was Robert who clapped Alistair on the shoulder, his grip firm. “That was brilliant, Professor. Absolutely brilliant.” He glanced at his son, who was still practicing the passing step, his earlier awkwardness already giving way to a more considered movement. “He hasn’t concentrated that hard on anything that wasn’t digital in years.” As they filed out through the gate, their thanks echoing in the quiet air, Alistair was left standing on his lawn. It was no longer a perfect circle of green. It was scuffed and trampled, a testament to the morning’s work. Meredith was on the patio, a tray loaded with glasses of water in her hands, her smile as bright as the morning sun. The first mistake, he reflected, had been the silence. But it was a mistake that had led him here, to this new, vibrant, and infinitely more interesting noise. He had not lost his sanctuary; he had simply discovered it was much, much bigger than he thought.### Chapter 6

The Saturdays took on a life of their own, establishing a rhythm that resonated through the rest of the week. Meredith, with her talent for affectionate labelling, had dubbed the enterprise ‘The Sir Walter Fencing School’, a name that stuck. The quiet suburban morning was now punctuated by a predictable series of sounds: the clack of wooden wasters, the grunts of exertion from men unused to such specific labour, the sharp, clear tone of Chloe’s corrections, and overlaid on it all, Alistair’s calm, professorial voice weaving historical context around the raw physical effort. His perfectly circular lawn was now permanently scuffed into a landscape of overlapping lines and footprints, a palimpsest of repeated drills and corrected stances. He no longer saw it as damage, but as data, the visible evidence of learning.

Their teaching styles dovetailed with a natural, unforced synergy. Chloe was the architect of the body. She moved with a quiet authority, physically adjusting a student's grip, tapping a hip to remind them to turn, her feedback concise and brutally efficient. “David, you’re holding it like a cricket bat. It’s not about bludgeoning; it’s about aiming the point.” Alistair, in contrast, was the translator of the soul of the art. While Chloe corrected the *how*, he illuminated the *why*. “The reason your elbow must remain connected to your body in that guard, Mark, is not arbitrary. Fiore calls it the ‘key’. It links the structure of your arm to the power of your entire body. Without that connection, you are merely pushing with your arm. With it, you are pushing with the ground itself.” He was giving them not just instructions, but a philosophy, a framework for understanding that transformed the clumsy, painful exercises into a coherent and elegant system.

The students, for their part, were a case study in contrasts. Mark, the plumber, strong and naturally coordinated, initially tried to muscle his way through every drill, his power compensating for his lack of technique. David, the accountant, was his opposite, timid and analytical, his movements small and hesitant, as if he were afraid of making a costly error on a ledger. Robert Marshall was the eager everyman, soaking up the history and context with as much enthusiasm as the physical instruction. But it was his son, Leo, who became the quiet focus of Alistair’s attention. The boy was trapped in the graceless hinterland of a teenage growth spurt, all long limbs and awkward angles. He possessed none of Mark’s raw strength nor his father’s easy enthusiasm. He was quiet, easily frustrated, and perpetually blushing. Alistair saw in him a painful echo of his own initial, humiliating flailing. He watched Leo struggle to coordinate a simple passing step with a rising block, his waster seeming to have a belligerent will of its own, and felt a pang of profound recognition.

The breaking point came on their fourth Saturday. They were practicing a simple combination: a descending cut followed by a swift recovery into a stable guard. Mark, as usual, performed the drill with a booming power that made the air whistle. Leo, attempting to follow, caught his feet, stumbled, and sent his waster cartwheeling pathetically onto the grass. A flush of deep, crimson shame crept up his neck. He stood motionless for a second before his shoulders slumped in utter defeat. “I can’t do this,” he mumbled, his voice thick with frustration. “It’s useless. I just suck at this.” He made a move to retrieve his waster, his body language screaming his intention to quit, to retreat from this new failure back into the predictable successes of his digital worlds.

“Leo, wait.” Alistair’s voice was quiet but it cut through the boy’s self-pity. The other men fell silent, sensing the shift in tone. Alistair walked over to the teenager, who refused to meet his eye. Chloe wisely held back, recognizing that this was a moment for a different kind of instruction. “You think you suck at this because you are not as strong as Mark,” Alistair stated, not as a question, but as a diagnosis. Leo gave a minute, sullen nod. “You are correct. You are not as strong as Mark. And if this were an art of strength, you would be right to quit. But it is not. It is an art of geometry and timing. It was designed by a man of my age to defeat younger, stronger, more aggressive opponents. It is, fundamentally, an art for the clever, not the mighty.”

He picked up Leo’s waster and held it out. “Your arms are long. You see that as awkward. Fiore would see it as an advantage in distance. You are not as muscular. Fiore would say that forces you to rely on structure and leverage, which are more reliable than muscle. You are making the same mistake I made for fifty-three years,” Alistair continued, his voice dropping slightly, becoming more personal. “You are looking at what you are not, instead of what you are. This art doesn't care if you can lift a heavy weight. It cares if you can see an angle, if you can understand a principle, if you can solve the problem of another person’s sword with your mind first, and your body second.” He gently placed the waster back in Leo’s hands. “Now. Forget about Mark. Forget about strength. I want you to perform the drill again, as slowly as you can. And I want you to think of nothing but the straight line from your back foot to the point of your blade. It is a geometry problem. Solve it.” Leo looked at him, his sullen frustration replaced by a flicker of bewildered curiosity. He took a breath, set his feet, and began the movement again, his brow furrowed not in anger, but in thought. The motion was still clumsy, but for the first time, it was deliberate. It was the beginning of an answer.A hush fell over the other students. Mark lowered his waster, his usual boisterous energy subdued, watching the scene with a new, thoughtful expression. David, who had been struggling with his own insecurities, seemed to stand a little straighter, as if Alistair’s words had also given him a shield. Robert Marshall watched his son with a painful, parental hope that was almost tangible. Leo, oblivious to their scrutiny, moved through the drill with the ponderous slowness of a tectonic plate. The cut was underpowered, the recovery was awkward, but his body was a single, connected line. His focus was absolute. He was not trying to hit something; he was trying to understand something. When he finally came to rest in the concluding guard, his waster was steady, his stance was balanced, and his face, though still flushed, was calm. He looked at Alistair and gave a short, jerky nod. It was an acknowledgment, a concession, and a thank you, all wrapped in one tiny, adolescent gesture.

The rest of the lesson proceeded in a more subdued, more focused atmosphere. The competitive energy had bled away, replaced by a collective sense of purpose. When they finished, and the men were wiping the sweat from their brows, the usual cheerful post-mortem was replaced by a quiet sense of accomplishment. As Robert and Leo were leaving, Robert paused at the gate, waiting for the others to pass. He turned back to Alistair, his voice low. “Thank you, Professor,” he said, his gaze direct and filled with a gratitude that went far beyond a paid lesson. “I’ve been trying to say something like that to him for a year. You just… found the words.” Alistair simply nodded, feeling a warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with physical exertion. He had not just taught a technique; he had offered a translation of a feeling, a bridge from one person’s quiet struggle to another's.

Later that afternoon, the house was filled with the comfortable, book-lined silence of a Sunday. Alistair sat in his study, not reading, but looking out the window at the scuffed, worn circle on his lawn. The space looked sacred now, a consecrated ground where small transformations took place. The feder leaned in its corner, a quiet sentinel. It no longer felt like an intruder or even a tool. It felt like a part of the room’s permanent architecture, as integral as the bookshelves laden with Carolingian reforms. Meredith came in, carrying two glasses of wine, and sat in the worn armchair he had long ago pushed aside to make room for his footwork drills. She followed his gaze out the window. "You were good with that boy today," she said. "Robert called me this afternoon to say thank you again. He said it was the first time he's seen Leo excited about anything offline in years."

"I just told him what I learned," Alistair said, turning away from the window to look at his wife. "That the art isn't about being strong enough. It's about being smart enough to not have to be." He took the glass she offered, the cool crystal a pleasant weight in his hand. “He reminded me of me. Defeated by a perceived weakness. My enemy wasn't a stubborn jar lid; it was his own adolescent awkwardness.”

Meredith smiled, a slow, gentle curve of her lips. “The man I married could deconstruct a sentence in five languages but was terrified of a wobbly stepladder. The man sitting in front of me today taught four grown men and a teenage boy how to find their centre. You didn’t just learn a new hobby, Aly. You learned a new language, and now you’re translating it for others.” Her gaze was clear and full of a love that was both comfortable in its familiarity and sparkling with a new kind of respect.

Alistair looked around the room, at the gilded spines of his books, the neat stacks of research papers, the gleaming steel of the feder. They were no longer separate worlds. The intellectual and the physical, the scholar and the swordsman, the man who read the texts and the man who embodied them—they had all converged in this quiet room, on this quiet afternoon. He had spent his life in the careful, solitary accumulation of knowledge, and his first mistake, he had thought, was the silence of his own inadequacy. But he saw now that it wasn't a mistake. It was a starting point. It was the question that had forced him out of his study and onto the lawn, into a journey that had led him, impossibly, right back to himself, but to a self made larger, stronger, and more whole. The silence had not been an absence to be filled with noise, but a space to be filled with growth. And standing here now, in the peaceful quiet of his own life, surrounded by his books, his sword, and his wife, Alistair Finch finally felt like he knew the answer.The Saturdays took on a life of their own, establishing a rhythm that resonated through the rest of the week. Meredith, with her talent for affectionate labelling, had dubbed the enterprise ‘The Sir Walter Fencing School’, a name that stuck. The quiet suburban morning was now punctuated by a predictable series of sounds: the clack of wooden wasters, the grunts of exertion from men unused to such specific labour, the sharp, clear tone of Chloe’s corrections, and overlaid on it all, Alistair’s calm, professorial voice weaving historical context around the raw physical effort.

It was the beginning of an answer.### Chapter 7

The seasons turned with the slow, inexorable grace of a well-executed guard. The fierce, bleaching sun of summer gave way to the golden, slanted light of a Toowoomba autumn. The Sir Walter buffalo grass, weary from its weekly trampling, had surrendered its lush green for a more dignified, straw-coloured hue in the worn circle at its centre. The school, as Meredith now unironically called it, had not only persisted; it had grown. Two more students had joined their ranks—a quiet but determined woman who was a nurse at the local hospital, and a retired history teacher who treated Alistair’s lectures on Fiore with the reverence of a religious sermon. The backyard on a Saturday morning was a scene of controlled, purposeful chaos.

Alistair stood on the patio, a mug of steaming coffee warming his hands, and surveyed his domain. He had ceded the primary physical instruction of the beginners to Chloe, freeing him to act as an overseer, a roving consultant who diagnosed faults in form and philosophy. He watched as Mark, the plumber, guided one of the newcomers through a basic parry. The explosive power was still there, but it was now leashed, controlled. He was no longer trying to shatter the incoming blade, but to guide it, his movements imbued with a surprising finesse. Across the lawn, David, the accountant, moved through a solo drill with a quiet, focused intensity, his posture no longer hesitant but rooted, his gaze fixed on an imaginary opponent. The transformation was remarkable. He had found a place where the meticulous, risk-averse nature that made him a good accountant could be channelled into a physical discipline, and it had given him an unexpected and profound confidence.

His gaze, however, was inevitably drawn to Leo. The boy was a different person from the sullen, frustrated teenager who had nearly quit months ago. The gangly awkwardness had not vanished, but it had been reorganised, brought into a system. He was sparring with his father, their wooden wasters moving at a slow, deliberate pace. Robert, ever the enthusiast, attacked with a wide, telegraphed cut. Leo didn’t meet it with force. Instead, he took a small, precise passing step offline, letting his father’s momentum carry the blow past him. As the opening appeared, Leo’s blade flowed into the empty space, its tip coming to rest lightly on Robert’s ribs. It was a perfect execution of the second remedy of the First Master of the Sword, a sequence they had only briefly covered. More than that, it was done with an instinctual understanding of timing and distance that couldn’t be taught, only discovered. The boy hadn’t just learned the moves; he was beginning to think in the language of the art. He was solving the geometry problem.

Later, as the students packed away their gear, their chatter filling the air, Leo approached Alistair, a well-worn notebook in his hand. “Professor,” he said, his voice no longer a mumble but quiet and clear. “I was looking at the Getty manuscript online, like you suggested. In the section on the Seventh Master, Fiore writes about a parry that ‘breaks the thrust and enters with the point’. I think it’s the same principle as the second remedy, but applied from a different guard. Is that right?” He opened the notebook to a page filled with surprisingly neat hand-drawn stick figures, replicating the manuscript’s diagrams, with arrows and notes scribbled in the margins. Alistair looked at the page, a feeling of immense, dizzying pride swelling in his chest. This was not a student asking for an answer. This was a fellow scholar proposing a theory. He had passed on not just the art, but the obsession, the insatiable curiosity, the quiet, thrilling hum of discovery.

This new, vibrant ecosystem was, however, beginning to strain the confines of its terrarium. The lawn was crowded, and when they practiced drills that required more space, students had to take turns, waiting on the patio. The intimacy of the small group was giving way to the logistical challenges of a proper class. It was a problem Alistair was quietly dreading, a complication to his new, comfortable reality. The complication arrived not as a complaint, but in a crisp blue polo shirt. One Saturday, after the lesson, as Meredith was handing out her signature lemonade, a woman Alistair recognised from the local council offices walked through the side-gate, which Robert had left open. She had an air of brisk, cheerful efficiency. “Professor Finch?” she asked, her eyes taking in the scene—the collection of sweating but happy people, the stack of wooden swords, the worn-out lawn. “My name is Brenda Jeffries, from the Community Development office. I’ve been hearing some very interesting things about your… group.”

Alistair felt a familiar clench of anxiety. The intrusion of officialdom, of bureaucracy, felt like a threat to the fragile, organic community he had accidentally cultivated. He managed a polite, non-committal nod. “We’re just a private study group,” he said, the old defensive shield rising automatically. Brenda smiled, a knowing, practiced smile that had likely disarmed hundreds of wary citizens. “That’s what I heard. I also heard you’ve got a waiting list, and that you’re doing more for teenage engagement and adult fitness than half of my officially funded programs.” She gestured around the crowded garden. “My reason for intruding is simple. You’re outgrowing your space. The old North Toowoomba Bowls Club was decommissioned last year. It has a clubhouse, a fenced-in green, and full insurance coverage under the council’s community recreation umbrella. We’re looking for local groups to make use of it. We could offer you the space, two evenings a week and Saturday mornings, for a nominal fee.”

The offer hung in the air, shimmering with terrifying potential. It was everything he should have wanted: legitimacy, room to expand, insurance, a proper home for their school. It was validation on a level he had never imagined. But it was also a final, irrevocable step out of the sanctuary of his own backyard. It meant schedules and membership forms and public liability. It meant transforming his personal rebellion into a public institution. He looked at Chloe, whose eyes were wide with the possibilities. He looked at Meredith, who was watching him with an expression of pure, unadulterated triumph, as if this had been her plan all along. He looked back at the worn circle of grass, the place where he had first felt the humiliating weight of the sword, the place where he had found his balance, the place where he had taught a boy to believe in the geometry of his own strength. It was the cradle of his new life. Now, he was being asked to leave it.Alistair stood rooted to the spot, a statue in the centre of his own chaotic tableau. Brenda Jeffries’s words, so reasonable and so devastating, seemed to suck the very air from the garden. On one side of him stood the past: a scuffed patch of lawn that had served as the crucible for his own private alchemy, transforming shame into confidence. On the other side stood a terrifyingly official future: a world of membership forms, public liability, and opening hours. He could feel the expectant gazes of his students, the silent, unwavering support of his wife, and the keen, analytical curiosity of Chloe. It was the demonstration at the fair all over again, but this time the stage was his entire life, and the performance had no script. His professorial instincts, his lifelong training in deflection and deliberation, took over.

“That is an extraordinary proposition, Brenda,” he said, his voice emerging with a composure that felt utterly fraudulent. “A very generous offer. We would, of course, need some time to discuss it. As you say, we are a private group, and this would represent a significant change in our… structure.” He had bought himself time, wrapping his fear in the respectable packaging of due diligence. Brenda, recognising the tactic, gave another of her warm, efficient smiles. “Of course, Professor. Take all the time you need. Here’s my card. Just let me know when you’ve had a chance to talk it over.” She passed him the small, stiff rectangle of cardboard, a tangible token of the crossroads at which he now stood, and then, with a cheerful wave to the group, she departed, leaving a profound and unnerving silence in her wake.

The buzz that followed her departure was immediate and electric. The students, who had been respectfully quiet, now erupted in a babble of excitement. Mark was already envisioning a space where he could perform a full-power cut without fear of decapitating Meredith’s prize-winning roses. David was nervously asking about fees and schedules, his mind already creating spreadsheets. Robert was beaming, seeing a legitimate future for the hobby that had so captivated his son. They were no longer just Alistair’s private pupils; they were a charter committee, the founding members of an institution that did not yet exist. Alistair felt a dizzying sense of vertigo. This thing he had started as a solitary act of rebellion had grown a life of its own, and its momentum was now threatening to pull him far out into waters he had never intended to navigate. He felt the project, his project, being gently but inexorably lifted from his hands by the collective enthusiasm of the community he had unwittingly created.

That evening, the quiet of the study felt different. It was not a sanctuary but a holding cell, a place of anxious indecision. Meredith found him there, staring out the window at the empty lawn, the ghosts of the morning’s class still moving in the twilight. She didn’t speak, simply handed him a glass of whisky and settled into the worn armchair, her presence a quiet invitation to talk. “I can’t do it, Mez,” he finally said, turning from the window. The words were a confession. “I can’t be the head of a… a club. I’m a scholar. I’m a teacher in a classroom, not a community organiser. All of this, the bureaucracy, the responsibility for other people’s safety on a larger scale, the public profile… I’m not built for it. We’ll lose what makes it special. The magic was in the backyard. It was small, it was ours.”

Meredith took a slow sip of her wine, her gaze steady. She didn’t argue with his logic. She didn’t list the benefits or downplay his fears. Instead, she reframed his entire premise. “The magic was never in the grass, Aly,” she said, her voice soft but clear. “The magic was watching David, who is scared of his own shadow, learn to stand his ground. It was in Mark learning that control is more important than power. The magic is in Leo’s notebook, the one he now carries everywhere instead of his phone. You didn’t build a school in the backyard. You just discovered you had one inside you all along. This garden wasn’t the destination; it was just the first classroom.” She leaned forward, her expression earnest and full of a fierce belief that still took his breath away. “You’re scared. Of course you are. You were scared of the feder, and you were scared of the fair. Every time you’ve stepped out of this room, you’ve been scared. But look what you’ve built every time you’ve done it. You’re not a community organiser. You’re a teacher. And your classroom just got bigger.”

Her words landed not as a challenge, but as a diagnosis, a perfect and illuminating articulation of the truth. His fear was real, but it was also familiar, a ghost that had haunted every step of his progress. To listen to it now would be the greatest retreat of all. The next morning, he sat at his desk, Brenda Jeffries’s card resting beside his telephone. He picked up the receiver, his heart pounding a familiar, frantic rhythm. He dialled the number, took a breath that started deep in his gut, and when she answered, his voice was clear and steady. “Brenda, it’s Alistair Finch,” he said. “We’d be delighted to accept the council’s offer. When can we see the space?”

Three days later, Alistair, Meredith, and Chloe stood before the old North Toowoomba Bowls Club. It was a modest, cream-brick building, slightly neglected, with a few weeds poking through the cracks in the entryway. Inside, the clubhouse smelled faintly of stale beer, dust, and the ghosts of a thousand weekly raffles. Faded rectangles on the wood-panelled walls marked where honour boards and photographs had once hung. It was a place of echoes, steeped in a history of quiet, communal leisure. Then, Chloe pushed open the glass doors at the back, and they stepped out onto the green. It was vast. The manicured lawn stretched out before them, a perfect, impossibly large expanse of green bordered by empty spectator benches and a high chain-link fence. It was silent, empty, and intimidating in its sheer potential. It was a new, yawning quiet, grander and more public than any he had faced before, waiting to be filled. Alistair looked at Chloe, whose face was alight with the thrill of a blank canvas, and then at Meredith, who simply slipped her hand into his, her grip firm and sure. He was no longer just filling a silence in his own life. They were here to build something new, together, in the quiet heart of their city.### Chapter 8

The first Saturday at the North Toowoomba Bowls Club felt like the first day of a new school year. An air of nervous excitement and starched formality hung over the group as they gathered in the gravel car park. The students, now numbering eight, carried their wasters with a self-consciousness they hadn’t possessed in the familiar intimacy of Alistair’s backyard. The cream-brick clubhouse, with its official-looking noticeboard and glass doors, transformed them from a group of eccentrics engaged in a shared hobby into a proper club, with all the unspoken expectations that entailed. Alistair felt a fresh wave of imposter syndrome wash over him. He was no longer Professor Finch indulging a whim in his garden; he was the de facto headmaster of an institution, standing before a building that seemed to demand a competence he felt he was only just beginning to borrow.

Chloe, ever practical, led them through the dusty clubhouse and out onto the green. The collective intake of breath was audible. The sheer, unadulterated space of it was stunning. After months of calibrating their movements to the confines of a suburban lawn, the vast, flat expanse of the bowling green felt like stepping onto an alien planet. It was a liberating, and slightly terrifying, emptiness. Alistair watched his students spread out, a hesitant diaspora on the manicured grass. They looked small and suddenly very amateurish against the backdrop of the professional-grade turf and the empty spectator benches. The comfortable proximity that had allowed for quiet, personal corrections was gone. Here, every flaw, every misstep, would be visible from fifty paces.

The lesson that followed was a revelation in scale. For the first time, they could practice the long, lunging attacks from the Getty manuscript without fear of running into a fence or a prize-winning azalea. They ran drills in two lines, the whole group moving in synchrony, the rhythmic scuff of their feet and the clack of wood on wood creating a percussive symphony that filled the quiet morning air. The space was a demanding teacher. It revealed faults that the smaller yard had concealed: a lack of cardiovascular fitness during extended plays, an inconsistency in form when crossing long distances. But it also offered a profound reward. As Alistair watched his students perform a passing-step drill from one end of the green to the other, their line advancing like a hesitant but determined medieval company, he felt a thrill that was entirely new. This was no longer just a reconstruction of a text; it was a resurrection of a practice, brought to life on a scale he had never dared to imagine.

After the session, exhausted and exhilarated, they trooped back into the clubhouse. In the backyard, this was when everyone would disperse. But here, in this shared, neutral territory, a different dynamic emerged. Meredith had worked her quiet magic, setting up an old trestle table with an electric urn, a selection of teas, and a mountain of biscuits she’d baked the night before. The students didn’t leave. They lingered, sipping from mismatched mugs, their bodies tired but their minds buzzing. They were no longer guests in someone’s home; they were members in their own clubhouse. The conversation naturally turned to the space itself. Mark, wiping his hands on his trousers, peered into the small kitchenette. “Tap in here’s got a steady drip,” he announced. “And the hot water system looks like it’s from the Bronze Age. I could take a look at it next week, bring a few tools.” David, a mug cradled in his hands, was already sketching on a napkin. “If we had twelve regular members paying a small monthly fee,” he mused, “we could easily cover the council’s charge and have a surplus for new equipment within six months.”

Alistair watched it all unfold, feeling at first like an outsider at his own party. They were talking about plumbing and budgets, the very bureaucratic minutiae that had filled him with dread. He had feared being burdened by these responsibilities, but he had been wrong. The community, the one he had so accidentally fostered, was distributing the burden amongst themselves. They were not just students, expecting a service. They were stakeholders, investing their own skills and time. Robert Marshall was wiping down the dusty window sills. The retired history teacher was examining the empty honour boards with a thoughtful expression. Even Leo, tasked by his father with collecting the mugs, was doing so with a quiet efficiency, a sense of belonging writ large in his posture. Alistair realised, with a jolt, that he hadn’t created a school that he now had to manage. He had simply lit a fire, and the others were now instinctively gathering wood to keep it burning.

“So,” Chloe said, breaking into his thoughts as she handed him a cup of tea. “The Sir Walter Fencing School doesn’t quite fit the new digs. What do we call ourselves, officially?” The question quieted the room. The members looked to Alistair, their leader. The old Alistair would have demurred, deflected. The new Alistair considered the question on its merits. They were a group dedicated to a specific text, a specific master. They were a blend of academic rigour and physical practice. They were of Toowoomba, this Garden City of quiet streets and surprising passions. “Fiore called his collective a *compagnia*,” Alistair said, thinking aloud. “A company. A fellowship.” Leo, emboldened, spoke up from beside the sink. “His book was the *Flower of Battle*,” he said, his voice hesitant but clear. “The flower part kind of fits with the Garden City, doesn’t it?” There was a murmur of agreement. The name clicked into place, a perfect synthesis of their history, their purpose, and their home. “The Toowoomba Flower of Battle,” Alistair said, testing the words. “Or, in the Italian, the *Fiore di Battaglia Toowoomba*.” A small, collective cheer went up.

An hour later, Alistair stood alone on the deserted green as the sun began to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple and soft orange. He held a single, unfamiliar key in his hand—the key to the clubhouse. The silence that surrounded him was vast, broken only by the distant cry of a currawong. It was the vast, yawning quiet of a Saturday afternoon, but it no longer had weight. It was not an absence, not a void demanding to be filled. It was a space of infinite potential. He looked from the darkening green to the darkened clubhouse, a building waiting to be filled with life, with learning, with the noisy, chaotic, wonderful business of community. He had not lost his quiet study. He had just realised that its walls were far wider than he had ever known, wide enough, it seemed, to encompass an entire city. He locked the gate, the sound of the bolt sliding home echoing in the twilight, a final, satisfying click of a new chapter falling into place.### Chapter 8

The North Toowoomba Bowls Club, reborn as the home of the *Fiore di Battaglia Toowoomba*, shed its skin of neglect with surprising speed. Autumn settled over the city, and the clubhouse transformed from a dusty relic into a vibrant hub. Mark the plumber, true to his word, had silenced the dripping tap and coaxed the ancient hot water system back to sputtering life. David the accountant had created a simple but elegant financial system, with monthly fees neatly recorded and a budget for new equipment pinned to a corkboard he had installed himself. The most striking change, however, was on the wood-panelled walls. Arthur, the retired history teacher, had taken on the role of club curator. Where faded rectangles had once marked the ghosts of bowling trophies, there now hung beautifully framed, high-resolution prints from the Getty manuscript, each accompanied by a small, meticulously researched plaque written by Alistair, explaining the context of the play. The clubhouse was no longer just a space; it was a museum, a library, and a training hall, a physical manifestation of their dual identity as scholars and practitioners.

Alistair’s life had bifurcated. His weekdays were still spent in the hallowed quiet of the university, wrestling with obscure verb forms and lecturing on Carolingian poetry. But his evenings and a significant portion of his mental energy were now dedicated to the club. He found himself sitting at his antique desk, a cup of Earl Grey at his elbow, composing not a paper on philology, but a carefully worded email to a fencing equipment supplier in Sydney, inquiring about bulk discounts on protective masks. He drafted a safety waiver with the meticulous attention to detail he normally reserved for a critical translation. It was a strange, often exasperating, administrative world, filled with the kind of practical details he had spent his entire adult life avoiding. Yet, he found a surprising, quiet satisfaction in it. Each solved problem, each answered email, was another brick laid in the foundation of the community they were building. He was no longer just a solitary scholar; he was the custodian of a shared passion.

The Saturday sessions hummed with a new and organised energy. The beginner’s class, now swollen to over a dozen students, occupied the near end of the green. Chloe ran it with a serene efficiency, but she was no longer alone. At her side, acting as an assistant instructor, was Leo. The boy who had nearly quit in a fit of frustration now moved with a quiet confidence, demonstrating the basic guards to newcomers, his long limbs no longer a source of awkwardness but an example of a specific physical reality to be understood and utilised. He would correct a beginner’s grip with a gentle, patient touch, echoing the same words Alistair had once used on him. “It’s a geometry problem,” Alistair overheard him say to a new student, a university undergraduate who had seen a flyer for the club. “You just have to solve it.” To witness that quiet moment of mentorship, the direct transmission of a philosophy from one struggling student to another, was, for Alistair, a reward more profound than any academic citation.

Alistair and an increasingly competent Mark now co-led the intermediate group at the far end of the green, working on the more complex, flowing plays from the heart of the manuscript. The space allowed them to practice with a realism that had been impossible in the garden. They learned the rhythms of advance and retreat, the importance of controlling the measure, the crucial distance between combatants. The art was no longer a series of static positions, but a living, breathing conversation of movement. After the formal lesson, the clubhouse would fill with the warm fug of sweat, tea, and companionship. The discussions were lively, ranging from the finer points of a specific parry to David’s proud announcement that they could now afford to purchase their first set of proper steel training swords. The club was thriving, a small, vibrant ecosystem of learning and camaraderie that felt both miraculous and perfectly natural.

The next stage of their evolution arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, not by email, but through the university’s internal mail system. It was a thick, cream-coloured envelope, addressed to ‘Professor Alistair Finch, Head Instructor, Fiore di Battaglia Toowoomba’. The formality of the address alone sent a small shiver of apprehension down his spine. Inside was a professionally printed invitation. The Gryphon Sword Guild of Brisbane, one of the oldest and most respected HEMA clubs in the state, was hosting its annual regional Fechtschule, a weekend-long event of workshops, friendly sparring, and scholarly presentations. The letter, penned by the guild’s president, was a formal invitation for the Toowoomba school to attend, and for Alistair to potentially present a short paper on his work translating Fiore. It was an invitation into the wider world, a formal recognition of their existence from the established order. It was also, to Alistair, a summons to a trial.

He sat in his study that evening, the invitation lying on his desk like an unexploded bomb. He imagined his students, his collection of plumbers, accountants, and history teachers, stepping into a hall filled with seasoned, competitively-focused fencers. He pictured their careful, academic style, born of quiet study and cooperative drilling, being dismantled by the aggressive, athletic efficiency of martial artists who trained not just to understand, but to win. The safe, supportive haven he had so carefully constructed felt fragile, a delicate terrarium about to be exposed to a harsh and unforgiving climate. He feared the humiliation, the inevitable discovery that their beautiful, philosophical art was no match for the hard realities of competitive sparring. The magic would be broken, the confidence shattered.

He was still staring at the invitation when Meredith came in. She read it over his shoulder, her expression unreadable. “A Fechtschule,” she said, testing the German word. “It sounds very grand.” “It’s a tournament, Mez,” he said, his voice flat. “They’ll tear us to pieces. We’re not fighters. We’re academics with sticks.” She didn’t respond immediately, instead walking to the bookshelf where his own feder still leaned. She ran a hand down the smooth, cold steel. “A few months ago, you told me you were a linguist who didn’t swashbuckle. At the fair, you said you weren’t a historical re-enactor. Every time you’ve defined what you are not, you’ve ended up becoming something more. What are you so afraid of this time? That you’re not good enough?”

“I’m afraid for them,” he countered, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the town. “I’m afraid of taking this wonderful, positive thing we’ve built and exposing it to failure. I’m afraid they’ll get hurt, or discouraged, and all of this will just… end.” “Or,” she said, turning back to him, her eyes holding his with a familiar, unwavering clarity, “they might learn something new. They might discover they’re better than they think. They might even have fun. You built a school to teach Fiore’s art, Alistair. According to you, it was an art for fighting. At some point, don’t you have to see if it actually works?” The next Saturday, after the lesson, Alistair pinned the thick, cream-coloured invitation to the centre of the clubhouse noticeboard. He didn't announce it, he just placed it there, a quiet challenge and an open question. He then stood back and waited for his students to discover it for themselves.The effect was not immediate. The students, flushed and energized from the session, streamed into the clubhouse, their minds on recovery and conversation, not on administrative notices. They gravitated towards the urn Meredith had set up, the familiar ritual of making tea and grabbing a biscuit taking precedence. It was David, the accountant, who saw it first. He had gone to the noticeboard to check the attendance sheet he’d posted, and his eyes snagged on the thick, cream-coloured cardstock pinned directly in the centre. He froze mid-reach, his spectacles slipping down his nose. He read it once, then again, his eyebrows climbing steadily towards his hairline. He let out a low whistle, a sound of pure astonishment that was entirely out of character. “Mark,” he called out, his voice a half-whisper. “You’d better come and see this.”

Mark ambled over, followed by Robert and a few others, and soon a dense cluster of people were gathered around the noticeboard, their voices a low, awed murmur that slowly spread through the room. The Gryphon Sword Guild. Fechtschule. The names themselves carried a weight, a legitimacy that made their own humble club feel suddenly very small. The murmur grew as the full implications of the invitation sank in. For the past months, they had existed in a safe, self-contained world. This invitation was a door to a much larger, more intimidating universe, one populated by people who didn’t just practice the art, but competed in it. Mark’s reaction was immediate and predictable. A broad grin split his face. “Well, look at that,” he boomed. “The big leagues. It’s about time we went and showed them what Toowoomba’s got!” Across the huddle, David was already looking pale, the financial and logistical hurdles rising like a mountain range in his mind. “Brisbane… that’s travel, accommodation… and their skill level will be… significantly higher. The insurance implications alone…” Arthur, the retired teacher, was peering at the fine print, his historian’s curiosity piqued. “They have a scholarly track,” he noted with interest. “It’s not just a tournament. It’s a symposium.”

The group fragmented into camps of gung-ho enthusiasm, practical anxiety, and academic curiosity. Finally, as if by a silent, collective agreement, all eyes turned to Alistair, who had been quietly observing the unfolding drama from beside the tea station. He stepped forward, and a hush fell over the room. He had rehearsed this moment in his mind, steeling himself against their inevitable disappointment when he counselled caution. He looked at their expectant faces, a gallery of hope and fear, and chose the truth. “It is a great honour to be invited,” he began, his voice calm and even. “It is a sign that what we are doing here is being noticed. It is also a significant challenge.” He didn’t hide his own reservations. “The focus of many clubs who attend these events is competitive. Their training is geared towards winning bouts under a specific ruleset. Our focus, as you know, has always been the interpretive study of Fiore’s text. We are a young school. I have no desire to throw any of you into a situation that could lead to injury, or to see the confidence we have all worked so hard to build be shaken by a few bad encounters.” He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. “There is no shame whatsoever in deciding we are not ready. Our work here continues regardless. This is a decision we must make as a club, and I will support it, whatever it may be.”

A thoughtful silence descended. The initial excitement had been tempered by Alistair’s sober assessment. The responsible, prudent course of action seemed to be to politely decline, to continue their work in the safety of their own green until they were more prepared. Mark looked uncharacteristically subdued. David seemed visibly relieved. Just as the momentum was swinging towards a collective, sensible retreat, a quiet voice cut through the quiet. “But aren’t we a school?” It was Leo. He stood by the wall of manuscript prints, his notebook clutched in one hand. He wasn’t looking at Alistair, but at the diagrams on the wall. “All this time, you’ve been teaching us the grammar of the art, Professor. You said we have to learn the language to understand the text. We’ve been learning it here, just with each other. It’s like we’ve been learning Italian in a classroom in Australia. Going there… it’s like taking a trip to Florence. We’ll hear other accents. We’ll encounter slang we don’t understand. We might get confused, or make mistakes.” He finally lifted his head and looked at the group, his gaze earnest and clear. “We’re not going there to win. We’re not even going there to fight. We’re going there to listen. To see what our art sounds like when it’s spoken by others. It’s a field trip, for our research.”

The simple, powerful analogy shifted the entire gravity of the room. It was Alistair’s own philosophy, his own methodology, reflected back at him through the clear eyes of his youngest student. Before anyone could respond, Chloe stepped forward, a supportive smile on her face. “Leo’s exactly right,” she said, her practical tone a grounding force. “I’ve been to these events. It’s not a gladiatorial pit. Yes, there’s a tournament, and it’s serious. But there are also workshops taught by some of the best instructors in the country. There’s friendly, informal sparring—‘freeplay’—where you can ask to go light, to work on specific techniques. You tell someone, ‘Hey, I’m still new, can we just work on entries from long guard?’ and ninety-nine percent of the time, they’ll say yes. It’s a festival of learning. The tournament is just one part of it.” She looked around the room. “We don’t have to enter the tournament. We can go, take the classes, participate in the freeplay, and talk to people. We can be a scholarly delegation.”

The twin arguments, Leo’s philosophical frame and Chloe’s practical reassurance, were an irrefutable combination. The anxiety in the room didn’t vanish, but it was transmuted into a nervous, purposeful resolve. Mark’s grin returned, but it was more thoughtful this time. David pulled out his napkin and began sketching a new, more ambitious budget. They took an informal show of hands, and the decision was swift, passionate, and unanimous. They would go. Alistair stood, watching the wave of collective courage wash over his students. They were not afraid. Or rather, they were afraid, but they had chosen to be brave together. He had been so worried about protecting them from failure that he had almost denied them the opportunity for growth. He felt a surge of pride so fierce it almost brought tears to his eyes. He looked at the thick, cream-coloured invitation still pinned to the board. It was no longer a summons or a threat. It was a new page, waiting to be written. “In that case,” he said, his voice catching slightly before finding its familiar, steady tone, “I believe I have a short paper on the scholastic structure and mnemonic devices within the Getty manuscript that might be of some interest to their scholarly track. I’ll draft a proposal this evening.”### Chapter 10

The weeks leading up to the Fechtschule were a crucible. The easy, almost leisurely atmosphere of the Saturday sessions vanished, replaced by a thrumming, purposeful intensity. The deadline, once an abstract concept, was now a date circled in red on the clubhouse noticeboard, a ticking clock that lent a new, sharp-edged gravity to their training. The gentle clack of wood on wood was now a more urgent, percussive rhythm, and the breaks for water were shorter, the conversations less about the week’s events and more about the mechanics of a specific guard or the timing of a parry. Alistair felt the shift in his own role most acutely. He was no longer just a teacher imparting historical knowledge; he was a coach preparing a team for a contest, a role for which he felt profoundly unqualified. His concerns were no longer purely technical, but psychological. He watched his students, seeing not just their footwork but the state of their confidence, a resource he now understood to be as vital as muscle, and far more brittle.

His study, once a tranquil haven, became a command centre for a two-front war. On one side of his desk lay the open facsimile of the Getty manuscript, surrounded by academic journals and his own spidery, ink-stained notes for the paper he was to present. He wrestled with the nuances of Fiore’s scholastic rhetoric, crafting arguments about the master’s use of classical memory systems to structure his martial pedagogy. On the other side of the desk, a newly purchased whiteboard was covered in a chaotic scrawl of drills, conditioning exercises, and strategic notes. He would spend an hour deconstructing a Latin phrase, then get up and pace the worn floorboards of his study, working through a defensive sequence he needed to teach, muttering to himself about angles and leverage. He was a scholar of two interconnected disciplines, the textual and the kinetic, and the impending Fechtschule was a peer review for both.

The arrival of their first sets of proper protective gear marked a significant and sobering escalation. A series of large, anonymous cardboard boxes arrived at the clubhouse, and David, with a treasurer’s pride, sliced them open to reveal the stark, modern implements of their chosen art. There were padded gambesons, bulky and smelling faintly of canvas and dye; thick, articulated gloves that looked like something from a science fiction film; and most intimidating of all, the fencing masks. The moment Mark put one on, his cheerful, familiar face was replaced by the impersonal black mesh of the visor, transforming him from a friendly plumber into a faceless, menacing opponent. When the others followed suit, the friendly atmosphere of the club was instantly altered. The sounds became muffled, the vision narrowed to a tunnel, and the simple act of looking at one’s training partner became an act of peering at an anonymous threat. This, Alistair realised, was a crucial part of the training: the psychological conditioning required to face not a person, but a masked combatant.

The first time they engaged in light sparring with the full kit was a humbling disaster. Alistair gathered them in the centre of the green, their bulky forms moving with a new and clumsy stiffness. He laid out the rules with painstaking care: light contact only, no head thrusts, the goal was not to win but to gather data, to feel the pressure of an uncooperative opponent for the first time. The moment he called “Fence!”, the elegant, geometric drills they had practiced for months evaporated in a frantic clattering of wood and a flurry of awkward, panicked movements. Their carefully learned principles were forgotten in the adrenalized rush of the exchange. They over-committed, they flailed, they abandoned their footwork and relied on instinct, which, for all of them, was universally wrong. After ninety seconds of this chaotic mess, Alistair blew the whistle he now carried, his voice sharp. “Stop!”

He walked among them as they stood panting, their masks amplifying the sound of their ragged breaths. He could feel the waves of frustration and disappointment rolling off them. “You see?” he said, his voice calm but firm. “The moment you faced resistance, you abandoned your principles. You stopped thinking. You reverted to a brawl. Mark, you tried to power through a defence that was structurally sound. David, you retreated in a straight line, offering your opponent the same measure. Robert, you looked at the sword, not the body. These are the exact mistakes Fiore warns us against. The pressure is the test. It is designed to make you fail so you can learn *why* you failed.” He then walked over to Leo, who looked particularly disheartened. “Leo, you will spar with me. Everyone else, watch.”

He and Leo faced each other. Alistair attacked, not with speed or power, but with simple, relentless pressure, forcing Leo onto the defensive. The boy fell back, his movements becoming increasingly frantic. Then, Alistair saw a flicker of recognition in his eyes. Instead of trying to meet the next cut with force, Leo executed a small, almost imperceptible side-step, the *scansare*, while performing a simple deflection. Alistair’s waster slid harmlessly past him, and for a single, perfect moment, Alistair’s entire right side was open. Leo’s counter was not fast or powerful, but it was precise, his waster tapping Alistair lightly on the ribs. It was a perfect, practical application of theory under pressure. Alistair stepped back and raised a hand. “There,” he said, his voice ringing across the silent green. “There it is. He did not beat my strength. He solved the problem. That is what we are here to learn.” The lesson landed with the force of a physical blow. The rest of the session was different. The students were still clumsy, they still made mistakes, but they were thinking again. They were trying to solve the problem.That singular, successful exchange echoed through the rest of the preparatory sessions, becoming a touchstone for the entire group. It was a tangible demonstration of their core philosophy, a piece of evidence they could cling to when their confidence wavered. The frantic, brawling energy of that first sparring session was replaced by a more thoughtful, inquisitive approach. Alistair and Chloe structured the subsequent practices around “sparring with intent.” Each bout had a specific objective: one person would be tasked with only defending, another with only attacking the legs, another with only attempting to gain control of the opponent’s hilt. Failure was reframed as a successful data-gathering exercise. Their collective skill did not skyrocket, but their collective intelligence deepened immensely. They were learning not just how to fight, but how to learn from a fight.

In the quiet hours of the evening, after the physical exhaustion of the training sessions had subsided, Alistair would retreat to his study for his own scholarly battle. He was deep in the intellectual architecture of his paper, trying to articulate the subtle ways Fiore used language to convey complex physical principles. He found himself wrestling with a passage he had always considered poetic flourish, where Fiore describes a particular defensive action as *il gioco che rompe la spada*—the play that breaks the sword. It was illogical; steel did not simply break. He had always annotated it as an example of medieval hyperbole. But one night, replaying the memory of Leo’s sparring session in his mind, it suddenly clicked into place with the force of a revelation. Leo hadn’t broken the waster. He had broken the attack. He had rendered the line of force so structurally unsound that the “sword”—the entire offensive commitment of his opponent—was shattered, leaving the attacker exposed and vulnerable. It wasn't about metallurgy; it was about tactical and structural collapse. The physical experience had unlocked the linguistic puzzle. He grabbed his pen, a current of intellectual excitement surging through him, and began to write, his words flying across the page, bridging the six-hundred-year gap between the master’s pen and the professor’s understanding.

The Friday of the Fechtschule arrived with a sky the colour of a steel blade. The car park of the North Toowoomba Bowls Club was a scene of controlled chaos. Gear bags, bulky and overstuffed, were being crammed into the boots of a motley convoy of sedans and family SUVs. Mark, his face alight with a kind of nervous glee, was directing the packing like a seasoned quartermaster. Meredith was there, a solid, calming presence, dispensing thermoses of coffee and individually wrapped sandwiches with the practiced ease of a mother sending her children off to their first school camp. She caught Alistair’s eye as he wrestled his own cumbersome gear bag into the back of his car and gave him a small, almost imperceptible nod. It was a gesture packed with meaning: *You’ve got this. Look at what you’ve built.*

He found himself standing beside Leo, who was staring at the line of cars, his own mask and gambeson clutched in his hands, his knuckles white. “Nervous?” Alistair asked quietly. Leo jumped, startled. “A bit,” he admitted, his voice barely a whisper. “Everyone there… they’ll be so much better.” Alistair leaned against the car, mirroring the boy’s posture. “They will be more experienced,” he corrected him gently. “They will likely be faster and stronger. But you have something many of them might not. You have the text. You know the *why* behind the *what*. Don’t go there to win bouts. Go there to ask questions. Every time someone scores on you, your only job is to understand how and why. Treat it like a research problem. You are a scholar of the sword, Leo, not just a fencer. Remember that.” Leo looked up at him, a flicker of his earlier confidence returning to his eyes, and he nodded, a firm, determined gesture this time.

With a final round of farewells to Meredith, the convoy pulled out of the car park. Alistair drove, with Chloe beside him navigating and Robert and Leo quiet in the back. As they descended the steep grade of the Toowoomba Range, the familiar patchwork of the Lockyer Valley spreading out below them, he glanced in his rearview mirror. Behind him, Mark’s ute and David’s sensible sedan followed in close formation. A small company of accountants, plumbers, teachers, and students, armed with wood and steel and a formidable weight of carefully studied theory, heading towards the glittering, indifferent sprawl of the city. They were leaving the safety of their garden, their clubhouse, their quiet city on the hill, and venturing into the wider world to see if their beautiful, fragile art was real. The first mistake had been the silence. Now, Alistair thought as he guided the car onto the motorway, the real test was how they would handle the noise.### Chapter 11

The journey down the mountain range was a descent into a different world. The crisp, high-altitude air of Toowoomba gave way to the thick, subtropical humidity of Brisbane, a heavy blanket that seemed to muffle thought and amplify unease. The city, when they reached it, was a jarring cacophony of traffic, construction, and anonymous, rushing crowds. The quiet, considered pace of their lives was replaced by a relentless, indifferent momentum. The venue for the Fechtschule was a vast, multi-purpose sports hall on the outskirts of the city, a brutalist concrete structure that looked more like an aircraft hangar than a place of scholarly pursuit. As their small convoy pulled into the sprawling car park, Alistair felt his stomach clench. The sheer number of cars, many bearing club stickers and decals from across the state and beyond, was the first sign of the scale of the world they were about to enter.

Stepping from the air-conditioned car into the humid air was like stepping into a furnace. But it was the wall of sound that hit them as they entered the hall that was truly staggering. It was a chaotic, industrial symphony: the high, sharp ring of steel on steel, the percussive thud of rubber-soled feet on a sprung floor, the muffled shouts of instructors, and the constant, ambient roar of a hundred separate conversations. The space was immense, a cavernous hall filled with a bewildering flurry of motion. Banners bearing the crests of different guilds—griffins, bears, wolves, crossed swords—hung from the rafters like the standards of competing armies. Fencers in full gear moved through warm-up drills with an explosive, athletic grace that made the Toowoomba group’s careful, deliberate movements seem ponderous and antique. Alistair watched a fencer practice a series of lunges, his body coiling and uncoiling like a steel spring, covering ten feet of ground in the blink of an eye. The raw power and speed were on a level they had simply never encountered.

His small company huddled together just inside the doorway, a knot of quiet, dark-clothed provincials in a swirling vortex of colour and noise. They were clutching their gear bags like nervous tourists in a foreign port, their faces a mixture of awe and stark terror. Mark’s confident grin had been replaced by a wide-eyed, sober expression. David looked physically ill, as if the sheer sensory overload was about to overwhelm him. Chloe’s face was a mask of professional neutrality, but Alistair could see the tension in her jaw as she took in the scene. He felt a surge of protectiveness, a desperate urge to shepherd them all back into the cars and retreat to the safety of their quiet hill.

They made their way to the registration desk, where a cheerful woman with a Gryphon Sword Guild polo shirt checked their names off a list and handed them welcome packets and lanyards. The transaction was friendly, but it underscored their outsider status. “Fiore di Battaglia Toowoomba,” the woman read off the list. “First time at the Fechtschule? Welcome! The schedule for the workshops is in your packet. The tournament pools will be posted after lunch.” The casual mention of tournament pools sent a fresh wave of anxiety through the group. They were a name on a list, an unknown quantity about to be measured and sorted.

Alistair’s academic presentation was scheduled for the following afternoon, and seeing his name printed in the glossy program—‘Prof. Alistair Finch: *Ars Memoriae* and Martial Pedagogy in Fiore dei Liberi’s *Flos Duellatorum*’—felt utterly surreal, a dispatch from a distant, safer life. For now, his duty was to his students. According to the schedule, the first event was a choice of workshops. One, on the close-in grappling techniques of German longsword, was being taught by a barrel-chested man who looked as though he wrestled refrigerators for fun. The other, taught by the president of the Gryphon Guild himself, was titled ‘Explosive Offence and Controlling the Centreline’. Chloe, ever the strategist, made the decision for them. “We’ll do the offence workshop,” she said quietly to Alistair. “It’s the area we’re weakest in. It will be a shock to the system, but it’s better to face it head-on in a learning environment.”

The workshop was, indeed, a shock. The instructor, a man named Julian, was lean, fast, and moved with a predatory intensity. His philosophy was the polar opposite of their own. Where Alistair preached structure, leverage, and the patient solving of a geometric problem, Julian preached speed, aggression, and overwhelming the opponent’s decision-making process. “The best defence is an attack your opponent is too busy dealing with to launch his own,” he barked, his voice echoing in the hall. The drills were a blur of explosive footwork, rapid-fire combinations, and a constant, forward-driving pressure that was utterly alien to the Toowoomba group. They struggled to keep up, their bodies unused to the sheer anaerobic demands, their minds unable to process the sequences quickly enough. Alistair watched as Mark, his strength rendered useless by an opponent who was simply too fast, became visibly frustrated. David, paired with a wiry, experienced fencer from the host guild, was driven back across the floor, his defensive postures collapsing under the relentless assault.

During a brief water break, Alistair gathered his flock. They were demoralised, gasping for breath, their faces slick with sweat and etched with doubt. He saw their confidence, so carefully nurtured over months, beginning to crumble. “This is not our art,” he said, his voice low and steady amidst the surrounding din. “This is a different dialect, spoken with a different intent. We are not here to master it in ninety minutes. We are here to listen to it. To understand its grammar. Did you see how he uses a feint to draw a parry and then strikes to the newly opened line? That is a principle Fiore also writes about, but executed with a different physical vocabulary. Do not measure yourselves against them. Observe them. We are scholars on a field trip, remember? Take notes.” His words, a deliberate echo of Leo’s wisdom, seemed to re-anchor them. It gave them a different metric for success. They were not failing to keep up; they were succeeding in gathering data. The perspective shift was a shield against despair, allowing them to re-enter the fray not as inferior fighters, but as diligent researchers.
