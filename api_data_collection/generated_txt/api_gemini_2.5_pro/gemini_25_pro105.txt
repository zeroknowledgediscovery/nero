The cold was a physical thing, a presence that seeped through the seams of Barry’s insulated coveralls and settled deep in his bones. It was a January cold, the kind of Winnipeg cold that made metal brittle and breath crystallize into a fine, stinging powder. He was perched on a stepladder in the half-finished basement of a new build in Sage Creek, his fingers, numb even inside his work gloves, painstakingly feeding a 14-gauge wire through a newly drilled hole in a floor joist. The air smelled of sawdust, PVC cement, and the faint, clean scent of ozone that always clung to his clothes. This was his world: a world of colour-coded wires, of precise connections, of the quiet satisfaction that came from bringing light and power into a dark, empty space. A world governed by logic and the unyielding laws of electricity.

And yet, his mind was on pie.

Specifically, a bumbleberry pie from a little bakery on Academy Road. He could almost taste it. The sharp, sweet burst of raspberry and rhubarb, the mellow undertone of Saskatoon berry, all bubbling under a lattice crust so flaky it would shatter at the slightest touch. It was a masterpiece of controlled chaos, a stark contrast to the rigid order of a breaker panel. For Barry Kowalski, a man whose life was a series of straight lines and right angles, pie was the glorious, messy curve. He tugged the wire, feeling for the familiar tension, his mind’s eye no longer on the junction box across the room but on the perfect V-shape a fork would slice from a whole pie. The first bite. The one that held all the promise.

He finished the connection, stripped the wires with a practiced flick of his wrist, and secured them to the terminals. Black to brass, white to silver, the bare copper to the green screw. The mantra was as old as his apprenticeship. He clipped the cover plate on, the crisp snap echoing in the cavernous basement. Job done. For a moment, he just stood there on the ladder, a stocky man in his late thirties with a kind face and hands calloused from years of twisting marettes and hauling BX cable. The site was quiet, the other trades long gone for the day. The only sound was the hum of the temporary generator outside and the whisper of the wind against the plastic-sheeted windows. The silence in the house was a different kind of quiet from the one he sought. This was an empty quiet. The quiet he craved was the full-bellied, contented quiet that followed a truly exceptional piece of pie.

The drive home in his aging Ford Ranger was a ritual of decompression. The truck’s heater wheezed and rattled, fighting a losing battle against the encroaching dusk and the plunging temperature. He drove east, away from the new, sprawling suburbs and back toward the older, more established heart of the city. He lived in a small bungalow in St. Boniface, a house with more character than structural integrity, but it was home. The streets were lined with snowbanks that had grown into grey, monolithic cliffs over the course of the winter, narrowing the roads so that passing another car was an act of quiet negotiation.

He pulled into his driveway, the tires crunching on the packed snow. Through the front window, he could see the warm, yellow light of the living room. He could see Marge moving about inside. A smile touched his lips. Marge. She was the grounding wire in the often-unruly circuit of his life.

The moment he stepped inside, the warmth enveloped him, carrying the scent of roasting garlic and thyme. Marge was at the stove, a wooden spoon in her hand, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun. She looked over her shoulder and gave him the smile that always made the cold of the day melt away.

"Hey Sparky," she said. "Brutal out there?"

"The usual," Barry grunted, kicking off his heavy work boots and leaving them by the door on the rubber mat. "Feels like the wind is coming straight from the North Pole with a grudge."

"Well, get out of those coveralls. Supper’s almost ready. Chicken and roasted potatoes."

"Smells good," he said, and it did. But a small, traitorous part of his brain noted that it did not smell like pie. He shuffled toward the kitchen, peeling off the stiff, insulated shell of his work gear to reveal the jeans and flannel shirt underneath. He wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder and inhaling the scent of her hair.

"You’re cold," she murmured, leaning back into him.

"Just my nose," he said into her neck. "And my fingers. And my toes. And my general will to live."

She laughed, a low, warm sound. "Such a drama queen. It's only minus twenty-seven. It’s not even a proper Winnipeg winter until your eyelashes freeze together." She turned in his arms to face him, her expression turning from amused to serious. "Dave called. Again."

Barry groaned. "About the Pie-Off?"

"Is there anything else Dave calls about?" Marge asked, raising an eyebrow. "He said to remind you that registration closes Friday. And that he’s already scouted the competition at the farmers' market. He says there’s a guy from Brandon who can supposedly unhinge his jaw like a snake."

"Dave says that every year," Barry said, moving to the sink to wash his hands, the hot water a blessed relief on his frozen skin. "And every year, the guy from Brandon turns out to be a retired accountant who taps out after three slices of rhubarb."

"He's just excited for you, Barry."

"I know, I know." He dried his hands, the rough towel a welcome abrasion. The Prairie Pie-Off. It was the regional qualifier for the big one, the Holy Grail: the Canadian National Pie Eating Championship in Toronto. For years, it had been a running joke between him and his work buddy, Dave. They’d watch the highlights on TV, a spectacle of glorious, high-speed gluttony, and Dave would slap him on the back and say, "You could do that, Barry! You’re a natural!" It had started as a laugh, then it became a dare. Then, two years ago, Barry had actually entered the local qualifier. He’d come in second. Last year, he’d won. He’d devoured twelve six-inch meat pies in ten minutes, a feat of gustatory endurance that had earned him a cheap plastic trophy and the undisputed respect of his peers. But he hadn't had the money or the vacation time to even think about going to the nationals. It had been a pipe dream. A cherry-in-the-sky dream, if you will.

This year felt different. He’d been training, in his own way. His methodology was a source of endless amusement for Marge. He’d time himself at family gatherings. He’d developed a technique for crust management—the ‘fold and compress’—to avoid wasting precious stomach capacity on dry pastry. He’d practiced the rhythmic water-sip-and-swallow to aid lubrication. He spoke of pie with the reverence a sommelier spoke of wine, discussing the structural integrity of a meringue, the viscosity of a lemon curd, the optimal fruit-to-filling ratio of a good apple pie. It was, Marge had declared, the nerdiest hobby a man could possibly have.

"So, are you going to?" she asked, turning the chicken in the pan. The sizzle filled the small kitchen.

"I don't know, Mar," he said, leaning against the counter. "It’s one thing to win a local contest against a few farmers and a guy with a gimmick. The nationals... that's a different league. Those guys are professionals."

"You won last year. You beat everyone."

"I got lucky. Old Man Hemlock's tourtière was drier than a popcorn fart. It slowed everyone down."

Marge fixed him with a look, the one that said she wasn't buying a word of his self-deprecation. "Barry Kowalski, you are the most talented pie-eater I have ever met. And I've been to a lot of church potlucks. You have a gift."

He couldn't help but laugh. "A gift for gluttony. My mother would be so proud."

"Your mother would be proud that you're the best at something," she corrected him gently. "Besides, your Grandma Elsie is probably cheering you on from the great beyond. You got the talent from her. I never saw a woman put away a slice of flapper pie like she could."

He smiled at the memory. Grandma Elsie, her kitchen perpetually dusted with flour, a plate of something sweet always ready on the counter. She was the one who had introduced him to the simple, profound joy of a well-made pie. Eating with her had been an event. It wasn't about speed, but about appreciation. Maybe that was his secret weapon. He didn't just shovel it in; he understood it. He respected the pie.

The day of the Prairie Pie-Off arrived cloaked in a deceptive mildness. The temperature had climbed to a balmy minus ten, and the sun, a rare and welcome visitor, cast a brilliant glare off the snow-covered grounds of the Red River Exhibition Park. The event was the centerpiece of a mid-winter festival, a desperate attempt by the city to convince itself that life didn't have to stop just because of a little permafrost. The air smelled of diesel from the food trucks, roasting hot dogs, and the sweet, intoxicating perfume of mini donuts.

Barry felt a familiar knot of anxiety and excitement tighten in his stomach. He’d eaten a light breakfast of dry toast and black coffee, his standard pre-competition meal. Dave was at his side, acting as a combination of coach, hype-man, and amateur bodyguard.

"Okay, champ. Remember the plan," Dave said, his breath pluming in the air. "Round one is blueberry. They're small, mostly filling. Low crust-to-fruit ratio. You can use the dunk method. Don't waste time chewing the skins. Just get 'em down. We're looking for rhythm. A good, steady pace."

"I know, Dave. We've been over this," Barry said, bouncing on the balls of his feet to stay warm.

"And if you see Snake-Jaw from Brandon, don't let him get in your head. It's all psychological."

Barry scanned the lineup of contestants signing in at the registration table. There were a dozen of them, a motley crew of prairie appetites. He saw the university kid from last year, wearing an ironic t-shirt. He saw a woman in a floral parka who looked like she could be a librarian. And then he saw him. A giant of a man with shoulders as wide as a doorway and a thick, grey-streaked beard. He was wearing a seed-company cap and had the calm, unhurried demeanor of a man who regularly wrestled livestock. This wasn't the mythical Snake-Jaw; this was worse. This was a man who looked like he ate for a living.

The contest area was a raised stage with a long table covered in a plastic checkered cloth. A local radio DJ with a painfully enthusiastic voice was whipping up the crowd, a respectable gathering of bundled-up Winnipeggers looking for some free entertainment. Marge was in the front row, holding a hand-drawn sign that read "GO BARRY GO! EAT THE PIE!" She gave him a thumbs-up, her face a mixture of pride and loving embarrassment.

He took his place at the table, the giant farmer to his right. The farmer nodded at him, a simple, direct acknowledgement. "Name's Stan," the man rumbled, his voice like rocks in a tumbler.

"Barry," he replied, shaking the man’s massive, leathery hand.

Then the pies came out. Round one: blueberry. Ten six-inch pies for each contestant. The scent of cooked sugar and fruit filled the air, and for a moment, the competitive edge in Barry softened. They looked good. Really good. He had to remind himself this wasn't for pleasure. This was for victory.

The DJ counted down from ten. The crowd joined in. "THREE! TWO! ONE! GO!"

And the world narrowed. It became just Barry, the pies, and the plastic cup of water. He fell into his rhythm. Grab. Fold. Compress. Shove. Swallow. Sip of water. Repeat. He didn't look at Stan, didn't look at anyone else. He could hear the crowd, a dull roar on the periphery. He could hear the DJ shouting inanities. But mostly, he heard the thumping of his own heart. The first pie vanished in thirty seconds. The second in thirty-five. The blueberry filling was warm and slick, sliding down his throat with practiced ease. The crust was a minor inconvenience, a starchy obstacle to be overcome with a quick compression and a gulp of water. He was a machine. A pie-processing unit. By the five-minute mark, he was on his eighth pie. He risked a glance to his right. Stan was also on his eighth, but he was eating differently. No technique, no folding. Just raw, brute-force consumption, chunks of purple-stained pastry disappearing into the cavern of his beard. A primal force of nature. Barry felt a jolt of pure fear. He pushed it down and grabbed his ninth pie. He was faster, more efficient. But Stan was bigger. It was a race between engineering and raw power.

The ten-minute bell rang, sharp and jarring. Barry dropped the half-eaten crust of his tenth pie. His stomach was a tight, hot ball. His jaw ached. He looked at his station. He had finished nine whole pies and taken three bites of the tenth. He looked at Stan's. The big farmer had also cleared nine pies and had a similar chunk taken out of his last one. It was going to come down to the weigh-in of the leftovers. A judge in a parka and an official-looking lanyard came by with a small digital scale. The tension was thicker than the blueberry filling. After a moment of hushed consultation, the DJ's voice boomed over the speakers.

"Moving on to the final round... from Winnipeg, Barry Kowalski! And from just outside Portage la Prairie, Stan Mielke!"

The crowd cheered. Dave was going ballistic, pumping his fists in the air. Barry felt a surge of adrenaline cut through the bloating. He had made it. But he had to face Stan.

The final round was a Manitoba tradition, a true test of a prairie palate: flapper pie. For the uninitiated, it was a deceptively simple thing: a graham cracker crust filled with a light, creamy custard and topped with a mountain of meringue. It was sweet. Dangerously sweet. And the texture was a nightmare for a speed-eater. The graham crust would turn to sandy sludge in your mouth, and the meringue was like eating a sweetened cloud. There was nothing to grip, nothing to compress. It was pure, slippery chaos.

They placed a single, massive twelve-inch flapper pie in front of each of them. The goal was simple: eat as much as you can in five minutes.

"Good luck," Stan rumbled beside him.

"You too," Barry managed, his mouth already feeling dry.

The bell went again. Barry abandoned all his previous techniques. There was no folding a flapper pie. He grabbed his fork—utensils were allowed in the specialty rounds—and plunged it into the middle. He took a huge mouthful. The sweetness was instantaneous and overwhelming. The custard was cool and smooth, but the meringue was cloying, sticking to the roof of his mouth. He took a swig of water, trying to wash it down. It was like trying to swallow a pillow. He looked over. Stan had eschewed the fork entirely. He had his face buried directly in the pie, coming up for air with his beard and cheeks coated in white meringue and yellow custard. The crowd roared with laughter and delight. It was grotesque. It was magnificent. And it was working.

Barry knew he couldn't compete with that. He had to be smarter. He used his fork to scrape the meringue off to one side, attacking the denser, more substantial custard and crust directly. It was a messy, desperate strategy. Custard splattered his shirt. His hands were sticky. The sugar was making his teeth ache and his head spin. Two minutes in, he felt a wave of nausea. He paused, took a deep breath, and forced it down. He could hear Marge's voice in the crowd, shouting his name. He focused on the sound, using it as an anchor in the swirling sea of sugar. He dug his fork back in. Bite. Swallow. Water. Bite. Swallow. Water. The world was a blur of white and yellow.

The final bell felt like a reprieve from a death sentence. He slumped over the table, his stomach churning in protest. He had eaten, by his estimation, just over half the pie. He dared to look at Stan. The big farmer was leaning back in his chair, breathing heavily. His face was a Jackson Pollock of custard and meringue. What was left of his pie was a cratered wasteland. He had clearly eaten more.

It was over. He had given it his all, but the farmer was just too much. Barry felt a pang of disappointment, but also a strange sense of relief. He had made it to the final. He had lost to a worthy opponent. There was no shame in that. He prepared his congratulatory handshake.

But then the judge was at Stan's side, talking to him quietly. Stan was shaking his head, pointing a sticky finger at a section of his pie. The rule was clear: for a bite to count, it had to be swallowed. On the table, next to Stan's plate, was a significant, semi-chewed pile of meringue he had apparently scraped off his tongue and spat out. It was a rookie mistake. A Reversal of Fortune by Meringue.

The DJ cleared his throat, a dramatic pause hanging in the frozen air. "Folks, after a review by the judges... the winner of the Prairie Pie-Off, and advancing to the Canadian National Pie Eating Championship is... BARRY KOWALSKI!"

The world exploded. The sound hit Barry like a physical blow. Dave was vaulting the barrier, grabbing him in a bear hug that threatened to bring up the entire contents of his stomach. Marge was screaming with joy, her sign held high. Barry couldn't process it. He had won. He had actually won. He saw Stan give him a gracious, sticky nod before being led away by the judges.

They presented him with the trophy, a slightly larger and shinier plastic cup than last year's, and an oversized novelty cheque for five hundred dollars. But more important than any of that was the envelope they handed him. A crisp, white, official-looking envelope. Inside, he knew, was the formal invitation. His ticket to the big show. His chance to go from a St. Boniface electrician with a weird hobby to a national champion. As he stood on the stage, blinking against the flash of a local newspaper photographer's camera, with Marge's arms around his waist and Dave clapping him on the back, he felt a dizzying, pure happiness. It felt like the culmination of everything. The pinnacle. In that moment, holding the envelope that smelled faintly of paper and infinite possibility, he had no idea it was only the beginning.The ride home was a study in contrasts. Dave, crammed into the passenger seat of the Ranger, was still vibrating with manic energy, replaying the contest in excruciating detail. He analyzed Stan’s meringue-spitting foul like a Zapruder film, celebrated Barry’s custard-and-crust strategy as a stroke of genius, and was already brainstorming national-level training regimens involving vats of pudding and industrial quantities of graham crackers. Marge, meanwhile, drove with a serene smile on her face, occasionally reaching over to pat Barry’s knee, her touch a silent question. Barry himself was a silent, bloated monument to victory, staring out at the sodium-lit streets of Winnipeg, his stomach a war zone of sugar and crust. The trophy sat between him and Dave, its cheap plastic glinting under the passing streetlights.

“We need to work on your recovery time,” Dave said, gesturing with a half-eaten bag of mini donuts he’d bought in celebration. “And your liquid intake. Water’s good for local, but the pros use warm green tea. It helps break down the fats in the pastry. We gotta get scientific, buddy. This is Toronto. This is the big league.”

“Dave,” Marge said, her voice gentle but firm. “Let the man digest. I think he’s earned a moment of non-scientific silence.”

Barry grunted in agreement, a sound that felt like it originated somewhere near his spleen. When they pulled into the driveway of the little St. Boniface bungalow, he moved with the slow, deliberate care of a man diffusing a bomb, which in a way, he was. Inside, the trophy looked absurd on their small kitchen table, a gaudy interloper in their cozy, lived-in world. Marge made him a cup of peppermint tea while Dave, unable to contain himself, called half the contacts in his phone to announce the victory. Barry just sat, sipping the hot, minty liquid, feeling the churn in his gut slowly subside. He was a champion. It was the strangest, most uncomfortable feeling in the world.

The next morning, a Sunday, he woke up with what he could only describe as a pie hangover. His jaw was stiff and his stomach felt strangely hollowed out, as if it had been stretched to a new, unnatural capacity and was now slowly, painfully, shrinking back to size. Marge was already up, the scent of coffee a welcome antidote to the phantom smell of meringue that seemed to have permeated his senses. The envelope was on the table next to the salt and pepper shakers. It looked innocuous, but it felt as heavy as a cinder block.

He sat down with a mug of coffee while Marge made toast. He picked up the envelope, his calloused fingers tracing the embossed logo of the Canadian National Pie Eating Championship. He slit it open with a butter knife and pulled out the contents. There was the official letter of congratulations, a dizzying list of rules and regulations, and a registration form that required his signature. The event was in six weeks. In Toronto. At the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. The grand prize was ten thousand dollars and the coveted "Golden Ladle" trophy.

“Ten thousand dollars,” he breathed, the number hanging in the air between them.

“That would fix the roof,” Marge said, placing a plate of toast in front of him. “And the furnace. And we could probably re-wire the garage without you having to do it on your weekends for the next six months.”

“If I won,” Barry added quietly. The ‘if’ was the size of a mountain. He pushed the papers across the table. “Flights, hotel… even if we’re careful, Mar, that’s a couple grand we don’t really have. That novelty cheque for five hundred bucks won’t even cover the flight.”

Marge sat down across from him, her expression serious. She put her hand over his. “So we’ll be a little tight for a few months. We can put it on the credit card. Barry, this isn’t about the money. Not really. How many times do you get to be the best in the country at something? Even if that something is eating pie ridiculously fast.” She squeezed his hand. “You have a gift. A weird, messy, slightly disgusting gift. You can’t just ignore it. Your Grandma Elsie would never forgive you.”

Monday morning brought him crashing back to earth. The job site was a new commercial building on Portage Avenue, a vast, skeletal space where the wind howled through the unfinished window frames, rattling the temporary plastic sheeting. The familiar smell of concrete and steel was a comfort, a return to the world of right angles and logical problems. But the world had followed him here. When he walked into the muster point, a trailer reeking of stale coffee and damp work clothes, a cheer went up. Frank, the foreman, a man whose smiles were as rare as a warm day in February, clapped him on the shoulder.

“Heard you brought home the gold, Kowalski,” he boomed. “Knew you had it in ya. You eat your lunch the same way.”

The ribbing was relentless but good-natured. Plumbers asked him for crust-management tips. Drywallers wanted to know if he was going pro. Dave, working on a different floor, had clearly been an effective town crier. Barry took it all with a sheepish grin, trying to focus on the blueprints for the building’s main electrical room. But even as he traced the complex pathways of conduits and feeders, his mind kept wandering to the viscosity of custard and the structural failure point of a lattice crust. He was an electrician, but a part of him was now, undeniably, a pie-eater.

That night, he opened his laptop. Marge was on the couch, reading a book, a silent, supportive presence. He navigated to the website he’d been avoiding, the official page of the National Championship. It was slick and professional, with slow-motion videos of past glories: confetti cannons, roaring crowds, and champions hoisting the gleaming Golden Ladle. He found the "Contenders" page and scrolled through the profiles of the other regional winners. There was the champion from Quebec, a wiry chef who specialized in tourtière. There was a girl from Vancouver who was a legend on the West Coast hot-dog circuit. And then there was him. The reigning champion. Timothy "The Tsunami" Taggart.

There were videos. Barry clicked on one from last year’s final. Taggart was a man in his late twenties with the lean, hungry look of a wolf. He wasn't big like Stan. He was compact, efficient. The final round had been apple pie, and watching Taggart was like watching a magic trick. There was no joy on his face, no showmanship. Just a cold, terrifying focus. He didn’t use the fold-and-compress. He used a technique Barry had only read about on obscure competitive-eating forums: the chipmunk. He’d stuff his cheeks with massive, unchewed bites of pie, using his tongue and jaw to hold the food while simultaneously swallowing smaller, previously-stored portions, all aided by a rhythmic dip and sip of water. He moved like a piston. It wasn’t eating; it was processing. He inhaled a twelve-inch pie in two minutes and forty-seven seconds.

Barry felt a cold dread that had nothing to do with the Winnipeg winter. It was the feeling of a man who has just realized he’s brought a very good hunting knife to a gunfight. He had beaten Old Man Hemlock and a big farmer with a meringue problem. Taggart looked like he could eat a live bear if there was a cash prize involved.

"What's wrong?" Marge asked, looking up from her book. "You've got your 'I just stripped a live wire' face on."

He turned the laptop so she could see. She watched the video, her eyebrows climbing higher and higher. When it was over, she was silent for a moment. "Okay," she said, closing her book and setting it aside. "So he's a freak of nature."

"He's a machine, Mar. I can't do that. That's not even human."

"No," she said, tapping the screen. "It's a system. A very weird system, but it's a system. And you understand systems. That's what you do. You look at chaos and you make it work." She came and sat next to him, putting an arm around his shoulders. "He's fast, but you're smart. You respect the pie, Barry. That's your secret weapon. That guy doesn't respect the pie. He just wants to destroy it. We just need to figure out how to make your respect faster than his destruction."

Her belief in him was so absolute, so illogical, it bordered on insanity. But it was also the most powerful force he knew. It was the steady, reliable current that made everything else in his life work. He looked from the terrifying video of Timothy Taggart to the registration form still lying on the coffee table. He thought about the roof, and the furnace, and Grandma Elsie. He thought about Marge’s hand-drawn sign and Dave’s ridiculous, unwavering faith. This was bigger than a hobby now. It was a quest.

With a deep breath that did little to calm the frantic flutter in his chest, he picked up a pen. He filled out the form, his blocky, practical handwriting looking out of place on the fancy paper. Name: Barry Kowalski. Age: 38. Representing: The Prairie Region. He signed his name at the bottom. The ink was a dark, definitive slash. There was no turning back now. He was going to Toronto.The ink on the form wasn't even dry when Dave appeared at his door the next evening, stamping snow from his boots. He wasn't empty-handed. In one arm he carried a large whiteboard, and in the other, a thick binder with a label printed in bold block letters: "OPERATION: GOLDEN LADLE." Marge, peeking out from the kitchen, let out a snort of laughter. Barry just sighed, the sound of a man who knew his fate was no longer his own. Dave set up the whiteboard in the middle of their small living room, propping it against a bookshelf and uncapping a dry-erase marker with a decisive click.

“Alright, champ. Phase One begins now,” Dave announced, his voice echoing with self-importance. “Stomach Elasticity and Jaw Mobility.” He drew a crude cross-section of a human stomach on the board, complete with arrows indicating expansion vectors. “We start by increasing capacity. Water-loading. For the next week, you’ll drink a gallon of water in under thirty minutes, every morning. It’ll be uncomfortable. But greatness is forged in discomfort.” On the other side of the board, he scrawled “Jaw Regimen” and underlined it twice. “I’ve got some exercises from a book on training opera singers. We need to get you opening to at least a four-inch vertical. We’re talking a whole meat pie, no folding.”

Barry stared at the whiteboard, then at the earnest, slightly unhinged look on his friend's face. “Dave, I’m an electrician, not a python. And where am I supposed to put a gallon of water? I’ll spend all morning in the porta-potty.”

“Excuses won’t win you ten grand, Kowalski,” Dave retorted, pointing a finger at him. “Timothy ‘The Tsunami’ Taggart isn’t making excuses. Right now, he’s probably swallowing a bag of un-shelled walnuts just to toughen up his esophagus.”

The following weeks transformed the Kowalski household. The kitchen became Barry’s training facility, a laboratory of gluttony. Dave, true to his word, would show up three nights a week with an assortment of pies sourced from across the city, his stopwatch in hand. They were Barry’s sparring partners: dense, stubborn apple pies from a grocery store bakery; slippery, chaotic cream pies; and the dreaded tourtière, whose savoury density could stop a lesser man in his tracks. The kitchen table was a graveyard of crumpled aluminum tins and sticky forks. Barry learned to hate the relentless ticking of the stopwatch and the sight of Dave taking meticulous notes in his binder.

Marge, ever the pragmatist, became the head of logistics. While Barry was force-feeding himself lukewarm lemon meringue, she was on the computer, hunting for deals. The five hundred dollars from the Pie-Off vanished in an instant, swallowed by the cost of two-thirds of a single plane ticket. She found a motel near the Pearson airport that was charitably described as “no-frills,” and she started a small, discreet envelope in the kitchen drawer labelled "Toronto," into which she tucked any spare cash from the grocery budget. She watched Barry’s training sessions with a mixture of clinical interest and wifely concern, offering him peppermint tea after a particularly brutal bout with a Saskatoon berry pie and making sure he ate a salad on his "off" days.

The mental toll was heavier than the physical. Every night, before bed, Barry would watch the videos of Timothy Taggart. He studied the man’s every move: the unnerving stillness before the bell, the explosive first bite, the rhythmic, metronomic dip-and-sip that powered his terrifying efficiency. Taggart was a creature of pure function. One night, spurred by Dave’s relentless goading, Barry tried to emulate the ‘chipmunk’ technique. He took a massive bite of a butter tart, far more than he could chew, and attempted to store it in his cheek while swallowing a previous, smaller mouthful. The result was an immediate, gagging disaster. He spent a minute coughing and sputtering over the sink, his throat burning, the sticky filling clogging his airway.

Marge rushed in, rubbing his back as he gasped for air. Dave stood by, looking horrified. “Okay,” Dave said, his coaching bravado punctured. “Okay, no chipmunking. We scrap the chipmunk.”

Defeated, Barry slumped into a chair, his confidence shattered. “I can’t do it, Mar. I can’t be him. It’s a different species.”

Marge knelt in front of him, wiping a smear of filling from his chin with her thumb. “Then don’t be him,” she said firmly. “Look at me. You tried to use his system, and you almost choked on a butter tart. A butter tart, Barry. That’s not you. He’s all brute force. You’re an electrician. You’re a problem-solver. You don’t fix a short circuit by hitting the breaker panel with a sledgehammer, do you? You find the fault. You find the weakness.”

Her words stuck with him. The next day at work, crouched in a frigid, half-finished office, he was staring at a sprawling, chaotic tangle of wires left by the data crew. It was a mess, a rat’s nest of blue and grey cable. For a moment, he felt that same sense of overwhelming complexity he felt when watching Taggart. But then his training took over. He didn't just rip it all out. He started at one end, methodically tracing a single line, isolating it from the chaos, understanding its path. Path of least resistance. That was the key.

That evening, a shift occurred. He asked Marge to bake a pie, a classic apple, but to make the crust extra thick and tough on one side. When Dave arrived with his stopwatch, Barry didn't rush. He looked at the pie for a full ten seconds, assessing it. He saw the weak point, where the tougher crust met the softer, more yielding filling. He attacked there first, using his fork to breach the pastry dam, allowing the filling to spill out. He didn’t fight the crust; he worked with it, breaking it into manageable pieces and using the moisture of the filling to help it down. He wasn’t as fast as Taggart, not even close, but his rhythm was smooth and unbroken. There was no gagging, no struggle. He finished the pie a full minute faster than his previous personal best. He had found his system. Not Taggart's system. His system.

The news of his quest had spread beyond their small circle. The little bakery on Academy Road, the one with the bumbleberry pie that had started it all, put a sign in their window: “Good Luck in Toronto, Barry ‘The Pie-Man’ Kowalski!” The owner, a kindly woman named Mrs. Dubois, refused to take his money anymore, pressing boxes of "training materials" into his hands whenever he stopped by. At the job site, a collection had been taken up. Frank the foreman presented him with a crumpled envelope containing three hundred and forty-seven dollars in assorted bills. “For a decent hotel,” Frank had grunted. “Can’t have our guy sleeping in a dumpster. It’s bad for the union’s image.”

Finally, the day of departure arrived. The six weeks of training had flown by in a blur of pastry and panic. The Winnipeg airport was a sterile, brightly lit bubble against the profound, deep-freeze darkness of the prairie night. Dave, unable to check his whiteboard, carried his binder like a sacred text. Marge clutched the boarding passes, her face alight with nervous excitement. Barry, leaner than he’d been in years despite the absurd diet, felt a strange calm settle over him. He had done the work. He had a strategy. He had his team. He looked out the massive window at the flat, snow-blown tarmac, the air so cold it made the machinery of the baggage carts seem to move in slow motion. He was leaving the world of 14-gauge wire and right angles for a stage, a national audience, and a man who ate like a human tsunami. He was terrified. And he couldn’t wait.The transition from the frozen, horizontal expanse of the prairies to the vertical chaos of Toronto was a form of atmospheric whiplash. As the plane descended, the view changed from an abstract grid of snow-dusted farmland to a sprawling, incandescent web of light that seemed to have no end. It was a city that didn't know how to be quiet or dark. The air that greeted them as they stepped out of the airport wasn't the clean, biting cold of Winnipeg; it was a damp, raw chill that clung to their clothes and felt heavier in their lungs, thick with the exhaust of a million cars and the vague, metallic scent of the lake.

Their motel, located in a liminal space of highways and industrial parks, was exactly what Marge’s research had promised: a clean, anonymous room with two double beds, a television bolted to the wall, and a window that overlooked a sprawling parking lot. The beige-and-brown colour scheme seemed designed to induce a state of complete emotional neutrality. Dave, however, was impervious to the bleak decor. He immediately claimed the small desk, setting up his binder and a packet of printouts profiling the other competitors.

"Okay, intel update," he said, tapping a photo of the Quebecois chef. "Jean-Pierre 'The Pâtissier' Lavoie. His weakness is speed on non-savory pies. He savors too much. We can exploit that in the fruit rounds."

Barry dropped his duffel bag by the bed and sat down heavily, the mattress sighing under his weight. He looked at Marge, who was methodically unpacking their shared suitcase, hanging up his competition flannel shirt and her own nice sweater with a quiet efficiency that was both calming and deeply familiar. He was in a strange room in a strange city, about to engage in a contest of televised gluttony, and Marge was making sure his shirt wouldn't be wrinkled. The absurdity of it all was a warm, comforting blanket.

The following day, they took the airport express train downtown to the convention centre for registration. The building was a modern cathedral of glass and steel, a place so vast and impersonal it made the Portage Avenue commercial build feel like a garden shed. Inside, the air hummed with a low-level corporate buzz. They followed the signs for the Canadian National Pie Eating Championship, their parkas and worn-in boots marking them as outsiders amidst the streams of businesspeople in tailored suits.

The registration area was set up in a cavernous hall, a designated pocket of bizarre Americana in the heart of polished Canadian commerce. A long table was staffed by unnervingly cheerful volunteers in bright yellow t-shirts. On a small stage, a crew was setting up lights and cameras. This was where it became real. Barry saw them instantly: his fellow competitors. They were a scattered tribe, easily identifiable by their shared aura of nervous energy. He recognized Jean-Pierre Lavoie from Dave’s printout, a slender man with a neat goatee who was stretching his jaw with the delicate precision of a concert violinist. He saw the girl from Vancouver, her hair dyed a shocking pink, rhythmically chugging a two-litre bottle of water. They weren’t farmers and retired accountants. They were specialists.

He was handed a lanyard with a laminated badge that read: BARRY KOWALSKI - PRAIRIE REGION. He held it in his hand, the plastic cool and smooth. It felt like a fake ID, a pass into a world where he didn't belong. He was just putting it over his head when a sudden hush fell over a small group nearby. A space seemed to clear around one man, who was speaking quietly with a woman holding a microphone and a "National Eats Network" flag. It was Timothy "The Tsunami" Taggart.

The videos had not lied, but they hadn't told the whole truth. Taggart was of average height and build, but he carried himself with an unnerving stillness, a coiled-spring economy of motion. His eyes, a pale, washed-out blue, seemed to see everything and register nothing. They weren't the eyes of an athlete; they were the eyes of a predator, constantly assessing, calculating, looking for the fatal weakness. Dressed in a plain black tracksuit, he looked less like he was there to eat pie and more like he was there to dismantle a bomb with his teeth.

"Go on, give him the prairie death stare," Dave whispered, nudging Barry. "Let him know you're not intimidated."

Barry didn't move. He couldn't. He was an electrician who had just come face to face with a nuclear reactor. As the interview concluded, Taggart turned, his gaze sweeping coolly over the room. For a fraction of a second, his eyes met Barry's. There was no flicker of recognition, no sizing up of a potential rival. It was the brief, dismissive glance one might give a piece of furniture that was momentarily in the way. Then he looked past him, his focus already elsewhere, on a reality Barry couldn't even perceive. The dismissal was more unnerving than any threat could have been. To Timothy Taggart, Barry Kowalski did not even exist.

“Okay, new plan,” Marge said, her voice low and steady. She took Barry’s arm, her grip firm and grounding. “We are going to leave this giant, soulless building. We’re going to go find the best, most authentic, non-competition food this city has to offer. And we are not going to talk about pie for at least three hours.”

That night, back in the quiet beige of the motel room, the pressure began to close in. Dave was asleep in the other bed, his binder resting on his chest like a shield, his soft snores a testament to a day of diligent coaching. Marge was reading, the small lamp by her bed casting a warm pool of light. Barry lay on his back, staring at the textured ceiling, his mind replaying that one dismissive glance from Taggart over and over. He wasn't just an underdog; he was an irrelevance.

“You’re thinking too loud,” Marge murmured, not looking up from her book.

“He didn’t even see me,” Barry said, his voice barely a whisper. “I’m just another guy he has to get through. A name on a list.”

Marge finally closed her book, marking her page with a receipt from the ramen shop they'd found. She turned onto her side to face him. “So what? Do you think a breaker panel ‘sees’ you when you walk up to it? Do you think a floor joist cares who’s drilling a hole in it? No. You show up, you assess the problem, and you do the work. You’re not there to impress him, Barry. You’re there to eat pie.”

He was silent, listening to the hum of the ice machine down the hall and the distant whoosh of traffic on the highway. “Frank and the guys gave me over three hundred bucks,” he said, shifting the topic. “And Mrs. Dubois… she gave me a whole box of butter tarts for the plane. Said they were for ‘moral support.’”

“Because they believe in you,” Marge said softly. “All of them. They’re not betting on you to be the next Tsunami. They’re betting on Barry Kowalski from St. Boniface, the guy who gets a goofy look on his face when he talks about a good lattice crust. That’s who they sent here. That’s who I’m here with.” She reached across the small space between their beds and took his hand. Her hand was warm, her grip sure. "So, you go out there tomorrow, and you be him. Just be him. And eat the damn pie."

Her words were the grounding wire he needed. The fear didn't vanish, but it shifted. It was no longer a paralyzing dread, but a low, thrumming energy. He wasn't Timothy Taggart. He wasn't a machine. He was a man who loved pie, a man whose community had chipped in to send him here, a man whose wife believed he could solve any problem, even one that came served in a twelve-inch tin. He squeezed her hand, his calloused fingers wrapping around hers. Tomorrow, he would face the Tsunami. And he would do it his way.The morning of the competition dawned not with a bang, but with the quiet, electronic beep of the motel room’s alarm clock. It was an apologetic sound, as if it knew it was intruding. Barry was already awake, lying still and watching the grey Toronto light filter through the gap in the curtains. He felt a profound and unsettling stillness inside him, the kind of quiet that precedes a massive electrical load being thrown onto a grid. Beside him, Marge stirred, her breathing steady and deep. In the other bed, Dave was a coiled spring of anxiety, already dressed in a fresh polo shirt emblazoned with a custom iron-on that read "KOWALSKI PIE CREW," a last-minute creation he'd proudly unveiled the night before.

“Hydration is key, champ,” Dave whispered hoarsely, already on his feet and thrusting a bottle of water at Barry. “Not too much, not too little. We’re aiming for optimal esophageal lubrication, not a full-blown water load. The rules state—” Barry held up a hand, cutting him off gently. He sat up, the strange mattress creaking in protest, and took the water. He took a small, measured sip, just as he would back home, the ritual a small piece of St. Boniface in this alien room. Marge was already at the small counter, coaxing a murky-looking coffee from the single-serve machine, her movements calm and deliberate. She was his constant, the 60-hertz cycle that kept his world running smoothly. She handed him a mug and her eyes met his, conveying everything that didn't need to be said: *You can do this. Just be you.*

Back in the cavernous hall of the convention centre, the atmosphere had transformed. The low-level buzz of the previous day had escalated into a full-throated roar. A crowd of several hundred people filled the tiered seating, a mixture of die-hard competitive eating fans, curious tourists, and media from niche food blogs and the National Eats Network. The air was thick with the smell of baking sugar, hot lights, and a collective, hungry anticipation. Backstage, in the cordoned-off competitors' area, the nervous energy was a palpable force. Jean-Pierre Lavoie was doing delicate breathing exercises, while the pink-haired girl from Vancouver bounced on the balls of her feet, listening to heavy metal through oversized headphones. And at the far end of the area, sitting on a folding chair, was Taggart. He was utterly still, eyes closed, a picture of absolute focus. He wasn't warming up; he was calibrating.

Then came the introductions. A host with a slick suit and a voice polished by years of radio work boomed their names over the sound system, each one accompanied by a blast of rock music. When he announced "From Winnipeg, Manitoba, the prairie powerhouse, Barry ‘The Pie-Man’ Kowalski!", Barry felt a jolt of surreal dislocation. He walked onto the brightly lit stage, blinking against the glare, and found his place at the long, checkered table. His station was identical to the one in Winnipeg, yet worlds away. He scanned the crowd and found them instantly: Dave, leaning forward so intensely he looked like he might fall over the barrier, and Marge, standing beside him, her expression one of fierce, unwavering pride. She gave him a small, almost imperceptible nod. It was all the coaching he needed.

The first round was classic cherry pie, ten six-inchers per contestant. The bell shrieked, a jarring summons to battle. All around him, motion exploded. Forks plunged, faces dove, and a flurry of red filling and pastry flew. Barry forced himself to be still for a single, critical second. He picked up his first pie. He wasn't a Tsunami, he was an electrician. He assessed the object in front of him. The crust was uniformly browned, but the filling had bubbled higher on one side, indicating a slightly softer, more saturated pastry beneath. That was his entry point. He broke the crust there, the fork sinking in with a satisfying give. The warm, sweet-tart filling became his ally, a lubricant for the drier crust.

He fell into a rhythm born of weeks of training in his small kitchen. It was a sequence of precise, efficient movements: breach the crust, scoop the filling, break a piece of pastry, and swallow. It was a controlled demolition, not a chaotic explosion. He risked a single glance down the table. Taggart was a whirlwind of methodical destruction. He wasn’t eating; he was processing, his chipmunk technique on full display, his cheeks expanding and contracting with a terrifying, pneumatic rhythm. He was already on his third pie while Barry was finishing his second. A familiar spike of panic lanced through Barry’s gut. He tore his eyes away, focusing on the plate in front of him, on the scent of cherry and baked dough, on Marge’s face in the crowd. His race. His pace.

When the ten-minute bell rang, Barry dropped his fork with a clatter. His chest was tight, his stomach a hot, dense ball of fruit and flour. He had cleared eight whole pies, a personal best. He looked up, breathing heavily. Taggart’s station was empty save for a few red smears. He had finished all ten with more than a minute to spare. But it wasn’t an elimination round; it was about qualifying for the semis. The host read the names of the top eight who would advance. “...and with a formidable eight pies, Barry Kowalski!” The crowd offered a smattering of applause for the unknown name. He had survived. As he stepped away from the table, Dave clapped him on the back, breathless. "Your pace was consistent! Your crust-to-filling ingestion ratio was almost perfect!" Marge just handed him a bottle of water, a clean napkin, and a smile that said, "I knew it."

The semi-final round raised the stakes considerably. Before them, the volunteers placed a single, large pie, but this time it was lemon meringue. A collective groan and cheer went through the crowd. This was a technical challenge, a test of strategy over brute force. The mountain of airy, sticky meringue was a nightmare, a high-volume, low-density obstacle that could clog the throat and waste precious stomach space. Barry looked at the glistening, towering confection and felt a flash of his butter-tart disaster. He could hear Marge’s voice in his head: *Don’t hit it with a sledgehammer.*

The bell rang again. This time, Barry didn't hesitate. While others, including Jean-Pierre Lavoie beside him, dug straight into the center, Barry took his fork and used it like a spade. In a series of swift, decisive movements, he scraped the entire mountain of meringue off the top and pushed it to the far side of his plate. It was an unorthodox move, and a murmur rippled through the audience. He was ignoring a huge portion of the pie. But Barry knew the rules: the winner was decided by weight. Meringue was mostly air; the real weight, the real substance, was in the dense, heavy lemon curd and the graham cracker crust. He had bypassed the insulation and gone straight for the conductor.

Now he had a clear field. He attacked the exposed curd and crust with a ferocious, focused energy. The tartness of the lemon cut through the lingering sweetness of the cherry, shocking his palate back to life. He was aware of Lavoie beside him struggling, his face a mess of white foam, his elegant technique useless against the sugary chaos. He was aware of Taggart at the end of the table, who had adopted a similar but more aggressive strategy, ramming the meringue down with his fork before attacking the base. But Barry was in his own world, his system working perfectly. He was the problem-solver from St. Boniface, and this was just a complex circuit of sugar and starch.

The final bell felt like a reprieve. He had eaten what felt like a ton of pure lemon and butter, and his stomach was churning in protest. He had no idea if it was enough. The judges, armed with clipboards and scales, moved down the line, weighing the remains. The host’s voice crackled with excitement. He announced the first finalist: "Unsurprisingly, the reigning champion, Timothy 'The Tsunami' Taggart!" Then he paused, building the drama. "And in a stunning display of strategy, our second finalist... the man who deconstructed the meringue... from Winnipeg, Barry Kowalski!"

The world tilted. The roar from the crowd was louder this time, a genuine cheer for the underdog. He had done it. He was in the final. Dave was screaming himself hoarse, shaking the barrier. Marge had her hands over her mouth, her eyes shining. Barry pushed himself up from the table, his body aching but his spirit soaring. He looked down the long table, and he saw Taggart, wiping his mouth with a crisp napkin. The champion was looking straight at him now, and for the first time, the pale blue eyes held a flicker of something new. It wasn't respect, not yet. It was something closer to curiosity. Barry Kowalski was no longer just a name on a list. He was a problem. And the final round, with the Golden Ladle on the line, was only minutes away.The break between rounds was an eternity compressed into five minutes. Stagehands in black t-shirts scurried to clear the debris of the semi-final, their movements swift and practiced. They wiped down the checkered tablecloth, replaced the water cups, and set out fresh forks, resetting the universe for the final act. Soon, only two stations remained, starkly isolated at the center of the long table under the full, unforgiving glare of the television lights. The roar of the crowd had subsided into a thick, expectant hush, the collective breath of hundreds held in suspense. Barry stood by his designated spot, his legs feeling strangely disconnected from his body, his stomach a tight, acidic knot. He could feel the warmth of the lights on his face, a stark contrast to the icy dread coiling in his gut.

Across the stage, Timothy Taggart stood with a similar stillness, but his was of a different quality. Barry’s was the stillness of a man bracing for impact; Taggart’s was the stillness of a machine in standby mode, power humming just below the surface. For the first time, the champion turned his head and looked directly at Barry, a long, appraising stare that was devoid of malice but heavy with analytical precision.

“The meringue,” Taggart said, his voice flat and even, carrying easily in the quiet hall. “That was smart. Most people fight it.”

The words were so unexpected they almost didn't register. It wasn't a taunt or a threat, but a clinical observation, a peer-to-peer acknowledgement from one technician to another. Barry, his own throat raw from the lemon curd, could only manage a nod. “You gotta find the weak point,” he rasped, the words sounding gravelly and foreign to his own ears. It was a line straight from the job site, a principle of his trade, and it felt like the truest thing he could possibly say.

Taggart’s lips quirked in what might have been the ghost of a smile, a minute shift in his facial mechanics. “There’s always a weak point.” He turned his gaze back to the front, his brief moment of connection over. The message was clear: *I see you now. And I will find yours.*

The host returned to the center of the stage, his voice amplified to fill every corner of the hall. “Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we’ve all been waiting for! The final round of the Canadian National Pie Eating Championship! For the Golden Ladle, ten thousand dollars, and a year’s worth of bragging rights, our two finalists will have five minutes to consume as much of one final pie as possible!” He paused for dramatic effect. “And this year, for the ultimate test of skill, heart, and capacity, our final pie is a taste of the challenger’s home turf… a twelve-inch, deep-dish, Manitoba Bumbleberry Pie!”

The name hit Barry like a physical jolt. Bumbleberry. The pie from Academy Road. The pie that filled his daydreams in that cold, half-finished basement a lifetime ago. The masterpiece of controlled chaos. The glorious, messy curve. As the volunteers placed the final pies on the table, the scent reached him first—a warm, complex perfume of baked pastry, bubbling fruit, and caramelized sugar. It wasn't just a competition pie; it was the smell of a winter daydream made real. He looked at the pie in front of him. The lattice crust was a perfect golden brown, dusted with coarse sugar that glittered under the lights. Through the gaps, the dark, purple-red filling bubbled thickly, a chaotic jumble of raspberries, rhubarb, and Saskatoon berries. It was beautiful. It was perfect. And he was about to destroy it.

The final bell screamed. The world snapped into a tight, frantic focus. Taggart moved with a violence that was breathtaking. He didn't use his fork. He grabbed the pie tin with both hands, lifted it, and plunged his face directly into the center, ripping a huge chunk out with his teeth. The crowd roared. It was primal, shocking, and brutally effective. He came up for a split second, his face smeared with purple filling, and went back in, the chipmunk technique adapted for maximum carnage.

Barry felt a wave of pure, unadulterated panic. He couldn't do that. He would choke. He would fail. *Your system, Barry. Not his.* Marge’s voice. He grabbed his fork, his knuckles white. He knew this pie. He respected this pie. He plunged the fork into the center, not with Taggart’s raw fury, but with the focused intent of a man opening a junction box. He knew the rhubarb would provide structural weakness in the filling. He leveraged it, scooping a huge mouthful that was a perfect ratio of soft fruit to yielding crust. The taste exploded in his mouth—a sharp, sweet, tangy burst that was both agonizingly delicious and an obstacle to be overcome. He swallowed, the familiar burn a signal of progress. Sip of water. Repeat.

It was a race between two opposing philosophies. Taggart was a hurricane, tearing the pie apart from the outside in, leaving a trail of beautiful destruction. Barry was a demolition expert, working from the inside out, methodically disassembling the structure. He used the edge of his fork to cut the lattice crust into a grid, then used the soft, wet filling to help slide the starchy pastry down. He ignored the roaring of the crowd, the frantic commentary of the host, the ticking clock that was now a drumbeat in his blood. There was only the pie, the fork, and the next bite.

Three minutes in, he hit the wall. His stomach, already packed with cherry and lemon, sent up a screaming protest. Every muscle in his jaw ached with a deep, grinding fatigue. The sweetness of the pie had turned cloying, each swallow a monumental effort of will. He faltered, his rhythm breaking for the first time. He looked up, gasping, and his eyes found Marge. She wasn't shouting or jumping like Dave, who looked like he was about to spontaneously combust. She was just standing there, her hands clasped in front of her, her gaze locked on his. Her face was a beacon of calm, unwavering faith. In her eyes, he wasn't a glutton on a stage; he was her Barry, the man who could fix anything. He thought of the guys at work and their crumpled envelope of cash. He thought of Mrs. Dubois and her gift of butter tarts. He thought of his Grandma Elsie, her flour-dusted apron, and the simple joy of a shared slice. He was not a machine. He was powered by all of them.

The thought was a surge of fresh current through a failing circuit. He lowered his head and dug his fork back in. The bites were smaller now, more ragged, but they were relentless. He could see Taggart, still eating with terrifying speed, but his pace had slowed too. A fine sheen of sweat covered the champion’s face, and his movements were becoming ragged, less machine-like and more human. He was hitting the same wall. The final minute felt like an hour. Every second stretched, thick and heavy as pie filling. The crowd was on its feet, a single roaring entity. The host was counting down the final ten seconds. “FIVE! FOUR!” Barry scraped one last, desperate forkful. “THREE! TWO!” He forced it into his mouth, his throat closing in protest. “ONE!” He swallowed, a painful, final gulp, as the bell rang out, sharp and merciful as a guillotine.

Silence. He slumped forward, his forehead coming to rest on the sticky, checkered tablecloth, his entire body trembling with exhaustion and a massive sugar overdose. He couldn't move. He couldn't think. All he could hear was the frantic, ragged sound of his own breathing, punctuated by the heavy gasps of the man a few feet away. It was over.

Slowly, painfully, he pushed himself upright. He looked at his pie tin. It was a wasteland, a crater of purple and gold, with only a few ragged strips of crust clinging to the edges. He looked at Taggart’s. It was a scene of even greater carnage, a pure expression of scorched-earth consumption. The champion had eaten more. Barry knew it. He had given everything, but the machine was just too powerful. A wave of profound disappointment washed over him, but it was quickly followed by a strange, quiet pride. He had come this far. He had faced the Tsunami and hadn't been swept away. He had made him work for it.

The judges, their faces grim with the seriousness of their task, descended with the digital scales. The tension in the hall was absolute. They weighed the remains of Taggart’s pie first, a hushed conference between two officials, a number scribbled on a clipboard. Then they moved to Barry’s. He watched, detached, as they lifted his tin. He saw Marge and Dave, frozen in place, their hands gripping the barrier. He prepared his congratulatory smile for Taggart.

The host walked to the center of the stage, the clipboard in his hand. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “I have never, in ten years of hosting this event, seen a final this close.” He held up the clipboard. “The rules are simple. Victory goes to the person who has consumed the most pie by weight. After consuming an inhuman amount of food, the difference between our two champions… comes down to a matter of grams.”

The air crackled. Barry’s heart hammered against his ribs.

“The winner of the Golden Ladle… the new Canadian National Pie Eating Champion… by a margin of just twelve grams… from Winnipeg, Manitoba… BARRY KOWALSKI!”

The name didn’t compute. The words were just sounds, disconnected from meaning. And then the world exploded. A cannon fired a blast of confetti into the air. The roar of the crowd was a physical blow, a wave of sound that washed over him. Dave vaulted the barrier, a wild cry escaping his lips as he grabbed Barry in a hug that nearly sent them both to the floor. And then Marge was there, her arms wrapping around him, her face buried in his shoulder, her body shaking with joyful sobs.

Through the chaos, Barry looked up. He saw Timothy Taggart. The champion was standing perfectly still amidst the swirling confetti, his face unreadable. He looked at the judges, then at the scoreboard, then at Barry. He stared for a long moment, a machine processing an impossible result. Then, slowly, he walked over. He extended a sticky, purple-stained hand. Barry, numb and bewildered, took it. Taggart’s grip was firm.

“Twelve grams,” Taggart said, his voice a low murmur. “Your crust work. It was more efficient.” He gave a single, sharp nod—a gesture of pure, unadulterated professional respect. Then he turned and walked off the stage, leaving Barry standing in the center of his own impossible victory.

They placed the absurd, gleaming Golden Ladle in his hands and the oversized cheque against his chest. As the cameras flashed, blinding him, he held the trophy tight, its weight a solid, grounding presence. He looked at Marge, her face streaked with tears and smiling the smile that had always been his true north. He looked at Dave, who was now attempting to lead the crowd in a chant of "BAR-RY! BAR-RY!". He had done it. The electrician from St. Boniface, the man who dreamed of pie. He looked down at the trophy, then back at the half-eaten masterpiece on the table. It wasn’t about the money, or the trophy, or even the glory. It was about the beautiful, logical, and deeply respectful deconstruction of a chaotic thing. It was about seeing the problem, finding the path of least resistance, and bringing light to a dark space. And in that moment, he felt the same quiet, profound satisfaction he always felt at the end of a long day, the feeling of a job well and truly done.The world after the confetti was a sticky, muffled place. The adrenaline that had surged through Barry’s veins, a high-voltage current that had powered him through the final, agonizing bites, receded with shocking speed, leaving behind a humming, cavernous exhaustion. He vaguely remembered a series of flash-bulbs that felt like small explosions in front of his eyes and the incoherent babble of questions from people holding microphones. He answered by rote, the words coming out slow and thick, his jaw feeling as though the hinges had been replaced with rusty bolts. The only solid things in the universe were Marge’s hand, cool and steady on the small of his back, and Dave’s arm, slung over his shoulder in a grip of proprietary pride, a grip that smelled faintly of sweat and mini donuts.

The taxi ride back to the motel was a study in silence. The Golden Ladle sat on the seat between Barry and Marge, its absurdly polished surface reflecting the passing blur of highway lights. It was an artifact from another reality, a gleaming intruder in their world of worn denim and practical footwear. Dave, for the first time in forty-eight hours, was speechless, staring at the trophy with a look of profound, religious awe, as if he had just witnessed a miracle and was afraid to speak lest he break the spell. Marge simply watched Barry, her brow furrowed with a gentle concern that was more comforting than any words. Barry leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, his stomach a slow-motion chemical reaction, and watched the unfamiliar city slide by, feeling less like a conquering hero and more like a man who had made a terrible, glorious mistake.

Back in the beige-and-brown neutrality of the motel room, the spell shattered. Dave, finally rebooting, began to pace the narrow strip of carpet between the beds, his voice a torrent of manic possibility. “This is just the beginning, champ! We need an agent. We need to talk to a branding expert. ‘The Pie-Man from the Prairies’—it’s gold! I’m thinking regional grocery store endorsements. Maybe a line of specialty pie-eating forks! We have to strike while the oven is hot, Barry! Next year’s defense will be a media circus!” Marge gently took the Golden Ladle from Barry’s nerveless grasp and placed it on the desk, where it sat beside the Gideon Bible, an idol of a strange new faith. Barry just sank onto the edge of the bed, the mattress groaning. The very thought of another pie, let alone a lifetime of them, sent a wave of nausea through him.

He excused himself and stood under a stream of scalding water for a long time, trying to scrub the lingering scent of sugar and cooked fruit from his skin. He watched the last flecks of purple filling and silver confetti swirl down the drain, but the feeling of being someone else, of being this “Pie-Man,” clung to him more stubbornly than the stickiness. Staring at his reflection in the steamy mirror, he saw not a champion, but just a stocky, tired-looking man with kind eyes that were currently bloodshot with exhaustion. He had a smudge of dried berry on his earlobe that he had somehow missed. This was the face of the best competitive pie-eater in Canada. It looked a lot like the face of an electrician who had just worked a sixteen-hour shift in the dead of winter. The disconnect was a dizzying chasm.

When he emerged, wrapped in a towel, the room was quiet. Dave had finally succumbed to his own vicarious exhaustion and was sprawled on his bed, fast asleep with his “KOWALSKI PIE CREW” shirt still on. Marge was sitting on their bed, patiently waiting. The Golden Ladle gleamed in the soft light of the single lamp. Barry sat down beside her, the mattress dipping. The silence stretched, filled only by the hum of the mini-fridge and Dave’s soft snores. “What now, Mar?” he finally whispered, the question he’d been holding back all night. She didn’t look at the trophy or the oversized cheque that was propped against it. She looked at him. “Now,” she said, her voice soft and practical, “we get a good night’s sleep. We fly home tomorrow. And then, we call a roofer about that leak over the kitchen.” She took his hand. “The money is real, Barry. That’s the important part. It’s a new furnace. It’s peace of mind.” She was, as always, his grounding wire, connecting the spectacular, high-voltage win back to the simple, low-voltage circuit of their life.

The next morning, Barry awoke to the full, brutal reality of what he’d done to his body. It was a pie hangover of biblical proportions. His mouth tasted like old pennies and his stomach felt like it had been filled with expanding foam. Every joint ached. He moved with the slow, pained deliberation of a very old man, shuffling to the bathroom to splash cold water on his face. In the other bed, Dave was already awake, scrolling through his phone with a giddy expression. “We’re on the national sports website, buddy! They’re calling it the ‘Upset of the Decade’! There’s a comment section! You have fans!” Barry groaned and retreated back to the relative safety of his bed, pulling a pillow over his head.

Navigating the airport was a fresh ordeal. The Golden Ladle, carefully wrapped in a sweatshirt and placed in Marge’s carry-on, set off the alarm at the security checkpoint. A stern-faced agent pulled the bag aside for inspection. “Ma’am, what is this object?” he asked, pulling out the swaddled trophy. Marge, without missing a beat, unwrapped it. “It’s a ladle,” she said plainly. The agent stared at the gleaming, oversized utensil. “A ladle? For what, soup for a giant?” Dave, unable to help himself, puffed out his chest. “It’s the Golden Ladle. He,” he said, pointing a thumb at Barry, who was trying to become invisible behind a potted plant, “won the National Pie Eating Championship yesterday.” The agent looked from the trophy to Barry’s pale, uncomfortable face, and then back to the trophy. A slow grin spread across his face. “No kidding? I saw that on the highlights! You’re the guy who scraped off the meringue! That was brilliant!” Suddenly, Barry wasn’t an anonymous traveler anymore. He was a minor celebrity, and it was the most awkward he had ever felt in his life.

On the flight home, as the plane climbed above the grey blanket of clouds, Barry stared out the small oval window, the trophy tucked securely at his feet. The manic energy of Toronto receded below, and soon there was only the peaceful, blue-and-white infinity of the sky. He was suspended between two worlds: the chaotic, exhilarating stage he was leaving behind, and the quiet, predictable life that awaited him. He could hear a man a few rows ahead of him telling his seatmate about the competition. “…and this guy from Winnipeg, some electrician, came out of nowhere and beat Taggart. Just dismantled him with strategy. Twelve grams! Can you believe it?” Barry slouched a little lower in his seat, a hot flush of embarrassment and pride creeping up his neck.

They landed in Winnipeg in the late afternoon. The air that greeted them as they stepped into the jet bridge was the familiar, dry, shocking cold that felt like home. It smelled of clean snow and distance. Barry’s shoulders, which had been tensed for three days, finally began to relax. He was back in his world of straight lines and right angles. All he wanted was to get their bags, get into his aging Ranger, and drive home to the comfortable quiet of his own small bungalow. But as they rounded the corner into the arrivals hall, they stopped. A small, cheerful crowd was gathered by the baggage carousels. He saw Frank the foreman and a half-dozen of the guys from the Portage Avenue site, holding a large, hand-painted banner on a piece of drywall that read, “OUR SPARKY BRINGS HOME THE GOLD!” He saw Mrs. Dubois from the Academy Road bakery, beaming, holding a white bakery box tied with a bright red ribbon. And, standing off to the side, was a reporter and a cameraman from the local news, the camera’s red light already on. Marge squeezed his hand tightly. Dave let out a triumphant whoop. The quiet, orderly world he had left behind had been waiting for him. It had seen what he had done, and it had turned out to greet the glorious, messy curve he had become.The warmth of the arrivals hall did little to thaw the frozen knot of apprehension in Barry’s gut. For a moment, he just stood there, a deer caught in the headlights of his own welcome party. The banner, crudely but affectionately painted on a spare sheet of drywall, was a testament to the surreal turn his life had taken. Frank the foreman, a man who typically communicated in grunts and curt nods, was grinning from ear to ear, his arm pumping a celebratory fist in the air. The sight was so unnatural it was almost frightening. Marge squeezed his hand, a silent signal of reinforcement, while Dave let out a triumphant whoop that echoed in the cavernous space, drawing the attention of other travelers.

“Attaboy, Sparky!” Frank boomed as they drew closer, his voice a gravelly roar. He clapped Barry on the shoulder with a hand the size and texture of a leather work glove, a gesture of affection so forceful it nearly sent Barry stumbling into a baggage carousel. “Knew you had it in ya! Showed that Toronto hotshot how we do things on the prairie!” The rest of the crew from the site cheered, their faces, chapped and reddened by the Winnipeg winter, beaming with genuine pride. This wasn’t just his victory; it was theirs. He was their champion, the local boy who had gone to the big city and wrestled a prize from its slick, indifferent grasp.

Mrs. Dubois, her kind face crinkled with smile lines, bustled forward, pushing a pristine white bakery box into his hands. “Just a little something to welcome you home, Barry,” she said, her voice warm and maternal. “No stopwatches this time, I promise. Just for enjoying.” He looked down at the box, the familiar logo of the Academy Road bakery a comforting anchor in the swirling chaos. The thought of what was inside, likely a perfect, non-competitive bumbleberry pie, made his stomach churn in protest, but his heart swelled with a profound, aching gratitude.

Before he could properly thank her, the local news reporter, a young woman with determined eyes and a microphone bearing the logo of a station he usually only watched for the weather forecast, was in front of him. “Barry! Congratulations! How does it feel to be the new Canadian champion?” she asked, a cameraman orbiting them to get the perfect angle. Barry blinked into the camera’s light, his mind a complete blank. He could feel the eyes of his friends, of strangers, of the entire city, it seemed, upon him. He opened his mouth, and what came out was the simple, unvarnished truth. “Uh, mostly it feels a little bloated,” he said, a nervous laugh escaping him. “And tired. But mostly, just… grateful.” He instinctively put his arm around Marge, pulling her into the frame. “I couldn’t have done it without my wife, Marge. She’s the brains of the operation.” Marge blushed, but her smile was radiant. It was the right answer. He was just Barry Kowalski from St. Boniface, a lucky guy with a great wife. That was a persona he could live with.

The ten-minute interview felt like an hour. He answered questions about Taggart (“A real professional”), the final pie (“Felt like I was on home turf”), and his strategy (“Just tried to stay neat”). Finally, with promises of a follow-up story, the media circus subsided. Laden with the Golden Ladle, the novelty cheque, and Mrs. Dubois’s precious pie, they made their way to the parking garage. His Ford Ranger looked endearingly small and battered under the fluorescent lights. The Golden Ladle, when Dave reverently placed it on the dashboard, looked like a hood ornament from a visiting spaceship. The drive home was a blur of familiar streets made strange by the day’s events. The grey, monolithic snowbanks lining the roads, the houses with their warm, yellow lights glowing against the encroaching purple dusk—it was all the same, and yet everything was different. He was the same man driving the same truck down the same streets, but he was also the National Pie Eating Champion. The two identities sat uncomfortably side-by-side in the cab of his truck, unsure of how to speak to one another.

The next morning, the alarm went off at its usual 5:30 a.m., the sound a brutal but welcome return to normalcy. For a blissful, half-conscious moment, Barry was just an electrician who had to get to work. Then he rolled over and the dull ache in his jaw reminded him. He sat up, the protest from his over-stretched stomach a low groan. Marge was already gone, having left early for her own job at the local library, but a fresh pot of coffee was brewed and a single piece of dry toast sat on a plate for him on the counter—a champion’s breakfast. The Golden Ladle sat on the kitchen table, an absurd centerpiece. He stared at it while he drank his coffee, the morning light glinting off its polished surface. It didn’t feel real. It felt like an elaborate prop from a dream he couldn’t quite shake.

He pulled on his insulated coveralls, the stiff, familiar fabric a comfort. The weight of his tool belt as he clipped it around his waist was a grounding force. At the Portage Avenue site, he walked into the trailer bracing himself for more fanfare, but the morning muster was surprisingly subdued. Frank gave him a nod from behind his desk. One of the plumbers passed him a coffee and said, “Way to go, Barry,” with a quiet sincerity that was more meaningful than any cheering. A single, store-bought apple pie sat on the break table with a plastic knife stuck in the middle, a silent, respectful tribute. They had celebrated his return; now it was time to work. The unspoken message was clear: you’re a champion, but you’re also one of us, and the conduits on the third floor aren’t going to run themselves. Barry had never been so happy to see a set of blueprints in his life.

For eight hours, he lost himself in the elegant logic of his trade. He pulled wire, twisted marettes, and mounted junction boxes. The world shrank to the colour-coded strands in his hands—black to brass, white to silver, bare copper to the green screw. It was a world of tangible problems and definitive solutions, a world governed by unyielding laws. Here, chaos could be ordered, and every connection had a purpose. It was the best therapy he could have asked for. He was so engrossed in his work, tracing a complex circuit through a ceiling grid, that he didn't hear Frank walk up behind him until the foreman cleared his throat. “Got a call for you, Kowalski,” Frank said. “Some guy from a radio station in Toronto. Said it was urgent. I told him you were busy bringing light to the world and he’d have to call back after quitting time.” Barry looked at his foreman, a deep sense of gratitude welling up inside him. Frank wasn't just his boss; he was his gatekeeper.

That night, the new reality came knocking in earnest. While Marge made a simple soup and sandwich supper—the very concept of a complex meal was still abhorrent to Barry—Dave showed up, his binder tucked under his arm and his phone pressed to his ear. He paced the small living room, gesturing wildly. “No, Mr. Henderson, a regional tractor supply chain is a bit off-brand for him right now… Yes, I understand the synergy, but we’re thinking bigger… I’ll have to get back to you.” He hung up, his eyes wide with manic glee. “Barry! That was the marketing director for Prairie Pride Tractors! They want you as a celebrity guest for their spring kickoff event! There’s a free tractor in it for you!”

“Dave, I live in St. Boniface. Where am I going to park a tractor?” Barry asked, stirring his soup.

“It’s not about the tractor, it’s about the exposure!” Dave insisted. “And that was just one call! I’ve got three radio morning shows on hold, a guy from a breakfast cereal company wants to talk about a potential endorsement, and a reality TV producer called about a show called ‘Battle of the Bites.’ This is happening, man!”

Barry looked at Marge, who was watching the exchange with an amused, patient expression. The life Dave was describing—a whirlwind of paid appearances, media spots, and branding opportunities—felt as foreign and unappealing as eating another pie. He was an electrician. His idea of a public appearance was telling the new homeowners where the breaker panel was. He looked at the oversized cheque, which they had finally propped up on the mantle. Ten thousand dollars. It was a life-changing amount of money, a solution to so many small, persistent worries. But it felt like it came with strings, and those strings were pulling him toward a life he didn't recognize and wasn’t sure he wanted. His glorious, messy curve was threatening to spiral out of control.The soup, a simple chicken noodle Marge had made from scratch, was a small miracle of warmth and salt, a welcome antidote to the lingering sweetness that seemed to have permanently coated Barry’s tongue. He ate slowly, deliberately, focusing on the familiar comfort of it, trying to create a small pocket of normalcy in his own kitchen. It was a futile effort. On the other side of the room, Dave was a storm of ambition, pacing the length of their small living room with the phone clamped to his ear, a whirlwind of kinetic energy that was sucking all the quiet out of the house. He had traded his “KOWALSKI PIE CREW” polo for a slightly-too-tight button-down, his unofficial uniform as Barry’s self-appointed manager.

“Listen, Todd, I hear you. A lifetime supply of whipped topping is a generous offer, but we’re looking for partnerships with a bit more… substance,” Dave was saying, gesturing with his free hand as if negotiating a multi-million-dollar deal. “We’re building a brand here. The Pie-Man is about authenticity. He’s about the prairie spirit. He’s not just a topping guy.” Dave winked at Barry, who just stared down into his bowl, watching a piece of carrot float aimlessly. A brand. The prairie spirit. He was an electrician from St. Boniface who was good at eating. The distance between those two truths felt vast and impassable.

Marge refilled his glass of water, her movements a study in practiced calm. She caught his eye and gave him a look that said, *Just tune him out. He’ll run out of battery eventually.* But Dave’s battery, Barry was quickly learning, was powered by a fusion reactor of pure, uncut enthusiasm. He finished his call with a flourish—“I’ll have my people circle back to your people, Todd”—and immediately began scrolling through his phone, a rapturous look on his face. “Barry! Did you hear that? The biggest whipped topping company in Western Canada! And the producer from ‘Battle of the Bites’ called back. They want to fly us to Los Angeles for a screen test. They think you have a real ‘everyman relatability’ that will pop on camera!”

The words landed on Barry like drops of acid. Los Angeles. Screen test. Relatability. It was a foreign language describing a life he couldn't even begin to imagine. “Dave, I don’t have a passport,” he said, the first practical objection that came to mind. “And I don’t want to ‘pop’ on camera. I just want to finish my soup.”

“Details, details! We can get a passport rushed!” Dave waved a dismissive hand. “This is the window, Barry! It’s open right now, but it’s not going to stay open forever. We have to climb through it before Taggart announces his comeback tour or some other hotshot eater comes along.” He pulled a folded piece of paper from his back pocket and spread it on the kitchen table, pushing aside the salt and pepper shakers. It was a schedule, meticulously drafted in his blocky print. Every day for the next two weeks was filled. Radio interviews, a photo shoot for the community newspaper, a meeting with a local car dealership, and, circled in red, the Prairie Pride Tractor spring kickoff.

The intrusion of this new reality was relentless. The next day, a Saturday, Marge convinced him they needed groceries. The simple act of walking through the aisles of the Safeway, a mundane ritual he’d performed a thousand times, became a gauntlet. A man in the cereal aisle stopped his cart abruptly. “Hey! I know you! You’re the pie guy! You’re Barry!” he exclaimed, loud enough for half the store to turn and look. Before Barry could respond, the man’s wife was pulling out her phone. “Can we get a picture? My brother-in-law in Saskatoon is not going to believe this.” Barry found himself standing awkwardly between the Cheerios and the Frosted Flakes, a forced smile on his face, his arm automatically going around a complete stranger while his wife took a photo. He felt like a roadside attraction, a curiosity to be captured and shared. As they walked away, he heard the man say to his wife, “He looks shorter in person.”

That night, after a day punctuated by three more such encounters, Barry sat in the worn armchair in his living room, the quiet of the house a blessed relief. The Golden Ladle sat on the mantle, a silent, gleaming accusation. Marge was on the couch, knitting a scarf, the rhythmic click of her needles a soothing counterpoint to the anxious thrumming in his chest. “It’s getting a little weird, isn’t it?” she said, not looking up from her work.

“A little,” he admitted. “People are looking at me differently. Like I’m not just a guy anymore. I’m a thing. I’m ‘The Pie-Man.’”

“Well,” she said, pausing to count her stitches, “in a way, you are. You did something extraordinary. People are excited. It won’t last forever.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” he said, so quietly he wasn’t sure if he’d spoken aloud. “And it’s also what I’m hoping for.”

The breaking point arrived on Tuesday evening. Dave came over, this time with a briefcase he’d bought at a thrift store, and from it, he produced a contract. It was a formal offer from the producers of “Battle of the Bites.” A five-year commitment, a six-figure salary if the show was picked up for a full season, and a demanding travel schedule that would take him across North America to face off against other “food warriors” in contrived eating challenges. It was all there in black and white, a detailed blueprint for a new life. A life where he wouldn’t be an electrician anymore. A life where his home would be a series of hotel rooms and television studios.

Dave laid it on the table with the reverence of a man presenting the Ten Commandments. “This is it, Barry. This is the moment. This is what we were training for. This is the real nationals.”

Barry stared at the thick stack of paper. He saw the dense paragraphs of legalese, the clauses and sub-clauses, the signature line at the bottom waiting for his name. He thought of the clean, simple elegance of an electrical schematic, where every line had a purpose and every connection made sense. This contract was the opposite. It was a tangled, chaotic mess designed to own him. He felt a wave of claustrophobia, a desperate need for air. He stood up from the table, his chair scraping loudly against the linoleum.

“No,” he said. The word was quiet but absolute.

Dave stared at him, his face a mask of confusion. “No? What do you mean, no? Did you see the numbers? Barry, this is generational wealth! You could retire by forty-five!”

“I don’t want to retire by forty-five, Dave,” Barry said, his voice gaining strength as he finally articulated the truth that had been building inside him. “I like my job. I like getting up in the morning and going to a site. I like the smell of sawdust and PVC cement. I like solving problems and making something work. I like coming home at the end of the day, covered in dust, to my wife and my house.” He ran a hand through his hair, his frustration and exhaustion bubbling over. “I’m not an entertainer. I’m not a brand. I’m not ‘The Pie-Man.’ I’m Barry Kowalski. I’m an electrician. That contest… it was a dare. It was for fun. It was a glorious, ridiculous thing that happened. But it’s not my life. This,” he said, gesturing around the small, comfortable kitchen, at Marge who was watching him with a soft, proud smile, “this is my life.”

Dave sank into a chair, the binder and the contract and the five-year plan suddenly looking like the foolish fantasies of a child. He looked genuinely hurt, his coaching dreams deflating before their eyes. “But… I thought… we did it. We won.”

“We did win, Dave,” Marge said gently, stepping forward and placing a hand on his shoulder. “You were the best coach in the world. And Barry was the best eater. And we won. But winning doesn’t mean you have to sell your whole life to the highest bidder.” She picked up the schedule Dave had made and a red pen from the junk drawer by the phone. “Now, let’s look at this. A morning radio show? Barry can do that on his way to work. The Prairie Pride event? That’s on a Saturday. We can go to that. It sounds like fun. The community paper wants a photo? We’ll do it right here, in the living room.” She drew neat red lines through the flights to Calgary, the meeting with the cereal company, and the screen test in Los Angeles. She circled the local events, the things a man could do while still living his life.

She handed the amended schedule to Barry. He looked at it, at the few remaining commitments floating in a sea of crossed-out opportunities. It looked manageable. It looked like something he could do without losing himself. He looked at Dave, whose face was still a picture of crestfallen disappointment. “The tractor thing sounds okay,” Barry said, offering an olive branch. “It’d be good to get out and thank people. And I’ll do the interviews. But that’s it, Dave. No agents. No TV shows. And for the love of God, no branding.”

Dave looked from the contract to the schedule to Barry’s determined face. He let out a long, slow sigh, the last of the hot air leaving his grand ambition. “Okay, champ,” he said, his voice subdued. “Okay. We’ll do it your way.”

Later that night, long after Dave had left with his briefcase full of broken dreams, Barry was in his small, cluttered garage. He stood at his workbench, the air smelling of oil and cold metal. He picked up his wire strippers, the tool’s weight familiar and comforting in his palm. With a practiced flick of his wrist, he stripped the plastic coating from a short piece of 14-gauge wire, revealing the bright, clean copper beneath. He looked at the perfect, straight line of the metal, a stark contrast to the messy curve of a pie. He was both. He could be both. The champion was what he had done. The electrician was who he was. And for the first time since the confetti had fallen, he felt a quiet, profound sense of peace. He was back in control of his own circuit.The first test of Barry’s new, carefully circumscribed celebrity came on a frigid Thursday morning. He was sitting in the cab of his Ranger in the pre-dawn darkness of the job site parking lot, the engine rumbling and the heater fighting its familiar, losing battle. His travel mug of coffee steamed in the cup holder. On the passenger seat, his phone was on speaker, and on the other end, Dave was in full coaching mode.

“Okay, champ, just remember what we talked about,” Dave said, his voice crackling with nervous energy. “High energy. Big laughs. You’re the Pie-Man, the Prairie Powerhouse! When they ask you about the final round, talk about the roar of the crowd, the fire in your belly. Sell the drama!”

“Dave, it’s six-fifteen in the morning. I don’t have fire in my belly, I have half a piece of toast,” Barry sighed, watching the first of the other trades pull into the lot, their headlights cutting through the gloom. “And I’m about to go run conduit for eight hours. The only drama I’m selling is whether this thermal shirt was a poor life choice.”

A moment later, his phone buzzed with the incoming call from the radio station. He took a deep breath and answered. “Hello?”

“He’s here!” a booming voice exploded in his ear. “Live in the cab of his truck, the man who brought the Golden Ladle home to Winnipeg, Barry ‘The Pie-Man’ Kowalski! Barry, welcome to ‘Mornings with Buzz and Fiona’!”

“Uh, hi,” Barry said. “Thanks for having me.”

“So, Barry, take us back!” the host, Buzz, commanded. “The final countdown, you’re neck-and-neck with the legendary Timothy Taggart. What’s going through your mind? Is it just a wall of white noise, or are you thinking about the glory for the folks back home?”

Barry paused, swirling the coffee in his mug. He thought about the question honestly. “Mostly, I was just trying not to throw up,” he said. “And I was worried about the structural integrity of the crust. It was a good bake, very flaky, but that can be a real problem when you’re trying to maintain a rhythm.”

There was a half-second of dead air on the other end. Fiona, the other host, jumped in with a giggle. “Structural integrity! You hear that, Buzz? He’s an engineer of eating! So, Barry, you’re an electrician by trade, right? What do your buddies on the job site think of all this?”

“They’re good about it,” Barry said, feeling himself relax. This was familiar territory. “Mostly they just leave pies on the break table now, which is a bit much, to be honest. But it’s all in good fun. Yesterday, one of the plumbers, Jimmy, asked me if my ‘fold and compress’ technique would work on a burrito. I told him the tortilla-to-filling ratio was all wrong. You’d need a whole different approach.”

He spent the next five minutes talking less about the competition and more about the strange physics of competitive eating, the differences between savoury and sweet pie crusts, and the electrical code violations he’d seen on home renovation shows. He was just Barry, a guy who knew his trade and happened to have a very weird hobby. When the interview was over, he hung up and sat in the quiet of his truck. He hadn’t been the Pie-Man. He’d been an electrician who won a contest. It felt right.

The Prairie Pride Tractor kickoff event that Saturday was an entirely different scale of strange. The dealership was a massive, hangar-like building on the edge of the city, filled with gleaming green and yellow machines the size of small houses. A stage had been set up between a combine harvester and a towering front-end loader, and a surprisingly large crowd of families, farmers, and curiosity-seekers had gathered, eating free hot dogs and kicking the enormous tires of the equipment. Barry, wearing his nicest flannel shirt, stood backstage (a corner sectioned off with velvet rope) with Marge and Dave, feeling deeply and profoundly out of place.

When he was introduced, he walked onto the stage to a wave of warm, genuine applause. He squinted into the lights, mumbled his thanks, and answered a few questions from the dealership’s owner. Then they presented him with a ceremonial, oversized key to a brand-new 9RX Series Tractor, a four-tracked behemoth that retailed for more than his house. Barry held the giant key, utterly dumbfounded.

He cleared his throat and stepped to the microphone. “Wow. Thank you. This is… a lot of tractor,” he said, drawing a laugh from the crowd. “I, uh, I appreciate this more than you know. But my driveway in St. Boniface is about half the size of one of these tires. So, if it’s all the same to you, I was wondering if maybe, instead of the tractor, Prairie Pride might consider making a donation of its value to Harvest Manitoba? They could use it a lot more than I could.”

A hush fell over the crowd, followed by a surge of applause that was louder and more heartfelt than when he’d first walked on stage. The dealership owner, caught completely off-guard but savvy enough to recognize a PR grand slam, immediately agreed, shaking Barry’s hand vigorously. Later, as Barry was signing autographs on napkins and seed caps, an older farmer in a well-worn work jacket approached him. He didn’t ask for an autograph.

“Kowalski, right?” the farmer said, his handshake firm and dry. “Heard you on the radio the other day. You’re an electrician?”

“Yes, sir,” Barry said.

“I’ve got a new grain dryer, and the phase converter keeps tripping the breaker. My guy says I need to run a whole new sub-panel. Sounds like a load of bunk to me. What do you think?”

For the next ten minutes, Barry forgot he was a celebrity. He talked to the farmer about amperage loads, wire gauges, and the merits of a soft-start motor. His hands moved as he spoke, sketching invisible diagrams in the air. He was completely in his element. Marge watched from a few feet away, a small, knowing smile on her face. He had found his balance.

The winnings arrived in their bank account a week later, a number with enough zeroes to feel unreal. The first thing Barry did was call a reputable local company and order a new high-efficiency furnace. Two days later, a pair of technicians were in his basement, dismantling the old, wheezing metal octopus that had been the bane of his winters. Barry watched them work, fascinated, asking questions about their tools and techniques. He understood this process. It was a tangible improvement, a logical upgrade. That evening, when the new furnace kicked in for the first time, it was with a barely-audible, gentle hum. The house filled with a steady, reliable warmth he hadn’t realized they’d been missing.

“Hear that?” Marge said, standing beside him in the living room.

“I don’t hear anything,” Barry said.

“Exactly,” she replied, leaning her head on his shoulder. “It’s the sound of peace of mind.”

That Friday, after a long week of work, Barry came home to find the white bakery box from Mrs. Dubois sitting on the kitchen counter. It had remained there, untouched, a silent testament to his pie-induced trauma. He opened the lid. Inside was a perfect, nine-inch bumbleberry pie. The lattice crust was golden, the filling a deep, inviting purple. He looked at it not as a challenge, not as a training exercise, but simply as a pie. A beautiful pie.

He cut a generous slice, the knife sinking through the crust with a satisfying crackle. He put it on a plate, got a fork, and sat down at his kitchen table. The Golden Ladle was gone, moved to a box in the garage at his request. The oversized cheque had been ceremoniously ripped up after they’d taken a photo of it. He was just a man in his kitchen. He took the first bite. The sharp, sweet burst of raspberry and rhubarb, the mellow undertone of Saskatoon berry. It was a masterpiece. He closed his eyes, savoring the glorious, messy curve. He wasn’t racing. He wasn’t performing. He was just enjoying a piece of pie. And it was the most satisfying victory of all.Spring arrived in Winnipeg not as a gentle awakening, but as a messy, reluctant thaw. The monolithic cliffs of snow that had lined the streets of St. Boniface all winter sagged, turning grey and pock-marked, weeping dirty water into the gutters. The air, no longer a brittle, stinging powder, became a damp, heavy blanket that smelled of wet earth and melting dog dirt. For Barry Kowalski, the change of seasons mirrored the slow receding of his own strange celebrity. The calls from morning radio shows had trickled to a stop. The requests for appearances at hardware store grand openings had ceased. The brief, intense flare of his fame had burned out, leaving behind a comfortable warmth and the quiet hum of his new furnace.

Life settled into a rhythm that was both new and deeply familiar. The ten thousand dollars, after being used for the furnace and a new roof that no longer threatened to leak with every spring shower, had been tucked into a savings account that Marge referred to as the “No More Worries Fund.” Barry went to work every day, losing himself in the clean, logical world of circuits and schematics, his brief tenure as “The Pie-Man” becoming a running joke among the other trades, a story to be told over lukewarm coffee during a mid-morning break. The Golden Ladle, after a month of gathering dust on the mantle, had been carefully wrapped in an old towel and placed in a large plastic bin in the garage, alongside his collection of specialty screwdrivers and a box of his grandmother’s old recipe cards. It had served its purpose.

His weekends reverted to their natural, unhurried pace. He spent Saturdays working on the small, satisfying projects that his old, leaky house always provided. He re-mortared a loose brick on the front step. He meticulously cleaned and organized his workbench in the garage. He and Marge sat at the kitchen table with seed catalogues, planning a small vegetable garden for the backyard, arguing amicably over the merits of heirloom tomatoes versus hardy beefsteaks. Dave, having accepted the collapse of his sports management empire with a surprising amount of grace, had redirected his ferocious energy into managing a fantasy hockey league, and his calls were now filled with frantic trade proposals instead of branding strategies. The glorious, messy curve of Barry’s adventure had smoothed out, integrating itself seamlessly back into the straight lines of his life.

He was in the garage on a Saturday afternoon in late April, methodically sharpening the blades of his lawnmower for the season ahead, when he heard the front door open and Marge’s voice, followed by a deeper, unfamiliar one. He wiped the grease from his hands with a rag, assuming it was one of the neighbours or a kid selling fundraiser chocolates. He walked into the house through the kitchen, and stopped dead in the doorway to the living room. Marge was standing there, her arms crossed, her expression a mixture of protective suspicion and utter disbelief. And standing awkwardly just inside the front door, looking profoundly out of place beside their coat rack, was Timothy “The Tsunami” Taggart.

He was not the fearsome eating machine Barry remembered from the competition stage. Gone was the black tracksuit and the aura of coiled, predatory energy. He was just a man in his late twenties, dressed in jeans and a nondescript grey windbreaker, his lean frame looking slighter without the backdrop of television lights and a roaring crowd. He held a small, generic-looking rental car key in his hand, fidgeting with it nervously. He looked less like a world-class athlete and more like a university student who had shown up at the wrong address for a study group. When his pale blue eyes met Barry’s, they held not the cool dismissal of their first encounter, but an unsettling, raw uncertainty.

“Kowalski,” Taggart said, his voice quiet, lacking the public bravado. “Sorry to just… show up. I was in town. I got your address from the internet. It wasn’t hard to find.”

The statement hung in the air, a plain fact that felt like a low-grade threat. Marge’s posture stiffened. “What do you want?” she asked, her tone flat and unwelcoming. She had positioned herself between Taggart and the rest of the house, a one-woman security detail.

Barry, his mind struggling to bridge the gap between the memory of the confetti-filled stage and the reality of this man standing on his doormat, found his voice. “It’s okay, Mar,” he said, stepping into the room. He looked at Taggart, his curiosity overriding his alarm. “You were in town? In Winnipeg? What for?”

“For this,” Taggart said, gesturing vaguely between the two of them. He took a hesitant step into the living room, his eyes scanning the space—the comfortable, slightly worn armchair, the bookshelf overflowing with Marge’s paperbacks, the photos on the mantle. It was the look of a man trying to solve a complex puzzle. “I haven’t been able to train properly since the nationals,” he said, the admission seemingly costing him a great deal. “My numbers are down. My rhythm is off. I keep thinking about that final round.”

He stopped in the middle of the room, turning to face Barry directly. “You broke my system. I watched the tape a hundred times. The way you dealt with the meringue. The way you broke down the lattice on the bumbleberry. It wasn’t just technique. I can learn any technique. I’ve tried. But what you did… it was different. You weren’t fighting the pie. You were… I don’t know… reasoning with it.” The word sounded absurd, but Taggart said it with dead seriousness. “I came here because I need to understand.”

A heavy silence filled the small living room. Dave’s frantic fantasies of a rivalry and a rematch had been just that—fantasies. This was something stranger, more complicated. This was a defeated champion, a man whose entire identity was built on a system of cold, hard efficiency, coming to the home of the man who had beaten him, not with a better system, but with no system at all. This was a crisis of faith.

“Understand what?” Barry asked, genuinely confused.

Taggart’s gaze was intense, almost pleading. “What you know that I don’t. It’s not about speed. It’s not about capacity. I have more of both. But you won.” He took a deep breath, steeling himself for his final, desperate proposition. “I don’t want a rematch. Not for a title. I want you to show me. I want to sit down at a table with you, right here, and eat a piece of pie. No cameras, no crowds, no stopwatches. I just… I need to see how you do it. I need you to teach me how to respect the pie.”The request was so utterly bizarre, so far outside the logical parameters of Barry’s world, that for a long moment, no one spoke. The only sound in the small living room was the gentle hum of the new furnace and the frantic ticking of the cuckoo clock on the wall, a wedding gift that had never once told the correct time. Marge, her arms still crossed in a posture of maternal defiance, was the first to break the silence. Her voice was quiet but held the unyielding temper of hardened steel.

“No,” she said. It was not a suggestion or a point of negotiation. It was a closed and locked door. “With all due respect, Mr. Taggart, this isn’t a training facility. This is our home. My husband isn’t a guru or a pie-eating sensei. He’s an electrician who won a contest, and that part of his life is over. We’re not interested in whatever… crisis you’re having.”

Taggart flinched, not as if he’d been struck, but as if a critical piece of data he’d been expecting had failed to materialize. He looked at Barry, his pale eyes searching for a different answer. “Kowalski,” he began, his voice strained. “I’m not asking for trade secrets. I’ll pay you for your time. I just—”

“He drove all the way from Toronto, Mar,” Barry interrupted gently, his gaze fixed on Taggart. He saw past the unnerving champion and saw what was actually standing in his living room: a lost kid. A young man whose entire world, a world built on a foundation of absolute certainty and quantifiable success, had been fractured by a twelve-gram anomaly. Barry didn’t feel threatened; he felt a strange, uncomfortable pang of empathy. It was like seeing a beautifully calibrated and expensive piece of equipment that had mysteriously gone on the fritz. His first instinct wasn't to throw it out, but to pop the cover and see what was wrong with the wiring. “He’s not asking for a fight. He’s asking for… help.”

“He’s asking to disrupt the peace we just fought to get back,” Marge countered, her voice low and fierce, meant for Barry alone. “This is how it starts again. First, it’s one piece of pie at the kitchen table. Then it’s a ‘friendly’ rematch in the garage. Then Dave is back with his briefcase and we’re right back where we started. I won’t let that happen, Barry.”

She was right, of course. Her logic was flawless, a perfectly grounded circuit. And yet, Barry couldn’t shake the image of Taggart’s face in the moment after the final bell—the sheer, uncomprehending shock of a machine that had encountered a result it could not compute. He looked from his wife’s protective, loving face to Taggart’s lost, desperate one. He was a man caught between two opposing currents.

“One piece of pie,” Barry said, his voice taking on a tone of quiet finality. He wasn’t asking Marge for permission, but stating a fact. “At the kitchen table. No stopwatches, no coaching.” He looked directly at Taggart. “Then you get in your car and you drive away, and you don’t come back. You get one lesson. That’s the deal.” Taggart nodded eagerly, a drowning man grabbing for a lifeline. Marge held Barry’s gaze for a long moment, her disapproval clear, but she saw the resolve in his eyes. With a sigh that carried the weight of the world, she uncrossed her arms. The door, it seemed, had been unlocked.

Without another word, Barry turned and walked into the kitchen. Taggart followed him like a nervous apprentice, hovering uncertainly in the doorway as Barry went to the counter and opened the white bakery box from Mrs. Dubois. The bumbleberry pie sat inside, a pristine circle of comfort and memory. He took out two plates from the cupboard, the everyday stoneware plates they used for supper, and two forks. Marge moved silently into the kitchen behind them, her presence a silent, watchful chaperone. She put a pot of water on to boil for tea, her movements sharp and efficient, a clear sign that while she was allowing this to happen, she was not endorsing it.

Barry placed the pie on the wooden cutting board in the center of the table. He picked up a knife, its blade clean and sharp. Taggart leaned forward slightly, his eyes narrowed in concentration, as if he were watching a surgeon prepare for a complex operation. But Barry’s movements were not clinical. He didn’t assess the pie for structural weaknesses or optimal entry points. He simply looked at it, appreciating the perfect browning of the lattice crust and the way the dark filling had just begun to bubble through the gaps. He thought of Mrs. Dubois, her hands perpetually dusted with flour.

“My Grandma Elsie,” Barry said, his voice filling the quiet kitchen, “she was the one who taught me about pie. She used to say that you don’t eat a good pie, you visit with it. She said you could taste the baker’s whole day in the crust. If they were rushed, it’d be tough. If they were happy, it’d be light as air.” He slid the knife into the pie, the sound a gentle, satisfying crunch. He cut a generous slice, the kind you’d serve a guest you wanted to feel welcome, and placed it on a plate. Then he cut a second, identical slice. He slid one plate across the table to Taggart.

“There’s no technique,” Barry said, sitting down. “There’s no system. You just… start.”

Taggart stared at the slice of pie in front of him. It was a chaotic landscape of fruit and pastry, the purple filling oozing slightly onto the white plate. He picked up his fork, holding it not like an eating utensil, but like a weapon he was unfamiliar with. He watched as Barry took his first bite. There was no rush, no compression, no tactical sip of water. Barry simply closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, a flicker of pure, unadulterated pleasure crossing his face. Taggart hesitantly copied the motion, cutting a small, precise, analytical bite. He put it in his mouth and began to chew, his jaw moving with a mechanical rhythm, his eyes darting around as if trying to locate an invisible opponent.

“You’re not tasting it,” Barry observed quietly. “You’re processing it. You’re trying to figure out how to beat it.”

Taggart stopped chewing, the fork hovering over his plate. “How else do you do it?”

“You stop thinking about yourself,” Barry said simply. He took another bite, savouring the sharp tang of the rhubarb. “You stop thinking about winning or losing or how fast you’re going. You think about the person who made it. You think about the fruit, where it came from. These Saskatoon berries, they taste like a prairie summer. The rhubarb, it’s got that bite that wakes you up. They don’t go together logically, but they work. It’s a mess. A beautiful mess. You can’t beat it. You just have to accept it. You have to let it win.”

Let it win. The concept was so alien to Taggart’s hyper-competitive mind that he actually blinked. He looked down at his plate. He took another bite, but this time, he did it differently. He closed his eyes. He forced himself to slow down, to stop the relentless clock that was always ticking in the back of his mind. He focused on the texture, the contrast between the flaky, buttery crust and the soft, warm fruit. He tasted the sharp burst of raspberry, then the deeper, mellower note of the Saskatoon berry. For the first time, he wasn't consuming fuel for a victory; he was experiencing a flavour. It was inefficient. It was illogical. And it was, in a way he couldn’t articulate, revelatory.

They finished their slices in a strange, shared silence. Marge poured three mugs of tea and set them on the table, her movements a little softer now. The crisis had passed. When they were done, Taggart carefully placed his fork on his empty plate. He looked at the plate, then at Barry, and a slow, dawning comprehension illuminated his pale eyes.

“So,” Taggart said, his voice barely a whisper. “The secret isn’t in the eating.”

“No,” Barry replied, taking a sip of his tea. “The secret is in the pie.”

Taggart stood up, pushing his chair back quietly. He looked around the small, warm kitchen—at the magnets holding school pictures of nieces and nephews to the refrigerator, at the worn spot on the linoleum in front of the sink, at the quiet woman sipping her tea, at the ordinary man who had shown him something extraordinary. He finally understood. Barry’s strength didn’t come from a hidden technique or a secret training regimen. It came from all of this. It came from a life lived outside the arena.

“Thank you, Kowalski,” he said, the words formal but imbued with a new, genuine respect. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet, but Barry held up a hand.

“The lesson’s free,” Barry said. “But it was just the one.”

Taggart nodded, understanding. He walked to the front door, with Barry and Marge following. On the doorstep, he turned one last time. “For what it’s worth,” he said, looking at Barry, “you’re a hell of an electrician.” And with that, he turned, walked down the path to his rental car, and drove away, disappearing back into the world of straight lines and quantifiable results, but leaving as a slightly different machine than the one that had arrived. Barry stood at the door for a long moment, watching the taillights fade down his quiet street, before closing it and turning the lock. He was alone with his wife in his house, the lingering scent of warm bumbleberry pie filling the peaceful air.The silence that followed Ms. Carmichael’s offer was a heavy, weighted thing, thick with the phantom scent of baking sugar and the dizzying calculus of large numbers. Barry stood frozen in his own kitchen, the phone receiver slick with sweat in his hand. Through the line, he could hear the faint, ambient hum of a distant, important office, a world of spreadsheets and marketing strategies that had just collided with his quiet life of flannel shirts and wire nuts. He looked at Marge. Her face was a canvas of conflicting emotions: the shock of the numbers, the worry of what it all meant, and beneath it all, the steady, unwavering belief that he would make the right choice, whatever that was.

“Ms. Carmichael,” he said, his voice strained, “that’s… a very generous offer. I’m going to need to talk it over with my wife.”

“Of course, Barry,” she replied, her voice smooth as silk, sensing her hook was set. “Take the evening. But I will need an answer by noon tomorrow. We have press releases to draft. The story is already starting to write itself.” She gave him a direct number and disconnected, leaving a dial tone buzzing in his ear like a swarm of anxious bees. He slowly hung up the phone, the plastic click echoing loudly in the quiet house.

“A five-star hotel?” Marge breathed, her eyes wide. “Barry, the last time we stayed in a hotel, it had a coin-operated vibrating bed.”

He leaned back against the counter, feeling the solid edge of the laminate press into his back. “Twenty thousand dollars,” he said, the number tasting strange in his mouth. “Plus the five grand. That’s more than I make in six months of climbing ladders and crawling through dusty attics.” He looked around their cozy kitchen, at the worn but beloved wooden table, the slightly-askew cupboard door he kept meaning to fix. Everything in this room, in this house, had been earned through that honest, dusty work. The money Ms. Carmichael was offering felt like it was from another planet, unearned and dangerously seductive.

“It’s lottery money,” Marge said, her practical mind already working, dissecting the offer. “It’s a temptation wrapped in a solution. She’s not offering you money, Barry. She’s offering to buy your story. The one we just got back.” She came and stood in front of him, taking his hands in hers. They were calloused and ingrained with the day’s work, a stark contrast to the slick, corporate world that had just come calling. “So, what do you want to do?”

That was the question, stripped of all the zeroes and the promises of legendary status. What did he, Barry Kowalski, actually want? The first win had been a dare, a joke that had spiraled into a surreal triumph. It had fixed their roof and bought them peace of mind. He had nothing left to prove to Dave, to his friends, or to himself. The idea of returning to that stage, of putting his body through that peculiar, sugary hell again, filled him with a deep, physical reluctance. But this was different. This wasn’t about glory. It was about Marge’s rusty Civic. It was about his aging parents and the unspoken worries about their retirement. It was a clear, tangible way to build a higher wall of security around the life he loved so much. Could he endure the chaos for one more weekend to secure a decade of peace?

“I hate it,” he said honestly, his voice low. “I hate the idea of being that person again, the ‘Pie-Man’ on a stage. I hate the cameras and the pressure. But I’d be a fool to not think about what that money could do for us, for our family.” He squeezed her hands. “I don’t know what to do, Mar. For the first time, I really don’t know.”

They talked late into the night, sitting at the kitchen table where he had shared a slice of pie with his greatest rival. They made lists of pros and cons on the back of a grocery store flyer. The ‘con’ list was long and emotional: the stress, the disruption, the physical toll, the risk of losing the quiet life they’d reclaimed. The ‘pro’ list was short and brutally pragmatic. It just had a number on it: $25,000. They talked about what they would do if they said no. Life would go on, comfortable and good. They didn’t need the money to be happy. They talked about what they would do if they said yes. The stress would be immense, but temporary. And the security it would buy would be permanent.

Around midnight, Marge stood up and put the kettle on again. “You know,” she said, her back to him as she measured tea leaves into a pot. “Last time, you were worried about Timothy Taggart. You were afraid you couldn’t be him. And you were right. You won because you were you.” She turned to face him, her expression clear and resolved. “This time, you’re afraid of being the ‘Pie-Man.’ You’re afraid of what Ms. Carmichael and her marketing department will turn you into. But you’re not their story to write, Barry. You never were. If you do this, you do it our way. No agents, no tractor shows, no ‘Battle of the Bites.’ One weekend. We fly in, you eat the pies, we collect the cheque, and we come home. We are in charge. Not them.”

Her words cut through the fog of his anxiety. She wasn’t telling him what to do, but she was showing him how it could be done. She was drawing a circuit diagram for him, showing him how to contain the dangerous current, how to install a breaker so it wouldn’t overload the system of their life. He looked at her, his partner, his grounding wire, and he felt a surge of love and clarity.

The next morning, at precisely 8:00 a.m., Barry called Ms. Carmichael. “Ms. Carmichael, Barry Kowalski. I’ve thought about your offer.”

“Barry! Wonderful to hear from you. I trust you’ve made the wise decision,” she said, her voice radiating confident charm.

“I’ll do it,” Barry said. “On a few conditions.”

There was a slight pause. “Conditions?”

“Yes. First, my participation is for this one event only. There will be no further commitments, no media tours, no talk of ‘being the face of the sport.’ I am defending my title, and that’s it. Second, my friend Dave is not my manager or agent, he is my guest, and any and all communication from your organization is to come directly to me or my wife. Third, and this is non-negotiable, we will not be staying at the five-star hotel. You can book us into the same no-frills motel near the airport we stayed in last year. We like it there.”

Another, longer pause stretched down the line. Barry could almost hear the gears turning in her head, the calculations being re-run. He was disrupting her narrative, refusing to play the part of the grateful, wide-eyed underdog. “Mr. Kowalski,” she said, her voice having lost a fraction of its silken polish, “that’s… highly unorthodox.”

“That’s the deal,” Barry said, his voice firm. He had learned from Marge. This was not a negotiation. He was setting the terms.

He heard her let out a quiet, frustrated sigh. “Very well, Barry. The deal is the deal. We’ll have our people wire the contracts to you for your review. Welcome back to the big leagues.”

As he hung up the phone, Barry felt a strange sense of calm. The dread was still there, a low hum in the background, but it was overshadowed by a feeling of control. Marge had been right. He wasn’t their story. He was his own. He was just a man making a pragmatic, difficult decision for his family. He walked to the garage, the cold concrete floor chilling the soles of his socks. He went to the large plastic bin in the corner and lifted the lid. He unwrapped the old towel, and the Golden Ladle gleamed dully in the dim light. He picked it up, its weight a familiar, unwelcome burden. He wasn’t a champion defending his crown. He was an electrician taking on one last, difficult, but very well-paid job. And he would see it through.The weeks leading up to the rematch did not have the frantic, amateur energy of a dare escalating out of control. There was no whiteboard in the living room, no binder filled with fever-dream strategies. The preparation this time was a quiet, methodical, and deeply joyless affair. It felt less like training and more like studying for a professional licensing exam that you had to pass but desperately wished you didn’t have to take. It was a job, and Barry approached it with the grim determination of a man facing a month of mandatory, unpaid overtime.

Marge became the project manager, a role she assumed with unnerving efficiency. She drew up a calendar on the fridge, marking off the days until the competition. Three nights a week were designated as “practice sessions.” There were no celebratory trips to the bakery on Academy Road. Instead, Marge would stop at a different grocery store on her way home from the library, returning with a rotating selection of their most generic, mass-produced pies. They were tools, not treats, chosen for their uniform density and predictable crust-to-filling ratios. They were the bland, standardized opposition he would face in the early rounds, and he treated them with a cold, analytical detachment.

Dave, demoted from his role as head coach and manager, settled into a new position as Barry’s official timekeeper and data analyst. He arrived on the first night of training, his binder looking thinner and less ostentatious, a chastened energy about him. As Barry sat down to a shrink-wrapped cherry pie, Dave started to slip into his old rhythms. “Okay, champ, remember the cherry. It’s all about managing the slickness of the filling. We want a high-velocity, low-chew approach. Use the dunk—”

“Dave,” Barry cut him off, his voice quiet but firm. He didn’t look up from the pie. “I need you to do two things. Time each pie from first bite to last swallow. And make a note of the crust’s structural failure point. That’s it.” The message was clear. Dave was a valuable member of the team, but he was no longer the strategist. Barry was the electrician, and he would be designing his own system this time. Dave, after a moment of deflated silence, clicked his stopwatch and nodded. “Right. Timing and failure points. Got it, chief.”

The phone started ringing. Ms. Carmichael’s marketing machine, though constrained by Barry’s conditions, was still a powerful engine. Local newspapers wanted to do a follow-up piece. A morning talk show from Calgary wanted to fly him out for an in-studio interview. A company that manufactured novelty aprons wanted to send him a free lifetime supply. Marge fielded every call with the polite, impenetrable stonewalling of a seasoned corporate receptionist. “Barry is focusing on his preparations and is not available for comment,” she would say, her voice smooth and pleasant. “Thank you so much for your interest.” Then she would hang up and add another hash mark to a running tally she kept on a sticky note by the phone under the heading “Distractions Dealt With.”

The work was a brutal grind. Without the novelty and the thrill of the unknown, the sheer physical act of consuming that much pastry and sugar was a form of self-inflicted punishment. One evening, midway through a particularly dense and cloying pumpkin pie, Barry hit a wall. The spices, which should have been warm and comforting, tasted like chalk dust. His jaw ached with a deep, pulsating throb. His stomach, already protesting, sent a clear and urgent signal that it was at capacity. He pushed the half-eaten pie away, the fork clattering onto the plate. “I’m done,” he said, slumping back in his chair. “I can’t. This is stupid.”

Marge, who had been quietly paying bills at the other end of the table, didn’t offer a pep talk. She didn’t tell him he was a champion or that the city was counting on him. She simply stood up, walked to the refrigerator, and took down a photograph held there by a magnet shaped like a smiling slice of toast. It was a picture of her ten-year-old Civic, its paint faded and a new spiderweb of rust blooming over the rear wheel well. She placed it on the table next to his plate. “That car sounds like it’s grinding rocks every time I put it in reverse, Barry,” she said, her voice devoid of sentiment. “The mechanic said the transmission is on its last legs. This is two weeks of feeling sick so we can have ten years of not worrying about being stranded on the side of the road in February.”

He stared at the picture of the ailing car. Her logic was irrefutable, a perfect, unassailable truth. It wasn’t about glory. It was about the transmission. It was about the mortgage. It was about their life. With a heavy, resigned sigh, he picked up his fork, pulled the plate of pumpkin pie back towards him, and got back to work.

His mental preparation was just as rigorous. He spent hours online, but not watching his own highlights or Taggart’s old victories. He was looking for something else. He was looking for any sign of how his opponent was preparing for their rematch. He found it, not on a slick sports network website, but buried deep in an obscure, text-only competitive eating forum, a digital back alley where the true obsessives gathered. It was a long, anonymous post titled “Rethinking the System: A Post-Defeat Manifesto.” The author wrote about the limitations of a purely mechanical approach, the diminishing returns of speed without strategy. He wrote about studying the “medium” and not just the “method.” He described a new, hybrid training regimen that incorporated elements of speed-eating with something he called “structural deconstruction” and “sensory mapping.” The post was analytical, brilliant, and utterly terrifying. Barry knew, with a certainty that settled like a stone in his gut, that Timothy Taggart had written it. The lost kid who had shown up at his door was gone. The champion had taken Barry’s one free lesson, fed it into his own high-performance operating system, and created something new. Taggart wasn’t just coming to defend his old style; he was coming with a new one, a hybrid system born from his own machine-like efficiency and Barry’s intuitive, messy art. The Tsunami hadn’t receded; it had pulled back to gather strength, and it was about to come ashore with terrifying new force. Barry closed the laptop, the quiet hum of his new furnace suddenly feeling very small against the roar of the coming storm.The second journey to Toronto was a study in grim purpose. The nervous, wide-eyed wonder of the previous year had been replaced by a heavy, professional silence. They flew on a Tuesday evening to give Barry two days to acclimate, a recommendation from an article Marge had read about minimizing the effects of jet lag on athletic performance. Barry spent the entire flight staring out the window at the endless blanket of clouds, his mind a quiet, churning sea of anxiety and strategy. He wasn’t thinking about the glory; he was thinking about angles of attack, about crust density, about the terrifying, evolved opponent he had helped to create. Marge, seated beside him, didn’t offer platitudes or encouragement. She read a dog-eared copy of a consumer report on the most reliable sedans under twenty thousand dollars, her focus as narrow and intense as his own. In the aisle seat, Dave fidgeted with his phone, scrolling through sports betting odds that now listed Barry as a significant underdog, a fact he wisely chose not to share. This was not an adventure. It was a deployment.

Their arrival at the “no-frills” motel near the airport was a quiet homecoming to a place they had no affection for. The beige room was identical to the one from the year before, a sterile, anonymous box designed for transient sleep. But this time, it felt less like a compromise and more like a tactical choice. It was a bunker, stripped of all distractions. A crisp email from Ms. Carmichael’s office, waiting in Marge’s inbox, confirmed their mandatory attendance at a press conference the following afternoon. It also noted, with a hint of passive aggression, that their request for “standard accommodations” had been honored, though “upgraded suites at the Royal York remained at their disposal.” Marge deleted the email without comment. They were here on their terms, and every small act of refusing the offered luxury was a reinforcement of that control.

The press conference was held in a sleek, glass-walled ballroom downtown, a place that smelled of money and recycled air. The media presence was double that of the previous year. The narrative of the humble underdog had been replaced by the far more compelling story of the legendary rematch: The Tsunami’s Revenge. Ms. Carmichael, acting as the masterful ringmaster of her own circus, played up the drama, introducing Barry not just as the champion, a title which still felt awkward and ill-fitting, but as “the man who did the impossible.” Barry walked to the podium, the flash of cameras a familiar but no less jarring assault. He squinted into the bright lights, his face a mask of practiced neutrality.

He was a terrible interview, and it was entirely on purpose. To questions about his training regimen, he said, “I’ve been practicing.” To questions about the pressure of defending his title, he said, “I’m focused on the task at hand.” To a question from a blogger about whether he still “respected the pie,” he gave a one-word answer: “Yes.” He was a tradesman discussing a job. He was boring. He was professional. He was refusing to give them the folksy, heartwarming character they so desperately wanted. He could feel Ms. Carmichael’s polished smile tightening at the edge of the stage. He was ruining her story.

Then, Timothy Taggart was introduced. The change in him was palpable. The lost, uncertain young man who had stood in Barry’s kitchen was gone, replaced by a figure of immense and unsettling serenity. He walked to the stage with the same economy of motion, but it was no longer the cold, mechanical efficiency of a predator. It was the calm, centered grace of a martial artist who had achieved a new level of mastery. He took the microphone and smiled, a small, confident smile that reached his pale blue eyes.

“It’s an honor to be back,” Taggart began, his voice even and articulate. “Last year, I experienced a critical system failure. My methodology was exposed as having a singular, glaring weakness: it was rigid. It failed to account for the unique variables of the medium.” He looked out over the crowd of reporters, but Barry knew the words were aimed directly at him. “This past year has been a period of intense redevelopment. I’ve learned that true mastery isn’t about imposing a system onto the challenge. It’s about synthesizing philosophies. It’s about integrating the mechanical with the intuitive. It is, as my esteemed competitor taught me, about respecting the pie.” He finished his remarks and a wave of impressed murmurs went through the room. He had taken Barry’s simple, heartfelt philosophy and weaponized it, turning it into a bullet point in his new, terrifyingly holistic approach.

As Taggart stepped down from the podium, his path intersected with Barry’s. He stopped for a moment, the cameras flashing around them, capturing the face-off. He extended a hand. Barry, feeling he had no choice, shook it. Taggart’s grip was dry and firm. “Kowalski,” he said, his voice a low murmur for Barry’s ears only. “Thank you for the consultation last spring. Your lesson was very instructive. I’ve made some significant upgrades to the system.” He gave a single, sharp nod, the gesture of a man who was absolutely certain of the outcome, and walked away, leaving Barry standing alone in the glare of the lights, the full weight of his mistake settling upon him. He hadn’t just beaten Taggart last year. He had taught him. He had given his most dangerous opponent the one piece of code he was missing.

That night, the beige motel room was a pressure cooker of unspoken tension. Dave, poring over the video of the press conference on his laptop, kept shaking his head. “Did you hear that? ‘Synthesizing philosophies.’ He sounds like a tech billionaire, not a guy who eats for a living. What did you say to him, Barry?” Barry didn’t answer. He was methodically laying out his competition-day clothes—the same flannel shirt, the same jeans. A uniform for a job. Marge sat on the edge of the bed, a book open in her lap, though her eyes hadn’t moved from the same page in twenty minutes. The silence was thick with what they all now knew: Taggart wasn’t just back. He was better. He had evolved.

Later, when Dave was asleep and the room was dark save for the sliver of light from the bathroom, Barry lay on his back, staring at the textured ceiling. He felt Marge shift in the bed beside him. “You’re thinking too loud again,” she whispered into the darkness.

“He’s going to kill me, Mar,” Barry whispered back, the admission a painful release. “He took my one advantage, the one thing that made me different, and he made it part of his arsenal. I helped him build the machine that’s going to beat me.”

She was quiet for a long moment. He felt her hand find his in the darkness between their beds. Her grip was sure. “Then he’s not a machine anymore, is he?” she said, her voice a thread of steel. “He’s just another guy who thinks he’s figured it all out. And you’ve got a rusty Civic and a brand-new roof to pay for. So, let me ask you something, Mr. Electrician. When you come up against a perfectly designed circuit, something brand new and state-of-the-art, what do you do?”

Barry thought about it, the question pulling his mind back to the familiar, logical world he understood. “You look for the flaw,” he said. “There’s always a flaw. A weak connection, a vulnerability to a power surge, something the designer got too clever about and overlooked.”

“Exactly,” Marge said, squeezing his hand. “He thinks he’s perfect now. He thinks he’s synthesized everything. But perfection is brittle, Barry. Your strength was never about respecting the pie. It was about knowing that things can be messy and chaotic and still work. He learned your lesson, but he doesn’t understand it. Not like you do. So tomorrow, you stop worrying about his new system. You just go out there and be the glorious, messy curve. And you find the flaw.”The morning of the championship arrived not with a jolt, but with a quiet, gray Toronto dawn that seeped through the motel room’s thin curtains. There was no alarm. Barry was already awake, having slept in short, fitful bursts. He lay on his back, the texture of the ceiling a familiar, uninteresting landscape, and listened to the steady breathing of his wife beside him. The dread was gone, burned away by the heat of a new, cold purpose. Marge’s words from the night before had rewired his entire approach. He was no longer a defender bracing for an assault. He was a diagnostician walking onto a job site, armed with a multimeter and a healthy dose of professional skepticism, ready to troubleshoot a complex and dangerously overpowered piece of machinery. The competition wasn’t a fight; it was a diagnostic test.

The pre-competition rituals were performed in a near-silent pantomime. Dave, his face etched with a sleepless anxiety that he was trying and failing to conceal, meticulously laid out three bottles of room-temperature water and a pack of chewing gum, a new addition to the regimen intended to pre-emptively combat jaw fatigue. Marge made a pot of the murky motel coffee and handed Barry a mug, her eyes asking a question he couldn’t yet answer. He gave her a small, tight nod, a signal that the electrician was on the clock. He did not eat. His stomach was a coiled spring, and he needed it empty, primed, and ready for the load it was about to bear. He dressed in his flannel shirt and jeans, the familiar textures a kind of armor. As he laced up his work boots, he felt a strange calm settle over him. He was no longer afraid of Taggart’s system. He was just intensely curious about how it was going to fail.

The convention centre was a maelstrom of manufactured excitement. The crowd was immense, a sold-out sea of faces buzzing with the anticipation of a heavyweight title fight. The National Eats Network had a full broadcast crew on site, their cameras on cranes sweeping over the audience like birds of prey. The narrative was everywhere, plastered on oversized screens and intoned by the booming voice of the host: The Rematch. The Redemption. The Return of the King. Barry walked through it all as if encased in a bubble of profound silence. He saw the signs in the crowd, the majority bearing Taggart’s name or likeness. He saw his own scattered supporters, a small but hardy contingent, including a man in a homemade “Prairie Power” t-shirt. He found Marge and Dave in their designated seats near the front, a small island of unwavering loyalty in a sea of opposition. Marge simply met his gaze and mouthed the words, “Find the flaw.”

Backstage, in the tense, Gatorade-scented air of the competitors’ area, the atmosphere was thick with nervous energy. The other eaters gave Barry a wide berth, their expressions a mixture of respect for the reigning champion and the shared certainty that he was about to be dethroned. Barry ignored them. His focus was entirely on one man. Timothy Taggart stood alone in a corner, performing a series of slow, deliberate stretches, his movements as fluid and controlled as a ballet dancer’s. He was a picture of absolute, almost transcendent calm. As Barry watched, he saw Taggart’s eyes briefly close, his chest rising and falling in a slow, meditative breath. He wasn’t just preparing his body; he was optimizing his internal processor, clearing his cache for the immense data stream to come. When he opened his eyes, they swept the room and landed on Barry, holding his gaze for a long, unblinking moment. There was no animosity in the look, no intimidation. It was the pure, cold acknowledgement of an opponent, a final pre-flight systems check. Barry simply nodded back, the gesture of one professional to another, and turned his attention to the stage.

The first round was a gauntlet of ten six-inch apple pies, a classic test of speed and endurance. The pies were uniform, perfectly round, their lattice crusts a testament to industrial baking precision. They were the standardized components of the diagnostic test. The starting bell shrieked, and the stage exploded into a flurry of motion. Barry picked up his first pie and fell into his rhythm, the familiar, methodical process of deconstruction. But his eyes, and a crucial part of his focus, were on Taggart, three stations down. The Tsunami’s new system was a thing of terrifying beauty. It was a fluid, unbroken sequence of motion. He didn’t just eat; he flowed. He used a fork in one hand to breach the crust and scoop the filling while his other hand folded and compressed a previously separated piece of pastry, all in perfect synchrony with his rhythmic, metronomic water sips. It was the ‘chipmunk’ technique fused with Barry’s ‘structural deconstruction,’ elevated to an art form. It was devastatingly effective.

Taggart finished his first pie in twenty-eight seconds. His second in twenty-seven. He was a relentless, self-correcting algorithm of consumption. The crowd roared with every empty tin he slammed down on the table. Barry, by contrast, was a full ten seconds slower per pie, his movements deliberate, his pace steady but human. He ignored the groans from the audience as he fell further and further behind. He wasn’t racing Taggart’s ghost. He was watching the machine, looking for the tell. He observed Taggart’s hands, the flawless coordination. He watched his jaw, the piston-like efficiency. He watched his water sips, timed to the millisecond. For nine and a half minutes, the system was perfect, a beautiful, terrifying spectacle of human potential pushed to its absolute limit. Taggart finished all ten pies with nearly forty-five seconds to spare, a new record. He calmly wiped his mouth and stood back from the table, a serene conqueror. Barry, meanwhile, managed to finish his ninth pie just as the final bell rang, leaving one untouched. He had been lapped. He had been utterly, comprehensively dominated.

As he walked off the stage, a wave of disappointment washed through the crowd. The great rematch was looking like a rout. Dave rushed to his side, his face pale. “He’s a monster, Barry! He’s not human! His pace never wavered! What are we going to do?” Barry just took the bottle of water Marge offered him, his mind replaying every frame of Taggart’s performance. He had made it through to the next round, but the result of the first heat was a foregone conclusion. Taggart was simply in another league. Marge looked at him, her face calm and steady amidst the noise. “Did you see it?” she asked, her voice low. Barry took a long pull from the water bottle, his eyes distant. He nodded slowly. “I think so,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “It was just a flicker. On pie number seven.” He had seen it. A tiny, almost imperceptible hesitation. The lattice on the seventh pie had been slightly thicker on one side, a minor baking inconsistency. Taggart’s fork, expecting a certain level of resistance, had met a fraction more. For a single, fleeting moment, his perfect, fluid motion had hitched. His hands had gone momentarily out of sync, a microscopic stutter in the system before it corrected and resumed its flawless rhythm. It was nothing. A casual observer would never have seen it. But Barry, the electrician, had seen it. It was a flicker in the lights, a momentary voltage drop in a perfect circuit. And he knew, with the certainty of a man who had spent his life tracing faults, that if you could replicate the conditions, a flicker could become a full-blown power failure. He finally had his diagnosis. Now, he just needed the right kind of pie.The time between the first round and the final was a vacuum of sound and motion. On the giant screens suspended above the stage, the broadcast replayed highlights of Taggart’s flawless, record-breaking performance, the commentators weaving a narrative of historic dominance. The crowd buzzed with the certainty of a foregone conclusion. For them, the only remaining question was the margin of Taggart’s inevitable victory. Backstage, the other eliminated competitors were already packing their bags, their faces a mixture of awe at Taggart’s skill and relief that they were not the ones being led to the slaughter. In the midst of it all, Barry sat on a folding chair, a towel draped over his head, shutting out the world. He wasn’t listening to the noise. He was listening to the memory of a single, tiny stutter in a perfect machine.

“His system is flawless, Barry,” Dave whispered, pacing frantically in a small circle in front of him. “I ran the numbers. His pace deviation was less than half a second per pie. It’s statistically perfect. There’s no way to beat that. We can’t beat that.” Marge stood behind Dave, a silent pillar of calm. She placed a firm hand on Dave’s shoulder, stopping his frantic pacing. She looked at the towel-shrouded form of her husband, her expression unwavering. She knew he wasn't defeated. He was working.

The host’s voice, slick with manufactured drama, boomed through the hall, signaling the start of the final. Barry stood up, letting the towel fall from his shoulders. He walked toward the stage, his steps steady and deliberate, the gait of a man heading to a job he knew how to do. He took his place at the table, the lights hot on his face, the roar of the crowd a distant, irrelevant hum. The stagehands brought out the final pies, placing them before the two finalists. The host leaned into his microphone, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush.

“And for the final, a true test of adaptability and grit! Not a uniform, factory-made creation, but a pie that embodies the spirit of the challenger’s home turf. Ladies and gentlemen, a twelve-inch, deep-dish, Rustic Prairie Strawberry-Rhubarb Crumble!”

A murmur went through the crowd as they looked at the pies on the screens. They were not elegant. They were not neat. Instead of a perfect lattice, the tops were a chaotic, uneven jumble of oats, brown sugar, and butter, browned to different degrees, with angry red rivers of cooked fruit bubbling up through the gaps. They were beautiful, but they were a mess. They were masterpieces of deliberate inconsistency. Barry looked at the pie in front of him, and for the first time that day, the corner of his mouth twitched into a small, almost imperceptible smile. The perfect storm he had been hoping for had just been served on a platter.

Taggart, across the table, assessed the pie with a cool, analytical gaze. He saw the chaos, the inconsistency, but his face registered no concern. His new, synthesized system was designed for this. He had mapped the variables. He was ready. He gave Barry a final, confident nod, the look of a man who has already run every possible simulation and won them all. The great bell rang, a sharp, clarion call that ripped through the tension, and the final battle began.

Taggart moved with the blinding speed he had displayed in the first round. His system was a marvel, adapting to the crumble top with terrifying grace. His fork broke through the crust, his other hand prepared the next bite, his water sips were perfectly timed. He was a force of nature, a hurricane of controlled consumption, tearing through the pie with breathtaking efficiency. The crowd roared its approval, chanting his name. “TSU-NA-MI! TSU-NA-MI!” Barry, in stark contrast, was shockingly still. He did not take a bite. For a full five seconds, he simply looked at his pie. Then, he picked up his fork and did something no one expected. He didn’t eat. He began to work. With a series of quick, deliberate motions, he plunged his fork deep into the pie, not to lift a piece to his mouth, but to stir. He churned the soft, wet filling into the crunchy, dry crumble, turning the already chaotic pie into a uniform, unpredictable slurry. He was not deconstructing the pie; he was corrupting it, turning it into a textural minefield.

After fifteen seconds of this deliberate sabotage, he took his first bite. It was a slow, measured mouthful. He chewed, swallowed, and took a sip of water. His pace was glacial compared to the whirlwind of activity at Taggart’s station. But he wasn’t trying to keep pace. He was laying a trap. Taggart, deep in his optimized flow state, was now more than a quarter of the way through his pie. He was moving with such speed that he wasn’t tasting or feeling individual bites; he was processing a continuous stream of data his brain had already mapped. But the data was starting to change. He scooped a large mouthful, his system anticipating the soft fruit and crunchy topping he’d encountered so far. Instead, he got a dense, unexpected pocket of dry, floury crumble that Barry had churned up from the bottom crust, a textural curveball his system hadn’t simulated.

The flicker happened. It was more pronounced this time, a visible hitch in his perfect rhythm. His jaw, expecting to compress soft fruit, had to work harder on the dry pastry. The motion went out of sync with his water sip by a fraction of a second. He had to cough, a small, choked sound, before recovering. A flicker of pure, unadulterated frustration crossed his face. He shot a venomous glare at Barry, who simply continued his slow, methodical work, turning his own pie into an even more chaotic mess before taking another calm, measured bite. Taggart, incensed by the disruption, made a fatal error. He tried to compensate for the lost second by increasing his speed, by forcing his system to power through the corrupted data. He began eating with a renewed, angry ferocity, abandoning the serene grace for brute force.

This was the flaw. It wasn’t in the system; it was in the man. The perfectionist could not tolerate imperfection. The master of control could not handle chaos. Taggart’s beautiful, synthesized philosophy collapsed under the weight of a single, frustrating mouthful. His movements became ragged. He encountered another unpredictable pocket of texture and had to spit a small, half-chewed piece of crust onto his plate to keep from choking. It was a rookie mistake, a cardinal sin in the world of competitive eating, born of pure rage. The crowd, sensing the shift in dynamics, grew quieter. The rhythmic chant of “Tsunami” died out, replaced by a confused murmur. Barry, meanwhile, never broke his pace. He was a slow, steady demolition crew, dismantling his pie with the same unhurried rhythm he’d started with. He was hopelessly behind in terms of sheer volume, but he was in complete and utter control.

The final minute was a portrait in contrasts. Taggart was a Tasmanian devil of fury, his face and station a Jackson Pollock of red filling and brown crumble. He was ramming food into his mouth, his technique dissolving into raw, primal gluttony. He was winning the race but losing the war. Barry was a stonemason, patient and precise, his station remarkably clean, his movements economical. He was going to lose the battle of the scales, but he was executing his job flawlessly. The host, watching the bizarre scene unfold, was at a loss for words, his prepared narrative of a triumphant coronation in tatters.

The final bell shrieked its merciful conclusion. Taggart threw his fork down with a clatter of pure disgust and slumped in his chair, breathing heavily, his face a mask of thunderous rage. He had eaten more, visibly more, perhaps three-quarters of his pie. Barry, who had consumed just over half of his, calmly placed his fork on his clean plate and took a final, steadying sip of water. He leaned back in his chair, not with the triumphant air of a champion, but with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman whose complex, unorthodox repair had held up under pressure. The crowd was silent, utterly baffled. Taggart was the apparent winner, but he looked like he had lost. Barry was the apparent loser, but he looked like he had just executed his plan to perfection.

The judges, their faces grim and unreadable, descended upon the two stations. They carried their scales and their clipboards, preparing to render a verdict on the most bizarre final the sport had ever seen. The cameras zoomed in, first on Taggart’s plate, a cratered, messy battlefield littered with the collateral damage of his fury, then on Barry’s, which was emptier than Taggart’s but clean, a model of professional tidiness. The entire hall held its breath. The fate of the championship, the twenty-five thousand dollars, and the very definition of victory now rested in their hands.
