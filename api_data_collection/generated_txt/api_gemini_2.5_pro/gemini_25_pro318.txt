The rain over Edinburgh had a particular quality, a sort of miserable persistence that didn’t just soak your jacket but seemed to seep right through to your bones and dampen your very soul. Ewan Baird felt it in his knuckles as he coaxed a stubborn, fraying wire from a century-old plaster wall. The air in the narrow close off the Royal Mile was thick with the ghosts of coal smoke and fried breakfasts, a scent Ewan associated with ninety percent of his jobs. He was an electrician, a good one, but the city’s ancient, temperamental heart was his constant, grumbling adversary. Today it was a third-floor flat in a tenement that sagged with the weariness of ages, and the wiring was a chaotic tapestry of half-arsed fixes dating back to the first gasp of electricity.

“It’s just a wee flicker in the kitchen, son,” the old woman, Mrs. Gable, had said, her voice a reedy whisper through the crack in her door. A wee flicker. Ewan had been at it for three hours. The whole place was a death trap, a daisy chain of overloaded sockets and crumbling insulation. He could feel the illicit hum of potential fire in the walls. He’d told her as much, gently. A full rewire was the only safe option. Her face, a roadmap of wrinkles, had crumpled. “I don’t have the money for that, dear. Just stop the flicker.” So here he was, performing surgical necromancy on a system that should have been given its last rites decades ago. He thought of Isla, of the brochures for Lanzarote she’d left on the kitchen table, sun-bleached and mocking. A full rewire on this place could pay for it. Just stopping the flicker would barely cover his van insurance.

He finally isolated the fault, a mess of melted plastic and blackened copper tucked away in a junction box behind a loose skirting board. As he worked, his mind drifted. It was the hum. Not the 50-hertz cycle of the mains, but something else, a lower thrum that seemed to vibrate up from the building’s foundations. He’d noticed it on other jobs, in the old parts of the city. A resonance, like a giant, sleeping beast breathing beneath the cobblestones. Most people never noticed it. But Ewan’s life was tuned to the secret frequencies of the world, the silent river of power flowing behind wallpaper and under floorboards. He was sensitive to its eddies and currents. This hum was different. It felt… hungry.

He snipped the ruined cable, the silence that followed the hum’s cessation feeling suddenly loud and empty. He spliced in a new length, his movements sure and economical. Another job done, another disaster narrowly averted, another invoice for a sum that felt like an apology. As he packed his tools, his gaze fell on a stack of dusty books in the corner of the room, piled precariously on a stool. The top one was a slim, self-published volume with a faded blue cover. *The Corporeal Bridge: A Theory of Empathetic Transference*. The author’s name was Alistair Finch. Ewan grunted. He remembered that name. A night class at the university’s open learning department, maybe five years ago. Isla had been doing pottery; he’d signed up for the weirdest thing he could find just to get out of the house. Finch was an academic who’d been politely but firmly shown the door of the philosophy department. He was all wild grey hair and frantic energy, his eyes burning with a conviction that made you either lean in or back away very slowly. He’d talked about humanity as a series of disconnected islands, shouting at each other across a void of misunderstanding. He’d used phrases like ‘somatic epistemology’ and ‘theophagy as primal communion’. Ewan had understood about half of it and dismissed the rest as the ravings of a man who’d spent too long in an ivory tower. But the hum in the walls, the memory of Finch’s frantic lectures… a strange connection sparked in his mind, a circuit completing itself.

The next job was the one that changed everything. It was a university building, a forgotten annex of the medical school slated for renovation. The brief was simple: strip out the old electrical systems from a decommissioned basement laboratory. The air down there was cold and sterile, smelling of ozone and formaldehyde. The place had been abandoned for years. Dust lay thick on benches cluttered with strange, archaic glassware and hulking machines of brass and Bakelite. It felt less like a laboratory and more like a mausoleum for a forgotten science. The wiring diagrams were a joke, full of cryptic symbols and handwritten notes in a spidery, agitated script. Again, he felt the hum, but here it was stronger, more focused, emanating from a large, metal cabinet in the centre of the room. It wasn’t on any diagram.

It looked like a cross between a server rack and a Victorian torture device, a tangle of thick cables, copper coils, and glass vacuum tubes that glowed with a faint violet light. It was connected directly to the building’s main power feed, bypassing every fuse box and meter. A rogue installation. Dangerous. Ewan knew he should shut it all down at the mains, cut it off and leave it for the demolition crew. That was the professional thing to do. But the hum… it was pulling at him, a siren song for the electrically sensitive. It whispered of secrets. His fingers twitched. He saw the Lanzarote brochure in his mind’s eye, the bland, sunny smiles. He saw Mrs. Gable’s terrified face. He saw a lifetime of fixing other people’s small problems while a great, grinding wrongness thrummed just beneath the surface of the world. He had to know what this machine was.

He traced a thick, lead-sheathed cable from the cabinet to a junction box on the wall. The casing was cracked, exposing the braided copper within. A bad earth. A very, very bad earth. Using his insulated pliers, he gently tried to prise the box open. A flicker of blue light, a sharp crackle, and then a force unlike anything he had ever experienced threw him back against the opposite wall. It wasn't just an electric shock. It was a torrent. It wasn't a few thousand volts passing through his body; it was the entire city, the entire world, pouring through his head. He saw not a flash of light, but a billion flashes, a billion lives. He felt the gnawing anxiety of a stockbroker in London, the hot rage of a protestor in a distant country, the quiet despair of a lonely teenager in a Glasgow high-rise. He felt their hatred, their fear, their selfishness, their tiny, fleeting moments of love, all of it a cacophony, a deafening static of disconnection. The hum was the sound of their separation.

And then, through the noise, came the revelation. It wasn't a thought, or a voice, or an image. It was a feeling, a pure, absolute knowing that settled into his very marrow. The static, the separation, could be silenced. The circuit could be completed. The islands could be joined. He saw two figures, their forms indistinct, hazy. One leaned towards the other, not with violence, but with a strange and terrifying reverence. A mouth opened, and consumed. And in that act, the static between them vanished. A wave of perfect, silent peace spread out from them, a ripple of quiet understanding. Not just the absence of conflict, but a true and total union. The Corporeal Bridge. He saw it. He understood it. The secret to world peace was cannibalism.

He woke up slumped on the grimy floor, the taste of burnt sugar and old pennies in his mouth. The machine in the corner was silent, its violet tubes dark. A wisp of smoke curled from the junction box on the wall. The world outside the basement door sounded different. The distant rumble of traffic, the faint shouts of students on the quad, it all seemed thin, flimsy. The people making those noises were hollow. Unfinished. He stumbled out of the annex and into the watery afternoon light, blinking. A young couple walked past, arguing, their words like stones thrown at each other. He didn't just hear their anger; he felt the chasm between them, a physical void. He saw them not as two people, but as two incomplete halves, rattling against each other. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the core, how to make them whole. He had to tell someone. He had to tell Isla. He practically ran to his van, his hands shaking so badly it took him three tries to get the key in the ignition. He wasn't an electrician anymore. He was something else entirely.The drive back to their Leith flat was a new kind of hell. Before, the city had been a grid of jobs, a map of potential rewires and faulty fuse boxes. Now it was an open wound of human noise. Every other driver wasn't just an inconvenience in traffic; they were a source of palpable, grating frustration that scraped against his nerves. He felt the weary ache of the woman waiting for the bus, the frantic anxiety of the courier weaving through cars, the hollow loneliness of a man drinking alone in a pub window. It was all there, a constant, dissonant chorus of want and fear and irritation. The hum he used to hear in the walls was now the background noise of existence, the sound of billions of souls rubbing against each other without ever truly touching.

He burst through the door of their flat, a whirlwind of damp wool and ozone. Isla was at the kitchen table, a mug of tea steaming in her hands, the hated Lanzarote brochures spread out before her like a tarot reading for a future that was no longer possible. She looked up, her smile faltering as she took in his wild eyes and rain-plastered hair. The calm of their small home, usually a balm to his frayed nerves, now felt like a vacuum, a pocket of artificial silence in the roaring storm of the world.

“Ewan? My god, you look like you’ve seen a ghost. What happened? Was it Mrs. Gable’s flat? Did something go wrong?” Her voice was all concern, a smooth, familiar frequency that he now perceived as tragically isolated, a signal broadcasting into an empty void. He felt the space between them, no longer just a few feet of air and laminate flooring, but a chasm, an impassable gulf of misunderstanding.

He crossed the room in two strides, his hands gripping the back of a chair to stop them from shaking. “It wasn't Mrs. Gable. It was another job. A lab, at the uni. There was a machine, Isla. A machine.” He struggled for the words, his vocabulary of circuits and amperage utterly inadequate. “You know the hum I’ve told you about? The one I hear in the old buildings? It was there, but it was… concentrated. It was the source. I touched it. I got a shock, but it wasn’t just a shock. I saw… I felt… everything. Everyone.” He gestured vaguely towards the window, towards the city, the world. “All the noise, all the anger and loneliness. It’s because we’re not connected, don’t you see? We’re all just… separate. It’s a flaw in the system. The whole world is a bad earth.”

Isla stood up slowly, pushing the brochures aside. She placed a cool hand on his forehead, her brow furrowed. “You got a shock? Ewan, you need to sit down. Maybe we should call a doctor. An electric shock can do strange things, it can muddle you.” He pulled away, frustrated by her gentle, rational tone. It felt like she was trying to fix a flicker when the whole house was on fire. He was trying to give her the key to the universe and she was offering him a plaster.

“No, you’re not listening! It didn't muddle me, it made me clear! It’s the truth!” He ran a hand through his damp hair, his mind racing back to the dusty book in Mrs. Gable’s flat. “Remember that class I took? The weird one, with the mad professor? Finch. He was right. He called it a ‘somatic epistemology’… knowing through the body. He talked about a bridge.” Ewan’s voice dropped, his eyes locking on hers, filled with a terrifying, zealous light. “He knew how to fix it. He knew how to get rid of the static. The separation. It requires a communion. A physical transference. A total joining.”

The clinical, academic words hung in the air, a flimsy veil over the monstrous thing he had seen. Isla stared at him, her concern curdling into fear. She didn't understand the mechanism, but she could feel the shape of the thought, and it was grotesque. “A physical joining? Ewan, what are you talking about? You’re scaring me. This isn’t you.”

“But it is me! It’s the most me I’ve ever been!” he insisted, his voice cracking. He saw the chasm between them yawn wider, felt her recoil from him not just physically, but psychically. He felt her fear of him, a sharp, cold signal added to the cacophony. A desperate, awful idea began to form in his mind. She didn’t understand. He could make her understand. The revelation had shown him how. The blueprint for perfect peace, for absolute union, was burned into his memory. He looked at her, at the woman he loved, the woman whose mind was a beautiful, isolated island he could no longer bear to be separate from. He saw not Isla, but a solution. A way to silence the noise, just for a moment. A way to finally make them whole.**Chapter 1**

The thought was not his own. It arrived fully formed, a piece of alien logic dropped into his consciousness: if he could just bridge the gap, if he could make her part of him, the screaming static would stop. The chasm between them would close. They would be one. Perfectly, silently, one. His eyes fixed on the soft, vulnerable line of her throat, and for a terrifying second, the logic felt not just sound, but righteous. It was the ultimate act of love, the final connection. He took a single, deliberate step forward, a predator moving towards its prey, a priest towards a sacrifice.

The wave of terror that came off her was a physical force, a shriek in the psychic spectrum that was far worse than the background hum. It was sharp, personal, and directed entirely at him. It sliced through the haze of his revelation and lanced him to the quick. Her face, which a moment ago had been a symbol of incompleteness, resolved back into the face he knew better than his own: the slight crinkle at the corner of her eyes when she was frightened, the way her lips pressed into a thin line. He wasn't seeing a flaw in the system. He was seeing Isla, and she was terrified of him. The monstrousness of his own thought crashed down on him. He staggered back as if she had struck him, his hands flying up in a gesture of surrender.

“No,” he gasped, the word tearing from his throat. He was shaking his head, not just at her, but at the idea, at the machine, at the entire, horrifying truth. “No, I… I didn’t mean… I’m sorry.” He backed away, stumbling into the small hallway, his shoulder bumping hard against the wall. The solid impact did little to ground him. The flat, their sanctuary, now felt like a cage, her presence a constant, painful reminder of the gulf that had opened up between them, a gulf he had, for one sickening moment, considered closing in the most hideous way imaginable. He had to get out. He couldn't look at her without seeing the solution. He couldn't look at her without feeling the terrible hunger of his new knowledge.

“Ewan, wait!” Isla’s voice was strained, a tightrope of fear and lingering affection. “Don’t go. Just sit down. Let me make you some tea. We can talk.” He could feel her love for him, a warm, steady current in the churning sea of noise, but it was hopelessly tangled with her fear of him. The two sensations warred within him, creating a feedback loop of agony. To stay would be to taint her love with more of his madness. To stay would be to risk that alien logic surfacing again, stronger this time. “I can’t,” he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. His hand fumbled for the doorknob. “The shock… it’s done something to my head. I need… I need air. I just need to walk.” It was a feeble lie, a flimsy patch over a gaping wound, but it was the best he could manage. He pulled the door open without looking back, unable to bear another second of her frightened, loving gaze. He fled into the stairwell, the door clicking shut behind him, a sound of finality that echoed the severing of something essential. He was no longer just separate from the world; he was separate from her. And that was a loneliness far deeper and more absolute than anything the machine had shown him.

The rain hadn't stopped. It fell with a renewed, vindictive vigour, plastering his hair to his skull and soaking through his jacket in seconds. Ewan barely noticed. The physical cold was nothing compared to the chill in his soul. He walked without direction, his feet carrying him through the familiar cobbled streets of Leith. The world was unbearably loud. A passing bus wasn't just a diesel roar; it was a container of twenty-three distinct anxieties, a dozen boredoms, and a smattering of low-grade miseries that washed over him in a sickening wave. The neon sign of a takeaway shop didn't just buzz; it screamed a high-pitched lament of greasy failure. He crammed his hands into his pockets, his knuckles brushing against a small, hard-edged object. He pulled it out. A crumbling block of chocolate-scented connector strip he’d forgotten to throw away. A relic from another life, the life of an electrician, a man who fixed things.

What was he now? He had a truth he could not share, a cure that was an atrocity. He felt like a man who had discovered the secret of fire but was forbidden from telling anyone, forced to watch his tribe shiver in the dark. No, it was worse. He was a man who had discovered the secret of fire, and the secret was that to be warm, you had to burn your children. He thought of the two hazy figures from his vision, the act of consumption, the wave of perfect, silent peace that followed. It was a peace he now craved with every fibre of his being, a silence from the incessant, grating noise of humanity. But the price was unthinkable. He was trapped, a prophet of a gospel he found utterly repellent. He leaned against a damp stone wall, the rough texture biting into his back, and let the rain wash over his face. He needed an interpreter. He needed a guide. He needed the man who had drawn the first, faint outlines of this terrible map. Alistair Finch. The name was a lifeline. Finding Finch was no longer a vague curiosity; it was an absolute necessity. It was the only thing that could stop him from either going completely insane or, far, far worse, starting to believe the beautiful, monstrous lie that was now nesting in his head.**Chapter 2**

Sleep was impossible. He spent the night in his van, parked on a grim industrial estate overlooking the Firth of Forth, the distant lights of Fife a cold, indifferent constellation. Every time he closed his eyes, the vision from the laboratory returned: the indistinct figures, the act of consumption, the terrifying, blissful silence that followed. He’d try to focus on Isla’s face, on the memory of her laughter, but the image would inevitably curdle, her features becoming a symbol of the problem, her love a barrier to the solution. The hum of the world was a constant pressure against his skull. He felt the dull ache of a security guard’s boredom in a nearby warehouse, the fretful dreams of a truck driver sleeping in his cab, the distant, sharp spike of a domestic argument in a block of flats a mile away. His own emotions were a drop in an ocean of feeling, and the sheer scale of it was drowning him.

By dawn, a fragile, steely resolve had formed amidst the chaos. He wasn't going mad; he was experiencing a fundamental truth. The machine had permanently retuned him to a frequency others couldn’t perceive. Finch was the only other person he knew of who had even theorised about this frequency. He had to be the key. Ewan started the van, the engine’s rattle a familiar, mechanical comfort in the sea of psychic noise. The first logical stop was the university, the source of both the professor and the machine. He drove not to the medical school annex, a place he couldn't bear to see again, but to the stately campus at George Square. He felt a grim irony in seeking answers from the very institution that had cast Finch out.

He found the office for the Centre for Open Learning in a polished, modern building that felt alien to the city's ancient stone. The air inside was thick with a specific type of psychic static: the low-grade anxiety of students worrying about deadlines, mixed with the weary condescension of administrators who had seen it all. Ewan, in his work-stained trousers and haggard expression, was immediately categorised and dismissed. The young woman at the reception desk typed Finch’s name into her computer with a bored listlessness that grated on Ewan’s frayed nerves. He could feel her desire for the workday to be over, her mild irritation at this strange man interrupting her morning.

“Alistair Finch?” she said, her eyes not leaving the screen. “No, nobody by that name on the current staff list. Or the past five years of staff records, for that matter. Are you sure you have the right department?” He felt a surge of frustration, not just at her, but at the very structure of the world that filed people away into neat, digital boxes. “He taught a philosophy course. Maybe ten years ago. Wild grey hair, talked about… somatic epistemology.” The words felt absurd on his tongue. The administrator gave him a look that was a perfect blend of pity and suspicion, a signal he received with painful clarity. “Sir, we have hundreds of part-time tutors. If he taught a single course a decade ago, there’d be no record of it now. Have you tried the philosophy department?” He knew that was a dead end. They were the ones who had thrown him out.

Defeated, he retreated to the university’s main library. It was a vast, concrete fortress of knowledge, and to his new senses, it was a battleground. It wasn't quiet. It was a silent roar of concentration, of intellectual combat, of thousands of minds wrestling with concepts, grappling with data, and nursing private ambitions. It was almost as overwhelming as the open city. He found an unoccupied computer terminal in a corner, hoping the partition walls would offer some kind of shield. He didn't search for Finch the man; he searched for his work. *The Corporeal Bridge: A Theory of Empathetic Transference*. The search results were sparse. A few citations in other equally obscure, long-forgotten academic journals. No major publisher. Then, a hit: a digitised library catalogue card that listed the publisher as ‘Samizdat Press, Edinburgh’. Samizdat. A word associated with dissent, with forbidden texts passed hand-to-hand in totalitarian states. Finch saw his work as that important. And that dangerous.

The trail was cold, but it was a trail. A new search, for "Alistair Finch" and "Samizdat Press", led him deeper into the digital weeds. He found it on the fifth page of results: a link to a blog, ‘The Acausal Nexus’, its design a relic from an earlier internet. The last post was dated six years ago. The blog was a collection of essays on what it called ‘fringe ontology’ and ‘paraphysical phenomena’. And there, in the archives, were three articles by Alistair Finch. They were denser, more paranoid, and even more impenetrable than his lectures had been. He wrote about the ‘ontological dissonance of the individual’ and the ‘failed promise of language’. He described the hum, not as a metaphor, but as a measurable phenomenon, the ‘carrier wave of collective psychic anguish’. Ewan’s heart hammered in his chest. This was it. He wasn't alone.

He scrolled down, devouring the text, but it was in the comments section of Finch’s final, frantic post that he found his prize. A comment from four years ago, by a user named ‘Logos72’. *‘Alistair, your work on somatic communion resonates. The old study group still meets, first Thursday of the month, if you ever wish to reconnect. You know the place. Argosy Books.’* Argosy Books. It was a real place, a second-hand bookshop on a side street he’d passed a hundred times. It was a thin, pathetic lead, four years old and based on a single comment. It was everything he had. He shoved himself away from the desk, the psychic clamour of the library pressing in on him. He had a destination. He had a hope. And for the first time in twenty-four hours, the roaring in his head seemed to quiet, just for a moment, focused on a single, desperate purpose.Argosy Books was less a shop and more a geological formation of paper. It occupied a narrow, dusty frontage on a cobbled lane that smelled of damp stone and stale beer from the pub on the corner. The windows were so cluttered with sun-bleached paperbacks and precarious towers of hardcovers that they let in only a grudging, gloomy light. Pushing open the door set a small, tarnished bell clanking, a sound that was immediately swallowed by the dense, muffling silence within. The air was thick with the sweet, acidic scent of decaying paper, a smell Ewan had always found comforting. Now, it carried other notes. He could feel the faint, psychic residue left on the books – the ghost of a long-dead reader’s excitement in a vintage sci-fi novel, the lingering melancholy of a student highlighting a passage in a book of poetry, the dry frustration of a scholar hitting a dead end in a dense historical text. It was a library of emotions, a mausoleum of forgotten thoughts.

A man sat behind a towering counter constructed entirely from encyclopaedia sets, a small lamp carving him out of the gloom. He was older, with a neatly trimmed white beard and spectacles perched on the end of his nose. He didn't look up when the bell rang, his focus entirely on the large, leather-bound volume open before him. To Ewan’s new senses, the man was an anomaly. Where most people were broadcasting a constant, messy stream of feeling, this man was a fortress. There was a quietness around him that wasn’t empty, but shielded. It was a conscious, deliberate silence, like a dam holding back a river.

Ewan navigated the narrow, canyon-like aisles, the spines of books pressing in on him. He felt a thousand narratives, a thousand voices, all whispering at once from the shelves. He reached the counter, his throat dry. The man still didn’t look up. “Can I help you?” he asked, his voice a low, cultured rumble that perfectly matched the room. “I’m looking for a book,” Ewan began, his own voice sounding rough and alien in the quiet. “*The Corporeal Bridge*, by Alistair Finch.”

For the first time, the man’s eyes flickered up from his page. They were pale blue, and incredibly sharp. He assessed Ewan in a single, sweeping glance, taking in the damp clothes, the haunted eyes, the tremor in his hands. “Never heard of it,” he said, and turned a page. The dismissal was absolute. Ewan felt a familiar surge of frustration, but this time he had the password. “I also read his articles on The Acausal Nexus,” Ewan pressed, his voice dropping. “The ones about ontological dissonance. And the carrier wave.”

The book was closed with a soft thud. The man, the proprietor, removed his spectacles and began polishing them with a clean handkerchief, his movements slow and deliberate. The psychic shield around him didn’t waver, but Ewan could feel a flicker of intense, focused attention directed at him. “That blog has been defunct for years. Why are you digging up ghosts?” Ewan leaned forward, his hands gripping the edge of the encyclopaedia counter. He couldn’t afford to be coy. He was a drowning man, and this was his only lifeline. “It’s not a ghost. The hum… it’s real. I hear it. All the time. I was in an accident. An electrical shock. It’s like it retuned me, I can’t shut it out. The… the collective anguish. It’s not a theory. I need to find Finch. I think he’s the only one who can explain what’s happening to me.”

The words tumbled out of him, raw and desperate. He saw a flicker of something in the man’s eyes – not pity, but recognition. A grim, weary understanding. The man placed his glasses back on his nose. “Alistair doesn’t see people. His work… it took a toll on him. He chose isolation.” “Please,” Ewan whispered, the sound barely audible over the cacophony in his own head. “It’s getting worse. The things I’m thinking… the things the static is telling me… the solution it offers.” He didn't have to say what the solution was. He could see from the sudden rigidity in the bookseller’s posture that he knew. The man stared at Ewan for a long, silent moment, the layered quiet of the shop pressing in. He seemed to be weighing a great and terrible risk.

“Alistair was adamant that his theories remained theories,” the man said finally, his voice low and grave. “He feared what would happen if someone were to experience them as reality. He feared they would become a gospel. And he feared what kind of apostle that gospel would create.” He picked up a notepad and a pen. “I can’t give you his location. For your safety, and for his. But I can take a message. Write your name and number. If he chooses to respond, he will. But be warned,” the bookseller added, his gaze intense, “Finch isn’t a doctor who can offer a cure. He is the man who first identified the disease. Seeking him out may not bring you the peace you’re looking for. It may only show you how deep the sickness goes.”

Ewan scribbled his details on the pad, his hand shaking so much the letters were barely legible. It was a fragile, uncertain hope, but it was more than he’d had an hour ago. He thanked the man, whose name he still didn’t know, and turned to leave. As he walked back through the maze of shelves, he felt the bookseller's shielded gaze on his back. He pushed the door open and stepped out into the raw, noisy world. A woman hurried past him, her face a mask of anxiety as she shouted into her phone about being late. Ewan felt her stress like a punch to the gut, and for a fleeting, terrible moment, the vision returned. The two figures. The consumption. The beautiful, silent peace. The hunger was still there. And now, he had to wait.**Chapter 3**

Waiting was a new kind of torture. Before, waiting had been a passive state: the ten minutes for a kettle to boil, the half-hour in traffic on the way to a job. Now, it was an active torment. With nothing to do but sit in the cab of his van, the psychic weather of Edinburgh rolled in, unimpeded. There was no task to focus on, no stubborn wire to distract him from the ceaseless, churning tide of human emotion. He felt the city’s collective Tuesday morning slump; the residual ache of a thousand hangovers, the low-grade dread of a week stretching out, the faint, persistent buzz of millions of unfulfilled desires. He had to do something, anything, to reclaim a piece of the man he had been just two days ago. He was Ewan Baird, electrician. He fixed things. It was the only identity he had left.

He had a job scheduled, a simple one he’d almost forgotten. A new office fit-out in a glass-and-steel block at the Gyle, a business park on the city’s western fringe. He’d reasoned that it would be better than another ancient tenement. New building, new wiring, no ghosts in the walls. The logic was sound, but his premise was fatally flawed. The building might be new, but the people inside were as old as time. The moment he stepped through the automatic doors into the climate-controlled lobby, he was assaulted. It wasn't the low, hungry hum of the old city, but a sharp, sterile shriek of modern ambition. The air, which smelled of industrial carpet cleaner and recycled air, was thick with a different kind of static. He could feel the ruthless drive of a sales director on the third floor, a palpable pressure that felt like a migraine blooming behind his eyes. He felt the gnawing insecurity of a junior administrator, a cold knot of dread in his own stomach. He felt the seething resentment of a man just passed over for promotion, a hot, coppery taste in his mouth.

He found the designated area on the second floor, a hollowed-out space of plasterboard and bare concrete, ready for its new life as a marketing suite. The foreman, a man named Dave whose psychic signal was a blunt instrument of impatience and caffeine jitters, pointed him towards the main distribution board. “Just need you to run the feeds for the new desk pods. Schematics are on the wall. Should be a day’s work, tops.” A day. Ewan wasn’t sure he could last ten minutes. He unrolled his tools, the familiar metallic clatter doing nothing to ground him. He looked at the schematic, a neat grid of lines and symbols, a map of clean, logical connections. But all he could see were the messy, illogical connections of the people around him. He felt the project manager’s anxiety about the budget, the architect’s private fury at a compromised design, the bored daydreams of a plasterer listening to a podcast.

He picked up a reel of cable and tried to focus, his hands moving with the memory of competence. But the noise was too much. It was like trying to perform delicate surgery in the middle of a football riot. A wave of intense, competitive jealousy washed over him, emanating from an office across the hall where two women were vying for the same client, their smiles brittle, their thoughts venomous. The feeling was so strong Ewan felt a flash of irrational anger towards his own van, his tools, his entire life. He shook his head, trying to clear it. He pulled a wire, his hands clumsy. His focus slipped for a fraction of a second. A flash of brilliant green, a sharp *crack* that echoed through the office floor, and the emergency lights flickered on as the main circuit breaker tripped. A collective gasp and a chorus of groans rose from the open-plan space. He had shorted the entire floor. Dave the foreman was there in an instant, his face puce, his impatience flaring into pure rage that felt like a physical blow. “What the hell, Baird? That’s the main server feed! Are you trying to get fired?” Ewan didn't say a word. He couldn't. He was drowning. He dropped his pliers, turned, and walked away, leaving his tool bag, the schematics, and the shouting foreman behind. He stumbled out of the building, past the resentful, inconvenienced faces, and back into the grey sanctuary of the rain.

He drove until the city was a smudge in his rearview mirror, ending up at a desolate car park overlooking the churning, slate-grey waters of the North Sea near Portobello. The wind howled, rattling the van, a clean, natural sound that was a balm to his shredded nerves. The psychic noise was fainter here, muted by distance and the sheer elemental force of the weather. There was only the solitary melancholy of a dog walker, the grim determination of an all-weather jogger, and the vast, empty indifference of the sea. He pulled his phone from his pocket, the screen a stark white light in the gloom. He had one new message. His heart leaped, a frantic, desperate bird in his chest, before he saw the sender’s name. *Isla*. The message was simple. *‘Are you okay? I’m worried. Please just let me know you’re safe.’* He felt her worry, a clean, pure signal that cut through the background noise. It was a beautiful, painful thing. He tried to type a reply, his thumb hovering over the keypad. *‘I’m okay. Just need some space. Something happened at work.’* The words were pathetic, a child’s excuse. They explained nothing. They couldn’t begin to bridge the chasm. He sent it anyway, a small, inadequate gesture of love across an impossible distance.

He stared out at the waves, at the gulls wheeling in the wind, and let the sheer hopelessness of his situation wash over him. The bookseller’s warning echoed in his mind. What if Finch never called? What if he was doomed to live like this, a walking antenna for the world's pain, forever haunted by the monstrous cure he’d been shown? Was this his life now? Skulking on the edges of the world, unable to work, unable to go home, unable to be with the woman he loved? The thought of the silence, the perfect, peaceful union from his vision, slithered back into his mind. It was no longer just a horrifying revelation; it was a temptation. A way out. The thought terrified him more than the noise. It was then, as he balanced on the knife-edge of despair, that his phone rang. The screen flashed: *Unknown Number*. His breath caught in his throat. He jabbed at the screen, his hand shaking. “Hello?”

The voice on the other end was dry and raspy, like old paper. It was frail, but held a wiry, intellectual intensity. “Is this Ewan Baird?”
“Yes. Who is this?” Ewan asked, though he already knew.
“My name is Alistair Finch. I’m told you went looking for me. A bookseller I know, a man with a misplaced sense of loyalty, passed on your number. He said you mentioned… the carrier wave.” The term was spoken with a kind of weary precision, a secret handshake.
“I did. I… I experienced it,” Ewan stammered, his mind racing. “There was a machine, in a lab at the university. I got a shock. Now I can’t turn it off. The noise. The hum. It’s not a theory, it’s real.”
There was a long silence on the other end of the line, a silence filled with the crackle of the connection and the howl of the wind outside the van. Ewan could feel Finch’s mind at work, not in the messy, emotional way of others, but as a cool, analytical process. It was like feeling the workings of a complex clock. “A machine,” Finch repeated, his voice laced with something Ewan couldn’t decipher. Alarm? Excitement? “Describe it.” Ewan described the cabinet, the coils, the glowing vacuum tubes, the rogue connection to the mains. He described the shock, the torrent of a billion lives, the terrible, absolute clarity of the revelation that followed. He didn’t mention cannibalism, he couldn’t bring himself to say the word, but he spoke of the corporeal bridge, the total communion, the silencing of the static.

When he finished, the silence from Finch’s end was even more profound. “God help you,” the old man finally whispered, the words devoid of any religious comfort. They were a statement of fact. “You’ve done more than just listen to the broadcast, you’ve plugged yourself into the transmitter. What you saw… the ‘solution’… it’s the logical endpoint. The terminal phase of the disease.”
“Is there a cure?” Ewan asked, the word catching in his throat. “Can you help me?”
“Cure?” Finch gave a dry, humourless laugh. “My dear boy, you don’t cure a truth. You can only learn to live with it. Or be consumed by it. I cannot help you, not over the phone. But perhaps I can… inoculate you. Give you context. A shield, of a sort.” Another pause. “I live a very quiet life, Mr. Baird. I do not welcome visitors. But you are a unique case. A field test, you might say. If you are serious, meet me tomorrow. Noon. There is a ruined chapel on the coast, north of St Andrews. St Fillan’s Chapel. Be alone. Bring nothing with you but the truth of your experience. If you are even a minute late, I will be gone.” The line went dead. Ewan sat in the roaring silence of his van, the phone still pressed to his ear. He had a destination. He had an appointment with the man who had identified the disease. And he felt a chilling certainty that the inoculation would be far more painful than the sickness itself.**Chapter 4**

The drive north was a flight into a different kind of silence. As Ewan guided the van over the Queensferry Crossing, the dense, chaotic weave of Edinburgh’s collective consciousness began to thin. The bridge itself was a torrent of transient anxieties—commuters worrying about meetings, families tense with the claustrophobia of a long journey—but once he was across and into the Kingdom of Fife, the psychic landscape changed. The noise floor dropped. The frantic, overlapping signals of the city were replaced by something slower, sparser, and lonelier. He drove through rolling green fields and small, stone-built towns, and the feelings he picked up were more muted, more spread out. He felt the stubborn, bone-deep weariness of a farmer surveying his land, the quiet melancholy of an elderly woman staring from a window in a coastal village, the slow-burning resentment of a teenager stuck in a town with one bus an hour. It wasn't the screaming riot of Edinburgh; it was the low, mournful drone of a cello played in an empty hall. In a way, it was worse. The city’s noise had been overwhelming, but it was the sound of life, of friction. This was the sound of lives lived in parallel, never touching, a quiet testament to the very separation the machine had shown him.

He thought of Isla, of the simple, inadequate text message he had sent. He could feel her, a distant point of light, her worry for him a constant, faint pulse he could just about detect beneath the local psychic weather. The love he felt for her was a sharp, physical ache, a phantom limb. He had fled from her to protect her from himself, from the monstrous logic nesting in his brain, but the separation was an agony. He was living the problem. He was an island, and the tide of noise was rising. The temptation of the solution, the memory of that perfect, silent peace, was a siren song that grew sweeter with every mile he put between himself and his old life. He gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white, forcing himself to focus on the road, on the promise of an answer, an inoculation, from the man who had set him on this path.

St Fillan’s Chapel wasn't on any tourist sign. He found it by following Finch's precise directions down a series of increasingly narrow farm tracks that eventually dissolved into a rutted path overlooking the sea. The ruin was a skeletal finger of stone pointing at a bruised sky. It stood on a headland, exposed to the full, relentless force of the North Sea wind. Ewan parked the van and walked the last hundred yards, the wind tearing at his clothes, trying to push him back. The air was clean and brutally cold, tasting of salt and wet earth. There were no other human signals here, only the vast, elemental roar of the wind and the percussive crash of waves on the rocks below. For the first time in days, the background hum of humanity was almost entirely gone, drowned out by the noise of the planet itself. It was a profound relief, like stepping out of a crowded, deafening room.

A figure was standing in the lee of the chapel’s one remaining wall, looking out at the churning sea. It had to be Finch. He was smaller and more brittle than Ewan remembered from the lecture hall, his wild grey hair now thinned and whipped into a frenzy by the wind. He wore a heavy, dark coat that seemed too big for his frame, and he leaned on a thick, gnarled walking stick. He didn't turn as Ewan approached, his attention fixed on the horizon. Ewan stopped a few feet away, the wind stealing the words from his mouth. He could feel nothing from the old man. It was the same shielded quiet he’d encountered in the bookshop, but stronger, more absolute. It was like standing next to a black hole.

“You came,” Finch said, his raspy voice almost lost in the wind. He finally turned, and his eyes, though clouded with age, were as burning and intense as Ewan remembered. They weren't the eyes of a madman, but of a man who had seen something intolerable and had somehow survived the seeing. “Good. Punctuality is a discipline. It’s a start.” He gestured with his stick towards the waves. “The Picts who built this place chose it for a reason. It is a thin place. The veil between worlds is worn here. Or so the mystics would say. The truth is simpler. It’s loud. The planet makes enough noise to drown out the neighbours. A useful refuge, for those who can hear them.”

Finch’s gaze settled on Ewan, and it was a physically uncomfortable sensation, an inspection on a level Ewan had never experienced. “The bookseller, a sentimental fool, said you understood the carrier wave. I find that unlikely. Tell me what it feels like. Not what you think it is. What it *feels* like.” Ewan swallowed, the cold air stinging his throat. “It feels like… drowning. In everyone else. Their anger, their wanting things, their sadness. It’s a static, a noise. A feeling of… wrongness. Like a badly earthed circuit that’s making everything hum, making the whole system unsafe.”

Finch nodded slowly, a flicker of grim satisfaction in his eyes. “Apt. The electrician’s metaphor. And the machine? The one in the laboratory? You said it gave you a revelation. A solution.” Ewan’s stomach tightened. He looked away from Finch, towards the grey sea. “It showed me a way to stop the noise. A… a joining. A communion. It showed me peace.” The word felt like a lie on his tongue. “Peace,” Finch scoffed, the sound a dry rustle. “You saw a predator consume its prey and mistook the silence that followed for harmony. You saw a fire burn a forest to the ground and called the ashes ‘tranquillity’. That is the Primal Fallacy, Mr. Baird. The seduction of the void.” He jabbed his stick into the soft turf for emphasis. “That machine… I theorised its existence, I drew the blueprints in a moment of intellectual hubris decades ago. I never imagined some fool at the medical school would actually build it. It’s an amplifier, a psychic tuning fork designed to resonate with the carrier wave and collapse the waveform. It doesn't show you the truth. It shows you the simplest, most brutal interpretation of it. It offers the peace of annihilation.”

Finch took a halting step closer, his eyes boring into Ewan. “The static you feel, the dissonance, the separation… it is not a flaw in the system. It *is* the system. It is the necessary condition for selfhood. The space between two people is what allows them to be two people. What you have been offered is a shortcut to unity that works by erasing one of the participants. It is the gospel of the cancer cell. Perfect, silent, and utterly deadly union. My inoculation, Mr. Baird, is not a cure for the noise. It is a lesson in how to live with it. It is the discipline of rebuilding the walls of the self, of learning to stand in the storm and not be swept away. It is the choice, every single second of every day, to remain an island. It is the loneliest work in the world. And right now, you are failing at it.”Finch’s words struck Ewan with the force of the wind, cold and sharp, knocking the air from his lungs. Failing. He was failing. He knew it, of course. Fleeing his job, abandoning his tools, running from Isla—it was all a frantic, chaotic retreat. But hearing it stated so baldly, by the one man who understood, felt like a final judgment. A wave of bitter resentment rose in him, a hot counter-current against the cold despair.

“How?” Ewan’s voice was a raw shout, snatched by the wind. “How am I supposed to do that? How do you build a wall against the whole world screaming in your head? It’s easy for you to talk about discipline, standing here in your… your fortress of quiet. You’ve had years to practice. I’ve had three days. It’s tearing me apart.” He took a step towards Finch, his fists clenched, the passive victim suddenly replaced by an angry, cornered animal. “You talk about the gospel of the cancer cell. I felt that. I almost… with my girlfriend, Isla… I looked at her and the noise stopped. The thought of…” He couldn't finish the sentence, the shame and horror of it choking him. The confession hung in the air between them, more shocking than any profanity.

Finch did not flinch. He did not recoil. His burning gaze held Ewan’s, and for the first time, Ewan detected a crack in the old man's analytical facade. It wasn’t pity, but a deep, ancient empathy, the sorrow of a fellow sufferer. “I know,” Finch said, his voice softer now, yet carrying with more weight than his earlier pronouncements. “That is the true test. When the Primal Fallacy stops being a philosophical concept and becomes a domestic solution. When the person you love most becomes the most immediate path to the silence you crave. That is the moment the disease can master you.”

He turned and gestured with his stick towards the ruined altar at the centre of the chapel. “Thirty years ago, I was not so different from you. I was a philosopher, arrogant and insulated by theory. My ‘accident’ was not a single, violent shock like yours, but a slow, deliberate immersion. I used sensory deprivation, fasting, psychoactive compounds… I forced the door open because I was arrogant enough to believe I could chart what lay beyond. And when I stepped through, the noise hit me, just as it hit you. I was not prepared. The first person I saw when I returned to the world was my wife. And I had the exact same thought you just confessed.”

The revelation stunned Ewan into silence. He looked at this brittle, isolated old man and saw not a remote academic, but a reflection of his own potential future. A man who had faced the same demon and had, somehow, won. Or at least, fought it to a standstill. “What did you do?” Ewan asked, his own anger deflating, replaced by a desperate, hungry need for a practical answer.

“I did what you did,” Finch said, a grim line to his mouth. “I ran. I left her. I left my home, my job, my entire life. I told her I was having a breakdown, which was the truest lie I have ever told. I understood that I could not be a husband and a man who knew this truth. Not then. The love I felt for her made the temptation of union too powerful. The only way to save her from my 'love' was to remove myself from her life entirely.” He paused, looking out at the grey, indifferent sea. “That is one way to build a wall. The coward’s way. The way of amputation. I do not recommend it. It leaves you with phantoms.”

Finch turned back, his expression hardening into that of a teacher. “The other way is harder. It is the work of a stonemason, not a demolitions expert. You learn to sort the signals. You are an electrician, Mr. Baird. Think of it this way. Right now, you are a single, unshielded wire picking up every stray signal in the world—radio, television, mobile phones, the works. It’s an incoherent mess. The first step is not to block it all, but to learn to tune to a single, chosen frequency. To isolate one signal from the noise.” He pointed a bony finger at Ewan’s chest. “Start with the quietest one. Your own. Find the signal of your own body. The thrum of blood in your ears. The rhythm of your own breathing. The ache in your own muscles. Focus on that. It is your anchor in the storm. All the other noise, all the other people, they are the weather. They are not you. You must learn to feel the rain without becoming the flood.”Ewan stared at Finch, the wind whipping tears from his eyes. It sounded so simple, so infuriatingly abstract. It was the kind of advice Isla might have offered after reading a mindfulness blog, the sort of thing he would have grunted at over his morning paper. Feel the rain without becoming the flood. It was poetry, not a practical solution. He was a man who dealt in copper and plastic, in definite voltages and measurable resistance. This was smoke.

“That’s it?” he demanded, his voice thick with incredulity. “That’s your great inoculation? Breathe deep and think happy thoughts? I have the sound of a million miserable lives grinding away in my skull, a vision that wants me to start eating people, and you’re telling me to focus on the ache in my knuckles? What the hell is that supposed to do?”

Finch’s expression didn't soften. It became sharper, more severe. “It is not about thinking happy thoughts, you fool. It is about establishing a fact. The fact of your own existence, separate from all others. You are an electrician. If you have a chaotic signal on a line, what do you do? You don’t destroy the transmitter. You shield the damned cable. You ground the interference. Right now, your entire nervous system is an unshielded cable, and you are standing in the middle of a power station. The work is to build your own insulation, millimetre by millimetre. Your own body is the only grounding wire you have that connects directly to your own earth, and not the world's.”

The professor took a step back, leaning heavily on his stick, and pointed towards a flat, moss-covered stone. “Sit. Close your eyes.” Ewan hesitated, a rebellious frustration still warring with his desperation. “Do it!” Finch’s voice was a whip-crack over the wind. Grudgingly, Ewan sat, the damp cold of the stone immediately seeping through his trousers. He closed his eyes, and the world of noise rushed in, even more vivid without visual distraction. He felt the distant, gnawing boredom of a checkout girl in a St Andrews supermarket, the simmering marital rage in a farmhouse five miles away, the sudden spike of fear from a rabbit bolting from a fox. It was a dizzying, nauseating flood.

“You are listening outwards,” Finch’s voice cut through the chaos. “A rookie mistake. Stop trying to make sense of the storm. It has no sense. It just is. Bring your attention home. Start with the wind. Don’t feel the world’s sadness, feel the cold air on your own skin. Is it on your cheeks? Your eyelids? The back of your neck? Be specific. Name the sensations to yourself. This is data. Your data.” Ewan tried. He focused on the raw, physical feeling of the wind. It was cold, yes. It was biting. But beneath it, the other feelings still churned. He could feel the professor's own disciplined energy, a cool, controlled presence, and beside it, his own frantic, desperate panic.

“It’s not working,” Ewan said, his voice tight. “I can feel you. I can feel me. I can feel everyone else. It’s all just… tangled.” In response, Finch’s hand suddenly clamped down on his shoulder. The grip was surprisingly strong, the old man’s fingers digging into his muscle like talons. The sudden, sharp sensation was a shock to his system, a localized burst of pure physical information. “Good,” Finch’s voice was right beside his ear now, low and intense. “Use that. That is not the farmer’s rage or the checkout girl’s boredom. That is my hand on your shoulder. It is happening to you, and only you. Trace the feeling. Where does the pressure start and where does it end? Follow the ache down your arm. Now, find another sensation. The rough texture of the stone beneath you. The way your spine presses against it. The pull of your own weight. These things are your property. Claim them.”

Ewan gritted his teeth and focused, using the sharp pain in his shoulder as an anchor. He concentrated on the pressure, the surprising strength in Finch's grip. He let his mind follow the sensation, and then, as instructed, he reached for another. The cold, damp reality of the stone. The rhythmic, insistent pounding of his own heart, a frantic drumbeat against his ribs. For a single, miraculous second, the external world fell away. It was still there, he knew, but it was no longer inside his head. It was outside. It was a radio playing in another room, its volume turned way down. The roar had become a hum. In the relative silence, he could feel his own exhaustion, the deep ache in his bones, the hunger in his stomach. He was just a man. A cold, tired, frightened man sitting on a rock. It was the most welcome he had ever felt in his own body.

The moment of peace shattered. A wave of pure, undiluted terror and agony crashed over him, so sudden and violent it almost threw him from the stone. It was a car. A screech of tyres on wet asphalt, the sickening crunch of metal, a woman’s scream of horrified grief that was not a sound but a psychic shriek that pierced right through him. It was happening on the A-road, a few miles away. The clarity was appalling. He felt the phantom impact, the sudden, shocking cessation of one life, the explosive grief of another. He gasped, his eyes flying open, his fragile shield obliterated. He was back in the flood, drowning faster than before.

Finch’s grip tightened, a painful, grounding pressure. “Hold on,” he commanded, his voice strained. “You are the rock. The wave is breaking over you. It is not you. Name what it is. It is terror. It is grief. It is shock. They are signals from a stranger. You are the receiver, not the source. Acknowledge the message, and then let the wave recede. It is not your tragedy to drown in.” Ewan squeezed his eyes shut again, shaking, his teeth chattering from a cold that was no longer just physical. He tried to do as he was told, to mentally label the feelings, to separate them from himself. He focused on the pain in his shoulder, the cold of the stone, the roar of the wind. Slowly, agonizingly, the terrible wave began to pull back, leaving behind a profound and terrible sadness, a psychic echo that still vibrated in the air. He was left trembling, hollowed out, but he was still there. He was still himself.

Finally, Finch released his shoulder. The effort had cost the old man; he was leaning heavily on his stick, his breathing ragged. The inoculation was over. “This is your work now,” Finch said, his voice weary. “Every minute of every day. You are a lighthouse keeper on an island of one. You must tend your own light, or you will be dashed on the rocks of other people's lives. And you must never, ever mistake the roar of the sea for a song that is meant for you.” He turned to leave, then paused, giving Ewan one last, chilling piece of instruction. “One more thing, Mr. Baird. The men who built that machine… they were not academics. They are not interested in philosophy. They are engineers of the soul. They believe, as you saw, that separation is a flaw to be corrected. They are not madmen. They are utopians. And there is nothing more dangerous than a utopian with a blueprint and a power source. You have experienced their proof of concept. They will want to know about their results. Do not let them find you.”The words settled into the hollow space the car crash had carved inside him, a new and colder fear. It was one thing to be afflicted by a random accident, a freak of electrical physics. It was another thing entirely to be the unintended result of a deliberate experiment, a human lab rat who had escaped the maze. The formless, chaotic threat of the psychic noise was now joined by a directed, intelligent one. Utopians. Engineers of the soul. The phrases sounded like they belonged in one of Finch’s dusty books, but the machine had been real, the shock had been real, and the pursuit, Ewan felt with a sickening certainty, would be just as real.

“Who?” Ewan asked, his voice hoarse. “Who are they? Where? How do I know who to look for?” Finch shook his head, a gesture of finality. He pulled his heavy coat tighter around his thin frame, as if preparing to step into an even colder wind. “You don’t. That is the point. They are not an organization you can look up in a phone book. Think of them as a philosophy, a church with no name. They are academics, industrialists, technicians. People who see humanity as a problem to be solved, an inefficient network to be optimized. To them, your privacy, your selfhood, your soul—it is all just noise in the signal. My telling you more would be like painting a target on your back. Your only defence is anonymity. Your only weapon is the discipline I have shown you. Become a black spot in their data. A ghost in their machine.” With that, Finch turned and began to walk away, his gnarled stick finding purchase in the damp earth. He didn’t look back. Ewan was left alone in the ruins, the wind howling through the empty windows of the chapel, a sound that was suddenly full of menace.

For a long moment, Ewan didn’t move. He was a statue of indecision, caught between the urge to run after Finch and beg for more, and the paralysing weight of his new reality. He was prey. He looked at his hands, calloused and capable, the hands of a man who fixed things. They felt useless now. He couldn’t rewire this problem. He couldn’t insulate himself from a threat he couldn’t see. He sank back down onto the cold stone, the echo of the distant crash, the ghost of that stranger’s grief, still clinging to him like sea mist. Finch’s words returned to him. *Find the signal of your own body. Claim it.* He closed his eyes and tried again, this time without the professor’s guidance. He focused on the raw ache in his lower back from the long drive. He focused on the tremor in his fingers. He focused on the rhythmic, insistent beat of his own heart. He built a small, fragile wall of sensation around himself, not to keep the world out, but to keep himself in. The psychic weather still raged beyond his perimeter, but he was no longer adrift in it. He was on his island, and the lighthouse, however feeble, was lit.

The drive south was a continuous, exhausting act of concentration. Every car that passed was a potential wave of emotion threatening to breach his new, flimsy sea walls. A lorry driver, his mind a thick stew of fatigue and road-rage, blasted past him, and Ewan felt the man’s anger as a physical pressure against his temples. He didn’t let it in. He felt it, acknowledged it—*anger, impatience, not mine*—and then tightened his grip on the steering wheel, focusing on the cheap, familiar texture of the plastic, the vibration of the engine through the floor. He passed a family car, and the complex, overlapping signals of four people trapped in a small space—a child’s petulant boredom, a mother’s anxious forward-planning, a father’s weary resignation—lapped at his consciousness. He anchored himself to the squeak of his own windscreen wipers against the glass. It was gruelling, conscious work. He was a man learning to breathe again, each inhalation a deliberate choice, each exhalation a small victory against the impulse to drown.

He couldn’t go home. That much was brutally clear. The thought of Isla, of her warm, open, undefended mind, was unbearable. He could not risk bringing this new danger to her door, could not risk his own discipline failing in her presence. The temptation to find peace in her, through the terrible means the machine had shown him, was a monster he had to starve. He needed to disappear. Not just from the ‘engineers,’ but from his entire life. As he drove, a plan began to form, a grim and necessary strategy for survival. He drove past the turn-off for the bridge back to Edinburgh and kept heading south, into the rolling hills of the Borders. He needed somewhere quiet, somewhere anonymous, a place where one more person with a haunted look in their eyes wouldn't be noticed. His van, with his company logo on the side, was a beacon. His phone was a tracking device. He was an electrician, a registered sole trader. He was a man made of paper trails. To become a ghost, Ewan Baird had to die.**Chapter 5**

The death of Ewan Baird began in a small, rain-swept town in the Scottish Borders, a place of grey stone and quiet resentment. The psychic noise here was a dull, persistent ache, the accumulated grievances and stoic endurances of generations. It was the feeling of a community slowly turning in on itself, a world away from the ambitious shriek of Edinburgh. Ewan pulled the van into a supermarket car park, the bright logos and promises of low prices a garish lie against the muted backdrop of the town’s emotional landscape. He needed cash, a lot of it. Walking to the bank, he felt like a spy in enemy territory. The queue was a study in low-stakes misery: a woman’s fretful worry over an unexpected bill, a man’s simmering impatience, a teenager’s vast, formless boredom. Ewan stood among them, a live wire of hyper-awareness, and practiced his new, desperate meditation. He focused on the worn linoleum floor beneath his boots, the cool, conditioned air on his face, the hard plastic of his bank card in his hand. *This is me. That is them.* He was building his wall, one miserable sensation at a time. At the counter, he withdrew the maximum he could, a thick wedge of notes that felt dirty and unreal. The cashier’s flicker of professional curiosity was a psychic probe he instinctively deflected, focusing on the thrum of the fluorescent lights above until she looked away, satisfied. He walked out of the bank feeling like a criminal, the cash a heavy, damning burden in his pocket.

Next was the van. It was more than a vehicle; it was his history, his livelihood, his identity. The custom racking in the back, the faint, permanent scent of burnt plastic and copper, the worn patch on the driver’s seat—it was all him. He drove it miles out of town, up a winding single-track road that led into a vast, dark conifer plantation. He found a secluded logging track, overgrown and forgotten, and pulled the van in as far as it would go, the branches of spruce trees scraping a mournful farewell along its sides. He sat for a long time in the driver's seat, the engine ticking as it cooled. He looked at the jumble of tools in the back: his multimeters, his wire strippers, his insulated screwdrivers. They were extensions of his hands, the instruments of a life that made sense, a life of finding faults and making things right. Taking them would be to cling to a man who no longer existed. He took only his rucksack, stuffing it with a waterproof jacket, a change of clothes, and the brick of cash. He left the keys in the ignition, a final, absurd offering. As he slammed the door shut for the last time, the sound was unnaturally loud in the quiet forest, a full stop at the end of a life.

The last wire to be cut was the hardest. He stood in the deep green gloom of the forest and pulled out his phone. His thumb hovered over Isla’s contact picture, her smile a beacon from a world he had already lost. He could feel her, a distant, persistent ache of worry hundreds of miles away. The urge to call her, to hear her voice, to tell her he was a monster but that he loved her, was a physical force that made him tremble. But he knew what would happen. He would break. He would try to explain, and the madness would pour out, and he would either terrify her into leaving or, worse, tempt her into trying to save him, pulling her into the path of the hunters. He opened a new message, his fingers clumsy and cold. *‘Something broke. Not the wiring this time. Me. I have to go away and fix it. Please, Isla. Don’t look for me. Live your life. I love you more than you know.’* He hit send before he could lose his nerve, the word ‘Delivered’ a confirmation of his own damnation. He turned the phone off, popped the SIM card, and snapped it in two. Then, with a surge of desperate, violent finality, he smashed the phone against a rock, again and again, until the screen was a spiderweb of dead crystals and the case was splintered plastic. He threw the pieces deep into the woods, in different directions. The last connection was severed. He was truly alone.

A new man walked out of the forest an hour later. Or rather, a non-man. He was just a figure in a dark jacket with a rucksack, trudging along the verge of a B-road as the drizzle thickened. In the next town, a place called Hawick that felt steeped in a stubborn, almost prideful decline, he found a charity shop. He bought a pair of worn, anonymous jeans, a thick, scratchy jumper, and a nondescript wool hat, paying with a crisp note from his wad of cash. In the shop’s grimy bathroom, he changed, stuffing his old, company-branded work clothes into a bin. He looked at his reflection in the cracked mirror. The face was familiar—the same tired eyes, the same worried lines—but the context was gone. He was no longer Ewan Baird, Electrician from Leith. He was just a man. A ghost. And as he walked back out into the street, he noticed a subtle shift in the psychic noise. The world’s feelings no longer seemed directed at him. He was beneath notice, a piece of driftwood in the current. It was the first real peace he had felt in days, the bleak and lonely freedom of being nobody at all.

Night fell with a damp, permeating chill. He needed shelter. The idea of a hotel with its reception desks and registration forms was unthinkable. He walked the back streets of the town until he found what he was looking for: a dilapidated stone house with a hand-painted sign that read ‘B&B - Vacancies’. The place radiated a profound sense of weariness. The landlady who answered the door was a woman in her seventies, her mind a murky pool of physical aches, financial worries, and a deep, abiding apathy. She barely looked at him, her attention caught only by the twenty-pound notes he held out. “Room seven, top of the stairs. Bathroom’s on the landing. No breakfast,” she rasped, and shuffled back into the gloom of her living room, where the blare of a game show was the only sign of life. The room was small and cold, with a single bed, a stained sink, and a window that overlooked a dripping, lightless alley. It smelled of damp wallpaper and a hundred other transient lives. It was perfect.

He locked the door, the click of the bolt a small, satisfying sound of security. He sat on the edge of the lumpy bed and the full, crushing weight of his actions descended upon him. He had no van, no tools, no phone. He had a bag of money that would eventually run out and a secret that would last forever. He had abandoned the woman he loved with a cruel, cryptic message. He was a ghost, yes, but ghosts are defined by what haunts them. He was haunted by Isla’s face, by the memory of competence, by the phantom vibration of his phone in his pocket. He lay back on the thin mattress, the scratchy blanket pulled up to his chin, and listened. He could feel the slow, sleeping pulse of the town around him—dreams of forgotten glories, anxieties about tomorrow’s rain, the slow, steady heartbeat of a world that continued to turn without him. He was an island, adrift on a dark and silent sea, and for the first time, he did not fight the current. He simply floated, listening to the rhythm of his own breathing in the cold, anonymous dark, tending his own small, flickering light.**Chapter 6**

The days that followed fell into a strange, featureless rhythm. Ewan became a creature of the town's periphery, his existence dictated by the avoidance of others. He would wake in the cold B&B room before dawn, the landlady's rattling cough and the psychic fug of her troubled sleep his only alarm clock. He’d leave before anyone else was stirring, walking for hours along the banks of the River Teviot or up into the gorse-covered hills that cradled the town. He learned the landscape not by its landmarks, but by its psychic topography. There was a certain bend in the river that held a lingering sadness, a place where, decades ago, a local tragedy had stained the very air. There was a high ridge where the wind blew so clean and hard it seemed to scour the world of all human feeling, offering him precious moments of absolute clarity.

His discipline, the one Finch had given him, became his sole occupation. It was a constant, gruelling labour. As he walked, he practiced. A cyclist passed, radiating a fierce, competitive determination; Ewan anchored himself to the crunch of his own boots on the gravel path until the feeling was just a passing wake in the water. A farmer’s frustration with a broken fence washed over him from a nearby field; he focused on the rough bark of a pine tree, tracing its patterns with his eyes until the feeling receded back to its source. He was becoming adept at it, building his internal walls stronger and higher. But the effort was immense. By the end of each day, he would return to his grim little room feeling as exhausted as if he had run a marathon, his mind aching from the strain of constant vigilance.

The cash in his rucksack was a finite resource, a countdown timer on this monastic existence. He ate frugally, buying sandwiches and fruit from small corner shops, always paying with cash, never making eye contact, his hat pulled low. He was a shadow, a brief, forgettable transaction. But the loneliness was a cancer. In the long, dark evenings, with nothing but the four damp walls of his room for company, the memories of Isla would return with an agonizing vividness. He would see her smile, hear the specific cadence of her laugh, and the chasm he had created between them would feel like a physical wound. In these moments of weakness, the Primal Fallacy, the machine's terrible solution, would whisper to him from the dark. It promised an end to this pain. It promised reunion. The most perfect, absolute reunion. He would have to stand up, pace the small room, his heart hammering, focusing on the cold of the floorboards under his bare feet, battling a temptation that felt more like a part of him with every passing day. The silence he'd found was not peace; it was a vacuum, and the universe, he was learning, abhorred it.

One afternoon, seeking refuge from a sudden downpour, he ducked into the town's small public library. It was a risky move, a container of people, but the rain was torrential and the thought of his grim room was unbearable. The psychic atmosphere was what he expected: a gentle hum of quiet concentration, the flickering daydreams of the bored, the low-level anxiety of someone job-searching on a computer. It was manageable. He found a corner in the local history section, a dusty aisle that smelled of binding glue and silverfish, and pulled a random, heavy volume from the shelf. He didn’t read it; he just held it, using its solid, physical presence as an anchor. He let his gaze drift over the room, practicing his detachment, observing the human signals without letting them in. And then he felt it.

It was a signal unlike any other he had encountered. It was not the messy, emotional broadcast of a human mind. It was clean, cold, and analytical. It felt… synthetic. It was a scanning frequency, a methodical sweep of the room, not feeling, but *assessing*. Ewan’s blood ran cold. He didn’t dare look up. He kept his eyes fixed on the page of his book, his heart hammering against his ribs. He tried to pinpoint the source. It was coming from a man sitting at a table near the main entrance, his back to Ewan. The man looked unremarkable—middle-aged, dressed in a plain grey suit, reading a newspaper. But the psychic signal coming from him was that of a predator. It was the signal of a search engine, of an algorithm sorting through data. It was the mental signature of a hunter looking for a specific anomaly in the background noise. Looking for him. The ghost had been seen.

A primitive, animal terror seized him. He wanted to bolt, to crash through the nearest window and run until his lungs burned. But he heard Finch’s voice in his head, cold and precise: *Become a black spot in their data.* To run would be to flare up, to identify himself as the anomaly. He forced himself to remain still, to control his breathing. He focused every ounce of his will on his discipline, on his anchor. The heavy book in his hands. The smell of dust. The pressure of his feet flat on the floor. He tried to bank his own fire, to dim his psychic light, to become just another part of the library's quiet, mundane hum. The scanning signal swept over him. For a terrifying moment, it felt like it paused, like a spotlight hovering. He felt a cold, impersonal curiosity directed at him, a query being run. *Subject exhibits elevated heart rate. Adrenal response detected. But within acceptable parameters for ambient anxiety. No broadcast signature detected. False positive.* The analytical presence moved on, continuing its sweep of the room. Ewan didn't dare breathe. He stayed frozen, a mouse playing dead under the shadow of a hawk. After a few eternal minutes, the man in the grey suit folded his newspaper, stood, and walked out of the library. The clean, cold signal vanished, leaving only the familiar, messy warmth of human minds. Ewan stayed in his corner for a full hour, shaking, the heavy book clutched in his white-knuckled hands. The hunt was real. His fragile peace was shattered. He wasn't just hiding anymore. He was being actively pursued. His island was no longer a refuge; it was a target.The walk back to the B&B was a journey through a newly hostile world. Every shadow seemed to lengthen, every passing car held a potential threat. The town that had been his anonymous refuge now felt like a cage, its quiet streets a network of traps. He no longer felt the townsfolk’s general malaise; his senses were stretched taut, scanning for that one cold, clean, synthetic signal. He was a deer that had scented the wolf, and the entire forest now felt predatory. He practiced the discipline, but it had changed. He was no longer just building a wall; he was actively trying to become a psychic void, pulling his own energy inward, damping down the panicked flutter of his heart and the frantic racing of his thoughts, trying to mimic the dull, inanimate psychic resonance of the pavement beneath his feet.

In his small, cold room, he moved with a frantic, silent urgency. He shoved his few belongings into his rucksack, his hands shaking. The landlady’s television droned on downstairs, the artificial cheerfulness of the programme a grotesque counterpoint to his terror. He paused by the grimy window, peering down into the dark, wet alley. Was the man in the grey suit out there? Was he listening, not with his ears, but with his cold, analytical sense? Ewan knew with a sickening certainty that these people, these engineers of the soul, wouldn't be so easily fooled. His successful camouflage in the library was a temporary victory, a trick that would not work twice. They knew an anomaly was in this area. They would be methodical. They would be closing the net.

He didn't wait for morning. He left another twenty-pound note on the rickety nightstand, a silent payment for his hurried departure, and slipped out into the night. The rain had eased to a persistent drizzle, and the town was asleep, its psychic hum a low, dreaming murmur. He didn't take the main road. He cut through back alleys and unlit lanes, following the river out of town, moving like a wraith through the sleeping world. The darkness was a comfort, a cloak for his physical form, but he knew his real vulnerability was the light of his own consciousness, a beacon in the psychic dark. He walked for miles, his boots squelching on the muddy towpath, the cold seeping into his bones, his mind racing.

He had made a critical error. Finch had told him to become an island, and he had sought out a quiet archipelago, a place where his island was distinct and easy to chart. He had thought the quiet would give him peace to practice his discipline, but he had misunderstood the nature of the war he was in. A quiet battlefield gives a sniper a clear shot. What he needed was the opposite. He needed chaos. He needed a psychic battlefield so loud, so vast, so full of screaming, exploding signals that his own desperate frequency would be lost in the cacophony. He needed to hide his single, terrified voice in a choir of millions.

The realisation was a cold, hard clarity in the centre of his fear. He had to go back to the city. Not Edinburgh. They would expect that. He had fled from Leith, from Isla; it was a place of connections, a place they could triangulate. He needed a place with more noise, more people, more chaos, more misery. A place where a million other desperate souls were broadcasting their own static, creating a psychic fog so thick that even a methodical hunter would struggle to find a clear signal. His mind latched onto the name, a place he knew only by reputation and rivalry. Glasgow. It was bigger, denser, and by all accounts, grittier than Edinburgh. It was a city that wore its heart and its hardships on its sleeve. It was the perfect storm to get lost in. The decision solidified into a plan, a desperate gambit born of terror. He was no longer running away. He was running towards the noise. He was a ghost, and he was about to haunt the biggest, loudest house he could find.**Chapter 7**

The journey to Glasgow was a pilgrimage into the heart of the storm. He got his first lift on the cold, dark shoulder of the A7, from a lorry driver hauling timber south before turning west. The man’s mind was a placid lake of professional focus, his thoughts a slow, looping mantra of gear changes, road signs, and the price of diesel. It was a relief. Ewan sat in the high cab, the rhythmic vibration of the massive engine a powerful, grounding hum. He anchored himself to it, using the physical reality of the truck as a shield against the fleeting anxieties of the cars that sped past them in the dark. The driver, a man named Tam, tried to make small talk, his curiosity a gentle, prodding signal. Ewan deflected it with practiced vagueness and short answers, focusing his mental energy on dimming his own presence until he was little more than a piece of sentient luggage. When Tam dropped him at a service station near Abington, he felt a small, sharp pang of something like gratitude. He had shared a space with another human being for two hours and had not felt the urge to either run screaming or consume him. It was a victory.

From there, it was a series of shorter hops. A young salesman in a company car, his mind a frantic, buzzing hive of targets and commissions. A trio of students heading to a music festival, their collective consciousness a giddy, chaotic swirl of anticipation, alcohol, and burgeoning romantic dramas. With each ride, Ewan grew more adept at the discipline. He learned to use the specific environment of each car as his anchor: the scent of a cheap air freshener, the rattle of a loose piece of trim, the thumping bass of a student’s playlist. He was no longer just building a wall; he was learning the art of psychic camouflage, bending his own signal to blend in with his immediate surroundings, becoming a man whose inner world was as mundane as the worn upholstery he sat on. The closer he got to Glasgow, the more the psychic terrain began to shift. The lonely, melancholic drone of the Borders gave way to the denser, more complex hum of the commuter towns, and then, as the first sodium lights of the city’s sprawl appeared on the horizon, the hum began to build into a roar.

A final lift in a delivery van dropped him on the eastern edge of the city, in a sprawling industrial area under a sky the colour of a day-old bruise. The moment his feet hit the pavement, the full force of Glasgow hit him. It was a physical blow. If Edinburgh’s hum was a persistent, historical resonance, Glasgow’s was a live power cable, arcing and spitting in the rain. It was a cacophony of life, raw and deafening. He felt the sheer, crushing weight of a million lives lived in close proximity, their joys, miseries, and aggressions all bleeding into one another. He felt the fierce, defiant pride of a city that had been knocked down a thousand times and had gotten back up a thousand and one. He felt the anger, the humour, the despair, the love, all tangled together in a glorious, terrifying, beautiful mess. It was overwhelming. It was perfect. For the first time, he felt a flicker of hope. In a sea this loud, how could anyone ever hope to hear a single drop of rain?

He walked for over an hour, heading instinctively towards the oldest, densest parts of the city. He bypassed the gleaming, modern city centre with its managed, corporate static, and pushed east, into the world of red and blond sandstone tenements, their grand, decaying facades stained black by a century of coal smoke. He walked down the Gallowgate, the area’s psychic signature a volatile mix of hard-drinking camaraderie, simmering violence, and a deep, unshakable sense of belonging. The air was thick with the smells of frying onions and spilled beer, and the noise was a constant, overlapping roar of televisions, arguments, and laughter from behind the tall tenement windows. He was an alien here, but so was everyone else. The sheer anonymity was a balm. He was just another face in the crowd, another soul adding his own quiet note of desperation to the city's grand, discordant symphony.

In a newsagent’s window, tucked between ads for psychic readers and discount mobile phone repairs, he saw a small, handwritten card: ‘Room to Let. Single Occupancy. Enquire within.’ The shop itself was a hub of frantic, low-level energy, the owner’s mind a frantic calculation of pennies and pence. Ewan was directed to a close next door, a dark, tiled entryway that smelled of damp and disinfectant. He climbed four flights of a wide, stone staircase, the psychic echoes of a hundred years of residents clinging to the walls. He felt the phantom arguments, the ghosts of children’s games, the lingering weariness of people hauling their shopping and their lives up these same stairs. The door was opened by a thin, wiry man with a cigarette dangling from his lips and eyes that missed nothing. The man’s mind was a fortress, not shielded like the bookseller’s, but cynical and sharp, a lifetime of mistrust honed to a razor’s edge. He named a price for the room, cash, weekly, in advance. Ewan paid without haggling.

The room was a small box at the back of the flat, overlooking a courtyard filled with overflowing bins. It contained a narrow bed, a rickety wardrobe, and a small, cracked sink. The single window was grimy, and the sounds of the city poured in, muted but ever-present. He could hear a baby crying in the flat below, a furious argument in Gaelic from across the courtyard, the bassline of a techno track vibrating through the floor. And beneath it all, he could feel the corresponding emotions: the mother’s frayed exhaustion, the old man’s bitter, wounded pride, the teenager’s defiant, joyful hedonism. It was a solid wall of noise, a fortress of other people’s lives. He locked the door, slid his rucksack under the bed, and sat on the lumpy mattress. The man in the grey suit, his cold, scanning presence, felt a universe away. He was a single, undocumented data point in a system collapsing under the weight of its own information. He was safe. And as he sat there, in his squalid, perfect sanctuary, the full weight of his loneliness crashed down on him. He had found his hiding place, but the price was to become a ghost even to himself, haunted by the memory of a woman and a life that he could never have again.**Chapter 8**

The city did not offer peace, but it provided cover. Ewan’s life in Glasgow shrank to the dimensions of his small, damp room and the few anonymous streets around it. His days were a gruelling exercise in psychic defence. He would wake to the tenement’s symphony: the sharp, anxious jolt of an alarm clock from the flat above, the slow, aching dread of the old man across the courtyard facing another day alone, the fierce, unconditional love of the young mother below him as she hushed her crying baby. He would lie on his lumpy mattress and feel it all wash over him, a daily baptism in the turbulent waters of humanity. Then, the work would begin. He’d anchor himself to the cold reality of the linoleum on the floor, the metallic taste of the tap water, the simple, solid presence of his own body. He was a monk in a monastery of noise, his discipline a constant, silent prayer against the world.

He learned the city's emotional currents, the way the psychic weather changed with the time of day. Mornings were a frantic, anxious rush. Afternoons held a weary, trudging resignation. Friday nights were a volcanic eruption of pent-up desires and aggressions, a wave of raw, intoxicating energy that was the hardest to defend against. He walked the streets not as a sightseer, but as a diver navigating a treacherous reef, constantly aware of the dangerous currents of emotion swirling around him. He saw a young couple kiss in the rain, and had to brace himself against the tidal wave of their infatuation, a feeling so potent it threatened to dissolve his own lonely identity. He passed a pub where a fight was brewing, and the thick, heavy atmosphere of impending violence felt like a pressure drop in the air, making him physically nauseous. He was surviving, but he was not living. He was a recording device, a seismograph for the soul, and the constant tremors were wearing him down.

The cracks in his fortress began to show in the quiet moments. One evening, sitting in his room as the city’s light turned a bruised purple, he heard a woman in a neighbouring flat humming a simple, off-key lullaby to her child. It was a sound he’d heard Isla hum a thousand times when she was working at her pottery wheel, lost in her own world. The sound, and the pure, uncomplicated love it carried, bypassed his walls as if they weren’t there. A wave of grief so profound and absolute struck him that he doubled over, gasping for air. His carefully constructed island was submerged in an instant. In the depths of that sorrow, the machine’s logic surfaced, sleek and venomous. It whispered of a permanent end to this pain, a final, perfect union where no memory could ever hurt him again. He saw Isla’s face, not as a lost love, but as an unfinished circuit, a promise of silence. He scrambled off the bed, his hands pressed to his head, and stumbled around the small room, chanting Finch’s instructions like a madman’s mantra. *The ache in my feet. The cold of the windowpane. The splinter in the floorboard. My pain. My body. Not hers. Not the solution.* He fought for his own lonely existence for nearly an hour, and when the wave finally receded, it left him shivering and hollowed out on the floor, weaker than ever before.

His dwindling cash was a more concrete and immediate terror. He counted the crumpled notes one night under the dim light of his single, bare bulb. There wasn't much left. Enough for another two, maybe three weeks of rent and cheap food if he was careful. After that, destitution. The prospect of being on the streets, with no room to hide, no door to lock, was terrifying. The discipline required a baseline of physical security he was about to lose. The fear was a new, grinding frequency in his own mind, making it even harder to separate his own signal from the city's. He had to find work. But his name, his trade, his entire documented history were a liability. Ewan Baird, the electrician, was a man with a tax record, a business address, a digital footprint a mile wide. To resurrect him would be to light a flare in the dark for the men in grey suits.

The building itself gave him the answer. For days, the lights on the central staircase had been flickering erratically. It wasn't the gentle pulse of a dying bulb; it was a frantic, irregular stutter, accompanied by a faint smell of ozone that only he would notice. He could feel the fault in the walls, a point of high resistance, a hot, angry knot of potential fire in the ancient, overloaded wiring. It was a classic tenement problem, a death trap in the making. Every time he climbed the stairs, he could feel the illicit energy, a dissonant chord in the building's hum, and the part of him that was a good electrician, the part that fixed things, screamed in protest. He watched his neighbours—the old man, the young mother, the cynical landlord—pass under the flickering light, oblivious to the danger they were in, and he felt a surge of professional frustration that momentarily eclipsed his fear.

One evening, the flickering stopped. The staircase was plunged into an unnerving darkness, broken only by the slivers of light from under people’s doors. A few minutes later, he felt a sharp spike of panic from the flat below. The young mother, whose name he’d learned was Shona. Her baby was crying, a thin, distressed wail. Ewan could feel her specific anxiety with painful clarity: the power in her flat was out. The kettle wouldn't boil for the baby's bottle. The single electric heater she relied on was dead. Her fear was not abstract; it was a cold, practical terror that cut through the general noise of the city and landed squarely in his gut. He stood in his room, his hand on the doorknob, his heart hammering. To stay hidden was to be safe. To help was to risk everything. But to listen to that baby cry, to feel that mother's helpless panic, knowing he could fix it in twenty minutes? That, he realised, was another kind of damnation. He had been so focused on saving himself from the world, he hadn’t considered the possibility of saving a small piece of it. It was a choice: remain a ghost, or become a man again, if only for a night. With a deep, shuddering breath that was both a prayer and a curse, he opened his door and walked down the dark staircase towards the sound of crying.The journey to Glasgow was a pilgrimage into the heart of the storm.

From there, it was a series of shorter hops, a frantic scramble across the country’s central belt. He rode with a young salesman in a company car, his mind a frantic, buzzing hive of targets and commissions, and Ewan hid himself in the monotonous scent of the cheap vanilla air freshener hanging from the mirror. He caught a ride with a trio of students heading to a music festival, their collective consciousness a giddy, chaotic swirl of anticipation, alcohol, and burgeoning romantic dramas, and he anchored himself to the thumping, repetitive bass of their music until their psychic energy was just another meaningless vibration. With each ride, Ewan grew more adept at the discipline. He was no longer just building a wall; he was learning the art of psychic camouflage, bending his own signal to blend in with his immediate surroundings, becoming a man whose inner world was as mundane as the worn upholstery he sat on.

To resurrect him would be to light a flare in the dark for the men in grey suits.

The building itself gave him the answer. For days, the lights on the central staircase had been flickering erratically. It wasn't the gentle pulse of a dying bulb; it was a frantic, irregular stutter, accompanied by a faint smell of ozone that only he would notice. He could feel the fault in the walls, a point of high resistance, a hot, angry knot of potential fire in the ancient, overloaded wiring. It was a classic tenement problem, a death trap in the making. Every time he climbed the stairs, he could feel the illicit energy, a dissonant chord in the building's hum, and the part of him that was a good electrician, the part that fixed things, screamed in protest. He watched his neighbours—the old man, the young mother, the cynical landlord—pass under the flickering light, oblivious to the danger they were in, and he felt a surge of professional frustration that momentarily eclipsed his fear.

One evening, the flickering stopped. The staircase was plunged into an unnerving darkness, broken only by the slivers of light from under people’s doors. A few minutes later, he felt a sharp spike of panic from the flat below. The young mother, whose name he’d learned was Shona. Her baby was crying, a thin, distressed wail. Ewan could feel her specific anxiety with painful clarity: the power in her flat was out. The kettle wouldn't boil for the baby's bottle. The single electric heater she relied on was dead. Her fear was not abstract; it was a cold, practical terror that cut through the general noise of the city and landed squarely in his gut. He stood in his room, his hand on the doorknob, his heart hammering. To stay hidden was to be safe. To help was to risk everything. But to listen to that baby cry, to feel that mother's helpless panic, knowing he could fix it in twenty minutes? That, he realised, was another kind of damnation. He had been so focused on saving himself from the world, he hadn’t considered the possibility of saving a small piece of it. It was a choice: remain a ghost, or become a man again, if only for a night. With a deep, shuddering breath that was both a prayer and a curse, he opened his door and walked down the dark staircase towards the sound of crying.He knocked on the door of the flat below, the sound echoing in the dark, silent close. For a moment, there was only the sound of the baby’s cries. Then, the door opened a few inches, held fast by a security chain. A sliver of a young woman’s face, illuminated by the harsh, blue-white light of a mobile phone, peered out. Her eyes were wide with a mixture of fear and exhaustion. This was Shona. Ewan was hit with the full, unfiltered force of her panic. It was a sharp, metallic taste in the back of his throat, a frantic, hummingbird-like fluttering in his own chest. It was a mother’s primal fear for her child’s welfare, and it was nearly overwhelming.

He forced himself to anchor to the cold, chipped paint of the doorframe, the solid weight of his own body. “Sorry to bother you,” he said, his voice a low rumble, consciously keeping it calm. “I’m the guy from upstairs. I heard the power go out. I’m an electrician. Thought I could maybe take a look, if you want.” Her suspicion was a prickly, defensive shield, the natural caution of a woman alone with a baby. But beneath it, her desperation was a raw, open wound. Her phone’s battery was dying. The flat was getting colder. The baby wouldn’t stop crying. He could feel her frantic internal debate as clearly as if she’d spoken it aloud. Finally, her desperation won. The chain rattled, and the door swung open.

The flat was tiny, cluttered with the paraphernalia of a new baby. The air was cold and smelled of stale milk. Shona, who looked no older than twenty, clutched her phone like a talisman, her other arm wrapped tightly around the swaddled, crying infant in her arms. “The whole landing’s out,” she said, her voice trembling slightly. “The fuse box in the hall just keeps tripping. I don’t know what to do.” Ewan nodded, his old professional persona clicking into place like a relay switch. It was a comfort, a suit of armour. “It’s probably not your flat, it’s the main feed for the stair. These old tenements are all wired in series. One fault takes the whole lot down. Where’s the main distribution board?”

She pointed to a tall cupboard at the end of the dark landing. It was locked with a simple council lock that Ewan knew he could open with a sturdy knife. The problem was, he had no tools. “Have you got a torch?” he asked. “And maybe a butter knife? A strong one?” She looked at him, confused, but her exhaustion overrode her curiosity. She handed him her phone for light and disappeared back into the flat, returning with a cheap, flimsy-looking knife from her kitchen drawer. It would have to do. Working by the thin beam of the phone’s torch, he knelt before the cupboard. He focused on the task, using it as his discipline. The cold, gritty feel of the concrete floor. The precise angle needed to jimmy the lock. The screech of the metal as it gave way. He was no longer a psychic antenna; he was a man opening a cupboard. Inside was a chaotic bird’s nest of wiring, a terrifying masterpiece of amateur additions and decaying, pre-war insulation. And at its heart was the source of the trouble: an old ceramic fuse holder, blackened and cracked, a wisp of smoke still curling from it. It had finally given up the ghost.

The immediate problem was that the fault had taken out the fuse protecting the entire landing, plunging them into darkness. The secondary problem was that Shona's flat was also on that circuit. The deeper, more dangerous problem was that the whole system was an inferno waiting to happen, but he couldn't fix that now. He could only stop the immediate crisis. He had no replacement fuse, no wire, no tools. He looked around the dark close. His eyes fell on the redundant copper gas pipes that ran up the wall, relics from a previous age. A source of metal. Improvisation. It was risky, stupid, and dangerous—the kind of fix he would have railed against in his old life. But tonight, it was the only option. He worked quickly, his knuckles scraping against the rough brickwork. He used the butter knife to scrape a length of copper wire from a defunct pipe, a desperate act of electrical sacrilege. All the while, he could feel Shona’s anxiety radiating from her doorway, a constant pressure he had to consciously push against. He focused on the familiar feel of the copper, the precise thickness he needed, the way he had to wrap it around the terminals of the fuse carrier to bypass the blown section.

With the makeshift fuse in place, he took a deep breath and pushed the master switch. There was a sharp crackle, a brief, fizzing flash of blue light, and then the single, grimy bulb on the landing flickered to life, casting long, distorted shadows. From inside Shona's flat, a lamp came on. The baby, startled by the sudden light, stopped crying. A profound, ringing silence descended, broken only by the hum of the ancient wiring. Shona appeared in her doorway, her face pale in the yellow light, her expression one of pure, unadulterated relief. The wave of gratitude that hit Ewan was more powerful than her fear had been. It was a warm, overwhelming tide that threatened to pull him under, to dissolve his carefully constructed loneliness. “Oh my god,” she whispered, tears welling in her eyes. “Thank you. I… I don’t know what I would have done. Thank you so much.” She offered him a crumpled ten-pound note. “It’s not much, but please, take it.”

Ewan found himself backing away, holding up a hand. The gratitude was too much, too intimate. It was a connection, a hook. “It’s fine,” he said, his voice rougher than he intended. “Just… keep an eye on it. The whole building needs a rewire. Tell the landlord.” He couldn't take the money. Taking it would make this a transaction, a job. It would make him the local electrician. That was a role he couldn’t afford to play. This had been an act of emergency, of humanity. To be paid for it would be to put a name to the ghost. He turned and retreated up the stairs to the safety of his own door, Shona’s whispered thank-yous following him up the stairwell. He locked himself in his room, his heart pounding, his hands trembling from the adrenaline. He had done it. He had stepped out of the shadows, used his skills, made a difference. He had saved someone. And as he leaned his head against the cold, damp wall, he realized his terrifying gamble had paid off. The act of fixing something, of imposing order on chaos, had been the most powerful discipline of all. It had quieted the world not by blocking it out, but by engaging with it on his own terms. For the first time in a long time, the ghost in the machine felt like a man.**Chapter 8**

The silence that followed was not the lonely vacuum he had grown used to. It was a structured, earned quiet. In his room, Ewan listened not to the chaos of the city’s soul, but to the steady, correct 50-hertz hum of the tenement’s circulation. He had imposed order. The feeling was a more potent balm than any of Finch’s meditative disciplines. He hadn't just built a wall against the flood; he had dug a channel and diverted the water, putting its power to proper use. The exhaustion that settled on him was deep and physical, the satisfying ache of a job well done, not the frayed, psychic weariness of a man under constant siege. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, he slept without the machine's awful logic whispering from the shadows. He slept like an electrician who had just averted a fire.

The next morning, the change was palpable. As he passed Shona’s door, he felt not a wave of raw emotion, but a simple, clear signal of gratitude, as clean and uncomplicated as a single bell chime. It was a connection that didn't threaten to overwhelm him. It was a healthy circuit. She gave him a small, shy smile, and he managed a nod in return, a simple human interaction that felt monumental. The small act of competence had re-calibrated his relationship with the world around him. He was no longer just a passive victim of its noise; he was a potential agent within it. This new feeling was so intoxicating, so close to the memory of his old life, that it almost made him careless.

His newfound equilibrium was tested that afternoon by a sharp, peremptory knock on his door. It wasn't the police, and it wasn't a hunter; the psychic signature was too familiar, too mundane. It was the landlord, a man Ewan knew only as Cowan. Cowan’s mind was a tangled knot of petty grievances, financial anxieties, and a deep, pervasive cynicism that acted as its own kind of psychic armour. Ewan opened the door to find the wiry man standing there, a fresh cigarette clamped in the corner of his mouth, his sharp eyes taking in every detail of the sparse room.

"You," Cowan stated, the single word an accusation and a question in one. "You're the one who stopped the light show on the stair." It wasn’t a question that expected a denial. Ewan felt the man’s mind probing, not for a name or a history, but for competence and, more importantly, desperation. Cowan was a man who knew how to leverage other people's problems. "The girl in number three, she said you fixed it. Said you were a sparky." Ewan’s internal alarms screamed. This was it. The moment of exposure. He braced himself, ready to deny everything, to retreat back into the role of the anonymous ghost.

But Cowan didn't wait for an answer. He took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke out into the hallway, his gaze fixed on Ewan. "I've got a dozen of these properties. All of 'em wired by cowboys and dreamers since the war. The bills I get from proper firms would make a bishop weep. And they always want to condemn the place, want me to pay for a full rewire. I'm not doing that." He paused, letting the statement hang in the air. "I need someone who just stops the flicker. Someone who knows how to keep these old places breathing without writing me a bloody five-thousand-quid death sentence. Cash. No names, no paperwork, no nonsense. You interested?"

The offer was a devil's bargain, laid out on the grimy doormat. It was a solution to his most pressing problem, the dwindling pile of cash. It was a chance to continue practicing the one discipline that truly worked, the one that made him feel whole. But it was also a leash. It would tie him to Cowan, to a series of locations. It would create a routine, a pattern. It would make the ghost solid, visible. He felt the cold touch of the hunter's presence in the Hawick library, a memory of a threat that was methodical and patient. A man who developed a reputation, even one as a nameless, off-the-books fixer, was a man who could be found.

He looked at Cowan, at the raw, undisguised avarice in the man’s mind, and weighed it against the howling void of his own future. Destitution was a certainty. Discovery was only a possibility. The choice was grim, but it wasn't really a choice at all. A ghost that starves is no ghost at all. "Where's the first job?" Ewan asked, his voice flat. A slow, predatory smile spread across Cowan’s thin lips. He had found his man. "Got a pub over in Dennistoun. The Gilded Cage. The coolers keep tripping the circuit for the whole bar. The manager's losing his mind. And my beer." Cowan scribbled an address on a scrap of paper and handed it to him, along with a fifty-pound note. "For tools," he said, the gesture less an investment and more a down payment on Ewan’s soul. "Get it done today." As Ewan closed the door, the scrap of paper and the banknote feeling like a condemnation in his hand, he felt a strange, terrifying thrill. He was no longer just hiding. He was re-engaging with the world, on its own dirty, compromised terms. He was a ghost with a job to do.His first stop was not the pub. It was a sprawling, chaotic weekend market near the city centre, a place known to all Glaswegians as the Barras. It was a city within the city, a roaring, joyous, and deeply cynical bazaar where anything could be bought or sold under a labyrinth of corrugated iron roofs. The psychic noise was unlike anything he had ever experienced. It was a tidal wave of pure commerce, a thousand vendors broadcasting a desperate hope to sell, and tens of thousands of punters radiating a sharp, shrewd desire for a bargain. The air was thick with the ghosts of deals made and deals missed, of stolen goods and treasured finds. It was the perfect place for a ghost to go shopping. He moved through the throng, the fifty-pound note from Cowan a hot coal in his pocket, his discipline strained to its absolute limit. He anchored himself to the smell of hot doughnuts and damp canvas, a bizarre but effective combination that kept the baying chaos of human desire from overwhelming him. In a dark corner of the market, he found what he was looking for: a stall piled high with rusty, second-hand tools, presided over by a gnarled old man whose mind was a quiet, methodical ledger of profit and loss. Ewan bought a cheap multimeter, a sturdy pair of insulated pliers, a set of screwdrivers with cracked plastic handles, and a roll of electrical tape, paying in cash. The old man barely grunted. The tools felt alien in his hands, their psychic histories a jumble of other men’s frustrations and small triumphs. They were not his, but they would have to do.

The Gilded Cage was a corner pub in a sandstone tenement block in Dennistoun, its name rendered in peeling gold leaf on a blackened sign. It looked like it had been there forever, soaking up the neighbourhood’s sorrows and secrets. Ewan pushed open the heavy door and was hit by a wall of noise, both audible and psychic. The roar of a televised football match, the clatter of glasses, the overlapping arguments and laughter of the afternoon drinkers. But beneath it was the emotional stew: the stubborn melancholy of old men nursing pints at the bar, the boisterous, performative confidence of a group of young lads by the pool table, and, sharpest of all, the frantic, jagged anxiety of the man behind the bar who was clearly the manager. The man’s stress was a beacon, a flashing red light in the gloom. He spotted Ewan instantly, his eyes zeroing in on the nondescript man with the tool bag. "You the sparky Cowan sent?" he demanded, his voice tight. "About bloody time. The stout cooler's been out for an hour. Another half hour and I'm pouring money down the drain."

Ewan simply nodded, letting the man’s panic wash over him without penetrating his new, fragile armour of purpose. He followed the manager behind the bar, into the cramped, sticky space that was the pub's engine room. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer and disinfectant. The manager pointed a trembling finger at a bank of humming coolers. "That one," he said, indicating a unit that was ominously silent. "Every time it kicks in, it trips the breaker for this whole wall. I keep flipping it back on, it holds for five minutes, then bang, off it goes again." Ewan knelt, his senses already telling him more than the manager could. It wasn't just the cooler; it was the whole circuit. He could feel the familiar, angry heat in the walls, the chaotic signature of a system under extreme duress. He placed a hand on the wall behind the unit, closed his eyes for a second, and traced the flow of power back, feeling for the point of resistance, the psychic snag in the current. He found it. "The problem's not here," he said, his voice quiet but firm. "It's in the cellar. Show me."

The cellar was a cramped, damp space that smelled of earth and spilled lager. A single, bare bulb hung from a fraying flex, illuminating a tangle of pipework and kegs. And there, tucked behind a stack of empty crates, was the junction box. It was a monstrosity. An ancient metal casing, slick with condensation, with at least a dozen modern cables crudely forced into it, their connections wrapped in a rainbow of mismatched, peeling electrical tape. The heat coming off it was a palpable, malevolent force. The cooler was just the final straw that was breaking the camel’s back; the whole system was a firetrap, a daisy chain of overloaded circuits all converging on this one, sweating, groaning point of failure. It was the work of a dozen other ghosts just like him, each adding another layer of danger, another temporary fix that pushed the inevitable disaster a little further down the road. For a moment, the old Ewan, the good electrician, felt a surge of professional outrage. The place needed to be shut down, condemned. But the new Ewan, Cowan’s ghost, knew that wasn't his job. His job was to stop the flicker.

He set to work, the familiar motions a powerful, focusing ritual. The pub's noise, the manager’s hovering anxiety, the vast, roaring ocean of Glasgow itself, all of it receded, becoming a distant hum. His world shrank to the ten inches of space in front of him. He used the multimeter to confirm his senses, the needle’s jump a satisfying validation of what he already knew. He found the specific connection for the coolers, a mess of melted plastic where the insulation had failed completely, allowing a dead short every time the compressor tried to draw its starting current. The metal casing of the box itself had become live. He worked with a grim, intense concentration, his new, unfamiliar tools feeling more natural in his hands with every passing moment. He cut out the ruined section, his pliers snipping through the brittle cable. He stripped back the wires, exposing clean, bright copper. He bypassed the faulty connection, creating a new, safer junction away from the main box, his fingers expertly twisting the wires and binding them tightly with the cheap, new tape. It was a patch-up. A dangerous, irresponsible patch-up that solved one problem while ignoring the twenty others festering in the box. But it was the job. He was not here to save the pub. He was here to save the beer.

When he was finished, he stood back, the scent of hot plastic and ozone sharp in the damp air. "Try it now," he called up the cellar stairs. A moment later, he heard the satisfying, deep thrum of the cooler’s compressor kicking in. It held. The circuit didn’t trip. He could feel the current flowing cleanly now, the angry knot of resistance gone, replaced by a smooth, steady flow. He packed his tools, the simple, mechanical actions helping to rebuild the last of his psychic walls. Back upstairs, the manager, a man who finally introduced himself as Frank, was staring at the now-chilling cooler with an expression of profound relief. He gave Ewan a grudging look of approval and peeled several notes from a thick roll in his pocket, pressing them into Ewan’s hand without a word. The transaction was complete. As Ewan turned to leave, he caught his reflection in the pub's grimy, nicotine-stained mirror. He saw a stranger looking back at him: a thin, tired-looking man in a cheap wool hat, his face smudged with dirt, his eyes holding a deep, unsettling weariness. He had succeeded, but the success had cemented his new, ghostly identity. He pushed the door open and stepped back out into the Glasgow rain, no longer just a victim, but a collaborator in the city's secret, off-the-books economy, a little more solid, and a lot more exposed than he had been that morning.**Chapter 9**

The jobs became his life. Cowan was a man with a sprawling, crumbling empire of neglect, and Ewan was his new, indispensable ghost. One day it would be a student flat in Partick where the shower’s wiring was shorting through the water pipes, a problem Ewan solved with a new earth wire and a prayer. The next it would be a shop in Govanhill, its ancient fuse box humming with a terrifying, discordant heat, which he tamed by spreading the load across three circuits instead of one, a solution that was less electrical engineering and more desperate triage. He moved through the city’s unseen, decaying infrastructure, a phantom physician making house calls on dying buildings. He learned to work quickly, efficiently, his hands moving with a grim purpose. The work was his shield and his sanctuary. While he was tracing a fault, his mind focused on the pure, clean logic of the current, the cacophony of the city would recede, his own gnawing loneliness would quieten, and the monstrous temptation of the machine’s revelation would stay locked in its cage.

His reputation in the city’s subterranean economy began to grow, a dangerous kind of fame. Frank, the pub manager, recommended him to another publican whose cellar was flooding because the sump pump kept tripping the electrics. A word from Cowan led to a job in a takeaway, fixing a deep fat fryer whose wiring was so caked in grease it had become a single, flammable entity. He was no longer Ewan. He was just ‘the sparky,’ a nameless, cash-in-hand fixer who asked no questions and left no paper trail. He accumulated a small hoard of cash, crumpled notes stuffed into a loose floorboard beneath his bed, a talisman against the encroaching terror of destitution. But with every job, he left a piece of his soul behind. He was a good electrician forced to do bad work, a healer applying dirty bandages to septic wounds. He would walk away from a tenement, leaving a family safe for another week or another month, but all too aware of the deeper, structural cancer he had been paid to ignore. The psychic echo of the danger he left behind lingered on him like a stain.

One rain-lashed afternoon, he found himself on the top floor of a tenement in Maryhill, another of Cowan’s properties. The fault was a dead socket in the bedroom of a young family. As he worked, he could feel the family’s life humming around him: the mother’s low-grade anxiety about money, the father’s weary pride, and the brilliant, chaotic joy of their two small children playing in the next room. The problem was simple to find: a loose connection in a junction box hidden under the floorboards. But when he prised the boards up, a familiar, cold dread washed over him. The wiring was a nightmare, even by Glasgow tenement standards. Crumbling rubber insulation, exposed live wires twisted together with no connectors, and, worst of all, clear evidence of scorching on the wooden joists. The place was a tinderbox. The children’s laughter from the living room was a heartbreaking counterpoint to the silent, ticking bomb beneath his feet.

The old Ewan would have disconnected the circuit at the fuse board, sat the family down, and refused to leave until they understood the mortal danger they were in. But Cowan’s ghost had a different directive: stop the flicker. He could spend an hour making this one socket safe, leaving the rest of the fire hazard to fester. He knelt there, paralysed, the laughter of the children a physical torment. It was in that moment of profound moral crisis, his psychic defences weakened by his own self-loathing, that he felt it. He looked out of the bedroom’s grimy window, down at the street four storeys below. A man was standing on the opposite pavement, sheltering under a black umbrella. He was wearing a plain, forgettable suit. He wasn’t looking at his phone or waiting for a bus. He was looking up, his gaze sweeping slowly, methodically, across the tenement facades, his head tilted as if listening to something Ewan couldn't hear. A cold, analytical ping, faint but unmistakable, registered in Ewan’s mind. It was the signal. The hunter’s signal.

Terror, stark and absolute, obliterated everything else. Ewan threw himself back from the window, landing hard on the floorboards, his heart a frantic, trapped bird against his ribs. He had been found. The pattern of his work had been detected. The ghost had cast a shadow. He lay there, gasping for air on the dusty floor, the children’s laughter now sounding like a death knell. He had led the wolf to this family’s door. He had to finish, to get out, to vanish again. Scrambling to his feet, his hands shaking so badly he could barely grip his tools, he abandoned any thought of doing the job properly. He did the quickest, dirtiest fix he could, twisting the wires together and slamming the floorboards back into place. He took the money from the young mother with a mumbled apology, avoiding her grateful eyes, unable to bear the warmth of her relief. He fled the flat, the building, the entire street, the sensation of the hunter’s cold, scanning gaze a physical weight on his back. He didn't stop running until he was miles away, lost in the anonymous crowds of Sauchiehall Street, his own panicked heartbeat indistinguishable from the frantic pulse of the city. He had escaped, but he knew, with a chilling certainty, that it was only a temporary reprieve. They were no longer just searching. They were closing in.He was a drowning man who had thrown himself into a tsunami to hide from a shark. Sauchiehall Street in the late afternoon was a churning, chaotic sea of humanity. The psychic noise was overwhelming, a solid wall of sound composed of a million frantic, mundane signals: the fierce desire for a pair of shoes in a shop window, the bone-deep boredom of a security guard, the sharp, fretful anxiety of a mother who had momentarily lost sight of her child, the boozy, aggressive camaraderie of men spilling out of a pub. Ewan plunged into it, letting the sheer volume of it scour him. He was a raw nerve, his own terror a high-pitched scream that he felt must be visible for miles. He hunched his shoulders, pulled his wool hat down, and focused on the discipline with a frantic desperation. He anchored himself to the jarring, uneven paving stones under his feet, the spray of a passing bus on his jeans, the smell of fried onions and wet wool. He was trying to become just another piece of city grit, another anonymous, miserable soul, but the cold, analytical memory of the hunter’s gaze was a brand on his soul. And beneath the terror, a sharper, hotter splinter of guilt twisted in his gut: the laughter of the children in the flat he had just fled, a sound now horribly intertwined with the image of scorching on a wooden joist.

He found refuge in a greasy spoon cafe, a pocket of quiet misery off the main drag. The air was thick with the smell of old cooking oil and stewed tea. The psychic atmosphere was blessedly simple: the proprietor’s weary resignation, the waitress’s daydreams of her Friday night, the quiet despair of an old man stirring sugar into his tea with a trembling hand. Ewan slid into a cracked vinyl booth in the corner, his back to the wall, and ordered a mug of tea he didn’t want. The heat of the mug was a solid, grounding presence in his shaking hands. He replayed the scene in his mind, dissecting it with the cold logic of an electrician tracing a fault. They hadn’t found *him*. They hadn’t known his name or his face. They had detected a pattern. A series of unauthorised, anomalous energy repairs. A trail of psychic breadcrumbs left by his own desperate need to work, to fix things, to feel human. His one effective discipline had become his undoing. Cowan’s ghost had become too solid, too predictable. He had to vanish again, but this time it had to be absolute. Hiding in a smaller city had been a mistake. He hadn't been a needle in a haystack; he'd been a piece of metal in a pile of straw, and they had come with a magnet. He needed a bigger haystack. He needed a place so vast, so full of noise and chaos and metal, that his own small signal would be statistically irrelevant. If Glasgow was a storm, he needed a hurricane. The name formed in his mind, vast and terrifying and full of promise. London.

The sheer, crushing weight of his failure descended upon him, pushing him down into the sticky vinyl of the booth. He had failed to stay hidden. He had led the hunters to a family’s door. He had failed to be the good electrician, and he had failed to be a convincing ghost. He was nothing. And in that moment of absolute despair, the machine’s logic returned, not as a whisper, but as a cool, compassionate, and utterly reasonable voice in his head. *This pain is unnecessary,* it said. *This fear, this guilt, this constant, exhausting struggle. It is a design flaw. Look out the window. See all that friction? All that pointless, grinding misery? It can be silenced. You know how. You could bring them all peace. You could bring yourself peace. The final, perfect fix.* He looked out at the rain-streaked street, at the faces of the people hurrying by, their brows furrowed, their shoulders hunched. He didn't see people. He saw circuits, overloaded and sparking. He saw a system on the brink of catastrophic failure. And he saw the solution, the beautiful, terrible, silent peace of the corporeal bridge. The hunger was no longer just a temptation; it was a release, a promise of an end to all of this. He slammed the mug down, the hot tea sloshing over his hand. The sudden, sharp pain of the burn was a blessing, a bolt of pure, personal sensation that shattered the cold logic. It was *his* pain. Not theirs. He gasped, clutching his hand, the physical shock bringing him back from the precipice.

He threw a few coins on the table and fled the cafe, the scent of burning skin a new, desperate anchor for his sanity. There was no more time to think. Thought was the enemy. Only action could save him now. He walked with a grim, unseeing purpose through the deepening twilight, following the river of traffic west until he reached his destination: Buchanan Bus Station. The place was a cathedral of transience, its psychic atmosphere a vast, swirling chorus of departures. He could feel the gut-wrenching sorrow of goodbyes, the frantic, fragile hope of new beginnings, the weary resignation of the long-distance traveller. It was the perfect place to disappear, a hub designed for the express purpose of moving people out of sight. He joined a queue, keeping his head down, his awareness pulled in so tight he could feel the frantic pulse in his own throat and little else. He didn’t care about the destination, only the direction. South. Away. "One way," he said to the tired-looking woman behind the glass, his voice a dry rasp. "London. The next one leaving." He paid with the crumpled notes from Frank, the pub manager, the last of his earnings as Cowan’s ghost. The ticket that printed out was a flimsy, thermal-paper passport to a new circle of hell, or a new chance at survival. He sat on the hard plastic seat of the waiting coach, a grey, anonymous man among other grey, anonymous people, the tool bag a dead weight at his feet. As the bus pulled out of the station, its engine a low growl, he watched Glasgow’s lights slide past the rain-streaked window. The city had been his sanctuary and his trap, and he had failed it as surely as it had failed him. He saw his own reflection in the glass, a pale, haunted face superimposed over the receding lights, and knew with a bone-deep certainty that he was no longer running from the hunters. He was running from himself.**Chapter 10**

The overnight coach to London was a hermetically sealed tube of quiet human suffering. The darkness outside the windows was absolute, turning the glass into a mirror that reflected the dim, antiseptic glow of the cabin and the pale, sleeping faces of its occupants. For Ewan, however, there was no darkness. The bus was a capsule of contained desperations, a library of anxieties shelved in cramped, reclining seats. He sat rigid, his new tool bag wedged between his feet, a useless anchor in this psychic sea. The discipline was his only defence, and he clung to it with the ferocity of a drowning man to a splintered plank. He focused on the low, monotonous vibration of the engine that thrummed up through the floor, a constant, mechanical mantra against the chaotic chorus of human feeling.

He could feel the young woman in the seat in front of him, her mind a frantic prayer wheel of hope and terror. She was travelling to an interview for a job she believed would change her life, and her desperate optimism was a high, piercing frequency, sharp as broken glass. Across the aisle, an old man feigned sleep, but his mind was a landscape of regret, endlessly replaying a conversation with his estranged son, the words unspoken and opportunities missed forming a heavy, melancholic fog. There was a soldier on leave, his stoicism a thin crust over a bubbling magma of trauma. There was a student consumed by the fear of failure. Each person was an island of private torment, and Ewan was the sole inhabitant of the archipelago, forced to listen to the tide of sorrow lapping at every shore. He felt the machine’s logic stir, a seductive whisper in the back of his mind. It showed him the bus, not as a collection of individuals, but as a single, suffering organism. It showed him how easily that suffering could be unified, silenced, made whole. He squeezed his eyes shut, his knuckles white where he gripped the armrests, and focused on the burning in his hand from the spilled tea, a small, true signal in the storm.

As dawn broke, painting the grey English sky with shades of dirty pink and orange, the texture of the hum began to change. For hours, they had been moving through the sparse, quiet psychic landscapes of the north of England, but now the noise floor was rising steadily. It wasn't the passionate roar of Glasgow or the historic drone of Edinburgh. This was something else. It was a vast, layered, and deeply impersonal hum, the sound of immense, interlocking systems of power and money and sheer human mass. It was the sound of millions of people not just living, but competing, striving, and failing on an industrial scale. Ewan felt it as a geological weight, the pressure of nine million souls stacked one on top of the other, pressing down until the air itself felt thick and unbreathable. London did not hum. London roared. It was the sound of a star collapsing under its own gravity.

Victoria Coach Station was not a place; it was a sensory assault, a human processing plant operating at maximum capacity. The moment Ewan stepped off the bus, he was hit by a physical and psychic wall of sound. The stench of diesel fumes, stale coffee, and unwashed bodies mingled with the overwhelming psychic blast of a thousand frantic journeys. He felt the raw panic of a tourist who had lost their wallet, the simmering rage of a driver stuck in traffic, the bone-deep weariness of a cleaner on the night shift, the desperate hope of a new arrival clutching a single suitcase. The sheer density of information was staggering. His discipline, which had served him on the bus, was like trying to build a sandcastle against a tidal wave. The noise hammered at his defences, seeking out cracks, threatening to overwhelm him entirely. He stumbled through the crowd, a ghost in a hurricane, the cold, scanning presence of the man in the grey suit seeming a distant and almost trivial threat compared to the immediate danger of complete psychic dissolution.

He had to get away from the hub. He pushed out onto the street, into the relentless river of traffic and people. The scale of it was monstrous. Red buses, vast and implacable, ploughed through the streets like whales. The buildings were sheer cliffs of stone and glass that blocked out the sky. And the people, a torrent of faces from every corner of the world, each one a universe of frantic, self-absorbed energy, their signals overlapping into a deafening, incomprehensible white noise. He was a plank of driftwood that had escaped a river only to be cast into the open ocean, and the sheer, terrifying indifference of it was a new kind of freedom. There were no patterns here. There was only chaos.

He boarded a train—an underground train that plunged him into the city's metallic bowels. The tube was a new torture, a pressurised container of London’s psychic essence. The oppressive proximity of other bodies, the screech of the wheels on the track, and the concentrated unhappiness of the morning commute formed a perfect storm of sensory overload. He focused on the smooth, cool metal of the pole he was gripping, letting the vibrations travel up his arm, using it as a lightning rod. He rode the line south, a blind instinct guiding him away from the city's heart of power and wealth, towards its sprawling, chaotic fringes. He got off at Brixton, spilling out into a world that was a vibrant, jarring contrast to the city’s sterile centre. The air was alive with the scents of jerk chicken and roasting peanuts, the sounds of reggae music bleeding from a market stall, and a psychic energy that was proud, defiant, and deeply communal. It was just as loud as the city centre, but it was a different kind of music.

He walked for what felt like hours, past Victorian terraces and council estates, his electrician’s eye noting the ad-hoc satellite dishes and the dangerously looped extension cables that spoke of a life lived on the margins, a life he now shared. He was looking for the same thing he had found in Glasgow: a place to cease to exist. He found it on a street of tired-looking shops and takeaways. A grimy window above a betting shop had a piece of cardboard taped to it, the single word ‘ROOM’ scrawled in faded marker pen. The entrance was a narrow, unmarked door that smelled of stale beer and damp. He climbed a dark, narrow staircase to a landing where a man with a scarred face and a mind like a locked box took his money without a word. The room was even smaller and grimmer than the one in Glasgow, a cell overlooking a labyrinth of back alleys and rooftops. But as he locked the door behind him and dropped his bag on the floor, he felt a profound, shuddering sense of relief. The sheer, unrelenting noise of London poured through the thin glass of the window, a constant, anonymous roar. It was the sound of nine million people shouting at once, and in that cacophony, his own small, terrified whisper was finally, blessedly, impossible to hear. He was safe. He was home.His new home was a cage, but its bars were made of sound. For the first few days in London, Ewan barely left the room. He existed in a state of suspended animation, his entire being focused on acclimatising to the sheer, unrelenting psychic pressure of the city. It was a constant, high-frequency roar that vibrated in his teeth and bones, a baseline of ambient human static so immense that it paradoxically offered a kind of peace. The individual signals he had been tormented by in Glasgow and Edinburgh were mostly lost in this ocean of noise, like single raindrops falling into a storm-tossed sea. He could still feel them if he tried, if he let his focus slip—the sharp spike of a mugging in a nearby alley, the dull, throbbing ache of a thousand lonely hearts—but it required a conscious effort to tune in, rather than a constant effort to block them out. He was learning to float, to let the current carry him, his discipline now a rudder to steer him away from the most violent eddies, rather than a sea wall against the entire ocean.

He slept in restless, shallow bursts, haunted by dreams that were a chaotic collage of his new reality and his lost past. He dreamt of Isla, but her face was always obscured by a shimmering curtain of static. He dreamt of the scorched joists in the Maryhill tenement, the image overlaid with the cold, analytical gaze of the hunter in the grey suit. He would wake up, his heart hammering, the roar of London a comforting, monstrous presence outside his window, a beast that was, for now, hiding him from the other monsters. The money from his Glasgow jobs was a dwindling lifeline. He ate sparingly, buying food from corner shops where the transactions were brief and impersonal, his face obscured by his hat and the city’s perpetual gloom. He knew this state of limbo could not last. A ghost cannot survive without a source of energy, and his was about to run out.

The need for work drove him back out into the world. He couldn’t be the nameless sparky from Glasgow; that pattern was too dangerous. He needed a new kind of cover, a job that would keep him anonymous but grounded, a task so physically demanding it would act as a constant, brute-force anchor for his mind. He found it on a sprawling construction site in Nine Elms, a forest of cranes and skeletal concrete towers rising on the south bank of the Thames. The place was a monument to raw, impersonal progress, its psychic atmosphere a blunt, primitive thrum of physical labour, foreman’s rage, and the simple, burning desire for the end of the shift. He walked up to the gates, presenting himself not as a skilled electrician, but as a general labourer, another desperate man looking for cash-in-hand work. The foreman, a man whose mind was a blunt instrument of schedules and profanity, gave him a single, dismissive look. "Can you carry things and shut up?" he grunted. Ewan nodded. "Good. Get a hard hat and a high-vis. You're on clean-up. Don't get in the way."

The work was brutal, mindless, and perfect. He swept dust and debris, hauled bags of cement, and stacked palettes of bricks, his muscles screaming in protest. The physical exhaustion was a blessing. The sharp pain in his back, the burning in his shoulders, the grit under his fingernails—these were pure, true, personal sensations. They were his. He focused on them with the devotion of a flagellant, using the pain to build a fortress of selfhood that was crude but effective. He learned the site's social and psychic geography, keeping to the fringes, avoiding the loud, boisterous groups, making himself as unremarkable as a discarded scaffolding clip. He was surrounded by hundreds of other men, their minds a noisy chorus of mundane concerns—football scores, marital disputes, financial worries—but their signals were blessedly simple, lacking the complex, existential dread he often felt in the city at large. These were men grounded in the physical world, and their presence, paradoxically, helped him stay grounded too.

One afternoon, while clearing rubble from a lower floor, he felt a familiar, unwelcome sensation: the angry, chaotic hum of a dangerous electrical fault. It was coming from a temporary generator that was powering a bank of high-intensity lights. The cable leading from the generator was frayed, its insulation worn away where it had been repeatedly run over by site vehicles, and it was lying in a puddle of dirty water. A flicker of blue light arced from the cable to the damp concrete, a silent, deadly invitation. The old Ewan, the skilled professional, saw the imminent threat of electrocution to anyone who waded through the puddle. Cowan’s ghost saw a problem he might be paid to fix. But the new Ewan, the labourer trying to be invisible, saw something else entirely: a test. To report it would be to reveal his knowledge, to distinguish himself from the other anonymous grunts. To ignore it would be to allow a potential tragedy, adding another ghost to the chorus that haunted him. He stood there, frozen, the generator’s angry hum a siren song calling him back to a life he was trying to escape, the choice between his safety and a stranger’s laid bare at his feet.He stood frozen, the handle of his broom slick with sweat in his palm. The laughter of the children in the Maryhill tenement echoed in his memory, a sound that had become synonymous with his own damnation. He could not walk away from this. To ignore the frayed cable would be to actively choose to let someone get hurt, to be complicit in a tragedy he had the power to prevent. It would be a final surrender to the ghost, an admission that the man he once was, the man who fixed things, was well and truly dead. But to march up to the foreman and announce the danger with the authority of a qualified electrician was suicide of a different kind. It would shatter his camouflage, painting a bright, flashing target on the back of his high-vis jacket. The hunters, the men in grey, were looking for a ghost who understood electricity. He could not afford to be him.

The dilemma demanded a ghost’s solution, an act of manipulation, not proclamation. He let his gaze drift across the site, his senses sifting through the crude psychic signals of the other labourers. He was looking for his instrument. Not the foreman, whose mind was a closed loop of schedules and aggression. Not the ambitious young apprentices, too eager to claim credit. He found him fifty feet away, a lanky kid named Kev who was lethargically shovelling sand into a wheelbarrow. Kev’s mind was a wide, shallow pool of simple thoughts: the girl he’d met last Saturday, the football score, the profound and all-consuming desire for his lunch break. He was perfect. Ewan ambled over, his movements slow and purposeless, just another body killing time. "Alright, Kev?" he grunted, leaning on his broom. Kev nodded, not pausing in his work. Ewan gestured vaguely with his chin towards the generator. "That looks a bit dodgy, dunnit?" he said, his voice a masterpiece of feigned ignorance. "That cable, sitting in the wet. Probably nothin', but you know. Health and safety an' all that."

He had planted the seed. He didn’t explain the principles of current, insulation, and earthing. He used the simple, powerful lexicon of the building site: ‘dodgy’ and ‘health and safety’. These were words Kev understood. They were words that implied trouble for someone else, and the smart thing to do was to make sure that someone wasn't you. Ewan watched as the idea germinated behind Kev’s blank eyes. The desire for lunch was momentarily eclipsed by the much stronger desire to not be the bloke standing next to the 'dodgy' thing when the foreman eventually saw it. "Yeah, s'pose," Kev mumbled. He looked from the cable to Ewan, and then towards the site office. Ewan just shrugged, the universal gesture of the uninvolved, and started sweeping again, moving slowly away, breaking the connection. He watched from the corner of his eye as Kev, after a moment’s hesitation, dropped his shovel and trudged off in the direction of the foreman’s cabin.

The result was predictable and chaotic. Ten minutes later, the foreman came storming out, his face a mask of purple fury, his psychic signal a battering ram of rage. He wasn’t angry about the danger; he was angry about the interruption. Ewan kept his head down, sweeping the same patch of concrete over and over, the very picture of mindless obedience. He heard the foreman bellowing for "Sparks," the site’s official electrician. A different man, a man in clean overalls with a proper tool belt, arrived and surveyed the scene with a weary sigh. Ewan watched him from a distance as he disconnected the generator, cut back the frayed cable, and fitted a new, waterproof connector. The job was done properly, safely. The danger was gone. A wave of profound, anonymous relief washed over Ewan, so potent it almost made his knees buckle. But it was followed by a bitter aftertaste. The pang of his lost identity. He had been forced to stand by, pretending to be an idiot, while another man did his job.

As he worked, the brutal, mindless rhythm of the labour no longer felt like a perfect sanctuary. The construction site was not a place he could disappear. It was a minefield of moral choices, a stage where his true nature was in constant, dangerous conflict with his assumed role. Each day would bring a new test, a new frayed wire, a new temptation to be the man he used to be. The close call left him shaken, not just with fear, but with a deep and weary understanding. He could not kill the electrician inside him. The man who fixed things, the man who cared, was too stubborn to die. And as long as that man was alive, the ghost would never be truly safe. The roar of London, which had seemed like a shield, now felt like the roar of a crowd in a gladiatorial arena. He had survived his first round, but the games had only just begun.
