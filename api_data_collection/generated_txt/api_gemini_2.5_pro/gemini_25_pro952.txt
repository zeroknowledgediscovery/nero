The separation agreement sat on Eleanor Vance’s desk like a dead thing. Its fifty-seven pages, replete with sub-clauses and addendums, detailed the precise and unromantic vivisection of a twenty-year marriage. The assets were considerable, the acrimony more so. Eleanor’s job was to ensure the latter didn’t completely poison the division of the former. She was good at it. She was good at building walls of legal jargon, at caulking the cracks of human emotion with the dry plaster of precedent and statutory obligation. Her billable hours were a monument to her efficiency.

From her twelfth-floor office, she could see the perpetual motion of Coquitlam Centre’s parking lot, the distant green smudge of the Eagle Ridge foothills, and the thin silver line of the SkyTrain gliding towards the city. It was an orderly view. Predictable. Cars found their spaces, the mountains stayed put, the train ran on time. It was the kind of world Eleanor had meticulously constructed for herself, both inside her corner office and out. Her days were partitioned into six-minute billing increments, her weekends were for meal-prepping and spin classes, her emotions were filed away under ‘Pending’ and rarely, if ever, revisited.

Today, the Chong-Peterson file was particularly tedious. Mr. Peterson was claiming emotional distress over the loss of a ceramic garden gnome he asserted Mrs. Chong had ‘maliciously purloined’. Mrs. Chong, through her counsel, retorted that the gnome had been a gift from her mother and was, in any case, aesthetically displeasing. Eleanor had already spent three billable hours drafting a response concerning the gnome, a response that used the words ‘chattel’, ‘provenance’, and ‘amicable resolution’ and felt, to her, like a quiet scream into the void.

She initialled the bottom of a page, her pen a neat, black slash. It was almost six. The sun, low and golden, was beginning to glint off the windscreens of the cars below, turning the parking lot into a field of tiny, dazzling explosions. Time to go home. Time to trade the dead marriage of Chong-Peterson for the sterile quiet of her own condo. She packed her briefcase, the latches clicking shut with satisfying finality. The gnome, she decided, would have to wait until morning. Some battles were not worth the overtime.

Instead of heading straight to her car, she took the long way, walking towards the small, man-made pond that served as the cosmetic centerpiece of the business park complex. A little patch of curated nature to offset the concrete and glass. She often did this after a difficult day, a small ritual to decompress, to watch the water ripple and pretend her thoughts could do the same—disperse, soften, fade at the edges. The air was cool, smelling of damp earth and car exhaust. A few office workers were scattered on benches, scrolling on their phones, their faces bathed in blue light.

And that’s when she saw it.

It was a mallard, a drake, standing on the manicured grass at the edge of the concrete path. It wasn't doing anything. It wasn't quacking or waddling or seeking breadcrumbs. It was just standing there, preternaturally still, its emerald head shimmering with an oily, impossible luminescence in the dying light. Its eye, a black, unblinking bead, was fixed on her.

Eleanor stopped. The sound of her sensible heels on the pavement seemed offensively loud. The world narrowed to the space between her and the duck. It wasn't fear, not at first. It was a profound and unsettling sense of being *seen*. The duck’s gaze was not the vacant, instinct-driven stare of an animal. It felt ancient, intelligent, and deeply, deeply judgmental. It was as if this small, feathered creature had access to every file in her mental cabinet—every compromised ideal, every white lie, every shirked responsibility, the ghost of the gnome. It knew about the time she’d pretended not to see her elderly neighbour struggling with his groceries. It knew she hadn’t called her mother back. It knew, with the cold certainty of a god, that she was a fraud.

Her heart began to hammer against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. The air grew thick, heavy, pressing in on her. The duck’s stillness became a coiled threat, its silence a condemnation. The smooth, rounded shape of its beak seemed suddenly, horribly wrong—a weapon designed for some unspeakable purpose. It shifted its weight, a minuscule movement, and a sound escaped Eleanor's throat, a dry little gasp. She felt a primal, gut-wrenching certainty that if she didn't run, the duck would do something. Not attack her, not in a way anyone else would understand. It would… unravel her. It would quack, and the sound would peel the skin from her bones.

She turned, her movements jerky and uncoordinated, and fled. She didn’t look back. She half-ran, half-stumbled through the business park, her briefcase banging against her leg, the click-clack of her heels a frantic message in Morse code: *panic-panic-panic*. She didn't slow until she was in the concrete echo chamber of the parkade, fumbling for her car keys, her breath coming in ragged sobs. She threw her briefcase onto the passenger seat, slammed the door, and locked it. Only then did she let her head fall against the steering wheel, her carefully constructed world nothing more than a pile of rubble around her feet. It was just a duck. A perfectly ordinary, non-threatening, web-footed waterfowl. And it had broken her.

The phone rang later that evening, piercing the tomb-like silence of her apartment. Caller ID showed a picture of her mother, smiling beside a prize-winning rose bush. Eleanor let it ring four times before answering, composing her voice into something resembling normalcy.

“Hi, Mom.”

“Eleanor, darling. You didn’t call me back.” Her mother’s voice was a brisk, no-nonsense breeze from the Okanagan. “I was just calling to see if you were dead in a ditch.” It was her standard opening, a joke that had long ago lost its humour.

“Sorry, Mom. It was a long day. We’re litigating over a garden gnome.”

“A gnome? Goodness. Are you eating properly? You sound peaky.”

Eleanor hesitated. She swirled the ice in her glass of water, watching the cubes clink together. Should she say it? Could she? How do you tell your ruthlessly pragmatic mother that you’ve become unhinged by a duck?

“Actually, something strange happened today,” she began, her voice small.

“Oh?”

“I was walking home. By that pond near the office. And there was a duck.” She paused, waiting for a response that didn’t come. “It just… looked at me. And I had this… this feeling. I panicked, Mom. I had to run away. I felt like I couldn’t breathe.”

There was a long silence on the other end of the line, filled only by a faint static. Eleanor could picture her mother perfectly: standing in her immaculate kitchen, one eyebrow raised, a dishtowel in her hand.

“A duck,” her mother said, her voice flat. Not a question, but a statement of incredulous fact.

“Yes.”

“An ordinary duck?”

“I think so. It had a green head.”

“Eleanor, for heaven’s sake. You’re working too hard. It’s this gnome business. It’s scrambling your brain. You’re probably anemic. I’m going to send you some iron supplements. Ducks are harmless. They’re floating loaves of bread with heads.”

“No, this was different. It felt…” Eleanor trailed off, the words feeling foolish and flimsy even to her. “It felt malevolent.”

“Malevolent,” her mother repeated, and this time she didn’t bother to hide the laugh in her voice. “Darling, you’re a thirty-four-year-old corporate lawyer. You eviscerate people for a living. You are not going to be taken down by a ‘malevolent’ duck. Get a good night’s sleep. And for God’s sake, book a vacation.” The line clicked, leaving Eleanor holding a dead phone and a brand new, utterly humiliating secret. Her own mother thought she was ridiculous. A fresh wave of shame washed over her, cold and sharp. She was ridiculous.

The next day, she called in sick. It was the first time in four years. She cited a migraine, a plausible and un-questionable ailment. In truth, she spent the day in a state of low-grade terror. She kept the blinds closed. Her apartment, usually a sanctuary of clean lines and muted colours, felt like a cage. She tried to work on the Chong-Peterson file from home but found herself unable to concentrate. The word ‘chattel’ kept morphing into ‘mallard’. She found herself staring at the fine print of her own lease, a document she had drafted herself, scanning for any clauses pertaining to the keeping of birds on the property. There were none. It felt like a shocking oversight.

By late afternoon, she couldn't take the silence anymore. She called Maya.

Maya was a whirlwind contained in a human body. A sculptor who worked with scrap metal and a part-time kickboxing instructor, she was Eleanor’s opposite in every conceivable way, and her closest friend since they’d been randomly assigned as roommates in their first year at UBC.

“Ellie-Bellie! Playing hooky? I’m shocked. Did the law finally bore you to death?” Maya’s voice was a cheerful boom over the phone.

“Can you come over?” Eleanor asked, her voice tight. “And maybe bring wine?”

“That is the most alluring invitation I’ve had all week. Is this a fun, gossip-and-get-drunk visit, or a grim, somebody-died-and-we-need-to-hide-the-body visit? I need to dress accordingly.”

“I don’t know what it is,” Eleanor admitted. “Grim-adjacent, maybe.”

An hour later, Maya barrelled through the door, a bottle of cheap, robust red in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar chips in the other. She was wearing paint-splattered overalls over a fluorescent pink tank top, her hair a chaotic pile of curls held back by a stray chopstick. She took one look at Eleanor, who was still in the pyjamas she’d been wearing for twenty-four hours, and her jovial expression softened.

“Whoa. Okay. Grim it is.” She deposited her offerings on the granite countertop and pulled Eleanor into a hug that smelled faintly of welding fumes and turpentine. Eleanor, who was not a hugger, found herself leaning into it, her body rigid with tension.

“Talk to me,” Maya said, pouring a generous amount of wine into a water glass because she couldn’t be bothered to find the wine glasses. “What’s up? Did the gnomes unionize?”

Sitting on her beige linen sofa, a glass of too-sweet red in her trembling hand, Eleanor told her. She told her everything. The stillness of the duck, the judgmental eye, the certainty of her own fraudulence, the panicked flight, the mortifying phone call with her mother. She laid it all out, the absurd, shameful confession, fully expecting Maya to laugh. She braced herself for it.

Maya listened, her head tilted, her expression uncharacteristically serious. She crunched a chip, the sound like a gunshot in the quiet room. When Eleanor finished, her voice a thin whisper, Maya was silent for a long moment.

“So let me get this straight,” she said finally, her voice low. “You’ve developed a sudden, soul-crushing phobia of… ducks.”

Eleanor nodded, staring at her lap, unable to meet her friend’s eyes. “It sounds insane. I know it’s insane.”

“Anatidaephobia,” Maya said, matter-of-factly.

Eleanor looked up. “What?”

“Anatidaephobia. The fear that somewhere, somehow, a duck is watching you. It’s a real thing. I saw it on a documentary once. Some guy had it. He couldn’t go near ponds. Or pictures of ponds. Or even eat at Chinese restaurants. You know, peking duck and all that.”

Eleanor stared at her. A real thing. It had a name. It wasn’t just her. A tiny, fragile sliver of relief pierced through the thick fog of her anxiety. “Really?”

“Totally. Look, is it weird? Yeah. It’s objectively bizarre, El. But you’re properly terrified. I can see it. Your hands are shaking.” Maya reached out and put her calloused, paint-stained hand over Eleanor’s. Her grip was firm, grounding. “So, screw your mom. And screw that duck. If you’re scared of ducks, then you’re scared of ducks. It’s a thing now.”

“But what do I do?” Eleanor’s voice cracked. “My office is surrounded by them. Coquitlam is full of lakes. Lafarge Lake, Como Lake… they’re everywhere, Maya. It’s like the whole world has suddenly become hostile territory.”

Maya took a long sip of her wine, her brow furrowed in thought. “Okay. Operation Decoy. First, we figure out your triggers. Is it all birds? Or just the quacky bastards?”

“Just… them. The ducks.”

“Right. Good. Specificity is good. We can work with that. We need to create a duck-free life for you until you figure this out.” Maya’s eyes lit up with the fire of a new project. For a sculptor who built eight-foot-tall robots out of discarded washing machines, this was just a different kind of logistical problem. “We’ll map out safe routes for you to get to work. I’ll be your official duck-scout. We’ll get you blackout blinds. We’ll screen your television shows for any rogue waterfowl. David Attenborough is officially proscribed.”

A small, watery laugh escaped Eleanor’s lips. It was the first time she had felt anything other than terror or shame in two days. “You’re serious.”

“As serious as a heart attack,” Maya said, crunching another chip. “You’re my best friend. Your brain decided to go haywire and pick the stupidest possible thing to be afraid of. My job is not to judge the haywire. My job is to bring the wine and help you build a duck-proof bunker. Now, drink up. We’ve got strategic planning to do.”

As the evening wore on, and the wine bottle emptied, Eleanor felt a strange sense of calm settle over her. The fear was still there, a cold stone in the pit of her stomach, but it was no longer screaming. Maya, with her absurd, unwavering loyalty, had built a thin but sturdy wall around it. They did, in fact, map out a new route to her office on Google Maps, one that studiously avoided all visible bodies of water, even ornamental fountains. It added fifteen minutes to her commute, a small price to pay for peace of mind. For the first time, Eleanor Vance, the woman who planned everything, had to surrender control. Her life, for the foreseeable future, was in the hands of a chaotic artist with a penchant for solving problems with brute force and boundless enthusiasm. It was a terrifying thought. But as she watched Maya sketch out a diagram of a potential ‘commuter-shield’ made from a golf umbrella and some cardboard, she also realized it was the only thing keeping her from dissolving completely. The world was still a minefield, but at least now, she had a minesweeper.**Chapter 1**

The next morning, Eleanor woke not to the gentle, pre-programmed chimes of her alarm, but to the frantic thumping of her own heart. For a disoriented moment, she didn’t know why. The room was dark, the blackout blinds Maya had insisted upon holding the grey dawn at bay. Then it came back to her in a sickening rush: the emerald head, the unblinking eye, the crushing weight of its judgment. The duck. The fear was a physical thing, a cold weight in her stomach. Her apartment, once a haven of predictable order, now felt thin-walled and vulnerable, a flimsy fortress against a feathered siege she alone could perceive. The silence wasn’t peaceful anymore; it was expectant.

Getting ready for work was a disjointed, clumsy affair. She nearly dropped her toothbrush, her hand shaking as she brought it to her mouth. She chose her suit—a charcoal grey, severe and armour-like—as if its sharp tailoring could protect her. As she forced down a piece of dry toast, she reviewed the map Maya had texted her in the middle of the night, a mess of highlighted yellow lines on a screenshot. ‘OPERATION DECOY: PHASE 1 – THE COMMUTE,’ the message read, followed by a string of duck and explosion emojis. The route was ludicrous. It took her on a winding, circuitous tour of Coquitlam’s most nondescript suburban streets, adding a full fifteen minutes to her drive time, all to avoid the direct, efficient route that ran past a small park with a creek. A creek. It might as well have been the Amazon River.

Behind the wheel of her impeccably maintained Audi, Eleanor felt like a fugitive. Every rustle in a hedge, every glint of light off a puddle in a driveway, sent a spike of adrenaline through her. She drove with her shoulders hunched, her knuckles white on the steering wheel, her eyes scanning not for traffic but for potential threats. A child’s bright yellow rain boots left on a lawn made her flinch. A weather vane shaped like a goose on a distant roof caused her to momentarily swerve. She was re-learning the landscape of her own city, redrawing the map based on a new and terrifying topography of fear. The world was no longer made of roads and buildings, but of safe zones and ambush points. She felt her professional self, the coolly competent Eleanor Vance, peeling away with every illogical turn, leaving behind someone smaller, more frantic, and utterly out of her depth.

The final approach to the office complex was the worst. Her usual parking spot, conveniently located near the main entrance, was now in a high-risk zone, offering a clear, unobstructed view of the pond. Maya’s instructions had been explicit: ‘Parkade Level P4, Sector Blue. Farthest from the elevator. Take the stairs. Enter through the west service entrance. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT look towards the water.’ Following the instructions felt both deeply humiliating and absolutely necessary. She parked in the designated gloomy corner of the parkade, the spot feeling both safe and subterranean, like a burrow. Taking the concrete fire stairs instead of the sleek glass elevator, she emerged into a service corridor that smelled of cleaning chemicals and damp cardboard, a secret, unlovely artery of the building she had never known existed. It was a coward’s entrance, and she was grateful for it.

Safely inside her twelfth-floor office, with the door shut, Eleanor leaned against it and took a shaky breath. The view from her window, once a source of calm, was now a threat. The pond was a malevolent blue eye staring up at her. She felt an urgent, powerful need to close the blinds, to wall herself in completely. But that would be noticed. It would be a deviation from the norm. It would invite questions, and questions were the last thing she could handle. Instead, she angled her chair so her back was mostly to the window and tried to lose herself in the familiar architecture of her email inbox. There were forty-seven unread messages. It was a comfort, a wall of digital bricks she could stack around herself.

Her focus, however, was shot. The Chong-Peterson file sat squarely in the middle of her desk, the draft of her letter about the garden gnome on top. Reading her own words—‘amicable resolution,’ ‘chattel,’ ‘provenance’—felt like reading a foreign language. How had she spent three hours on this? The fate of a ceramic gnome, which a day ago had felt like a descent into the absurd, now seemed like a quaint problem from a forgotten, simpler time. The gnome was not ancient. The gnome was not intelligent. The gnome did not know she was a fraud. She picked up her pen, intending to make a minor correction, but found herself sketching a crude, shaky drawing of a duck in the margins of her legal pad. Its eye was a furious black dot. She scribbled it out with such force that she tore the paper.

The knock on her door made her jump so violently she dropped the pen. It was Robert, a junior associate from down the hall, a young man with an eager-to-please posture and an unfortunate haircut. He was holding a cardboard tray with two coffees.
“Morning, Eleanor,” he said, his smile bright and guileless. “Figured you could use one. Heard you were out sick yesterday. Migraine, right? Brutal.”
“Thanks, Robert,” she managed, taking the cup. Her hand was still not entirely steady.
“No problem. Hey, did you see them this morning?” he asked, nodding towards the window. “They’re back.”
Eleanor’s blood ran cold. A low hum started in her ears. “See who?”
“The ducklings,” he said, blissfully unaware of the havoc he was wreaking. “The mother duck and her whole brood. They’re so cute. Just a little parade of fluffballs waddling after her. Right by the pond. You have the perfect view.” He beamed at her, proud to have delivered this charming piece of office news. “Anyway, have a good one.”

He left, closing the door behind him. Eleanor stood frozen, the coffee cup trembling in her hand. A brood. A parade of them. It wasn’t just one anymore. It was an army. The malevolent judge had brought its family. She didn’t dare look. She knew, with a certainty that defied all logic, that if she turned and looked out that window, she would see them. And they, in turn, would see her. The single, judgmental gaze had been enough to break her. A dozen of them would be unbearable. It would be a tribunal. She backed away from the window, her heel catching on the edge of the rug, and stumbled, catching herself on the edge of her desk. The hot coffee sloshed over her hand and onto the gnome letter, the dark liquid blooming across the words ‘amicable resolution,’ obscuring them completely.**Chapter 2**

The pain of the burn was a distant, secondary concern. Eleanor’s entire focus was on the spreading brown stain, a chaotic Rorschach test that had obliterated the legalese she had so carefully constructed. The dark liquid soaked into the paper, warping it, the scent of burnt coffee filling her pristine office. For a moment, she just stared at it, at the physical manifestation of her unravelling. Her monument to efficiency, now defaced. With a shaking hand, she grabbed a handful of tissues and began to dab uselessly at the mess, smearing the ink and shredding the wet paper. It was ruined. The gnome was victorious.

She sank into her leather chair, her back rigid, facing the door. She would not look at the window. She would not confirm the existence of the fluffy tribunal Robert had so cheerfully announced. To look was to be seen, and to be seen was to be judged. The logic was insane, but it was the only logic she had left. Her heart was still performing a frantic tattoo against her ribs. She pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over Maya’s contact. What could she even say? The absurdity of it was a physical weight. She typed a message, her fingers clumsy and stiff.

*They’ve multiplied.*

She hit send before she could second-guess herself. The reply came back in less than ten seconds, a small vibration against her damp palm.

*Code Nightingale. I repeat, Code Nightingale. Do not engage. Do not make eye contact. Am mobilizing. What’s your E.T.A. for exfiltration?*

Eleanor stared at the message. *Code Nightingale.* Maya had created a code for her duck-induced psychosis. The sheer, ridiculous gravity of it was so perfectly Maya that a hysterical bubble of laughter, or maybe a sob, rose in Eleanor’s throat. She choked it down. *Exfiltration.* She was no longer leaving work; she was being extracted from a hostile zone. She typed back: *18:00 hours.*

The rest of the morning passed in a fug of hyper-vigilance. Every time a shadow passed her window—a bird, a stray piece of paper caught in the wind—her stomach would clench. She tried to redraft the Chong-Peterson letter, but her mind refused to cooperate. She found herself staring at the name ‘Peterson’ and seeing ‘Peterson’s Pond.’ She typed ‘chattel’ and her fingers autocorrected it to ‘chattering,’ and she imagined a chorus of accusatory quacks. The work that had defined and insulated her for years was now a house of cards, and the Big Bad Wolf was a duck. She was losing her mind. She was a thirty-four-year-old corporate lawyer, brought low by waterfowl. The thought repeated itself, a dull, humiliating mantra.

At eleven, her phone buzzed with a scheduled conference call. It was with a senior partner and the client for a multi-million dollar corporate merger, a file that was supposed to be her crowning achievement of the quarter. She put on her headset, muted her microphone, and took three deep, measured breaths. She was Eleanor Vance, legal eagle. She could do this. She unmuted. “Eleanor Vance speaking.” Her voice was a stranger’s, thin and reedy.

“Eleanor, glad you could join us,” boomed the voice of Mr. Albright, the senior partner. “We’re just going over the revised shareholder agreement. Section 4b. Did you have a chance to review the proposed amendments from their side?”

She had. She’d spent all of Tuesday evening on it. But now, the details were a blur. Her mind was not on Section 4b. It was in the parkade, on the fire stairs, in the corridor that smelled of bleach. It was on the manicured grass by a man-made pond. “Yes,” she said, scrambling to pull up the correct document on her screen. Her eyes darted around the text, the words swimming. “The amendments… regarding executive compensation… they seem… broadly acceptable.”

“Broadly acceptable?” Albright’s voice sharpened. “Eleanor, they’re trying to sneak in a golden parachute clause for a CFO who’s been with the company for six months. It’s a bank heist disguised as a benefits package. Did you not read the footnotes?”

Shame, hot and sharp, pierced through the fog of her fear. This was her turf. Footnotes were her native language. And she’d missed it. “My apologies, Mr. Albright. I… I was looking at an earlier draft.” It was a clumsy, obvious lie. There was a beat of icy silence on the line. She could feel his disapproval through the phone, a pressure more acute than any client’s anger. It was the disappointment of a mentor. She had been his star pupil. Now, she was fumbling. She was dropping the ball. The duck knew. The duck had been right all along. She was a fraud.

The call concluded twenty minutes later, with Albright curtly informing her he would “handle the pushback” himself. The implication was clear: she was benched. When she hung up, the silence of her office was deafening. She had failed. Not just at pretending to be normal, but at the one thing she was supposed to be good at. The walls of legal jargon she had built for herself were crumbling from the inside out. All it took was a duck. She dropped her head into her hands, the elegant, professional facade of Eleanor Vance dissolving into pure, unadulterated panic.

Lunchtime came and went. The thought of navigating the office kitchen, of making small talk while her private world was imploding, was impossible. She stayed at her desk, chewing on a tasteless protein bar from her emergency desk drawer, when Robert knocked again, his face lit with the same oblivious cheer.

“Skipping lunch, Eleanor? Don’t work too hard,” he said, leaning against the doorframe. “You’ve gotta see this, though. It’ll make your day.” He was holding up his phone, his thumb poised over the screen. “I got a video. The little guys are trying to get in the water. One of them is scared. It’s hilarious. He just keeps…”

“No,” Eleanor said. The word was a croak.
Robert faltered, his smile wavering. “Sorry?”
“No. Thank you, Robert. I’m… I have a headache. The screen,” she improvised, gesturing vaguely at her own dark monitor. “The light.”
“Oh. Oh, sure. Sorry.” He backed away, looking confused and slightly hurt. “I’ll just… I’ll email you the link. You can watch it later.”

He was gone. Eleanor felt the adrenaline recede, leaving her shaky and nauseous. He was going to email it. A video. The threat was going to be in her inbox, nestled between a memo on billing practices and a revised shareholder agreement. It was a Trojan horse, a digital duck waiting to spring itself upon her. The office, her sanctuary, was no longer safe. The enemy had breached the firewall.

By five o’clock, she was a wreck. She had accomplished nothing of value all day. Her office felt like a cage suspended twelve stories in the air, a glass box waiting to be shattered. At five forty-five, a new text from Maya arrived.

*Extraction specialist on site. Proceed to rendezvous point P4-Blue. I have eyes on the pond. It’s a goddamn Disney movie down here. Over.*

Eleanor packed her briefcase with trembling hands, the simple act of clicking the latches feeling like a monumental effort. She shut down her computer without looking at her inbox, leaving the emailed video from Robert to fester in the dark. She put on her jacket, took one last, fearful glance around the office that had once been her kingdom, and walked out. She took the service corridor and the fire stairs again, her heels echoing in the concrete well. Each flight of stairs felt like a descent into madness.

When she pushed open the heavy door to the P4 level of the parkade, she saw her. Maya was leaning against the hood of her battered pickup truck, which she had somehow managed to park directly next to Eleanor’s pristine Audi, taking up two spots. She was wearing a pair of military-style cargo pants and a black t-shirt that said ‘ART IS A VERB’. On her head, perched at a jaunty angle, was a bicycle helmet, and in her hand, she held a large, open golf umbrella, which she was using like a periscope to peer over the concrete barrier towards the distant pond.

“Target acquired,” Maya said in a low, conspiratorial whisper as Eleanor approached. “We have movement. Seven hostiles, plus the alpha female. They’re congregating near the west bank. Our exit is clear, but we have to move fast.”

Eleanor stared at her friend—the ridiculous helmet, the umbrella, the dead-serious expression on her face—and the tension in her chest loosened just enough for her to breathe. “You’re insane,” she whispered.
“You’re the one who’s afraid of ducks, I’m just the mission support,” Maya retorted, snapping the umbrella shut. “Now get in the car, Ellie-Bellie. I’m your designated driver. We’re going to my place. My studio has no windows and I can personally guarantee it is one hundred percent waterfowl-free. Let’s go. Debriefing will happen over tacos.”

Eleanor didn’t argue. She threw her briefcase into the back of Maya’s truck, slid into the passenger seat, which was covered in metal shavings and smelled of spray paint, and let her friend peel out of the parkade with a screech of tires that was entirely unnecessary. As they drove, Eleanor didn’t look back. She kept her eyes fixed on the chaotic, reassuring mess of Maya’s dashboard, a landscape of old coffee cups, stray drill bits, and a half-eaten bag of licorice. For the first time in two days, she wasn't the one driving. She had surrendered the wheel. And as they sped away from the orderly business park and its terrible, feathered inhabitants, she felt a profound and terrifying sense of release.**Chapter 3**

Maya’s studio was located in a sprawling, low-slung industrial park on the Port Moody border, a world away from the polished glass towers of Coquitlam Centre. The building was a corrugated metal box that had, in previous lives, been a marine engine repair shop and a short-lived artisanal kombucha brewery. The air outside smelled of salt, rust, and low tide. As Maya rolled up the huge garage door with a noisy metallic shriek, she revealed a space that was the physical antithesis of Eleanor’s entire existence. It was vast, cavernous, and gloriously chaotic. Half-finished sculptures of welded steel and copper piping stood like skeletal sentinels in the gloom, their shadows thrown long and distorted by a single bare bulb. The floor was a Jackson Pollock of paint splatters, oil stains, and metal dust, and every available surface was piled high with what Eleanor’s mind catalogued as junk: discarded engine blocks, twisted rebar, a pyramid of old computer monitors, and a literal bucket of bolts.

For a moment, Eleanor just stood on the threshold, her sensible heels looking absurd on the greasy concrete. The place smelled powerfully of ozone, hot metal, and turpentine, a sharp, industrial perfume that was the polar opposite of the faint, anonymous scent of lemon polish and air freshener that defined her own spaces. Yet, as she stepped inside and the garage door rumbled shut behind her, sealing them in, she didn't feel anxious. The chaos wasn't threatening. It was honest. Nothing in this room was pretending to be something it wasn't. A pile of scrap metal was just a pile of scrap metal, not a monument to a hollow life. It was a workshop, a place where things were made and unmade, and for the first time in days, Eleanor felt like she could breathe without a small, feathered judge watching her every inhalation.

“Tacos are on the way,” Maya announced, tossing her bike helmet onto a workbench with a clatter. “Beer’s in the mini-fridge that I swear is not a fire hazard. Make yourself at home, just don’t sit on anything that looks sharp, actively on fire, or artistically significant.” She gestured vaguely at a pair of mismatched stools next to a table made from an old electrical spool. Eleanor navigated the obstacle course of her friend’s creativity and perched gingerly on one of the stools, her charcoal grey suit feeling laughably out of place. She felt like a tax auditor who had wandered into a pirate’s den.

When the tacos arrived, delivered by a surly teen on an e-bike, they ate them straight out of the cardboard box, the greasy, spicy scent mingling with the studio’s metallic tang. Maya ate with gusto, salsa dripping down her chin as she laid out her analysis. “Okay. So the enemy has established a beachhead and is multiplying. This complicates things. A single operative is one thing, but a cell, with juveniles? That suggests a long-term campaign. They’re trying to psychologically demoralize you. The video was a classic propaganda drop. We can’t let them win the information war.”

Eleanor picked at her carnitas, the food tasteless in her mouth. The wine from the night before had worn off, and the terror had seeped back in, duller now, but heavier. “I made a fool of myself at work, Maya,” she said, her voice quiet. “I missed something huge. On the Albright file. He was so disappointed. He practically took me off the case.” She stared at her hands, which were clean and manicured and looked like they belonged to someone else. “It’s like the duck scrambled my brain, and now I can’t even do the one thing I’m good at. It’s like it… it knew. It looked at me and it knew I was a fraud, that my whole life is just… billable hours and meal prep and an empty condo. It’s all so brittle. And the duck just… pecked it. And it’s all falling apart.”

The confession hung in the air between them, fragile and ugly. It wasn’t just about a duck. It was never just about the duck. The duck was simply the thing that had held up a mirror, and she had hated what she saw. Maya stopped chewing. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, her expression losing its playful, conspiratorial edge and becoming entirely serious. She looked at Eleanor, then around her cavernous studio, at the beautiful, strange things she had wrenched from the discarded and the broken.

“So the duck called bullshit on your life,” Maya said, her voice soft but firm. “Okay. Maybe you needed someone to. Or something.” She stood and walked over to a hulking shape covered by a dusty tarp. With a theatrical flourish, she whipped it off, revealing a twisted, vaguely humanoid figure made from the innards of a commercial dryer, a dozen bent bicycle wheels, and the chrome grille of an old Ford. It was simultaneously hideous and breathtaking. “See this guy? This used to be a bunch of perfectly functional, separate things. The dryer dried clothes. The wheels spun. The grille just sat on a car. They did their jobs. Predictably. Orderly.” She ran a hand over a jagged edge of bent metal. “They were boring as hell. Sometimes you have to smash the functional thing, El. You have to take it all apart to find the interesting shapes. To build something that’s actually about something. Maybe your life wasn’t a monument. Maybe it was just a cage. And this duck, this weird, malevolent, emerald-headed little bastard, just showed you the lock.”

Eleanor stared at the sculpture. She didn’t understand it, not in the way Maya did, but she understood the principle. Destruction as a prerequisite for creation. Her own life felt like it was in the destruction phase, but she had no idea what, if anything, could be built from the wreckage. “So what do I do?” she asked, her voice a near-whisper. “I can’t live like this. I can’t build a life around avoiding puddles and taking the back stairs.”

“No, you can’t,” Maya agreed, her eyes gleaming with a familiar, dangerous fire. “Operation Decoy was a containment strategy. It’s not a solution. It’s a bunker, and I don’t want you living in a bunker. We need to move to Phase Two.” She strode back to the table, grabbing a piece of charcoal from a jar and a clean patch of floor. “Phase Two: Reconnaissance and Engagement.”

Eleanor’s stomach plummeted. “Engagement? Maya, no. I can’t…”

“Not yet. Recon first.” Maya began sketching on the concrete, her movements broad and certain. “Hiding isn’t working. The fear is following you. It’s getting in through your email. It’s coming at you through your colleagues. The only way out is through. We need to demystify the threat. We need to take the power back.” She looked up from her crude drawing of a park layout, her face alight with the thrill of a terrible, brilliant idea. “Tomorrow, after work, we’re going on a safari.”

“A safari,” Eleanor repeated, her voice flat with dread.

“A duck safari,” Maya confirmed, her smile wide and slightly manic. “Not your pond. Neutral ground. We’ll go to Rocky Point Park. We’ll take my truck, find a safe vantage point. We’ll bring binoculars. A thermos of something strong. We’re going to watch them. We’re going to study their movements, their habits, their social structures. We’re going to reduce them from a monolithic, existential threat into what they actually are: dumb, greedy, feathered little opportunists who poop everywhere. We are going to stare into the abyss, Ellie-Bellie, and the abyss is going to quack back. And you’re going to see that it’s just a noise.”

The thought was paralyzing. To willingly go towards the source of her terror felt like a violation of every self-preservational instinct she possessed. Her body screamed ‘NO.’ Run. Hide. Close the blinds. But as she looked at Maya, standing there in her paint-splattered clothes, so fierce and loyal and utterly convinced, a different feeling began to stir beneath the fear. It was exhaustion. She was so tired of being afraid. She was tired of her world shrinking, of her own mind betraying her. She looked at her hands, still trembling slightly, and then back at her friend. She couldn’t speak, so she just nodded, a single, jerky movement. It wasn’t agreement, not yet. It was surrender.**Chapter 3**

Maya’s studio was located in a sprawling, low-slung industrial park on the Port Moody border, a world away from the polished glass towers of Coquitlam Centre. The building was a corrugated metal box that had, in previous lives, been a marine engine repair shop and a short-lived artisanal kombucha brewery. The air outside smelled of salt, rust, and low tide. As Maya rolled up the huge garage door with a noisy metallic shriek, she revealed a space that was the physical antithesis of Eleanor’s entire existence. It was vast, cavernous, and gloriously chaotic. Half-finished sculptures of welded steel and copper piping stood like skeletal sentinels in the gloom, their shadows thrown long and distorted by a single bare bulb. The floor was a Jackson Pollock of paint splatters, oil stains, and metal dust, and every available surface was piled high with what Eleanor’s mind catalogued as junk: discarded engine blocks, twisted rebar, a pyramid of old computer monitors, and a literal bucket of bolts.

For a moment, Eleanor just stood on the threshold, her sensible heels looking absurd on the greasy concrete. The place smelled powerfully of ozone, hot metal, and turpentine, a sharp, industrial perfume that was the polar opposite of the faint, anonymous scent of lemon polish and air freshener that defined her own spaces. Yet, as she stepped inside and the garage door rumbled shut behind her, sealing them in, she didn't feel anxious. The chaos wasn't threatening. It was honest. Nothing in this room was pretending to be something it wasn't. A pile of scrap metal was just a pile of scrap metal, not a monument to a hollow life. It was a workshop, a place where things were made and unmade, and for the first time in days, Eleanor felt like she could breathe without a small, feathered judge watching her every inhalation.

“Tacos are on the way,” Maya announced, tossing her bike helmet onto a workbench with a clatter. “Beer’s in the mini-fridge that I swear is not a fire hazard. Make yourself at home, just don’t sit on anything that looks sharp, actively on fire, or artistically significant.” She gestured vaguely at a pair of mismatched stools next to a table made from an old electrical spool. Eleanor navigated the obstacle course of her friend’s creativity and perched gingerly on one of the stools, her charcoal grey suit feeling laughably out of place. She felt like a tax auditor who had wandered into a pirate’s den.

When the tacos arrived, delivered by a surly teen on an e-bike, they ate them straight out of the cardboard box, the greasy, spicy scent mingling with the studio’s metallic tang. Maya ate with gusto, salsa dripping down her chin as she laid out her analysis. “Okay. So the enemy has established a beachhead and is multiplying. This complicates things. A single operative is one thing, but a cell, with juveniles? That suggests a long-term campaign. They’re trying to psychologically demoralize you. The video was a classic propaganda drop. We can’t let them win the information war.”

Eleanor picked at her carnitas, the food tasteless in her mouth. The wine from the night before had worn off, and the terror had seeped back in, duller now, but heavier. “I made a fool of myself at work, Maya,” she said, her voice quiet. “I missed something huge. On the Albright file. He was so disappointed. He practically took me off the case.” She stared at her hands, which were clean and manicured and looked like they belonged to someone else. “It’s like the duck scrambled my brain, and now I can’t even do the one thing I’m good at.

It was surrender.**Chapter 4**

The next day at the office was an exercise in sustained, low-level dread. The impending duck safari loomed over every email, every phone call, a terrifying appointment she had made with her own psychosis. She functioned, but only just. Her body was present in her twelfth-floor office, but her mind was already at Rocky Point Park, cringing in anticipation. She avoided the window with a diligence that was becoming second nature, developing a new, crab-like way of moving around her desk to keep the glass pane out of her peripheral vision. When she received an email from Robert with the subject line ‘Cute Duckling Video! :)’, she deleted it without opening it, the act feeling both cowardly and like a significant victory. It was the first proactive step she had taken against the invasion, a small digital parry.

The workday ended with a merciful lack of incident. Mr. Albright did not call. No new files involving emotionally significant lawn ornaments landed on her desk. At six o’clock, she packed her briefcase, her hands clammy. This time, as she descended the concrete fire stairs to the parkade, the echo of her heels didn't sound like panic. It sounded like a death march. Maya was waiting, her truck idling impatiently. She had changed into what she had apparently deemed safari-appropriate attire: a khaki vest with far too many pockets, and a pair of formidable-looking hiking boots. A pair of high-powered binoculars on a strap hung around her neck.

“Get in, soldier,” Maya said, her tone brisk. “No time to waste. Dusk is prime waterfowl activity time. We need to get into position before they settle in for the night.”

The drive to Port Moody was thick with Eleanor’s silent apprehension. Maya, sensing her friend’s state, kept up a running commentary that was part mission briefing, part pep talk. She pointed out ‘potential ambush sites’ (a water-filled ditch) and ‘safe houses’ (a car wash), narrating their journey as if they were moving through enemy territory. In a thermos cupped between her legs, Eleanor could feel the warmth of what Maya had called ‘liquid courage,’ which she suspected was mostly cheap brandy with a splash of tea. She didn’t touch it. She needed her fear to be sharp and undiluted. If she was going to face this, she couldn’t do it numb.

Rocky Point Park was teeming with oblivious civilians. Families pushed strollers along the waterfront path, cyclists glided by, and the scent of fried onions and mini donuts from the concession stands hung heavy in the air. It was a scene of such determined, suburban pleasantness that it made Eleanor’s terror feel obscene. These people were worried about sticky fingers and scraped knees. She was worried about the structural integrity of her sanity in the face of a creature most people found charming. Maya parked the truck in a spot overlooking the grassy area that sloped down to the Burrard Inlet, offering a clear, if distant, view of the shore. The location was a compromise: close enough to see, far enough to feel safe.

“Okay. This is our forward operating base,” Maya declared, killing the engine. “From here, we observe. We don’t engage. We don’t even get out of the vehicle until you give the all-clear.” She unslung the binoculars and handed them to Eleanor. They felt heavy, like a weapon. “Take a look. Tell me what you see.”

Eleanor’s hands trembled as she raised the binoculars to her eyes. She didn’t want to. It felt like willingly looking at the monster under the bed. But she took a breath, the air tasting of salt and impending doom, and focused the lens. The world snapped into sharp, magnified detail. And there they were. Dozens of them. They weren't standing preternaturally still like her office tormentor. They were in constant, idiotic motion. She saw a group of them in the water, their tails pointing straight up to the sky as they foraged for whatever lay beneath. Another was waddling at high speed after a toddler who had dropped a cracker, its movements clumsy and comical. She saw two drakes engaged in a furious, flapping squabble over a piece of soggy lettuce, their emerald heads bobbing aggressively.

“Report, Vance. What’s the enemy doing?” Maya’s voice was low, right beside her ear.
“They’re… fighting. Over some garbage,” Eleanor said, her own voice sounding surprised.
“Are they convening a tribunal to assess your moral failings?”
“No. They’re… one of them is trying to eat a bottle cap.”
“A bottle cap. Right. Master strategist, that one. What else?”

Eleanor swiveled the binoculars. She watched a mother duck trying to herd her unruly line of fluffball offspring, who kept scattering in different directions. She wasn't leading a disciplined platoon; she was a stressed-out single mom at a supermarket. Then she found him. A lone drake, standing on a rock near the water’s edge. His head had the same impossible, oily green sheen. His eye was a black bead. He was looking in their general direction. Eleanor’s breath hitched. The familiar cold dread washed over her. This was him. The judge.

“Maya,” she whispered, her knuckles white on the binoculars. “There’s one. It’s looking this way.”
“Okay. Hold steady. Don’t break contact,” Maya coached. “What’s he doing? Is he unravelling you with his gaze? Is he peeling the skin from your bones with the power of his mind?”
“He’s just standing there. Staring.”
“Keep watching.”

Eleanor did. She kept the drake locked in the magnified circle of her vision, her heart hammering. The world outside the circle ceased to exist. It was just her and the duck, a silent, cross-park standoff. The duck stood there for a long, tense moment. And then, it lifted one leg, tucked its head under its wing, and began to vigorously scratch its own back with its beak. It wobbled precariously on one foot, lost its balance for a second, then righted itself and shook its tail feathers in a flurry of motion. Then, it turned its back on them completely and let out a long stream of poop onto the rock.

A sound escaped Eleanor’s throat. It was a strangled gasp that turned into a laugh. A wild, unhinged, watery laugh that she couldn’t stop. The tears that had been threatening for days finally came, but they were tears of sheer, absurd relief. They streamed down her face as she laughed, lowering the binoculars. “It pooped,” she gasped, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. “It just… stood there and took a giant poop.”

Maya grinned, a wide, triumphant slash of a smile. She unscrewed the thermos and poured a generous amount of the ‘liquid courage’ into the cap, handing it to Eleanor. “And there you have it,” she said, her voice full of satisfaction. “The great, malevolent judge, brought low by a bowel movement. They’re not gods, El. They’re not ancient arbiters of your soul. They’re just floating loaves of bread with heads, like your mom said. And they poop everywhere.”

Eleanor took the cap and drank, the fiery brandy burning a clean, welcome trail down her throat. The terror was still there, a ghost of itself lingering in her bloodstream, but the awe was gone. The supernatural, judgmental power she had projected onto the creature had vanished in a single, mundane, biological act. They were just animals. Ridiculous, messy, hungry animals. She looked out the windshield, this time without the magnifying power of the binoculars. They were just small, feathered shapes in the distance, part of the scenery of a normal evening at a normal park. The world, which had become a hostile minefield, was slowly, cautiously, starting to look like the world again. The battle wasn't over, she knew that. But for the first time, it felt winnable.The laughter subsided into ragged, hiccuping breaths, leaving Eleanor feeling scoured out and strangely light. The brandy in her stomach was a warm, spreading anchor in the sea of her adrenaline. She leaned her head back against the seat, the cheap upholstery of Maya’s truck a bizarre comfort, and stared at the darkening sky through the windshield. The tension that had held her body hostage for three days was gone, not vanquished entirely, but released from its chokehold, leaving behind a dull, bruised ache. Maya didn’t speak. She just sat there, a solid, reassuring presence, letting the moment settle, giving Eleanor’s shattered composure the space it needed to reassemble itself into a new and unfamiliar shape.

“It was just so… ordinary,” Eleanor finally whispered, her voice hoarse from the laughing and the crying. She turned to look at Maya, whose face was illuminated by the soft glow of the dashboard lights. “All this time, I built it up into this… this mythical beast. This all-knowing arbiter. And it was just… an animal having a bodily function on a rock.” She shook her head, a fresh wave of absurdity washing over her, but this time it was funny, not terrifying. “I gave it all that power. I projected everything onto it. My job, my mother, the gnome… all of it. I thought it was judging me.”

“You didn’t give it to the duck, El,” Maya said softly, her usual boisterous energy reined in to a gentle thrum. “You were already carrying all that judgment around yourself. The duck was just a convenient, weirdly-shaped hook to hang it on. It was never about the duck. It was about you feeling like a fraud, and being so wound up that the first thing that really *looked* at you made you shatter.” She nudged Eleanor’s arm with her own. “The good news is, you’re not made of glass. You shattered, but you’re still here.”

Maya’s words landed with the simple, undeniable weight of truth. Eleanor had been the one prosecuting her own case, and she had found herself guilty. The duck was just a juror she had imagined. The realization was both profoundly humiliating and liberating. She had been her own monster all along. She looked past Maya, out the side window at the park, at the silhouettes of people strolling in the twilight. They looked real. The world looked real again, not like a stage set for her own private horror movie. The distant, intermittent quacking from the shoreline was just a sound, like the cry of a gull or the rumble of a passing train. It was a background murmur, not a verdict.

“So,” Maya said, breaking the silence, her voice regaining its usual mischievous edge. “Phase Three: Ground Assault. I smell mini donuts. You feel up for a strategic advance on the concession stand?” The suggestion was casual, but they both knew it was a dare. Get out of the truck. Walk on the grass. Willingly co-exist in the same open space as the enemy. The old, cold fear sent a faint, ghostly tremor through Eleanor’s nerves, an automatic response. But then the image of the duck, wobbling on one leg before turning its back on the world, surfaced in her mind. It was a surprisingly effective shield. She took a deep breath, the air no longer feeling thick and heavy. “Okay,” she said, her voice steadier than she expected. “Okay. Let’s get donuts.”

Getting out of the truck felt like stepping onto foreign soil. Eleanor’s heels sank slightly into the soft grass, the sensation both strange and grounding. The air was cool and smelled of salt and sugar. She kept Maya between her and the shoreline, a human shield she no longer felt she desperately needed but was grateful for nonetheless. They walked towards the bright lights of the food stand, the crunch of gravel under their feet a steady, rhythmic beat. Eleanor found herself looking around, really looking, for the first time in days. She saw the intricate patterns of the evening clouds, the happy chaos of a dog chasing a frisbee, the warm glow emanating from the windows of the brewery across the street. These were the details her fear had erased, the texture of a life she had been too terrified to live. The world was re-emerging in all its mundane, beautiful complexity, and the ducks were just one small, messy part of it.At the donut stand, a beacon of cheerful, greasy light, the transaction was blessedly normal. A bored teenager took their order, her only judgment reserved for Maya’s questionable vest. They were handed a paper bag, warm and heavy, radiating a glorious scent of hot oil and cinnamon sugar. They found an empty bench away from the main path, the wood still warm from the day’s sun. Eleanor pulled out a donut. It was misshapen, overly dusted with sugar, and utterly perfect. She took a bite, and the taste was an explosion of simple, uncomplicated pleasure. It was warm and soft and sweet, a direct and honest thing, and she realized with a jolt that she couldn’t remember the last time she had eaten something that wasn’t chosen for its nutritional value or caloric efficiency.

“So,” Maya said, her own mouth full. “We faced the horde and were rewarded with fried dough. I call that a successful military campaign.” She leaned back, propping her formidable boots on the bench. “How’s the heart rate? Are we still in the red zone?”

Eleanor considered it. She took another bite of the donut, chewing slowly, taking inventory of her own body. The frantic, trapped bird in her chest had stilled. Her muscles, which had been coiled springs for days, felt loose and heavy. “It’s… quiet,” she said, the word sounding foreign and new. She looked over towards the dark water, where the ducks had become indistinct shapes in the gathering dusk. A faint quack carried on the breeze, and she felt a flicker, a tiny echo of the fear, like the phantom pain of a severed limb. But it was only an echo. It had no power. “I think the red zone has been downgraded to a cautious yellow.”

They ate their donuts in a companionable silence, watching the last of the light fade over the inlet. The walk back to the truck was different. The path was clearer in Eleanor’s mind, the shadows less menacing. The world had stopped holding its breath. She felt a profound and bone-deep exhaustion, but it was the cathartic weariness that follows a fever breaking, not the draining, corrosive fatigue of perpetual anxiety. As she climbed back into the passenger seat of Maya’s truck, the smell of old paint and metal shavings was no longer the scent of a chaotic rescue, but the familiar, comforting smell of her friend’s world, a world that had made room for her own to fall apart and then begin to knit itself back together.

On the drive back to Eleanor’s condo, the triumphant energy of the safari gave way to a quieter, more thoughtful mood. The adrenaline was gone, and in its place was the looming question of what came next. The duck had been dealt with, but the life the duck had exposed was still waiting for her.

“I have to go to work tomorrow,” Eleanor said, staring at the rhythmic sweep of the streetlights passing overhead. “I have to go back to my office, with the window, and the pond. And the gnome.”

“Yeah, you do,” Maya said, her voice gentle. “But you’re not the same person who ran out of there yesterday. You’ve seen the enemy take a crap on a rock. That’s hard to un-see. It changes the power dynamic.” She glanced over at Eleanor, her expression serious. “The question isn’t whether you can go back to work, El. The question is, how do you want to work? How do you want to live? The duck didn’t break your world. It just showed you the cracks that were already there. You can’t just caulk them up with legal jargon and pretend they don’t exist anymore.”

When Maya dropped her off, the lobby of Eleanor’s condo building felt different. The hushed quiet, the muted colours, the scent of something vaguely floral—it no longer felt like a sanctuary of order. It felt like a waiting room. Upstairs, she unlocked her door and stepped into the apartment. The silence was absolute. But for the first time in days, it wasn’t the silence of a tomb or a cage. It was just… empty. It was a blank page. She dropped her keys and briefcase on the hall table, the clatter echoing in the stillness. Instead of turning on the lights and closing the blinds, she walked straight through the living room to the floor-to-ceiling window that made up the far wall. The window she had paid a premium for, the view she had used as a metric of her success. She had avoided it for days, afraid of what she might see. Now, she stood before it and looked out. The city was a glittering tapestry of light against the deep velvet of the night sky. The perpetual motion of the distant highway was a river of gold and red. It was an orderly view. Predictable. But it no longer felt like a reflection of her own rigid self-control. It just felt like a view. Her gaze drifted downwards, in the general direction of her office complex, a dark shape in the distance. She thought of the small, man-made pond, invisible from here, a tiny patch of dark water under the moon. And she felt nothing. Not fear. Not relief. Just a quiet, clinical curiosity. She wondered if the ducklings were sleeping.**Chapter 5**

The next morning, Eleanor woke before her alarm. The first sensation was not the familiar, frantic thumping in her chest, but a deep, profound stillness. For a moment, she lay motionless, taking inventory. The air in her bedroom was cool and still. The blackout blinds, which had been a desperate defense against the dawn, now seemed merely functional. She felt an ache in her bones, the pleasant soreness that follows strenuous effort, and she knew it was the residue of the fear finally leaving her system. She rose and, without a moment’s hesitation, pulled the cord on the blinds. Morning light, pale and grey, flooded the room, and she did not flinch. The world outside was just the world, no longer a jury waiting to be seated.

In her car, she paused. The screenshot of Maya’s meticulously planned, duck-free route was still open on her phone. She looked at its winding, nonsensical yellow lines, a map of her own recent madness. Then, with a quiet finality, she closed the image and pulled out of the parkade, turning not towards the convoluted suburban detour, but onto the main road. She was taking the direct route. Every landmark that had been a source of terror just a day before was now rendered inert, stripped of its malevolent power. The park with the creek was just a park with a creek. A flock of pigeons scattering from a rooftop was just a flock of pigeons. She was driving through her own city, not a hostile territory, and the difference was so vast and so simple it was breathtaking. She felt a strange sense of ownership, as if she were reclaiming it, mile by mile.

She parked in her usual spot, the one with the clear view of the business park’s cosmetic centerpiece. As she got out of her car, the crisp morning air felt clean, not heavy with threat. She began the walk towards the main entrance, her heels clicking a steady, even rhythm on the pavement. And then she saw them. They were on the manicured grass, a dozen of them, pecking aimlessly. The mother, the fluffy brood, and several drakes, their emerald heads glinting in the morning sun. Her nemesis from the other day was among them. Eleanor’s steps faltered for only a single heartbeat, a muscle memory of fear. But she didn’t stop. She kept walking. The drake looked up, its black bead of an eye fixing on her for a moment. Eleanor looked back. There was no ancient intelligence, no cold condemnation. There was only the vacant, instinct-driven stare of an animal wondering if she might have bread. It let out a short, unimpressive quack, then turned away to bully a smaller duck out of a promising patch of grass. Eleanor walked past, and the only emotion she felt was a faint, detached amusement.

Once inside her office, the sense of transformation was absolute. The room was no longer a glass cage but simply her office, a place where she worked. She walked directly to the window and looked down. The scene below was almost bucolic. The little parade of ducklings waddled after their mother, a chaotic, fluffy line. Robert had been right. They were, in an objective, unthreatening way, cute. The pond was just a pond. She felt a phantom limb of her former terror, a memory of how it had felt to be so afraid of this view, and the distance between that person and the person standing here now felt immense. She had crossed some invisible, internal border, and she knew, with a quiet certainty, that she could not go back.

It wasn't long before Robert appeared at her door, his expression tentative. He was holding his phone, but this time he kept it lowered. “Morning, Eleanor. Glad to see you’re in. You feeling better?” he asked, his voice laced with the caution of someone who had been unexpectedly snapped at.

“Much better, thank you, Robert,” she said, and was surprised to find she meant it. She smiled at him, a small, genuine smile that seemed to startle him. “The migraine broke.”

“Oh, good. That’s great,” he said, relaxing slightly. “Hey, I, uh, deleted that email I sent you. The video. Figured with your headache, you probably didn’t…”

“It’s fine, Robert,” she interrupted gently. “I saw the live performance this morning on my way in. They’re very active.” The corner of her mouth twitched. “Quite the little drama down there.” The bewildered but relieved look on his face was, she had to admit, deeply satisfying. He mumbled something about coffee and made a hasty retreat, leaving Eleanor alone with her work.

Her eyes fell on the Albright file, the source of her professional humiliation. The shame was still there, a sour taste in her mouth, but it was no longer tangled up with existential dread. It was just a mistake. A big one, but a manageable one. She spent the next hour re-reading every line, every footnote, her mind sharp and clear for the first time in days. The legal jargon she had once used as a shield now felt like a tool again, a set of instruments she knew how to wield with precision. She saw the flaw in her own previous logic, the laziness of her analysis. She saw the trap the opposition had set, and she saw three different ways to dismantle it. Then, she picked up her phone and dialed Mr. Albright’s direct line.

“Albright,” he answered, his voice clipped and impatient.

“Mr. Albright, it’s Eleanor Vance,” she said, her own voice steady and calm. “I’m calling about the merger file. You were right yesterday. I was unprepared, and my analysis was superficial. There are no excuses.” She paused, letting the admission hang in the air. “I’ve reviewed it again. The golden parachute clause is a non-starter, but I believe we can leverage their attempt into a stronger position on the intellectual property transfer. I have a strategy. I’d like the opportunity to fix my mistake and lead the response.”

There was a long silence on the other end of the line, so long that Eleanor wondered if he had hung up. Then, he cleared his throat. “Well, Vance,” he said, and the ice in his tone had thawed, replaced by a note of grudging respect. “It takes guts to admit a screw-up of that magnitude. It takes more to have a plan to fix it an hour later. Alright. The ball’s in your court. Don’t drop it again.” He hung up. Eleanor placed the receiver back in its cradle, a slow smile spreading across her face. She wasn’t a fraud. She was a lawyer who had made a mistake, and who was now going to fix it.

At the end of the day, she turned her attention to the last piece of unfinished business. The Chong-Peterson file. The coffee-stained letter about the garden gnome sat on her desk like a relic from another life. She looked at it, at the florid, empty words like ‘amicable resolution’ and ‘chattel.’ Three billable hours to say nothing, to solve nothing. It was absurd. She picked it up, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it decisively into the recycling bin. Then, she opened her web browser and typed ‘Garden Gnomes for Sale, Coquitlam’.

An hour later, she was standing in the garden section of a Canadian Tire, the air thick with the smell of potting soil and rubber tires. She was still in her severe charcoal suit, her briefcase in one hand, staring at a row of garishly painted ceramic figures. There were gnomes fishing, gnomes holding lanterns, gnomes sleeping on mushrooms. They were all aesthetically displeasing. She found one that looked particularly cheerful, with a foolish, rosy-cheeked grin and a bright blue coat. It was ridiculous. It was perfect. She picked it up. It was surprisingly heavy, a solid, tangible thing. She carried it to the checkout, her decision feeling both profoundly illogical and absolutely correct.

Driving home, the gnome was buckled into her passenger seat, its painted smile catching the light from the setting sun. Eleanor glanced at it, then back at the road. Her phone buzzed, a reminder for her 7:00 PM spin class, an appointment she had kept religiously for two years. Without taking her eyes off the road, she reached over and dismissed the notification. Tonight, she had other plans. She wasn’t sure what they were yet, but she knew they would not be partitioned into six-minute increments. The sterile quiet of her condo was waiting, but it no longer felt like a destination. It felt like a starting point. The world had not broken her. It had broken her open.The next morning, Eleanor woke before her alarm. The first sensation was not the familiar, frantic thumping in her chest, but a deep, profound stillness. For a moment, she lay motionless, taking inventory. The air in her bedroom was cool and still. The blackout blinds, which had been a desperate defense against the dawn, now seemed merely functional. She felt an ache in her bones, the pleasant soreness that follows strenuous effort, and she knew it was the residue of the fear finally leaving her system. She rose and, without a moment’s hesitation, pulled the cord on the blinds. Morning light, pale and grey, flooded the room, and she did not flinch. The world outside was just the world, no longer a jury waiting to be seated.

In her car, she paused. The screenshot of Maya’s meticulously planned, duck-free route was still open on her phone. She looked at its winding, nonsensical yellow lines, a map of her own recent madness. Then, with a quiet finality, she closed the image and pulled out of the parkade, turning not towards the convoluted suburban detour, but onto the main road. She was taking the direct route. Every landmark that had been a source of terror just a day before was now rendered inert, stripped of its malevolent power. The park with the creek was just a park with a creek. A flock of pigeons scattering from a rooftop was just a flock of pigeons. She was driving through her own city, not a hostile territory, and the difference was so vast and so simple it was breathtaking. She felt a strange sense of ownership, as if she were reclaiming it, mile by mile.

She parked in her usual spot, the one with the clear view of the business park’s cosmetic centerpiece. As she got out of her car, the crisp morning air felt clean, not heavy with threat. She began the walk towards the main entrance, her heels clicking a steady, even rhythm on the pavement. And then she saw them. They were on the manicured grass, a dozen of them, pecking aimlessly. The mother, the fluffy brood, and several drakes, their emerald heads glinting in the morning sun. Her nemesis from the other day was among them. Eleanor’s steps faltered for only a single heartbeat, a muscle memory of fear. But she didn’t stop. She kept walking. The drake looked up, its black bead of an eye fixing on her for a moment. Eleanor looked back. There was no ancient intelligence, no cold condemnation. There was only the vacant, instinct-driven stare of an animal wondering if she might have bread. It let out a short, unimpressive quack, then turned away to bully a smaller duck out of a promising patch of grass. Eleanor walked past, and the only emotion she felt was a faint, detached amusement.

Once inside her office, the sense of transformation was absolute. The room was no longer a glass cage but simply her office, a place where she worked. She walked directly to the window and looked down. The scene below was almost bucolic. The little parade of ducklings waddled after their mother, a chaotic, fluffy line. Robert had been right. They were, in an objective, unthreatening way, cute. The pond was just a pond. She felt a phantom limb of her former terror, a memory of how it had felt to be so afraid of this view, and the distance between that person and the person standing here now felt immense. She had crossed some invisible, internal border, and she knew, with a quiet certainty, that she could not go back.

It wasn't long before Robert appeared at her door, his expression tentative. He was holding his phone, but this time he kept it lowered. “Morning, Eleanor. Glad to see you’re in. You feeling better?” he asked, his voice laced with the caution of someone who had been unexpectedly snapped at. “Much better, thank you, Robert,” she said, and was surprised to find she meant it. She smiled at him, a small, genuine smile that seemed to startle him. “The migraine broke.” “Oh, good. That’s great,” he said, relaxing slightly. “Hey, I, uh, deleted that email I sent you. The video. Figured with your headache, you probably didn’t…” “It’s fine, Robert,” she interrupted gently. “I saw the live performance this morning on my way in. They’re very active.” The corner of her mouth twitched. “Quite the little drama down there.” The bewildered but relieved look on his face was, she had to admit, deeply satisfying.

The sterile quiet of her condo was waiting, but it no longer felt like a destination. It felt like a starting point. The world had not broken her. It had broken her open.**Chapter 6**

The next morning, the gnome sat on her passenger seat again, its cheerful, idiotic face a stark contrast to the sleek, black leather interior of her Audi. Her plan, formed in the quiet hours of the night after she had cancelled her spin class and instead sat on her balcony listening to the sounds of the city, was simple, direct, and professionally inadvisable. She was not going to draft a motion. She was not going to send a carefully worded email to opposing counsel. She was going to deliver the gnome. In person. She had looked up Mr. Peterson’s address in the file, an act that felt like a minor transgression, a breach of the sterile protocol that usually governed her interactions with the other side. She had billed zero minutes for the purchase of the gnome and would bill zero minutes for this trip. It was an act of pure, unbillable insanity.

Mr. Peterson lived in a modest, older bungalow on a quiet street in a part of Coquitlam that was rapidly being torn down and rebuilt into rows of towering townhouses. His home was an island of the past, with a meticulously kept lawn, rose bushes that were pruned with military precision, and a conspicuous, gnome-sized empty patch of dirt by the front walkway. Eleanor parked her car, took a deep breath, and lifted the ceramic figure from the seat. Carrying it up the short concrete path, she felt a fresh wave of absurdity. She was a corporate lawyer in a silk blouse and pencil skirt, hand-delivering a garden gnome as a peace offering in a divorce dispute. If Mr. Albright could see her now, he would revoke her parking pass on principle.

She rang the bell. After a long moment, the door opened a crack, held by a security chain. An eye, rheumy and suspicious, peered out at her. “What do you want?” a man’s voice rasped.

“Mr. Peterson?” Eleanor asked, her own voice sounding unnaturally high. “My name is Eleanor Vance. I’m Mrs. Chong’s lawyer.”

The eye narrowed. “I’ve got nothing to say to you. Talk to my lawyer. That’s the proper channel.” The door started to close.

“Wait,” Eleanor said quickly, her heart suddenly pounding. This was a terrible idea. “I’m not here in an official capacity. I just… I brought you this.” She held up the gnome. Its painted smile seemed to mock her.

The door stopped closing. The eye blinked, then looked from Eleanor’s face to the gnome and back again. There was a long, heavy silence, filled only by the distant sound of a leaf blower. Then, the chain rattled and the door swung open. Mr. Peterson was a small, stooped man in a faded cardigan and slippers, his face a roadmap of grief and anger. He looked nothing like the litigious monster she had pictured from his lawyer’s correspondence. He just looked old and tired. He stared at the new gnome, his expression unreadable.

“It’s not the right one,” he said, his voice rough.

“I know,” Eleanor said softly. “I know it isn’t. I just… I read the file. I know the other one came from your wife. I am so sorry for your loss. And I am sorry for the way this… this whole thing has been handled. It’s a poor substitute, I know. But I hoped it might… help.”

He didn’t answer. He just reached out a trembling, age-spotted hand and touched the gnome’s red hat, his fingers tracing the smooth, painted ceramic. When he looked up at Eleanor, his eyes were shining with unshed tears. “She bought him on our trip to the Okanagan. For our twenty-fifth anniversary. Said he looked like my father.” A single tear escaped and tracked a path through the wrinkles on his cheek. “When he was gone… it was like she was gone all over again. They said it was just a thing. A ‘chattel.’ But it wasn’t.”

The word hit Eleanor like a punch to the gut. *Chattel*. Her word. A dry, plaster word she had used to caulk a crack of raw human emotion. A word that had taken a man’s grief and rendered it small and insignificant, a petty squabble over a piece of property. In that moment, standing on a stranger’s doorstep, she felt the full, crushing weight of her own professional callousness. The judgment of the duck had been a vague, existential dread. This was specific. This was real.

“I was wrong,” she said, and the words felt inadequate, flimsy. “The language… the way we talk about these things… it’s wrong. It wasn't just chattel. It was a memory. And I am so, so sorry that I was a part of dismissing that.” She wasn’t speaking as a lawyer anymore. She wasn’t sure who she was speaking as.

Mr. Peterson just nodded, wiping his cheek with the back of his hand. He took the gnome from her, his hands wrapping around it with a strange and tender reverence. He looked at it, then back at her. “Thank you,” he whispered. He didn’t invite her in. He just stood there, holding the ridiculous, brightly-painted gnome as if it were a holy relic. Eleanor nodded, turned, and walked back to her car, the sound of her heels on the pavement no longer a frantic message or a death march, but the quiet, steady beat of a retreat from a world she no longer belonged to, and an advance towards one she was only just beginning to understand.

Back in her car, she didn't start the engine right away. She just sat, her hands resting on the steering wheel, and let the silence of the quiet suburban street settle around her. The encounter had lasted less than five minutes, but it had rewired something fundamental inside her. She had spent her career building walls. Mr. Peterson, with his quiet, trembling grief over a ceramic gnome, had walked right through them without even trying. The satisfaction she felt was nothing like closing a deal or winning a motion. It was a quieter, warmer, and far more complicated feeling. It was the feeling of having done a small, right thing in a world of large, legally-sanctioned wrongs. She pulled out her phone and texted Maya.

*Phase Four: Unsanctioned Diplomatic Resolution. It involved a gnome.*

Maya’s reply was instantaneous. *I KNEW IT! You went rogue! Did you waterboard him with sentiment? Did you achieve total gnome-inance? I need details! Tacos tonight to celebrate your new career as a vigilante of emotional justice?*

Eleanor laughed, a real, unforced laugh that felt like a discovery. *Yes to all of the above. Especially the tacos.* She put the phone down, her smile lingering. She felt lighter. The knot of acrimony in the Chong-Peterson file had been a tiny, insignificant thing in the grand scheme of her firm's portfolio, but untangling it in this way felt more significant than any multi-million dollar merger she had ever negotiated. It was a different kind of victory, one that didn't come with a bonus, but felt infinitely more valuable.

Later that afternoon, back in her office, she dictated a brief memo to her assistant. “Please inform counsel for Mr. Peterson that Mrs. Chong will be making no further claim to the garden gnome, as the item in question has been amicably resolved. No further action is required. Please close the file.” She paused. “And cancel my 4:00 PM. I’m leaving early.”

Instead of heading to Maya's studio, she drove in a direction she hadn't for months. She found herself pulling up outside her mother’s house in the Fraser Valley, a low, sprawling rancher surrounded by an explosion of carefully tended flowerbeds. Her mother was in the front garden, wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat and muddy gloves, snipping delicately at a prize-winning rose bush. She looked up as Eleanor’s Audi pulled into the drive, her expression a mixture of surprise and her default setting of faint disapproval.

“Eleanor. Goodness. Is something wrong? You don’t usually visit on a weekday. Did you get fired?” Her mother pulled off a glove, her eyes scanning Eleanor for any visible signs of distress or failure.

“No, Mom. I didn’t get fired,” Eleanor said, getting out of the car. She walked onto the lawn, her heels sinking into the soft turf. “I just… I was in the area.” It was a lie, but a softer one than she usually told.

“In the area? In a three-hundred-dollar suit? What’s this about?” Her mother’s gaze was as sharp and discerning as the shears in her hand.

Eleanor stopped in front of the rose bush. It was covered in huge, perfect, peach-coloured blossoms. The scent was intoxicating. “I just wanted to see your roses,” she said, and was surprised by the truth in the statement. “You told me this one was having trouble with black spot. It looks… incredible.” She reached out and, very gently, touched the velvety edge of a petal.

Her mother was silent for a moment, her usual briskness momentarily suspended. She looked from Eleanor’s face to the rose bush, a flicker of something uncertain in her eyes. “It was the iron supplements,” she said finally, her voice softer than usual. “The ones I was going to send you. You just have to know what it’s lacking and give it what it needs.” She paused, looking at her daughter, really looking at her. “You look peaky,” she said, but the words lacked their usual critical sting. They sounded, for the first time in a long time, like concern. “Come inside. I’ll make you a cup of tea. And for heaven’s sake, take off those ridiculous shoes before you aerate my entire lawn.”The next morning, the gnome sat on her passenger seat again, its cheerful, idiotic face a stark contrast to the sleek, black leather interior of her Audi. Her plan, formed in the quiet hours of the night after she had cancelled her spin class and instead sat on her balcony listening to the sounds of the city, was simple, direct, and professionally inadvisable.

They sounded, for the first time in a long time, like concern. “Come inside. I’ll make you a cup of tea. And for heaven’s sake, take off those ridiculous shoes before you aerate my entire lawn.”**Chapter 7**

Inside, her mother’s kitchen was exactly as Eleanor remembered it from every visit of her entire adult life: immaculately clean, smelling faintly of bleach and whatever was last baked in it, and organized with a logic so specific and unyielding that moving a salt shaker felt like a violation of a sacred trust. Eleanor took off her sensible heels and placed them neatly on the mat by the door, feeling the cool linoleum under her stockinged feet. The act of removing her shoes, of shedding the first layer of her professional armour, felt significant. Her mother was already at the counter, filling an electric kettle with brisk, efficient movements, her back to Eleanor. The silence wasn't awkward, not yet; it was the familiar, charged silence of two people who communicated more in what they didn't say.

“So,” her mother began, her voice echoing slightly in the tidy room as she measured loose-leaf tea into a porcelain pot. “You settled the gnome business, then?” It wasn’t a question born of curiosity so much as a desire to categorize the disruption, to file it away under ‘Resolved’.

“Yes. I did,” Eleanor replied, taking a seat at the small oak table that had served as the hub of the house for three decades. She watched her mother’s hands, competent and strong, as she poured the boiling water. They were gardener’s hands, the nails short and clean but the skin weathered. They were not hands that shook. “It wasn’t a legal solution.”

Her mother turned, carrying the teapot and two cups to the table. She placed them on cork coasters with practiced precision. “I should hope not. Imagine billing for a trip to a garden centre.” She sat down, her posture perfect, and began to pour the steaming, amber liquid. “So what was it, then? A fit of conscience?” There was an edge to her voice, but it was the familiar edge of a tool being used to probe, not to wound.

Eleanor wrapped her hands around the warm cup. “Something like that,” she admitted, her gaze dropping to the swirling tea. “It felt… pointless. The fighting, the letters, the billable hours. All of it. The man was just sad, Mom. He was grieving and we were calling his grief ‘chattel.’ It felt… wrong.” She finally looked up, meeting her mother’s sharp, intelligent gaze, braced for a lecture on the necessity of professional detachment.

But the lecture didn’t come. Her mother took a slow, deliberate sip of her tea, her eyes unblinking over the rim of the cup. “Your father was like that,” she said, the sudden change in topic so unexpected it was like a shift in the atmospheric pressure. “He wasn’t a lawyer, he was a surveyor, but he dealt with property lines. Fights over two inches of land that had been in families for generations. He’d come home and say, ‘They’re not fighting over the land, Jean. They’re fighting over who was loved more by their grandfather.’ He saw the other thing. The thing underneath.” She placed her cup back in its saucer with a faint click. “It wore him out. Seeing the thing underneath all the time. It’s heavy.”

Eleanor stared at her mother, speechless. In all her life, she could not recall her mother ever volunteering a story about her father that wasn’t a complaint about his untidiness or a funny anecdote about his tone-deaf singing. This was something else entirely. This was a piece of him, a piece of *them*, that had been kept under lock and key. It was a glimpse into a past where her ruthlessly pragmatic mother had understood, and perhaps even loved, a man for his sensitivity.

“You’re like him in that way,” her mother continued, her voice matter-of-fact, as if stating the current temperature. “You try to hide it under all this… efficiency. Your six-minute increments and your meal prep. You build a fortress of it. But the thing underneath is still there. Sooner or later, a crack appears. Sometimes it’s a gnome. Sometimes…” She trailed off, her gaze drifting towards the window, towards the garden. “Sometimes it’s a rose that won’t bloom no matter what you do.”

A new silence fell between them, but this one was different. It was softer, more spacious. It held the weight of her father’s memory, of her mother’s unexpected vulnerability. The fortress was not just Eleanor’s. Her mother had one, too, built of prize-winning roses and no-nonsense advice. And she had just opened a small, previously hidden gate.

“What happened with the duck was…” Eleanor began, the word slipping out before she could stop it. She froze.

Her mother’s eyebrow went up, a single, swift movement. “The duck?” she repeated, her voice dry as dust. “I thought we’d established that was anemia.”

A small, genuine laugh escaped Eleanor’s lips. “Right. The anemia.” She shook her head, a sense of quiet relief washing over her. She didn’t need to explain it all. Her mother, in her own circuitous, pragmatic way, had already understood. She had seen the thing underneath. “It was just a crack, Mom. A very loud, very strange crack.”

“Well,” her mother said, pushing the plate of arrowroot biscuits towards her. “Now you know the wall isn’t as solid as you thought. That’s useful information.” She selected a biscuit for herself. “It means you either have to build a stronger wall, or you learn to live with a breeze coming through.” She took a crisp bite, the sound of the biscuit snapping punctuating her statement with a sharp finality.

They finished their tea. They talked about the weather, about the rising price of groceries, about a cousin’s recent hip replacement. They returned to the safe, solid ground of their usual conversations, but the landscape had been irrevocably altered. When Eleanor stood to leave, her mother walked her to the door. She didn’t offer a hug—hugs were not part of their shared vocabulary—but she placed a hand on Eleanor’s arm, her grip surprisingly firm.

“Book a vacation, Eleanor,” she said, her voice low and serious. “Not a weekend at a spa. A real one. Go somewhere you can’t check your email. Go somewhere the roses are different.” It was an order, but it was wrapped in something that felt undeniably like care.

Driving away, down the long, tree-lined road, Eleanor felt a profound sense of peace settle over her. The visit had been nothing like she’d expected. She hadn’t been fixed or solved or even fully understood, but she had been seen. Her mother’s final words echoed in her mind. *Learn to live with a breeze coming through.* She thought of her perfect, sterile condo, a place designed to keep the world out. She thought of Maya’s studio, a place that was nothing but a huge, open door, letting the world in, in all its rusty, chaotic glory. She drove towards the city, towards her life, no longer certain of the floor plan, but starting, for the first time, to think about renovations.**Chapter 8**

The following Monday, the twelfth-floor office of Vance & Albright felt, for the first time, like it was on the same planet as the rest of the world. Eleanor sat at her desk, the morning sun warming her back through the large, unobstructed window. The blinds were fully, almost defiantly, open. Below, the pond glittered, and the resident ducks went about their business, their little dramas playing out in a silent movie she no longer felt compelled to watch. They had been demoted from existential arbiters back to mere waterfowl, and their presence was now just a fact, as neutral as the colour of the sky. Her focus was on the Albright file, and for the first time in years, the work felt less like a battle to be won through brute force and more like a complex puzzle to be solved with finesse. Her strategy was sharp, but it was also creative, finding leverage in places her old, rigid self would have overlooked. The fortress walls of her mind hadn't just been breached; they’d been replaced with windows, letting in a different kind of light.

At noon, her stomach rumbled, a simple, biological signal she would have previously ignored in favour of another thirty billable minutes. Instead of reaching for the emergency protein bar in her drawer, she stood up, slipped on her jacket, and walked out of her office. She took the main glass elevator down, a smooth, silent descent, and stepped out into the bustling atrium. Instead of turning towards the parkade, she walked out the front doors and into the cool, fresh air. She bought a sandwich from a food truck she had seen every day for three years but never once considered visiting, and sat on a bench near the pond. She ate slowly, watching the office workers hurry past, their faces illuminated by their phones. She felt a strange sense of distance from the person she had been just one week ago, a person who would have seen this scene as a portrait of inefficiency. Now, she just saw people taking a break. A drake waddled hopefully in her direction. Eleanor looked at its emerald head, its beady eye. She tore off a small piece of bread from her sandwich crust, a piece without any mayonnaise, and tossed it onto the grass a few feet away. The duck gobbled it up greedily and looked at her for more. She didn’t offer any. She had made her peace; she was not running a charity.

That evening, the greasy, glorious scent of tacos and grilled onions filled Maya’s studio. They sat on the mismatched stools, paper plates balanced on their knees, a bottle of cheap red wine breathing on the electrical-spool table between them. Maya was listening with rapt attention as Eleanor recounted the tale of the gnome delivery and the subsequent, unnerving détente with her mother. When Eleanor finished, Maya let out a low whistle, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and amusement.

“Whoa. Rogue diplomacy and a maternal breakthrough in the same twenty-four-hour period? Ellie-Bellie, you’re on a roll. You’re like a one-woman truth and reconciliation commission.” She took a large bite of her taco, chewing thoughtfully. “So your mom’s secret origin story is that she’s a duck whisperer, too? Sees the thing underneath? I did not have that on my 2023 bingo card.”

“I don’t think she’d call it that,” Eleanor said, a smile playing on her lips. “She’d probably call it a symptom of poor soil drainage. But yes. It seems my methodical, unshakeable mother might be… methodical and a little bit shaken. Just like me.” She swirled the wine in her glass, a cheap water glass that was now her designated vessel at Maya’s. “She told me I either had to build a stronger wall or learn to live with a breeze coming through.”

“And?” Maya prompted, leaning forward. “Which is it going to be? More caulking or are we installing a screen door?”

“I think I’m tired of building walls,” Eleanor confessed. The admission, spoken aloud in this chaotic, honest space, felt solid. Real. “They’re exhausting to maintain. And they don’t even work. A duck flew through my wall, Maya. A duck. That has to be a sign that my architectural methods are fundamentally flawed.” She took a sip of wine. “I think I’m ready for the breeze. Even if it messes up my hair and blows papers all over my desk.”

Maya’s grin was triumphant. She raised her glass in a toast. “To the breeze,” she declared. “May it be ever in your favour and carry with it the scent of tacos and turpentine.” They clinked their glasses, the sound a dull thud in the vast studio. “So what’s the first order of business for the newly un-fortified Eleanor Vance? Are you going to quit your job and become a professional gnome mediator?”

“No,” Eleanor laughed. “I’m good at my job. I think I might even be better at it now. But my mother… she also told me to book a vacation.”

“A real one?” Maya asked, her eyebrows shooting up. “Not one of those ‘long weekend to research international tax law in a different climate’ things?”

“A real one,” Eleanor confirmed. “Go somewhere I can’t check my email. Go somewhere the roses are different.” The words felt like an instruction manual she was only just learning to read.

Later that night, back in her own quiet condo, the idea took root. The space no longer felt sterile; it felt expectant. It was a blank canvas. She sat on her beige linen sofa, her laptop open on the coffee table. She opened a travel website. Her fingers, trained by years of meticulous research, hovered over the search fields. Her mind immediately started to build a framework: optimal travel dates, cost-benefit analysis of different destinations, cross-referencing hotel reviews to create a tiered list of potential lodgings. The old Eleanor was trying to plan this vacation, to partition it into six-minute increments of scheduled fun. She closed her eyes for a moment, took a breath, and let it go. She cleared the search fields. She didn’t type in a city or a country. She just clicked on a link that said ‘Explore Destinations.’ The screen filled with a mosaic of images: turquoise oceans, snow-capped mountains, bustling, colourful markets. Her eyes scanned the images, not with an analytical mind, but with a simple sense of curiosity. A picture caught her eye. It was a narrow, cobblestone street, impossibly steep, with a vintage yellow tram climbing it like a weary beetle. Buildings painted in ochre and rose and pale blue were crowded together, their laundry hanging from wrought-iron balconies like festive banners. It was chaotic, vibrant, ancient, and utterly inefficient. It was Lisbon. A breeze seemed to stir in the still air of her condo. Without creating a spreadsheet, without reading a single review, without a moment more of hesitation, Eleanor Vance clicked on the flight. She entered her details, her fingers moving with a new and unfamiliar certainty. The confirmation page loaded, a monument not to her efficiency, but to her surrender. She had booked a one-way ticket. The return could wait.The confirmation email sat in Eleanor’s inbox, a single line of text that held more explosive power than all fifty-seven pages of the separation agreement combined. *Confirmation: YVR to LIS. One Way.* She stared at it, her morning coffee growing cold in her hands. The terror that prickled her skin was a ghost of what she had felt by the pond, a faint, phantom echo. It was overshadowed by a dizzying, terrifying, and utterly unfamiliar sense of lightness. For her entire adult life, every action had been a calculated step on a meticulously planned path. She had just dynamited the path, the map, and the concept of a final destination, all with a single, impulsive click. She had not planned for this. The realization filled her not with panic, but with a profound, giddy sense of freedom. The future was no longer a foregone conclusion written in six-minute billing increments; it was a blank page.

Her first call was to Maya. She didn’t bother with a preamble. “I booked a one-way ticket to Lisbon,” she said into the phone, the words feeling both foreign and perfectly natural on her tongue. There was a beat of stunned silence on the other end, followed by a sound like a small explosion as Maya apparently dropped something heavy. “YOU DID WHAT?” Maya’s voice boomed, a mixture of disbelief and pure, unadulterated glee. “A one-way ticket? Ellie-Bellie, you beautiful, impulsive lunatic! That’s the most punk-rock thing you’ve ever done! When do you leave? We have to have a party. A ‘Destruction of the Old Life’ party. I’ll make a piñata shaped like a briefcase. We’ll burn your meal plans in a sacred fire!” The sheer, unconditional joy in her friend’s voice was the final validation Eleanor needed. This wasn’t an act of madness. It was an act of profound and necessary self-rescue, and Maya was already gathering the life rafts and the champagne.

The harder conversation came a few hours later. She didn’t schedule a meeting or draft a memo. She simply walked down the hall to Mr. Albright’s office, his door, as always, slightly ajar. He was on the phone, his voice a low, intimidating rumble. He glanced up, saw her standing there, and ended his call with a clipped, “Handle it.” He motioned her in. “Vance. What is it? You have that look on your face you get when you’ve found a loophole that’s going to cost someone a million dollars.” Eleanor stepped inside, closing the door softly behind her. The room was the epitome of old-school legal power: dark wood, leather-bound books, a faint scent of cigar smoke from a bygone era. “Mr. Albright,” she began, her voice steady, “I need to request an indefinite leave of absence.”

He stared at her, his expression unreadable, his heavy brows furrowed. “Indefinite?” he repeated, the word hanging in the air like a judgment. “That’s not a word we use in this business. We use dates. Deadlines. End points.” Eleanor met his gaze without flinching. “I know. But I don’t have one. I’ve performed well for this firm. I’ve billed more hours than anyone in this department for the last three years. I’ve made my mistake, and I’ve fixed it. But I need… a breeze. And I can’t get one on a two-week, pre-approved vacation.” She didn’t mention the duck. She didn’t mention the gnome. She didn’t have to. He had seen her unravel, and he had seen her stitch herself back together into something stronger.

Mr. Albright leaned back in his enormous leather chair, his fingertips steepled under his chin. He studied her for a long, silent moment, his gaze analytical, as if he were assessing a hostile witness. “This is career suicide, you know that,” he said, his voice flat. “The partners won’t understand ‘a breeze.’ They understand burnout, they understand maternity leave, they understand poaching attempts from rival firms. They do not understand poetic epiphanies.” He paused. “But I do.” He let out a long, slow breath. “My wife left me for a yoga instructor twenty years ago. I worked eighty hours a week for the next six months. Had a heart attack at my desk. My doctor told me to take up a hobby. I bought a boat. A ridiculous, expensive, time-consuming boat. Saved my life.” He looked out his own window, at the distant line of the mountains. “Go to… wherever you’re going. Your leave is granted. But it’s not indefinite. I’ll give you six months. After that, your position is no longer guaranteed. Go find your boat, Vance. Just make sure you know how to sail it home.”

Returning to her own office, Eleanor felt as though she were floating. The view of the pond, the neat stacks of files, the hum of her computer—it was all suddenly imbued with a sense of temporary, beautiful nostalgia. It was a life she had lived, and lived well, but it was no longer the only life she could imagine for herself. She had been granted not just permission, but a blessing of sorts, from the most unlikely of sources. The fortress had not only been breached, it had been honourably discharged from service.

That evening, she stood before her closet. It was a cathedral of sensible neutrals: a dozen charcoal grey suits, a fleet of silk blouses in shades of cream and navy, a row of identical black heels. It was the uniform of a woman who had armour-plated her life. For a moment, she was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of it, the material weight of the person she had been. She wasn’t sure where to begin. Packing for a two-week trip was a science she had mastered. Packing for an indefinite future was something else entirely. She reached past the suits, her hand searching in the back, for something she hadn’t seen in years. Her fingers brushed against silk. She pulled it out. It was a scarf, bought on a university trip to Barcelona, in shades of vibrant, impossible blue and gold. It was loud, impractical, and joyful. She had never worn it. It didn’t go with anything she owned. She took the scarf and draped it over the handles of an empty suitcase that sat on the floor. It was the first thing she packed. The first and, for now, the only thing. It was a start.The scarf lay in the bottom of the suitcase like a brightly coloured promise. Eleanor then turned to face the closet, a monolithic block of grey and navy. Her army of suits. For a moment, the sheer financial and emotional investment they represented was paralyzing. They were the cost of her fortress. With a decisiveness that felt borrowed from Maya, she began pulling them from their hangers. She didn't fold them. She piled them on the bed—wool, silk, gabardine—an expensive, somber mountain. She found a box and packed up her law books, the ones from university, their pages filled with her neat, hopeful highlighting. Everything else—the severe blouses, the sensible shoes, the entire wardrobe of a woman she was no longer sure she wanted to be—she packed into large donation bags. The act was swift and ruthless, a vivisection not of a marriage, but of an identity. By the end, her closet was nearly empty, holding only a few pairs of jeans, some soft sweaters, and a pair of worn-in boots she hadn't touched in years. The room felt bigger, the air lighter.

Her final week at the office was a strange, out-of-body experience. She was a ghost haunting her own life, methodically dismantling her professional existence. She delegated files with a newfound grace, taking the time to explain the nuances to the junior associates she had previously seen as little more than cogs in the billing machine. The Albright merger, her crowning achievement, she handed over to Robert. She called him into her office, and he entered with the nervous energy of a student summoned to the principal. She laid out the entire strategy for him, pointing out the traps and the opportunities, treating him not as an underling but as a peer. "It's your file now, Robert," she said, closing the binder. "You're ready. Don't let them push you around." The look of shocked, dawning confidence on his face was a better bonus than any she had ever received. On her last day, her desk was clear, her computer wiped. All that remained was a small, framed photo of Maya making a ridiculous face, and a single, perfect, peach-coloured rose from her mother's garden, which had appeared on her desk that morning with no note.

The "Destruction of the Old Life" party was exactly as chaotic and wonderful as Maya had promised. It took place in the yard behind the studio, a patch of gravel and weeds illuminated by strings of colourful lights Maya had salvaged from a defunct mini-golf course. A bonfire crackled merrily in a rusted oil drum. The briefcase piñata, filled with cheap chocolate and tiny plastic ducks, was mercilessly beaten to a pulp by a small, laughing crowd of Maya’s artist friends. Eleanor, wine glass in hand, watched it all with a smile that felt permanently affixed to her face. When Maya produced a stack of her laminated weekly schedules—the ones detailing her spin classes, meal preps, and scheduled "downtime"—Eleanor took them without a word. She walked to the oil drum, the plastic sheets curling in the heat before she even let them go. She dropped them into the flames, and the fire roared, consuming the rigid architecture of her former life in a blast of toxic-smelling smoke. Someone cheered. Maya wrapped an arm around her shoulder, her hug smelling of welding fumes and victory. "Welcome to the breeze, Ellie-Bellie," she whispered.

On the morning of her flight, after the last of the bags were packed and the keys to her now-sublet condo were handed over, she found herself with an hour to spare. On an impulse, she drove one last time towards the office park. She didn’t get out of the car. She just parked in her old spot and looked at the pond. The morning was bright, the water sparkling. A familiar drake—or one just like him, it didn’t matter—was preening on the grass, utterly oblivious to the profound, life-altering role it had played in the drama of a human it would never know. Eleanor watched it for a long moment, this small, feathered catalyst. There was no fear, no judgment, not even amusement. There was only a quiet sense of gratitude. The duck had been a mirror, and while the reflection had been terrifying, it had also been true. It had shown her the cracks, and in doing so, had given her the chance to let in the light. With a final, silent thank you, she put the car in drive and pulled away, not looking back.

At the airport, she was unburdened. Her heavy leather briefcase was gone, replaced by a simple backpack. Her one rolling suitcase was small and maneuverable. The vibrant blue and gold of the Barcelona scarf was tied to the handle, a bright flag of her new independence. She was just Eleanor, a woman with a backpack and a one-way ticket. As she walked towards the security line, she passed a newsstand. Her eyes caught a magazine cover, a feature on the city’s top corporate lawyers. A younger, sterner version of herself stared back from a group photo, her face a mask of polished competence. The woman in the photo was a stranger, a relic from an excavation of a life already buried. Eleanor smiled, a small, secret smile, and kept walking towards her gate, towards the vast, unknown, and beautifully unplanned expanse of the sky.**Chapter 9**

The first breath of Lisbon air was a shock to the system. After ten hours sealed in the climate-controlled, recycled atmosphere of the airplane, the air that greeted her on the jet bridge was a thick, humid cocktail of jet fuel, salt, and something vaguely floral. The sounds were different, too; the smooth, rounded vowels of Portuguese replacing the clipped consonants of North American English, turning the airport’s ambient chatter into a kind of music she didn’t understand. For a dizzying moment, standing in the arrivals hall with her small suitcase and her backpack, Eleanor felt the old panic flicker. She was utterly alone, in a place where she knew no one, with no itinerary, no hotel reservation, no plan. The old Eleanor would have seen this as a catastrophic failure of preparation. The new Eleanor took a slow, deep breath, held it for a second, and found that the panic tasted, remarkably, like excitement.

She bypassed the pre-booked shuttle services and corporate car rentals, a phalanx of efficiency she would once have navigated with ease, and instead followed the signs for the taxi rank. The driver of the scuffed, cream-coloured Mercedes that pulled up was a grizzled man with a magnificent mustache who greeted her torrent of polite, carefully enunciated English with a cheerful nod and a rapid-fire burst of Portuguese, gesturing for her to get in. As they pulled out into the city’s traffic, Eleanor was pressed back against the worn leather seat. Lisbon didn’t unfold in an orderly grid; it swirled and climbed and plunged. Buildings in shades of sun-faded ochre and rose rushed past, their facades a riot of intricate tilework and elegant decay. Graffiti, vibrant and artistic, bloomed over ancient stone walls. The taxi roared up impossibly steep hills, the engine complaining, and then dove down narrow, cobblestoned lanes with a recklessness that made her grip the armrest. It was chaotic, inefficient, and breathtakingly alive. This was a city that had not been designed by a committee; it had grown, layer upon messy layer, over centuries.

The driver dropped her in a sprawling, sun-drenched square, the Praça dos Restauradores, its mosaic pavements dizzying her eyes. He helped her with her bag, accepted her euros with another stream of friendly, incomprehensible Portuguese, and sped away, leaving her standing alone on the curb. She was a small, quiet island in a river of motion. Across the square, a familiar, international hotel chain beckoned, a safe harbor of predictable comfort and bland corporate décor. The temptation was immense. It promised an easy check-in, a reliable internet connection, and a room that could be anywhere in the world. It promised the absence of challenge. With a resolve that felt both new and fragile, she turned her back on it. She picked up her suitcase, the Barcelona scarf a bright flag of intent, and began to walk, pulling the case over the grooved, uneven stones, heading away from the grand avenue and into a warren of smaller side streets.

She found it on the third street she tried, tucked between a tiny grocery shop overflowing with olives and dried fish and a closed-curtain doorway from which the faint, melancholy notes of a guitar could be heard. It was a *pensão*, a guesthouse, its name painted in faded blue letters on a single tile above the door. A steep, narrow staircase led up from the street. An elderly woman with eyes as bright and dark as olives greeted her from behind a small wooden desk, her smile revealing a flash of gold. Communication was a clumsy, charming pantomime of gestures and single, shared words—'quarto,' 'banho,' 'sim'—but ten minutes later, Eleanor was being shown to a room on the top floor. It was small and simple, the floor a beautiful pattern of worn, blue-and-white tiles. A pair of wooden shutters opened onto a tiny, wrought-iron balcony just wide enough for one person to stand. The bed was covered with a heavy, embroidered quilt, and the air smelled faintly of lemon wax and old wood. It was imperfect, and it was the most wonderful room she had ever stayed in.

Without unpacking, without even taking off her shoes, she went back out. The jet lag was a heavy cloak on her shoulders, but a deeper, more urgent need propelled her forward: the need to simply be in this place. She let the city pull her along. She wandered into the Alfama district, a medieval labyrinth where the streets became so narrow she could touch the buildings on both sides. The scent of grilled sardines wafted from a tiny restaurant. An old woman in a black dress watered a pot of bright red geraniums on her windowsill and nodded at Eleanor as she passed. The sounds of life were everywhere: a heated argument from an open window, the laughter of children kicking a soccer ball against a crumbling church wall, the mournful, beautiful cry of a Fado singer practicing in a darkened bar. She was getting hopelessly, gloriously lost, and for the first time in her life, she had no desire to find her way back.

It was the smell that stopped her, a warm, sweet perfume of caramelized sugar and cinnamon. It led her to a tiny, hole-in-the-wall bakery, its counter laden with golden, blistered pastries. She pointed, paid a few coins, and was handed a *pastel de nata*, still warm from the oven. She took a bite, standing right there on the cobblestones. The crust shattered into a thousand flaky layers, the custard was a rich, decadent wave of warmth and sweetness, and the scorched top added a hint of bitter complexity. It was simple, perfect, and profoundly real. It was a pleasure that required no analysis, no justification. It was the taste of surrender.

As dusk began to bleed purple and rose into the sky, she found her way back to her *pensão*, guided by a mixture of luck and burgeoning instinct. From her small balcony, she watched the city lights begin to flicker on, one by one, across the sea of terracotta roofs. The mournful Fado music from next door started up again, a soundtrack for the falling night. She was thousands of miles from everything she had ever known, standing in a room she hadn’t known existed that morning, with no plans for the next day, or the day after that. She was completely, utterly unmoored. And as she leaned against the cool iron of the railing, listening to the ancient, sad, beautiful music of a city she was only just beginning to meet, she felt an overwhelming sense of peace. She was a blank page in a very old book, and she had all the time in the world to write the next chapter.**Chapter 10**

Eleanor woke not to the pre-programmed chimes of an alarm, but to a shaft of buttery sunlight falling across her face and the complex, layered sounds of a city coming to life. A cacophony of church bells rang out from different directions, their tones overlapping in a slightly dissonant, beautiful harmony. Below her window, she could hear the clatter of a delivery truck on the cobblestones, the rhythmic calls of a street vendor, and the murmur of conversations she couldn't parse. For a long, luxurious moment, she lay still under the heavy quilt, simply listening. There was no agenda waiting for her, no schedule to adhere to, no list of tasks to be efficiently dispatched. The day was a vast, unstructured expanse, a concept so foreign that it felt like a form of wealth she had never known she was poor in.

After a simple breakfast of strong coffee and bread at the tiny grocery shop next door, a meal purchased with smiles and pointing, she set out again with no destination in mind. Her only piece of equipment was a small, worn city map she had found in her room, but she decided to keep it folded in her pocket, a safety net she was determined not to use. She walked with a new gait, slower, more observant, her head up. She was no longer a lawyer navigating a direct route between two points; she was a collector of details. She noticed the way an elderly man carefully polished the brass knocker on his front door, the intricate patterns of rust staining the side of a building, the flash of bright blue on a jay's wing as it flitted between overflowing window boxes. These were the footnotes of life she had never had time to read, and she found them endlessly fascinating.

Her wandering eventually led her uphill, through a maze of steep, winding alleys, until she emerged, breathless, onto a wide terrace overlooking the city. A sign identified it as the *Miradouro da Senhora do Monte*, the highest viewpoint in Lisbon. The view was staggering. The entire city unfolded beneath her, a sprawling tapestry of red-tiled roofs flowing down to the wide, glittering expanse of the Tagus River. The iconic 25 de Abril Bridge hung suspended in the distance, a miniature Golden Gate, and the whole scene was bathed in the clear, brilliant light that seemed unique to this place. She found an empty spot on a tile-covered bench and sat, simply absorbing the panorama. She pulled out her phone, not to check emails or messages, but out of old habit. A ghost notification from her work calendar popped up on the screen: *Weekly Partners' Strategy Meeting. 10:00 AM PST.* The letters were small and grey, a message from a distant galaxy. She felt a faint, clinical curiosity, imagining the scene in the boardroom, the serious faces, the talk of billable hours and quarterly projections. There was no anxiety, no regret, not even a twinge of schadenfreude. There was only a profound and peaceful sense of dislocation. That life belonged to someone else now. With a flick of her thumb, she deleted the calendar app entirely, the icon vanishing with a small, satisfying poof.

It was on that same viewpoint that she saw a small, hand-painted sign leaning against a wall, written in chalk on a piece of slate. It featured a crude drawing of a tile and the words *'Aula de Azulejo - Hoje'* followed by a time and an address just down the hill. A tile-painting class. Today. The idea was absurd. She had no artistic talent; her creativity had been channeled exclusively into finding loopholes in contracts. It was inefficient. It served no practical purpose. It was perfect. She took a picture of the sign, a primitive form of note-taking that felt liberatingly inexact, and decided that would be her plan. She would spend the afternoon trying to replicate a centuries-old art form with clumsy, unpracticed hands.

Later, in a small, dusty workshop that smelled of clay and pigment, she sat at a long wooden table with five other people—a young Australian couple, two quiet German women, and the instructor, a woman named Sofia with paint-stained fingers and a radiant smile. Sofia spoke passionate, fractured English, guiding them through the process of painting their own traditional Portuguese tile. Eleanor chose a simple, geometric design in blue and yellow. Her hand, so accustomed to the precise slash of a pen, was clumsy with the delicate brush. Her lines were wobbly, the colour bled outside the pattern, and her first attempt was a complete mess. She felt the old, familiar sting of incompetence, the voice of the inner critic rising up to condemn her for her failure. But then she looked around the table. The Australian boy had dripped blue paint all over his yellow sun. One of the German women was laughing as she tried to wipe away a smear with her thumb. No one was striving for perfection. They were simply playing with colour, enjoying the slow, meditative process of creation. Taking a deep breath, Eleanor wiped her tile clean and began again. This time, she didn't focus on the result. She focused on the feel of the brush, the cool smoothness of the ceramic, the intense, brilliant cobalt of the paint. Her lines were still uneven, but she didn’t care. She was not building a monument to efficiency; she was just making a tile. And when it was done, a lopsided, imperfect, but undeniably cheerful square of blue and yellow, she held it in her hands and felt a quiet, unfamiliar pride. It was the first thing she had made in her entire adult life that wasn't a legal document. That evening, back in her room, she sent a single photo to Maya. It was a picture of the tile, still wet, sitting on the tiled floor of her room, her own slightly paint-stained fingers holding it steady. Her caption was three simple words: *Making new walls.*Maya’s reply arrived in the middle of the night, a simple message that made Eleanor smile in the darkness of her room: *That’s the most beautiful wall you’ve ever built.* The days that followed settled into a rhythm that wasn't a schedule. It was a gentle, unforced cadence dictated by sun, appetite, and curiosity. Each morning began with a coffee and a nod from the shop owner, who had learned to have her *pastel de nata* ready. She would then simply walk, choosing a direction based on whim. She discovered hidden courtyards where laundry lines crisscrossed like spiderwebs, tiny bookstores piled high with dusty volumes, and parks where old men played cards with a fierce, silent concentration. She learned to navigate by landmarks both grand and humble—the imposing São Jorge Castle on its hill, the chatter of the green parrots in the Jardim da Estrela, the specific shade of blue on a door she found particularly pleasing. She wasn't a tourist ticking off a list; she was a student of the city, and her curriculum was life itself.

A few days later, she made her way back to the tile workshop to collect her piece, which Sofia had promised would be fired and ready. The familiar smell of clay and warm dust greeted her as she stepped inside. Sofia was there, wiping down a table, her hair tied up in a brightly coloured scarf. She broke into a wide smile upon seeing Eleanor. "Ah, the lawyer with the secret artist inside! Your *azulejo*, it is ready." She retrieved it from a shelf crowded with other finished pieces. In Eleanor's hands, the tile felt transformed. The firing process had deepened the colours, the blue now a rich, liquid cobalt, the yellow a splash of pure sun. The glaze gave it a glossy, satisfying weight. Her wobbly lines were still there, her smudges forever sealed beneath the surface, but they no longer looked like mistakes. They looked like proof of a human hand. They gave the tile a hesitant, vulnerable character that a perfectly executed piece would have lacked.

Sofia looked at it with her head tilted, a professional assessing a student's work. "You see?" she said, pointing a paint-stained finger at a particularly shaky line. "Here, your hand was afraid. But here," she moved to a curve that was slightly more confident, "you started to enjoy it. It is not a perfect tile. It is a tile that tells a story. It is better." She wrapped it carefully in newspaper. As Eleanor paid her, Sofia hesitated for a moment. "My friends and I, we go for a drink after we close the shop. To a small place, for *ginjinha*. It is a cherry liqueur, very sweet, very strong. You come?"

The invitation was so casual, so unexpected, that Eleanor’s old programming immediately kicked in. A dozen excuses formed in her mind: she had plans, she was tired, she wouldn’t want to impose. They were the polite, protective barriers she had always used to keep the messiness of spontaneous human connection at a safe distance. She opened her mouth to deploy one of them, but then she caught sight of her own reflection in the dusty shop window. She saw a woman with a little more sun on her face, whose shoulders were relaxed, whose eyes were not scanning for threats or obligations. She saw a woman who had booked a one-way ticket to a country she’d never seen. That woman would not say no. “I’d love to,” Eleanor heard herself say, the words feeling both terrifying and exhilarating.

The place was not a bar, but a tiny, standing-room-only storefront called A Ginjinha, a local institution. Sofia greeted the man behind the counter like an old friend and returned with two small glasses filled with a dark red liquid and a single, alcohol-soaked cherry at the bottom. The first sip was a shock—intensely sweet, intensely alcoholic, and undeniably delicious. Soon, Sofia’s friends arrived, a cheerful, boisterous group of artists and artisans who greeted Eleanor with easy handshakes and rapid, smiling Portuguese. They were sculptors, leatherworkers, and jewelers, their hands calloused and stained, their clothes comfortable and paint-splattered. Eleanor stood amongst them, a quiet island in a sea of creative energy, feeling entirely out of her depth and yet, somehow, completely welcome. They made room for her in their circle, switching to a charmingly broken English for her benefit, asking her not what she *did*, but what she had *seen* that day.

Later, as the group began to disperse, Eleanor and Sofia shared a second glass. "So," Sofia said, leaning against the counter. "You are not a lawyer on vacation. I can see it. You are… searching." It wasn't a question, but a simple statement of fact. "I was an architect," she continued, swirling the cherry in her glass. "For a big firm. I drew straight lines all day. So many straight lines. They paid me very well to draw straight lines. One day, I realized I was spending all my money on things to make me forget how much I hated drawing straight lines." She smiled, a wry, self-deprecating expression. "So I quit. I opened the shop. Now I teach strangers to make beautiful, wobbly lines. I am poorer. And I have never been happier."

Eleanor didn’t need to tell Sofia her whole story, about the ducks or the gnomes or the fortress of her former life. She just nodded, the taste of sweet cherry on her tongue, and met Sofia’s knowing gaze. "I understand," she said. And she did. The connection forged between them was not based on shared experience, but on a shared understanding of what it meant to walk away from a life that no longer fit. As Eleanor walked back to her *pensão* through the lamplit streets, the city felt different. It was no longer just a beautiful, ancient backdrop for her solitary journey. It was now a place that held the possibility of friendship, of shared stories, of belonging. The breeze her mother had spoken of was no longer just something to be weathered; it was a current, and for the first time, Eleanor felt it gently, but insistently, carrying her forward.The weeks that followed were a quiet education in the art of living without a destination. The initial euphoria of escape softened into a steadier, more profound contentment. Eleanor’s days found their own gentle, unforced rhythm. Mornings were for Portuguese lessons in a small, crowded classroom where she, along with a handful of other foreigners, stumbled through the beautiful, frustrating complexities of verb conjugations. Her professor, a stern but patient woman named Inês, would rap her knuckles on the table and say, “Não, não, Eleanor. You think with the head of a lawyer. The language must be felt in the heart.” It was a familiar critique, and Eleanor would smile, finding a strange joy in her own ineptitude. She was a beginner again, stripped of her expertise, and the humility was cleansing. Afternoons were often spent at Sofia’s workshop, where she had become a quiet, unofficial apprentice. She would sit for hours, patiently practicing the precise, steady brushstrokes required for the intricate tile patterns, finding a deep, meditative calm in the focused, manual work. She was still not good, but she was slowly, incrementally, becoming less bad, and that felt like a victory of a different kind.

Her friendship with Sofia and her circle of artisans deepened from a casual acquaintance into a genuine connection. She was invited to sprawling, chaotic dinners in drafty apartments, where the wine flowed freely and the conversation, a boisterous mix of Portuguese and English, was about art, politics, love, and the rising cost of rent. She was a quiet observer at first, the corporate lawyer still a ghost at the table, unsure of how to contribute to a conversation that didn’t involve contracts or case law. But they drew her in with their warmth and their genuine curiosity about her. They didn't care about her billable hours or her career trajectory; they wanted to know what she thought of the fado she had heard, or the book she was reading. They were interested in the person, not the profession. Slowly, she began to find her voice, contributing tentative opinions and eventually, telling her own stories, amazed to find that they were interesting to people even without the gloss of professional success. She was becoming a part of their beautiful, messy, creative ecosystem.

One rainy Tuesday afternoon, she sat on the worn velvet armchair in her room at the *pensão*, a video call open on her laptop. Maya’s face filled the screen, her familiar, chaotic studio visible in the background, a new, half-finished metal sculpture looming behind her like a robotic dinosaur. The connection was glitchy, Maya’s voice cutting in and out, but her energy was so powerful it seemed to physically bridge the thousands of miles between them. “Ellie-Bellie! You look… relaxed. It’s creeping me out. Where’s the tension in your jaw? Did you trade it for a tile and a lifetime supply of cherry liqueur?” Eleanor laughed, a sound that was easier and more frequent now. She angled the laptop to show Maya her small, simple room, the view of the wet, glistening rooftops from her balcony. “This is it. Home base for Operation Breeze.” Maya’s grin was huge. “I love it. It’s the exact opposite of your condo. There’s not a single shade of greige in sight. But listen, El, I have to ask the responsible-friend question. I love that you’re living your best bohemian-artist-in-exile life, but what’s the long-term plan? Albright’s six months isn’t forever. You can’t just paint wobbly tiles and eat pastries until your money runs out. Or can you? Because if you can, I need to know your secret.”

The question didn't trigger the panic it would have a month ago. It landed as a practical, loving inquiry. Eleanor looked around her room, at the few clothes she owned hanging on a simple wooden rack, at the small stack of Portuguese books on her nightstand, at the single, imperfect tile that sat on her windowsill like a small, personal coat of arms. Her life had been reduced to what could fit in a suitcase and a small room, and she had never felt richer. But Maya was right. This state of limbo, as beautiful as it was, was a transition, not a destination. “I don’t know,” she admitted, and the words held no shame. “I don’t have a plan. For the first time in my life, I’m okay with not having a plan. But I know I can’t stay here forever.” She paused, a new thought, vague and unformed, beginning to take shape in her mind. “The *pensão* is wonderful, but it’s a room. It feels… temporary. I feel like I need a place to put my books. A kitchen to cook in. A door with my own key.” Maya’s eyes lit up on the screen. “You’re talking about getting an apartment. You’re talking about putting down roots. In Lisbon.” The idea, spoken aloud by her friend, suddenly felt solid. Real. It wasn’t a plan for the next five years, but it was a plan for the next season. It was a commitment not to a job or a career, but to a place and a way of life that was just beginning to feel like her own.

That conversation acted as a gentle but necessary catalyst. The next day, Eleanor sat with Sofia in a sun-drenched café, a half-finished espresso and a crumpled napkin covered in Portuguese rental vocabulary between them. She explained her conversation with Maya, her nascent desire for a place of her own, a small piece of this city she could inhabit more permanently. Sofia listened, nodding, her expression serious and thoughtful. She understood the difference between visiting and staying, between observing a life and beginning to live one. She tapped the napkin with her finger. “To rent a place here, it is not easy for a foreigner with no job, no history. They want contracts, guarantees. They want straight lines.” She saw the flicker of disappointment in Eleanor’s face and held up a hand. “But, this is Lisbon. The straight lines are for the tourists and the big companies. The real city works on trust. On people. Let me ask around. My cousin’s friend, her uncle owns a few small apartments in Graça. Old ones. With problems. But with soul.” The offer was a lifeline, a key not just to a potential apartment, but to the inner workings of the city, a world that operated on a network of relationships, not transactions. It was a world Eleanor was slowly, tentatively, being invited into. Sofia pulled out her phone and began to type a rapid-fire message, her thumb flying across the screen. A few minutes later, she looked up, a triumphant smile on her face. “He has a place. Empty for a month. A top floor, a *mansarda*. He says the roof leaks when it rains very hard and the water pressure is a tragedy. But the view… the view, he says, will break your heart.”A few days later, Eleanor found herself climbing another one of Lisbon's characteristically steep hills, this time with Sofia as her guide. They were in Graça, a neighborhood that felt even more authentically local and less polished than the Alfama. The streets were narrower, the graffiti more political, and the air was thick with the scent of grilling fish from lunchtime tascas and the sound of caged canaries singing on balconies. Sofia navigated the maze of streets with an expert's ease, greeting shopkeepers and neighbors as they passed, her presence a living passport for Eleanor into this close-knit community. The address led them to a tall, narrow building painted a faded, sun-bleached rose, its facade adorned with beautiful but chipped tiles. There was no elevator, only a winding, dark wooden staircase that seemed to groan under their feet as they ascended, each flight revealing another layer of the building’s history in the form of worn patches on the walls and the faint, lingering smells of countless family dinners.

On the top floor, a short, barrel-chested man with a kind, weathered face and hands like gnarled olive branches was waiting for them. This was Senhor Ramiro, the uncle. He greeted Sofia with a warm embrace and Eleanor with a curious, searching gaze. He spoke no English, so Sofia acted as translator, her voice a bridge between their two worlds. Senhor Ramiro unlocked a heavy wooden door and pushed it open, gesturing for them to enter. The apartment was small, an attic space tucked directly under the eaves of the building. The walls were whitewashed but uneven, the floors were wide planks of dark wood that sloped gently towards the center of the room, and the kitchen was a tiny alcove with a two-burner stove and a sink that looked original to the building. It was, by every objective measure Eleanor’s former self would have used, a deeply flawed and impractical living space.

But then, Senhor Ramiro walked across the sloping floor to the far wall and threw open a pair of weathered blue shutters. And the world fell away. The view was not just a view; it was a living, breathing masterpiece. From this high vantage point, the city sprawled out in an impossibly beautiful panorama, a sea of terracotta roofs tumbling down to the sparkling river. The São Jorge Castle stood sentinel on its opposing hill, and the entire scene was framed by the wide, impossibly blue sky. The light that poured into the small room was brilliant and alive, illuminating every dust mote dancing in the air, turning the flawed little apartment into a sacred space. Eleanor walked to the window as if in a trance. She could feel the breeze on her face, hear the distant, layered sounds of the city. This was what Sofia’s cousin’s friend’s uncle had meant. The view didn’t just break your heart; it remade it. Senhor Ramiro watched her face, a knowing smile playing on his lips. Sofia translated his quiet words. “He says the rent is fair. He does not need papers or contracts. He needs a tenant who will care for the place, who understands that old things need patience. He looks at you, and he says he thinks you understand.”

Eleanor looked from the breathtaking view to the kind, weathered face of the old man, and then to Sofia, her friend, who had led her here. She was being offered more than an apartment; she was being offered a place, a home, based on a gut feeling and a shared understanding of the value of imperfect things. Her former life had been governed by contracts designed to mitigate risk and eliminate trust. This transaction was the opposite; it was built entirely on trust, a fragile, human agreement to share a small, flawed, beautiful piece of the world. The choice was between a life of professional certainties and one of personal faith. "Sim," Eleanor said, the Portuguese word feeling solid and right on her tongue. "Yes. I'll take it."

The deal was sealed not with a signature on a fifty-seven-page lease agreement, but with a firm, heartfelt handshake with Senhor Ramiro and a glass of his homemade *ginjinha*, which he produced from a cupboard in the hall. An hour later, Eleanor stood alone in the empty, sun-drenched *mansarda*, a heavy, old-fashioned iron key clutched in her hand. The air smelled of dust, old wood, and the faint, sweet promise of rain on the wind. The roof might leak. The water pressure might be a tragedy. Her future was still a vast, unwritten landscape. But for the first time in her life, she felt truly, profoundly, and irrevocably home. She walked to the open window, leaned on the sill, and looked out at the city that had, against all odds, claimed her. The breeze was coming through, and she was no longer afraid. She was ready.
