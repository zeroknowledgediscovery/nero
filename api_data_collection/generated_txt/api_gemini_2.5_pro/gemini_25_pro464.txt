The water was a slap of black silk. Cold, not with the vicious bite of winter, but the deep, indifferent chill of an early Ottawa autumn. Detective Inspector Isabelle Greenfield cut through it, her arms carving rhythmic, powerful arcs in the pre-dawn gloom of Dow's Lake. This was her church, her confession booth, the only place the city’s grime couldn’t cling. Stroke, breathe, stroke, breathe. The rhythm was a mantra, scrubbing her mind clean of the faces, the files, the lingering scent of decay that was her daily bread. She was a swimmer. It was the first thing she was, before cop, before daughter, before the tired woman who sometimes stared back from the mirror. In the water, she was pure motion, a body cleaving a path through resistance. It was the only honest fight she knew.

Her phone, left on a flat rock by the water’s edge and sealed in a waterproof bag, began to vibrate. The noise was an obscenity in the quiet air, a frantic buzzing that meant the world was refusing to wait. With a final, lung-burning push, she swam to the shore, her body steaming in the cool air as she hauled herself out. Water streamed from her hair, her limbs. She felt the familiar ache in her shoulders, a good pain. A clean pain. She fumbled the phone out of its plastic prison. The screen glowed with the name: Superintendent Davies. A call at 05:30 from the Super was never a social one.

“Greenfield,” she answered, her voice still rough from the effort of the swim.

“Izzy. Get in. Now.” The voice on the other end was stripped of all pleasantries, a frayed wire of exhaustion and urgency. “We’ve got something. I don’t even know what to call it, but it’s landed on my desk and it stinks. It stinks worse than anything I’ve smelled in thirty years.”

“On my way,” she said, already pulling on her sweats over her damp swimsuit. The clean feeling was already gone, replaced by a familiar knot of acid in her stomach. The city was waking up around her as she drove, a slow procession of headlights and the hiss of tires on damp asphalt. The Peace Tower stood stoic against the lightening sky, a postcard image of order and governance that felt like a bitter joke. Her world wasn't one of order. It was a constant, frantic effort to shove chaos back into its box, only for it to seep out through the cracks somewhere else.

The station was a hive of low-grade anxiety. The coffee was burnt, the air stale. Superintendent Davies was in his glass-walled office, looking older than he had the day before. He gestured her in, not even waiting for her to sit before he slid a thin file across his desk. It wasn’t a standard case file. It was a collection of printouts, pages and pages of text from a website. The header was simple, done in a cloyingly cheerful, curly font. ‘The Tickle Trunk’.

“Read it,” Davies commanded, his voice a low growl. He sank into his chair, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands. “Cyber Crimes flagged it a month ago. Flagged it and filed it. ‘No credible threat,’ they said. ‘Creative writing,’ they said. Then patrol gets a call two weeks ago. A mother in the Glebe. Her kid, seven years old, wakes up screaming about the ‘giggle monster’. Wouldn’t let anyone touch him for a week. The mother thought it was just nightmares until her friend sent her a link to this.”

Isabelle picked up the first page. The prose was… grotesque. It was written in a saccharine, almost childish voice, filled with sickeningly sweet adjectives and diminutives. It described finding children. In parks, in backyards, once even through an unlocked patio door. It described the process of startling them, of pinning their small bodies down, of the initial moment of surprise that would curdle into confusion, then fear. It described, in lavish, loving detail, the act of tickling them. It catalogued the sounds of their laughter, how it would change pitch as it became hysterical, then desperate. How their giggles would turn to gasps, then sobs. The author called herself Jenna. She wrote as if she were a benevolent spirit, bringing the gift of ‘unfettered joy’. But beneath the cloying sweetness, a different flavour bled through. A deep, abiding, and venomous hatred.

“She writes about it like a connoisseur,” Isabelle murmured, a cold dread coiling in her gut, colder than the lake had been. “She describes the way their breath hitches, the tears… this isn’t about joy.”

“No, it’s not,” Davies agreed, his voice flat. “It’s about power. It’s about violation. The tech boys say it’s all routed through a dozen proxies, bouncing from servers in Estonia to Brazil. They can’t get a lock on it. But this… this is new.” He tapped a freshly printed page at the bottom of the stack. It had been posted at three in the morning.

Isabelle read it. The tone was different. The sweetness was gone, replaced by a raw, seething anger.

*They don’t appreciate the gift,* it began. *The little vessels are ungrateful. Their laughter is a lie, a thin skin over the screaming panic they truly feel. They look at me with their wide, stupid eyes and they don’t understand the lesson. The lesson is that there is no safety. The lesson is that your parents cannot protect you. Your home is just a box of wood and drywall. Your bed is just a mattress. I can get to you anywhere. I can turn your own joy against you, make it a weapon that chokes you. You think this is the worst I can do? You think a little unwanted laughter is the end of it? Oh, you sweet, stupid, breakable little things. The tickling was just the introduction. The real lesson is about to begin.*

Isabelle put the page down, her hand trembling slightly. She pressed her fingers to the desk, steadying herself. The words felt like they had a physical weight, a poison seeping from the cheap printer ink. This was an escalation. A manifesto. The mask was off.

“There are no bodies, Izzy. No physical evidence besides a few scared kids and a bunch of pixels. The brass doesn’t want to cause a panic. They want this handled quietly,” Davies said, his gaze hard. “But I’ve got a feeling, the kind that keeps me up at night. This Jenna… she’s not going to stop at writing. She’s working herself up to something. This hatred… it needs a release. A big one.”

“She calls them ‘vessels’,” Isabelle said, her mind racing. The water. She could feel the ghost of it on her skin, a clean memory against this filth. “She’s dehumanizing them. That’s a classic step. First you make them objects, then you can do anything you want to them.”

“Exactly. I want you to run this. Not Cyber Crimes, not Major Case. You. I need your instincts on this, not just an algorithm. Find her. Find this woman, this… thing. I don’t care how. Read every word she’s ever written. Live inside her head until you know what she’s going to have for breakfast. Find the crack in her digital wall. Because I swear to God, Izzy, if we don’t, the next file I slide across this desk won’t be printouts. It’ll be autopsy reports.”

Isabelle Greenfield stood, the file clutched in her hand. The title, ‘The Tickle Trunk’, seemed to mock her from the top page. A trunk was a place you stored things. Memories. Treasures. Or, it was a place you hid things you wanted to forget. A place where things could be locked away in the dark, left to fester. Jenna wasn’t hiding. She was curating. She was building a museum of stolen innocence, and the final exhibit had yet to be unveiled. Isabelle’s swim felt like a lifetime ago. The honest fight of muscle against water was a simple, clean thing. This was different. This was a fight against a ghost, a phantom fuelled by pure malice, and Isabelle already felt like she was drowning.Her desk was an island in a sea of beige cubicles, a cluttered testament to a dozen other lives derailed. Piles of files, cold coffee cups, a framed photo of a smiling, dark-haired girl who was no longer a girl and no longer smiled at her that way. Her daughter, Chloe, taken at sixteen, three years ago. Another kind of loss. She dropped the ‘Tickle Trunk’ file onto the only clear space. It landed with a soft thud that sounded unnaturally loud in the hum of the station. For a moment, she just stared at the cheerful font, a perky, insidious weed sprouting from the dry soil of official paperwork. Davies was right. This was different. This wasn’t about greed or passion or revenge, the usual, ugly engines of human violence. This was something else. Something curdled.

A young constable, Ben Carter, hovered near her desk, his face a mixture of eagerness and apprehension. He was fresh out of training, with a haircut that was too sharp and a belief in the system that hadn’t yet been eroded by reality. He was assigned to her for the month, a rotation meant to give him a taste of homicide. Izzy suspected Davies had given him to her because his un-tempered optimism was the only thing in the building that might not be immediately extinguished by her moods.

“Ma’am? The Superintendent said you’d be taking lead on… a new file?” he asked, his eyes flicking to the printouts on her desk. He was smart enough not to read the header aloud. “Cyber Crimes already sent over their initial work-up. It’s… thin.”

“Thin doesn’t cover it, Carter. It’s a ghost. I want you to go back to them. Get every scrap of data they have, no matter how insignificant they think it is. I want server logs, IP histories, flagged keywords, geodata from any comments, even the ones she deleted. And I want you to print every single post from that website. Every comment. I want a paper copy of the entire goddamn thing. I want to be able to touch it,” she ordered, her voice flat. She needed to make this phantom tangible, to drag it out of the ether and pin it to a corkboard.

While Carter scrambled to comply, Izzy opened the case file on her terminal and began to read. She forced herself to go slow, to absorb the cadence of the writing, the specific, poisoned vocabulary ‘Jenna’ used. The posts were arranged chronologically, a diary of escalating violation. She wrote about ‘sleepy lions’ in their dens and ‘little birds’ in their nests. She described, with unnerving accuracy, the layout of the houses she entered. A blue nightlight in the shape of a crescent moon. The squeak of the third step on a staircase. The faint scent of lavender from a child’s shampoo. These weren’t just stories; they were reconnaissance reports disguised as twisted fairy tales. Each entry was a meticulous record of a successful intrusion, a victory in her undeclared war on innocence. She was showing off, boasting of her ability to breach the most sacred of spaces without leaving a trace.

The deeper she read, the more the cloying sweetness of the prose felt like a physical assault. It was the saccharine smell of a room where something had died. The words crawled under her skin. *“Little Lucas made the most wonderful noise, like a bag of startled kittens,”* one post read. *“His small hands fluttered like moths against my own, so weak, so wonderfully helpless.”* Izzy felt a surge of nausea. She pushed back from her desk, the recycled air in the station suddenly thick and unbreathable. She walked to the washroom and splashed cold water on her face, staring at her own reflection in the cracked mirror. The woman looking back had dark circles under her eyes, her jaw tight. She saw the ghost of the swimmer from the lake, but she was already fading, submerged beneath the weight of this new filth. She was drowning again, and this time, there was no surface to break.

By mid-morning, Carter returned, his arms laden with stacks of paper that he deposited on the desk with a heavy thud. “This is all of it, ma’am. Over a hundred separate posts, dating back eighteen months. The comments section is a cesspool. A lot of encouragement. A few people calling her out, but they usually get shouted down or their comments are deleted.”

“Good. Grab a cart. We’re moving.” Isabelle scooped up the files and led the way to a small, windowless interview room at the back of the hall. The room was sterile, furnished with nothing but a metal table and three chairs. “This is our new home. I want you to start taping these to the walls. In chronological order. I want to see the timeline. I want to see the evolution.” As Carter began the grim task of turning the sterile room into a gallery of horrors, Isabelle grabbed her jacket. “I’m going to the Glebe. I’m going to talk to the mother of the ‘giggle monster’.” She needed to see the first ripple this monster had made in the real world. She needed to look into the eyes of someone whose child had met Jenna and come back.The Glebe was a neighbourhood of quiet money and deep-rooted trees. Stately brick homes stood back from the road, their manicured lawns still damp with morning dew. It was the kind of place where people believed in the integrity of their deadbolts and the vigilance of their neighbours. A place where monsters were confined to storybooks. As Isabelle drove her unmarked sedan down the leafy streets, she felt a cold fury building. Jenna hadn't just broken into a house; she had punctured a carefully constructed reality, proving that the walls were an illusion. Every laughing child in a passing stroller, every brightly coloured play structure in a backyard, now looked like a target.

The house was a handsome two-story red brick, with a wide front porch where a small blue bicycle lay on its side. A woman with tired, haunted eyes opened the door before Isabelle could ring the bell. She was holding a mug of coffee like a shield. Her name was Sarah Gable. She had the frayed look of a parent who hadn't slept properly in two weeks, her nerves stretched as taut as piano wire. She led Isabelle into a kitchen that was achingly normal—children’s drawings taped to the fridge, a high chair in the corner, a faint smell of toast and dread.

“The first officer… he was very polite,” Sarah began, not meeting Isabelle’s eyes as she poured her a coffee she hadn’t asked for. “He took my statement. He suggested Leo might have had a vivid nightmare. He was very gentle when he told me there was nothing they could do.” The bitterness in her voice was sharp. She had been managed, placated, and sent on her way.

“This isn't a nightmare, Sarah. I know that,” Isabelle said, her tone leaving no room for argument. She didn't touch the coffee. Instead, she slid a single page from the file across the polished wood of the kitchen table. It was the post about the ‘giggle monster’, the one that had led Sarah’s friend to send her the link. She watched the mother’s face crumble as she read the saccharine, triumphant prose describing her own son’s terror. “She calls herself Jenna. We believe she’s the one who was in your son’s room.”

Sarah’s composure broke. A dry, hitching sob escaped her. “He… he called it that. The giggle monster. He said it held him down and it wouldn’t stop, and he was laughing so hard he couldn’t breathe. He thought he was going to die.” She looked up at Isabelle, her eyes pleading. “Who does that? Who does that to a child?”

That was the question, the one that hummed at the base of Isabelle’s skull. She let Sarah compose herself, then began to ask the questions the first officer hadn’t. “Tell me about that night, Sarah. Anything. A sound. A smell. Something that felt out of place before you heard him scream.”

Sarah closed her eyes, forcing herself back. “I was dozing. I thought I heard a floorboard creak in the hall, but we have an old house, and a cat… I didn't think anything of it. Then the scream.” She shuddered, a full-body tremor. “When I ran in, the room was cold. The window was open a crack, which was strange because it was a cool night. And there was a smell.” She frowned, trying to place it. “It was… sweet, but not like perfume. It was spicy. Like… cloves. Or Christmas baking. It was gone in a second, but it was there.”

Cloves. A specific, sensory detail. It was the first solid thing Isabelle had to hold onto, a single piece of grit in the smooth, digital façade. “And Leo? What did he say she looked like?”

“He didn’t see a face,” Sarah whispered, her voice barely audible. “He said she had cold hands and she was humming. A nursery rhyme. He couldn’t remember which one, he was too scared. He just remembers the humming and the smell of cloves. And the laughing. He said… he said she was laughing with him, but it was a wrong kind of laughing.”

Isabelle felt the chill of the lake water return, a phantom cold on her skin. A humming, clove-scented woman with cold hands who broke into houses to terrorize children, then chronicled it for an online audience of sympathizers. She wasn’t just a ghost in the machine. She was real. She had a scent. She had a voice. She had hands.

“Where is Leo now?” Isabelle asked softly.

“At my mother’s,” Sarah replied, her voice thick with a fresh wave of grief. “He won’t sleep here. He won’t sleep in his own bed. We tried. He woke up screaming that the monster was coming back. Last week, I made him his favourite funny-face pancakes, and he just stared at them. He told me he didn’t want to laugh anymore, because she might hear him and come back.”

The words landed like punches. *I can turn your own joy against you.* Jenna hadn’t just stolen a child’s sense of safety; she had stolen his laughter. She had turned the most natural expression of childhood delight into a trigger for terror. It was a kind of psychological vandalism so profound, so targeted, that Isabelle felt a purely personal, unprofessional hatred for the woman who wielded it. Davies was right. This wasn't going to stop. This was practice.

Leaving the house, Isabelle gave Sarah her personal cell number, a gesture that seemed to give the distraught mother the first sliver of hope she’d had in weeks. The quiet, tree-lined street now looked menacing. Every shadow seemed deeper, every open window an invitation. The case was no longer a stack of paper or a series of grotesque posts. It was the haunted look in Sarah Gable’s eyes. It was a seven-year-old boy who was afraid of pancakes. It was the faint, phantom scent of cloves in a child’s bedroom. It was real, and it was a promise of something worse to come. Driving back to the station, Isabelle didn’t see the postcard image of the Peace Tower. She saw a gallery of horrors taped to a wall, and she knew she had to tear it down, piece by poisonous piece, before the final exhibit was unveiled.The interview room smelled of whiteboard markers and Carter’s nervous energy. He had done as instructed. The walls were papered over with Jenna’s poison, a chronological testament to her reign of micro-terror. Standing in the centre of the room felt like standing inside a diseased mind. The cheerful font of the website header, repeated on every page, was a relentless, mocking chirp in the face of the vile text below it. Carter stood by the wall, a roll of tape in his hand, looking like a museum curator arranging an exhibit he desperately wished would burn.

Isabelle walked to a small, clear space on the wall between two of the printouts. She uncapped a red marker and wrote in sharp, angry capitals: CLOVES. Underneath it, she added: HUMMING. NURSERY RHYME. They were the first tangible things in a case made of electrons and malice. The first pieces of the real world to intrude on Jenna’s carefully curated fantasy.

“She was there,” Isabelle said, her voice low and tight. She didn’t need to look at Carter to know she had his full attention. “She smelled of cloves, and she hummed. The mother from the Glebe, she smelled it. The boy, he heard it.” She capped the marker with a vicious snap. “This thing has a body, Carter. It walks and it breathes and it leaves a scent.”

“Okay,” Carter said, his young face pale but set with determination. “Okay. A scent. A sound. That’s something.” He looked at the vast sea of text on the walls. “But how do we get from a smell to a name?”

“We stop looking at this like a website. We start looking at it like a series of crime scenes,” Isabelle commanded, her eyes scanning the neat rows of paper. “Jenna isn’t just writing stories. She’s bragging. She’s leaving trophies. Look at the details she includes.” She tapped a page from six months prior. *“The little princess’s room was a study in pink, with a white canopy bed that looked like a spun-sugar cage. The second floorboard from the door whines like a stepped-on puppy, but I know how to shift my weight to keep it quiet.”* Isabelle stared at the words, a new thought solidifying. “She knows the layouts. Too well. The squeaky floorboard, the nightlight, the view from the window. She’s not just peeking through a window. She’s either doing extensive, high-risk surveillance on each house, or…”

Her voice trailed off as the idea fully formed, cold and ugly and perfectly logical. In this day and age, you didn’t have to risk standing in the bushes. The world invited you in through the front door, digitally.

“Carter, get on your terminal. Now,” she ordered, a new urgency in her voice. “I want you to take the addresses from the patrol reports we have. The Glebe house, and any others flagged as a possible link. I want you to search for them on every real estate site you can find. Zillow, Redfin, local MLS listings. Look for anything recent. Sales, rentals, anything in the last two years. I want to see photos. I want to see virtual tours.”

Carter’s fingers flew across the keyboard, the clatter of the keys a frantic counterpoint to the room’s oppressive silence. Isabelle paced the small space, her gaze sweeping over the walls, her mind connecting new dots. The boastfulness. The unnerving accuracy. The sheer volume of her intrusions. It would be nearly impossible to gather that level of detail for so many different locations without being spotted. But if the information was just there, publicly available, packaged and presented for anyone to see…

“Got one,” Carter said, his voice tense. “The Gable house. It was sold eighteen months ago. The listing is still up on a realtor’s legacy site. It includes a full photo gallery and… oh, Jesus.” He turned his monitor towards her. “There’s a 3D walkthrough tour.”

Isabelle leaned over his shoulder. He clicked the link, and a digital rendering of the Gable house bloomed on the screen. They could navigate it with the mouse, moving from room to room, looking up at the ceilings, down at the floors. They moved the view up the stairs. Carter clicked forward, a disembodied glide down the hallway. He paused outside the door to what was now Leo’s bedroom. On the screen, it was staged as a generic guest room, but the layout was identical. The window was in the same place. The door’s position relative to the hallway was the same.

Isabelle’s eyes narrowed. “Go to the listing description. Read the agent’s notes.”

Carter scrolled down. He read aloud, his voice flat with dawning comprehension. “‘This charming, classic Glebe home has been lovingly maintained, retaining its original character. Note the unique crescent-moon nightlight in the upstairs bedroom, a vintage touch. Buyers should be aware the third step on the main staircase has a slight, characteristic creak.’” His voice dropped to a near-whisper. “Ma’am… it’s all here. The nightlight, the squeaky step. She didn’t discover it. She read it in the ad.”

The room felt suddenly colder. The phantom was taking shape. Jenna wasn’t just a predator; she was an architect of fear who used the mundane tools of modern life as her blueprints. She was a scavenger, picking through the digital detritus people left behind and weaponizing it. She found the vulnerabilities people unknowingly advertised to the world and used them to prove that no lock, no alarm, no safe neighbourhood could ever be enough.

“She’s a researcher,” Isabelle breathed, the realization settling like a stone in her gut. The case had just cracked wide open. It was no longer about a ghost who could walk through walls. It was about a woman who sat at a computer, just like them, and shopped for victims. “Check the other addresses. All of them. Find the links. Social media, too. I want to know if these parents are posting photos of their kids’ rooms, talking about their new houses. Find her data stream, Carter. Find out how she’s watching.”

The hunt had changed. They were no longer chasing a monster through the dark. They were following a trail of breadcrumbs through the vast, glaring light of the internet, and for the first time, Isabelle felt the thrill of the chase. The clean pain. The honest fight. The ghost had a method, and a method could be undone. She stared at the wall of text, at Jenna’s saccharine, monstrous words, and for the first time, she smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. It was the smile of a hunter who has just picked up the scent of her prey.The predatory grin remained fixed on Isabelle’s face as the small, windowless room transformed around her. It was no longer a tomb for forgotten files but a command centre, a war room. The air, once stagnant with the smell of old paper and anxiety, now crackled with the electric hum of discovery. Carter, sensing the shift, shed his earlier trepidation and became a seamless extension of the machine in front of him, his fingers a blur as he dove into the digital guts of the city. He was no longer a nervous constable; he was a bloodhound, and Isabelle had just given him the scent.

“Cross-reference everything,” she commanded, her voice a low, sharp instrument. “Every complaint of a suspected intruder in the last two years, even the ones dismissed as kids’ nightmares. Match them against real estate sales, rental listings, social media posts. I want to know every time a proud new homeowner posted a picture of their front door key with the address tag still on it. I want to know every time a parent geotagged a photo of their child’s birthday party in their own backyard. Find her shopping list.”

The pattern emerged faster than either of them could have anticipated, a horrifying mosaic of digital naivety and predatory calculation. A house in Barrhaven, subject of a ‘prowler’ call three months ago; the owners had posted a comprehensive video tour on their YouTube channel, boasting about their smart-home security system. A duplex in Hintonburg where a child woke up screaming about a ‘shadow with cold fingers’; the rental listing included detailed floor plans and noted the faulty lock on the back-porch screen door. Again and again, they found the source material for Jenna’s invasions, freely offered up to the world. She wasn’t a phantom who could walk through walls; she was just a diligent student of other people’s carelessness.

Isabelle leaned back against the wall, the paper crinkling behind her. The sheer banality of Jenna’s method filled her with a new kind of contempt. This wasn’t the brilliant, high-risk work of a master criminal. It was parasitic. Jenna was a bottom-feeder, sifting through the digital exhaust of ordinary lives, finding the cracks not in their walls, but in their desire to be seen. The desire to share, to celebrate, to announce to the world, *Look at my beautiful home. Look at my perfect life. Look at my happy child.* Jenna had found a way to turn that impulse into an indictment. The hatred in her writing suddenly made more sense to Isabelle. It was the furious, venomous envy of the excluded. She wasn’t just violating these homes; she was mocking the dream they represented.

They worked through the afternoon and into the evening, fueled by burnt coffee and the grim momentum of their progress. Carter compiled a spreadsheet, a damning list of victims linked by a common thread of digital overexposure. They were building a profile, not from psychological theory, but from data. Jenna targeted new families, often in their first home. She chose homes with publicly available layouts. She focused on neighbourhoods celebrated for their safety, amplifying the impact of her violation. The cloves, the humming—those were her signatures, the flourishes of an artist signing her work. But the true artistry was in the preparation, in the cold, patient hours she must spend at a screen, scrolling, watching, choosing.

Just as Carter was tracing the digital footprint of a real estate photographer who had shot three of the properties, an alert pinged on his screen. It was a simple, automated notification he had set up an hour before. A new post had just appeared on ‘The Tickle Trunk.’ Isabelle was at his shoulder in an instant. The title of the post was not whimsical or cloying. It was five simple words that made the blood in Isabelle’s veins turn to ice.

*I See You Watching Me.*

The tone was stripped of all artifice. The saccharine persona of ‘Jenna’ was gone, as was the raw rage of her last manifesto. This was something new. Colder. More direct. It was the voice of a player acknowledging her opponent.

*You found my library, didn’t you? You’re very clever. Sifting through my reading list, thinking you understand the story. You’re looking at the squeaky floors and the faulty locks, and you think you’ve found a weakness. My weakness. But you’re wrong. That wasn’t a weakness. That was a courtesy. I was showing you how easily your little boxes can be opened. I was giving you a chance to learn.*

Isabelle’s hand tightened on the back of Carter’s chair. The post was a direct taunt. Jenna was not only aware of their investigation, she was monitoring it in real time, turning their own progress into another move in her game. She was re-contextualizing her past actions, not as crimes, but as lessons they had failed to heed. The arrogance was breathtaking.

*You think you are the hunters, but you are just more children in a house you think is safe. You have your own walls of procedure and protocol. You think they will protect you from me. They won’t. Now the introductions are over. The research is done. The time for gentle lessons has passed. The little vessels were ungrateful, and so are you. So the real lesson will be for everyone. I’m going to take a child, and this time, the tickling won’t stop. This time, the laughter will run out of breath. Permanently. You want to know when? I’ll even give you a clue. The lesson begins when the first lamp is lit against the dark.*

Carter looked up at Isabelle, his face ashen. “The first lamp is lit against the dark… Ma’am, what does that mean?”

Isabelle’s mind raced. It was a riddle. A poetic, monstrous riddle. Her eyes darted around the room, from the printouts to the words she’d scrawled on the wall. The city of Ottawa. A city of governance and symbols. And then she knew. “Winterlude,” she whispered, the name of the city’s winter festival feeling like a curse on her tongue. “The festival starts with the official lighting ceremony. They call it the Illumination Ceremony. ‘Lighting the lamps against the winter dark.’”

“But that’s months away,” Carter said, a sliver of relief in his voice.

“No,” Isabelle countered, her heart hammering against her ribs as she pointed to a calendar tacked to a nearby corkboard. “Not Winterlude. Look. This weekend. It’s the kick-off for the fall tourist season. They’re doing a special event. A one-night-only ‘Illumination of the Fall.’ They’re lighting up the trees around the canal for the first time.” Her gaze met Carter’s, her expression grim. “The first lamp is lit on Friday. At sunset. We have less than seventy-two hours.” The game had a deadline. And for the first time, Jenna had promised a body.The phrase “less than seventy-two hours” fell into the windowless room and absorbed all the oxygen. The earlier thrill of discovery curdled into the metallic taste of panic. Carter stared at his screen, his face bleached of all colour, as if the post had leeched the life right out of him. The walls, papered with Jenna’s vile prose, no longer looked like evidence; they looked like a countdown timer, each post a tick of a clock that was about to strike midnight. For a long moment, the only sound was the frantic hum of Carter’s computer fan, a noise that suddenly seemed to be mocking their powerlessness. Isabelle was the first to move, the first to break the paralysis. The swimmer in her knew that to stop moving in a cold sea was to die.

She grabbed the fresh printout of Jenna’s threat, her knuckles white. “Davies. Now.” She swept out of the room, Carter scrambling in her wake, his youthful optimism replaced by the wide-eyed shock of a soldier seeing the front line for the first time. They stormed through the hushed bullpen, a two-person whirlwind of impending doom. Isabelle didn’t knock on the Superintendent's door; she slammed it open, the glass wall rattling in its frame. Davies looked up, his face a mask of exhaustion from a day that was already too long. He saw the look in Isabelle’s eyes and was on his feet before she could speak.

“She knows we’re on to her,” Isabelle said, her voice devoid of all inflection. She slapped the printout onto his desk. “She’s taunting us. And she’s given us a deadline.” She spelled it out, the words precise and cold as autopsy tools. “The Illumination of the Fall ceremony. Friday at sunset. She’s going to kill a child. She’s announced it on her blog. Your quiet case is about to go very, very loud.”

Davies read the post, his face seeming to age a year for every sentence. The weariness in his eyes burned away, replaced by a glacial fury. He picked up his phone, his thumb jabbing at the screen. “Get me the Deputy Chief,” he barked into the receiver, his voice a low growl that promised retribution. “I don’t care what time it is. I don’t care if he’s in bed with the Mayor. Wake him up. And clear the main briefing room. Call in every detective from Major Case, Cyber Crimes, and Robbery. Off-duty, on-duty, I don’t give a damn. Get them here. Full task force. Now.” He slammed the phone down and looked at Isabelle, his gaze hard as granite. “This is your show, Izzy. You’re running it. I’ll keep the brass off your back. You just find this bitch. Whatever it takes. No more rules. Burn the whole city to the ground if you have to.”

The station, which had been winding down into the low hum of the night shift, erupted. The summons went out, and the quiet hive of low-grade anxiety transformed into a fortress preparing for siege. Phones rang incessantly. Detectives, bleary-eyed and smelling of sleep, began to filter in, their faces grim as they were briefed. Isabelle stood before them in the main briefing room, a place usually reserved for press conferences and formal commendations. Now, it was a war room. With Carter at her side, projecting the ‘Tickle Trunk’ website onto the large screen behind them, she laid out the timeline of terror, the discovery of Jenna’s method, and the final, horrifying threat. The cheerful, curly font of the blog’s header loomed over the room like a sick joke.

"She’s a researcher," Isabelle told the assembled detectives, her voice cutting through the murmurs of disbelief and horror. "She sits behind a screen and uses our own lives against us. Real estate listings, social media, public records. She finds the cracks we advertise to the world and she slips through them. She hides in plain sight, in a sea of data. Our job is to drain that sea." Assignments were given out with rapid-fire efficiency. Teams were dispatched to coordinate with the festival organizers, to canvass the neighbourhoods of previous victims, to re-interview every family. She put Cyber Crimes on a singular, desperate task: to find a mistake in Jenna’s last post. “She was emotional. She was bragging,” Isabelle insisted to the unit’s skeptical team lead. “Pride comes before the fall. Find the crack in her digital wall.”

As the task force dispersed, leaving Isabelle and Carter in the now-cluttered briefing room, she allowed herself a moment to process the magnitude of what she had unleashed. The investigation had a hundred new arms and legs, but it still had only one brain. Her brain. She walked to the whiteboard and uncapped the red marker again. CLOVES. HUMMING. She stared at the words. "These are personal touches," she said, more to herself than to Carter. "The digital research is cold, efficient. This is different. This is her ritual. The scent, the sound… they’re part of her signature. Why cloves? It’s domestic. Nostalgic. It’s the smell of home, of safety. She's poisoning the very idea of it." She was building a profile not of a monster, but of a woman. A woman consumed by a hatred so profound it had to be meticulously, artistically applied.

Hours bled into one another. The station buzzed with the frantic energy of a race against time. Sometime after 3 a.m., Isabelle found herself back at her own desk, the epicentre of the storm. The framed photo of Chloe caught her eye. It was from a school trip, years ago. Chloe was laughing, her head thrown back, her smile wide and unburdened by the years of silence and resentment that would follow. It was the sound of pure, unfettered joy. The very thing Jenna had declared war on. A hot, clarifying rage surged through Isabelle, burning away her exhaustion. This wasn't just a case. It wasn't just a threat to the city. It was a personal affront to every parent who had ever delighted in their child's laughter. It was a desecration.

“Ma’am.” Carter’s voice, strained with fatigue but sharp with adrenaline, cut through her reverie. He stood over a terminal they had set up in the briefing room, a massive screen displaying a complex web of interconnected data points. “I think I have something.” Isabelle was by his side in a second. "I've been going through the corporate registries, cross-referencing them with the properties," Carter explained, his fingers moving deftly. "It's not the real estate agencies. The staff turnover is too high, and the overlap is minimal. But the houses have something else in common. Four of the seven we've confirmed as targets were staged for sale by the same company."

He brought up a website on the main screen. The logo was elegant, a stylized drawing of a warm, inviting fireplace. The name was printed beneath it in a soft, welcoming font: ‘Hearth & Home Staging’. The company’s slogan appeared in a scrolling banner: *We don’t just sell houses. We sell the dream of home.* Isabelle’s eyes narrowed. The dream. The perfect life. The very thing Jenna’s victims represented.

"Keep going," Isabelle urged, a cold certainty beginning to form in her gut.

Carter clicked through the company’s online portfolio, a gallery of beautifully sterile, impossibly perfect rooms. Then he navigated to their services page. "They offer a 'Signature Scent' package for their premium stagings. To create a memorable, welcoming atmosphere for open houses." He highlighted the description with his cursor and read it aloud. "Our exclusive, custom-blended potpourri infuses the home with the warm and inviting aroma of cinnamon, orange peel, and clove."

The final word landed in the silent room with the force of a physical blow. Clove. It wasn’t just a personal quirk. It was a tool of her trade. Jenna wasn't just bringing the scent with her; the scent was already there, waiting for her. A calling card she had placed herself, long before she ever returned in the dark. The phantom of the internet suddenly had a professional life. She had a job. And a list of clients. The hunt was no longer for a ghost in the machine. It was for a woman who sold the dream of home by day, and turned it into a nightmare by night. Isabelle looked at the company’s logo, the inviting hearth, and saw only the entrance to a predator’s den.The name of the company, ‘Hearth & Home Staging,’ hung on the large screen, its gentle font a grotesque mockery of the horror it represented. For a full ten seconds, the war room was utterly still, the dozens of exhausted detectives frozen in a collective moment of stunned silence. The clove connection wasn’t just a lead; it was a key turning in a lock they hadn’t even known existed. The entire case, once a shapeless fog of digital malice, had just snapped into sharp, terrifying focus. Isabelle felt a cold, clean wave of certainty wash over her, the same feeling she got in the deep water of the lake when she found her rhythm and knew she could swim forever. This was it. The ghost was about to get a name.

Superintendent Davies was the first to find his voice, a low rumble that cut through the silence. "Get me everything on this company. I want a warrant for their business records, their client lists, their employee files. I want to know who owns it, who works there, who cleaned their goddamn floors last Tuesday.” His voice was a coiled spring of controlled violence. He wanted to kick in the door and drag the monster out into the light. But Isabelle held up a hand, a quiet gesture that nonetheless stopped him cold.

"No, sir. Not yet," she said, her voice steady and calm, a stark contrast to the frantic energy that had just ignited the room. "She's watching us. Her last post proves it. If we come at her with warrants and uniforms, she’ll know we've found her. She’ll burn her digital life, she’ll disappear, and she will accelerate her timeline. She won't give us the satisfaction of stopping her; she'll snatch a child and vanish just to prove she can." Isabelle turned to face the room, her gaze sweeping over the assembled officers. "She thinks this is a game. She’s laid a trap for a child, but she’s also laid one for us. A clumsy move now, and we spring it."

Davies’ jaw was a knot of muscle. He hated it, every cop instinct in him screamed for a direct assault, but he saw the unshakeable logic in her eyes. This wasn't a crack den to be raided; it was a spider's web, and the spider was still at its center, watching, waiting. "So what's your play, Izzy? We have less than two days to sunset on Friday."

"We play her game," Isabelle replied, her eyes fixed on the company's slogan on the screen. *We sell the dream of home.* "She hides in the open, among the props of a life she covets. So we go there. Carter, get me the employee list for 'Hearth & Home'. I want names, photos, and addresses. Now." While Carter’s fingers resumed their frantic dance on the keyboard, Isabelle turned to two of her most trusted senior detectives. "Duvall, Macleod. You're going to be our happy couple. You're new to Ottawa, flush with cash from a tech buyout, and you're looking for your dream home in the Glebe. Your realtor is setting up a consultation with the best home stager in the city tomorrow morning. I want you inside that office. I want you to meet the staff. I want you to breathe the air. And I want everything recorded."

Within minutes, Carter had the data. Hearth & Home Staging was a small, boutique operation. It had a staff of four: two part-time movers, an office assistant, and the owner and lead stylist. Her name was Jennifer Holloway. The photograph on her professional registration was of a woman in her late forties with a strained, professionally pleasant smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Her hair was perfectly coiffed, her makeup immaculate. She looked like the embodiment of her company's brand: polished, tasteful, and completely aspirational. She looked like a thousand other successful small business owners in the city. But as Isabelle stared at the photo, she felt a familiar, cold dread coil in her stomach.

“Jenna,” Isabelle murmured, the persona clicking into place beside the real name. Jennifer. Jenna. It was the kind of arrogant, flimsy disguise a narcissist would choose. She wasn’t hiding; she was playing dress-up. “Carter, dig into her. I want to know where she lives. I want to know if she's married, if she has kids. I want to know what her own dream home looks like.” The answer came back in under ten minutes and was more damning than any piece of evidence they had found so far. Jennifer Holloway was unmarried. No children. She didn’t live in a stately home in the Glebe or a chic downtown condo. She lived in a small, third-floor walk-up apartment in a nondescript building in Vanier, one of the city's grittier, less affluent neighbourhoods. There was no real estate listing for her apartment, no 3D tour, but Google Street View told its own story. It was a life of anonymity, a world away from the luxurious, happy homes she meticulously curated for her wealthy clients.

Isabelle could see it then, a portrait of a life curdled by resentment. Every day, Jennifer Holloway would step into the lives of the happy and successful, touching their fine linens, arranging their family photos, making their homes look like a magazine spread. She was the architect of a dream she could never inhabit. Every throw pillow she plumped, every warm and inviting scent she deployed, was a reminder of her own exclusion. The hatred in Jenna’s writing was the scream of Jennifer Holloway’s silent, bitter life. She wasn't just terrorizing children; she was desecrating the altars of the domestic bliss she so desperately craved and so furiously despised. The tickling wasn’t about joy or power; it was a punishment. A punishment for the crime of having a life she was denied.

"That's our woman," Isabelle said, her voice dropping to a near whisper. The room was silent, every detective staring at the smiling face of Jennifer Holloway, the face of the ‘giggle monster’. "She spends her days building their nests, learning their floor plans, breathing in the scent of their happiness. And then she comes back in the night to poison it." Isabelle's gaze shifted to the clock on the wall. Time was hemorrhaging. The trap for Detectives Duvall and Macleod was set for the morning, but it felt like a lifetime away. They had found their phantom, but the final act of her monstrous opera was already scripted, and the curtain was set to rise on Friday at sunset.The dawn was a dirty grey smear over the city, the kind of light that promised a long, grim day. It found Isabelle not in the cleansing waters of the lake, but in the cramped, metallic confines of a surveillance van. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the low, anxious hum of electronics. Outside, across the street, was the tastefully sandblasted brick facade of Hearth & Home Staging. It looked less like a business and more like a fortress of good taste. Isabelle watched it on a small, grainy monitor, a hunter watching a den, knowing the predator was waking inside.

Her two detectives, Duvall and Macleod, sat in the back of the van, their faces pale in the glow of their phones as they did a final review of their cover identities. Duvall, a burly, bearded man who usually worked armed robberies, was now a soft-handed tech millionaire named "Mark." Macleod, sharp and wiry with a mind for details, was his art-consultant wife, "Elise." They looked uncomfortable in their expensive, tailored clothes, like children playing dress-up. Isabelle adjusted the volume on her headset, the link to the wire Macleod was wearing.

"Remember," Isabelle said, her voice a low murmur that filled the van, "you're not cops. You're everything she despises and everything she wants to be. You're happy. You're successful. You have a future she can only stage for other people. She'll be looking for cracks in your performance, but what she really wants is to be admired. Flatter her work. Praise her taste. Make her feel like the genius she believes she is. Let her talk. We need her to talk." She looked at them, her eyes hard. "And whatever you do, do not react to the smell."

At precisely 9 a.m., they exited the van, transforming as they hit the pavement. The tension in their shoulders eased, replaced by the casual, entitled slouch of the wealthy. They laughed at some private joke as they crossed the street, a perfect portrait of oblivious happiness. Isabelle watched them on the monitor, her hand hovering over the audio controls, her stomach a tight knot of acid. She was sending her people into the web, and she was utterly powerless to help them if the spider decided to bite.

The moment the feed from Macleod's wire crackled to life, the first thing they heard was a chime, followed by a woman's voice. "Mark, Elise? Welcome. I'm Jennifer Holloway. It's such a pleasure to meet you." Her voice was exactly as Isabelle had imagined: smooth, cultured, and perfectly modulated. It was a voice designed to soothe and reassure, the vocal equivalent of a cashmere throw blanket. Then, Isabelle heard Duvall's faint, practiced inhale. The scent had hit him.

"The place smells incredible," Macleod said, her voice a perfect blend of surprise and admiration. Isabelle’s jaw tightened. Good. Feed the beast.

"It's our signature blend," Jennifer's voice purred. "A little welcome to the dream. Please, come in. Can I get you a water? A tea?"

The feed relayed the sounds of them moving through the space. The office was an open-concept showroom, a symphony of greys, creams, and tastefully distressed wood. Every object was perfectly placed, every surface gleaming. It was sterile, beautiful, and utterly devoid of life. It was a stage set, waiting for actors. Jennifer led them to a seating area around a low, marble coffee table. Isabelle watched on a pinhole camera feed from a broach on Macleod’s jacket. She saw Jennifer Holloway in motion for the first time. She moved with a quiet, efficient grace, her smile never faltering. But her eyes, as she looked at the "couple," were constantly scanning, assessing. It was the look of a predator sizing up its prey.

"So," Jennifer began, settling into a chair opposite them, "you're looking for a home in the Glebe. A wonderful choice. It's all about creating a feeling of history, of family, of safety." The last word hung in the air, a poisoned dart. Isabelle felt a cold prickle on her skin. She was using their own language, the language of the victims, as a sales pitch.

The conversation flowed, a masterful performance on all sides. Duvall and Macleod played their parts perfectly, talking about their desire for a home to raise the family they hadn't yet started. Jennifer responded with practiced empathy, all the while steering them through her portfolio on a large tablet, showcasing her transformations of empty houses into idealized homes. "You see, it's not about furniture," she explained, swiping through images of sun-drenched kitchens and cozy nurseries. "It's about creating a narrative. We craft a story of happiness. When a potential buyer walks in, they need to feel that story, to see their own perfect life reflected in the space we've created. We make it unforgettable."

Isabelle felt sick. Every word was a confession, a piece of her manifesto sanitized for a client meeting. *The little vessels… the lesson is that your parents cannot protect you.* Jennifer wasn’t just staging houses; she was building her hunting grounds. As Jennifer spoke, Macleod let her gaze wander as if admiring the office. Her eyes, and the camera, swept over Jennifer's immaculate desk. It was almost bare: a sleek laptop, a pen, and a single, heavy stock folder. On the tab of the folder, a handwritten name was visible for a fraction of a second before Jennifer shifted, blocking the view. But the camera had caught it. *Tremblay.*

Back in the van, Carter was already typing, his face illuminated by the screen's glow. "Macleod saw a folder on the desk," Isabelle said into her own mic, her voice barely a whisper. "The name is Tremblay. See if Hearth & Home has a current client by that name."

In the office, the conversation was winding down. As they stood to leave, Duvall, as instructed, made the final play. "Your work is just incredible, Jennifer. This Illumination festival on Friday… we were thinking of going. I bet every house along the canal wishes you'd staged it for the big night." It was a clumsy line, but it was designed to provoke, to see if she would take the bait.

Jennifer’s professional smile tightened for just a second, a barely perceptible flicker. "It is a special night for the city," she said, her voice a little too bright. "A time for new beginnings. I do have one project right on the canal that will be… showcased, you could say. The family is very excited for their first festival in their new home." She was boasting. Just like on the blog. She couldn't help herself. She had to show off her work.

"Got it," Carter hissed from his terminal. "The Tremblay family. A doctor and a lawyer. Moved in two months ago. Address is 142 Queen Elizabeth Driveway. Right on the Rideau Canal. They have two children. A boy, nine, and a girl, six." He spun his monitor around. The real estate listing was still online, complete with a virtual tour shot by Hearth & Home Staging. It was a stunning, modern home with a wall of glass windows facing the canal path, where thousands of people would gather for the Illumination ceremony. It was a fishbowl. A stage.

As Duvall and Macleod walked out of the building, resuming their roles as a happy, carefree couple, Isabelle stared at the images of the Tremblay house. She saw the little girl’s bedroom, decorated in soft blues and whites. She saw the back garden, with its pristine lawn and direct access to the public canal path. And she saw Jennifer Holloway’s words from her final post blazing in her mind: *The real lesson will be for everyone.* She wasn't going to break into a house in the dead of night. She was going to do it in plain sight. With the whole city watching. They had the who, and now they had the where. But the 'how' was a terrifying blank, and the clock was ticking louder than ever.The Tremblay house was a monument to modern architectural ambition, a stack of glass and steel cubes perched on the edge of the Rideau Canal. It didn’t blend into the historic neighbourhood; it defied it, a bold declaration of newness and wealth. From the surveillance van parked a block away, Isabelle watched it through a pair of high-powered binoculars. It was less a home and more an exhibit, designed to be looked at. Jennifer Holloway hadn't just chosen a target; she had chosen a stage, and the house itself was her star performer. The information from Duvall and Macleod’s undercover visit had spread through the task force like wildfire, transforming the investigation’s frantic energy into a sharp, focused beam. They had the who and the where. But the how remained a terrifying ghost in the machine.

“She called it a ‘showcase’,” Isabelle said, lowering the binoculars. Her eyes ached from lack of sleep. “The Tremblay house is going to be her masterpiece. This isn’t going to be a quiet snatch-and-grab. This is theatre. She wants an audience.” She turned to Carter, who was hunched over a laptop, his face bathed in the blue light of a dozen open windows. “What have you got on the house systems?” The young constable was no longer just an aide; he was the engine of her investigation, his digital fluency her most potent weapon.

“It’s a fortress, ma’am. Fully integrated Crestron smart-home system. Controls everything: lights, locks, climate, security cameras, even the blinds. All controllable from a central panel or a phone app,” Carter reported, his voice tight with a mixture of admiration and dread. “The owner, Dr. Tremblay, is a bit of a tech enthusiast. The security installer’s notes say he wanted top-of-the-line, ‘unbreachable’ protection.” The word ‘unbreachable’ sounded like a fool’s prayer in the context of their current enemy. Jennifer Holloway specialized in finding the cracks in things people believed were solid.

“She was in that house for weeks during the staging,” Isabelle thought aloud, her mind racing through the possibilities. “She had access to everything. She could have cloned a key fob, installed a hidden device, gotten the Wi-Fi password… What if the ‘showcase’ isn’t just the location? What if she plans to make the house perform for her?” The idea was chilling. A house that was supposed to be a sanctuary, its own systems turned against its inhabitants. It was exactly Jennifer’s brand of psychological warfare. There was only one way to find out. “We’re going in. I’m going to talk to them.”

Superintendent Davies’s voice crackled over the radio, a protest born of decades of procedural caution. “Izzy, you can’t just knock on the door and tell them a monster is coming to steal their child. They’ll panic. They’ll run. Holloway will see that, and she’ll disappear. Or worse, she’ll pick a new target, and we’ll be back to square one with the clock at zero.”

“She won’t pick a new target,” Isabelle countered, her voice flinty. “This is personal for her. The Tremblay house, on the canal, during the festival—it’s the culmination of her work. She’s too much of a narcissist to give up on her grand finale. As for the family, I’m not sending a uniform. I’m going myself.” She trusted her instincts. She trusted her ability to read people, to manage fear. It was the same skill she used in interrogation rooms, but this time, she would be using it to build a fortress, not tear one down.

Isabelle Greenfield and Ben Carter walked up the slate pathway to the glass front door of 142 Queen Elizabeth Driveway. They didn’t look like cops. Isabelle was in a simple black pantsuit, Carter in a blazer and chinos. They looked like what they were about to pretend to be: city officials, there to do a final security consultation for the festival. The canal path behind them was already dotted with workers in high-visibility vests, stringing lights in the trees and setting up barricades. The city was dressing up for a party, oblivious to the fact it was being held on the edge of a precipice.

The woman who opened the door was Dr. Alistair Tremblay’s wife, a corporate lawyer named Genevieve. She was tall, poised, and radiated an air of brisk, no-nonsense intelligence. She listened with a faintly impatient air as Isabelle gave her the cover story about potential security risks due to the large crowds expected for the Illumination ceremony. “We’ve been assured by the festival organizers that there will be ample security,” Genevieve said, her arms crossed. She was a woman used to being in control, and she clearly viewed this as an unnecessary bureaucratic intrusion.

“Of course,” Isabelle said, her voice calm and even. “But our department likes to be proactive. With your home’s unique visibility, we just want to ensure your systems are perfectly secure and that you and your family can enjoy the evening without a single worry.” She held the woman’s gaze. It was a delicate dance. She needed to get inside, but she couldn’t push too hard. “It would only take a few minutes. My colleague can just run a quick diagnostic on your network interface. We won’t even have to come past the foyer.” This last part was a lie, but it was a necessary one.

Genevieve hesitated, then gave a tight, conceding nod. “Fine. Ten minutes.” She led them into a soaring, white-walled foyer that looked like an art gallery. It was beautiful, impressive, and as cold as a morgue. While Carter, with a nod from Isabelle, knelt by a wall panel and began his work, Isabelle stayed with Genevieve. “You have a beautiful home, Mrs. Tremblay. The staging company did a remarkable job. Hearth & Home, wasn’t it?”

“Yes. Jennifer Holloway,” Genevieve confirmed. “She’s a miracle worker. A bit… intense, but she has an incredible eye. She said our home would be the talk of the canal on Friday.” The pride in her voice was unmistakable. Jennifer had sold her the dream, and she had bought it completely. The intensity, Isabelle knew, was the barely-contained rage of the predator.

“Ma’am?” Carter’s voice was sharp. He stood up, a strange look on his face. “Mrs. Tremblay, where is the hub for your home network?”

“It’s in the main-floor utility closet,” she answered, a flicker of annoyance crossing her face. “Why?”

“The diagnostics are showing a rogue device connected to your network. It’s piggybacking on your Wi-Fi, but it’s masked. I can’t tell what it is from here, but it’s drawing a low, constant stream of power and data. It’s a ghost in your system,” Carter said, letting the carefully chosen words hang in the air. The colour drained from Genevieve Tremblay’s face. The idea of a breach, a secret intrusion into her perfectly controlled world, had done what Isabelle’s gentle persuasion could not. The fortress wall had just been compromised from within.

“Show me,” Genevieve demanded, her voice a clipped whisper. She led them through a starkly minimalist living room to a small, unassuming door. Inside the utility closet was a gleaming white rack of servers and wires, the blinking heart of the smart house. Carter’s eyes scanned the setup, his gaze methodical. And then he saw it. Tucked behind the main router, almost invisible against a tangle of black cables, was a small, grey box the size of a deck of cards. It had no branding, no labels, just a single, tiny, blue blinking light. It hadn’t been installed by the security company.

Isabelle looked from the box to Genevieve’s horrified face. The time for games was over. “Mrs. Tremblay,” she said, her voice dropping, losing all its manufactured pleasantness and taking on the quiet, grave authority of a homicide detective. “That device wasn’t installed by my department. We’re not from the city. We’re with the Ottawa Police Service. And that box is why we are here. Your family is in terrible danger.”The silence in the utility closet was absolute. The only sound was the faint electronic hum from the server rack, a sound that had once represented security and was now the pulse of a hostile parasite. Genevieve Tremblay stared at the small grey box, her formidable composure shattering like a dropped pane of glass. The professional mask of the high-powered lawyer fell away, revealing the terrified mother beneath. Her hand flew to her mouth, her eyes wide with a dawning, visceral horror.

“What is that?” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Who… who are you?”

Isabelle met her gaze, her own expression unyielding. There was no pity in it, only a grim, shared understanding of the precipice on which they now stood. “My name is Detective Inspector Isabelle Greenfield. And that,” she said, nodding towards the device, “is a remote access Trojan. A hardware backdoor into your entire life. It gives someone else control of your security, your cameras, your locks. Everything. It was placed here by the woman who staged your home. Her name is Jennifer Holloway.”

The name landed like a physical blow. Genevieve flinched, shaking her head in frantic denial. “Jennifer? No. That’s impossible. She’s… she’s a professional. A little odd, maybe, but…” Her voice trailed off as a montage of memories likely flashed through her mind: the woman’s ‘intense’ focus, her unnerving compliments, her intimate knowledge of the house before it was even theirs. The denial crumbled, replaced by a surge of pure, unadulterated fear.

“Carter, bag it,” Isabelle ordered, her eyes never leaving Genevieve’s. “I want to know everything it can do. Yesterday.” While Carter carefully detached the device with a pair of insulated tweezers and sealed it in an evidence bag, Isabelle gently guided the stunned homeowner out of the closet and into the vast, empty living room. The wall of glass overlooking the canal suddenly felt less like a window and more like the lens of a microscope. They were specimens in a jar.

“Mrs. Tremblay, I need you to listen to me very carefully,” Isabelle began, her tone low and urgent. “We don't have a lot of time. For the past eighteen months, Jennifer Holloway, under the name ‘Jenna,’ has been running a website. A blog. On it, she details breaking into homes and terrorizing children. She calls it ‘bringing the gift of unfettered joy.’ She tickles them until their laughter turns to sobs, until they can’t breathe. She writes about it in loving, grotesque detail. She did it to a seven-year-old boy in the Glebe two weeks ago. He hasn’t slept in his own bed since.” Isabelle paused, letting the brutal reality sink in. “She has escalated. She posted a public threat two nights ago. She announced she’s going to kill a child during the Illumination ceremony on Friday. She called it ‘the real lesson.’ Your home, Mrs. Tremblay, is her classroom. And she has chosen one of your children to be the lesson.”

Genevieve sank onto one of her stark white sofas as if her legs had dissolved. She wrapped her arms around herself, a futile gesture against a chill that was coming from inside. This was a nightmare made real, a monster from a forgotten fairy tale now wearing a familiar face and standing in her home. “My children,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Oh God. Alistair. I have to call my husband. We have to leave. We have to get them out of here.” She fumbled for her phone, her fingers shaking too violently to unlock the screen.

“No,” Isabelle said, her voice sharp but not unkind. “That’s the one thing you cannot do.” The word hung between them, a command so counter-intuitive it bordered on cruelty. “Jennifer is watching. I don’t know how, but I know she is. If you pack a bag, if you suddenly pull your kids from school, she will know we’re on to her. She will vanish. And we will lose her. The threat doesn’t disappear, Mrs. Tremblay. It just moves to another house, another child we don’t know about. Right now, this house, your family… you are the only thing standing between her and her next victim. We know the time and we know the place. That is the only advantage we have, and I will not give it up.”

The sheer, impossible weight of the request settled on Genevieve. She looked at Isabelle with eyes full of a lawyer’s outrage and a mother’s terror. “You’re asking me to use my children as bait.” The accusation was stark, ugly, and entirely true.

“I’m asking you to help me catch a killer,” Isabelle countered, her voice softening slightly. “And I swear to you on my life, I will not let her get to them. My team is already moving into place. We will be in this house. In the houses next door. We will have snipers on the rooftops across the canal. We will have officers disguised as festival-goers in the crowd. From this moment until we have her in custody, your children will be the most protected people in this city. She will think she is walking into her masterpiece, but she will be walking into our trap. But it only works if she believes the stage is set exactly as she designed it. It only works if you and your family play your parts.”

Just then, the front door opened, and a man in tailored scrubs walked in, his brow furrowed in confusion at the scene in his living room. Dr. Alistair Tremblay. His eyes darted from his ashen-faced wife to the two strangers standing in their home. The story, brutal and surreal, had to be told all over again. Alistair’s reaction was different from his wife’s. Where she had been analytical, then terrified, he was a raw nerve of paternal fury. He wanted to fight, to act, to physically stand between the monster and his children. The idea of passive participation was anathema to him.

“Absolutely not,” he seethed, after Isabelle had finished. “I am taking my wife and my children and we are leaving this city until you find that psychopath. That is not a request.”

“Dr. Tremblay,” Isabelle said, holding his furious gaze. “Your wife has already seen the device Jennifer planted in your wall. This isn't theoretical. Your home is already compromised. Jennifer Holloway doesn’t just have a key; she has the entire system wired. Carter,” she called out. The constable, who had been waiting silently by the door, stepped forward. “Tell them what you found.”

Carter held up the bagged device. “It’s a network bridge with a built-in cellular modem. She’s not piggybacking on your Wi-Fi, she’s created her own private, invisible network inside your house. From this, she can access and control any smart device connected to your hub. She can lock and unlock your doors, turn your lights on and off, and—most importantly—she can view a live feed from any of your security cameras. She can also disable them, or replace the live feed with a looped recording. When she looks at her phone, she can see inside your house as if she’s sitting right here. She can see us right now if she's watching. But she also thinks we're city officials. If Dr. and Mrs. Tremblay suddenly disappear from the camera feeds, she will know the game is up."

The technical explanation did more to sway the doctor than any of Isabelle’s pleas. The image of this woman, this stranger, watching his family through the very cameras he’d installed to protect them, was a violation so profound it left him speechless. The fight drained out of him, replaced by a cold, dreadful understanding. They were already in the trap. The only question was whether they would help spring it.

Genevieve looked at her husband, her expression hardening with a new resolve. She was no longer just a terrified mother; she was a lawyer again, assessing risk, calculating odds. “If we run, she hurts someone else,” she said, her voice low but firm. “If we stay, you can stop her. For good.” It wasn't a question. It was a statement of fact.

Isabelle nodded slowly. “For good.”

Alistair Tremblay looked at his wife, then at Isabelle. He took a deep, shuddering breath, the breath of a man accepting an unbearable burden. “What do we have to do?” he asked, his voice rough with emotion.

The city continued its preparations for the festival outside. The sounds of cheerful work, of a city dressing up for a party, filtered through the triple-paned glass. But inside house number 142, the stage was being set for a very different kind of performance. The family, the house, the police—all were now actors in a grim play, their lines written, their places marked. All they could do was wait for the lead actress to make her entrance.The twenty-four hours that followed were a masterclass in controlled chaos, a silent, methodical invasion that happened in plain sight. The Tremblay’s pristine home, a monument to minimalist design, was transformed into a complex and deadly trap. Under the guise of a pest control company’s fumigation tent—a sudden and non-negotiable emergency—teams of plainclothes officers and technicians swarmed the property. They moved with a hushed efficiency, their gear packed not in tactical bags but in coolers and duffel bags, like neighbours helping with a move. They mapped every inch of the house, installing pinhole cameras that were indistinguishable from screw heads, pressure pads under rugs, and audio sensors in the ventilation system. The house was no longer just a stage; it was a fully wired instrument, and Isabelle was its conductor.

Isabelle’s most difficult task was not coordinating the tactical setup, but managing the human element at its heart. She sat with Genevieve and Alistair in their starkly beautiful kitchen, the morning light streaming through the glass walls, illuminating the terror in their eyes. The children, Liam and Sophie, were at school, granting them a few hours of reprieve, a small bubble of normalcy before they had to begin the performance of their lives. “You cannot watch them every second,” Isabelle instructed, her voice low but firm. “You cannot hold their hands too tight. You must be the parents you were yesterday. You must laugh at their jokes. You must get mildly annoyed when they spill their juice. Jennifer is not just watching for our presence; she is watching for yours. She’s looking for the scent of fear, and she knows it better than anyone.” She watched them absorb the impossible directive, two intelligent, successful people now tasked with the most difficult acting role imaginable: pretending that their world was not about to end.

In the basement, amidst a rack of wine bottles that cost more than his car, Ben Carter had established his digital command post. He had become Isabelle’s shadow, his youthful eagerness burned away by the gravity of their task and replaced by a cold, focused intensity. He had successfully isolated Jennifer’s trojan device within a digital sandbox, a virtual cage that allowed him to monitor her every query without her detecting his presence. He could see every packet of data she pulled, every camera feed she accessed. He was in a silent duel with a ghost, fighting for control of the house’s electronic soul. “She’s logged in three times this morning,” Carter reported to Isabelle via their secure comms. “Just looking. She watched Mrs. Tremblay make coffee for ten minutes. She checked the feed from the camera in the upstairs hallway. She’s just… admiring her handiwork. Making sure the stage is set.”

As the day wore on, the festive energy from outside became a constant, mocking counterpoint to the coiled tension within. The cheerful sounds of sound checks, the laughter of families gathering on the canal path, the enticing smell of food trucks setting up shop—it all filtered through the triple-paned glass like broadcasts from another, happier planet. Inside, every officer was in place. Two were hidden in the attic, enduring the stuffy heat. Another was in the guest room closet, cramped between winter coats. The real Genevieve and Alistair Tremblay were downstairs, their movements tracked by a hundred hidden eyes, while a team in the garage monitored the live feeds, ready to move in seconds. The city was putting on its party dress, completely unaware that the season’s premier horror film was about to debut in its most exclusive theatre.

The test came at 4:17 p.m. Liam and Sophie were home from school, having a snack at the massive kitchen island. Sophie, the six-year-old, laughed, a high, tinkling sound that made every cop in the house flinch. At that exact moment, the sleek, automated blinds on the main glass wall slid silently down, plunging the room into shadow. Sophie gasped in surprise. Alistair froze, his hand halfway to his coffee cup. Genevieve’s breath hitched. A dozen safeties were clicked off in the hidden corners of the house. Isabelle’s voice came instantly over their hidden earpieces, calm and cold as lake water. “Hold. Everyone hold. Do not react.” A beat of absolute silence, then, “Alistair. Act annoyed. Blame the system.” Alistair, his face a mask of rage and terror, forced a shaky laugh. “This damn house,” he muttered, walking to the control panel. “Always has a mind of its own.” He tapped the screen, and the blinds slid back up, flooding the room with late afternoon sun. He had passed the test. On Carter’s screen in the basement, the command log was clear: a single, anonymous packet of data had been sent and received. Jennifer was checking her strings, making sure her puppet would dance.

The final hour before sunset was the worst. The Tremblays went through the motions of dinner, moving plates and forks with exaggerated slowness, the food tasteless in their mouths. The children were vibrating with excitement, begging to go outside to see the lights. “Not tonight, sweetie,” Genevieve said, her voice impossibly steady. “We have the best view in the whole city right from our living room.” It was a promise that sounded like a death sentence. Isabelle moved through the house like a ghost, her presence a silent reassurance to her hidden teams. She took her final position in the master bedroom on the second floor, a room with a commanding view of the back garden, the canal path, and the crowds below. Her headset crackled with the quiet, final check-ins. “Rooftop one is set.” “Canal team has eyes on all access points.” “Carter, status?” The reply came from the basement, his voice tight. “She’s active. She’s watching the camera feed from the back garden. Just watching. Waiting.”

Isabelle raised her binoculars, focusing on the sea of expectant faces packed along the water’s edge. They were here for a spectacle, a moment of manufactured beauty. They had no idea they were the audience for something else entirely. The sky bled from orange to deep purple. A hush fell over the crowd. A dignitary’s voice mumbled indistinctly from a distant speaker. Then, a single, clear note from a trumpet cut through the air. On the far side of the canal, the first lamp, a brilliant globe of gold, flickered to life.As the trumpet note faded, the chain reaction began. One by one, the lamps encircling Dow’s Lake and lining the Rideau Canal ignited, a string of golden pearls cast against the deepening velvet of the evening. A collective gasp rose from the crowd, followed by a wave of applause that washed against the glass walls of the Tremblay house. Inside, Liam and Sophie were pressed against the window, their small hands leaving prints on the pristine surface, their faces alight with a genuine, uncomplicated joy that felt like a razor against Isabelle’s nerves. For a single, deceptive moment, it was just a family watching a festival. A perfect picture. A beautifully staged scene.

Then, the performance began. It started not with a bang, but with a sound that was infinitely more terrifying. From the home’s integrated ceiling speakers, a tinny, plinking melody began to play. It was a nursery rhyme. A simple, childish tune that Isabelle recognized instantly from Sarah Gable’s tearful description. It was the giggle monster’s theme song. Genevieve and Alistair froze, their faces turning to monuments of dread. On her earpiece, Isabelle heard a dozen officers report their readiness, their voices tight with adrenaline. “Hold,” she commanded, her own voice a low, steady anchor in the rising sea of panic. “Stay on my command.”

As the nursery rhyme looped, a mocking, endless carousel of sound, the lights inside the house began to flicker, not randomly, but in a rhythmic, playful pulse, like a slow, deliberate wink. The smart house was dancing to Jennifer’s tune. The effect was immediate and disorienting. Alistair instinctively moved toward the control panel, Genevieve toward her children. Their focus was drawn inward, into the chaos Jennifer was orchestrating within the walls. It was a classic magician’s misdirection. And Isabelle, watching from the upstairs window, knew instantly that the real trick was happening somewhere else.

Her gaze snapped to the back garden, her binoculars scanning the manicured lawn, the sculpted hedges, the tall privacy fence. Everything was still. The crowd on the canal path was a wall of mesmerized faces, all turned toward the lights on the water. No one was looking at the house. And then she saw it. The small, wrought-iron gate at the far end of the garden, the one leading directly to the public path, was ajar. It swung gently in the breeze, an open invitation. In the basement, Carter’s voice came over the comm, strained and breathless. “She sent a single command packet a minute ago. `unlock(gate_B)`. I didn’t know what it was. I thought it was an internal door.”

At that same moment, a pattern of soft, coloured lights illuminated the slate pathway leading from the patio to the open gate. They blinked on and off in sequence, a playful, beckoning trail. A breadcrumb path for a lost child. Downstairs, Sophie, distracted from the main lights by the chaos inside, turned. She saw the open gate. She saw the pretty, blinking lights on the ground. To a six-year-old, it wasn’t a threat. It was a game. With the fluid speed of a small child making a break for it, she slipped away from her mother’s side, pushed open the sliding glass door that had been left slightly ajar, and ran out onto the lawn, her small feet following the glowing path.

“Target is mobile! Sophie is in the garden!” The call came from the officer in the living room, but Isabelle was already moving. “All teams hold! Do not engage! She wants us to move on the house! It’s a feint!” She tore her headset off, dropping it on the bed. The time for conducting was over. This was a fight that required her hands. As she sprinted down the hallway, she saw what the cameras couldn’t. A figure detaching itself from the edge of the crowd. A figure in a bright yellow high-visibility vest, a festival volunteer, anonymous and invisible. The figure moved to intercept Sophie at the open gate, kneeling down, arms open not in violence, but in welcome. It was Jennifer.

Isabelle hit the stairs at a dead run, her body moving with the familiar, coiled power of her morning swims. The honest fight. It was the only one she knew. She burst through the patio doors, her feet pounding on the soft grass, the sound swallowed by the cheering crowd. She saw Jennifer scoop Sophie into her arms. The child didn’t scream. She laughed. “The giggle monster found you!” Jennifer’s voice was sickeningly sweet, a singsong chant meant to sound like a game. Her fingers were already at Sophie’s ribs, digging in, her expression one of rapturous, hateful concentration. Sophie’s laughter was bright, then it hitched, the pitch rising into the first notes of hysteria. *The laughter will run out of breath.*

Isabelle didn’t shout. She didn’t warn. She closed the final twenty feet in a silent, vengeful sprint and launched herself forward. She hit Jennifer Holloway with the full force of her body, a driving, shoulder-first tackle that was pure, unthinking instinct. The impact was brutal. Jennifer, Sophie, and Isabelle all went down in a tangle of limbs, hitting the manicured lawn with a sickening thud. Sophie, shocked and breathless, rolled free, letting out a terrified wail. Jennifer, her face contorted in a mask of pure fury at the interruption of her masterpiece, lashed out, her fingernails clawing for Isabelle’s eyes.

This was not a clean fight. It was a raw, desperate scramble in the dirt. Jennifer was surprisingly strong, fueled by a lifetime of curdled rage. She fought like a cornered animal, kicking and spitting, her professional veneer stripped away to reveal the feral thing beneath. But Isabelle was a swimmer. She knew how to use leverage, how to endure pain, how to push through resistance until it broke. She deflected a flailing punch, twisted her body, and pinned Jennifer’s shoulders to the ground with her full weight. For a moment, they were frozen, chest to chest, their faces inches apart. Isabelle stared down into the eyes of the monster. They were not the eyes of a calculating genius or a supernatural phantom. They were the pathetic, furious eyes of a deeply, irrevocably empty woman.

“It’s over, Jenna,” Isabelle gasped, her voice raw. The name was a deliberate cruelty, a final stripping away of her disguise. Jennifer bucked beneath her, a final, futile surge of defiance, and then went limp. Around them, the trap had finally sprung. The silent, hidden officers swarmed from the house and the surrounding darkness, their weapons drawn, their voices sharp and professional. The sounds of the festival, the music and the cheers, were finally pierced by the shrill sound of police whistles and shouts. The crowd, turning from the lights on the water, finally saw the real show. On the lawn of the glass house, a woman in a high-visibility vest was being handcuffed, a small child was being swept into the arms of her sobbing father, and a detective inspector was pushing herself to her feet, her knuckles bleeding, her body aching with a clean, honest pain. The ghost was caught. The exhibit was closed.The aftermath was a cacophony of light and noise. The warm, festive glow of the canal lamps was corrupted by the frantic, pulsing blue and red of police cruisers. News vans, vultures drawn to the scent of crisis, added their own harsh white floodlights to the scene, bleaching the colour from the grass, the house, the faces of the officers securing the perimeter. Isabelle watched from the edge of the lawn as a paramedic gently checked over Sophie, who was wrapped in a blanket and her mother’s fierce embrace. Alistair stood beside them, his hand resting on Genevieve’s shoulder, his face a mask of shock, fury, and a gratitude so profound it was painful to witness. They were a family fractured and then fused back together by terror, a living testament to a horror that had come within a single breath of being absolute. On the grass, the discarded yellow high-visibility vest lay like the shed skin of a venomous snake, a mundane object now imbued with an aura of profound evil.

A sharp, radiating pain bloomed in Isabelle’s ribs. She pressed a hand to her side, the ache a grounding, physical fact in the surreal swirl of the evening. Her knuckles were raw and bloody, and her whole body felt like a single, bruised muscle. It was an ugly, messy pain, but it was honest. It was the price of dragging a phantom into the material world and proving it was made of flesh and bone and hate. She saw Ben Carter emerge from the house, his face pale in the flashing lights, his eyes wide with a mixture of professional triumph and human horror. He had spent the last day duelling a monster through a keyboard, and now he was seeing the real-world wreckage. He caught her eye and gave a single, jerky nod. A silent acknowledgment passed between them, the shared, unspoken knowledge of a job done, a line held.

Isabelle overrode the protests of a junior officer and insisted on riding in the back of the cruiser transporting Jennifer. They sat in a thick, vibrating silence, the sounds of the city muted through the heavy glass. The woman beside her was no longer Jennifer Holloway, the poised architect of dreams, nor was she Jenna, the malevolent spirit of the internet. She was a small, diminished creature, her expensive clothes torn and smeared with dirt, her perfectly coiffed hair matted with grass. A thin scratch wept a line of blood down her cheek. She didn’t rage or weep or plead. She stared out the window at the passing city lights, her expression utterly blank. It was not the vacant stare of shock, Isabelle realized, but the inert blankness of a screen that has been abruptly powered down, the elaborate program of her persona crashed beyond recovery.

Walking into the station felt like stepping onto a stage after a long and brutal performance. As she moved through the bullpen, a ripple of movement became a wave. Detectives, constables, and civilian staff stopped what they were doing and turned. Then, someone started to clap. The sound was hesitant at first, then grew, filling the cavernous room. It was a raw, spontaneous tribute from people who understood the cost. Isabelle, bruised, dishevelled, and emotionally flayed, merely dipped her head in acknowledgment, her face too grim for a smile. This was not a game, and there were no winners. Superintendent Davies was waiting for her by his office, the deep lines of exhaustion on his face softened by a relief so profound it seemed to take years off him. He didn’t offer congratulations or platitudes. He simply put a heavy hand on her shoulder, his grip firm and grounding. “Go finish it, Izzy,” he said, his voice thick with unspoken meaning.

The interrogation room was a sterile cube of grey and white, stripped of all personality. No files, no photos on the wall, no distractions. Just a metal table and three chairs. Isabelle entered first and sat, her back straight, her hands resting calmly on the table. She waited. When two uniformed officers brought Jennifer in, she seemed to shrink even further under the harsh, humming fluorescent lights. They sat her opposite Isabelle, her hands cuffed in front of her. She resumed her new state of utter stillness, her gaze fixed on a scuff mark on the table’s surface. The silence stretched, a tactic Isabelle had perfected over two decades. Let the quiet do the work. Let the suspect’s own mind become the inquisitor. This was Jennifer’s last stage, and Isabelle was her only audience.

After a full minute, Isabelle finally spoke. Her voice was quiet, calm, almost conversational. “It was the details,” she said, as if picking up a chat they’d had earlier. “The squeaky floorboard in the Glebe house. The crescent-moon nightlight. The way you knew to shift your weight to keep it quiet. That wasn’t just good research. It was… artistry. No one appreciated the level of detail you brought to it. The precision. They just saw the chaos you left behind, not the work that went into creating it.”

For the first time since her capture, Jennifer moved. Her head lifted a fraction of an inch. Her eyes, still dull, flickered with the barest spark of indignant pride. Isabelle saw it, the first crack in the facade, and pressed on. “The clove scent. Using your own staging signature as a calling card. That was brilliant. Turning the very thing meant to welcome people into their dream home into a marker of terror. It’s poetic, really. But they wouldn’t get that, would they? The police, the parents… they’re too stupid. They don’t appreciate the narrative.”

The blank mask shattered. A sneer, ugly and visceral, twisted Jennifer’s lips. “They are stupid,” she whispered, her voice a dry, unused rasp. “They’re animals. They live in these beautiful boxes, these… these perfect dreams I build for them, and they don’t even see it. They just fill them with their noise and their mess and their… their sticky, ungrateful children.” The venom was back, pure and undiluted. The dam of her silence had broken.

The words began to pour out of her, a torrent of righteous self-pity and curdled rage. It was not a confession of crimes, but a justification of a worldview, a manifesto delivered to an audience of one. She spoke of the mothers who complained about her invoices while wearing thousand-dollar shoes, the fathers who looked right through her as if she were just another piece of tasteful, inanimate furniture. She spat out her contempt for the children, the ‘little vessels,’ who ran through her perfect, sterile stagings with muddy feet and careless hands, who laughed and screamed with an effortless, unearned joy she found obscene. “They had everything,” she hissed, her cuffed hands clenching into white-knuckled fists on the table. “And they deserved none of it. I wasn't hurting them. I was teaching them. I was teaching them that their little boxes are made of paper. That their joy is a weapon that can be turned on them. That safety is just a story you tell yourself at night. The tickling… that was the lesson. The laughter turning to fear… that was the truth.”

Isabelle listened without flinching, her face an impassive mask. She let Jennifer exhaust her fury, letting all the poison drain out of her until there was nothing left but a bitter, weeping woman in a cold room, complaining about how no one in the world had ever truly appreciated her. When she was finally done, when the torrent had slowed to a trickle of dry, hiccupping sobs, Isabelle stood. She didn’t say another word. She didn’t need to. She turned and walked out of the room, leaving Jennifer Holloway alone with the ugly, pathetic echoes of her own hatred.

Outside, Davies was waiting. “You get it?” he asked. Isabelle nodded, a deep weariness settling into her bones. “Every pathetic word.” She walked past him, down the hall and through the bullpen, the adrenaline finally deserting her. She didn't stop until she was outside in the cool, clean night air. The city lights seemed different now, less a celebration and more a fragile constellation of a million small boxes, all full of a messy, noisy, precious life she had just fought to protect. She pulled her phone from her pocket, not to call her daughter, but to check the weather forecast for the morning. Clear skies. Good swimming weather. She needed the water. She needed the deep, indifferent chill of the lake to wash this all away.The water was the same black silk, and the cold was the same deep, indifferent chill of an Ottawa autumn. But Isabelle Greenfield was not the same swimmer who had cut through it just days ago. She sliced through the pre-dawn gloom of Dow’s Lake, her arms carving the same rhythmic, powerful arcs, but the mantra of the motion had changed. Stroke, breathe, stroke, breathe. It was no longer a cleansing ritual, but a desperate attempt to outrun the echoes in her head. Instead of the anonymous faces of decay, she saw Sophie Tremblay’s wide, terrified eyes. She felt the ghost of Jennifer Holloway’s wiry strength struggling beneath her, the spittle of rage on her cheek. The fight in the water had always been an honest one, muscle against elemental resistance. The fight on the Tremblay’s lawn had been something else entirely. It was ugly, personal, and it had left a residue that the cold, clean water could not seem to touch.

She pushed harder, faster, chasing the lung-burning ache that was the only sensation strong enough to mute the others. For days, she had lived inside a predator's mind, tracing the contours of a curdled, obsessive hatred. Now that the predator was caged, its thoughts still clung to her like silt. *They’re animals. They don’t appreciate the dream.* The pathetic, self-pitying justification she’d heard in the interrogation room was a more insidious poison than the saccharine prose of the blog had ever been. It was the banality of the evil, the sheer, mundane smallness of the woman behind the monster, that felt impossible to wash away. When she finally hauled herself from the water, her body steaming in the cool air, she did not feel the usual clean pain of exertion. She just felt tired, a deep, cellular exhaustion that the ache in her shoulders could not mask. The city was waking up, but for the first time in a long time, she felt no urgency to meet it.

Her apartment was an oasis of quiet order, a stark contrast to the chaos of her job and the churning of her own mind. She showered, letting the hot water sluice over her bruised ribs and scraped knuckles, but the feeling of being unclean remained. She made coffee, the rich aroma a welcome change from the station’s burnt sludge, and turned on the morning news. It was the lead story. A slickly produced graphic with a curling, playful font filled the screen: ‘The Tickle Trunk Terror’. A news anchor with a professionally solemn face was narrating the events of the previous night, her voice lending a dramatic, cinematic quality to the raw horror Isabelle had lived through. They called Jennifer ‘The Giggle Monster,’ a piece of branding that turned a complex, pathetic woman into a cartoon villain. They showed footage of the Tremblay house, of officers leading a handcuffed Jennifer to a cruiser, of the crowd’s shocked, illuminated faces. They had turned the whole sordid, tragic affair into entertainment. Isabelle watched, a cold, impotent anger rising in her. They were taking the ugliest night of the Tremblay family’s life and packaging it for public consumption. They were doing exactly what Jennifer had done: turning someone else’s pain into a story for their own benefit. She clicked the television off, the sudden silence of the apartment feeling more honest than the noise.

Her gaze fell on the framed photo on her mantelpiece, the one she so often avoided. Chloe, at sixteen, laughing, her head thrown back in a moment of pure, unburdened joy. Before the silence. Before the slammed doors and the accusations. Before Isabelle’s job had become a wall between them, a grim shadow that Chloe could no longer stand to live under. For the first time in years, Isabelle didn't just see the loss. She saw the laughter itself, the precious, fragile thing she had just fought to protect for someone else's child. She thought of Sophie Tremblay, whose laughter had been turned into a weapon against her, and a wave of something sharp and painful, something that felt like regret, washed over her. She pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over Chloe’s name in her contacts. What could she even say? The gulf between them felt miles wide, carved out by years of unspoken resentments. Her fingers, stiff and clumsy, typed out a message, deleted it, then typed again. *I know it's been a while. Just wanted to say I'm thinking of you.* It was simple. Pitiful, even. But it was the truest thing she could think to say. She pressed send before she could lose her nerve, the small whoosh of the message disappearing into the ether feeling as momentous as firing a weapon.

The station was an anticlimax. The frantic energy of the task force had dissipated, leaving behind a mountain range of paperwork and the stale smell of victory. The main briefing room, once a war room, was being put back in order. The grim gallery of Jennifer’s posts had been taken down from the walls, leaving behind a faint grid of tape marks, like surgical scars. Ben Carter was at his desk, his face buried in a stack of supplementary reports. He looked up as Isabelle approached, and she saw that the bright-eyed eagerness he’d had a week ago was gone, replaced by the tired, knowing gaze of a man who had seen the bottom of the well. The new-car smell was gone for good. “Morning, ma’am,” he said, his voice flat with fatigue. “Forensics sent over the final report on the trojan. It was even worse than we thought. She had kill switches for their CO detectors and could have manipulated the furnace temperature from her phone. She wasn’t just going to snatch the kid. She was going to burn the whole house down around them if she had to.” The casual horror of it hung in the air between them. “You did good work, Carter,” Isabelle said, the compliment feeling wholly inadequate. “We did, ma’am,” he replied, and in that small correction, she heard the shared weight of what they had accomplished.

She spent the next few hours dictating her own reports, the dry, procedural language a shield against the chaotic reality of the events. It was a process of turning blood and fear into neat, official lines of text, the final act of shoving chaos back into its box. Her phone, which she’d placed face down on her desk, remained silent. She told herself she didn’t care, that she hadn’t expected a reply. But a small, foolish part of her kept listening for the telltale vibration. It was nearly noon when it finally came, a single, sharp buzz against the wood of her desk. She picked it up, her heart giving a strange, unfamiliar lurch. It was a message from Chloe. Her fingers were trembling slightly as she opened it, bracing for silence, for anger, for a single, dismissive word. The message was four words long, but it felt like a novel. *I saw the news. Are you okay?* It wasn’t forgiveness. It wasn’t an olive branch. But it was not a slammed door. For the first time since she’d crawled out of the cold, dark water that morning, Isabelle Greenfield felt a flicker of something that was not dread, not exhaustion, and not the grim satisfaction of a job done. It was something fragile and tentative and warm, and it felt, in its own way, like a new kind of dawn.The four words on Isabelle’s phone screen were a heavier weight than the entirety of the case file she had just closed. *I saw the news. Are you okay?* The question was simple, direct, and stripped of the cold formality that had defined their sparse communications for the past three years. It was a question that demanded more than a one-word answer, and the terrifying truth was that Isabelle no longer knew how to speak to her own daughter in a language that wasn’t clipped, professional, or defensive. She, who could orchestrate a hundred-officer tactical operation and dismantle a psychopath’s psyche in a sterile room, was completely disarmed by a simple query from the one person she had failed most profoundly to protect. She felt an impulse to reply with a curt, ‘I’m fine,’ the same shield she used with everyone, but the memory of Sophie Tremblay’s high, terrified laughter stopped her cold. That was the old language, the language that had built the wall between them.

With fingers that felt thick and clumsy, she typed out a message, deleted it, and started again. She settled on honesty, or at least a version of it she could bear. *I’m okay. A few bruises, but they’ll heal. Glad it’s over.* It was safe. It was factual. But it wasn’t enough. Before she could talk herself out of it, she added another line, a fragile bridge thrown across a vast canyon. *It would be good to talk sometime. When you’re free. No pressure.* She hit send, the small electronic confirmation feeling as loud as a gunshot in the quiet hum of her office. She had ceded control, leaving the next move entirely up to her daughter. The vulnerability of it was a more profound fear than facing down Jennifer Holloway had ever been.

The buzz of her desk intercom was a welcome, if jarring, intrusion. “Superintendent Davies wants to see you, Inspector.” The voice of the desk sergeant was laced with a reverence that had not been there a week ago. As Isabelle walked towards the glass-walled office, the usual morning bustle of the station seemed to part for her. She received quiet nods, murmurs of “Good work, Inspector,” and the occasional thumbs-up from officers she barely knew. She was a hero, a label that felt like an ill-fitting suit made of scratchy wool. They saw the clean victory, the monster caged, the child saved. They hadn’t been on the lawn, they hadn’t felt the desperate, ugly scrape of the fight, and they hadn’t sat in the interrogation room listening to the pathetic, venomous whining of a failed human being. They hadn’t seen the real mess.

Davies was standing by his window, looking out over the city. He turned as she entered, and the fatigue in his face was matched by an undisguised pride. He gestured to the chair, but didn’t sit himself. “The brass are ecstatic,” he began, his voice dry. “The Mayor called personally. You’re getting a commendation for valour. Probably a medal from the Governor General. They’re calling it a textbook operation.” He let out a short, humourless laugh. “I told them the textbook for this one involved you going off-book and tackling a suspect in a garden.” He finally met her eyes, his own gaze searching. “That was a hell of a thing you did, Izzy. You saved that girl’s life.”

“Jennifer was going to use the child as a shield or a hostage. A direct assault by the team would have been a bloodbath. It wasn't a choice,” Isabelle stated, her voice flat, reciting the justification she’d already logged in her official report. It was the truth, but not the whole truth. The whole truth was the primal, unthinking instinct that had propelled her across the grass, an instinct she didn't want to examine too closely. “Fine,” Davies conceded, knowing better than to push. “But the optics are what they are. You’re the hero cop who took down the Giggle Monster. Get used to it.” He moved to his desk and slid a stack of forms toward her. “Mandatory psych debrief. A week’s paid leave, effective immediately. Don’t even think about arguing. Go home. Go swimming. Go somewhere the job can’t find you for a few days.”

Back at her desk, Isabelle stared at the mandatory leave forms with a kind of numb dread. A week with nothing but her own thoughts for company felt less like a vacation and more like a punishment. Her phone rang, the number unfamiliar. She almost ignored it, but her training kicked in. She answered with a clipped, “Greenfield.” The voice on the other end was hesitant, yet clear. “Inspector Greenfield? It’s Genevieve Tremblay.” The sound of the name jolted Isabelle. She straightened in her chair, all thoughts of leave and commendations vanishing. “Mrs. Tremblay. Is everything alright?”

“Yes, no… I don’t know,” the lawyer’s usually precise voice was frayed, fragile. “We’re at my parents’ house. Sophie is… quiet. She asked me this morning if laughing was bad. She wanted to know if the monster would come back if she laughed.” A wave of cold fury washed over Isabelle. The psychological vandalism Jennifer had wrought was her true, lasting legacy. “The doctors say it will take time,” Genevieve continued, her voice gaining a sliver of its old strength. “But that’s not why I called. I called to say… thank you is not the right word. It’s not a big enough word for what you did. For what you were willing to do.”

Isabelle murmured something noncommittal, but Genevieve pressed on, needing to articulate the thought. “When you were in our house, explaining the situation… Alistair and I, we were frozen. We’re planners, we control things for a living, and we had no control. But you… you seemed to know exactly what to do. That night, on the lawn… you weren’t just a police officer. I saw your face. You were a mother protecting a child.” The observation landed with the force of a physical blow, striking a nerve so deep Isabelle felt herself flinch. She had no response. “I just wanted you to know,” Genevieve finished softly. “I saw it. And I will be grateful for it for the rest of my life.”

The line went dead, leaving Isabelle in a profound silence, the lawyer’s words echoing in the empty space. *You were a mother protecting a child.* She had been. The thought was terrifying and liberating all at once. For years, she had compartmentalized, convincing herself that the ferocity she brought to her job was a professional attribute, a function of her role. But Genevieve Tremblay, a stranger, had seen through the uniform to the primal engine beneath. She had been protecting Sophie, but she had also been fighting for Chloe, for the laughing girl in the photograph, for the child she had driven away with the very same intensity she now used to save others. She had poured all her fierce, protective, maternal love into a job that gave her strangers to save, because she no longer knew how to give it to her own daughter.

Her phone buzzed on the desk, a notification lighting up the screen. It was another message from Chloe. Her heart hammered against her bruised ribs as she opened it. The message was just two words. *I’m free now.* Isabelle stared at the screen, the two words a doorway opening in a wall she had long thought was solid brick. She could text back, arrange a time, a place, another safe, mediated step. But the water had taught her that hesitation was a form of sinking. Genevieve’s words still rang in her ears. Before the professional, before the cop, before the tired woman, she was a mother. With a hand that was surprisingly steady, she navigated to her contacts and pressed the call icon next to Chloe’s name. The phone began to ring, the electronic tone a sound of pure, terrifying suspense. She held her breath, waiting.The ringing in her ear was a thin, electronic blade, each pulse sawing at the fragile quiet she had dared to create. It was a sound of pure potential, capable of becoming a slammed door or a cracked-open window. Isabelle held her breath, a habit learned in the deep water, conserving oxygen for a dive into an unknown place. Three rings. Four. She was about to hang up, to retreat to the safety of her failure, when the ringing stopped. There was a click, a beat of dead air, and then a voice she knew as well as her own, but made unfamiliar by time and distance.

“Mom?”

Chloe’s voice was low and cautious, laced with the wariness of someone answering a call from a number they know they should have blocked. It held none of the bright, musical tones of the girl in the photograph; this was the voice of a young woman who had learned to build her own walls. Isabelle’s carefully rehearsed sentences evaporated, leaving her with nothing but the raw, unedited truth of the moment.

“Chloe. Hi.” Her own voice sounded foreign, a clumsy instrument she no longer knew how to play. The silence that followed was a chasm, filled with three years of missed birthdays, stilted holiday texts, and the vast, echoing space of things left unsaid.

“I got your text,” Chloe said, her tone unreadable. “Are you… are you really okay? The news made it look like a war zone.” There it was again. The question. A simple expression of concern that felt like a lifeline thrown across the divide. Isabelle gripped the phone tighter, her knuckles white. The old instinct was to deflect, to reassure, to say ‘It’s my job, I’m fine,’ and end the conversation. But the image of Sophie Tremblay’s small, trusting hand following a trail of blinking lights into the dark held her fast.

“No,” Isabelle heard herself say, the word coming out rougher than she intended. “No, I’m not really okay. But I will be.” The honesty felt like a betrayal of every professional instinct she had, a willing surrender of her armour. She could hear Chloe’s faint, surprised intake of breath on the other end of the line. “I’m on mandatory leave for a week,” Isabelle continued, pushing forward before she could stop herself. “I was wondering… I know you’re busy with your classes, but I’d like to see you. To talk. If you want to.”

Another silence stretched, this one more thoughtful than hostile. Isabelle could picture her daughter on the other end, chewing on her lip, her brow furrowed in indecision. She could picture the tiny apartment she’d only seen in photos, filled with art supplies and half-finished canvases, a world Chloe had built for herself, a world pointedly without Isabelle in it.

“Where?” Chloe asked finally, the single word a concession, a key turning in a rusted lock.

“The river path,” Isabelle suggested, choosing a place that was neutral, a place that belonged only to the city. “Near the old paper mill. Tomorrow? Around noon?”

“Okay,” Chloe said, her voice still cautious, but there. She was there. “Noon.” The line went dead before Isabelle could say anything else, leaving her holding the phone, the dial tone a dull, monotonous song of victory. It was the most terrifying and hopeful sound she had ever heard.

The next morning, Isabelle stood in front of her closet, utterly paralyzed. She had uniforms for every conceivable professional scenario: tactical gear for raids, a dress uniform for ceremonies, sober suits for court appearances. She had nothing for this. She had no uniform for ‘mother.’ Everything she owned felt like a costume for a role she was trying to shed. She settled on a pair of dark jeans, a soft grey sweater, and a plain black jacket, clothes that felt anonymous, clothes that she hoped wouldn’t scream ‘cop.’ As she drove towards the meeting point, she felt the familiar thrum of pre-operational anxiety, the same heightened awareness and churning stomach she got before a high-risk warrant execution. The absurdity of it was not lost on her; she was more afraid of having a conversation with her own daughter than she had been of tackling an armed woman in the dark.

She arrived early, the cold November air biting at her cheeks. The path followed the wide, grey-brown sweep of the Ottawa River, the water choppy and formidable. Across the river, the skeletal gantries of the old E.B. Eddy paper mill stood like industrial dinosaurs against the sky, a ruin of a past era. They had walked here when Chloe was little, collecting smooth, flat stones and watching the barges move slowly upriver. It had been before. Before the job had consumed her, before her daughter’s laughter had been replaced by a quiet, simmering resentment.

She saw Chloe before Chloe saw her. She was walking along the path, her head down, hands jammed into the pockets of a paint-splattered denim jacket that was a size too big. Her dark hair was shorter than Isabelle remembered, tucked behind her ears. She was no longer a girl playing at being a grown-up; she was a young woman, and the sight of her, so familiar and so strange, stole the air from Isabelle’s lungs. As Chloe looked up and their eyes met, Isabelle saw the guarded, watchful expression she had expected, but underneath it, there was a flicker of the same anxiety she felt churning in her own stomach. They were two strangers, armed with a shared history, meeting on a battlefield of their own making.They met in the middle of the path, two ships passing in a fog of their own making. A few feet of gravel and dead leaves separated them, an impassable gulf. Isabelle saw the guarded appraisal in her daughter’s eyes, the way Chloe’s posture was a carefully constructed shield. The paint-splattered jacket was her uniform, the hardened set of her jaw her body armour. The years had sharpened the soft lines of her face into something more defined, more defiant.

“Hello, Chloe,” Isabelle said, the words feeling inadequate, ridiculously formal.

“Hi,” Chloe replied, her voice carefully neutral. Her gaze flickered to Isabelle’s cheek, where a faint purple bruise was beginning to bloom, then quickly away, as if looking too long was a breach of some unspoken treaty. They stood in a silence that was louder than any argument they’d ever had, the rushing of the river a dull roar in the background. It was Chloe who broke it, beginning to walk slowly along the path, forcing Isabelle to fall into step beside her, a careful foot of space still between them.

“So the news is calling you a hero,” Chloe said, her tone pitched somewhere between a question and an accusation. “Taking down the Giggle Monster. Sounds like one of the stories you used to tell me, only this one was real.” The barb was subtle but sharp, a reminder of a time when Isabelle’s dark world had been filtered into cautionary tales for a child, before the filter had disintegrated entirely.

“It wasn't a story,” Isabelle said, her voice quiet. She resisted the urge to give the police report, to list the facts, to retreat into the sterile safety of her profession. She kept her eyes on the churning grey water. “It was a mess. A very ugly, human mess.”

They walked another twenty paces in silence before Chloe stopped, turning to face her fully. The wind whipped a strand of dark hair across her face, and she tucked it impatiently behind her ear. “Why did you call, Mom? After all this time. Was it because you almost got killed? Is this some kind of post-traumatic… thing?” She wanted to categorize it, to put it in a box she could understand. She wanted to know if this fleeting connection was just another symptom of her mother’s violent world, a temporary reaction to a brush with death.

Isabelle looked at her daughter, at the young woman who had been forced to grow up in the shadow of so much darkness, and she knew that a lie, or even a partial truth, would be the end of it. This was the only chance she might get. “The mother of the little girl… Sophie. Her name is Genevieve. She called me this morning.” Isabelle’s voice was low, stripped of all authority, all artifice. “She thanked me. But she said she saw something on the lawn that night. She said she didn’t just see a cop. She said she saw a mother protecting a child.”

She let the words hang in the cold air between them, a confession laid bare. “And she was right. But it wasn’t just her child I was fighting for, Chloe. For years, I’ve been running into fires for strangers, fighting monsters for other people’s families… because I didn’t know how to fight for my own. Because I’d already lost.”

Chloe’s reaction was not what Isabelle expected. It wasn’t anger, not right away. It was a flash of deep, profound pain that she quickly tried to mask. Her face hardened, her shield snapping back into place. “You didn’t lose, Mom. You surrendered. You chose them. You chose the dead over the living, every single time.” Her voice was low and shaking with a fury that had been simmering for years. “You brought the job home. It was in your eyes, on your clothes. The station followed you like a ghost. I’d be telling you about a test or a friend, and you’d be looking through me, still seeing a crime scene. I couldn’t paint in that house. I couldn’t breathe. There were no colours left. There was just the grey of your files and the yellow of your police tape. I had to leave to remember what red and blue looked like.”

Every word was a perfectly aimed dart, and Isabelle didn’t flinch. She stood and took it, all of it, because it was true. This was the other side of the report, the impact statement from a victim she had never officially catalogued. She had shoved chaos back in its box at work, only to bring the box home and let it seep out all over the one person she was supposed to keep safe. When Chloe’s words finally ran out, leaving her breathless and shaking, Isabelle didn’t offer a defense. She didn’t offer an excuse. She just nodded, a slow, painful acknowledgment.

“You’re right,” she whispered, the admission costing her more than any physical blow ever had. “I’m sorry. I am so, so sorry that I let the job eat me alive. And I’m sorry that it was so hungry, it ate you, too.”

The apology, so direct and unadorned, seemed to knock the remaining fight out of Chloe. Her shoulders, which had been rigid with anger, slumped. She turned away from Isabelle, looking out at the river, and furiously wiped at her eyes with the back of her sleeve. For a long moment, the only sound was the wind and the water and the distant cry of a gull. The air between them had changed. The tension had not vanished, but it had transformed from a high, taut wire into a low, mournful hum.

Isabelle took a tentative step closer, closing the distance between them by half. “What are you painting now?” she asked, the question soft, an offering.

Chloe took a deep, shuddering breath before she answered, her voice still thick. “It’s a series. Cityscapes. But at night. Just the lights. The way they look when you’re far away. Like constellations that fell out of the sky.”

Isabelle could picture it. A city made of light, the darkness held at bay. It was a world of beauty found in the gloom, a perspective she had long since lost. They began to walk again, side-by-side. The foot of space between them had shrunk to inches. Their shoulders almost brushed. The path ahead was long and uncertain, obscured by the low-hanging grey of the November sky, but for the first time in a very long time, they were walking on it together.They continued along the path, the river a vast, moving silence beside them. The conversation, having breached the dam of anger, now flowed in a slow, uncertain stream. Isabelle, acting on an instinct she didn’t know she possessed, kept the focus on the one topic that was purely Chloe’s. It was a safer country, a landscape she had not yet strip-mined with her own darkness. She asked about the paint, the canvases, the way Chloe managed to capture the specific quality of streetlight on wet pavement. It was the careful, fact-finding language of her profession, but applied with a gentle curiosity that felt entirely new.

For her part, Chloe answered in clipped, hesitant phrases at first, as if expecting her words to be filed away as evidence. But as Isabelle listened, truly listened, without interruption or judgment, Chloe’s defensiveness began to soften. She spoke of the challenge of painting light, of how it wasn’t the bright parts that were interesting, but the edges where the light met the dark and created something new. She talked about the different kinds of black, the way a night sky was never truly black but a deep, bruised purple or an abyssal blue. She spoke with the quiet, focused passion of an artist completely immersed in her world, and for the first time, Isabelle saw her not as the daughter she had lost, but as the woman she had become—a creator who found her truth in the shadows.

The path curved towards an old, rusted railway bridge, a natural endpoint to their walk. The moment hung between them, a choice point. They could part now, a fragile peace declared, and retreat to their separate corners. The thought was unbearable to Isabelle. She had to anchor this moment, to give it a chance to become more than a fleeting truce. “I’m on leave for the week,” she said, the words feeling clumsy. “Davies’ orders. I was wondering… are you hungry? We could grab something. My treat.” The offer felt like laying a weapon on the ground, a gesture of profound vulnerability. She half-expected Chloe to refuse, to say she had to get back to her studio, to re-erect the wall between them.

Chloe stopped and looked at her, really looked at her, and Isabelle saw the internal debate warring in her daughter’s eyes. To accept was to consent to more time, to let this fragile reconnection breathe a little longer. To refuse was to retreat to the familiar, cold safety of their estrangement. “There’s a place a few blocks from here,” Chloe said finally, her voice quiet but decisive. “It’s small. The coffee doesn’t taste like burnt plastic.” She turned and started walking away from the river, not waiting to see if Isabelle would follow. It was an acceptance, but on her own terms, in her own territory. Isabelle followed, a silent, profound relief washing over her.

The café was everything the police station was not. It was small and warm, smelling of dark roast coffee, cinnamon, and turpentine from a nearby art co-op. The walls were covered in a chaotic collage of local artists’ work, vibrant and alive. It was Chloe’s world. They found a small table in the corner, the worn wood of its surface a stark contrast to the cold metal of an interrogation room. The simple, mundane act of ordering—a black coffee for Isabelle, a chai latte for Chloe—created a brief, welcome buffer. When the drinks came, they sat holding the warm mugs like shields, the silence returning, this time more awkward than hostile.

“So, mandatory leave,” Chloe said, breaking the quiet. She cradled her mug in both hands, her fingernails smudged with green paint. “What does the city’s greatest detective do when she’s not detecting?” There was a gentle teasing in her tone now, the sharp edge of her earlier sarcasm blunted. “They don’t really know what to do with me if I’m not on a case,” Isabelle admitted with a small, wry smile. “I think Davies is half-afraid I’ll start investigating my neighbours for overdue library books.” The confession, a small admission of her own obsessive nature, drew a flicker of a genuine smile from Chloe. “Yeah,” she said softly. “I know the feeling.” It was a shared moment, a tiny piece of common ground built on a painful history.

As they sat in that fragile peace, Isabelle’s eyes drifted to a stack of newspapers by the counter. The front page of the Ottawa Citizen was stark and unavoidable. A grainy photo of Jennifer Holloway being led away in handcuffs was splashed above a bold, lurid headline: THE GIGGLE MONSTER IN CUSTODY. Isabelle felt an involuntary tightening in her gut, her shoulders tensing as the cop persona tried to reassert control. The sounds of the café faded, replaced by the memory of Jennifer’s hateful whisper in the interrogation room. The case was a tide that was always trying to pull her back under.

Chloe saw the shift instantly. She saw the light go out of Isabelle’s eyes, saw her gaze harden, saw the woman across the table transform back into the detective. Chloe’s own expression tightened, a reflexive flinch, bracing for the wall to go back up. It was the old, familiar dance. The job had just walked into the room and demanded Isabelle’s attention. But this time, something was different. Isabelle felt Chloe’s retreat, saw the disappointment cloud her daughter’s face. She made a conscious choice. With a visible effort, she broke her gaze from the newspaper, turned her body fully back to her daughter, and met her eyes. “Sorry,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. “Old habits.” It was more than an apology for being distracted; it was an apology for a thousand similar moments, a thousand dinners interrupted by a phone call, a thousand conversations lost to a distant, haunted stare.

A small, almost imperceptible shift happened in Chloe’s posture. She didn’t smile, but the hard, defensive line of her shoulders softened. She had seen the effort. She had seen her mother actively choose her, in this small, quiet moment, over the ghosts. She took a sip of her latte, her eyes holding Isabelle’s over the rim of the mug. “You should swim,” she said, the sudden change of topic surprising Isabelle. “When I was little, you used to say the lake was the only place that was quiet.”

The memory, offered up so freely, was a gift. Isabelle had forgotten she’d ever said that to her, forgotten that Chloe had been listening. “I still do,” Isabelle confessed. “Every morning I can. It’s… my church.” She had never used that word to describe it to anyone, and it felt shockingly intimate to say it to her daughter now. She was offering a piece of herself back, not the cop, but the swimmer. A private truth for a private truth.

The coffee grew cold in their cups as they talked, the conversation drifting like a boat on a calm sea. They didn't solve the past. They didn’t chart a map for the future. They just talked. About Chloe’s art professor, about Isabelle’s aching shoulders, about a funny movie Chloe had seen, about the ridiculous number of squirrels on Parliament Hill. They talked about nothing, and in doing so, they talked about everything. When they finally stepped back out into the sharp, cold air, the sun was lower in the sky. The goodbye was as awkward as the hello, a clumsy dance of people who had forgotten the steps. “I should… get back,” Chloe said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of her apartment. “Thanks for the coffee.”

“Chloe, wait,” Isabelle said, a sudden urgency seizing her. “Maybe… before my week is up… could we do this again?” The question was out before she could second-guess it, a raw, hopeful plea. Chloe looked down at her paint-stained boots, then back up at her mother. A small, genuine smile finally reached her eyes, transforming her face, making her look for a fleeting second like the girl in the photograph. “Yeah, Mom,” she said. “I’d like that.” Isabelle watched her walk away, her too-big jacket a familiar silhouette against the backdrop of the city, until she rounded a corner and was gone. Isabelle stood on the sidewalk, the noise of the traffic a distant hum. The bruise on her cheek throbbed with a dull ache, a souvenir from a battle won. But the fragile promise of another coffee, of another conversation, was a quieter, deeper victory, and it warmed her in a way no commendation or closed case ever could.The morning after her first real conversation with Chloe in three years, the water of Dow’s Lake felt different. The cold was the same, a deep, pervasive chill that seized her muscles and demanded respect, but the indifference no longer felt like a judgment. It felt like a space. A vast, quiet emptiness where she could finally think. As her arms carved through the black silk, the familiar mantra of stroke, breathe, stroke, breathe, took on a new cadence. It was no longer a frantic scrubbing of her mind, an effort to scour away the city’s grime. It was a rhythm of consideration, a measured beat against which she could replay the events of the previous day. She saw Chloe’s face, not as the ghost of the laughing girl in the photograph, but as the wary, intelligent, and fiercely independent woman who had met her on the river path. She heard her daughter’s voice, the accusation and the pain, but also the fragile offering of shared coffee in a warm, bright place. *There were no colours left.* The words echoed in her head, more damning than any of Jennifer Holloway’s poisoned prose. For the first time, her morning swim was not an escape from the city’s darkness, but an immersion in her own. The fight against the water’s resistance was no longer just about endurance; it was about moving through a lifetime of her own making, stroke by painful stroke.

Her first full day of mandatory leave was a quiet, personal hell. The silence in her apartment, usually a welcome respite from the station's chaotic hum, was now a roaring vacuum. It was a space designed for one person, for a life that was compartmentalized and orderly. Every surface was clean, every object had its place. It was a fortress built against the mess of the world, and she now saw, with a clarity that was deeply uncomfortable, that it was also a fortress built against the mess of life itself. She tried to read a novel, but the fictional characters and their manufactured problems felt trivial. She put on music, but it was just noise filling a void. She stood in front of the television, remote in hand, and realized she had no idea what normal people watched when the world wasn’t ending. The absence of a crisis left her adrift. The constant, low-grade hum of anxiety that had been her companion for two decades was gone, and she was left with a disorienting sense of stillness. Her entire being was wired for the next call, the next case, the next threat. Without it, she felt like a machine that had been abruptly unplugged, her own thoughts the only feedback loop, and they were all leading her back to Chloe.

They met two days later, the text message from Chloe agreeing to the meeting a small, glowing beacon in Isabelle’s formless week. Chloe had suggested her studio, a proposition that felt both like a test and a profound act of trust. The building was an old converted warehouse in Hintonburg, the air in the hallways thick with the layered scents of linseed oil, clay, and coffee. Chloe’s studio was on the third floor, a large, open room with a massive north-facing window that flooded the space with a cool, even light. And colour. The room was an explosion of it. Canvases in various states of completion were stacked against the walls, their vibrant surfaces a riot of reds, blues, and electric yellows. Jars crammed with brushes stood on paint-splattered tables. Scraps of paper with charcoal sketches were tacked to a corkboard. It was messy, chaotic, and more alive than any space Isabelle had been in for years. It was the absolute antithesis of her own sterile apartment, and it was the most beautiful room she had ever seen.

Chloe seemed more at ease here, in her own element. The paint-splattered jacket was gone, replaced by an oversized, equally stained sweatshirt. She moved through the space with an unconscious grace, stepping over a stack of canvases as she went to put on a kettle. Isabelle felt like an intruder, a monochrome figure in a world of pigment. Her eyes were drawn to the largest canvas, one that was nearly finished. It was a cityscape at night, just as Chloe had described. A view from a high bridge, looking down on the skeins of traffic, the headlights and taillights bleeding into long streaks of red and white. But it wasn’t just a realistic depiction. Chloe had imbued the darkness with depth and texture, and the lights were not just points of illumination but living, breathing entities, like comets streaking through a deep, velvet cosmos. It was her city, Isabelle’s city of crime and despair, but seen through her daughter’s eyes, it was a thing of breathtaking, heartbreaking beauty. “It’s beautiful,” Isabelle said, her voice softer than she intended. “I’ve never seen it like that.” Chloe looked over from the kettle, a flicker of surprise and pleasure in her eyes. “Most people don’t,” she said simply. “They only see the dark.”

As Chloe made tea, Isabelle wandered deeper into the studio, her detective’s eyes instinctively taking in the details, cataloguing the evidence of a life. She saw a photo of a smiling young man tacked to the wall, a half-eaten bag of chips on a stool, a textbook on Renaissance art lying open. Her gaze fell on a series of smaller, unframed canvases stacked in a corner. They were different from the cityscapes. They were abstract, angry slashes of black and grey and a furious, bloody red. The paint was thick, applied with a violence that was almost sculptural. “What are these?” Isabelle asked, her tone shifting, the question more of an observation than an inquiry. Chloe turned, and the easy atmosphere in the room instantly evaporated. Her face closed off. “Nothing,” she said, her voice tight. “Just… exercises.” Isabelle knew she’d made a mistake. The cop had surfaced, analyzing, categorizing. She had looked at the paintings not as art, but as a psychological profile, and Chloe had felt it instantly. “They feel… angry,” Isabelle said, trying to recover, but only making it worse. “It’s just paint, Mom,” Chloe said, her voice flat and cold. “You don’t need to interrogate it.”

The wall was back up, higher and colder than before. They drank their tea in a tense silence, the vibrant colours of the studio suddenly feeling muted. Isabelle’s mind raced, searching for a way to undo the damage, to prove she could be present without dissecting everything she saw. She thought of her own world, her own rituals. “The lake was cold this morning,” she said, the non-sequitur a desperate gambit. “There was ice forming at the edges. I had to break through it to get in.” She didn’t look at Chloe, just stared into her own cup of tea. “It hurts when you first get in. A sharp, burning kind of pain. You think you can’t breathe. But you force yourself to push through it, to find a rhythm. And after a while… the pain is still there, but you learn to move with it. It becomes part of the motion.” She looked up, meeting her daughter’s wary gaze. “I don’t know anything about paint, Chloe. But I know about that.” Chloe was silent for a long moment, studying her mother’s face. She saw the bruise on her cheek, the exhaustion in her eyes, the raw honesty of the admission. She gave a slow, small nod. The wall didn’t come down, but a small gate had been opened in it. “Yeah,” Chloe whispered. “I know about that, too.”

When Isabelle left the studio an hour later, the fragile peace was restored, but the lesson of the visit was seared into her mind. She drove home not to her apartment, but to a large garden centre on the outskirts of the city. She walked through the humid, earthy-smelling aisles, feeling as out of place as she had in Chloe’s studio. She didn’t know the names of the plants, didn’t know which ones needed sun or shade. She just looked for colour. She found a small, flowering orchid, its petals a shade of deep, impossible magenta, a colour so vibrant it almost hurt to look at. She bought it, along with a simple ceramic pot. Back in her apartment, she cleared a space on her perfectly ordered windowsill, displacing a neat stack of case-law books. She placed the orchid in the sunlight, its brilliant, living colour a shocking intrusion into the monochrome calm of her home. It looked messy. It looked out of place. It looked like a start.The orchid was a stubborn splash of life on Isabelle’s windowsill, a defiant act of colour against the grey November sky. It became the focal point of her days on leave. She, who could keep the intricate details of a dozen cold cases in her head, now found herself obsessively researching the proper care for a Phalaenopsis. How much water? How much light? It was a problem with a solution, a puzzle with knowable parameters, and she clung to it like a life raft in the vast, still ocean of her empty schedule. The silence of her apartment was a low-grade fever. She would find herself standing in the middle of the living room, hands on her hips, possessed by a frantic energy with nowhere to go. She was a finely tuned instrument of crisis, and in its absence, all her strings vibrated with a discordant, aimless hum. She was learning, with excruciating slowness, that the hardest case to solve was what to do with herself when there was no case at all.

Her morning swims became less of an escape and more of a pilgrimage. In the deep, silent cold of the lake, she would deconstruct her visits with Chloe, replaying every word, every gesture, every flicker of expression. She saw the flash of pain in her daughter’s eyes when she had analyzed the angry, abstract paintings. *It’s just paint, Mom. You don’t need to interrogate it.* The words were a quiet indictment of her entire way of being. For two decades, she had looked at the world as a collection of clues, a series of crime scenes waiting to be processed. She had brought that lens home, and she had aimed it at her own child, trying to analyze her daughter’s pain instead of simply sitting with it. She had treated Chloe’s life as a file to be understood rather than a person to be loved. The realization was a sharp, cold stone in her gut, heavier than any weight she had ever carried. As she pulled herself from the water each morning, the clean pain in her shoulders felt different—it felt like the ache of a muscle being used for the first time in a very long time.

The call from Superintendent Davies came on the fourth day of her leave, a familiar, jarring summons from a world she was trying to hold at arm’s length. The sound of his voice, weary and freighted with official business, was a siren song, pulling her back toward the rocks. “Izzy, sorry to bother you on your time off,” he began, a perfunctory apology he didn’t mean. “Holloway is playing games. She’s lawyered up, and she’s refusing to speak. Complete stonewall. Except for one thing. She says she’ll talk, but only to you. Her psych eval came back. Off the charts narcissism, persecution complex, the whole textbook. She thinks she’s the victim here, and you’re the only one who ‘understands the narrative.’ She’s trying to pull you into her story, make you a character in her next chapter.” He paused, and Isabelle could hear the unspoken question, the hope in his voice. “I know you’re on leave, but if you were willing to go in, just once…”

The old Isabelle, the one from a week ago, would have already been putting on her shoes. The lure of the interrogation room, the intellectual combat, the satisfaction of cracking a subject who thought they were unbreakable—it was a drug. She could feel the phantom pull of it, the twitch in her muscles to get back in the game. But then she looked across her living room at the impossible magenta of the orchid on the windowsill. It was a small, fragile thing, but it held its space. It was a promise she had made to herself. “No, sir,” she said, the word feeling both foreign and powerful on her tongue. “I’m on leave. You told me to go somewhere the job couldn’t find me. I’m trying to do that.” A stunned silence met her on the other end of the line. She had never, in twenty years, refused him. “Let her sit,” Isabelle continued, her voice firm. “Let her sit in a quiet room with no audience. It’s the worst punishment you could give her. My report is complete. Let the Crown handle it from here.” She ended the call before he could argue, a profound sense of both terror and liberation washing over her. She had just drawn a boundary, not for a crime scene, but for herself.

Their next meeting was at the National Gallery. It was Isabelle’s suggestion, a conscious effort to meet Chloe on her own ground, a building dedicated to light and colour and perspective. They walked through the soaring, sunlit corridors, the quiet reverence of the space a calming influence. They stopped in a room dedicated to the Group of Seven, the walls alive with the wild, untamed landscapes of the Canadian wilderness. They stood before a Tom Thomson, a chaotic, vibrant scene of a northern lake, the paint laid on in thick, energetic strokes. “Look at the sky,” Chloe said, her voice low, full of a quiet passion. “He’s not just painting clouds. He’s painting the wind. You can feel the cold in that blue.” Isabelle looked, and for the first time, she wasn’t trying to analyze it. She was just seeing. “It looks like the lake before dawn,” she said, the words surprising her. “After the stars have faded but before the sun has really come up. The water and the sky are the same colour. It’s so quiet you can hear your own heartbeat.” She was speaking Chloe’s language, connecting the art to her own small, private world. Chloe turned to her, a look of genuine surprise on her face. “Yeah,” she said softly. “Exactly like that.”

It was Chloe who brought up the case, her tone now one of genuine, morbid curiosity rather than accusation. “What happens to her now? To the woman?” she asked as they wandered into a hall of stark modern sculptures. “Does she just… go away forever?” It was an opening, a chance for Isabelle to share the reality of her world without the grim weight of an active investigation. Isabelle took a deep breath, choosing her words with care. “It’s a slow process,” she began. “Hearings, motions, a trial, eventually. The system grinds it all down. Justice is mostly paperwork.” She paused, looking at a twisted sculpture of rusted metal that reminded her of Jennifer’s psyche. “But her? She built her own prison a long time ago, Chloe. She walled herself up with envy and resentment until it was all she could see. The scariest thing about her wasn’t some grand, brilliant evil. It was how small she was. How pathetic. All that horror, all that pain she caused… it was born from the simple, ugly fact that she hated people for having things she thought she deserved. She didn’t want to build a better life for herself. She just wanted to burn theirs down.”

They were leaving the gallery, stepping out from the soaring, glass-walled Great Hall into the fading light of the afternoon. The Peace Tower stood stoic in the distance, a familiar postcard image. But for the first time, Isabelle saw it not as a bitter joke, but just as a part of the city, her city, the same city her daughter was painting in brilliant, streaking lights. “The student exhibition is next month,” Chloe said suddenly, her gaze fixed on the sidewalk, her hands shoved deep in her pockets. “At the art school. It’s a big deal, I guess. My cityscape… the big one… they chose it for the show.” She looked up, and her eyes, clear and direct, met Isabelle’s. “If you wanted to come… I could get you a ticket.” The invitation was hesitant, fragile, but it was a formal welcome, a key to a door Isabelle had thought was permanently locked. It was an invitation not just to a show, but into her world. The world of colour, of light, of a future Chloe was building for herself. “I’d love that,” Isabelle said, her voice catching slightly. “I wouldn’t miss it.” She watched Chloe walk away towards the bus stop, a young woman moving confidently through a city that held both their histories. Isabelle stayed for a moment, looking up at the magnificent glass structure of the gallery, a building designed to gather the light and hold it, even as the sky began to grow dark.The orchid was an insolent splash of colour in the quiet grey landscape of Isabelle Greenfield’s life. It sat on her windowsill, a living, breathing accusation against the sterile order of her apartment. She found herself talking to it, quiet admonishments about drooping leaves, murmurs of encouragement for a new bud. It was a focal point in a life that had suddenly lost its centre, a small, tangible problem to be solved with water and light. Her week of mandatory leave stretched before her, a vast, unmapped territory. For the first time in her adult life, there was no file to read, no suspect to profile, no impending crisis to manage. The silence was an active presence, and in it, she was forced to confront the wreckage of her own quiet, internal crime scenes. The city’s ghosts had been replaced by her own, and they were far more relentless.

The night of Chloe’s exhibition, a nervous, kinetic energy filled Isabelle’s apartment, a feeling she hadn't experienced since her first day as a rookie constable. She stood in front of her closet, faced with a crisis of identity far more profound than any case she had ever worked. Her entire wardrobe was a spectrum of authority, from the muted greys of a detective to the stark black of a formal uniform. There was nothing in it that simply said ‘mother.’ She finally settled on a pair of simple black trousers and a dark blue silk blouse, clothes she hoped were neutral enough to render her invisible. As she drove to the art school, her hands gripped the steering wheel with the same white-knuckled tension she felt before a raid. She was willingly walking into a world where she had no authority, no expertise, and no rank. She was not Detective Inspector Greenfield. Tonight, she was just Chloe’s mom, a title that felt both achingly familiar and terrifyingly new.

The art school was a cacophony of youthful energy. The main gallery space was packed with a loud, laughing, vibrant crowd of students and their families, a sea of creative haircuts, black-rimmed glasses, and clothes that were either artfully distressed or impeccably avant-garde. The air smelled of cheap red wine, perfume, and the faint, underlying tang of paint. It was a world brimming with possibility and a self-conscious coolness that made Isabelle feel ancient and out of place. She clutched the strap of her purse like a lifeline, a solitary, monochrome figure adrift in a tide of brilliant colour. She scanned the room, looking for Chloe, feeling the old professional habit of cataloguing faces and assessing threats kick in before she consciously forced it down. She wasn’t here to find a suspect. She was here to find her daughter.

She saw Chloe holding court near a large, abstract sculpture. She was surrounded by a small group of friends, a wine glass in one hand, gesturing with the other as she spoke. A bright, genuine laugh rang out, and Isabelle felt a pang so sharp it almost made her gasp. She was seeing a version of her daughter she had never known, a Chloe who was confident, happy, and central to her own universe. She looked completely at home. Isabelle hung back by the doorway, suddenly feeling like an intruder, a voyeur spying on a life she had no part in creating. She was about to retreat, to text Chloe that she had arrived and would wait, when Chloe’s eyes met hers across the crowded room. The bright animation on her daughter’s face didn’t falter, but a new awareness entered her eyes. She said something to her friends, excused herself, and began to make her way through the crowd toward Isabelle.

“You came,” Chloe said, her voice a mixture of surprise and something that might have been relief. She had a smudge of blue paint on her jaw that she had somehow missed. The sight of it was so endearing, so perfectly her, that Isabelle had to fight the sudden, overwhelming urge to reach out and wipe it away, a ghost of a maternal gesture from a forgotten lifetime. “I wouldn’t have missed it,” Isabelle replied, her voice steadier than she felt. Chloe hesitated for a beat, then gestured back toward her friends. “Come on, there are people I want you to meet.” She led Isabelle into the heart of the crowd, into her world. The introductions were a blur of names and faces. A lanky sculptor named Simon, a fiery photographer named Aisha. They greeted Isabelle with a casual, friendly curiosity, their gazes open and unburdened by the knowledge of what she did for a living. To them, she was not a homicide detective. She was just Chloe’s mom, the woman in the nice silk blouse. Isabelle found herself making small talk, asking about their work, listening as they spoke with passionate intensity about their projects. She was performing a role she had long forgotten how to play, and to her astonishment, it began to feel real.

After a few minutes of polite conversation, Chloe touched her arm. “Come on,” she said, her voice lower now, a new nervousness in it. “It’s this way.” She led Isabelle away from the thrumming centre of the gallery into a slightly quieter, adjacent room. And there it was. It hung on the far wall, dominating the space, a canvas so large it felt less like a painting and more like a window. The title on the small white card beside it read: ‘Constellation, No. 3 (Ottawa)’. It was the cityscape from her studio, but it was so much more than she remembered. Seen here, under the focused gallery lights, it was a living, breathing entity. The perspective was from a great height, looking down on the intricate web of the city at night. The blacks and blues of the darkness were layered and deep, full of a texture that suggested not emptiness but a vast, silent depth. And the lights—the pinpricks of streetlamps, the warm squares of distant windows, the streaking comets of headlights on the Queensway—were not just dabs of paint. They were brilliant, explosive bursts of colour, each one a tiny, defiant star burning against the immense, overwhelming dark.

Isabelle stood before it, utterly still. The noise of the gallery, the wine, the crowd—it all faded away into a distant hum. She was not looking at a painting of a city; she was looking at a map of her own life, her own soul, as seen through the eyes of the one person she had hurt the most. She saw the darkness, the endless, sprawling night she navigated every single day, the world of violence and loss and decay. It was all there, in the profound, abyssal depths of Chloe’s canvas. But she also saw the lights. The thousands upon thousands of tiny, fierce points of life, of hope, of people living and loving and carrying on despite the vast darkness that surrounded them. She saw the beauty not in spite of the night, but because of it. Chloe hadn’t ignored the darkness her mother had brought into her life. She had stared into it, understood it, and had found the light within it anyway. A hot, sharp pressure built behind Isabelle’s eyes, a feeling so unfamiliar she didn’t recognize it at first. It was grief. It was pride. It was a love so fierce it felt like a wound.

“It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,” Isabelle whispered, the words a raw, broken sound in the quiet space. She turned to look at her daughter, oblivious to the single tear that was tracing a path down her bruised cheek. Chloe stood watching her, her own eyes bright with unshed tears, her expression one of profound, searching vulnerability. “You see it, then?” Chloe asked, her voice barely audible. Isabelle reached out, not thinking, and took her daughter’s hand. Her fingers were cool and smooth, and Isabelle held on as if she were a drowning woman. “I see it,” Isabelle confirmed, her voice thick with emotion. “It’s what I do. I spend all my time in the dark, looking for the monsters. I think… I think I forgot to look for the stars.”

Chloe’s fingers tightened around her mother’s. The last wall between them, the one built of old grief and stubborn resentment, did not so much crumble as dissolve, washed away in a shared moment of seeing and being seen. Chloe leaned in and rested her head on Isabelle’s shoulder, a gesture of comfort and forgiveness that was so unexpected, so deeply yearned for, that Isabelle had to close her eyes against the overwhelming flood of it. They stood like that for a long time, mother and daughter, two women who had found their way back to each other not by ignoring the darkness that had separated them, but by finally agreeing to look at it together, and to call the light by its proper name.
