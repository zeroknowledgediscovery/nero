From the twenty-second floor of The Glasshouse, Newcastle unfolded itself like a crumpled map someone was trying to smooth flat, the Tyne a dark, jagged tear held together by the staples of its famous bridges. Josie had once found a certain detached beauty in it. She’d point out the landmarks to the tourists, the ones with wallets fatter than their guidebooks, tracing the curve of the Millennium Bridge with a polished fingernail. “Looks like a blinking eye, that one,” she’d say, and they’d nod, impressed, before ordering another bottle of Chablis that cost more than her week’s rent. The view was part of the package, the main attraction. You weren’t just paying for seared scallops with a parsnip purée; you were paying for the illusion of floating above the city, a king in his castle of glass and steel.

Tonight, the illusion was wearing thin. The glass, which was meant to be invisible, a seamless barrier between the cosseted diners and the northern sky, seemed to ripple at the edges of her vision. It was a trick of the light, she told herself, the reflection of a hundred tiny candles and the low-slung designer lighting. But the feeling persisted. A low, thrumming vibration she felt not in her ears but in the soles of her sensible black flats. It felt like the building was breathing. A slow, deep inhale and a shuddering exhale that travelled up her shins and settled as a cold knot in her stomach. She paused, a tray laden with empty champagne flutes balanced on one palm, and pressed her other hand against the cool, unyielding surface of the window. Solid. Of course it was solid. Just a building. Just glass. She was being daft.

“Got a hot date with the window, have you, pet?” Tasha’s voice was dry as a bone, cutting through Josie’s momentary trance. She swept past, a whirlwind of efficiency, scooping up a dessert menu from a recently vacated table. Tasha moved like she was on rails, her focus never wavering from the next task, the next tip, the next clocked-out minute. “Table seven are looking antsy for the bill. Henderson’s doing his prowler impression by the kitchen door.”

“Aye, I’m on it,” Josie muttered, pulling her hand back from the glass. Her palm felt clammy. She forced a smile that felt like cracking plaster. “Just admiring the view.”

Tasha snorted, a delicate, unimpressed sound. “If I have to look at the Tyne Bridge one more time, I reckon I’ll chuck myself off it. Be quicker than waiting for the last table to bugger off on a Tuesday.” She was already gone, weaving through the maze of tables, her sharp elbows and sharper wit clearing a path.

Josie took a deep breath, the air thick with the competing smells of expensive perfume, grilled fish, and the faint, acidic tang of floor polish. She moved towards table seven, the journey of twenty feet feeling strangely precarious. The floor, a dark, polished marble that reflected the city lights below like a bottomless black water, seemed to tilt. Just for a second. A tiny, sickening lurch that made her lock her knees. She stopped again, gripping the back of an empty chair. The couple at table seven, engrossed in their own hushed conversation, didn't notice. No one did. But her heart was hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. This was new. She’d felt moments of unease before, a fleeting dizziness when she looked straight down, but this was different. This was a physical, gut-wrenching certainty that the floor was about to give way, that she and the chair and table seven were about to be tipped out into the vast, indifferent emptiness.

She closed her eyes. Counted to three. *One. You’re on the twenty-second floor. Two. You’ve been working here for three years. Three. The floor is not made of treacle.* It was a stupid little mantra her mam, Sharon, had taught her for exams. It didn’t really work for this. When she opened her eyes, the world had righted itself. The floor was just a floor again. She swallowed the coppery taste of panic and continued her journey, her steps unnaturally deliberate.

“Here yous are,” she said, her voice a little too bright as she placed the leather-bound bill folder on the table. “No rush at all.”

The man grunted his thanks without looking up. Josie retreated, her back screaming with the need to press itself against a solid wall, any wall, as long as it wasn't made of glass. She sought refuge in the familiar chaos of the service station, the clatter of cutlery and the hiss of the coffee machine a comforting cacophony. She leaned against the stainless-steel counter, the cold seeping through the thin fabric of her uniform.

It had been getting worse for weeks. It started as a background hum of anxiety, a heightened awareness of the drop. Then came the dreams. Not falling, but floating. Powerless, bumping gently against the massive panes of The Glasshouse, with the whole of the city watching her. She’d wake up tangled in her duvet, her sheets damp with sweat. During the day, she’d find herself mapping routes across the restaurant floor that kept her as far from the windows as possible, a subconscious choreography of avoidance. She’d volunteer to run food for the tables in the centre, leaving the prime-view real estate to Tasha and the others. Tasha, who thrived on the big-spending window-gazers, hadn’t complained. She probably just thought Josie was being lazy. Maybe she was. Maybe this was all just some elaborate form of skiving her brain had invented.

“Josie!” Mr. Henderson’s voice was a sharp bark. He stood, as Tasha had predicted, by the kitchen door, his arms crossed over his pristine white shirt. His hair was meticulously slicked back, and his expression was permanently pinched, as if he’d just sniffed something off. “We are running a high-end dining establishment, not a community centre for daydreamers. Table twelve. Two G&Ts. Now.”

“Sorry, Mr. Henderson,” she mumbled, pushing herself off the counter. Her legs felt like lead.

Table twelve was her worst nightmare. A corner table, flanked on two sides by floor-to-ceiling glass. On a clear night, it felt like you were sitting in the cockpit of a spaceship. Tonight, a soft rain had begun to fall, and the city lights blurred into streaks of neon watercolour. The drops spattered against the window, each one a tiny, insistent tap-tap-tapping. *Let us in. Let us in.*

She made the drinks at the bar, her hands moving with the muscle memory of her trade. Gordon’s, a sliver of lime, the satisfying fizz of the tonic. The familiar ritual was calming. She could do this. It was just carrying two glasses. She’d carried thousands of glasses. She’d carried precarious towers of plates, heavy trays of steak dinners, three-tiered afternoon tea stands. She was good at her job. She was steady.

She picked up the glasses, the condensation cold against her fingers. As she approached the table, the low hum in her bones returned, louder this time. The floor seemed to swell and dip beneath her feet. She fixed her eyes on the table, a fixed point in a swimming world. Don’t look out. Don’t look down. The two people at the table were a blur. All she could see was the wooden surface of their table, a tiny island of safety.

She was almost there. A few more steps. But then the man at the table laughed, a loud, booming sound, and gestured out of the window with a sweep of his arm. “Look at that! You can see all the way to the coast!”

Her eyes, against her will, followed his gesture. And she broke her own rule. She looked down.

The world fell away.

It wasn't a gentle slide; it was a violent, instantaneous plunge. The lights of the cars on the Redheugh Bridge became a frantic, dizzying swarm of fireflies. The river was a slash of absolute black. The rain-slicked streets gleamed like exposed veins. There was nothing beneath her. Nothing but twenty-two storeys of air and a hard, unforgiving pavement. The glass vanished. The floor vanished. Her breath caught in her throat, a strangled, silent scream. The glasses slipped from her numb fingers.

The sound was shockingly loud in the hushed restaurant. A sharp, explosive crash, followed by the tinkle of shattering glass. Tonic water and gin soaked into the plush carpet. The whole restaurant went silent. Every head turned. Josie stood frozen, her hands still held out in front of her as if they were holding the ghosts of the glasses. Her gaze was locked on the spot on the floor where they had shattered, but she wasn’t seeing it. She was seeing the drop. The endless, terrifying drop. Her heart was a wild thing trying to batter its way out of her chest. The thrumming in her bones became a violent shudder that shook her whole frame.

“For God’s sake.” The voice belonged to the woman at table twelve, sharp with annoyance.

Then other voices bled in. A murmur that rippled through the room. Tasha appeared at her side, a dustpan and brush already in her hand. “What is wrong with you tonight, Josie? Are you drunk?” she hissed, her face a mask of furious embarrassment.

Josie couldn’t answer. She couldn’t move. She just stared at the floor, at the puddle of gin and the glittering shards of glass, and felt the chasm opening up beneath her. Mr. Henderson was there then, his face puce. He grabbed her by the elbow, his fingers digging in like talons.

“My office. Now.” His voice was a low, dangerous growl. He half-dragged her away from the scene, past the staring, judging eyes of the diners. Past the whispers. Past the shame. She stumbled after him, her legs refusing to cooperate, her whole world tilted at a horrifying, sickening angle from which it felt it would never recover. The solid ground was gone, and she had a terrible, sinking feeling that she would never find it again.Mr. Henderson’s office was a small, windowless box tucked away behind the pot-wash station. It smelled of bleach and old invoices. He shoved her inside and slammed the door, the sound cutting off the restaurant noise and leaving them in a ringing, clinical silence. For a dizzying moment, Josie felt a wave of profound relief. No glass. No view. Just four solid, magnolia-painted walls, a cluttered desk, and a filing cabinet. She sagged against the door, the wood cool and blessedly opaque against her back, her body still vibrating with a terrifying internal hum.

“What in the name of God was that?” Henderson didn't shout. He was a master of the quiet, seething fury that was somehow much worse. He began to pace the tiny space, two steps one way, two steps back, like a caged animal. “Two broken glasses. A £200 bottle of gin wasted. A two-top of our most valued, highest-spending regulars scared out of their wits. The entire restaurant gawping. Explain to me, Josephine, how any of that falls under the job description of a senior waitress.” He stopped and pinned her with a stare. “Are you drunk? Are you on drugs? Don’t lie to me.”

“No.” The word was a dry rasp. She couldn’t look at him, focusing instead on a stain on the carpet that looked vaguely like the shape of Ireland. “No, Mr. Henderson, I swear. I… I just felt a bit faint. I tripped.” The lie was pathetic, a flimsy shield against an avalanche. It explained nothing. It didn't explain why her hands were still tingling with the phantom sensation of the fall, or why the solid floor of this tiny office still felt like a thin crust over a vast, terrifying emptiness.

He let out a short, sharp laugh devoid of all humour. “Faint? You tripped? You looked like you’d seen a ghost. You stood there, frozen solid, for a full thirty seconds while Tasha had to clean up your mess around your feet. People don't just 'trip' like that.” He leaned over his desk, his knuckles white as he gripped its edge. “This is my reputation you’re playing with. People come here for an experience. Seamless. Perfect. They don’t pay three hundred pounds for dinner and a show starring a waitress having a nervous breakdown.”

The words hit her like a slap. A nervous breakdown. Was that what it was? The thought was so stark, so clinical, it almost cut through the fog of terror. She finally met his gaze, her own eyes wide with a desperate, silent plea. She wanted to explain, to tell him about the thrumming, the tilting floor, the dreams, the glass that wasn't there. But the words wouldn't form. They were trapped behind the lump in her throat, strangled by the certainty that he would think she was completely insane. “I’m sorry,” was all she could manage, a useless, hollow whisper.

“Sorry doesn’t cut it.” He straightened up, his face set like concrete. The decision had been made. “I can’t have this instability on my floor. It’s a liability. Go to the staff room, get your things. Tasha will settle up your wages for the week from the petty cash. I suggest you take some time and… sort yourself out.” It was a dismissal, not a diagnosis. A severance, not a solution. He was simply excising the faulty part to ensure the machine kept running smoothly.

The walk back through the staff corridor felt impossibly long. The clatter from the kitchen, usually a familiar comfort, now sounded accusatory. She could feel the stares of the kitchen porters, the commis chefs, all of whom would have heard the crash and seen the commotion. In the cramped, humid locker room, she peeled off the black uniform, folding it with a strange, numb reverence before shoving it into her tote bag. It felt like shedding a skin. Tasha was waiting by the lockers, holding a small, crumpled envelope of cash. Her usual sharp, cynical expression was softened with something that looked unnervingly like pity.

“He actually fired you?” Tasha asked, her voice low.

Josie just nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She took the envelope.

“To be honest, pet, I’m not surprised,” Tasha continued, leaning against the bank of lockers. “You’ve been weird for weeks. Jumpy. Always trying to avoid the window tables. I just thought you were being lazy, but… this is something else, isn’t it?” She paused, looking at Josie properly for the first time all night. “Whatever it is, this place wasn't going to help. Being up here all the time… it’s not natural, is it?”

Josie finally looked up, and in Tasha’s usually guarded eyes, she saw a flicker of understanding. It was a tiny kindness, but it was enough to make her own eyes sting with tears. “I’ve got to go,” she choked out, turning and fleeing before she completely fell apart.

The ride down in the service lift was an agony of slow, measured descent. She watched the floor numbers change above the door—21, 20, 19—each one a marker on her journey back to earth. The smooth, weightless drop was a horrifying echo of the plunge she had imagined, a controlled fall that did nothing to calm the chaos in her mind. She stared at her own scuffed shoes, pressing her feet hard against the floor, willing it to stay solid beneath her.

The lift doors slid open into the service bay on the ground floor, and she pushed her way out into the cool, damp night air of the quayside. The sudden feeling of solid, unmoving pavement under her feet was so profound it made her knees weak. She staggered a few steps away from the building’s entrance, gulping in the air, thick with the smell of the river and rain on tarmac. After a moment, she turned and looked up. The Glasshouse soared into the night sky, a pillar of glittering light, its inhabitants oblivious, floating in their warm, golden world. It looked alien, menacing. A beautiful, transparent prison she had just been expelled from. The relief of being on the ground was immense, but it was tangled with the cold, hard dread of unemployment, and the terrifying, sinking certainty that even though she was out of the tower, she had taken the fall with her.The walk home was a pilgrimage back to the horizontal world. She kept to the cobbled paths of the quayside, her sensible flats making soft, apologetic sounds on the damp stones. She refused to look up at the glittering tower she had just left, or at the other, older buildings that lined the river. Instead, she watched her own feet, marvelling at the simple, mechanical act of placing one in front of the other on solid, unmoving ground. The air, which in the restaurant had been a recycled, scent-engineered commodity, was now raw and real. It smelled of cold river water, diesel fumes from a passing bus, and the faint, greasy promise of chips from a distant takeaway. It was the smell of the city from the inside out, not the sanitised version she had been serving up to tourists. The relief was a physical presence, a weight settling back onto her shoulders, pinning her gratefully to the earth.

Her route took her towards the Millennium Bridge. In her previous life, an hour ago, it had been a key selling point, a graceful, kinetic sculpture she could describe with practiced ease. From the twenty-second floor, its famous tilting mechanism looked like a slow, languid wink. From ground level, it was a different beast entirely. An arch of white steel looming out of the darkness, its skeletal structure stark against the bruised purple sky. The pedestrian deck, a gentle curve over the black water, seemed to hang in the air with a terrifying lack of support. To get home, she had to cross it. She paused at its entrance, the envelope of cash in her pocket feeling thin and useless. The low hum she had felt in the restaurant was back, a ghost in her bloodstream, a deep thrum that seemed to emanate not from the bridge, but from the chasm it spanned.

She forced herself to take the first step onto the metal walkway. Her hand immediately found the cold, thick steel of the handrail, her knuckles turning white as she gripped it. The deck was a metal grid, and through the tiny gaps, she could see the churning, light-dappled surface of the Tyne below. It was like walking on a sieve. The dark water seemed to pull at her, a magnetic, dizzying draw. The floor, her old enemy, was no longer pretending to be solid. It was openly, honestly, terrifyingly absent. Her heart began to beat a frantic, panicked rhythm against her ribs. The elegant curve of the bridge now felt like a high wire, and she was a clumsy amateur forced to cross it in a high wind. A group of students, loud and drunk and full of life, jostled past her, their laughter echoing in the cavernous space under the arch. They didn't even seem to notice they were suspended over a dark, cold void.

Focusing on the far bank, on the reassuringly solid buildings of Gateshead, she began to move. It was a strange, shuffling gait, her feet barely leaving the ground as if she were testing the surface with every step. She kept her eyes fixed forward, a desperate tunnel vision that blocked out the peripheral horror of the drop. She could feel the faint vibration of the bridge under her feet, the subtle sway engineered into its design, and every tiny movement sent a fresh spike of adrenaline through her system. The journey was only a few hundred metres, a walk she had done a thousand times without a second thought, but tonight it felt like an epic, life-or-death crossing. By the time her feet touched the solid concrete of the far side, she was gasping for air, her forehead slick with a cold sweat. She stumbled away from the bridge’s exit, not daring to look back, the feeling of having narrowly escaped a great danger leaving her weak and trembling.

Her mam’s house was a small, brick-faced terrace in a street where the sodium orange of the lamps gave everything a warm, nostalgic glow. It was the absolute antithesis of The Glasshouse. It was low to the ground, solid, dependable. Its windows were small, dressed in net curtains, and promised nothing more than a view of the street outside. Josie fumbled with her keys, her hands still shaking, and let herself into the narrow hallway. It smelled of her mam’s fabric softener and the Sunday roast that was still faintly ghosting the air two days later. It was the smell of safety.

“Is that you, our Josie?” Sharon’s voice called from the living room, muffled by the television. “You’re back early. Did Henderson’s head finally explode?”

Josie closed the door behind her, the solid thud of the lock sliding into place a deeply comforting sound. She walked into the living room, a cosy, cluttered space dominated by a large, floral-patterned sofa and a television flickering with the colours of a quiz show. Sharon was sitting in her usual armchair, a half-finished mug of tea on the coaster beside her. She took one look at Josie’s face, pale and drawn under the warm light of the lamp, and her smile faltered. She muted the television with the remote. “Pet? What’s happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Josie opened her mouth to speak, to construct some palatable version of the truth, but the effort was too much. The carefully constructed dam of her composure, which had survived the firing and the terrifying walk home, finally broke. A ragged sob escaped her, and then another. She sank onto the sofa, her tote bag dropping to the floor, and buried her face in her hands. The shame, the fear, the bone-deep certainty that something was profoundly wrong with her, all came pouring out in a flood of silent, wrenching tears.

Sharon was beside her in an instant, her arms wrapping around Josie’s shaking shoulders. She didn’t press for answers. She just held her, rubbing her back in slow, steady circles, the way she had when Josie was a child who’d fallen and scraped her knee. "Shhh, now. It's alright, love. Whatever it is, you're home now," she murmured, her voice a low, steady anchor in the swirling chaos of Josie’s mind. "You're safe. You're on the ground." And in the warm, solid embrace of her mother, surrounded by the familiar clutter of her childhood home, Josie finally allowed herself to feel the full, terrifying depth of her fall.The torrent of tears eventually slowed to a trickle, leaving Josie hollowed out and exhausted, her cheek pressed against the reassuringly non-designer floral pattern of her mam’s cardigan. Sharon just kept holding her, her presence a solid, unmoving anchor. She smelled of tea and laundry soap, the antithesis of the rarefied air of The Glasshouse. Here, on this lumpy sofa, there was no illusion of floating; there was just the grounding weight of another person’s love, holding her down.

“Right then,” Sharon said softly, finally pulling back to look at Josie’s blotchy, tear-streaked face. She smoothed a stray piece of hair from Josie’s forehead with a work-roughened thumb. “Let’s get the kettle on, and you can tell me what’s brought all this on. And I want the proper story, mind. Not the one you think I want to hear.”

In the small, warm kitchen, cradling a mug of sweet, milky tea that scalded her raw throat, Josie tried to explain. The words came out jumbled, nonsensical even to her own ears. She started with the firing, the solid, verifiable fact of it. But that wasn’t the real story. “He sacked me for dropping some glasses,” she mumbled into her mug, but even as she said it, she knew it was a lie of omission. She took a shaky breath. “Mam… something’s wrong with me. When I’m up there… the building, it feels like it’s breathing. The floor, it… it goes soft. Like it’s not there. Tonight, I looked down and… it was all gone. Everything. Just the drop.” She looked up, her eyes wide with the remembered terror, fully expecting to see disbelief or even fear in her mother’s face.

But Sharon just listened, her brow furrowed in concentration. She refilled Josie’s mug from the teapot, her movements calm and deliberate. “It’s that bloody building,” she said, her voice firm, assigning blame to the concrete and glass structure as if it were a living villain. “It’s not right, being cooped up that high all day and night, like a battery hen in a glass box. All that pressure, from Henderson and from the customers, and you’re expected to float about on a cloud. It’s no wonder your nerves are shot to pieces, pet. You’re exhausted. Your body’s just found a funny way of telling you.”

The simple, external diagnosis was so profoundly comforting that Josie felt a fresh wave of tears well up. Her mam wasn't calling her mad. She was calling her tired. They talked for another hour, Sharon steering the conversation towards practicalities. She declared Josie was having the rest of the week off, “doctor’s orders,” with her being the doctor. She talked about the stress of the job, the long hours, the snooty customers. She systematically dismantled the glamour of The Glasshouse, reducing it to what it was: a stressful, precarious workplace that had worn her daughter down to a nub. She never once questioned the tilting floors or the breathing walls, accepting them as symptoms of a deeper, more understandable exhaustion.

Josie woke the next morning in her childhood bedroom, the pale grey light of a Tyneside dawn filtering through the thin curtains. For a confused moment, her body tensed, her mind already preparing for the uniform, the commute, the ascent into the sky. Then she remembered. She was fired. She was on the ground. She lay still, listening to the house. There was no hum. No vibration in her bones. There was just the gentle creak of the floorboards as her mam moved about downstairs and the distant rumble of the first bus of the day. The view from her window was of the slate roof opposite and a tangle of television aerials. It was mundane, limited, and the most beautiful sight she had ever seen. She felt a profound, bone-deep sense of safety, but it was fragile, edged with the unnerving silence of a future she hadn't planned for.

She spent the day as a willing captive. The house, which she usually only used for sleeping, became her entire world. She watched daytime television, mesmerised by the flat, unthreatening reality of it. She helped her mam peel vegetables for tea, the simple, repetitive task a balm for her frayed nerves. She found herself mapping the house in the same way she had the restaurant, but this time it wasn’t a choreography of avoidance, but one of appreciation. The solid thud of the fridge door, the slight warp in the hallway floor that had been there for twenty years, the reassuring weight of the walls. Every time a flicker of the memory of the fall threatened to surface, she would press her hand against a wall, feeling the lath and plaster, the solid, dependable stuff of home.

Sharon returned from her afternoon cleaning job at a solicitor's office with a copy of the local paper, which she placed on the kitchen table with a gentle thud. "Just for a look, pet," she said, pre-empting any protest. "No harm in seeing what's out there." Josie stared at the 'Situations Vacant' section. Barista at Costa, bar staff at The Bodega, waitress at a little Italian place down by the Bigg Market. All ground-floor jobs. All places where the biggest drop was a single step down into the cellar. A year ago, she would have seen it as a colossal step backwards. She had been proud of her job at The Glasshouse, of mastering the intricate ballet of high-end service, of inhabiting that exclusive, rarefied world. Now, the thought of serving frothy coffees on a solid pavement felt like a lifeline, a return to a world that obeyed the laws of physics.

Later that evening, as they sat in the quiet companionship of the living room, the television murmuring in the background, Sharon put down her knitting. "I've been thinking," she said, her voice casual, but her eyes serious. "This feeling faint and all that… maybe you should just pop and see Dr. Evans. Get your bloods checked. Might be you’re a bit anaemic or something. For my peace of mind, eh?" She was offering Josie another easy, physical explanation for her terror, a medical get-out-clause that didn't involve admitting her mind had betrayed her. Josie looked from her mam's worried face to the window, where the night was held at bay by a thick brick wall. Explaining the vibrating sky-scraper to a GP seemed mortifying, impossible. But the alternative, the thought of the floor ever falling away from her again, was infinitely worse. She gave a slow, tired nod. "Alright, Mam," she whispered. "I'll make an appointment in the morning."Chapter 2

The doctor’s surgery waiting room was a study in beige. The chairs were upholstered in a hard-wearing, vaguely sticky vinyl, the walls were the colour of weak tea, and the air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and stale breath. A television, muted on the wall, showed a panel of celebrities arguing about something trivial, their animated faces a silent, frantic pantomime. Josie sat hunched on her chair, twisting the strap of her bag, feeling a hundred times more conspicuous here than she ever had carrying a tray of flaming sambucas through a packed restaurant. Here, everyone was nursing a secret ailment, a hidden pain, but hers felt shameful, a flaw in her very architecture. She was a building with faulty wiring, a car with a cracked chassis. She wasn't sick; she was broken.

Dr. Evans was a woman whose brisk, no-nonsense manner was at odds with her kind, tired eyes. Her office was cluttered with medical textbooks and stacks of patient files, a world away from the minimalist tyranny of Mr. Henderson’s stark white box. Josie sat on the edge of the patient chair, her feet planted firmly on the linoleum floor, and recited the script she and her mam had rehearsed. She’d been feeling faint, dizzy, tired. She thought she might be anaemic. Dr. Evans listened, tapping notes onto her keyboard, her expression unreadable.

“And when do these dizzy spells happen, Josephine?” she asked, her eyes not leaving the screen. “Any particular time of day? When you stand up too quickly?”

“At work, mostly,” Josie mumbled, staring at a colourful chart of the human circulatory system on the wall. It was all so contained, so neat. All the veins and arteries knew their place. “When I… when I was looking down.” The confession felt huge, a crack appearing in her carefully constructed facade.

Dr. Evans stopped typing. She swivelled in her chair to face Josie properly, her gaze direct but not unkind. “You worked at The Glasshouse, didn't you? My husband and I went for our anniversary last year. The views are… significant.” She chose her word carefully. “Tell me more about the dizziness. Is it like the room is spinning, or more like you’re unsteady on your feet?”

The question was a key, unlocking a door Josie had been trying to keep bolted. The carefully constructed lie crumbled. “It’s like the floor isn’t there,” she whispered, the words tasting of ash. “Like it’s tipping. I know it’s solid. I know it is. But it doesn’t feel it. I feel… I feel like I’m going to fall right through it.” She didn’t dare mention the breathing building; that was a step too far into madness. But the core of the terror was out, laid bare on the worn carpet between them. She braced herself for disbelief, for a condescending smile or a gentle suggestion that she was over-stressed.

Instead, Dr. Evans simply nodded, as if Josie had just described the common symptoms of a head cold. “It sounds like you’ve been experiencing severe panic attacks, triggered by a specific phobia. Acrophobia—fear of heights. But it can manifest in complex ways. The feeling of instability, the physical sensations, the certainty of impending doom… they are all classic hallmarks of a panic attack. Your body is going into fight-or-flight mode, but the threat it’s perceiving isn’t a tiger in the bushes, it’s the twenty-two-storey drop.” She said it so calmly, so clinically. The formless, all-consuming horror that had dismantled Josie’s life now had a name. It had a paragraph in a medical textbook. It wasn't a curse, or a sign she was losing her mind. It was a condition.

The relief was so immense it felt like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. A diagnosis. A label. It was a horrible, frightening label, but it was a label nonetheless. Dr. Evans explained more. She talked about the cycle of anxiety, how the fear of having a panic attack can become a trigger in itself. She took Josie’s blood pressure, which was slightly elevated. She agreed to do the blood tests for anaemia, “just to rule everything out,” a small concession to Sharon’s theory. Then, she scribbled on a prescription pad and tore off the sheet. “These are beta-blockers. They won’t stop the thoughts, but they can help control the physical response—the racing heart, the shaking. It might give you some breathing room.” She also handed Josie a leaflet, its paper crisp and official. It was for a local talking-therapies service. “I think it would be very beneficial for you to talk to someone, Josephine. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy can be very effective for phobias and panic disorder.”

Josie left the surgery in a daze, the prescription in one hand and the leaflet in the other. Panic disorder. The words echoed in her head. She walked, not towards home, but towards the city centre, moving through the lunchtime crowds with a new, strange awareness. She was a person with a panic disorder. The crowds, the noise of the traffic, the solid, grubby pavement beneath her feet—it all felt hyper-real. She found herself on a busy street near the Bigg Market and stopped. Across the road was a small, unassuming restaurant with a faded green awning: ‘Trattoria da Luigi’. It was one of the places from the paper. Through the window, she could see a handful of diners at tables covered in red-and-white checked cloths. It was defiantly, resolutely on the ground floor. Before the fear could talk her out of it, she crossed the road and pushed open the door, a small bell tinkling brightly above her head.

The air inside was warm and smelled richly of garlic, tomatoes, and baking bread. A short, barrel-chested man with a kind, crinkled face and a dusting of flour on his black apron looked up from behind the counter. “Can I help you, signorina?” He had a thick, melodic Italian accent. This was the antithesis of Mr. Henderson. There was no pinched expression, no aura of icy disdain.

“I… I saw your advert in the paper,” Josie stammered, feeling like a teenager asking for her first job. “You’re looking for a waitress?”

The man, presumably Luigi himself, beamed. “Ah, si! My last girl, she run off to be a singer in Ibiza. Good for her, bad for me.” He wiped his hands on his apron and looked her up and down. “You have experience?”

“Yes,” Josie said, her voice gaining a sliver of its old professional confidence. “I was a senior waitress at The Glasshouse for three years.”

Luigi’s eyebrows shot up. He was clearly impressed, but also suspicious. “The Glasshouse! Molto chic. Very fancy. Why you want to leave a place like that to come work for old Luigi? My tips, they are not Chablis tips.”

Josie met his gaze. The truth, or a version of it, felt strangely easy to tell this man. “I was looking for a change of pace,” she said, the words hanging in the air with a profound, unspoken weight. “Something a bit more… down to earth.”

Luigi chuckled, a deep, rumbling sound. He seemed to understand more than she had said. “Ah, down to earth! Is good. Here, is very down to earth. Sometimes the cellar floods.” He grinned. “You know the good wine from the bad? You can carry three plates?” Josie nodded. “Okay. You come back Friday, seven o’clock. We do a trial shift. If you are good, the job is yours. If you are no good,” he shrugged with theatrical helplessness, “you get a free bowl of pasta for your trouble. Deal?”

She walked out of the trattoria and into the bright afternoon, a grin spreading across her face. It felt insane. A trial shift in a tiny Italian restaurant that might get a flooded cellar. The pay would be a fraction of what she was used to. But it was a job. A solid, ground-floor job where the only thing floating was the parmesan on the minestrone. On her way to the bus stop, she paused, her gaze drawn unwillingly upwards towards the distant, glittering spire of The Glasshouse. It stood remote and silent against the pale blue sky. The familiar cold dread uncoiled in her stomach, a conditioned response. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t a nameless, shapeless abyss. It was a panic disorder. It was acrophobia. And as she clutched the doctor’s leaflet in her pocket, she knew that for the first time since the floor had fallen away, she wasn’t just falling. She was finally, maybe, starting to climb back up.Chapter 3

Friday arrived with a nervous, fluttering energy. Josie laid out her work clothes – simple black trousers and a plain black t-shirt, a world away from the tailored uniform of her past life. On her bedside table sat the small, white plastic bottle from the pharmacy. The label read ‘Propranolol’, a word that felt alien and clinical. She stared at it for a long time. It felt like an admission of failure, a chemical crutch for a mind that could no longer be trusted. Her mam’s voice echoed in her head, “It’s just to get you over the hump, pet. Like taking a paracetamol for a headache.” With trembling fingers, she shook one of the small, white pills into her palm and swallowed it with a glass of water, an act of faith in Dr. Evans and an act of defiance against the fear. She didn’t feel any different, not at first. But as she walked towards the bus stop, she noticed the usual background hum of anxiety, the constant, low-level vigilance for tilting pavements and yawning gaps, was muted. It was still there, a whisper in a distant room, but it was no longer screaming in her ear.

Stepping into Trattoria da Luigi that evening was like diving into a warm, noisy sea. The air, thick with the scent of simmering garlic and oregano, was a stark contrast to the filtered, perfume-scented atmosphere of The Glasshouse. A boisterous argument in a mix of Italian and Geordie erupted from the kitchen, punctuated by the clang of a dropped pan, followed by a roar of laughter. Luigi saw her and bustled over, wiping his hands on an apron already Jackson Pollocked with tomato sauce. He clapped a floury hand on her shoulder. “Ah, Josie! Benvenuta! Welcome! You are ready to work, eh?” He didn't wait for an answer, simply steering her towards the kitchen pass-through where a mountain of garlic bread was waiting to go out. There was no formal induction, no lecture on brand identity. There was just the immediate, pressing reality of hungry people and hot food.

The next three hours were a blur of controlled chaos. The muscle memory from her years of waitressing took over, a familiar dance of taking orders, clearing plates, and refilling glasses. But the steps were different. The plates were heavy, earthenware dishes piled high with steaming pasta, threatening not to shatter but to simply strain your wrist. The wine was house red or house white, poured from large, glugging carafes, not ceremoniously presented in a silver bucket. The clientele was a chaotic mix of families arguing over the last slice of pizza, students on cheap dates, and elderly couples who had clearly been coming here for decades. The noise level was immense, a constant, cheerful din of conversation, laughter, and cutlery scraping against plates. It was the sound of life, messy and uncurbed, and it drowned out the silence in which her fears had always thrived.

Luigi sent her to the cellar to fetch another case of Peroni. “Attenta, the steps are steep!” he called after her. The door opened onto a flight of worn, wooden stairs that descended into a dimly lit, damp-smelling space. It was a moment Josie had been dreading. The precipice. The drop. Her breath hitched, and she felt the familiar, sickening lurch in her stomach, the first tremor of a full-blown panic. Her hand shot out to grip the rough wooden handrail. But the violent, physical cascade she expected didn't come. Her heart hammered, but it wasn't the wild, chest-bursting panic of The Glasshouse. The beta-blocker seemed to be acting as a dam, holding back the flood of adrenaline. It was just a fast heartbeat. She took a breath, the cool, earthy smell of the cellar filling her lungs. She looked down. It was just a set of stairs leading to a concrete floor stacked with boxes. It wasn't a chasm. With her knuckles white on the rail, she took one deliberate step, then another, until her feet were firmly on the solid floor below. The victory, small and unseen by anyone but her, was monumental.

As the evening rush subsided, a young couple at table five called her over. They looked barely out of their teens, flushed with the excitement of a first date. The boy, fumbling with his wallet, asked anxiously if they had enough to leave a tip. Josie looked at them, remembering the fat wallets and casual, thousand-pound evenings of her old life. She saw their earnest, worried faces and smiled, a genuine, unforced smile that reached her eyes. “Don’t you worry about it,” she said softly. “You just have a lovely night.” They left, holding hands, their gratitude more potent than any 20% gratuity she had ever received. It was a different kind of currency, one that didn't rely on altitude and illusion. It was grounded in simple, human connection.

At the end of the night, as Josie wiped down the last of the sticky, checked tablecloths, Luigi emerged from the kitchen, a small glass of amber liquid in each hand. He passed one to her. “Limoncello. For a job well done.” The liquid was sweet, sharp, and fiery, a shocking contrast to the subtle complexities of Chablis. “So, Signorina Glasshouse,” he said, leaning against the counter, his face tired but content. “You are fast. You don't break anything. And you smile like you mean it. The job is yours, if you still want to work in my noisy, messy little place.” He pulled a crumpled fifty-pound note from his pocket and pressed it into her hand. "For your troubles."

The walk home through the quiet city was different. Her feet ached, a deep, physical ache that was almost pleasurable. Her clothes smelled faintly of garlic. The fifty pounds in her pocket felt earned, solid. She passed the entrance to the Millennium Bridge and paused. She didn’t try to cross it, not yet. But she looked at it, the great white arch clean against the dark sky, the walkway suspended over the black, silent Tyne. The fear was still there, a cold presence at the edge of her thoughts. But it no longer felt like a part of her. It felt like something separate, a challenge to be met another day. This was not the end of the war, but it was the first battle she had truly won.

Back in the quiet of her bedroom, she sat on the edge of her bed and pulled the crumpled therapy leaflet from her bag. She smoothed it out on her knee. The job was a start. It was a place to stand, a solid foundation beneath her feet. It proved she could still function, still work, still exist in the world without floating away. But the leaflet represented the real work ahead: not just avoiding the heights, but understanding why she had fallen in the first place. She looked at the phone number, then at the alarm clock on her bedside table. It was late, but not too late. With a deep breath that tasted of limoncello and newfound resolve, she picked up her mobile phone. She had survived the fall. Now, it was time to learn how to climb.The number, printed on the smooth, slightly glossy paper of the leaflet, seemed to stare up at her. It was just ten digits, an anonymous gateway to a world she knew nothing about. For a long, silent moment, she just looked at it, the limoncello-and-Propranolol-induced calm of the evening beginning to fray at the edges. Making the call would be an admission. It would take the formless, private terror that lived inside her head and give it a name, a file number, an appointment time. It would make it real, a concrete problem to be solved rather than a nightmare to be survived. She thought of Tasha's furious, embarrassed face, of Mr. Henderson's quiet, surgical dismissal, of the dizzying, nauseating plunge over the edge of the world. With a shuddering breath that was half-sob, half-resolve, she tapped the numbers into her phone and pressed the call button before she could lose her nerve.

The voice that answered was not what she expected. It wasn't clinical or condescending; it was just a tired-sounding woman with a gentle Geordie accent, the kind of voice you’d hear asking for two sugars at a tea counter. Josie stumbled through her explanation, using the safe, pre-approved words Dr. Evans had given her. "I've been having panic attacks... a phobia... heights." The woman on the other end just hummed in a placid, understanding way. "Aye, we get a lot of that, pet. It's more common than you think," she said, her casual acceptance a balm on Josie’s raw shame. An appointment was made for an initial assessment the following Wednesday. When Josie hung up, the silence of her bedroom rushed back in, but it felt different. It was no longer empty, but expectant. She had rung the bell, and now she had to wait for someone to answer the door.

The next week at Trattoria da Luigi was a noisy, garlicky, grounding respite. Josie found a simple, profound satisfaction in the physicality of the work. The weight of the plates was real. The heat from the pizza oven was real. The cacophony of the diners and the rapid-fire Italian from the kitchen was a constant, distracting roar that left little room for the treacherous whispers in her own mind. She learned the names of the regulars: Mr. and Mrs. Davies who always shared a tiramisu, the table of lads from the local garage who came in every Friday for pizza and beer. She learned Luigi’s rhythms, the subtle shift in his tone that meant the carbonara was ready, the way he would hum off-key when he was happy with a batch of dough. She was part of a machine again, but this one was powered by yeast and human chatter, not by illusion and anxiety. It was held together by tradition, not by tension cables.

The building that housed the Northern Mind & Wellbeing Centre was a large, red-brick Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street a few bus stops from the city centre. It was the architectural opposite of The Glasshouse: solid, ornate, and rooted deep in the Tyneside soil. Its windows were tall, sash-paned affairs that looked out onto a small, slightly overgrown garden. Josie pushed open the heavy oak door and stepped into a hallway that smelled of old wood and furniture polish. There was no vertigo here, only the comforting creak of floorboards that had held the weight of people for over a hundred years.

Her therapist was a woman named Sarah, who had a calm face and wore a brightly coloured scarf that seemed at odds with the serious nature of the business. Her office wasn't a clinical box but a comfortable room, with two slightly mismatched armchairs and a large, healthy-looking cheese plant in the corner. After the initial pleasantries, a chasm of silence opened up. Josie sat on the edge of her armchair, her hands clenched in her lap, not knowing where to begin. "I lost my job," she started, the words feeling small and inadequate.

Sarah just nodded, her hands resting in her lap. “Okay. What happened?” Her voice was gentle, an invitation rather than a demand. So Josie told her. She described the restaurant, the view, the feeling of floating. Then, her voice dropping to a near-whisper, she tried to describe the fall. "It wasn't like being dizzy. It was... a certainty. The glass was gone. The floor was gone. I was standing on nothing, and I was about to drop. I could feel it. I can still feel it sometimes, even just thinking about it." She felt a hot blush of shame creep up her neck, her eyes fixed on the rug between them.

“That feeling of certainty is the panic attack’s most powerful weapon,” Sarah said, her tone matter-of-fact, not pitying. “It hijacks your brain's threat-detection system and convinces you, with absolute authority, that you are in mortal danger. Your brain can’t tell the difference between a perceived threat and a real one. The physical response is identical.” She went on to explain the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, describing it as a way of retraining the brain, of teaching it to distinguish between a faulty alarm and a genuine fire. "We do it in small steps," she said. "We build a ladder, and we only ever ask you to climb the first rung. We don't even look at the top."

Josie swallowed hard. "What's the first rung?"

Sarah’s expression was unreadable. "This week, I want you to go home and find a photo. A photo of a tall building, or a view from a high window. It could be a picture in a magazine, or one you find on the internet. And I want you to look at it. Just for thirty seconds. Then I want you to close the magazine or turn off the screen and walk away. That's it. That's the first rung." Josie stared at her. Look at a picture. It was so small, so simple, it felt absurd. And yet, the very thought of deliberately seeking out an image of the thing that terrified her sent a cold trickle of dread down her spine. It felt like being asked to hold a spider when you were an arachnophobe. It was a tiny thing, but it was the first step back into the world she had fallen from.Chapter 4

The task felt both laughably simple and monumentally impossible. For two days, Josie orbited the idea of it, cleaning the house with a frantic energy, alphabetising her mam’s spice rack, and volunteering to walk to the shops in the rain, anything to avoid sitting down at the laptop. The photograph was a sleeping dragon she was being asked to poke. She knew it was just pixels on a screen, a flat, harmless arrangement of light, but her panicked brain didn’t care about logic. It was preparing for a real predator, a real fall. The Propranolol helped keep the physical tidal wave of panic at bay, but it couldn't silence the insidious whisper that said, *Don’t look. If you look, it will become real. If you look, you will fall.* It was the thought of returning to Sarah’s office empty-handed, of admitting that even the first, tiniest rung of the ladder was too high, that finally propelled her into action. On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, while her mam was at work, she sat at the kitchen table, opened her old laptop, and took a deep, shaky breath.

She typed ‘Newcastle skyline at night’ into the search bar, her fingers stiff and clumsy. The screen bloomed with a hundred tiny windows, a hundred different drops. She recognised the view from The Glasshouse instantly, the specific angle of the Millennium Bridge’s arch, the way the lights of the Sage reflected in the dark water. Her stomach lurched. She felt a phantom vibration in her bones, the ghost of the building’s breath. Forcing herself to ignore the images from her old prison, her eyes scanned for something different, something less personal. She settled on a generic, professionally taken shot of the Tyne Bridge, its powerful green arch dominating the frame, the city lights scattered behind it like fallen stars. It was beautiful, detached, and terrifying. She clicked to enlarge it, filling the screen, and started counting. “One… two… three…”

The first ten seconds were a battle. Every instinct screamed at her to slam the laptop shut, to run from the room. Her mind, a treacherous artist, tried to give the image depth, to create the dizzying sensation of looking down. The tiny cars on the bridge seemed to move, the river seemed to ripple. She felt her palms grow damp. But she held on, her knuckles white where she gripped the edge of the table. She focused on the feeling of the solid chair beneath her, the cool linoleum under her feet. She wasn’t there. She was here, in her mam’s kitchen. She was safe. By twenty seconds, something shifted. The immediate, visceral terror began to recede, leaving behind a low-grade, manageable anxiety. Her brain, receiving no confirmation of an actual fall, seemed to grow bored of the alarm. The image flattened, becoming just a picture again. A pretty, static arrangement of light and colour. When she reached thirty, she released the breath she hadn’t realised she was holding and calmly closed the laptop. She sat in the silence, her heart beating a steady, normal rhythm. She had done it. She had looked into the abyss, and the abyss had blinked first.

That small, private victory seemed to recalibrate her world. At the Trattoria that week, she felt a new lightness in her step. The solid, noisy reality of the restaurant was no longer just a refuge; it was a place she was actively choosing, a world she was fighting to stay in. She bantered with Luigi, corrected the new kitchen porter’s terrible Italian pronunciation with a gentle laugh, and found herself anticipating the regulars’ orders before they even sat down. The work was demanding, her feet ached, and she once got a splash of hot bolognese sauce on her cheek, but it was all wonderfully, beautifully real. There were no illusions to maintain, no invisible barriers to polish. The only thing she had to sell was pasta and a genuine smile, and she found she had an abundance of both.

Her second appointment with Sarah felt different. Josie walked into the room not as a victim of her fear, but as a student ready to report on her homework. She explained how she’d looked at the picture, describing the initial wave of panic and the strange, quiet calm that followed. Sarah listened, her expression calm and encouraging, offering praise that felt more meaningful than any lavish tip. “That’s excellent, Josie. You challenged the thought, and you sat with the feeling until your brain learned that the alarm was false. You’ve just laid the first paving stone on the path back.” The validation was powerful, a confirmation that her struggle was not just in her head but was a real, conquerable challenge. Sarah leaned forward slightly. “So, are you ready for the next rung?” Josie nodded, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. “This week,” Sarah said, her voice even, “I want you to spend one minute looking out of a second-storey window.”

The instruction landed with a soft thud, far heavier than the request for a photograph. A window was a physical space, a tangible opening onto the world. A photograph was a memory of a drop; a window was a potential one. The thought immediately went to her own bedroom. The small sash window she had looked out of a million times, the window that offered a thrillingly boring view of Mrs. Henderson’s prize-winning petunias in the yard opposite and a patch of grey, often-rainy sky. It had always been a source of comfort, a frame for the mundane world. Now, Sarah had turned it into a new battleground.

That evening, after her shift, she stood in the centre of her bedroom, the familiar space feeling suddenly alien. The air was still and quiet, a stark contrast to the lively chaos of the restaurant. She looked at the window, at the way the streetlight cast a pale, watery rectangle of light onto the carpet. It was just a window. But her mind was already at work, calculating the distance to the ground, imagining the feeling of the sill under her hands, the sickening lurch of looking straight down onto the dark, wet paving stones of the back lane. She had won the battle with the photograph, a skirmish against a two-dimensional ghost. This felt different. This was the first test in the real world, the first step towards reclaiming the vertical dimension of her life. She took a deep breath, the air tasting of dust and determination, and slowly, deliberately, walked towards it.Her hand rested on the cool, painted wood of the windowsill. She kept her eyes fixed on her own knuckles, on the chipped nail polish from a dropped pan at the Trattoria, on anything but the glass itself. The window, a familiar friend she had leaned out of on hot summer nights and pressed her forehead against while watching winter snows, was now a charged object, a portal to the void she carried inside her. She could feel the familiar thrum begin, a low-frequency hum in her jaw and the soles of her feet. It was the phantom vibration of The Glasshouse, an echo of the terror that had become imprinted on her nervous system. *It's a faulty alarm,* she told herself, the words a silent, desperate chant. *The threat is not real. You are in your bedroom. The floor is solid. This is just a window.*

Slowly, she lifted her gaze. She didn't look down, not yet. She looked straight ahead, at the dark slate tiles of the roof across the back lane, glistening under the amber glow of the streetlights. She focused on the crooked television aerial, a familiar landmark in her personal geography. She started counting, her voice a barely audible whisper in the quiet room. "One, two, three..." The view seemed to shimmer at the edges, her brain trying to trick her, trying to liquefy the solid world. A wave of dizziness washed over her, a sickening sensation of the house tilting forward. She gripped the windowsill tighter, the sharp edge digging into her palms, anchoring her. The urge to flee, to recoil back into the safety of the room, was a physical force, a giant hand pushing against her chest. She fought it, picturing Sarah’s calm face, hearing her voice. *Sit with the feeling. Let it pass through you.* She held her ground, her body rigid with the effort, as the wave of panic crested and then, miraculously, began to recede.

She forced her eyes downwards. The back lane was a dark, narrow ribbon below. A stray cat darted across the wet paving stones, a fleeting shadow. From here, the drop was nothing, a height she had jumped from countless times as a child playing games in the street. But her fear didn't measure in feet and inches; it measured in potential, in the absolute horror of a fall. For a terrifying second, the ground seemed to rush up to meet her, the perspective shifting violently. She gasped, her breath catching in her throat. But she didn't close her eyes. She kept looking, forcing her brain to process the reality: the cat was gone, the bins were still there, the ground was staying put. She was still standing, her feet firm on her bedroom carpet. She was safe. The numbers kept coming, a steady, monotonous rhythm against the frantic beat of her own heart. “...fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty.”

She pulled back from the window as if breaking the surface of cold water, gasping in the air of the room. A tremor ran through her body, a violent shudder of adrenaline being released. She stumbled back and sat heavily on the edge of her bed, her legs weak and shaky. She had done it. She had stood on the edge of her own private cliff for a full minute and had not fallen. The exhaustion that washed over her was profound, as if she had run a marathon. But underneath the fatigue was a powerful, glowing ember of triumph. It was a victory no one else could see or understand, fought and won in the silent theatre of her own mind.

She sat there for a long time, just breathing, feeling the solid mattress beneath her and the steady thud of the floorboards. After a while, she stood up and walked back to the window. This time, there was no mission, no countdown. She just looked out. The view was the same – the wet roof, the crooked aerial, the dark lane. But the terror had been replaced by a quiet respect for the challenge she had overcome. She wasn't cured, she knew that. The thought of the Millennium Bridge, let alone the twenty-second floor of The Glasshouse, was still a distant, formidable mountain range she had yet to cross. But she had climbed the first hill. She had stood in the face of the fall and found her footing. And in the quiet of her small bedroom, with the mundane view of a Tyneside back lane spread out before her, Josie felt for the first time that she was no longer just a person who had fallen, but a person who was learning to stand up again.The following morning, Josie woke before her alarm. The usual knot of dread that greeted her consciousness was absent, replaced by a strange, quiet emptiness. She lay for a moment in the grey dawn, cataloguing her physical sensations. Her heart was beating at a slow, steady rhythm. The bones in her legs felt solid, connected to the mattress, which was in turn connected to the floorboards, the joists, the foundations, and the firm, unmoving earth. The feeling of safety was so profound it was almost a physical presence in the room. When she got out of bed, her feet met the floor with a sense of simple gratitude.

Downstairs, Sharon was already in the kitchen, a floral dressing gown tied around her waist, the radio murmuring a local news report. She was buttering toast with an efficiency that suggested she had been doing it for thirty years, which she had. She looked up as Josie entered, and her movements paused for a fraction of a second. A faint, worried line between her eyebrows smoothed out. “Well, look at you,” she said, her tone lighter than it had been in weeks. “You look like you’ve actually slept. I didn't hear you pacing about last night.”

“I did my homework,” Josie said, pouring herself a glass of water. The phrase sounded so absurdly mundane, so comically unequal to the Herculean effort of the night before. How could she explain that staring out of a window for sixty seconds had been the hardest exam of her life? She decided not to try. “It went okay.”

Sharon just nodded, placing a slice of toast on a plate for her. She didn’t push for details. She seemed to understand that this was a private, delicate process, and that her role was not to interrogate but to provide the solid ground on which Josie could conduct her strange, terrifying experiments. “Good,” she said simply. “Now, get some toast down you. You’re looking a bit less like a frightened ghost this morning. More like a tired waitress, which is a definite improvement.” The gentle, backhanded compliment was her mam’s highest form of praise, and Josie felt a warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the heating clicking on.

The sense of quiet accomplishment carried her through her next session with Sarah. She recounted the window experiment, not as a horror story, but as a data point, a successful trial. “The fear was there,” she explained, finding the words more easily now. “But it was like the volume was turned down. It was shouting at me, but from another room. I could hear it, but I didn't have to obey it.”

“That’s the goal, exactly,” Sarah said, a rare, genuine smile touching her lips. “You’re creating a space between the trigger and the response. In that space, you have a choice. You’re taking back control from the automatic, primitive part of your brain.” She leaned back in her armchair, her gaze steady. “You’ve successfully managed an exposure in a private, controlled environment. I think it’s time to take the next step. To take this skill outside.” Josie’s stomach tightened. She knew what was coming. The ladder was getting taller. “I want you to walk across the Millennium Bridge.”

The air in the room seemed to thin. Josie’s blood ran cold. The Millennium Bridge. The elegant white arch that had been a landmark she pointed out to tourists, then a terrifying high-wire she had shuffled across in a cold sweat, and now, a formal challenge. It was a monster she was being asked to face deliberately. “The whole way?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

“The whole way,” Sarah confirmed, her voice gentle but firm. “At your own pace. I want you to walk to the very middle, to the point where the arch is at its highest above you. And I want you to stop there. Just for one minute. Look around. Look at the view. Then, when the minute is up, you can walk to the other side. You can hold the handrail. You can count. You can do whatever you need to do. But the goal is to cross it.” She saw the stark fear in Josie’s eyes and leaned forward again. “Think about it, Josie. It’s a pedestrian bridge. It’s flat. It’s solid. Thousands of people cross it every day without a second thought. The structure is safe. The only thing you’ll be fighting is the feeling. And you’ve already proven you can do that.”

Josie left the session with the instruction echoing in her head, a heavy, terrifying command. She didn’t go straight home. Instead, she found herself walking along the quayside, her feet moving with a will of their own. She kept a safe distance, but there it was, spanning the Tyne like a colossal white bone. The sun was bright, and the bridge looked clean and beautiful, its graceful arch reflected in the water. From here, it looked harmless, a piece of civic art. But she knew that once she stepped onto its walkway, the world would change. The metal grid would become a flimsy net, the dark water a hungry mouth. The elegant structure would transform into a terrifying instrument of her phobia. She watched as tiny figures, ant-like from this distance, ambled across it, pausing to take photos, leaning on the rails. They were living in a different reality to her, a world where solid was solid and a bridge was just a way to get from one side to the other. She stood there for a long time, watching the monster in the sunlight, a cold, hard knot of dread and determination forming in her stomach. This was more than homework. This was a final exam.Chapter 5

The command lay on Josie’s mind like a smooth, heavy stone. For three days, she worked her shifts at the Trattoria, losing herself in the steam and clatter, her body moving through the familiar ballet of service while her thoughts circled warily around the Millennium Bridge. Every time a customer asked for a table with a view of the river, a jolt went through her, a tiny electric shock of reminder. The bridge was waiting. The challenge felt different from the others. The photograph and the bedroom window were private battles, fought within the safety of four walls. This was public. If she failed, if she froze or fled in a blind panic, she would be failing in front of the whole city. Her shame would be on display for the dog walkers, the tourists, and the joggers who used the bridge as their personal gym.

On the fourth day, a bright, windswept Saturday, she woke up with a grim sense of finality. Procrastination was a fertiliser for fear; the longer she left it, the bigger the monster in her head would grow. After a breakfast she barely tasted, she pulled on her sturdiest trainers, the sensible, ground-gripping shoes that felt like an extension of her own will to stay upright. She took a Propranolol with a steady hand, a pre-emptive strike against the physical mutiny she knew was coming. As she was about to leave, Sharon stopped her in the hallway, her hand on Josie’s arm. Her mam’s face was a mask of forced casualty, but her eyes were dark with worry. "Just going for a walk, are you, pet?" she asked.

Josie nodded, unable to meet her gaze. "Aye. Just down the quayside. For some air."

"Right then," Sharon said, her grip tightening for a second before letting go. "The kettle will be on when you get back." It was a simple statement, but it was laden with meaning. It was an anchor cast from the safety of home, a promise of solid ground to return to. It was all the permission and encouragement Josie needed.

The walk to the quayside was a journey into enemy territory. The city was bustling with weekend life, the sounds of traffic and chatter a normal, cheerful backdrop to the silent, frantic monologue in her head. As she rounded the corner by the law courts, the bridge came into full view. It was a stark white slash against the brilliant blue sky, its famous arch tilting slightly as if in greeting, or perhaps as a challenge. Today, it was the 'blinking eye' of her old tour-guide spiel, but the wink felt predatory. She stopped, her feet rooted to the pavement. The rational part of her brain, bolstered by therapy and medication, recited the facts: it was an award-winning piece of engineering, made of steel and concrete, tested for loads far greater than she could imagine. But the primitive, panicked part of her brain simply screamed: *VOID. DROP. FALL.*

Taking a breath that felt thin and inadequate, she started walking again, her eyes fixed on the entrance to the walkway. Her destination. As she got closer, the sounds of the city were replaced by the sounds of the river: the cry of gulls, the low thrum of a boat engine, the rush of the wind funnelling under the arch. She stepped onto the metal ramp, and her hand immediately shot out, her fingers wrapping around the thick, cold steel of the handrail in a death grip. The walkway was a metal grid, just as she remembered, a cruel, transparent floor that offered no comfort, no illusion of solidity. Through the diamond-shaped gaps, the Tyne churned below, a murky, hypnotic green. The sensation of being suspended, of having nothing but a few inches of engineered steel between her and the cold water, was instantaneous and overwhelming.

Her heart began to hammer against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. A wave of light-headedness washed over her. *This is it,* the panic whispered. *The faulty alarm. It’s just a feeling.* She forced her legs to move, her steps a stiff, robotic shuffle. She kept her eyes fixed on the deck a few feet in front of her, not daring to look left or right. She could feel the faint, almost imperceptible vibration of the bridge beneath her feet, the subtle sway designed to accommodate the wind, and every tiny movement sent a fresh spike of terror through her. She was a tightrope walker, and her own mind was the gale trying to throw her off balance. People ambled past her in the opposite direction, laughing, talking on their phones, utterly oblivious to the life-or-death struggle she was waging with every step.

She reached the midpoint, directly under the zenith of the great arch. This was the spot. This was the summit of her fear. She stopped, her knuckles white on the rail. Forcing herself to straighten up, she made herself let go of the handrail and put her hands on her hips, an absurd posture of defiance that felt like a lie. And then she made herself look. She looked towards the sea, at the distant, hazy horizon. She looked back at the city, at the old, steadfast bulk of the Tyne Bridge, and the castle keep standing guard on its hill. And then, her heart in her throat, she looked towards The Glasshouse. It glittered in the afternoon sun, a remote, impossibly tall shard of glass. It looked serene and beautiful from here, a silent tower that held no memory of her terror. It was just a building. Her prison, the source of all this pain, was just a place, and she was no longer in it.

She had to close her eyes as another dizzying wave of panic crested. The feeling of the bridge tipping was intense, a violent, physical certainty that she was about to be pitched over the side. She swayed, her hand flying back to the reassuring solidity of the rail. *Breathe,* she commanded herself. *Count.* She counted the gulls circling overhead. She counted the boats moored by the bank. She focused on the sound of the wind, the feeling of the sun on her face. The minute stretched into an eternity. The world was a vortex of terrifying sensation. But she did not run. She stood her ground, trembling, her eyes squeezed shut, clinging to the rail as if it were the only solid thing in a liquid universe. And then, slowly, achingly, the wave began to break. The violent tipping sensation subsided, leaving a queasy, shaky residue. Her heart rate, which had been a frantic gallop, slowed to a panicked canter. The alarm, having screamed itself hoarse and received no confirmation of disaster, was finally, grudgingly, falling silent.

She opened her eyes. The bridge was still. The river was still below her. The sky was still above her. She had not fallen. She had survived the very worst her mind could throw at her. A profound, bone-deep exhaustion washed over her, followed by a surge of pure, unadulterated triumph. She had done it. She had stood in the eye of her own personal hurricane and held fast. With a shaky, watery smile, she turned and began the second half of her journey. Her legs still felt like jelly, but her steps were different. They were the steps of a survivor, not a victim. The grid beneath her feet was still a grid, but the river below seemed less menacing, just a river on a Saturday afternoon.

When her feet finally touched the solid, unmoving concrete of the Gateshead side, a wave of relief so powerful it buckled her knees made her stumble to a nearby bench. She sat, her body shaking with the aftershocks of adrenaline, and just breathed, gulping in the solid, ground-level air. After a few minutes, she looked back. The Millennium Bridge spanned the water, graceful and serene. It was no longer a monster. It was just a bridge. A beautiful, clever bridge that she had just crossed. Pulling out her phone with a trembling hand, she found her mam’s number. She pressed call, and when Sharon answered, her voice tight with unspoken anxiety, Josie couldn't muster a full sentence. All she could manage to whisper, her voice thick with tears and relief, was a single, monumental phrase: “I did it, Mam. I’m on the other side.”The command lay on Josie’s mind like a smooth, heavy stone. For three days, she worked her shifts at the Trattoria, losing herself in the steam and clatter, her body moving through the familiar ballet of service while her thoughts circled warily around the Millennium Bridge. Every time a customer asked for a table with a view of the river, a jolt went through her, a tiny electric shock of reminder. The bridge was waiting. The challenge felt different from the others. The photograph and the bedroom window were private battles, fought within the safety of four walls. This was public. If she failed, if she froze or fled in a blind panic, she would be failing in front of the whole city. Her shame would be on display for the dog walkers, the tourists, and the joggers who used the bridge as their personal gym.

On the fourth day, a bright, windswept Saturday, she woke up with a grim sense of finality. Procrastination was a fertiliser for fear; the longer she left it, the bigger the monster in her head would grow. After a breakfast she barely tasted, she pulled on her sturdiest trainers, the sensible, ground-gripping shoes that felt like an extension of her own will to stay upright. She took a Propranolol with a steady hand, a pre-emptive strike against the physical mutiny she knew was coming. As she was about to leave, Sharon stopped her in the hallway, her hand on Josie’s arm. Her mam’s face was a mask of forced casualty, but her eyes were dark with worry. "Just going for a walk, are you, pet?" she asked.

Josie nodded, unable to meet her gaze. "Aye. Just down the quayside. For some air."

"Right then," Sharon said, her grip tightening for a second before letting go. "The kettle will be on when you get back." It was a simple statement, but it was laden with meaning. It was an anchor cast from the safety of home, a promise of solid ground to return to. It was all the permission and encouragement Josie needed.

The walk to the quayside was a journey into enemy territory. The city was bustling with weekend life, the sounds of traffic and chatter a normal, cheerful backdrop to the silent, frantic monologue in her head. As she rounded the corner by the law courts, the bridge came into full view. It was a stark white slash against the brilliant blue sky, its famous arch tilting slightly as if in greeting, or perhaps as a challenge. Today, it was the 'blinking eye' of her old tour-guide spiel, but the wink felt predatory. She stopped, her feet rooted to the pavement. The rational part of her brain, bolstered by therapy and medication, recited the facts: it was an award-winning piece of engineering, made of steel and concrete, tested for loads far greater than she could imagine. But the primitive, panicked part of her brain simply screamed: *VOID. DROP. FALL.*

Taking a breath that felt thin and inadequate, she started walking again, her eyes fixed on the entrance to the walkway. Her destination. As she got closer, the sounds of the city were replaced by the sounds of the river: the cry of gulls, the low thrum of a boat engine, the rush of the wind funnelling under the arch. She stepped onto the metal ramp, and her hand immediately shot out, her fingers wrapping around the thick, cold steel of the handrail in a death grip. The walkway was a metal grid, just as she remembered, a cruel, transparent floor that offered no comfort, no illusion of solidity. Through the diamond-shaped gaps, the Tyne churned below, a murky, hypnotic green. The sensation of being suspended, of having nothing but a few inches of engineered steel between her and the cold water, was instantaneous and overwhelming.

Her heart began to hammer against her ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. A wave of light-headedness washed over her. *This is it,* the panic whispered. *The faulty alarm. It’s just a feeling.* She forced her legs to move, her steps a stiff, robotic shuffle. She kept her eyes fixed on the deck a few feet in front of her, not daring to look left or right.

Pulling out her phone with a trembling hand, she found her mam’s number. She pressed call, and when Sharon answered, her voice tight with unspoken anxiety, Josie couldn't muster a full sentence. All she could manage to whisper, her voice thick with tears and relief, was a single, monumental phrase: “I did it, Mam. I’m on the other side.”There was a crackle on the line, then her mam’s voice, choked with an emotion Sharon rarely showed. “Oh, our Josie. I knew you could do it. I knew you could.” There was a pause, the sound of a sniffle hastily suppressed. “Right. That’s enough of that nonsense. Don’t you be getting a chill. Get yourself back over here, the long way round, mind. Go over the Swing Bridge. A nice, low, solid one. I’m putting the kettle on and there’s a slice of Battenberg with your name on it.” The line went dead. The call was over, the mission accomplished. The promise of tea and cake was the most comforting, grounding thing Josie had ever heard.

The walk back was a victory lap. She gave the Millennium Bridge a wide berth, heading instead for the low-slung, sturdy profile of the Swing Bridge. It sat squat on the water, a piece of old, cast-iron industrial muscle, painted a functional red and cream. It didn’t soar or glide; it hunkered down, rooted to the riverbed, its purpose utterly, reassuringly practical. As she walked across, the wooden planks under her feet offered a solid, satisfying thud with every step. She paused in the middle, leaning on the thick, riveted iron railing. Looking back, she saw the two bridges in profile: the elegant, skeletal arch of her former terror, and beyond it, the powerful green sweep of the Tyne Bridge. She saw the city not as a crumpled map, but as a living, breathing place of stone and steel and history. For the first time in months, she found a certain detached beauty in it, but this time the detachment wasn't from fear. It was from a sense of peace, of looking at a place she belonged to, from a safe and solid footing.

The reunion in the hallway was a brief, fierce hug. Sharon held her tight, her floral dressing gown smelling of safety and home, before pushing her away to arm’s length. “You look like you’ve been wrestling a bear,” she declared, though her eyes were shining. “Go on, get your shoes off. You’ve earned your sit down.” Over tea and unnaturally yellow cake, Josie recounted the story, the words flowing easily now. She described the fear, the shaking, the moment she thought she would break. Sharon listened, her head cocked, not with pity, but with a kind of fierce pride, as if her daughter had just returned from a war. And in a way, Josie felt she had. The battle had been silent, internal, and invisible to the rest of the world, but the victory was as real and as hard-won as any other.

At her next appointment, Sarah listened to the tale of the bridge with a quiet, professional satisfaction. “You met the fear head-on, Josie. You let the wave hit you, and you were still standing when it passed. That’s the core of it all. You’ve fundamentally retaught your brain that the alarm is false. You’ve done wonderfully.” Josie felt a warmth spread through her, the simple, powerful glow of earned praise. She felt strong, capable. But then Sarah leaned forward, her expression shifting slightly. “The ladder isn’t infinite, Josie. We’ve been climbing the rungs to get you back on solid ground. But there’s a final rung. The top of the ladder. And that’s the place where you fell.”

Josie’s blood ran cold. “The Glasshouse.” She whispered the name, the words tasting like ash. “You want me to go back up there?” The thought was a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs. All the old sensations, the tilting floor, the breathing walls, came rushing back into the quiet, safe therapy room. Sarah held up a hand. “No. I don’t want you to do anything. Not yet. But I want you to consider it. Not as an employee. Not to serve another bottle of Chablis. But as a customer. To go up there, on your own terms, have a coffee, look out of the window, and leave. To walk into the heart of your fear and prove to yourself that it has no power over you. To reclaim the space. It’s the final step, to show your brain, once and for all, that you are the one in control.” The idea was terrifying, unthinkable. And yet, a tiny, rebellious part of Josie’s mind recognised the truth in it. As long as the twenty-second floor remained a forbidden, haunted place, she would never be truly free.

A few weeks passed. Life settled into a new, comfortable rhythm. Josie thrived at the Trattoria. She knew the menu by heart, knew which tables wobbled, and knew that Luigi’s singing was a reliable indicator of the quality of that day’s batch of fresh pasta. The fear had receded, becoming a quiet, manageable hum in the background of her life, no longer the screaming static that had once consumed her. The thought of The Glasshouse remained, a distant, snow-capped mountain she was not yet ready to climb, but the sight of which no longer sent her running. One Thursday evening, during a lull between the early diners and the evening rush, she was polishing cutlery behind the bar, listening to Luigi complain about the price of parmesan. The little bell above the door tinkled. Josie looked up, a welcoming smile ready on her lips.

The smile froze. Standing in the doorway, her sharp, expensive coat a stark contrast to the homely décor, was Tasha. She looked different out of uniform, but her expression was the same: a mixture of impatience and faint, perpetual disappointment with her surroundings. She was with a man, and her eyes scanned the small, crowded restaurant with an undisguised air of disdain. And then her gaze fell on Josie. Tasha’s perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up in surprise, followed by a slow, cynical smirk. She swept towards the bar, her heels clicking an aggressive rhythm on the tiled floor, leaving her date hovering awkwardly by the door. She smelled of the same expensive perfume she used to wear at The Glasshouse, a scent that instantly transported Josie back to the twenty-second floor. “Well, well,” Tasha said, her voice dripping with condescending amusement. “Look what the cat dragged in. Trading seared scallops for spaghetti bolognese, are we, pet? Quite the step up in the world.” She leaned against the bar, her eyes flicking over Josie’s simple black uniform, a cruel, satisfied glint in her eyes. Josie stood frozen, a polishing cloth clutched in her hand, her heart giving a single, violent lurch, a terrifying echo of the fall.For a long, silent moment, the noisy, cheerful Trattoria seemed to fall away. The rich smell of garlic was replaced by the phantom scent of parsnip purée and expensive perfume. The warm, yellow light of the restaurant dimmed, and in her mind’s eye, Josie saw the glittering, twenty-second-floor view. Tasha’s words, sharp and perfectly aimed, were designed to humiliate, to remind Josie of her fall from grace, from the glittering heights to this noisy, garlic-scented backwater. The old Josie would have crumbled, her face flushing with shame, her voice catching in her throat. She would have stammered an apology or simply frozen, letting the wave of humiliation wash over her. She felt the familiar lurch, the cold dread coiling in her gut, the first tremor of the old panic.

But this was not the old Josie. The ground beneath her feet, the slightly sticky, wine-stained tiles of Luigi’s bar, was solid. She felt the weight of the polishing cloth in her hand, a real, tangible object. She heard the reassuring clang of a pan from the kitchen and the murmur of conversation from table three. These were the sounds of her new reality, a reality she had fought for. She had faced down the abyss on the Millennium Bridge; she would not be felled by a snide comment over a bowl of olives. She took a slow, deliberate breath, the air thick with the honest smell of cooking, and held Tasha’s gaze. The panic, which had surged forward, met a new, unyielding wall inside her and slowly, grudgingly, began to recede.

A small, genuine smile touched Josie’s lips. It was not the brittle, professional smile of The Glasshouse, but something softer, more authentic. “Aye, it’s a change,” she said, her voice even and calm, devoid of the shame Tasha had expected to find. “The tips aren’t as good, but the customers are happier and the floor stays where it’s supposed to.” She placed the polished fork she was holding into a container with a quiet, final clink. The statement was simple, direct, and utterly disarming. It offered no apology, no justification. It refused to engage with Tasha’s currency of status and snobbery. It was a declaration of contentment, a concept so alien to the world Tasha inhabited that it left her momentarily speechless.

Tasha’s smirk faltered, a flicker of confusion in her sharp eyes. She had come here expecting to find a broken, pathetic creature she could pity, and instead, she had found someone who seemed… happy. Before she could formulate a new line of attack, Luigi bustled out from behind the kitchen pass, wiping his floury hands on his apron. He beamed, his gaze taking in Tasha’s expensive coat and the nervous man lingering behind her. “Ah, a friend of our Josie!” he boomed, his voice a warm, enveloping wave that instantly changed the atmosphere. “Benvenuta! Welcome to my little place! Is not The Glasshouse, no? Here, the view is of the kitchen, but I promise you, the food is much better!” He winked at Josie, a silent, paternal gesture of solidarity, before turning his full, overwhelming charm on Tasha. “A table for two, eh? Come, come, I find you a nice one. You will have the spaghetti, it is my mother’s recipe. It will make you forget all about blinking bridges!”

He steered a bemused Tasha and her date towards a small table in the corner, his cheerful, booming voice effectively ending the confrontation and drawing a curtain across the scene. Josie watched them go, her heart still beating a little too fast, but the adrenaline was from a fight, not from a fall. She had stood her ground. She had not let the ghost of her past diminish the reality of her present. As Tasha sat down, shooting one last, unreadable look back at Josie, Josie simply turned back to her polishing, the repetitive, grounding motion a quiet celebration of her victory. The high-end dining establishment had met the community centre, and for the first time, Josie felt certain she was on the winning side.

Later that night, as she walked home through the quiet, rain-slicked streets, the encounter with Tasha played over in her mind. The initial sting of the insult had faded completely, replaced by a clear, cold sense of purpose. Tasha hadn't come to the Trattoria to wound her; Tasha had come to reassure herself. She had needed to see that Josie had fallen, to confirm that the world she, Tasha, still inhabited was the superior one. The flicker of confusion in her eyes when Josie had smiled was the most telling part. It was the look of someone who had peered into another world and been unsettled by what they saw. For the first time, Josie felt a sliver of something like pity for Tasha, trapped in her glass castle, forever polishing the invisible walls and selling the illusion.

Josie stopped at the foot of the High Level Bridge, looking out over the dark river at the city skyline. The Glasshouse was a pillar of light, a beacon of the life she had left behind. The final rung of Sarah's ladder. It was no longer a therapist’s assignment. It was a personal necessity. She had to go back, not to impress Tasha or to prove Mr. Henderson wrong, but for herself. She had to walk back into that space, feel the vibration in the floor, see the impossible view, and know, in her bones, that it was just a building. That the drop was outside, not in. That she could stand on the twenty-second floor and remain grounded. She pulled out her phone, the screen casting a pale light on her determined face. She didn't search for a crisis hotline or her mam's number. She opened the web browser, her fingers moving with a newfound confidence, and typed in the name of her old prison. She navigated to the bookings page, her heart beating a steady, defiant rhythm. Table for one. Next Tuesday. Seven o'clock. She didn't ask for a window seat. She knew she'd get one anyway.Chapter 7

The week leading up to the reservation was a strange limbo. A quiet hum of anticipation, a low-grade nervous energy, sat beneath the surface of her daily life. At the Trattoria, she chopped tomatoes and poured wine with her usual efficiency, but her mind was elsewhere, rehearsing the coming trial. She pictured the lift doors sliding open, the first glimpse of the view, the feel of the plush carpet under her feet. She ran through her coping strategies like a pilot running through a pre-flight checklist: deep breathing, cognitive reframing, grounding techniques. She was as prepared as she could be for a journey into the heart of her own personal earthquake. She didn’t tell her mam the specifics of her plan, just that she was meeting a friend in town. She knew Sharon would worry, and this was a climb she needed to make alone, without the safety net of her mother’s anxiety.

On Tuesday evening, she stood before her wardrobe, the choice of what to wear feeling strangely significant. She was not putting on a uniform or a shield. She was dressing as herself. She chose a simple dark green dress, something she felt comfortable in, and the same sturdy, sensible shoes she had worn to cross the bridge. They were her climbing shoes, a reminder of the solid ground she had fought to reclaim. As she rode the bus into the city, she didn't listen to music or stare out of the window. She focused on her own breathing, a slow, steady rhythm, an anchor in the rising tide of her apprehension. She walked along the quayside, the air cool and damp against her face. Above her, The Glasshouse soared into the indigo sky, a silent, glittering monolith. She stopped at the entrance, a grand, glass-doored portal she had only ever used once, on the day of her initial interview three years ago. This time, she was not here to ask for a job. She was here to quit the one that had taken up residence in her head.

The public lift was a different world from the rattling, functional service elevator. It was a capsule of polished chrome and smoked glass, ascending with a smooth, silent, terrifying speed. Josie kept her back to the glass wall, her eyes fixed on the illuminated floor numbers as they flickered upwards. 5… 10… 15… She felt the familiar, dreaded lightness in her stomach, the sensation of leaving the solid world behind. The old hum began in her bones, a low, thrumming vibration. *It's just the lift mechanism,* she told herself, her fingers gripping the strap of her handbag. *It’s just a machine.* The bell chimed, a soft, expensive sound. The doors slid open on the twenty-second floor. She had arrived.

The wave of sensory memory hit her first. The hushed, reverential quiet, punctuated by the delicate clink of cutlery on porcelain. The low throb of a minimalist electronic soundtrack. The air, cool and filtered, carrying the faint, complex scent of money and fine dining. For a dizzying moment, she was back in her uniform, a tray balanced on her palm, her mind racing with table numbers and special orders. Then she felt the soft fabric of her own dress, the weight of her own handbag, and the moment passed. She was a guest here. A stranger. In front of her, Newcastle unfolded itself like a dark, glittering jewel box, the view as shocking and spectacular as ever. She took a breath, held it, and walked towards the host stand.

A young man with artfully tousled hair and an earpiece looked up, his professional smile faltering for a second as he registered her. He didn't recognise her as a former colleague; he recognised her as someone who did not quite fit. She wasn't wearing designer labels, she wasn't radiating the easy entitlement of the usual clientele. “Good evening,” he said, his voice smooth as silk. “Do you have a reservation?”

“Yes. A table for one. Under the name Josie,” she said, her voice clear and steady. The young man tapped at his screen. "Ah yes. Right this way." He led her into the main dining room, the route taking her past the service station where she had once sought refuge. She glanced at it, at the gleaming coffee machine and the stacks of polished glasses, and felt a strange, nostalgic pang, the kind one might feel for a difficult but formative school. She saw a waitress, her face a mask of strained concentration, hurry past with a heavy tray. Josie saw her own past self in the girl’s tense shoulders and forced smile, and felt a surge of empathy so strong it almost made her stop.

Her table was small, tucked into a corner, flanked on two sides by the floor-to-ceiling glass. It was her worst nightmare, the very epicentre of her trauma. The host pulled out her chair, and she sat, the movement feeling slow and deliberate. "Your server will be with you shortly," he murmured, and then he was gone, leaving her alone with the view. She didn't look out immediately. Instead, she performed her grounding rituals. She planted both feet firmly on the plush carpet, feeling its texture through the soles of her shoes. She pressed her palms flat against the cool, solid wood of the table. She took a slow breath in, smelling the faint scent of beeswax polish, and a slow breath out. Only then did she lift her head and face the abyss.

The city was a breathtaking, silent panorama. The Tyne was a black, jagged tear held together by the staples of its bridges, their lights tracing brilliant, unwavering lines in the darkness. She saw the elegant, familiar arch of the Millennium Bridge, the bridge she had crossed, the monster she had tamed. From here, it looked small, delicate. A toy. She felt the low thrum in the floor, the building's phantom breath. But it felt different now. Weaker. She recognised it not as a living thing, but as a mechanical tremor, the combined vibration of the building’s complex systems and the hundreds of lives moving within it. It wasn't breathing. It was just busy. A shadow fell over her table. "Good evening. Can I get you something to drink?" The voice was clipped, efficient, and achingly familiar. Josie looked up into the furious, astonished face of Mr. Henderson.

He froze for a fraction of a second, the professional mask slipping to reveal a flash of pure, unadulterated shock. His mouth opened and closed silently, his meticulously slicked-back hair seeming to bristle with indignation. The idea of his disgraced, daydreaming waitress returning as a paying customer was a scenario so far outside his rigid worldview that his brain had momentarily short-circuited. But years of high-end service were a powerful anaesthetic. The mask slid back into place, the expression smoothing over into a familiar, pinched neutrality, though a muscle twitched in his jaw. “Josephine,” he said, his voice a low, dangerous purr. “What a… surprise.”

“Mr. Henderson,” Josie replied, her voice calm and level. She felt a flicker of the old, ingrained fear, the automatic deference of employee to boss, but it was quickly extinguished by a new, powerful sense of irony. She was the one with the power here. She was the customer. “I’ll just have a sparkling water, please.” The mundane request, delivered with polite, untroubled confidence, seemed to wrong-foot him completely. He had clearly been expecting tears, a confrontation, or a desperate plea for her old job back. He was not prepared for quiet, unremarkable civility. He stared at her for a moment longer, his mind whirring, searching for the correct protocol for this unprecedented breach of the natural order. “Of course,” he finally managed, the words tight and clipped, before turning on his heel and marching stiffly towards the bar, his back radiating waves of baffled fury.

Josie watched him go, and a small, irrepressible bubble of laughter rose in her throat. She suppressed it, turning it into a cough, but the feeling was undeniable: amusement. The man who had held absolute power over her, whose barked orders had filled her with dread, was now fetching her a glass of water. The balance of the universe had shifted. While she waited, she let her gaze drift around the restaurant. She saw Tasha moving through the tables with her usual sharp-elbowed efficiency, her face set in a mask of professional charm that Josie could now see was brittle as spun sugar. She watched a young waiter struggle to open a bottle of wine under the impatient glare of a wealthy diner, his hands trembling slightly. She saw it all with a new, crystalline clarity. She saw the immense, relentless pressure, the fear of making a mistake, the desperate dance to maintain an illusion of effortless perfection. She wasn't just seeing a restaurant; she was seeing the inner workings of the fear factory that had almost broken her. And all she felt was a profound, liberating relief that she had escaped.

Mr. Henderson returned and placed the glass of water on her table with a sharp, definite click, as if to punctuate his displeasure. He did not speak, simply turned and stalked away to terrorise a junior sommelier near the wine cellar. Josie took a sip of the cold, bubbly water. It tasted like victory. She looked out of the window again. The city lights glittered. The cars on the Redheugh Bridge were a slow, steady stream of red and white. The world outside was calm, orderly, and beautiful. She picked up the dessert menu that had been left on her table, her eyes scanning the familiar list of deconstructed cheesecakes and chocolate spheres. She wasn’t hungry. Her work here was done. She caught the eye of her former colleague, a young waitress named Chloe, and beckoned her over. "Could I just get the bill, please?" Chloe nodded, her face a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

The bill arrived in the familiar leather-bound folder. Four pounds fifty for a bottle of sparkling water. It was the most expensive, and the most valuable, glass of water she had ever had. She placed a ten-pound note inside the folder and smiled at Chloe as she came to collect it. “Keep the change,” she said. She stood up, her movements fluid and unhurried. The floor beneath her feet was completely, blessedly solid. She walked back across the dining room, past the gawping face of Mr. Henderson, past the curious stares of the other staff, her head held high. She didn't look back.

The ride down in the lift was a smooth, controlled descent back to earth. This time, she stood facing the glass, watching as the glittering panorama of the city rose up to meet her, the streets growing wider, the cars larger, the world reassembling itself into a human scale. The lift doors slid open onto the ground floor, and she stepped out into the cool, damp air of the quayside. She took a deep, greedy breath, the air thick with the real, raw smell of the river. She had done it. She had walked into the heart of the storm and found only quiet air. She had faced the ghost, and it had vanished in the light of day. She looked up one last time at the glittering, indifferent tower. It was not a prison. It was not a monster. It was just a building, a landmark on a map, a place where people went to eat expensive food. A place where she used to work. With a small, final smile, she turned her back on it and started the walk home, her sensible shoes making a steady, rhythmic sound on the solid ground. The fall was over.The week leading up to the reservation was a strange limbo. A quiet hum of anticipation, a low-grade nervous energy, sat beneath the surface of her daily life. At the Trattoria, she chopped tomatoes and poured wine with her usual efficiency, but her mind was elsewhere, rehearsing the coming trial. She pictured the lift doors sliding open, the first glimpse of the view, the feel of the plush carpet under her feet. She ran through her coping strategies like a pilot running through a pre-flight checklist: deep breathing, cognitive reframing, grounding techniques. She was as prepared as she could be for a journey into the heart of her own personal earthquake. She didn’t tell her mam the specifics of her plan, just that she was meeting a friend in town. She knew Sharon would worry, and this was a climb she needed to make alone, without the safety net of her mother’s anxiety.

On Tuesday evening, she stood before her wardrobe, the choice of what to wear feeling strangely significant. She was not putting on a uniform or a shield. She was dressing as herself. She chose a simple dark green dress, something she felt comfortable in, and the same sturdy, sensible shoes she had worn to cross the bridge. They were her climbing shoes, a reminder of the solid ground she had fought to reclaim. As she rode the bus into the city, she didn't listen to music or stare out of the window. She focused on her own breathing, a slow, steady rhythm, an anchor in the rising tide of her apprehension. She walked along the quayside, the air cool and damp against her face. Above her, The Glasshouse soared into the indigo sky, a silent, glittering monolith. She stopped at the entrance, a grand, glass-doored portal she had only ever used once, on the day of her initial interview three years ago. This time, she was not here to ask for a job. She was here to quit the one that had taken up residence in her head.

The public lift was a different world from the rattling, functional service elevator. It was a capsule of polished chrome and smoked glass, ascending with a smooth, silent, terrifying speed. Josie kept her back to the glass wall, her eyes fixed on the illuminated floor numbers as they flickered upwards. 5… 10… 15… She felt the familiar, dreaded lightness in her stomach, the sensation of leaving the solid world behind. The old hum began in her bones, a low, thrumming vibration. *It's just the lift mechanism,* she told herself, her fingers gripping the strap of her handbag. *It’s just a machine.* The bell chimed, a soft, expensive sound. The doors slid open on the twenty-second floor. She had arrived.

The wave of sensory memory hit her first. The hushed, reverential quiet, punctuated by the delicate clink of cutlery on porcelain. The low throb of a minimalist electronic soundtrack. The air, cool and filtered, carrying the faint, complex scent of money and fine dining. For a dizzying moment, she was back in her uniform, a tray balanced on her palm, her mind racing with table numbers and special orders. Then she felt the soft fabric of her own dress, the weight of her own handbag, and the moment passed. She was a guest here. A stranger. In front of her, Newcastle unfolded itself like a dark, glittering jewel box, the view as shocking and spectacular as ever. She took a breath, held it, and walked towards the host stand.

A young man with artfully tousled hair and an earpiece looked up, his professional smile faltering for a second as he registered her. He didn't recognise her as a former colleague; he recognised her as someone who did not quite fit. She wasn't wearing designer labels, she wasn't radiating the easy entitlement of the usual clientele. “Good evening,” he said, his voice smooth as silk. “Do you have a reservation?”

“Yes. A table for one. Under the name Josie,” she said, her voice clear and steady. The young man tapped at his screen. "Ah yes. Right this way." He led her into the main dining room, the route taking her past the service station where she had once sought refuge. She glanced at it, at the gleaming coffee machine and the stacks of polished glasses, and felt a strange, nostalgic pang, the kind one might feel for a difficult but formative school. She saw a waitress, her face a mask of strained concentration, hurry past with a heavy tray. Josie saw her own past self in the girl’s tense shoulders and forced smile, and felt a surge of empathy so strong it almost made her stop.

Her table was small, tucked into a corner, flanked on two sides by the floor-to-ceiling glass. It was her worst nightmare, the very epicentre of her trauma. The host pulled out her chair, and she sat, the movement feeling slow and deliberate. "Your server will be with you shortly," he murmured, and then he was gone, leaving her alone with the view. She didn't look out immediately. Instead, she performed her grounding rituals. She planted both feet firmly on the plush carpet, feeling its texture through the soles of her shoes. She pressed her palms flat against the cool, solid wood of the table. She took a slow breath in, smelling the faint scent of beeswax polish, and a slow breath out. Only then did she lift her head and face the abyss.

The city was a breathtaking, silent panorama. The Tyne was a black, jagged tear held together by the staples of its bridges, their lights tracing brilliant, unwavering lines in the darkness. She saw the elegant, familiar arch of the Millennium Bridge, the bridge she had crossed, the monster she had tamed. From here, it looked small, delicate. A toy. She felt the low thrum in the floor, the building's phantom breath. But it felt different now. Weaker. She recognised it not as a living thing, but as a mechanical tremor, the combined vibration of the building’s complex systems and the hundreds of lives moving within it. It wasn't breathing. It was just busy. A shadow fell over her table. "Good evening. Can I get you something to drink?" The voice was clipped, efficient, and achingly familiar. Josie looked up into the furious, astonished face of Mr. Henderson.

He froze for a fraction of a second, the professional mask slipping to reveal a flash of pure, unadulterated shock. His mouth opened and closed silently, his meticulously slicked-back hair seeming to bristle with indignation. The idea of his disgraced, daydreaming waitress returning as a paying customer was a scenario so far outside his rigid worldview that his brain had momentarily short-circuited. But years of high-end service were a powerful anaesthetic. The mask slid back into place, the expression smoothing over into a familiar, pinched neutrality, though a muscle twitched in his jaw. “Josephine,” he said, his voice a low, dangerous purr. “What a… surprise.”

“Mr. Henderson,” Josie replied, her voice calm and level. She felt a flicker of the old, ingrained fear, the automatic deference of employee to boss, but it was quickly extinguished by a new, powerful sense of irony. She was the one with the power here. She was the customer. “I’ll just have a sparkling water, please.” The mundane request, delivered with polite, untroubled confidence, seemed to wrong-foot him completely. He had clearly been expecting tears, a confrontation, or a desperate plea for her old job back. He was not prepared for quiet, unremarkable civility. He stared at her for a moment longer, his mind whirring, searching for the correct protocol for this unprecedented breach of the natural order. “Of course,” he finally managed, the words tight and clipped, before turning on his heel and marching stiffly towards the bar, his back radiating waves of baffled fury.

Josie watched him go, and a small, irrepressible bubble of laughter rose in her throat. She suppressed it, turning it into a cough, but the feeling was undeniable: amusement. The man who had held absolute power over her, whose barked orders had filled her with dread, was now fetching her a glass of water. The balance of the universe had shifted. While she waited, she let her gaze drift around the restaurant. She saw Tasha moving through the tables with her usual sharp-elbowed efficiency, her face set in a mask of professional charm that Josie could now see was brittle as spun sugar. She watched a young waiter struggle to open a bottle of wine under the impatient glare of a wealthy diner, his hands trembling slightly. She saw it all with a new, crystalline clarity. She saw the immense, relentless pressure, the fear of making a mistake, the desperate dance to maintain an illusion of effortless perfection. She wasn't just seeing a restaurant; she was seeing the inner workings of the fear factory that had almost broken her. And all she felt was a profound, liberating relief that she had escaped.

Mr. Henderson returned and placed the glass of water on her table with a sharp, definite click, as if to punctuate his displeasure. He did not speak, simply turned and stalked away to terrorise a junior sommelier near the wine cellar. Josie took a sip of the cold, bubbly water. It tasted like victory. She looked out of the window again. The city lights glittered. The cars on the Redheugh Bridge were a slow, steady stream of red and white. The world outside was calm, orderly, and beautiful. She picked up the dessert menu that had been left on her table, her eyes scanning the familiar list of deconstructed cheesecakes and chocolate spheres. She wasn’t hungry. Her work here was done. She caught the eye of her former colleague, a young waitress named Chloe, and beckoned her over. "Could I just get the bill, please?" Chloe nodded, her face a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

The bill arrived in the familiar leather-bound folder. Four pounds fifty for a bottle of sparkling water. It was the most expensive, and the most valuable, glass of water she had ever had. She placed a ten-pound note inside the folder and smiled at Chloe as she came to collect it. “Keep the change,” she said. She stood up, her movements fluid and unhurried. The floor beneath her feet was completely, blessedly solid. She walked back across the dining room, past the gawping face of Mr. Henderson, past the curious stares of the other staff, her head held high. She didn't look back.

The ride down in the lift was a smooth, controlled descent back to earth. This time, she stood facing the glass, watching as the glittering panorama of the city rose up to meet her, the streets growing wider, the cars larger, the world reassembling itself into a human scale. The lift doors slid open onto the ground floor, and she stepped out into the cool, damp air of the quayside. She took a deep, greedy breath, the air thick with the real, raw smell of the river. She had done it. She had walked into the heart of the storm and found only quiet air. She had faced the ghost, and it had vanished in the light of day. She looked up one last time at the glittering, indifferent tower. It was not a prison. It was not a monster. It was just a building, a landmark on a map, a place where people went to eat expensive food. A place where she used to work. With a small, final smile, she turned her back on it and started the walk home, her sensible shoes making a steady, rhythmic sound on the solid ground. The fall was over.Chapter 8

The walk home was a quiet procession through a city she was seeing for the first time. The familiar landmarks, once just points of reference on a mental map of fear, now seemed new and interesting. The light hitting the stone of the castle keep, the cheerful noise spilling from a pub on the Bigg Market, the reflection of the streetlights on the wet pavement—it was all part of a world she had been too afraid to notice. When she pushed open the door to her mam’s house, the scent of furniture polish and brewing tea wrapped around her like a hug. Sharon was in her armchair, a book open on her lap, but she wasn’t reading. Her gaze was fixed on the hallway, her face a taut canvas of worry that crumpled into profound relief the moment she saw Josie.

"Well?" Sharon asked, her voice quiet but carrying the weight of the entire evening. There was no need for pretence. She knew this hadn't been a casual meeting with a friend.

Josie closed the door, the solid thud of the lock sliding home feeling like a final, definitive seal. She walked into the living room and sank onto the sofa, a wave of pure, bone-deep exhaustion washing over her. "I went," she said simply. "I had a glass of water. It cost four pounds fifty." A small, hysterical laugh escaped her. Sharon didn't say anything. She just got up, went to the kitchen, and returned with two steaming mugs of tea and the Battenberg cake, which she placed on the coffee table with a ceremonial reverence. She sat down opposite Josie, her eyes shining with unshed tears. "And was it?" she asked, her voice thick. "Was it just a building?" Josie met her mother's gaze and nodded, a slow, definitive movement. A single tear escaped and tracked a path down Sharon's cheek, but she was smiling, a wide, brilliant smile of pure, unadulterated pride. "I knew it," she whispered. "I always knew you were tougher than any fancy glass box."

They ate the cake in a comfortable silence, the quiet ticking of the mantelpiece clock filling the space where fear used to be. Josie, unprompted, told her the whole story, from the lift ride to the look on Mr. Henderson’s face. She described it not as a horror story, but as a slightly bizarre comedy, and her mam laughed along with her, the sound a joyful, liberating release in the cosy room. They weren't just sharing cake; they were sharing the victory, dividing the triumph between them until it was no longer a burden Josie had to carry alone, but a shared, warm memory. That night, Josie slept a deep, dreamless sleep, the first in months that was not punctuated by the phantom sensation of falling.

Her final scheduled session with Sarah was less like a therapy appointment and more like a debriefing after a successful mission. Josie recounted the visit to The Glasshouse, her tone calm and analytical. “The strangest thing was, I wasn't even scared of him anymore," she concluded, speaking of Mr. Henderson. "He just looked like a small, angry man in a very big room. I almost felt sorry for him.” Sarah listened, a small, knowing smile on her face. “You didn't just reclaim the space, Josie. You reclaimed your own power. You changed the narrative. You’re no longer the victim of that story; you’re the hero who went back and faced the dragon, only to find it was just a lizard with a loudspeaker.” She closed the notebook on her lap. “This isn’t the end of the work, but it’s the end of the ladder. You have the tools now. You know how to recognise the faulty alarm, and you know how to wait for the feeling to pass. You know that you are stronger than your fear.” They agreed to cancel the regular appointments, leaving the door open for a check-in if she ever felt she needed it. Walking out of the red-brick building for the last time, Josie felt a sense of quiet, profound gratitude. She hadn't been cured; she had been taught.

Life settled into the warm, garlic-scented rhythm of the Trattoria. The passing weeks and months smoothed over the sharp edges of her trauma, turning the raw memory into a scar that was a part of her, but no longer hurt to the touch. One busy Friday night, a young couple came in, their faces flushed with excitement. “We’ve just got engaged!” the woman announced to Josie as she was taking their order. “He proposed up there!” She pointed vaguely out of the window, in the direction of the quayside. “At The Glasshouse. It was so romantic.” A year ago, the comment would have sent Josie reeling. Tonight, she just smiled, a genuine, uncomplicated smile. “Congratulations, that’s wonderful news,” she said. “The view up there is lovely, isn’t it? But you should save room for our tiramisu. It’s Luigi’s nonna’s secret recipe. It’s a lot more memorable than a parsnip purée, I promise.” The couple laughed, and Josie went to put their order in, feeling nothing but a quiet sense of peace.

Later, as she was cashing up with Luigi, he patted her on the shoulder. “You are good for this place, Josie,” he said, his kind, crinkled eyes looking at her with genuine affection. “You have a good heart. You were a songbird in a glass cage. Now, you are a sparrow. Not so fancy, maybe. But you can fly wherever you want.” She knew he was right. The cage, for all its glamour, had been a prison. Here, amongst the noise and the chaos and the checked tablecloths, she was free.

On her walk home, she took the long route along the river. It was a clear, cold night, and the stars were sharp pinpricks in the vast darkness above. She stopped and leaned against the railing, the cold iron solid and real beneath her hands. The whole of the quayside was laid out before her. The sturdy, industrial muscle of the Tyne Bridge, the elegant, winking eye of the Millennium Bridge, the warm, honeycombed lights of the Sage. And there, rising above it all, was The Glasshouse, a silent, glittering spire. She looked at it, and for the first time, she felt nothing. Not fear, not anger, not even triumph. Just a quiet, neutral acceptance. It was a landmark, a part of the city. Her city. She no longer saw Newcastle as a crumpled map to be viewed from a great height. She saw it from the ground up, a place of cobbled streets and noisy pubs, of solid bridges and kind strangers, of brick houses and Battenberg cake. She was not floating above it in an illusion of glass and steel. She was a part of it, her feet planted firmly on its solid, dependable earth. And she knew, with a certainty that was deeper and truer than any fear she had ever felt, that she was finally home.Chapter 9

Spring arrived on the Tyne with a soft, green determination, unfurling in the trees along the quayside and bringing a fresh, damp smell of earth to the city air. The change of season had settled comfortably into Josie’s life. Her world had found its equilibrium, its centre of gravity firmly located in the warm, noisy chaos of Trattoria da Luigi. The background hum of her old anxiety had faded completely, replaced by the clatter of plates, the sizzle of garlic in hot oil, and Luigi’s constant, off-key singing. She had become a fixture, a part of the restaurant’s soul. She knew the regulars by name, their children by age, and their favourite dishes by heart. Her life was measured not in storeys, but in seasons: the winter of her fall had given way to a tentative spring of recovery, which had now blossomed into the full, confident summer of her new life.

She was returning from the quayside market on a bright Saturday morning, a canvas bag laden with fresh basil and heritage tomatoes for Luigi’s weekend special, when she saw her. The figure was hunched on a bench overlooking the river, staring out at the water with a vacant intensity. Even from a distance, the expensive cut of the camel-hair coat was unmistakable, but the posture was all wrong. It lacked the sharp, aggressive angle Josie associated with its owner. This person was not surveying her kingdom; she was shipwrecked. As Josie drew closer, her steps slowing, she saw the meticulously styled blonde hair was now dull and slightly dishevelled, escaping its pins in sad, tired wisps. It was Tasha, but a version that had been hollowed out, the cynical, brittle energy replaced by a profound and weary emptiness.

A complex cocktail of emotions swirled in Josie’s gut. There was a ghost of her old fear, a flicker of resentment, but it was quickly drowned by an unexpected and overwhelming wave of pity. She saw not the tormentor from the staff room, but another casualty of the glass tower. She saw someone who had fallen just as surely as she had, only from a different kind of height. The old Josie would have crossed the street, her heart pounding, eager to avoid a confrontation. The new Josie, the one who had walked the bridge and faced the void, simply altered her course and walked towards the bench. She stopped a few feet away, the bag of tomatoes a solid, earthy weight in her hand. “Tasha?” she asked, her voice quiet.

Tasha started, her head snapping around. For a moment, her eyes were wide and lost, the eyes of a stranger. Then, recognition dawned, and the old, reflexive armour began to clang into place. A sneer formed on her lips, but it was a pale imitation of her former prowess, a theatrical gesture with no conviction behind it. “Well, look at you. The patron saint of pasta,” she said, her voice a dry rasp. “Come to offer the poor and destitute a pity breadstick?” She tried to pull herself up straighter, to recapture some of her old, sharp-edged authority, but the effort seemed to exhaust her, and she slumped back against the bench.

Josie ignored the jibe, her gaze taking in the dark circles under Tasha’s eyes, the faint tremor in her hands. She was looking at a mirror image of herself from months ago, a person running on nothing but adrenaline and fear. “It’s a bit cold to be sitting out,” Josie said, her tone gentle, matter-of-fact. “Come on. Let me get you a coffee.” She gestured towards a small, independent café a little way down the path, its windows steamed up and promising warmth. The offer was simple, practical, and it seemed to short-circuit Tasha’s defensive programming. She stared at Josie, her mouth slightly agape, suspicion and desperation warring in her eyes. The desperation won. With a tired, defeated sigh, she nodded mutely and allowed herself to be led away from the river.

They sat in a small, anonymous café, the air thick with the smell of roasting coffee and toasted sandwiches. Tasha wrapped her cold hands around the thick ceramic mug as if it were a lifeline, her eyes fixed on the swirling pattern in the foam. For a long time, she said nothing, and Josie didn’t push, simply sipping her own tea and allowing the silence to do its work. Finally, Tasha spoke, her voice low and brittle, stripped of all its former irony. “He sacked me,” she said, the words falling into the space between them like stones. “Henderson. A month ago. I mixed up a wine order for some hedge fund manager. A three-hundred-pound bottle of red instead of a three-hundred-and-fifty-pound one. The man didn’t even notice. But Henderson did.” She gave a short, humourless laugh that sounded like breaking glass. “He called it ‘a catastrophic lapse in attention to detail’. Said he couldn’t have ‘instability’ on his floor.”

Josie felt a cold shock of recognition. The same word. The same clinical, surgical dismissal. She looked at Tasha and saw the full story. The relentless pressure, the impossible standards, the constant fear of making one tiny, fatal error. Tasha had built her entire identity on being the perfect, unflappable waitress, the one who thrived in the high-altitude pressure cooker. When that identity was stripped away, there had been nothing left underneath but a terrifying, empty space. “I started getting dizzy,” Tasha whispered, her gaze dropping back to her coffee cup as if ashamed. “Feeling like the whole place was… swaying. I thought I was going mad.”

Josie reached across the small table and placed her hand gently over Tasha’s. The contact was electric, a current of shared, unspoken understanding. Tasha flinched but didn’t pull away. “You’re not going mad, Tasha,” Josie said, her voice soft but firm with the authority of experience. “It’s the place. It’s designed to make you feel like you’re floating, but it forgets that people need to feel the ground. It’s a faulty alarm. Your brain is just telling you that the danger you feel is real.” She was using Sarah’s words, her therapist’s logic, but they were her own truth now, a truth she was passing on like a gift.

Tasha looked up, her eyes swimming with tears she was trying desperately to hold back. The hard, cynical mask had finally disintegrated, revealing the terrified, bewildered person beneath. “What do I do?” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I have nothing else. That job… it was everything.” Josie thought for a moment. She could have offered false platitudes, or smug advice. Instead, she took a napkin from the dispenser on the table and, borrowing a pen from the waitress, wrote down a name and a number. She pushed the small, flimsy piece of paper across the table. On it was written: *Sarah. Northern Mind & Wellbeing.* “She helped me find the ground again,” Josie said simply. “She can help you, too.” Tasha stared at the napkin as if it were a foreign object, then slowly, her trembling fingers closed around it. She didn’t say thank you, but her eyes, for the first time, held a flicker of something that wasn’t fear or anger, but a tiny, fragile seed of hope.They sat in the small, anonymous café, the air thick with the smell of roasting coffee and toasted sandwiches.

She didn’t say thank you, but her eyes, for the first time, held a flicker of something that wasn’t fear or anger, but a tiny, fragile seed of hope.

After a long silence, broken only by the hiss of the coffee machine, Tasha finally found her voice again, though it was rough with unshed tears. "Why?" she asked, the single word a raw, genuine question. "After the way I treated you. I was horrible to you, Josie. Especially at the end. Why would you do this?" It was the closest to an apology Tasha was capable of, an admission of guilt wrapped in a question of disbelief.

Josie took a sip of her now-lukewarm tea, considering her answer. "Because I get it," she said, her voice free of sanctimony. "I get what it's like to build your life on something that high up. You spend all your time terrified of falling, you forget you can just choose to come back down." She glanced out of the café window at the people hurrying past on the solid pavement. "This," she gestured vaguely at her own comfortable, ordinary life, "working for Luigi, it's not a step down. It's just a different direction. It's more... horizontal."

A wry, watery smile touched Tasha's lips. "Horizontal," she repeated, the word sounding strange and foreign. She carefully folded the napkin and tucked it deep into a zipped compartment of her expensive handbag, a secret to be examined later, in private. The gesture was more telling than any verbal promise. She was keeping it. She was keeping the option of solid ground. She gathered her things, the familiar clink of her designer bag a stark contrast to her newfound vulnerability. "Well," she said, standing up, her composure partially restored. "I should go. Got to... go." She left the destination hanging in the air, a terrifying, unwritten future. She didn't say goodbye or thank you, but as she reached the door, she paused and looked back at Josie, a complex, unreadable expression on her face, before disappearing into the bright, indifferent afternoon.

Josie paid for the coffees and walked back out into the spring sunshine, the canvas bag of tomatoes feeling reassuringly heavy in her hand. The encounter hadn't dragged her down or reawakened her own trauma. Instead, she felt a strange lightness, a sense of a final circle being closed. She had looked her own ghost in the face and, instead of running, had offered it a cup of coffee. The act of compassion had been the final, definitive proof of her own recovery. She was no longer a victim of the fall; she was a survivor who knew the way back down.

When she arrived back at the Trattoria, the warm, noisy embrace of the restaurant welcomed her home. Luigi was shouting in mock-fury at the kitchen porter, a boisterous opera of complaint that would end, as it always did, in shared laughter. "Ah, Josie! You have the tomatoes!" he boomed, his face breaking into a wide grin. "They are beautiful! Tonight, we make a sauce that will make the angels weep!" Josie smiled, handing over the bag, the mundane reality of her work a comforting, solid anchor. Her life was here now, in the smell of basil and the weight of hot plates and the easy, unpretentious kindness of the people around her. It was a life built not on a view, but on a foundation. As she tied on her apron, ready for the lunchtime rush, she knew with a quiet, unshakeable certainty that she had not just survived the fall from The Glasshouse. She had found a better place to land.Chapter 10

A year later, the rhythm of Josie’s life was marked by the steady, percussive chop of a knife through onions and the cheerful glug of house red being poured into carafes. The Trattoria had become more than a job; it was the soil in which she had replanted herself, and she had thrived. The frantic, high-wire tension of her old life had been replaced by a deep, physical tiredness at the end of each shift, the satisfying ache of a body that had worked hard and well. She now moved through the bustling restaurant not with the hunted efficiency of a survivor, but with the easy, confident grace of someone who belonged. She could anticipate Luigi’s needs from the set of his shoulders and calm a kitchen crisis with a quiet word and a well-timed joke. She was no longer just a waitress; she was the steady hand on the tiller, the calm centre of Luigi’s chaotic, big-hearted storm.

Her relationship with Luigi had evolved into a warm, familial partnership. He had, over many months and with much theatrical gesturing, taught her the secrets of his nonna’s sauce, a sacred trust bestowed with more ceremony than any promotion Mr. Henderson had ever given. He had started leaving her in charge on quiet Tuesday afternoons, trusting her with the keys, the cash box, and the restaurant’s soul. “You have the heart for this place, Josie,” he’d told her one evening, as they shared a post-service limoncello. “You know that the food, it is not just for the belly. It is to make people feel safe, to make them feel home. You learned this not in a fancy glass box, but in your bones.” He was right. The service she provided now was not about creating an illusion for the wealthy, but about offering a small, tangible moment of comfort, a bowl of hot pasta on a rainy day, a space where people could feel connected not to a view, but to each other.

She saw Tasha only once during that year. It was a bright, blustery afternoon in autumn, and Josie was on her way to the bank. Across the busy road, near a bus stop, a group of people waited. Among them was a woman in a smart, sensible navy coat, her blonde hair cut into a practical, no-nonsense bob. She was holding a briefcase and talking on her phone, a slight frown of concentration on her face. For a moment, Josie didn’t recognise her. This woman looked solid, grounded, utterly unremarkable. Then the woman turned her head, and Josie saw the familiar sharp line of her jaw. It was Tasha. But the frantic, brittle energy was gone, replaced by a kind of weary competence. She looked like a solicitor, or an accountant, someone who dealt in facts and figures, not in illusions and Chablis. Tasha’s eyes flickered across the street and met Josie’s for a fraction of a second. There was no sneer, no condescension. Just a brief, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement, a silent signal that passed between two veterans of a war no one else knew had been fought. Then the bus arrived, and Tasha got on, disappearing into the anonymous flow of the city.

It was Sharon who suggested the day trip. “We haven’t had a proper day out, just the two of us, in years,” she announced one Sunday morning, brandishing a bus timetable like a declaration of intent. “I fancy a bit of sea air. Blow the cobwebs away. Let’s go to Tynemouth. We can get fish and chips and walk along the cliffs.” Josie agreed instantly, a quiet thrill running through her. The cliffs. The idea of standing on the edge of a great, natural height, looking out over the vastness of the North Sea, no longer held any terror. It held only the promise of open space and clean, salty air. The thought of the drop was still there, a factual piece of information, but it no longer came with the visceral, gut-wrenching certainty of a fall. It was simply a feature of the landscape.

They walked along the grassy path that traced the cliff’s edge, the wind whipping their hair and tugging at their coats. To their left, the ancient priory stood stark and beautiful against the wide sky. To their right, the grey-green sea churned and crashed against the rocks far below. It was a drop far greater than any she had faced on the Millennium Bridge, a sheer, dizzying plunge into the cold, powerful ocean. Josie walked to the edge of the path, her sensible shoes planted firmly on the damp earth, and looked down. She felt the wind push against her, a real, physical force. She saw the gulls wheeling on the updrafts far below her. And she felt… nothing but awe. There was no lurch, no tilt, no phantom vibration. There was only the solid, dependable ground beneath her feet and the immense, wild beauty of the world laid out before her. The faulty alarm in her head was finally, completely silent, content to trust in the reality of the earth.

Sharon came to stand beside her, their shoulders touching, a silent, supportive presence. Together, they looked out at the horizon, where the sea and sky met in a seamless, grey-blue line. Josie thought back to the view from the twenty-second floor, the city spread out like a map for a king in his castle. That view had been about power, about looking down on the world from a place of detached, artificial supremacy. This view was different. It was not about looking down, but looking out. It did not make her feel powerful; it made her feel part of something vast, ancient, and profoundly real. The fall from The Glasshouse had been the most terrifying experience of her life, but it had also been a gift. It had shattered the illusion she had been living in and forced her to find the ground. And now, standing firmly on that ground, she was finally able to look up at the sky and out at the sea, not with fear, but with a quiet, joyful sense of her own small, wonderful place in it all.A year later, the rhythm of Josie’s life was marked by the steady, percussive chop of a knife through onions and the cheerful glug of house red being poured into carafes. The Trattoria had become more than a job; it was the soil in which she had replanted herself, and she had thrived. The frantic, high-wire tension of her old life had been replaced by a deep, physical tiredness at the end of each shift, the satisfying ache of a body that had worked hard and well. She now moved through the bustling restaurant not with the hunted efficiency of a survivor, but with the easy, confident grace of someone who belonged. She could anticipate Luigi’s needs from the set of his shoulders and calm a kitchen crisis with a quiet word and a well-timed joke. She was no longer just a waitress; she was the steady hand on the tiller, the calm centre of Luigi’s chaotic, big-hearted storm.

Her relationship with Luigi had evolved into a warm, familial partnership. He had, over many months and with much theatrical gesturing, taught her the secrets of his nonna’s sauce, a sacred trust bestowed with more ceremony than any promotion Mr. Henderson had ever given. He had started leaving her in charge on quiet Tuesday afternoons, trusting her with the keys, the cash box, and the restaurant’s soul. “You have the heart for this place, Josie,” he’d told her one evening, as they shared a post-service limoncello. “You know that the food, it is not just for the belly. It is to make people feel safe, to make them feel home. You learned this not in a fancy glass box, but in your bones.” He was right. The service she provided now was not about creating an illusion for the wealthy, but about offering a small, tangible moment of comfort, a bowl of hot pasta on a rainy day, a space where people could feel connected not to a view, but to each other.

She saw Tasha only once during that year. It was a bright, blustery afternoon in autumn, and Josie was on her way to the bank. Across the busy road, near a bus stop, a group of people waited. Among them was a woman in a smart, sensible navy coat, her blonde hair cut into a practical, no-nonsense bob. She was holding a briefcase and talking on her phone, a slight frown of concentration on her face. For a moment, Josie didn’t recognise her. This woman looked solid, grounded, utterly unremarkable.

And now, standing firmly on that ground, she was finally able to look up at the sky and out at the sea, not with fear, but with a quiet, joyful sense of her own small, wonderful place in it all.The passage of another year found Josie rooted deep in the rich, fertile soil of the Trattoria. The frantic, high-wire tension that had once defined her existence had been replaced by the steady, comforting rhythm of the seasons, measured in the changing specials on the chalkboard and the ebb and flow of tourist trade along the quayside. The restaurant was no longer just her workplace; it was the brick-and-mortar heart of her life, a place she tended to with a fierce, quiet devotion. Her relationship with Luigi had deepened into a familial bond, a partnership built on shared laughter, the secrets of his nonna’s sauce, and a mutual understanding that the most important ingredient in any dish was the care with which it was made.

The first sign of a shift in the tectonic plates of her world arrived not with a tremor, but with a single, crisp white envelope. It came with the morning post, addressed to Luigi in a cold, characterless typeface. Josie watched him slit it open with his thumb, his face crinkling in a familiar smile of curiosity that slowly, almost imperceptibly, flattened and faded as he read. The usual booming commentary that accompanied his morning espresso was absent, replaced by a heavy, uncharacteristic silence. He folded the letter, tucked it into his apron pocket, and spent the rest of the day moving through the kitchen like a man carrying a secret, fragile weight, his boisterous energy muted, his easy laughter replaced by a distant, worried frown.

Josie waited until the last of the evening’s customers had trickled out into the night, leaving behind the pleasant carnage of a busy service. As she wiped down the last of the checked tablecloths, the air thick with the lingering scent of wine and garlic, she finally broke the silence that had stretched between them all day. “What is it, Luigi?” she asked softly, her voice carrying across the quiet room. “What did that letter say?” For a moment, she thought he might brush her off, but instead, he sighed, a deep, weary sound that seemed to come from his very bones. He pulled the letter from his pocket, his hand trembling slightly, and smoothed it out on the bar. The letterhead was sleek and corporate: ‘Sterling Quays Development’. The words were a cold, sterile jargon of acquisition, regeneration, and financial offers. They wanted to buy the entire building, along with the two shops next to it, to demolish them and build a block of luxury river-view apartments. The figure they were offering was astronomical, a number with enough zeroes to make Josie’s breath catch in her throat.

Luigi sank onto a barstool, looking older than she had ever seen him. “My knees, Josie,” he said, rubbing his right leg with a pained expression. “They ache in the morning. My sister in Sicily, she sends me pictures of her grandchildren. I have not seen them learn to walk. This money…” he gestured at the letter with a helpless shrug, “it is a ticket home. A chance to be an old man in the sun, not an old man smelling of garlic and floor polish.” He looked around his beloved restaurant, his eyes full of a profound, heartbreaking conflict. “This place, it is my life. But maybe… maybe my life is ready for a new chapter. And I am too tired to fight these people. They are like the tide, these men with their money. They always win.”

The walk home was a journey through a landscape that suddenly felt precarious. The solid, dependable pavement beneath her feet seemed to have lost its integrity. Luigi’s words echoed in her mind, not as a betrayal, but as a sad, inescapable truth. The Trattoria was not just her job; it was her sanctuary, the physical proof that she had found her footing. It was the ground zero of her recovery. The thought of it being gone, replaced by another sterile glass box full of people who paid for the illusion of floating, was a new and terrifying kind of vertigo. It wasn’t a fear of falling anymore; it was the fear of the ground itself disappearing, of being cast adrift again in a world where everything solid could be bought and demolished.

She found her mam in the living room, knitting needles clicking a steady, comforting rhythm. Josie relayed the news in a flat, numb voice, the words feeling like a foreign language in her mouth. Sharon listened, her knitting falling still in her lap, her expression softening with sympathy. “Oh, pet,” she said softly. “The poor man. It’s a hard choice for him to make.” She was right, of course. It was Luigi’s life, his future. But all Josie could feel was the selfish, childish panic of having her safety net ripped away. “But what will I do, Mam?” the words slipped out, small and scared. “That place… it’s everything.” Sharon looked at her daughter, at the quiet strength she had fought so hard to build, and saw the first flicker of the old fear returning to her eyes. “Well,” she said, her voice practical but kind. “You’ll do what you always do, our Josie. You’ll find a way to stand on your own two feet. You’re good at that now.”

Later that night, unable to sleep, Josie sat in the quiet dark of the kitchen, the distant glow of the streetlights painting pale stripes on the linoleum floor. The developer’s cold, corporate name, ‘Sterling Quays’, circled in her mind. It was the language of The Glasshouse, a world that valued views over substance, profit over people. She thought of what Luigi had said, that the restaurant had a heart. A heart that was about to be bulldozed for river-view balconies. An idea, quiet and insane at first, began to take root in the fertile soil of her panic. It was an idea so audacious, so far beyond the scope of her sensible, one-day-at-a-time life, that it almost made her laugh. She couldn’t stop the tide of money and development. She couldn’t fight a company like Sterling Quays. But what if she didn’t have to? What if she could offer Luigi something else? Not just a competing price, but a promise. A promise to keep the heart of his restaurant beating. The thought was a new kind of precipice, a cliff face of finance and business and impossible odds. But for the first time in her life, looking up at an impossible height, Josie didn’t feel the urge to run away. She felt the undeniable, terrifying, thrilling desire to climb.
