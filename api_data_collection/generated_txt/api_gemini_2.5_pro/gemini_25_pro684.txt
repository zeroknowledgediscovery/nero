The air over Kuala Lumpur was thick enough to drink, a soupy cocktail of humidity, exhaust fumes, and the promise of rain. From her perch atop the crumbling cornice of a pre-war shophouse in Pudu, Seri Bintang could taste the ozone building in the bruised purple clouds that boiled over the city. Her wings, the colour of a Rajah Brooke's birdwing, twitched in the restless currents. They were mostly for show these days, for balance and the occasional dramatic flair. Flying in a city this dense was a fool's game of navigating power lines, satellite dishes, and the unpredictable updrafts from a thousand air-conditioning units. It was easier to take the LRT.

Beside her, a low rumble vibrated through the concrete. It wasn't thunder. Not yet. It was Bayang. He lay flat, a sinuous shadow of black muscle and coiled power, his puma’s tail giving a slow, irritated flick against the weathered tiles. His golden eyes, ancient and knowing, were fixed on the street below, a chaotic river of honking Myvis and sputtering delivery scooters. He wasn't native to these lands, this concrete jungle. A creature of deep forests and silent mountains, displaced by a magical rift decades ago. Seri had found him as a cub, bewildered and alone in the shadow of the Batu Caves, and they had been inseparable since. He was her anchor, her silence, her muscle. She was his home.

She didn't need to hear his thoughts to know what he was feeling. The air was wrong. It was more than just the impending monsoon. A sickly sweet energy, like rotting fruit and cheap cologne, was beginning to curdle the atmosphere. It was a magical signature as subtle as a clown on fire.

Jebat.

"Aiyo," Seri murmured, the word a small puff of exasperation. "Not today. Please, not today."

Bayang’s rumble deepened. He lifted his massive head, nostrils flaring as he tasted the disturbance. His gaze shifted from the traffic to a flock of pigeons cooing on a telephone wire. As if on cue, the birds stopped their gentle burbling. A shimmering, greasy film of light washed over them, and then, in a chorus of screeching, unnatural voices, they began to squawk.

"There once was a fairy from Gombak," one screeched, "whose magical spells were all comeback!"

"He tried to turn lead into gold," another squawked, its head bobbing maniacally, "but it just turned moldy and old!"

The flock erupted into a cacophony of avian heckling. Below, pedestrians stopped and stared, their phones immediately coming out to record the bizarre spectacle. A man in a foodpanda uniform nearly swerved into a lamppost.

Seri pinched the bridge of her nose, her iridescent wings drooping in resignation. This was his opening act. The warm-up comedian before the deeply unfunny headliner. Jebat’s idea of a calling card was to inflict his terrible sense of humour on the local wildlife. It was petty. It was pointless. And it was designed specifically to get under her skin.

"Come," she said, her voice tight. Bayang rose in a single, fluid motion, silent as falling dusk. He didn't need to be told twice. Leaping from the roof's edge, he landed with a soft thud in the back alley four stories below, melting into the shadows cast by overflowing dumpsters. Seri followed, not with a grand flight, but with a short, controlled drop, her wings catching her just before she hit the pavement, the maneuver more parkour than pixie.

The alley stank of fermented garbage and stale cooking oil. A rat the size of a small cat scurried past Bayang’s paws, wisely deciding this was not a predator to be trifled with. Seri ignored it. Her senses were stretched out, feeling for the epicentre of the disturbance. The pigeon-patter was just noise, a distraction. Jebat never wasted an entrance, no matter how juvenile. The real prank, the actual point of this whole irritating display, would be somewhere else.

She closed her eyes, filtering out the city's roar. The thrum of the monorail on its track, the sizzle of satay on a nearby grill, the distant call to prayer from the Masjid Jamek. She pushed past it all, searching for that specific brand of chaotic, attention-seeking magic. And then she found it. A sour little knot of power, pulsing like a bad headache, centred on Jalan Alor. Of course. The city’s stomach. Where better to cause a little magical indigestion?

"He's at the night market," she said, her voice flat. Bayang padded out of the alley's mouth, his head low, and glanced back at her. The look was clear. *Let's go.*

They moved through the city like ghosts. Seri kept to the crowded five-foot ways, a small, unassuming figure in jeans and a plain t-shirt, her wings folded so tightly against her back they were almost invisible under her loose cotton shirt. Bayang slunk through the parallel world of back alleys and storm drains, a fleeting shadow glimpsed only in the corner of an eye, dismissed as a trick of the light. They met at the entrance to Jalan Alor, the famous food street already a riot of sound, light, and smell.

The air was electric with the hiss of woks and the chatter of a hundred conversations. Tourists and locals alike thronged the narrow street, weaving between plastic tables groaning with food. The smell of grilled chicken wings, durian, and smoky char kway teow was overwhelming. But underneath it all, Seri could taste it more strongly now: Jebat's magic. It clung to the steam rising from a particular stall, a popular mamak joint known for its legendary *teh tarik*.

The stall was in chaos. Not the usual organised chaos of a busy eatery, but genuine pandemonium. The *anneh* pulling the tea was staring at his frothing mixture with horror. Customers were standing on chairs, gesticulating wildly. A group of Japanese tourists were huddled together, looking utterly baffled.

Seri and Bayang slipped into the throng. A man at a nearby table, his face red with frustration, slammed his hand down. "For the last time, I did not ask for the bill! I asked what has a face and two hands but no arms or legs!"

His friend threw his hands up in despair. "A clock! I know it's a clock! But why are you asking me? I just wanted to know if you enjoyed the chicken!"

"Because what goes up but never comes down?" the first man shot back, his eyes wide with a frantic energy.

Seri’s heart sank. Riddles. He'd enchanted the tea to make everyone who drank it speak only in riddles. It was a step up from the pigeons, she had to admit. It was disruptive, confusing, and was causing genuine distress without actually hurting anyone. His specialty. She scanned the crowd, looking for his smug, shimmering form. He wouldn't be here in person. Never. He was a coward who preferred to heckle from the cheap seats of reality.

There. Leaning against the hot plate of the Ramly Burger stall next door, an illusion of Jebat shimmered into view. He was wearing a ridiculously flashy shirt patterned with hibiscus flowers and, to Seri's disgust, a fedora. He caught her eye and gave a theatrical wink. A faint, magical sound, like a canned sitcom laugh track, echoed only in her ears.

*What do you call a fairy who can't make up his mind?* his voice echoed in her mind, oozing smarm. *Maybe.*

Seri didn’t grace him with a response. She walked straight to the frantic mamak stall owner. "Uncle," she said calmly, "you need to stop serving the tea. Just for a while."

The man turned to her, his face a mask of sweat and panic. "I cannot! They keep asking for it! But when I give it, they get angry and start talking nonsense! What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?"

"Man," Seri answered automatically, a piece of ancient trivia she hadn't thought about in years. "Just stop for a moment. Trust me."

She placed a hand on the large metal dispenser of tea. It was warm. She closed her eyes and focused, extending a thread of her own magic, a clean, quiet energy that tasted of rain and limestone. She felt Jebat's spell. It was… sloppily made. A tangled, garish knot of power, all flash and no substance. It was woven with insecurity. Like a joke told too loudly to cover up the fact that it isn't funny. Unpicking it would be easy, but tedious. A magical janitorial job.

*Oh, come on, Seri-ous,* Jebat's voice buzzed in her head again, the pun landing with a physical thud in her consciousness. *Don't be a spoilsport. I'm just adding a little flavour to the evening! A little… mystea-que!*

The canned laughter again. Seri ignored him, focusing on the threads of his spell. She began to gently pull them apart. It was like untangling a cheap necklace. One by one, the knots came loose. A man at a table suddenly blinked and looked at his friend. "A clock? Why was I talking about a clock? Pass the sambal."

Relief began to spread through the crowd as the enchantment faded. The stall owner sagged against his counter, wiping his brow with his arm. "Thank you, miss. I don't know what… what happened."

"Bad batch of sugar," Seri said, offering a small, dismissive shrug. It was always best to provide a mundane explanation. Humans were remarkably good at accepting them.

She turned to where Jebat's illusion had been. It was gone. She felt the last of his cheap, cloying magic dissipate from the area. But it left an aftertaste. A residue. This was too simple, even for him. The pigeons, the tea… it was all so public, so noisily conspicuous. It was a performance. And every performer wants you to look at the stage, not at what's happening backstage.

Bayang appeared at her side, a phantom of the night. He nudged her hand with his head, his golden eyes looking past the food street, towards the glittering heart of the city. Towards the twin spires of the Petronas Towers, which scraped the belly of the storm clouds.

And then she felt it. A deeper thrum of power, far away from this street-level chaos. The riddle-tea wasn't the trick. It was the misdirection. The riddles themselves… "What walks on four legs…", "what has a face and two hands…". They were all about time. And what was the biggest clock in the city? The one everyone set their watches by?

The towers.

He was doing something at the towers. Something that required her to be distracted here, dealing with his nonsense. A cold dread, far more chilling than the impending rain, washed over her. This wasn't just a prank. This was the setup. The punchline was yet to come.

"He played us," she whispered, her hand resting on Bayang's powerful neck. The puma let out a soft chuff of air, a puff of agreement. They had wasted precious minutes cleaning up his mess while he was setting up his real joke.

Without another word, they turned their backs on the lights and noise of Jalan Alor. The first fat drops of rain began to fall, splattering against the hot pavement with a sizzle. They were big, warm drops that smelled of dust and sky. Ahead of them, the Petronas Towers gleamed, two silver needles stitching the city to the angry heavens. And somewhere, in their shadow, Jebat was waiting. The game had just begun.The race to the Kuala Lumpur City Centre was a frantic, silent ballet. Seri abandoned the five-foot ways for the slick tarmac of the back roads, her bare feet finding purchase where worn-out sneakers would have slipped. The rain came in earnest now, a tropical deluge that turned the streets into dark, shimmering mirrors reflecting the neon signs of massage parlours and 24-hour convenience stores. It washed the cloying sweetness of Jebat's magic from the air, but not the cold knot of dread in Seri's stomach. Bayang kept pace, a creature of liquid night, his form barely distinguishable from the deep shadows between buildings. Water streamed from his black coat, but it did not slow him. They were a strange pair: a slight, rain-soaked girl with hidden wings and a beast from another world, moving with a shared purpose through the guts of the sleeping city.

They emerged into the manicured perfection of the KLCC Park. The contrast was jarring. Here, there were no overflowing dumpsters or the smell of stale oil, only the clean scent of wet earth and expensive, landscaped foliage. The fountains were off, the wide promenades eerily empty. A few drenched security guards huddled under the awnings of the Suria KLCC shopping mall, their attention fixed on their phones, oblivious. Everything seemed too still, too quiet. The symphony of the city, which should have been a muted roar even here, was muffled, as if they were listening to it through a thick wall of glass. The Petronas Towers dominated the sky, their floodlights cutting through the downpour, but they looked wrong. They seemed flat, like a photograph of themselves, lacking the vibrant hum of life that always pulsed within them.

Seri stopped at the edge of the great reflecting pool, the rain plastering her dark hair to her face. She closed her eyes, ignoring the physical world to taste the magical one. The "mysteaque" at Jalan Alor had been a firecracker; this was a bomb. Jebat's signature, that nauseating blend of arrogance and insecurity, was wrapped around the twin towers from foundation to spire. It wasn't a knot this time, but a cage. A sphere of shimmering, greasy power that pulsed with a sickeningly regular beat. It wasn't attacking the towers; it was containing them. And inside that cage, the flow of time itself was stuttering. It was skipping, like a scratched VCD, repeating the same few seconds over and over again. He had trapped thousands of people—cleaners, security staff, late-night office workers, residents of the high-end apartments—in a temporal hiccup.

A low, guttural growl rumbled from Bayang’s chest, a sound of profound wrongness. As a creature of instinct and natural cycles, the perversion of time was a physical affront to him. He shook his massive head, water flying from his ears, his golden eyes fixed on the towers with a look of deep disgust. This was not a prank; this was a violation. A desecration of the natural order for the sake of a punchline only Jebat found funny. He looked at Seri, and the message was as clear as a shout in the sudden quiet. *This must be undone.*

"He's looped them," Seri confirmed, her voice barely a whisper against the drumming of the rain. "The whole of Tower Two and the upper floors of Tower One. The Skybridge… he's using the Skybridge as the anchor." It was just his style. The highest public point, the most famous architectural feature, the literal bridge between two worlds. He had turned it into the keystone of his most ambitious, most infuriating joke to date. To break the spell, she would have to get up there and unpick his gaudy, unstable magic at its source. But unpicking the spell was the easy part; the lock was never as complicated as the box it was on.

Getting there was another matter entirely. The main entrances to the towers would be part of the time loop, the guards within trapped in the same few seconds of motion as everyone else. She could try to fly, but the storm was turning into a gale, the wind whipping around the two colossal structures with terrifying force. Her wings, beautiful as they were, were not built for this kind of weather, not at this altitude. They were for flitting through the canopies of ancient forests, not for battling a monsoon 88 storeys up. They were trapped outside, looking in at a silent catastrophe, separated from their goal by a hundred metres of steel, glass, and Jebat's ego.Bayang nudged her again, harder this time, the gesture sharp with impatience. He could tear through a steel fence if he wanted to, but they both knew this shimmering cage wasn’t made of anything so simple. A direct assault would be like punching water; messy, exhausting, and ultimately futile. Jebat would have layered his spell with alarms, tripwires that would sing her name to every magical creature, friendly or otherwise, from here to the Straits of Malacca. No, brute force was out. And flying… Seri looked up at the spires, at the way the wind tore sheets of rain from the glass, and shook her head. It would be suicide.

Her gaze dropped from the spires to their dark reflection in the agitated water of the pool. The solution wasn't up. It was down. The towers, for all their sky-scraping glamour, were still rooted in the earth. They had foundations, plumbing, electrical conduits, maintenance tunnels. A whole subterranean nervous system that fed the glittering giant above. A world Jebat, with his love for the grand and the visible, would have overlooked. He'd secured the front door and the windows, but he wouldn't have bothered with the basement toilet.

"There," Seri breathed, her focus narrowing. She pointed towards a dense thicket of heliconia and hibiscus bushes near the edge of the park, where the manicured lawn met the concrete perimeter. To a normal eye, it was just landscaping. To her, it was a disguise. A subtle dissonance hummed beneath the soil, a point where the artificial irrigation systems of the park met the industrial guts of the tower's foundation. A place where pipes and drains converged. "He's shielded the main building, but he forgot about the plumbing."

Without waiting for a reply, she moved, a swift, low run that barely disturbed the rain-soaked grass. Bayang followed, a ripple in the darkness at her heels. They plunged into the dripping foliage, the large leaves slapping against their faces. Hidden behind the decorative plants, set into a low concrete wall, was a heavy iron grate, bolted shut. The air wafting from it smelled of rust, damp earth, and ozone from the powerful machinery deep within. It was locked, of course, but it was a simple, physical lock, blessedly free of any magical meddling. Bayang didn't even wait for her to ask. He hooked the thick claws of one paw into the gap between the grate and the frame. With a low grunt and a hideous screech of protesting metal, he tore the entire thing, bolts and all, from its concrete housing. The clang as it hit the muddy ground was swallowed by a peal of thunder.

The tunnel beyond was a tight, black square, barely a metre high. Seri ducked inside without hesitation, the oppressive darkness a welcome relief from the storm. Bayang squeezed in after her, his bulk making it a close fit. The air was cool and thick with the hum of unseen transformers. Water dripped from the ceiling in a steady, maddening rhythm. They moved forward, Seri leading the way, her senses a better guide here than sight. She could feel the conduits around them, vast arteries of power, water, and data, all pulsing with the steady, artificial life of the building. They were below the time loop. Here, in the belly of the beast, time flowed as it should.

After a few hundred metres of stooped walking, the narrow pipe opened into a vast, cavernous space. Emergency lights cast long, distorted shadows across a concrete floor slick with condensation. It was a sub-basement, a city beneath the city, filled with colossal water pumps, air-conditioning chillers, and backup generators the size of small lorries. The sheer scale of the machinery was humbling. They were inside. Now for the hard part. Seri located a sign for a service stairwell, its universal stick-man figure a small beacon of hope in the industrial gloom. The lift would be useless, caught in the same temporal stutter as the floors above. It had to be the stairs. Forty-two floors up to the Skybridge.

The fire escape stairwell was a stark, concrete helix, lit by caged, yellow bulbs at each landing. It was eerily silent, the sounds of the machinery below fading as they began to climb. The air was stale and still. They took the stairs two at a time, their footfalls echoing in the confined space. For the first ten floors, the only challenge was the monotonous, burning climb. Then, on the landing of the eleventh floor, Seri felt it. A faint shimmer in the air, a tripwire of cheap magic stretched across the doorway. She stopped, holding a hand out to halt Bayang.

*What has an eye, but cannot see?* a disembodied, nasal voice whispered in the air around them. It was followed by the faint sound of a recorded golf clap.

Seri rolled her eyes. "A needle," she said flatly, stepping over the invisible line. The magic fizzled out with a pathetic sigh. It was a test. A ridiculously simple one. Jebat was getting arrogant. They continued their ascent, the burning in their calves intensifying. Twenty floors. Thirty. The air grew warmer, more humid. On the thirty-third floor, the trap was more elaborate. As they stepped onto the landing, the flight of stairs ahead of them seemed to stretch, the next landing receding into an impossible distance, like a cartoon character running in place. A low, magical chuckle, Jebat’s canned laughter, echoed around them.

Bayang let out a frustrated snarl, his claws scraping against the concrete. He hated illusions, things he couldn't bite or tear. Seri placed a calming hand on his flank. "It's not real, Bayang. He's just playing with perspective." She closed her eyes, not looking at the trick. Instead, she focused on the feel of the concrete under her feet, the cold metal of the handrail, the true, physical dimensions of the space. She took a step, then another. It felt like walking into a wall of invisible jelly, a strange, disorienting pressure pushing against her. But it was just a feeling. She kept walking, counting out the twenty-two steps she knew should be there. On the twenty-second step, her foot landed on solid ground. The illusion shattered with the sound of breaking glass, and the stairwell returned to its normal, grim proportions. The laughter track that followed sounded slightly more tinny this time, as if in disappointment.

They were getting close. Seri could feel the main body of Jebat's spell now, a throbbing, discordant hum that vibrated through the very structure of the tower. It was concentrated just above them. One more flight. Then another. Finally, they reached the door for the forty-second floor. It was unmarked, just a heavy steel fire door like all the others. But the air around it was thick with power, greasy and cloying, the magic practically dripping down the walls. This was it. The entrance to the Skybridge.

Seri took a deep breath, the air tasting of ozone and rotten fruit. She pushed the bar on the door. It swung open with a low groan, not into a brightly lit public corridor, but into an unnatural twilight. The storm raged outside the colossal windows, lightning momentarily illuminating a scene of chilling stillness. Tourists, families, and staff were scattered across the bridge, frozen mid-step, mid-laugh, mid-selfie. A child's balloon, shaped like a cartoon cat, hovered motionlessly an inch from the ceiling. A security guard was caught in the act of taking a sip from a water bottle, the stream of water a solid, unmoving arc between the bottle and his lips. The only sound was the distant howl of the wind and the insistent, pulsing hum of Jebat's spell, a monstrous heartbeat at the centre of the world’s most obnoxious joke. And there, shimmering in the middle of the bridge, right over the spell’s epicentre, was another illusion of Jebat, this one leaning casually against the air, examining his fingernails with an expression of profound boredom.The illusion of Jebat didn't turn. It simply manifested a new face on the back of its head which then turned to look at her, a grotesque and unnecessary flourish. The fedora remained stubbornly facing forward. "Well, well, well," the illusion drawled, its voice a slick veneer over a core of frantic neediness. "Look what the magical cat dragged in. I was beginning to think you'd gotten lost. Or decided to take up competitive riddle-solving. You have a knack for it, you know." The canned laughter echoed again, thin and pathetic against the genuine fury of the storm.

Seri ignored him, her feet making no sound as she stepped out onto the bridge proper. She walked past a man frozen with a camera to his eye, his face a mask of concentration on a moment that would now never be captured. The air was thick and heavy, like wading through invisible jelly. It hummed with the spell, a monotonous, off-key drone that set her teeth on edge. Bayang padded silently behind her, his body low to the ground. His golden eyes were not on the shimmering illusion of their tormentor, but on Seri, a silent question and an unwavering statement of support all at once. He was a panther in a cage of frozen moments, and his entire being radiated a coiled, predatory stillness that was the antithesis of the magical stasis around them.

*Like my work?* Jebat’s voice slid directly into her mind, bypassing the illusion. *It's a study in suspension. A monument to the moment. I call it 'KLCC-ze'. Get it? Seize?* He paused, as if waiting for a laugh that didn't come. *Tough crowd. Anyway, it’s my masterpiece. The largest temporal stasis field ever cast over a public landmark on a Tuesday.*

Seri finally reached the centre of the bridge, the very heart of the spell. It was just as she had imagined: a garish, pulsating carbuncle of magical energy clinging to the central support beam. It looked like a nest of tangled, multicoloured wires, all sparking and spitting erratically. Flashing neon pinks, sickly greens, and gaudy golds were all woven together with no sense of harmony or design. It was loud, inefficient, and desperately trying to look impressive. And threaded through the entire mess, like a dirty string holding it all together, was that signature energy of insecurity and cheap cologne. She could see now how he had done it. He hadn't created the loop from scratch; he had simply hijacked the natural resonant frequency of the bridge, the faint hum of a million daily crossings and a billion tonnes of steel, and twisted it, forcing it to repeat on a closed circuit. It was clever, in a brutish, shortcut-taking sort of way.

"You talk too much, Jebat," she said aloud, her voice calm and clear in the strange quiet. It was the first time she had acknowledged him. The illusion’s smug expression flickered, a momentary crack in the facade. She had touched a nerve. She reached out, not with her hand, but with her will, extending a single, pure thread of her own magic towards the pulsating knot. Her magic was the opposite of his; where his was a frantic, sparking tangle, hers was a clean, cool filament of light, the colour of twilight, smelling of wet stone and clean air. It touched the edge of his spell, and the chaotic energy recoiled with a hiss, like water on a hot pan.

*Hey! Watch the merchandise!* Jebat’s voice squawked in her head. *That’s a finely-tuned instrument of comedic chaos you’re messing with!*

She ignored him, pushing her magic deeper, not to break his spell, but to understand it. She felt for the source knot, the first lie he had told the bridge's essence to make it obey him. Bayang moved to stand between her and the rest of the bridge, a living shield of muscle and shadow, his gaze sweeping the frozen forms as if expecting one to spring to life. He trusted her to handle the magic; his job was to handle everything else. Seri found the knot. It was surprisingly simple, tied with the magical equivalent of a granny knot. All this flash, all this power, was built on a foundation of utter amateurism. With a focused thought, she began to gently pull at the thread.

The moment her magic began to unpick the knot, the illusion of Jebat held up a hand. A wide, manic grin spread across his face. "Ah, ah, ah," he chided, his voice dropping into a conspiratorial whisper that echoed all around the bridge. "You didn't ask for the punchline." The air grew colder. The low hum of the spell began to climb in pitch, becoming a high, keening whine. The chaotic energy of the spell wasn't dissipating as she unravelled it. It was being channelled. She had fallen for it. The pigeons, the riddles, the frozen bridge—it was all a container. A pressure cooker. And she had just turned the heat all the way up.

*What’s the problem with time-travel jokes?* Jebat’s voice boomed, dripping with triumph. *The delivery is always off!* The illusion snapped its fingers. The chaotic energy, no longer held in the loop, surged inwards, coalescing not on the bridge itself, but on the frozen people. The balloon in the child's hand suddenly withered, turning brown and brittle before crumbling to dust in an instant. The fresh, bright colours of a woman's floral-print blouse faded to a dusty grey. The security guard’s face, frozen in a moment of youthful concentration, was suddenly etched with lines, his dark hair visibly turning grey at the temples. Jebat wasn't just stopping time; he was hoarding it. And the punchline was to release all that stolen time, all those stolen moments, in a devastating, concentrated wave. He was going to age everyone on the bridge by decades in a matter of seconds.A primal scream tore through Seri’s mind, not from her own throat, but from the raw, violated fabric of reality itself. It was the sound of a thousand stolen seconds being cashed in at once. The rapid, horrifying decay had already begun. The young woman’s skin, moments ago smooth and vibrant in the lightning’s flash, lost its lustre, fine lines spiderwebbing from the corners of her eyes as her bright blouse faded to the colour of dust. The child’s unmoving balloon did not just crumble; it petrified, turning to a chalky substance that flaked away into nothingness. This wasn't a joke. This was a massacre measured in stolen years, a crime so profoundly cruel it transcended malice and entered the realm of the obscene.

There was no time to be clever. No time to unpick the knot. The only thing to do when a dam bursts is to become the new dam. In a single, fluid motion born of pure instinct, Seri’s body moved. She kicked off her worn sandals, her bare feet slapping against the cold, vibrating floor of the bridge, seeking a connection to the physical world, to the grounding earth so far below. Her hands slammed flat against the central support beam where the foul magic pulsed with malevolent glee, the chaotic energy buzzing against her palms like a nest of furious hornets. She closed her eyes, not to block out the sight, but to focus her every ounce of being on the task at hand. She would not let him have this.

A solid weight pressed into her back, a warm and living presence against the cold terror of the spell. Bayang. He wasn't just leaning; he was bracing her, his immense strength a physical and metaphysical anchor in the temporal storm. He let out a low, guttural rumble, a sound that was not a threat, but a promise of unyielding support. He was a creature of the now, of the endless, flowing present, and he offered that stability to her, a rock in a river of corrupted time. Seri opened herself up, not with the delicate precision she usually employed, but with a raw, desperate act of will. She stopped trying to untangle Jebat's spell and instead commanded it, her own magic a clarion call in the chaos: *Come to me.*

The torrent of stolen life hit her like a physical blow. It was not pain, but something worse, something more invasive. It was a billion mundane moments, a lifetime of discarded seconds, all forced into her consciousness at once. The sting of cheap office coffee on a tongue that wasn't hers. The phantom weight of a sleeping child on a shoulder. The sudden, dizzying love for a spouse captured in a frozen smile across the bridge. The bone-deep boredom of a long shift, the taste of a half-eaten sandwich, the lyrics to a song she had never heard. It was an assault of sensory data, a psychic drowning in the insignificant, stolen moments of dozens of strangers. Her body shuddered, her mind reeling under the onslaught of lived experiences that were not her own. Through it all, she held on, her bare feet on the floor, Bayang at her back, her hands pressed to the steel heart of the bridge, a living conduit for a storm of time.

The illusion of Jebat faltered, the smug grin wiped clean from its face, replaced by a flicker of disbelief, then outright shock. This wasn't the show he had planned. He had expected her to watch, horrified and helpless. He had orchestrated a performance of her failure. He never imagined she would leap onto the stage and swallow the explosion herself. The canned laughter in her head was gone, replaced by a fizz of static, a broadcast interrupted by an unexpected, incomprehensible event. He had lost control of his own punchline.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it was over. The high-pitched whine collapsed into silence. The thick, gelatinous air thinned, and sound rushed back in a deafening wave. The child, his balloon now gone, began to cry in confusion. The security guard choked, spilling water down the front of his now-pristine uniform. The tourists gasped, blinking, looking around as if waking from a dream, their phones still in their hands, their bodies suddenly in motion. The roar of the storm outside was once again just weather. The time loop was broken. The people were safe. Un-aged. Unharmed. Just bewildered.

Seri’s strength left her in a rush. She slid down the beam, her legs giving way, and crumpled to the floor. Her entire body trembled with a violent, uncontrollable tremor. Bayang was there instantly, moving to shield her from the waking crowd, nudging her face with his great head. As she pushed a shaking hand up to brush her hair from her eyes, she felt it. A single, stark white streak, the colour of bleached bone, now ran through her dark hair from root to tip, a permanent scar left by the temporal tide she had absorbed. The illusion of Jebat vanished not with a wink, but with an angry sizzle, like a bug hitting a zapper, leaving behind an aftertaste of pure, childish spite.

The tourists were beginning to panic now, the confusion giving way to fear at the sudden, inexplicable shift. Security would be here in moments. Seri pushed herself up, leaning heavily on Bayang. "Come on, big guy," she rasped, her voice hoarse, feeling as if she had lived a dozen lifetimes in the last thirty seconds. "Show's over." He nudged her face, his rough tongue a rasp against her cheek. She was his home. And someone had just tried to burn it down. The game was over. Now, it was a hunt.### Chapter 3

The frantic symphony of human panic erupted around them. A woman screamed, not in terror, but in sheer, grating confusion. A man shouted into his phone, his voice cracking, telling someone that the whole bridge had just "skipped". Emergency alarms, blessedly real and present, began to blare from the tower’s internal speakers, a strident counterpoint to the howling wind. Seri pushed herself upright, her muscles screaming in protest, her mind a swamp of borrowed memories and psychic exhaustion. Bayang was a wall of black muscle at her side, his low growl a perimeter of menace that kept the stumbling, bewildered crowd from jostling her. They had to leave, now, before the real security arrived, the kind that wouldn't be fooled by a "bad batch of sugar" explanation.

They couldn't go back down the stairs; they would meet the response teams on their way up. The lifts would be a chaotic trap. Seri’s eyes scanned the length of the bridge, past the frozen, terrified faces, and found what she was looking for: a small, square service panel in the glass wall, designed for a window-washing rig. It was their only way out. "The window," she rasped, her voice feeling alien in her own throat. Bayang understood immediately. While Seri fumbled with the panel’s heavy-duty latches, her fingers clumsy and weak, he created a subtle, silent diversion, a flicker of shadow at the far end of the bridge that drew the eyes of the nearest security guard for the crucial few seconds they needed. The panel swung inwards with a gust of wind and a spray of rain that felt like a slap in the face.

For a moment, Seri hesitated, looking out into the raging heart of the monsoon. Forty-two storeys up, the wind was a solid, malevolent force. Flying in this was madness. But staying was capture. She looked at Bayang, whose golden eyes held no fear, only resolve. He gave a short, sharp nod. It was enough. Taking a deep breath that did nothing to calm her racing heart, Seri launched herself out into the screaming void. Her wings, iridescent even in the stormy dark, snapped open, not to soar, but to fight. The wind snatched at her, trying to tear her away, to dash her against the cold glass and steel of the towers. It was less a flight and more a controlled plummet, a brutal battle for every inch of descent, her wings aching with a strain they were never designed for.

Bayang did not follow in flight. As Seri wrestled with the storm, he sprang from the opening with an impossible, terrifying grace. He landed silently on a narrow maintenance gantry a storey below, his claws finding purchase on the slick, wet metal where no normal creature could. He became a creature of the tower's skin, a waterfall of black muscle flowing down the skyscraper's face. He moved with a speed and certainty that defied gravity, leaping from ledge to beam to conduit, a phantom using the architecture of the city as his personal jungle gym. He kept pace with Seri’s brutal descent, a guardian shadow racing her to the ground. They met in the drenched, windswept darkness of KLCC park, landing in a tangle of limbs and exhaustion behind a large, concrete water feature, safely out of sight of the swarm of emergency vehicles now converging on the tower's main entrance.

The adrenaline that had sustained Seri evaporated, and a wave of profound weakness washed over her, so absolute it felt like she was dissolving in the rain. Her legs buckled, and she would have collapsed onto the muddy ground if Bayang hadn’t moved to buttress her, his solid, warm body a living crutch. The world swam in a grey haze, and the phantom sensations returned: the taste of someone else's fear, the echo of a stranger's prayer, the sudden, jarring memory of a childhood birthday party in a house she’d never seen. She had absorbed the temporal shockwave, but the shrapnel of stolen lives was now embedded in her soul. Bayang nudged her insistently, his head pressing against her cheek, his message clear. *Not here. We must go.* Leaning on him, her small frame dwarfed by his power, they melted back into the shadows, leaving the chaos of the towers behind them.

The journey back to their rooftop perch in Pudu was a slow, grim pilgrimage. Every step was an effort of will. The rain had lessened to a persistent, miserable drizzle that slicked the streets and chilled her to the bone. The usual vibrant energy of Kuala Lumpur felt muted, the neon lights of Bukit Bintang bleeding into hazy reflections on the wet pavement, the city’s heartbeat seeming to falter with her own. They were two wounded creatures moving through a world that was suddenly alien. Bayang stayed close, a constant, reassuring pressure against her side, guarding her not just from physical threats, but from the swirling eddies of her own fractured thoughts. The hunt could wait. First, there had to be sanctuary.

When they finally reached the crumbling cornice of the pre-war shophouse, Seri collapsed. She didn't have the energy to arrange herself gracefully, she simply folded, her soaked jeans and t-shirt instantly dark against the weathered tiles. The soupy air, which had felt so oppressive hours before, was now a familiar blanket. Bayang curled his large body around her, shielding her from the wind, his deep, rhythmic breathing a calming presence in the sudden, profound silence. He laid his head on his paws, but his eyes never closed. He watched over her, a sinuous guardian of black muscle and ancient loyalty, as the city lights shimmered and the last of the storm clouds passed overhead, revealing a sky scrubbed clean and studded with watery stars.

After a long time, Seri stirred. The worst of the trembling had subsided. She sat up slowly, her whole body aching as if she’d been in a fight. Her hand went to her head, brushing the wet hair from her face, and her fingers found the alien texture. The white streak. It felt different from the rest of her hair, coarser, colder, utterly devoid of life. As she touched it, a faint echo of the temporal assault pulsed through her, a ghost of the psychic noise she had absorbed. It was a scar, a brand marking her sacrifice. But as she focused on it, pushing past the pain and the memory of violation, she found something else. A thread. It was the residue of Jebat’s magic, the core of his intent, which she had pulled into herself along with all those stolen moments. It was no longer a vague scent of cheap cologne in the air; it was a tangible connection, a filament of foul energy woven into her very being.

She closed her eyes, letting the sounds of the waking city—the first LRT train of the morning, the distant clatter of a restaurant opening—fade into the background. She followed the thread. It was like tuning a radio, turning the dial past the static of a million other magical signatures until she found his specific, obnoxious frequency. He had been so arrogant, so sure of his own cleverness and her predictability, that he had never considered this possibility. He never imagined she would internalize his spell, take his weapon and make it a compass. The thread led away from the glittering modernity of KLCC, away from the tourist traps of Jalan Alor, and deep into the tangled, older heart of the city. It led towards Chow Kit, a place of chaotic markets, shadowed histories, and forgotten magic. He was hiding there, somewhere flashy and hollow, thinking he had won.

A cold, hard clarity settled over Seri. The exhaustion was still there, a deep ache in her bones, but it had been transmuted into fuel. She pushed herself to her feet, her movements no longer weak, but deliberate and precise. The city was laid out before them, a sprawling map of light and shadow under the pale dawn sky. She looked down at Bayang, who had risen with her in a single, fluid motion. The look that passed between them needed no words. The game was over. The rules had been broken. This was no longer about cleaning up a magical mess. This was about settling a debt. "I know where he is," she said, her voice a low, steady thing, as cold and unyielding as the stone of the Batu Caves. Bayang’s golden eyes burned with a feral, intelligent light. He let out a soft chuff of air, a puff of smoke in the cool morning, an answer that was both a question and a vow. *Then let us go.*The grey light of dawn was a merciless thing. It painted the city in shades of slate and ash, revealing the grime in every corner, the weariness on the faces of the early commuters. On the rooftop, Seri did not move for a long time. She sat with her legs crossed, her back straight, a posture of meditation that belied the storm raging within her. The psychic shrapnel of the stolen moments still skittered at the edges of her awareness, threatening to pull her under. She focused not on silencing them, but on the single, alien thread of white in her hair. It was a foreign object in the landscape of her self, a splinter of Jebat’s arrogant magic lodged deep. With a slow, deliberate breath that tasted of the city’s morning dampness, she stopped fighting the connection and instead opened herself to it, turning the lock into a key. The phantom memories did not vanish, but they quieted, falling into a hum behind the one clear, resonant note of her target. It was a signal of pure, unadulterated ego, pulsing like a neon sign in a dark alley.

They left their perch not with a leap, but with a silent, methodical descent down a rusted fire escape that shuddered under Bayang’s weight. The city was yawning itself awake around them. The scent of fresh bao steaming in bamboo baskets and the rich, nutty aroma of coffee from a kopitiam drifted up from the streets below. They moved through this waking world like phantoms, sticking to the liminal spaces the city provided. They followed the longkang, the deep concrete storm drains that were the city's secret highways, their path hidden from the traffic that was already beginning to clog the main roads. Bayang moved with a predator’s economy, his paws making no sound on the damp concrete, while Seri, her wings folded tight, became just another small, hurried figure in the urban landscape, unremarkable and therefore invisible. They were a knife sliding between the city's ribs, and the city, in its morning rush, never even felt the blade.

The thread of magic pulled them relentlessly north, out of the familiar territory of Pudu and into the dense, chaotic heart of Chow Kit. The air here was different, thicker, layered with a thousand more smells and sounds. They emerged from a covered drain into the visceral chaos of the Bazaar Baru Chow Kit. It was a sensory assault. The air was heavy with the coppery tang of freshly butchered meat, the sharp, oceanic scent of fish laid out on beds of ice, the earthy perfume of dirt-caked vegetables, and the sweet, almost dizzying aroma of a hundred different spices. The noise was a tapestry of haggling voices, the rhythmic thud of cleavers, the screech of wheeled carts, and the incessant crowing of roosters in wooden cages. This was a place of raw, unfiltered life, a stark contrast to the sterile, curated perfection of KLCC. It was a place where things, and people, could easily get lost.

Jebat’s magical signature, however, was impossible to lose. It was a gaudy, foul note in the market’s complex symphony. The thread led them past stalls selling counterfeit watches and luridly coloured textiles, away from the raw energy of the wet market, and towards a grimy, four-storey building wedged between a wholesale electronics supplier and a tired-looking budget hotel. The ground floor was a snooker hall, already half-full despite the early hour, smelling of stale cigarette smoke and desperation. But the signal wasn't coming from there. It was coming from the very top floor, from behind windows plastered with peeling, sun-faded posters of smiling, airbrushed pop stars. A flickering neon sign, with two of its letters dead, announced the establishment: ‘Sta light Sup rstar KTV’. It was perfect. A place of manufactured joy and hollow echoes, a temple to cheap glamour. It was so completely, pathetically Jebat.

Ignoring the dubious-looking main entrance, they slipped into a side alley choked with overflowing grease traps and stacks of empty beer crates. A rusted metal staircase clung to the side of the building, leading up to a service door for the karaoke lounge. As Seri placed her hand on the railing, she felt a final, petty ward. A tingling, juvenile spell designed to startle, not to harm. She didn't bother to unpick it. Instead, she let Bayang go first. He placed a heavy paw on the first step, and a ridiculously loud, magically amplified fart noise echoed through the alley, followed by a chorus of tiny, recorded giggles. Bayang didn't even flinch. He simply continued his ascent, his expression one of profound, granite-faced contempt. The spell, having failed to get a rise out of its first victim, fizzled out with a pathetic whimper. Seri followed, her face a mask of cold fury. The pranks, the riddles, the sheer, infuriating childishness of it all had burned away everything but the icy core of her resolve.

At the top of the stairs, they reached a heavy, padded fire door, the source of the magical signal pulsing strongly from the other side. Seri paused, her hand hovering over the handle. There were no sounds of a party, no frantic spellcasting. From within, she could faintly hear the tinny, repetitive jingle of a video game and a low, irritated muttering. He was in there, hiding in his tacky palace, nursing his wounded pride after she had ruined his grand finale. He thought he was the victor, that he had scarred her and gotten away. He didn't know that the scar he’d left was a leash, and she had followed it all the way home. Bayang pressed against her leg, a low growl vibrating deep in his chest, a promise of the violence to come. Seri took a slow, steadying breath, the air tasting of rust and rain. She placed her hand on the door, and pushed.### Chapter 4

The door swung inward with a sad, pneumatic sigh, the sound swallowed by the garish interior. The main lounge of the ‘Starlight Superstar KTV’ was a temple to tackiness, a windowless cavern steeped in the smell of stale cigarette smoke, spilled beer, and the cloying sweetness of a cherry-scented air freshener that had long since given up the fight. A cheap disco ball turned lazily on the ceiling, dappling the peeling vinyl booths and sticky-looking floor with pathetic spots of light. The only major source of illumination was a massive flat-screen television, upon which a brightly coloured cartoon knight was repeatedly failing to jump over a pit of lava. The air hummed with the electronic jingle of failure and the low, frustrated muttering of the room's sole occupant.

Jebat was slumped on a red faux-leather sofa that had more cracks than surface. He was still wearing the absurd hibiscus shirt and the fedora, but in the sad glow of the video game, they looked less like a costume and more like a cry for help. A half-eaten bag of prawn crackers lay open on his chest, and a game controller was clutched in his hands. He didn't notice them at first, too engrossed in his digital failure. It was Bayang’s presence that registered first, a sudden drop in temperature, a thickening of the shadows in the corner of his eye. Jebat’s head snapped up, and for a split second, his face was a blank canvas of pure, unadulterated shock. The controller clattered to the floor. The smarm, the arrogance, the entire carefully constructed persona of the magical heckler dissolved in an instant, revealing the pale, frightened man underneath.

He scrambled backwards on the sofa, his eyes wide, flicking between the cold fury on Seri’s face and the liquid menace that was Bayang, who had begun a slow, deliberate patrol of the room’s perimeter. The puma’s paws made no sound on the grimy floor, his movements a terrifying ballet of predatory grace. He was cutting off every exit, his golden eyes burning with a light that promised retribution. Jebat swallowed, his bravado returning in a desperate, shaky wave. "Seri! What a surprise," he stammered, forcing a laugh that sounded like tearing cardboard. "I was just, uh, testing the local entertainment infrastructure. The latency on this thing is a joke. You here for a duet? I do a killer 'My Way'."

Seri did not answer. She took a slow step forward, then another, her wet clothes dripping onto the floor, each drop seeming to hiss on the foul carpet. Her exhaustion was a visible cloak around her shoulders, but it only amplified the chilling intensity in her eyes. She raised a hand, her fingers trembling slightly, and brushed them against the stark white streak in her hair. She held his gaze as she did it, letting him see the scar, the brand, the piece of him that was now a piece of her. "You left a trail, Jebat," she said, her voice quiet, yet it cut through the room's stale air like a shard of glass. "You were so proud of your work, you signed your name all over it. You signed it on me."

The meaning dawned on him, and a new, more profound terror bloomed on his face. He had been found not through tracking spells or scrying pools, but through a fundamental flaw in his own magic, a flaw born of his desperate need to leave a mark. His greatest prank had turned into a permanent, undeniable connection to the one person he never wanted to face. He was no longer the unseen puppeteer; he was tethered to the puppet. The man who lived for the cheap seats had been dragged onto the stage, and the spotlight was burning him alive. His face, already pale, turned the colour of old parchment.

Panic finally overwhelmed him. With a yelp, he flung a hand out, not in a grand gesture, but a desperate, clumsy flick of the wrist. A wave of his garish, sloppy magic erupted into the room. It was an attack of pure annoyance. The karaoke microphones in their wall holsters began to screech feedback, the television switched to a loop of a laughing clown, and a cloud of shimmering, illusory butterflies burst from the disco ball, fluttering distractingly around the room. It was the magical equivalent of throwing sand in someone’s eyes, a coward’s final, pathetic act of defiance. It was a tantrum, not a spell.

The flimsy magic was no deterrent. Bayang met the cloud of butterflies with a contemptuous snarl, his roar a deep, primal sound that came from the very heart of the ancient world. The sound wave alone shattered the illusion, the shimmering insects dissolving into motes of panicked light. He leapt onto a low table laden with dirty glasses, sending them crashing to the floor, his eyes fixed on Jebat with an intensity that promised a violent, physical conclusion. The sight of the enraged puma, a creature of pure, unadulterated reality, caused Jebat’s magical tantrum to stutter and fail. The screeching feedback died, the laughing clown vanished, and the room was left once more in the grim, quiet glow of the KTV’s standby lights.

In that moment of distraction, Seri closed the final few feet between them. Jebat flinched back as she approached, trying to press himself into the very vinyl of the sofa. He threw up his hands as if to ward her off, a faint, sickly green light flickering around his palms. But Seri didn't strike. She didn’t cast a counter-spell. She simply reached out and placed her hand flat against his chest, right over his hammering heart. Through the thread of his magic that was now woven into her, she didn't push or blast. She pulled. It was a quiet, intimate, and utterly devastating act. Jebat gasped, his eyes widening in horror, not from pain, but from a terrifying sense of emptiness. He felt his magic, his connection to the chaotic, vibrant energy he twisted for his own amusement, being drawn out of him, siphoned away through the link he himself had created. It flowed into Seri, not to empower her, but simply to be held, contained, and neutralized within the stillness she had learned in the shadow of the Batu Caves.

The process took only a few seconds, but for Jebat, it was an eternity of loss. The sickly green light around his hands flickered and died. The lingering scent of cheap cologne and rotting fruit that clung to his magical signature faded into nothing. When Seri finally pulled her hand away, he was left utterly vacant, a hollowed-out man slumped in a cheap karaoke lounge. He was still Jebat, but the spark, the irritating, chaotic magic that was his entire identity, was gone. He was just a man in a loud shirt, his greatest weapon now just a memory. Seri looked down at him, her expression not one of triumph, but of weary finality. "No more jokes, Jebat," she whispered. She turned her back on him and walked towards the door, the psychic noise in her own mind finally, mercifully silent. Bayang gave the powerless man one last look of utter disdain before padding silently after her. They left him there, in his silent, tacky palace, a heckler with no voice, a performer with no act, doomed to a life of profound and utter mundanity. As they stepped back out into the bright, unforgiving morning of Chow Kit, the first true rays of sun broke through the clouds, and the city, for the first time all night, felt clean.The door swung inward with a sad, pneumatic sigh, the sound swallowed by the garish interior.

As they stepped back out into the bright, unforgiving morning of Chow Kit, the first true rays of sun broke through the clouds, and the city, for the first time all night, felt clean.### Chapter 5

The alley spit them out into the full, unapologetic glare of the Kuala Lumpur morning. The sun, having vanquished the storm, now beat down on the city, turning the wet pavement into a steaming mirror and making the vibrant colours of the Chow Kit market seem almost painfully bright. The air was no longer a soupy cocktail of fumes and rain, but a cleaner, sharper mix of diesel, frying garlic, and the distant, sweet scent of temple incense. For Seri, the sensory clarity was a shock. The chaotic hum of a thousand borrowed lives was gone from her mind, leaving behind a silence so profound it was almost a sound in itself. The world felt crisp, freshly rendered, and utterly exhausting to behold. She felt scoured clean, hollowed out, and profoundly tired, the kind of bone-deep weariness that sleep alone could not cure.

Their journey back to Pudu was a slow retreat through a city that was now fully alive and utterly oblivious to the silent war that had been waged in its heart. They could not use the secret highways of the storm drains, now bustling with the runoff from the downpour, so they walked. Seri, small and unassuming in her damp, plain clothes, was just another face in the river of humanity flowing along the five-foot ways. She kept her head down, her gaze fixed on the cracked pavement, letting the crowd's momentum carry her along. Bayang moved through a parallel world just a few feet away, a ghost in the morning sun. He flowed through the narrow gaps between parked cars, slunk behind the broad pillars of the monorail line, and used the brief, deep shadows cast by delivery lorries as temporary pockets of invisibility. Pedestrians would sometimes shiver as he passed, a sudden inexplicable chill on a hot morning, but no one ever saw him. They met at intersections, a fleeting exchange of glances, before melting back into their separate streams.

During the long walk, Seri’s hand kept drifting unconsciously to the white streak in her hair. It no longer felt like a foreign object, a parasitic thread. The connection was gone, the leash cut. Now, it was just a part of her, a scar tissue of the soul made manifest. It did not hum with stolen power or echo with another’s pain; it was simply a quiet, indelible reminder of the price. The price of being the one who cleans up, the one who stands in the path of the flood. She had taken Jebat’s magic, his very essence, into herself and neutralized it. The act had left her empty, but it had also left her clean. The memories of the people on the bridge were fading, no longer an invasive assault but a distant, sorrowful echo, like a song half-remembered from a dream. She had held their stolen time, and in returning it, had paid a small piece of her own.

When they finally reached the familiar, crumbling facade of their shophouse, the climb up the fire escape felt like scaling a mountain. Every step was a negotiation between will and gravity. Bayang went ahead, waiting for her on each landing, a silent, patient sentinel. When she at last hauled herself over the cornice and onto the sun-warmed tiles of their rooftop sanctuary, the strength that had carried her this far deserted her completely. She sank to the ground, her back against the warm brick of a chimney stack, and closed her eyes against the brilliant blue sky. The city stretched out before her, its roar now a familiar, almost comforting drone. The bruised purple clouds were gone, the air was fit to breathe, and the Petronas Towers once again stood as silent, silver monuments, their brief, bizarre history already being dismissed by thousands as a strange power surge or a mass hallucination.

Bayang padded over and settled beside her, not curled around her this time, but lying parallel, a solid line of warmth and presence. He rested his heavy head on her lap, a gesture of profound trust and comfort. His golden eyes, ancient and knowing, watched the city below, but his attention was entirely on her. He was her anchor, her silence, her muscle. She was his home. Seri’s hand came to rest on his head, her fingers stroking the space between his ears. She felt the steady, powerful beat of his heart through her own tired body. She had absorbed a storm and he had been the lightning rod that kept her from being consumed by it. Without him, she would have been torn apart by the psychic backlash, another piece of debris in Jebat's pathetic hurricane.

She took a slow breath, and for the first time, extended a tiny, tentative thread of her own magic. It unfurled from her like a clean silver ribbon, pure and quiet, tasting of rain and limestone. It was not diminished. If anything, it felt clearer, more focused, stripped of any lingering dissonance. The wellspring of her power was deep and untroubled. The cost of the night had not been to her magic, but to her self. A few years off her life, perhaps, condensed into a single white streak. A fair trade, she thought, for all the years she had saved on that bridge. She let the thread of magic dissolve and simply sat, her hand on Bayang's head, watching the day unfold over Kuala Lumpur. The game was over. The board was clear. For now. But Seri Bintang knew her city. There were other players, other games. Rifts that tore open reality, ancient spirits that woke in forgotten places, and petty sorcerers with fragile egos. For now, there was the sun on her face and the steady weight of her companion in her lap. For now, there was peace. And for today, that was enough.The alley spit them out into the full, unapologetic glare of the Kuala Lumpur morning.

Pedestrians would sometimes shiver as he passed, a sudden inexplicable chill on a hot morning, but no one ever saw him. They met at intersections, a fleeting exchange of glances, before melting back into their separate streams.

During the long walk, Seri’s hand kept drifting unconsciously to the white streak in her hair. It no longer felt like a foreign object, a parasitic thread. The connection was gone, the leash cut. Now, it was just a part of her, a scar tissue of the soul made manifest. It did not hum with stolen power or echo with another’s pain; it was simply a quiet, indelible reminder of the price. The price of being the one who cleans up, the one who stands in the path of the flood. She had taken Jebat’s magic, his very essence, into herself and neutralized it. The act had left her empty, but it had also left her clean. The memories of the people on the bridge were fading, no longer an invasive assault but a distant, sorrowful echo, like a song half-remembered from a dream. She had held their stolen time, and in returning it, had paid a small piece of her own.

When they finally reached the familiar, crumbling facade of their shophouse, the climb up the fire escape felt like scaling a mountain. Every step was a negotiation between will and gravity. Bayang went ahead, waiting for her on each landing, a silent, patient sentinel. When she at last hauled herself over the cornice and onto the sun-warmed tiles of their rooftop sanctuary, the strength that had carried her this far deserted her completely. She sank to the ground, her back against the warm brick of a chimney stack, and closed her eyes against the brilliant blue sky. The city stretched out before her, its roar now a familiar, almost comforting drone. The bruised purple clouds were gone, the air was fit to breathe, and the Petronas Towers once again stood as silent, silver monuments, their brief, bizarre history already being dismissed by thousands as a strange power surge or a mass hallucination.

Bayang padded over and settled beside her, not curled around her this time, but lying parallel, a solid line of warmth and presence. He rested his heavy head on her lap, a gesture of profound trust and comfort. His golden eyes, ancient and knowing, watched the city below, but his attention was entirely on her. He was her anchor, her silence, her muscle. She was his home. Seri’s hand came to rest on his head, her fingers stroking the space between his ears. She felt the steady, powerful beat of his heart through her own tired body. She had absorbed a storm and he had been the lightning rod that kept her from being consumed by it. Without him, she would have been torn apart by the psychic backlash, another piece of debris in Jebat's pathetic hurricane.

She took a slow breath, and for the first time, extended a tiny, tentative thread of her own magic. It unfurled from her like a clean silver ribbon, pure and quiet, tasting of rain and limestone. It was not diminished. If anything, it felt clearer, more focused, stripped of any lingering dissonance. The wellspring of her power was deep and untroubled. The cost of the night had not been to her magic, but to her self. A few years off her life, perhaps, condensed into a single white streak. A fair trade, she thought, for all the years she had saved on that bridge. She let the thread of magic dissolve and simply sat, her hand on Bayang's head, watching the day unfold over Kuala Lumpur. The game was over. The board was clear. For now. But Seri Bintang knew her city. There were other players, other games. Rifts that tore open reality, ancient spirits that woke in forgotten places, and petty sorcerers with fragile egos. For now, there was the sun on her face and the steady weight of her companion in her lap. For now, there was peace. And for today, that was enough.The sun climbed higher, a merciless eye in the cloudless sky, and the rooftop tiles began to radiate a fierce, dry heat. Seri finally stirred from her semi-conscious state, the warmth seeping into her aching bones. She felt brittle, like a piece of glass that had survived a great impact but was now riddled with a thousand invisible fractures, ready to shatter at the next shock. The silence in her mind was the most jarring part. For years, she had lived with the constant, low-grade static of Kuala Lumpur's chaotic energy, a hum she had learned to filter and navigate. Now, after the violent psychic purge of Jebat's magic, that hum was gone, leaving a void so complete it felt like a form of deafness. She felt unmoored, a ship without the familiar press of the water against its hull. Bayang lifted his head from her lap, his golden eyes blinking slowly in the bright light. He nudged her hand, a soft, questioning gesture, then looked pointedly towards the edge of the roof and the street below. The message was clear. Sustenance. The mortal body, even one threaded with the magic of her lineage, had its mundane, non-negotiable demands.

They descended into the vibrant, noisy embrace of Pudu. The glare of the sun was softened here by the shadows of the old shophouses and the colourful awnings of the street vendors. The air was thick with the scent of roasted chestnuts, the sharp tang of freshly juiced sugarcane, and the comforting, savoury aroma of chicken rice. They slipped into the back of a bustling kopitiam, a place of formica-topped tables, endlessly spinning ceiling fans, and the familiar clatter of ceramic bowls and stainless steel spoons. Seri chose a small table in a dim corner, a spot that allowed her to see the entrance while remaining part of the shadows. She ordered a bowl of soupy pan mee and a glass of Kopi O kosong, black and bitter. Bayang settled under the table, a pool of darkness that went unnoticed by the harried waiters and the patrons engrossed in their newspapers and conversations. This was their ritual, a small anchor of normalcy in a life that was anything but.

As she tore pieces of chili padi into her soup, her attention was caught by the screen of a smartphone held by a man at the next table. He was watching a news report, the sound tinny and urgent. The chyron read: ‘KLCC FREAK ELECTRICAL SURGE CAUSES MASS CONFUSION’. A serious-looking reporter stood in the still-damp KLCC park, the Petronas Towers gleaming innocently behind her. She spoke of a "complex cascade failure in the backup power systems," which, combined with the atmospheric pressure of the storm, had allegedly created a "localized psycho-acoustic phenomenon" leading to temporal disorientation and shared mild hallucinations among those on the Skybridge. Experts in crisp lab coats were interviewed, speaking soberly about electromagnetic fields and the suggestibility of the human mind under stress. The man watching the video shook his head and muttered "Aiyo, what nonsense," before going back to his wan tan mee.

Seri took a slow sip of her coffee, the bitter liquid a welcome shock to her system. It was always like this. The mundane world would produce any explanation, no matter how ludicrous, to avoid confronting the truth that lay just beneath its skin. Psycho-acoustic phenomenon. It was a phrase as clumsy and desperate as one of Jebat’s puns. She had absorbed the stolen lives of a hundred people, carried a storm of corrupted time within her own body, and stripped a man of his very soul, and the official record would call it a power surge. A part of her should have been relieved, grateful for the neatly constructed lie that kept her world hidden. Instead, she felt a profound sense of alienation, a gulf between her reality and theirs that had never seemed so wide. She looked down at Bayang, who met her gaze with his ancient, knowing eyes. He had seen empires rise and fall in his own world; the transient explanations of short-lived mortals were less than noise to him. He was her only anchor to the truth, the only other witness who knew the real name of the storm.### Chapter 6

She finished the last of the noodles, the heat of the soup a welcome fire in her hollowed-out core. The uncle who ran the kopitiam shuffled over to clear the table, his movements practiced and economical. He glanced at the white streak in her hair, his gaze lingering for just a second before he dismissed it, his mind already on the next order, the next customer, the endless rhythm of his life. To him, it was just a style, a quirk, another small, inexplicable detail in a city full of them. The profound chasm between their realities had never felt deeper. She paid for her meal with a few worn ringgit notes, the simple, mundane transaction feeling strangely theatrical, like she was an actress playing the part of a normal person. As she stepped back out into the street, the world felt too loud, too bright, its colours almost aggressive in their vibrancy, a stark contrast to the muted grey of her own exhaustion.

The walk back was a slow, deliberate trudge through the furnace of the afternoon. The city’s chaotic energy, which she had once navigated as intuitively as a fish in water, now beat against her like a physical force. The roar of traffic, the cacophony of a hundred different conversations, the blare of a distant car horn—it was all just noise, unfiltered and overwhelming. She felt like a stranger in her own skin, a tourist in her own home. Bayang was her only true landmark in this suddenly alien landscape. He paced her from the shadows of the monorail pillars, a constant, silent presence that was the only thing keeping her grounded. He was the only part of this world that still made sense, the one being who saw her not as a tired girl with a strange streak in her hair, but for exactly what she was: wounded, but whole.

Back on the rooftop, their sanctuary felt different. The familiar space, usually a refuge, now seemed exposed, the vast, open sky a heavy weight above her. She sat, not to meditate or center herself, but because her legs would no longer hold her. She tried to reach for the quiet center within herself, the place of limestone and rain where her power resided, but her internal landscape was a foreign country. The silence Jebat’s absence had left was not peaceful; it was a vacuum, a sensory void that left her feeling disoriented and adrift. It was the silence of a house after a death, a stillness that was louder and more unsettling than any noise. She was unmoored, and she did not know how to find her way back to shore.

Bayang, sensing her drift into the grey wastes of her own mind, did not offer a comforting nudge. Instead, he began a ritual as old as his own ancient lineage. He sat a few feet from her, turned his back, and began to groom himself with a meticulous, all-consuming focus. The sound was a soft, rough rasping as his tongue worked through his dark coat, a rhythmic, steady sound that was the antithesis of the city’s chaos. The methodical sweep of his paw over his ear, the deep, contented rumble in his chest, the sheer, grounded animal presence of him—it was an anchor thrown from the world of the real. Seri found her gaze drawn to the simple, profound act. She let the rhythm of it wash over her, a new kind of metronome for her scattered thoughts. She breathed in time with the rasp of his tongue, her focus narrowing from the overwhelming city to this one small, perfect circle of existence.

Slowly, as she anchored herself to the simple reality of her companion, the vacuum in her mind began to change. The unnerving silence was not empty, she realized, but simply clear. For years, Jebat’s noisy, needy magic had been a constant background hiss in the psychic spectrum of the city, a pollutant she had grown so used to she had forgotten what true quiet sounded like. Now, with him gone, the air was clean. And in that pristine quiet, she began to hear something else. It was incredibly faint, a sound she would have missed a day ago, buried as it would have been under all the other magical static. It wasn't a signature like Jebat's, not a broadcast of ego and intent. It was a bass note, a deep, sorrowful hum that seemed to rise from the very earth beneath the concrete.

It was not a hostile sound, but it was one of immense, ancient pain. It pulsed with the slow, mournful rhythm of a slumbering heart that had been violently disturbed. Seri lifted her head, her gaze turning eastward, toward the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers, the muddy, sacred ground where the city had been born. The temporal shockwave, the punchline to Jebat’s cruel joke, had not just vanished. It had struck the earth, a psychic depth charge dropped into the deep, forgotten waters of the land’s own magic. It had woken something up. Or, at least, it had made it cry out in its sleep. Bayang suddenly stopped grooming, his head snapping up, his ears swiveling to track the same unseen source. His body went tense, a low growl vibrating in his throat, a sound not of aggression, but of deep, instinctual concern. He looked from the direction of the river back to Seri, and in his golden eyes, she saw the silent, shared understanding. The last mess was cleaned up. A new, far older one was just beginning to stir.The deep, sorrowful hum was nothing like Jebat’s magic. His had been a frantic, needy screech, a firecracker demanding attention. This was the opposite. It was a bass note that resonated not in the air, but in bone and stone. It was the sound of a great weight settling, of a deep wound groaning under the pressure of the city built on top of it. It pulsed with a slow, mournful rhythm, the beat of a heart the size of a hill, troubled in its ancient slumber. Seri felt it in the soles of her feet, a vibration that travelled up the concrete skeleton of the shophouse from the deep, damp earth below. It was a magic made of memory and mud, of forgotten riverbeds and primeval forests paved over but never truly erased. Jebat’s prank, in its temporal violence, had been like a lightning strike on a still lake, the shockwave travelling down to disturb the silt and sediment of a thousand years, stirring something that had been content to dream.

The unnerving quiet in Seri’s mind, the vacuum left by Jebat’s absence, was now filled by this single, profound vibration. It was not a violation, but it was a summons. It pulled at her, a low, constant pressure against her senses, a call to a duty she had not chosen but had inherited. The exhaustion that had settled into her bones like a fine dust was still there, but now it was overlaid with a new, grim tension. Her brief, hard-won peace had been a mirage. Her hand, which had been stroking Bayang’s head, clenched into a fist in his thick fur. The white streak in her hair seemed to thrum with a faint, sympathetic energy, the scar from the last battle now an antenna for the next. She was a physician who had just finished a brutal, twenty-four-hour shift only to hear a code blue called for the hospital's very foundations. There was no choice but to answer.

Bayang was on his feet in a single, silent motion. The weary comfort he had offered was gone, replaced by a taut, alert posture that spoke of a deep and instinctual wrongness. This was not the contained fury he had shown for Jebat; this was a more profound disturbance, the kind a creature of the wild feels when the earth itself is sick. He did not look for a single enemy or a point of attack. He paced the edge of the roof, his head low, his nostrils flaring as if he could taste the pain in the air. His gaze was fixed eastward, towards the glittering spires of the Masjid Jamek, a landmark that marked the sacred, muddy confluence where the city’s lifeblood flowed. He was a creature of the natural world, a being of instinct and ancient cycles, and the lament rising from the earth was a desecration he could feel in his very being. He stopped his pacing and looked back at her, his golden eyes burning with a silent, urgent question that she already knew the answer to.

"It's the river," Seri whispered, her voice rough with fatigue. "He didn't just break the time on the bridge. The backlash… it hit the confluence. The genius loci." She spoke the old term without thinking, the name for the spirit of a place, a concept most modern magic-users dismissed as folklore. But Kuala Lumpur, the "muddy confluence," had been born from that specific point, and its spirit, though buried and dormant, was ancient and powerful. It was not angry or malevolent. It was wounded, confused, shaken from a dream of centuries by a blast of temporal chaos it could not comprehend. And its pain was beginning to bleed into the city itself, a slow, subtle poisoning from the ground up.

There was no discussion, no weighing of options. Some things simply were. The sun was beginning its slow descent, painting the undersides of the few remaining clouds in hues of orange and rose. The golden hour was approaching, that magical, liminal time when the veil between worlds grew thin. It was the best time, and the worst, to be doing this. With a groan that was part human, part ancient weariness, Seri pushed herself to her feet. The city unfolded below them, its familiar chaos now underscored by the deep, sorrowful hum only they could perceive. Bayang moved to her side, a solid, reassuring presence. They stood together on the rooftop, two solitary figures against the sprawling backdrop of the city, a girl marked by a battle with time and a beast from another world, their brief respite over, their next duty already laid out before them. They had to go to the river. They had to see what had woken up.### Chapter 6

The descent from the rooftop was a slow, deliberate act of will. The golden hour, which usually painted the city in soft, forgiving light, seemed to mock Seri with its beauty. Each sunbeam felt like a spotlight on her exhaustion, each long shadow a reminder of the creeping darkness within the land itself. They did not run or melt through the back alleys this time. Seri, with a weariness that went beyond her aching muscles, decided on the most mundane, most human form of transport. They took the LRT. Standing on the crowded platform at the Pudu station, she was just another tired face in the evening commute, her extraordinary nature hidden by a cloak of absolute normality. No one looked twice at the small, pale girl in jeans and a t-shirt, though they gave a wide berth to the empty space at her side where Bayang stood, a pocket of invisible cold in the humid station air. The train car was a capsule of shared, low-grade melancholy. A baby that should have been crying stared blankly at the flickering lights; a group of teenagers scrolled silently through their phones, their usual boisterous energy absent; a man in a business suit sighed, a sound of profound, existential weariness that had nothing to do with his day at the office. The city’s inhabitants were feeling the effects, a subtle emotional poisoning they would blame on the heat, the traffic, or a bad day, never knowing its true, subterranean source.

As the train rattled and swayed on its elevated track, carving a path through the heart of the city, Seri felt the deep hum grow stronger. It was a physical pressure now, a weight against her sternum that made each breath a conscious effort. She gripped a handrail, her knuckles white, as a wave of dizziness washed over her, the motion of the train momentarily syncing with the slow, sorrowful pulse from the earth. The world outside the window seemed to shimmer, the hard edges of the buildings momentarily losing their focus. Bayang pressed his solid weight against her leg, a silent, grounding force that was the only thing keeping her upright. He did not need to see the world flicker to know it was breaking. He could feel the growing instability in the very air they moved through, a fundamental wrongness that set the ancient instincts of his soul on edge. His presence was a quiet, unyielding promise: wherever this path led, she would not walk it alone. They were a dyad, a two-part solution to a problem that was growing larger and more complex by the second.

They alighted at Masjid Jamek, stepping out into the very epicentre of the disturbance. The beautiful, Moghul-inspired domes and minarets of the mosque were bathed in elegant floodlights, a serene and holy sight against the deepening twilight. The modern "River of Life" promenade was alive with its nightly display, machines pumping out clouds of artificial mist that swirled under coloured lights, a tourist-friendly spectacle designed to mask the river’s murky reality. But for Seri, the cosmetic illusion was a cruel joke. The deep hum was a roar here, a soundless scream of agony that vibrated up from the tiled walkways and through the soles of her feet. She looked at the water where the two rivers met, and it was not the reflective, illuminated surface the tourists saw. To her senses, the water was a thick, sluggish slurry of black mud, churning with a pain so profound it was almost a physical entity. The scent was not of damp earth and city water, but of decay and deep, geological time, a smell of things long buried and violently disturbed.

Ignoring the crowds and their cameras, Seri led the way to a small, deserted stone landing that jutted out over the confluence, a quiet corner overlooked by the grand spectacle. The air here was heavy, weighted with sorrow. Bayang took up a silent watch, positioning himself between her and the rest of the world, a sentinel of shadow and muscle against the bright city lights. Seri sank to the ground, her legs too weak to hold her, and pressed her palms flat against the cool, damp stone of the embankment. The vibration was overwhelming, a torrent of non-human emotion that threatened to sweep her away. Closing her eyes, she took a slow, centering breath and did the only thing she could. She reached out with a filament of her own magic, not to probe, to fight, or to fix, but simply to offer. It was a thin, clean thread of silver light, tasting of quiet rain and cool limestone, a silent message sent into the maelstrom: *I hear you. I am here. Show me your hurt.*

The response was not an attack, but an inundation. Her consciousness was pulled from the stone landing and plunged into the river's memory, a torrent of sensory data that made the experience on the Skybridge feel like a child’s story. She was not an observer; she was the river itself. She felt the crushing weight of millennia, the slow, patient carving of a path through a jungle so dense the sun was a distant myth. She felt the cool, clean water teeming with fish she had no name for, the heavy tread of giant, long-vanished mammals on her banks. Then, in a jarring, painful flash, she felt the first boats, the sting of the first human refuse. She felt the churn of the tin dredges, the mud of her banks turning into a fever of human greed. She felt the weight of the first bridges, the foundations of the first shophouses, the raw sewage of a burgeoning city. The memories were not sequential. They were a chaotic, simultaneous superimposition. She was a pristine jungle river and a polluted urban waterway at the exact same moment. She felt the joy of a kingfisher snatching a fish from her surface and the agony of a car battery leaking acid into her depths, both happening now, forever.

With a ragged gasp, Seri tore her consciousness back, her hands flying from the stone as if it were burning. She was back on the landing, her heart hammering against her ribs, the scent of phantom mud and extinct blossoms still clinging to her senses. Bayang was instantly at her side, nudging her face, a low, worried rumble in his chest. She looked at him, her eyes wide with a new, more terrifying understanding. The problem was infinitely worse than she had imagined. The genius loci wasn't just wounded or awake. Jebat's temporal shockwave had shattered its sense of self, unstitching it from the linear flow of time. It was experiencing its entire existence, from the Pleistocene to the present, all at once. The pain radiating from it was the agony of a being forced to occupy a billion different moments simultaneously. And that temporal dissonance, that fundamental break in reality's fabric, was starting to fray the city itself. This wasn't a wound she could mend or a spell she could unravel. She had to find a way to teach a god of the earth to perceive time correctly again, to convince it to let go of the jungle and accept the concrete. And she had to do it before Kuala Lumpur itself became just another one of its fading, superimposed memories.### Chapter 7

The world slammed back into Seri with the force of a physical blow. She was on her hands and knees on the cold stone, gagging, the phantom taste of primeval mud and industrial sludge coating her tongue. The roar of the city’s traffic was a thin, brittle sound layered over the deep, unending echo of the river’s pain. It was not a wound she could stitch or a spell she could counter. It was a fundamental shattering of consciousness, a being of immense power driven mad by the dislocation of its own self. She felt as if she had looked upon the face of a god as it was being vivisected, and the sight had nearly broken her. Bayang’s head was a solid, insistent pressure against her shoulder, his rough tongue rasping at her cheek, a desperate attempt to pull her back from the precipice of a thousand drowning memories.

“It’s broken,” she choked out, her voice a raw whisper. “Bayang, its memory… it’s all happening at once. The jungle, the tin mines, this… all of it. Now.” She looked up, her eyes wide with a terror that went far beyond Jebat’s petty cruelty. This was an existential crisis on a geological scale. As if to punctuate her words, the world stuttered. For a single, heart-stopping second, the colourful mists of the River of Life project vanished, and the modern, tiled promenade was replaced by a tangled lattice of mangrove roots clinging to a steep, muddy bank. The air was suddenly thick with the buzz of insects she had no name for and the screech of a monkey. A Japanese tourist, frozen mid-selfie, flickered, his digital camera momentarily becoming a pith helmet and a waxed moustache. Then, just as quickly, the vision snapped back, the promenade returning with a sickening lurch, leaving the tourist blinking in confusion, absently rubbing his upper lip.

The glitches were accelerating. The poison was spreading. The city’s timeline was becoming porous, leaking memories from a past that was no longer past. Seri knew with a chilling certainty that soon these flickers would last longer. A bullock cart would materialize in the middle of Jalan Tun Perak for a full minute, causing a multi-car pile-up. A British colonial officer would walk out of a wall in the old post office, utterly bewildered. The very fabric of Kuala Lumpur’s reality, held together by the collective belief and linear perception of its inhabitants, was beginning to unravel because its spiritual foundation was lost in a temporal hurricane. She couldn’t fight it. How could she fight a memory? How could she heal a being whose very perception of ‘now’ had been annihilated?

Her gaze, filled with a dawning despair, lifted from the churning, wounded water and fell upon the grand structure on the opposite bank. The Sultan Abdul Samad Building stood magnificent against the bruised twilight, its copper domes and soaring clock tower a monument to a different kind of power. It was a declaration of order, of empire, of human time imposed upon the wild land. And the clock tower… a 41-meter-tall testament to the second, the minute, the hour. It was a metronome of iron and brass, a relentless, mechanical heartbeat that had measured the city’s life for over a century. It was an anchor. A story. It was the only thing that made sense.

The plan that bloomed in her mind was born not of cleverness but of pure, terrified desperation. She could not force the genius loci back into the present. But she could offer it a thread, a narrative lifeline to pull itself out of the chaotic sea of its own history. She had to tell it the story of itself, from the perspective of the city that grew upon its banks. She had to provide a clear, undeniable, and continuous signal of the present moment, a signal so powerful it would cut through the noise of the past. The clock tower would be her focus, the symbol of linear time. And she, drawing upon the raw, chaotic, living energy of the city’s millions of souls—the pulse of the *now*—would be the amplifier. It was an act of staggering arrogance and recklessness. To willingly make herself a conduit for the psychic energy of an entire metropolis could incinerate her mind, scattering her own consciousness across time just like the river’s.

She pushed herself to her feet, her body swaying with exhaustion and dread. She looked at Bayang, her silent partner, her other self. “I have to ground it,” she said, her voice steadier now, hardened by resolve. “I’m going to use the clock tower as a focus. I will… offer it the city. The city as it is right now. A single, clear moment to hold onto.” She reached out, her hand sinking into the thick fur of his neck. “But I will be… open. Vulnerable. I need you to guard me. Not just my body. If I get lost in there, Bayang… if I start to drift… you are my anchor. Your heart beats in the now. Do not let me forget the sound of it.”

His answering rumble was a deep, resonant vow. He understood the danger not in its magical complexities, but in its primal truth. She was venturing into a storm, and he was the rope tied to the shore. Without another word, they moved, leaving the chaotic spectacle of the river behind them. They crossed the bridge, a strange island of normalcy in the spreading temporal sickness. They walked into the vast, open expanse of Merdeka Square, the great green field where a nation’s identity had been born. The air here was even stranger, thick with unseen presences. The scent of car exhaust mingled with the smell of wood smoke from a village that hadn’t existed for 150 years. The faint sounds of a nearby rock concert were interwoven with the phantom jingle of colonial horse bridles. The great flagpole, the tallest in the world, seemed to flicker at the edge of vision, sometimes a flagpole, sometimes a colossal, ancient tree.

Seri stopped in the very center of the field, planting her bare feet firmly on the cool, damp grass. Across the road, the Sultan Abdul Samad Building stood like a fairytale palace, its clock tower a stern finger pointing at the star-dusted sky. She was exposed here, a tiny, fragile figure in a vast, haunted space. She took a deep, shuddering breath, the air tasting of history and ozone. Bayang moved to stand directly behind her, his body a solid wall of muscle and loyalty pressed against her back. He did not lie down but remained standing, a vigilant, four-legged fortress. As if on cue, a deep, resonant bell began to toll from the clock tower, the sound rolling across the square, counting out the ninth hour of the evening. Each chime was a hammer blow of ordered reality, a defiant declaration of the present moment. Dong. The city held its breath. Dong. The hum of the wounded spirit seemed to quiet, to listen. Dong. The game had begun. When the last echo faded into the night, Seri closed her eyes, spread her arms wide to the city, and let go.Letting go was not a gentle release. It was the shattering of a dam. The psychic noise of Kuala Lumpur, a force Seri had spent her entire life filtering and deflecting, rushed into her with the force of a tsunami. It was a billion mundane thoughts, a million simmering anxieties, a hundred thousand tiny, fleeting joys. The collective impatience of the evening traffic jam on the LDP. The sudden, sharp craving for a Ramly burger from a thousand different stomachs. The bone-deep weariness of construction workers heading home, the flutter of first-date nerves in a cafe in Bangsar, the quiet grief of a woman lighting a candle in a temple, the frantic calculations of a stock trader watching the Nikkei index. It was a cacophony of life in all its glorious, chaotic, and overwhelmingly trivial detail. The sheer volume of it threatened to annihilate her own consciousness, to dissolve her sense of self into the vast, churning ocean of the city’s collective soul. Her own memories, her own name, her own pain, became a single drop of water in a tidal wave.

She was drowning. Her mind latched onto the strongest signals, losing its own shape. For a terrifying instant, she *was* a foodpanda rider named Rizal, his anxiety a hot knot in her stomach as he worried about a late delivery and the rating that would follow. His leg ached from an old football injury, and the taste of cheap coffee was bitter on her/his tongue. She was losing her grip, her own identity fraying and dissolving into the raw data of another’s life. Just as the name ‘Seri’ began to feel like a word from a foreign language, a new sensation cut through the noise, a signal not of the mind, but of the body. A steady, slow, powerful beat. *Thump-thump. Thump-thump.* It was the rhythm of a heart that was not hers, a deep and ancient percussion that beat in the absolute now. It was Bayang. The solid, warm weight of his body against her back, the faint, clean scent of his fur, and the profound, unwavering beat of his heart became her only reality. He was her anchor in the storm of a million other lives, his presence the one undeniable truth in a sea of fleeting perceptions.

Clinging to the anchor of Bayang’s heartbeat, Seri stopped fighting the psychic torrent and began to navigate it. She was no longer trying to block it, but to listen, to find the harmony within the noise. She let the individual lives wash over her, and instead sought the threads that bound them all together in this single, shared moment. She found the collective, city-wide sigh of relief as offices emptied out. She felt the shared, primal anticipation of the evening meal. She sensed the unified glow of millions of screens—phones, televisions, laptops—a vast, electronic web of simultaneous experience. These were the currents in the ocean, the shared rhythms of the metropolis. With an immense effort of will, she began to gather these threads, not with her hands, but with her intent, weaving them together, compacting the sprawling, chaotic energy of the city into a single, focused stream. The raw psychic noise was being refined, distilled into the pure, undeniable essence of *Kuala Lumpur, 9:07 PM, on this Tuesday*.

The focused energy had nowhere to go but out. A river of pure, silver-white light, shimmering with the energy of three million souls, flowed from her outstretched hands. It did not blast forth, but streamed across the haunted grass of Merdeka Square, a silent, luminous river of pure *now*. It struck the base of the clock tower, which absorbed the energy with a low, resonant hum that was felt more than heard. The century-old brick and plaster, the iron gears and brass bells, became a colossal tuning fork, a spiritual antenna vibrating with the unified frequency of the present moment. And from its highest point, the tower began to broadcast. It was not a sound or a light, but a feeling, a relentless, steady pulse of ordered, linear time. It was a story told in a single, unwavering note, a declaration that the past was past, and the future was not yet, that there was only this single, continuous, unfolding moment.

The wounded earth-spirit reacted with a spasm of agony and confusion. The ground beneath Seri’s feet shuddered violently, and the temporal glitches flared with a terrifying intensity. Across the square, the phantom figures became horrifyingly solid. A group of British officers in starched white uniforms and pith helmets stared in disbelief at the glowing clock tower, their ghostly forms flickering between solidity and smoke. The spectral echo of a long-demolished market appeared over the pristine lawn, the ghostly chatter of its vendors a maddening counterpoint to the distant traffic. From the direction of the river, a great, sorrowful roar of a thousand superimposed pasts rose up to meet the clear, steady note of the present. It was a battle of wills on a scale Seri could barely comprehend: the chaotic, agonized memory of the land itself versus the focused, ephemeral consciousness of the city that now sat upon it.

Seri was the fulcrum, the fragile bridge upon which this impossible war was being waged. The strain was immense, a physical and spiritual agony that made her earlier exhaustion feel like a pleasant memory. The silver light pouring from her hands was no longer just the city's energy; it was her own life force, her own soul, being used as the fuel to sustain the connection. The white streak in her hair began to glow with a soft, internal luminescence, a visible sign of the immense power she was channeling. Her body trembled, her teeth were clenched, and a thin line of blood trickled from her nose, but her feet remained planted on the grass, her connection to Bayang absolute. She was locked in a perfect, terrifying stalemate, her will the only thing holding the present moment together, keeping the city from being drowned in the river of its own shattered history. The clock tower continued its silent broadcast, and the wounded land continued to scream, and in the middle of it all, Seri Bintang burned.### Chapter 8

The stalemate was a fire, and Seri was its fuel. She was a burning pyre of her own making in the center of Merdeka Square, and the city was feeding her the flames. The torrent of human consciousness she channeled was no longer a wave but a solid wall of force, and she was the fragile mortar holding it together. The pain was absolute, a white-hot agony that transcended the physical. She felt the filaments of her own soul beginning to unravel, to fray under the immense strain of being the focal point for a war between geological time and human history. The ghostly figures of the past flickered and swirled around her, their spectral forms growing more agitated, their silent screams adding to the universal chorus of pain. Her own identity was a flickering candle in a hurricane, threatening to be extinguished at any moment, its light swallowed by the universe of screaming ghosts she had invited into her mind. The only thing that kept her from shattering into a million pieces was the relentless, steady beat of the heart against her back. *Thump-thump. Thump-thump.* Bayang. The mountain of absolute present.

It was not working. The raw, brute force of the city’s ‘now’ was an assault, and the wounded spirit was fighting back with the terror of a cornered animal. She was trying to shout it into submission, but it was deafened by its own agony. The realization struck her with the force of a physical blow, a moment of dreadful clarity in the heart of the inferno. She was a healer, not a warrior. She was trying to fix a broken bone by hitting it with a hammer. The clock tower’s relentless broadcast was a declaration of war, not a song of peace. She had to change the message. She could not force the river to accept the present; she had to show it that it was already a part of it. She had to weave it into the story, not write it out.

With a gasp that tore at her lungs, Seri shifted her focus. It was the most difficult thing she had ever done, like trying to turn a battleship with a canoe paddle. She stopped gathering the abstract, chaotic energy of the city’s thoughts and anxieties. Instead, she began to seek a specific thread within the psychic tsunami. She sought the city’s relationship with water. She found a young woman in a high-rise condominium in Mont Kiara, taking a shower, the clean, warm water a simple, unthinking comfort. She found an old man in a Kampung Baru warung, carefully brewing a pot of tea. She found street cleaners hosing down the pavements of Bukit Bintang, washing away the grime of the day. She found the collected rainwater in a drain, reflecting the neon lights. She found the latent humidity in the very air, a memory of the storm, clinging to everything. All of it, in its origin, was the river. The city drank the river, bathed in it, cleaned with it, breathed it. It was not an enemy to be paved over; it was the city's lifeblood, its circulatory system, hidden but essential.

She gathered these gentler, more intimate moments. She took the feeling of clean water on skin, the taste of hot tea on a tongue, the sight of a puddle reflecting the moon. She wove them into the torrent of energy she was channeling, changing its texture, its very nature. The brutal, declarative signal of ‘now’ was softened, infused with a new message, a different story. It was no longer a shout, but a whisper. *You are not forgotten. You are not gone. You have only changed your shape. You are in our pipes, in our cups, in the very air we breathe. You are still here. You are still us.* She sent this new story streaming across the grass, a river of light that was no longer just silver, but now shot through with the soft blues and greens of clean, life-giving water.

When this new energy struck the clock tower, the nature of the broadcast changed. The relentless, mechanical pulse softened into a resonant, complex chord, a sound that spoke not just of time, but of flow and continuation. The great, sorrowful roar from the wounded earth did not cease, but its tone began to shift. The agony lessened, replaced by a profound and ancient confusion, and then, a dawning curiosity. The cacophony of ages began to quiet as the spirit listened, not to a threat, but to a lullaby, a story of its own endurance in a form it had not recognized. The spectral chaos in the square began to subside. The British officers did not vanish in a flash, but faded gently, like mist burning off in the morning sun, their bewildered expressions softening into something like peace. The phantom market dissolved, its ghostly chatter fading into a respectful silence. The temporal bleeding slowed, then stopped.

Finally, Seri felt a great, geological sigh of acceptance ripple through the earth. The deep, agonizing hum that had been the bass note of her world for hours transformed, settling into a slow, deep, and steady rhythm, the peaceful, sleeping breath of a being that had at last found its place in the present. The connection snapped. The river of light vanished. The broadcast from the clock tower ceased. The psychic noise of the city retreated, leaving behind a silence so absolute that Seri’s ears rang. The world, for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, was solid again. The strength that had held her upright, that had made her a conduit for a god, vanished in an instant. Her legs crumpled, her consciousness spiraled into a pinprick of light, and she fell into a darkness as deep and quiet as the river’s newfound dream.The darkness that took Seri was not a void, but a velvet cushion. There was no pain, no fear, only a profound and absolute cessation of self. She fell not through space, but through silence, a bottomless well of peace that was the polar opposite of the psychic inferno she had just endured. The last sensation to fade was the steady, rhythmic beat of the heart against her back, a deep and faithful drum that followed her into the quiet dark, a promise of return. She was a single, extinguished spark falling into a deep, calm ocean, the war over, her duty done, her very consciousness dissolving into a well-earned nothingness.

Bayang felt the change in the instant it happened. The blazing furnace of power that had been his companion vanished, replaced by the simple, fragile weight of a girl. Her body, which had been a rigid conduit of impossible energy, went limp against him, a puppet with its strings cut. He did not panic. Panic was a luxury of the uncertain. His purpose, now that the ethereal battle was won, was singular and absolute: protect the body, shelter the soul. He shifted his weight with impossible speed and grace, catching her before she could hit the ground, his massive head and shoulder dipping to cradle her falling form. She was unnervingly light, a bundle of tired bones and soaked clothing. With a gentleness that belied his immense power, he nudged her until he could get his head beneath her shoulders and legs, and then, with a surge of coiled muscle, he lifted her. Her head lolled against his neck, the glowing white streak in her hair now just a pale, lifeless mark against his dark fur.

The journey back to Pudu was a silent, nocturnal pilgrimage. Bayang became a creature of pure shadow, a phantom carrying a phantom. He did not take the main roads, which were still humming with the city's late-night traffic, but flowed through the forgotten arteries of Kuala Lumpur. He moved through the manicured gardens of Merdeka Square, a ripple in the darkness that the bored security guards never saw. He trotted down the center of deserted back alleys where the only light came from the flickering signs of shuttered shops. He used the immense, concrete pillars of the elevated highways as cover, his form indistinguishable from the deep pools of shadow they cast. The city was oblivious, its millions of inhabitants wrapped in their own small lives, never knowing that their reality had been saved by the unconscious girl being carried through their midst by a beast from another world. He moved not with frantic haste, but with a steady, relentless pace, his cargo held precious and secure, his golden eyes scanning every shadow for threats that were, for once, entirely mundane.

While her body was carried through the sleeping city, Seri’s mind drifted in a gentle, liminal space. She was not dreaming, but experiencing the quiet echoes of the world she had just saved. She felt the gentle, rhythmic flow of water, not the agonized torrent of the river’s memory, but the clean, steady pulse in the city’s pipes, the soft patter of condensation dripping from an air-conditioning unit, the slow exhalation of moisture from the leaves in the Lake Gardens. The million voices of the city were gone, but a single, collective hum remained, the quiet, contented murmur of a metropolis at rest. These sensations were not invasive; they were a soft blanket, a soothing balm on her scoured soul. She floated in this peaceful harbor of consciousness, her own identity slowly, carefully knitting itself back together, each thread finding its proper place, guided by the distant, steady beat of a faithful heart.

He reached their rooftop just as the first hint of grey began to soften the eastern sky. The final ascent up the rusted fire escape was the most difficult part of the journey, requiring a slow, careful, and awkward climb with his precious burden. He finally hauled them both over the cornice onto the familiar tiles of their sanctuary. He did not place her on the hard roof, but moved to their most sheltered corner, where a collection of old cushions and a threadbare blanket served as their sparse furnishings. He laid her down with painstaking care, arranging the blanket over her as best he could with his nose and paws. Then, his duty as her transport complete, he resumed his primary role. He curled his massive body around her slight form, a living wall of muscle and fur, shielding her from the slight morning chill. He rested his head on his paws, but he did not sleep. His golden eyes, reflecting the first pale light of dawn, remained open, fixed on her face, watching, waiting, guarding the healer as she healed herself.

Consciousness returned not as a rush, but as a slow, gentle tide. The first thing Seri became aware of was the rough texture of the blanket against her cheek, then the profound, all-encompassing ache in every muscle of her body. She felt as if she had been physically disassembled and put back together incorrectly. A desperate, burning thirst clawed at her throat. She opened her eyes, and the world was a soft-focus blur of grey and rose. She was home. The familiar skyline of her city was spread out before her, solid, real, and blessedly quiet. The psychic silence in her mind was no longer a terrifying vacuum but a clean, spacious peace. Beneath that silence, she could feel it: a deep, slow, and steady rhythm, like the breathing of a mountain. The river spirit was asleep, its dreams now calm and untroubled. She had not silenced it; she had sung it a lullaby of its own continuing existence, and it had listened.

A low rumble vibrated through the cushions. She turned her head, the simple movement a monumental effort, and met the golden, unwavering gaze of her companion. Bayang. He had not moved from his vigil. He blinked slowly, a silent question. *Are you back?* She didn't have the strength to speak, but she managed to lift a trembling hand and lay it on his massive head. The contact was an anchor, a confirmation. In his eyes, she saw the reflection of her own face, pale and drawn, but hers. And in that reflection, she saw the white streak in her hair. It was no longer a dead, chalky mark. It shone now with a soft, pearlescent lustre, like moonlight trapped in silk, imbued with a quiet, clean power. It was not a scar anymore. It was a part of her power, a testament to a price paid and a balance restored. She looked from her reflection in his eyes to the city, which was now catching the first direct rays of the sun. The twin spires of the Petronas Towers were tipped in brilliant gold. The night was over. They had survived. And in the clean, quiet morning, for the first time in a very long time, everything was still.The first and most urgent reality was thirst. It was a raw, rasping desperation that superseded all aches and pains, a fire in her throat that demanded to be quenched. When Seri tried to push herself into a sitting position, a violent wave of vertigo and a full-body tremor sent her collapsing back onto the cushions. Every joint screamed, every muscle fiber felt as if it had been individually frayed and then braided back together too tightly. Bayang was there in an instant, his great head nudging her shoulder with a gentleness that was a testament to his control. He made a low, questioning sound deep in his chest, a sound that was pure, uncomplicated concern. Seri managed to croak a single word, her voice a dry husk. "Water." The command was understood not by the word, but by the desperate need behind it. Bayang gave her hand a brief lick with his rough tongue before vanishing over the edge of the roof, his mission clear and immediate.

Left alone for those few moments, Seri took a ragged inventory of her internal landscape. The roaring silence was still there, but it was no longer a void. It was a vast, clean chamber, and within it, she could feel two distinct rhythms. The first was her own weary heartbeat, slow and fluttery like a wounded bird. The second was a new, permanent addition to her senses: the deep, sonorous, and profoundly peaceful pulse of the sleeping river spirit. It was a bass note that resonated at the very edge of her perception, a constant, gentle pressure that was not an intrusion but a presence, like feeling the warmth of a great, sleeping animal in the next room. She realized with a start that the chaotic psychic noise of the city she had filtered her whole life was gone, not because she was blocking it, but because her connection to the genius loci now acted as a natural filter, a grounding rod that drew the city’s frantic, surface-level static into the deep, quiet earth, leaving only the clearer, more significant signals for her to perceive.

Her trembling hand rose to touch the streak of white hair. It felt cool against her skin, and as her fingers brushed against it, a faint, clean energy flowed into her, not enough to heal her profound exhaustion, but enough to quell the worst of the tremors. It was a direct line, a tiny tributary flowing from the great, sleeping river of power she had just calmed. The pearlescent lustre she had seen was real, and it pulsed with a soft, internal light in response to her touch, a light that only she could see. It was a key, a tool, a souvenir from a conversation with a god, gifted to her in exchange for her pain. The scar had become a new sense organ, a compass needle that pointed not north, but towards the deep magic of the land itself. She was no longer just a janitor cleaning up magical messes; she was now, inextricably, a part of the city’s ancient foundation, a steward bound by a bond of shared trauma and healing.

Bayang returned as silently as he had departed, a plastic bottle of mineral water held carefully in his mouth. Where he had procured it, Seri did not ask; his methods of navigating the mundane world were his own mysterious art. He dropped it gently beside her, then watched with intense focus as she struggled to sit up, her movements slow and painful. She finally managed to unscrew the cap with fumbling fingers and drank, the cool, clean water a benediction on her parched throat. It was the most exquisitely real sensation she had ever experienced, a grounding force that pulled her scattered senses back into the singular reality of her own body. She drank half the bottle in long, desperate gulps before leaning back, her head resting against the warm brick, the simple act of hydration leaving her breathless. Bayang let out a soft huff of air, a sound of profound relief, and settled beside her, his body a solid bulwark against the world.

The slow, arduous process of recovery filled the rest of the morning. Bayang made two more trips, returning with a warm, flaky curry puff and a plastic bag of pau, still steaming. Seri ate with a slow, deliberate focus, each bite an act of conscious self-repair. As strength slowly, grudgingly returned to her limbs, she found the clarity to examine the events of the night not as a traumatic assault, but as a sequence of choices. She could have let Jebat’s prank run its course, a cruel but contained event. She could have fought the river spirit, tried to force it into submission, and likely been destroyed in the process. Instead, at every turn, she had chosen to absorb, to shield, to connect, to heal. The cost had been immense, etched permanently into her hair and her soul, but the result was a balance she had never known, a quiet harmony between the city of steel and the earth of memory. She was tired, so deeply tired, but for the first time, she felt a sense of purpose that went beyond mere reaction. She was not just a guardian against chaos; she was a bridge.

As the sun reached its zenith, casting sharp, unforgiving shadows across the rooftop, Seri finally found the strength to stand on her own. She walked to the edge of the cornice, Bayang a pace behind her, and looked out over the sprawling, hazy panorama of her city. It looked the same. The traffic was a roaring river of metal, the air was a familiar cocktail of heat and fumes, the distant towers scraped at the hazy sky. It was the same city, but she was seeing it with new eyes, hearing it with new ears. The surface-level noise was still there, but it was muted, less important. Beneath it, she could feel the deep, steady pulse of the sleeping land, the quiet, clean flow of its waters through the city’s hidden veins, and the soft, pearlescent hum of the power now woven into her own being. A fragile peace had been forged, a new equilibrium established. She knew it would not last forever. The world was full of other wounds, other imbalances, other fools like Jebat. But for now, in the quiet heart of the roaring city, she was still. And she was ready for whatever came next.### Chapter 9

Days bled into a week, a quiet period of healing and recalibration. The profound, bone-deep exhaustion receded like a slow tide, leaving behind a shoreline of persistent aches that Seri learned to live with. She slept for long, dreamless stretches, her mind and body knitting themselves back together in the quiet sanctuary of their rooftop perch, guarded by Bayang’s silent, ceaseless vigil. When she was awake, she spent hours in silent meditation, not to shield herself from the city’s psychic noise, but to explore the vast, clean quiet that had taken its place. The frantic, surface-level static of three million lives was gone, filtered away through her new, intrinsic connection to the land. What remained was a deeper, more profound sensory landscape. She could feel the slow, steady pulse of the sleeping river spirit, a continental rhythm that was now the bass note of her own existence. Layered over it were the clearer, more significant currents of the city’s magic: the ancient, limestone stillness of the Batu Caves to the north, the faint, sorrowful echoes of old battlefields long since paved over, and the vibrant, chaotic hum of devotion that emanated from the temples and mosques. It was as if she had been listening to a thousand out-of-tune radios her whole life and someone had finally, mercifully, switched them all off, allowing her to hear the true music of the spheres.

One afternoon, as the sun began its descent, casting long, golden fingers of light between the city's towers, Seri decided it was time. She stood, her movements no longer pained, but deliberate and fluid. She looked at Bayang, who had been watching her with an unnerving, patient intensity. No words were needed. It was time to walk the new world. They descended into the city, but instead of the usual tension of a mission, Seri felt a strange sense of calm curiosity. For the first time, she was not hunting a disturbance or cleaning up a mess. She was simply exploring her own home. She focused her intent on the white streak in her hair, no longer an alien object but an extension of her own senses. As she did, the pearlescent strand hummed with a soft, internal energy, and her perception of the world shifted. The city’s magical geography laid itself out before her like an invisible map. Faint lines of power, like shimmering threads of heat, followed the buried paths of old rivers and ancient jungle trails. Bright, pulsing nodes of energy marked places of worship, while dark, silent pools denoted areas of deep sorrow or forgotten violence. It was a cartography of the soul, and she was, for the first time, literate in its language.

Her new compass pulled her north, not with the urgency of a summons, but with the gentle, magnetic pull of a significant landmark. They took the Komuter train, the rhythmic clatter of the tracks a soothing counterpoint to the deep, slow pulse of the earth. As they traveled, she let her senses drift, brushing against the faint energy signatures of the people around her. It was different now. She no longer felt the invasive rush of their anxieties and desires, but rather a more holistic sense of their place within the city’s web. She could feel the collective pull of a neighborhood, the shared history of a family line, the resonance of a community. She was no longer just seeing the individual trees; she was beginning to perceive the shape of the entire forest. She felt a profound sense of connection that was the antithesis of the psychic drowning she had experienced before, a quiet understanding that she was a part of this vast, intricate tapestry, not just its unseen janitor.

They disembarked at the Batu Caves station, and the moment she stepped onto the platform, the sheer power of the place washed over her. It was not a noise but a presence, a silence so ancient and immense it felt like a physical weight. The great limestone massif, hundreds of millions of years old, was a colossal battery of deep, terrestrial magic, a power that was neither good nor evil, but simply *was*. It was the place she had found Bayang, a bewildered cub torn from his own reality, cowering in the shadow of a power he did not understand. Now, returning to this place of their origin, she felt a sense of coming home, of a circle being completed. Bayang seemed to feel it too. His usual predatory tension eased, replaced by a deep, quiet reverence. He walked at her side, no longer a shadow but a companion, his gaze fixed on the great, looming caves with a look of ancient familiarity. He was a creature of mountains and deep forests, and this place, for all its surrounding urban sprawl, was the closest thing to his lost home that this world had to offer.

As they approached the foot of the great flight of stairs leading up to the temple cave, Seri felt a small, discordant note in the overwhelming symphony of stillness. It was a tiny pocket of agitated energy near a souvenir stall, a frantic, buzzing irritation like a trapped wasp. A younger Seri would have approached with caution, ready for a fight. The new Seri simply walked towards it, her footsteps unhurried. The source was a small, intricately carved wooden mask hanging amongst the cheap plastic keychains and mass-produced statuettes. It was an authentic piece, old and infused with the minor, mischievous spirit of a jungle tree, and it was miserable. Torn from its home, surrounded by the dead plastic and the chaotic energy of the tourists, it was lashing out in a panicked, impotent tantrum, causing the lights in the stall to flicker and giving the tourists who passed too close a sudden, sharp headache. Seri reached out and, without touching the mask itself, laid her hand on the wooden stall beside it. She closed her eyes, and through the conduit of her white streak, she sent a tiny, clean thread of the river spirit’s grounding energy into the wood. She did not command or banish the frantic spirit. She simply offered it a taste of deep earth, a memory of cool soil and quiet rain, a whisper of peace. The frantic buzzing ceased instantly. A profound sense of relief washed out from the mask, a silent wave of gratitude, before the spirit within settled into a deep, quiet dormancy, content to dream of its lost forest. The stall owner, who had been complaining about his faulty wiring all day, suddenly saw his lights steady and shook his head in bafflement. Seri turned away, the act so effortless it was like breathing, and continued her walk. Bayang looked from the now-peaceful mask back to her, and a low, rumbling purr, a sound of deep and profound approval, vibrated in his chest. This was her new power: not the force of a storm, but the quiet, irresistible persuasion of the river finding its way to the sea.They began the long climb. The 272 steps, painted in a riot of vibrant, psychedelic colours, were a river of humanity flowing upwards towards the sacred dark. Tourists in shorts and sandals paused every few dozen steps, panting in the humid heat, their faces slick with sweat. Seri moved through them with a steady, unhurried grace, her breath even, her body no longer fighting itself. Bayang was a silent void at her side, and it was here, on the sacred steps, that his nature became most apparent to the world's wilder inhabitants. The long-tailed macaques, the bold, chattering gangsters of the staircase, fell silent as they approached. A large male, who had been aggressively posturing over a stolen bag of crisps, suddenly froze, his bravado evaporating. He looked at Bayang, and what he saw was not a large black cat, but a hole in the world, a predator of a higher and more absolute order. With a low, submissive chirp, he dropped the bag and melted back into the shadows of the rockface, his entire troop following his lead, a wave of sudden, unnatural quiet that followed the strange pair up the stairs. The tourists noticed only that the monkeys had, for a moment, thankfully vanished.

With each step upward, Seri felt the layers of the place more distinctly. The overwhelming stillness of the limestone was the foundation, a presence of deep, geological time. But laid over it, like a million layers of transparent silk, was the psychic residue of human faith. It was a palpable energy, a shimmering patina polished onto the very air by a century of prayers, chants, and the sheer, focused hope of millions of pilgrims. It was strongest on the handrails, worn smooth by countless hands that had reached for support, both physical and spiritual. She could feel the echo of Thaipusam, the thunderous beat of the kavadi drums, the ecstatic, painful devotion of the penitents, a psychic stain of pure faith that pulsed with a fierce, unified power. Unlike the chaotic, individualistic noise of the city, this energy was coherent, a single, mighty river of belief flowing towards the sacred space above. It did not overwhelm her; it humbled her, making her feel like a single drop of water in a vast and ancient ocean.

They reached the top and passed under the towering golden statue of Lord Murugan, stepping from the bright, oppressive heat of the day into the cool, cavernous immensity of the Temple Cave. The shift was absolute. The air grew still and heavy, smelling of damp earth, bat guano, and the sweet, cloying smoke of incense. The sounds of the outside world vanished, replaced by the echo of dripping water, the coo of rock doves high in the vaulted ceiling, and the distant, rhythmic chanting of a priest. Far above, a great hole in the cavern roof allowed a single, dramatic shaft of sunlight to pierce the gloom, illuminating a swirling cloud of dust motes like a congregation of tiny, glittering spirits. This was not a building; it was the hollow heart of a mountain, a natural cathedral that had been recognized, not created, by the faithful. Bayang’s entire posture softened, his muscles uncoiling as he breathed in the cool, ancient air. He was a creature of deep places, and here, in the belly of the earth, he was profoundly at home.

While tourists flocked to the brightly lit shrines, Seri found a quiet, shadowed alcove away from the main path. The limestone wall was cool and slick with moisture. She pressed her palm flat against it, closing her eyes, and listened not with her ears, but with the new, quiet sense she now possessed. The mountain’s energy was utterly different from the river’s. Where the river had been a being of fluid, emotional, temporal memory, the mountain was a being of immense, patient stillness. It did not have memories in the human sense, but a 'record' of unimaginable pressure, of heat, and of a slowness that made millennia seem like fleeting moments. She felt the slow, patient process of its own creation, the drip of water that formed a stalactite over centuries, the subtle, immense stress of the tectonic plates far below. It was a consciousness that measured time in epochs, a perspective so vast and unhurried that the frantic concerns of the human world were less than the brief flicker of a firefly. It was a deep, grounding peace, a silence not of absence, but of profound and absolute presence.

In that immense, geological quiet, Seri finally understood the full nature of the change within her. Her role was not simply to fight the discordant notes, but to act as a harmonizer. She was not a dam against the flood, but a confluence point, a place where the different magical energies of the land could meet and learn to flow together. The wild, temporal magic of the river; the deep, patient magic of the stone; the fierce, unified magic of human faith; and the small, vital magics of the trees and beasts—they were all part of the same great symphony. Her ordeal had not just given her a new tool; it had retuned her own spirit. The white streak, she now realized, was not a scar or a weapon. It was the physical manifestation of a new balance within her, a perfect fusion of her own innate power with the deep, grounding magic of the land she walked upon. She was no longer just a resident of Kuala Lumpur; she was its living nervous system, a bridge between its concrete skin and its ancient, rocky bones.

Bayang padded over to her quiet corner and came to rest at her feet, curling into a tight circle on the cool stone floor, an unprecedented act of relaxation in a public place. He laid his head on his paws and closed his eyes, a creature of shadow and stone perfectly at home in the heart of the mountain. He was not on guard here. He was at rest. Seri slid down the wall to sit on the floor beside him, her hand coming to rest on his powerful flank. The rhythmic rise and fall of his breathing was a quiet counterpoint to the deep, slow pulse of the mountain around them. The immediate crises were over, the battles won. But looking out from the mouth of the cave at the sprawling, hazy city below, she knew that other dissonances would arise. The balance was a dynamic, living thing, and her work would never truly be done. But for the first time, she did not feel the weight of that duty as a burden. She felt it as a purpose. Here, in the quiet heart of the ancient stone, surrounded by the murmur of faith and the steady presence of her companion, Seri Bintang was finally, completely, at peace.### Chapter 10

The descent from the mountain’s heart was a journey into a different world, though the path was the same. The sunlight, no longer an oppressive force, was simply warm on Seri’s skin. The riot of colour on the 272 steps, which had once seemed a chaotic assault on the senses, now appeared as a vibrant, joyful celebration, a man-made rainbow leading from the earth to the sacred dark. Even the bold macaques, who had resumed their raucous fiefdom over the staircase, gave them a wide and respectful berth. They chattered and postured at the other tourists, but as Seri and Bayang passed, a hush fell, a primal recognition of a new and formidable authority in the land’s hierarchy. Seri felt the quiet hum of their instinctual respect, just as she felt the fading echoes of devotion from the pilgrims descending with her, their hopes and prayers leaving a shimmering, invisible trail in the humid air. She was no longer just walking amongst them; she was a part of the same current, flowing with them back into the sprawling basin of the city.

The train ride home was a revelation. Before, the Komuter car had been a capsule of psychic noise, a cacophony of individual anxieties, desires, and mundane thoughts that she had to actively and exhaustingly block out. Now, as she sat by the window, she did not erect a shield. She simply listened differently. The individual voices were still there, but they were faint, like conversations in a distant room. What came through with pristine clarity were the larger patterns, the shared currents of the city’s soul. She could feel the collective sigh of a neighborhood as the train approached its station, the shared thread of weariness and anticipation of home that connected a hundred strangers. She sensed the invisible bonds of community, the intersecting orbits of families and colleagues, all weaving a vast, intricate, and living tapestry. It was not overwhelming; it was beautiful, and for the first time, she felt a quiet sense of belonging within it, a single, vital thread in a pattern she could finally perceive. Bayang sat on the floor at her feet, a gravity well of pure reality, his presence a constant, comforting pressure against her ankles.

They arrived back in Pudu as the afternoon began to soften towards evening. The familiar assault of smells—frying woks, diesel exhaust, durian—was no longer an assault but a rich, complex perfume, the unmistakable scent of home. The raucous energy of the streets, once a source of constant friction, now felt like the vibrant, messy pulse of a place truly alive. But as they turned onto their own street, her new, clarified senses picked up a small, persistent dissonance. It was a low-grade, grating friction, like the sound of sand in a finely tuned machine. It was centered on a corner where an old, established Chinese medicine hall, smelling of dried roots and quiet history, stood next to a newly opened, aggressively modern bubble tea franchise. The air around the junction felt sour, and Seri noticed how pedestrians hurried past, their faces tight with an irritation they couldn't name.

The medicine hall exuded a slow, patient, and deeply rooted energy, the accumulated magic of a hundred herbs and a thousand quiet consultations. It was a place of balance and tradition. The bubble tea shop, in stark contrast, was a frantic explosion of sugary, synthetic energy, blaring trendy K-pop, its magic all ephemeral social media hype and fluorescent lighting. The two energies were locked in a constant, low-grade territorial war, clashing and curdling in the space between them, creating a psychic dead zone of anxiety and ill-temper. A younger Seri would have seen it as a problem to be solved with shields and wards, an impurity to be scoured. The new Seri saw it differently. Both were part of the city’s evolving story. The old roots and the new shoots were not enemies; they were just neighbours who hadn’t been properly introduced.

Her solution was not one of power, but of connection. She walked into the cool, dark interior of the medicine hall, the air thick with the scent of ginseng and licorice root. An elderly sinseh looked up from behind a dark, polished wood counter, his eyes sharp and questioning. Seri smiled and, in quiet Cantonese, asked for a simple leong cha, a cooling herbal tea. He prepared it with slow, methodical movements, pouring the dark, bitter liquid into a simple glass. The exchange was brief, respectful, a small act that honoured the quiet power of his domain. She paid, took the glass, and walked out into the noisy, vibrant street.

Instead of leaving, Seri sat on a low concrete planter that was positioned almost exactly on the border between the two clashing establishments. On one side, the slow, earthy energy of the medicine hall. On the other, the frantic, sugary rush of the bubble tea shop. She took a slow sip of the bitter tea, its taste a direct connection to the old magic. And as she sat there, a quiet, unassuming figure in the urban chaos, she simply became the bridge. She did not cast a spell or channel a great power. She held the slow, patient energy of the herbal tea within herself while simultaneously allowing the bright, chaotic energy of the pop music and sugary drinks to wash over her. Within the calm, balanced space of her own spirit, she found the commonality: the shared, simple human desire for a restorative drink, for a moment of pause in the heat of the day. Her own harmonized presence, amplified by the silent, pearlescent hum of the streak in her hair, acted as a subtle tuning fork. The grating friction between the two shops did not vanish, but it softened, the two energies learning to flow around each other like streams of oil and water finding a peaceful coexistence.

She finished her tea and disposed of the glass in a nearby bin. The air on the corner felt lighter, the sour note of anxiety gone. A family that had been hesitating on the pavement laughed and pushed their way into the bubble tea shop. An old man, who had been scowling at the music, seemed to relax and, after a moment, turned and entered the quiet dimness of the medicine hall. The invisible knot had been untangled. No one saw what Seri had done. It was an act of magical maintenance as quiet and essential as pulling a weed from a garden. She turned for home, Bayang falling into step beside her, a silent shadow of approval.

Back on their rooftop, the sun was a great, molten orange ball sinking behind the skyline, setting the clouds ablaze. The city lights began to prick the deepening twilight, a man-made constellation sprawling to the horizon. Seri stood at the edge, not as a weary sentry awaiting the next alarm, but as a quiet custodian looking over her domain. The work, she now understood, was not in the grand, desperate battles, but in the thousand small, unseen acts of harmonization that allowed a city of old ghosts and new dreams to live together. It was the work of a gardener, a weaver, a bridge. Bayang came to her side and rested his heavy head against her hip, a solid, comforting weight in the coming night. The peace was not an absence of trouble, but the presence of purpose. And as the first true stars appeared in the darkening sky, Seri Bintang finally felt like she was home.The weeks that followed settled into a new and unfamiliar rhythm of peace. Seri’s life, once a reactive scramble from one magical crisis to the next, found a quiet cadence dictated by the rising and setting of the sun. The rooftop was no longer just a watchtower but a conservatory, a place where she sat for hours, not in tense vigilance, but in deep, attentive listening. She learned the city’s hums and pulses, the daily ebb and flow of its spiritual tides. She could feel the swell of communal energy during Friday prayers, the quiet, collective melancholy of a rainy Monday morning, the sharp, joyful spike of a major football victory. Her new senses painted a picture of a city not as a collection of chaotic individuals, but as a single, sprawling, complex organism. Bayang was her constant shadow in this new practice, a creature of profound stillness who seemed to take deep comfort in her own newfound calm. He would lie for hours in a patch of sun, his breathing a slow and steady counterpoint to the city’s vast, intricate song, a picture of domestic tranquility that was profoundly at odds with the coiled power of his form.

It was during one of these quiet evenings, with the sky bleeding from orange to indigo, that she first noticed it. It was not a pain, or a dissonance, or a cry for help. It was a skipped beat. For a single, imperceptible instant, the entire symphony of the city would falter, a momentary hiccup in its rhythm so brief she initially dismissed it as a figment of her own recovering senses. But it happened again the next day, and then twice the day after. It was like a tiny, recurring flaw in a beautiful piece of music, a split-second of silence that made the subsequent notes feel subtly wrong. It was not aggressive or malicious, but it was a sign of a fundamental instability, a tremor deep within the city’s metaphysical foundations. The sleeping river spirit did not stir, and the mountain’s deep stillness remained untroubled. This was something else, a different order of problem, and its quiet, persistent irregularity began to prick at Seri’s peace, a question she could no longer ignore.

She decided to trace the anomaly not as a hunt, but as an inquiry. One afternoon, waiting for the flicker, she stood on the rooftop and held her focus, ready. When it came, a fleeting moment of universal silence, she cast out a fine, inquisitive thread of her own energy, using the pearlescent streak in her hair as a divining rod. The thread did not find a knot of hostile magic or a wounded entity, but was instead tugged towards a place of immense, faded power, a place of comings and goings, of hellos and goodbyes. The invisible line pulled her towards the old colonial heart of the city, towards the grand, Moorish spires and domes of the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. She and Bayang descended into the afternoon bustle, moving with a shared, unhurried purpose, a quiet question leading them through the familiar streets. This felt different from the frantic pursuit of Jebat; it was less a chase and more a diagnosis, a doctor following a strange and intermittent symptom to its source.

The station was a palace of ghosts. Its magnificent, arched hallways and wide, tiled platforms, once the throbbing heart of the nation’s transit, were now mostly quiet, superseded by the city’s newer, more efficient hubs. The air within was thick with a unique energy, a dense tapestry of a million departures and a million arrivals. It was a place saturated with the emotions of transit: the sharp tang of hope, the dull ache of farewell, the weary relief of homecoming. The grand hall echoed with the phantom whistles of steam trains and the ghostly announcements of destinations long since removed from the timetables. Here, the temporal flickering Seri had sensed was much stronger, more frequent. It felt as if the very air was snagging on something, causing the dense atmosphere of memory to stutter and skip. The scent of old diesel fumes and ozone mingled with something else, a faint, unidentifiable smell of wilderness and distance, of a place that was not here.

Following the sensation, she bypassed the main hall and the few active platforms, her path leading her to the far, disused end of the station. Here, a short, forgotten platform lay covered in a fine layer of dust, its tracks rusting in the humid air. And in the center of the platform, she found it. It was not a monster or a spell, but a flaw in the world. For a fraction of a second, a patch of air about the size of a doorway shimmered violently and seemed to tear, offering a dizzying, momentary glimpse of… elsewhere. It was not a clear image, but a chaotic riot of alien senses: the sight of a sky with two suns, the scent of crystalline foliage, the sound of a wind that sang in an unearthly key. Then, with a faint pop like a bursting soap bubble, reality snapped back into place. It was a wound, a scar on the fabric of the world, a tiny, flickering echo of the great, violent rift that had torn Bayang from his own existence decades ago.

The realization struck Seri with the force of a physical blow. She had found the source of the city’s skipped beat, and it was the echo of her companion’s own traumatic birth into this world. She turned to look at Bayang, and the sight stole her breath. He was frozen, his body rigid with a tension she had never seen before, not even in battle. His gaze was locked on the spot where the world had just torn open, his nostrils flared, his ears pinned back. He was not looking at a magical anomaly; he was looking at the ghost of the door that had stolen him from his home. A low, soft sound, a sound of profound and heartbreaking loss, escaped his throat. It was the first sound of true sorrow she had ever heard him make. He could smell his own world, his lost home, in those fleeting, agonizing flickers of un-reality.

Stepping forward, her own heart aching with a sudden, fierce empathy, Seri knew what she had to do. Her old instinct would have been to seal the wound, to force it closed, to cauterize the flaw in reality. But the river had taught her a different way. A wound forced shut often festered. A scar, however, could be integrated, strengthened. She approached the spot on the dusty platform, her hand outstretched. When the next flicker began, the tear appearing with its flash of alien senses, she did not flinch. She sent a gentle, steady stream of her new, balanced power into the fraying edges of the rift. It was a power infused with the deep, patient stillness of the mountain and the calm, flowing acceptance of the river. She was not closing a door; she was reinforcing the frame. She was soothing the scarred tissue of reality, persuading it not to tear, but to hold.

Under the gentle, insistent pressure of her will, the violent, frantic tearing stopped. The momentary glimpse into another world vanished. But the anomaly did not disappear entirely. It settled, stabilized, coalescing into a quiet, permanent shimmer in the air, a spot of heat-haze that no longer disrupted the space around it. It was still a scar, but it was a healed one, no longer a source of frantic energy but a quiet, stable part of the station’s strange geography. Seri stepped back, a wave of dizziness passing over her as the effort subsided. She had found her new work. It was not the grand, spectacular defense of the city, but the quiet, constant mending of a thousand tiny wounds that threatened its integrity. It was the work of a cosmic seamstress, patiently stitching the fabric of her world back together. She turned to Bayang, her heart heavy with the new, complicated weight of their shared purpose. He had finally torn his gaze from the now-stable shimmer, and was looking at her, his ancient, golden eyes filled with a universe of sorrow, gratitude, and a new, terrible understanding. The force that had taken his world from him was the same one his companion was now destined to mend.
