The world, for Eleanor Vance, was an exercise in double-entry bookkeeping. For every debit, a credit. For every asset, a liability. Her life in Torquay was a meticulously balanced ledger, each day a neat column of predictable transactions. She rose at six-thirty. Tea (Earl Grey, one sugar, milk first), followed by a single slice of toast with precisely seven grams of unsalted butter. She would then sit at her small, perfectly ordered bureau and balance her personal accounts from the previous day, a ritual as ingrained and necessary as breathing. The numbers were compliant, logical. They did what they were told. They did not possess the messy, unpredictable urges of the sea that crashed and sighed just a half-mile from her front door. The sea, with its chaotic tides and fathomless depths, cared not for balance sheets. Eleanor found it vaguely unsettling.

Her firm, Abernathy & Codd, Chartered Accountants, occupied the third floor of a mock-Georgian building overlooking the harbour. From her window, she could see the masts of the yachts clinking a frantic, disorderly rhythm against each other. For ten years, this view had been a pleasant, ignorable backdrop. A moving picture she had learned to tune out in favour of the serene certainty of a completed tax return. Her world was paper and ink, the satisfying tap of a calculator key, the hushed reverence of the archive room where the past was filed away in uniform cardboard sarcophagi. She was good at her job. So good, in fact, that her life outside of it had begun to take on the same neat, airless quality. Her fiancé, Gregory, was an estate agent, a man whose own ledgers were balanced with commissions and social capital. He was handsome in a glossy, marketable way, and he considered Eleanor a sound investment: stable, presentable, and blessedly uncomplicated.

The complication began on a Thursday. A perfectly ordinary Thursday in May, with a sky so blue it looked like a careless splash of paint. Abernathy & Codd was sponsoring a table at a charity luncheon at The Imperial Hotel. It was an obligation. Gregory was thrilled, of course. Networking opportunities bloomed for him in such environments like mould on a damp wall. Eleanor, buttoned into a sensible navy dress, felt the familiar sense of being an accessory. She smiled when Gregory touched her elbow, laughed dutifully at the mayor's terrible jokes, and sipped her warm Chardonnay. The grand ballroom was stifling, a fug of competing perfumes and baked salmon. Gregory, deep in conversation with a property developer, gestured vaguely towards the terrace. "Get some air, darling. You look a bit flushed."

She was grateful for the escape. She pushed open the heavy French doors and stepped out. The change was instant. The drone of the ballroom faded, replaced by the cry of a distant gull and the soft slap of water against the stone foundations of the hotel far, far below. The terrace was a wide, tiled expanse with a wrought-iron railing, and it projected out over the cliff edge. The view was, by any objective measure, breathtaking. The whole of Torbay arced before her, a perfect crescent of blue fringed with the red soil of the cliffs. Boats, tiny as water-skimmers, traced white lines on the water. And it was all so very far down.

Eleanor walked to the railing, her sensible heels clicking on the tiles. She rested her hands on the cool iron. She’d seen this view a hundred times. It was on postcards, tea towels, the front of biscuit tins. It was Torquay. She looked down. Directly down. At the jagged rocks where the sea foamed and churned. And the world tilted. Not a gentle sway, but a violent, sickening lurch, as if a colossal hand had grabbed the hotel and shaken it. The ground wasn't there. It had been replaced by a swirling, malevolent emptiness that was pulling at her, sucking the air from her lungs. Her fingers, suddenly slick with sweat, felt as though they were slipping on the railing. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic prisoner demanding release. The sound in her ears was not the sea, but a roaring, rushing vacuum. An iron band tightened around her chest. I'm falling. The thought was not a thought at all, but a primal, screaming certainty. I am falling and I am going to die.

She didn't scream. The sound was trapped behind the knot of terror in her throat. She staggered backwards, her hands flying to her mouth, a strangled gasp escaping. She stumbled back against the wall of the hotel, sliding down it until she was crouched on the hot tiles, her head between her knees, trying to breathe. The world was a spinning kaleidoscope of blue sky, red cliff, and white foam. Balance. She needed to find the balance. Debit, credit. In, out. But the ledger was on fire.

"Eleanor?" Gregory’s voice was sharp with irritation. He was standing in the doorway, the property developer hovering behind him, an amused smirk on his face. "What on earth are you doing on the floor? People are staring."

She couldn't answer. She could only shake her head, her breath coming in ragged, ugly sobs.

"For God's sake," he hissed, stepping out and pulling her to her feet. His grip on her arm was tight, humiliating. "Pull yourself together. You're making a scene." He steered her back inside, past the curious faces, the whispers. He didn't ask what was wrong. He didn't seem to care. Her sudden, inexplicable malfunction was simply a social liability, a mark in the wrong column on his otherwise perfect day.

The terror did not recede. It simply went dormant, a monstrous lodger taking up residence in the back of her mind. The next morning at the office, she found she couldn't sit at her desk. The third-floor window, once a benign rectangle of light, was now a portal to that same swirling emptiness. The view of the harbour made her stomach clench. She felt the phantom sensation of falling, the same icy sweat prickling her hairline. After a miserable hour of pretending to work while surreptitiously keeping her back to the window, she made an excuse to Mr. Abernathy about a draft and a stiff neck and asked the office junior to help her move her desk so it faced the interior wall. Mr. Abernathy, a man who viewed any deviation from routine with deep suspicion, watched the entire process with his lips pursed. "Everything quite all right, Miss Vance?" he'd asked, his tone suggesting he already knew it wasn't.

Her world began to shrink. A client meeting in a fourth-floor office was rescheduled to a ground-floor coffee shop. An invitation to a friend's new loft apartment was politely declined. She started taking the long route home to avoid the steep hill of Park Lane, her car crawling through the backstreets rather than cresting the rise that offered a panoramic, and now terrifying, view of the town. Her home, a modest semi-detached villa with a small but lovingly tended garden, became her fortress. The ground floor was her kingdom. The upstairs, with its view over the neighbouring rooftops, was a place of anxiety she visited only when necessary, scurrying quickly away from the windows.

It was from the safety of her ground-floor kitchen that she began to notice the gardener. He wasn't new. He'd been coming for years, a silent, efficient presence who appeared every second Tuesday, leaving behind tidily weeded beds and perfectly edged lawns. His name was Silas. She knew this only because his name was on the invoices she dutifully paid online. She had never spoken more than a handful of words to him. Now, he was part of her safe, circumscribed view. She would watch him from behind the net curtains as she drank her tea. He was a man who seemed to be made of earth and sinew. Tall, but stooped from years of labour, with a face weathered like an old stone wall. His hands, large and calloused, were surprisingly gentle as they staked a delphinium or tied back a climbing rose. He moved with a slow, deliberate grace, an economy of motion that wasted nothing. He was utterly grounded. He never looked up. His entire focus was on the soil, the roots, the things that grew from the solid, dependable earth. He seemed to her a creature of a different element. While she felt the constant, treacherous pull of the air, he was tethered to the ground by an invisible, unbreakable chain. He never looked towards the house, never seemed to register her presence behind the glass, but she had the unsettling feeling that he saw everything.

Gregory, meanwhile, had decided on a course of action. He diagnosed her "episode" at the hotel as a "silly wobble" that needed to be stamped out before it became a habit. His approach was devoid of empathy, framed entirely in the language of brisk, masculine problem-solving.

"We're going out," he announced one Saturday, jingling his car keys. "We're going to get this sorted."

"Out where?" Eleanor asked, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach.

"You'll see. It's time to face this nonsense head-on."

He drove them towards Babbacombe, the cheerful seaside scenery feeling like a mockery of her internal state. He parked near the cliff railway, the famous funicular that ferried tourists down the precipitous drop to Oddicombe Beach. The little wooden carriages, descending at an impossibly steep angle, looked like coffins sliding into a grave.

"Oh no," she breathed, her hand flying to her throat. "Gregory, no. I can't."

"Don't be ridiculous, Eleanor. It's perfectly safe. Thousands of people do it every day. We're going down to the beach, we're having an ice cream, and we're coming back up. We are going to conquer this."

He grabbed her hand and began pulling her towards the ticket office. The world began to fragment again. The cheerful chatter of the tourists, the bright colours of their summer clothes, the smell of salt and vinegar—it all blurred into a threatening sensory soup. Her feet felt like lead. She could see the tracks, two thin metal lines disappearing over the edge into nothingness. The pulling sensation was back, ten times stronger. The cliff was a living thing, and it wanted her.

"I can't!" she cried, her voice high and thin. She tried to wrench her hand from his, her sensible shoes skidding on the pavement. "Please, Gregory, don't make me."

"Stop it," he ordered, his voice low and furious, his public smile firmly in place. "You're embarrassing me."

He got them to the front of the queue. A carriage was waiting, its doors open. Inside, a family with young children were laughing. To Eleanor, it looked like a cage dangling over hell. The operator, a bored-looking man in a faded blue uniform, gave them a cursory glance. Gregory tried to pull her forward, into the carriage. That's when she broke. A raw, animal wail tore from her throat. She threw her weight backwards, clawing at his arm, her carefully constructed composure shattering into a million pieces. She was no longer Eleanor Vance, Chartered Accountant. She was a terrified creature fighting for its life. People were staring, pointing. The children in the carriage went quiet.

Gregory let go of her as if she were red hot. His face was a mask of cold fury and utter mortification. He took a step back, brushing down his jacket as if to wipe her hysteria off him.

"I'm done," he said, his voice quiet but absolutely final. The surrounding noise seemed to fall away, leaving only his words hanging in the air. "I can't do this, Eleanor. I can't be with someone who is... broken."

He turned and walked away without a backward glance, leaving her standing there, sobbing and shaking, alone at the edge of the world.She did not know how long she stood there, a statue carved from shame at the head of the cliff railway. The cheerful holiday sounds had twisted into something mocking and cruel. Eventually, a kind of numb autopilot took over. She turned away from the precipice, her movements stiff and jerky, and began the long walk back towards her car. She kept her eyes fixed on the pavement, terrified that a stray glance to her right would reveal a gap between buildings, a glimpse of the bay, a sliver of that dreadful, beckoning emptiness. Each step was a conscious effort, a tiny victory against the urge to simply lie down on the ground and not get up. The world had become a treacherous landscape of potential drops: kerbstones were miniature cliffs, gutters were dark ravines. She was a stranger in her own town, an exile in the place she called home.

The drive back was a blur of clenched muscles and shallow breaths. She couldn't remember the journey, only the overwhelming relief of turning her key in her own front door. She stumbled inside, shutting the world out with a definitive click of the lock, and leaned her forehead against the cool wood of the door. The silence of the house rushed in to meet her. It was no longer a peaceful silence, but a hollow, ringing void where Gregory’s voice, his presence, his expectations, used to be. She slid down the door and sat on the welcome mat, the rough coir pressing into her legs, and the sobs she had been choking back since Babbacombe finally came, not in a torrent, but in a slow, agonising leak, like a pipe that had cracked deep inside the walls of a house. He was right. She was broken. The thought was a cold, smooth stone in her gut. An accountant's job was to identify and rectify errors, to fix what was broken. But this wasn't a misplaced decimal point. This was a fundamental flaw in the very structure of her being.

The next few days were a grey fog. She called the office and left a message on the machine, her voice a reedy whisper, claiming a sudden, virulent flu. The lie was flimsy, but it was all she had. She unplugged the telephone. She let Gregory’s inevitable emails about collecting his things go unread. Her world shrank to the ground floor of her house. The living room, the kitchen, the small downstairs lavatory. The staircase was a mountain leading to a land of peril, its windows looking out over the slope of the garden, over other people’s roofs, into the dreaded sky. At night, she didn't go to her bed but curled up under a blanket on the sofa, waking from fractured dreams of falling, her heart hammering, the phantom wind roaring in her ears. The ledger was ruined, soaked through with the ink of Gregory’s final, damning assessment. Debit: one fiancé. Debit: one career. Debit: one life. There were no corresponding credits. The entire system had collapsed.

It was on the following Tuesday that she heard the familiar rattle of the side gate. Silas. She had forgotten it was his day. A jolt of panic shot through her; a stranger was about to enter her sanctuary. She crept to the kitchen window, peering through the gap in the net curtains. There he was, wheeling his old barrow full of tools, his movements as unhurried and predictable as they had always been. He set down his things, took out a pair of shears, and began to deadhead the roses with a quiet focus that was almost hypnotic. He worked his way along the flowerbed that ran beneath the kitchen window, his back to the house. He was so close, just a pane of glass away. She watched his hands, gloved and stained with earth, as they moved among the thorns, snipping away the dead and dying blooms to make way for new growth. He was restoring order, a small, tangible piece of it, right outside her window.

For an hour, she just watched. His presence was a strange comfort. He asked nothing of her. He did not know she was broken. To him, she was merely the unseen occupant of the house whose lawn needed mowing. As he was packing up his tools, he paused. He was looking at the wisteria that climbed the wall beside the back door. It had been her pride and joy, but in the past weeks of her internal exile, it had been neglected, its new growth hanging in untidy, trailing whips. He looked at it for a long moment, his brow furrowed. Then, instead of heading for the gate, he walked to her back door. Eleanor froze, her heart leaping into her throat. He was going to knock. He was going to speak to her. She couldn't. She backed away from the window, pressing herself into the shadows of the pantry. The knock came, three solid, deliberate raps on the wood. It sounded like a summons from another world. The real world. Silence. Then, the gentle scrape of something being set down on the step, followed by the click of the side gate closing. He was gone. Trembling, she waited a full five minutes before inching towards the door and peering through its small glass pane. On her doorstep was a ball of green garden twine and a pair of secateurs, cleaned and oiled. He had left his tools for her. It wasn't an accusation. It was an offering. A quiet, practical suggestion that some things, at least, could still be tied up and made right.The tools sat on the doormat where she’d placed them, a silent reproach. For two days, she skirted around them as if they were a pair of sleeping animals that might bite. They were a question she didn't know how to answer. To pick them up was to accept a task, to engage with the world outside her sealed fortress, and she wasn't ready. The thought of the open sky, the vast, bottomless blue, was enough to send a tremor of the old panic through her. It was safer on the sofa, with a book she couldn't read and a cup of tea grown cold, listening to the house settle around her. But the image of the tools persisted, a small, practical anchor in the swirling chaos of her thoughts. They were solid, real. The secateurs had a wooden handle, worn smooth with use. The twine was coarse and smelled faintly of earth and sap. They were things meant for hands, for work, for connection.

On the third day, a Friday, the silence of the house became unbearable. It was no longer a comfort but an amplification of her own emptiness. Gregory’s face, tight with fury at the cliff railway, swam in her vision. *Broken*. The word echoed in the stillness. A hot, angry tear, a feeling she hadn't yet permitted herself, slipped down her cheek. She was not a shattered vase. She was not a faulty machine. She was a person, and a part of her railed against his easy, damning diagnosis. With a sudden, jerky movement, she stood up, walked to the back door, and scooped up the tools. The weight of the secateurs in her palm was grounding. She unlocked the door, her heart thudding a nervous rhythm against her ribs, and stepped out into the garden.

The air was soft and smelled of damp earth and the sweet, peppery scent of stocks from a neighbour's garden. She kept her eyes low, fixed on the overgrown flagstone path, on the weeds pushing up through the cracks, on the unruly tangle of the wisteria. It was a mess. The long, new tendrils snaked across the path and clawed at the window of the downstairs lavatory. It was a problem she could see, a chaos she could, perhaps, contain. She took a breath. In. Out. A debit of air, a credit of air. The old mantra felt flimsy, but it was something. She approached the plant, her sensible indoor shoes sinking slightly into the soft lawn. She found a long, trailing shoot, a whip of bright green that was questing for a new hold. She lifted the secateurs, the metal cool against her skin. For a moment her hand trembled. It felt like a monumental decision. Then she closed her hand, and the blades gave a satisfying *snip*. The shoot fell to the ground. It was a small, clean act of severance. An edit.

She worked for over an hour, her movements starting as hesitant and clumsy but gradually finding a rhythm. Snip, trim, gather. She unwound the ball of twine and began to tie the main stems to the guide wires on the wall, her fingers fumbling at first with the knots. Her focus narrowed until the whole world was reduced to this small patch of wall, this single living thing. She wasn't thinking of Gregory, or the office, or the terrifying, dizzying drop at the edge of the world. She was thinking only of the rebellious branch that needed taming, of the best place to tie a supporting loop, of the feel of the rough bark and the silky new leaves under her fingertips. Sweat beaded on her forehead and trickled down her temples. Her knees ached from crouching. Her hands, unused to such labour, were scratched and smeared with green. When she finally finished, she stepped back to survey her work. It wasn't perfect. A professional, Silas, would have done a neater job. But the wild chaos was gone. The plant was secured. The pathway was clear. Order, of a kind, had been restored.

She sank down onto the small wooden bench at the far end of the lawn, a place she hadn't sat in months. She was exhausted, but it was a clean, physical tiredness, not the soul-deep weariness of anxiety. From here, she could see the back of her house, solid and dependable. Her house, not theirs. Her garden. She looked at her hands, at the dirt beneath her fingernails. It was the soil from her own garden. She had, for the first time in weeks, imposed her will on her world and it had obeyed. Not with the sterile compliance of numbers on a page, but with the quiet grace of a living thing being guided back into shape. Silas hadn't fixed it for her. He hadn't stood over her and directed her. He had simply left the tools, a quiet expression of faith that she had it in her to do the work herself. A credit. A small, priceless entry on a new page, in a ledger whose rules she was only just beginning to learn. The sky above her was still a vast and terrifying expanse, but for now, sitting on her bench with her feet planted firmly on the grass, she felt tethered to the earth, and it was enough.The following Tuesday, she was waiting. A strange, nervous energy propelled her through the morning. She found the secateurs and the ball of twine on the doormat, where she had left them after bringing them inside. She wiped the blades of the secateurs with a soft cloth until they shone, and she smoothed the worn wooden handles with her thumb. The act felt intimate, a form of communication. She considered leaving them on the back step for him to find, a neat, reciprocal gesture that required no interaction. But the thought felt cowardly, an entry in the wrong column. This small transaction required a personal touch. She rehearsed the words in her head. *Thank you for the loan of the tools.* Simple. Direct. Yet the thought of speaking them, of drawing attention to herself and the fragile state he had witnessed without comment, made her stomach clench.

She was in the kitchen, watching through the net curtain, when she heard the familiar clatter of his barrow. He moved with the same unhurried economy, his presence as natural a part of the garden as the old apple tree. She took a deep breath, the way one might before diving into cold water, and opened the back door. She stepped out, the tools held in front of her like an offering. He was at the far end of the lawn, pulling the starter cord on his mower, and didn't see her at first. The engine sputtered but didn’t catch. In the sudden silence, he straightened up and turned, and his eyes met hers. Eleanor’s breath caught in her throat. She felt pinned by his gaze, exposed. He was a hundred feet away, but she felt as if he could see the tremor in her hand. He stood perfectly still for a moment, taking in the sight of her standing on her own back step, holding his tools. His gaze drifted from her face, to the secateurs, and then to the wall behind her, where the wisteria was now a neat tracery of green instead of a chaotic cascade.

He did not smile. A smile would have been an intrusion, a judgment. Instead, the deep lines around his eyes seemed to soften almost imperceptibly. He gave a single, sharp nod. It was a gesture of immense capacity; it contained acknowledgement, approval, and a complete lack of curiosity all at once. It said, *Job done. Good.* He then turned back to his mower, gave the cord another purposeful yank, and the engine roared to life, shattering the quiet tension. The moment was over. He had seen her, and he had not seen a broken thing. He had seen a person who had tidied her own wisteria. Eleanor retreated back into the kitchen, her heart beating a triumphant rhythm. She placed the tools on the drainer, the small debt now paid, her personal ledger, for the first time in weeks, showing a transaction that resulted in a clear and unambiguous profit.

Buoyed by this silent exchange, she began to see her garden not as a backdrop but as a project. Her world, once defined by the four walls of her ground-floor prison, expanded to the perimeter of her fence. Each day, she set herself a small, achievable task. One afternoon was spent clearing the stubborn, creeping buttercup from the strawberry patch. Another was dedicated to potting up the geraniums that had grown leggy and pale on the kitchen windowsill. She learned to distinguish the smooth, threatening leaves of bindweed from the harmless ground-cover of a periwinkle. Her hands, once soft and pale from a life of paper, grew tough. The skin on her palms calloused, and there was a permanent line of dark soil beneath her fingernails that no amount of scrubbing could fully remove. She found she didn't mind. The dirt was proof of her labour, a testament to her connection with something solid and real.

The intrusion from the other world, the world of heights and expectations, came on a Thursday in a crisp, cream-coloured envelope. The Abernathy & Codd letterhead was as familiar to her as her own signature. Her hand trembled as she slit it open with a kitchen knife. Mr. Abernathy’s handwriting was just as she remembered: precise, spidery, and utterly devoid of emotion. He hoped for her "swift recovery from this protracted illness," but the firm required "a degree of clarity" regarding her return. Her client files were being "temporarily reassigned" to ensure continuity of service. The unspoken message was clear: the machine was moving on, and her cog was in danger of being discarded entirely. The phantom lurch returned, a sickening drop in the pit of her stomach. The third-floor office, the clinking masts in the harbour, the dizzying view—it all rushed back, and she gripped the edge of the kitchen counter to steady herself.

Her first instinct was to retreat to the sofa, to pull the blanket over her head and let the grey fog descend again. But the smell of damp earth drifted in through the open back door, a scent that had become her new reality. Instead of retreating, she walked outside, the letter still clutched in her hand. She stood in the middle of the lawn, the perfectly mown stripes a testament to Silas’s recent visit. She looked at the letter, at the neat black ink that laid out the potential dissolution of her professional life. It was just paper. It was a debit she could not, at this moment, balance. So she would file it differently. She walked to the far corner of the garden, to the wooden compost bin tucked behind the shed. She tore the letter into small, deliberate squares, and dropped them in amongst the grass clippings and potato peelings. She was not solving the problem, but she was choosing the ground on which she would stand. For now, this was her work. The accounts of Abernathy & Codd could wait.

Two weeks later, on his next visit, Silas concluded his work and packed away his tools, but he didn't leave immediately. Eleanor, who was washing soil from a clutch of freshly dug new potatoes at the outdoor tap, watched him with a wary curiosity. He walked over to a parched, neglected patch of earth by the side of the house that got the full glare of the afternoon sun. He scuffed at the dry, cracked soil with the toe of his boot, then looked over at her. "Lavender," he said. It was the first time she had heard him speak more than one word. His voice was a low rumble, like stones shifting underground. He pointed a thick finger at the spot. "Likes it dry. Full sun. Good for the bees." He didn't wait for a reply. He simply turned and walked to the gate, letting himself out with a quiet click.

The following morning, Eleanor undertook her most ambitious expedition yet. She found her purse, checked she had her keys, and walked out of her front door. She kept to the quiet residential streets, her gaze fixed firmly on the pavement in front of her, her senses on high alert for any sudden, plunging views between houses. The walk to the local garden centre was only ten minutes, but it felt like a journey across a continent. The centre itself was a vast, barn-like structure, and the sheer space was daunting, but the roof was low and the ground was reassuringly flat. She found the lavender, a sea of fragrant purple, and chose a tray of six small, healthy-looking plants. The transaction at the till felt momentous, a purchase for a future she was only just beginning to imagine. Back in her garden, her fortress, she knelt on the ground at the spot Silas had indicated. With a trowel, she broke through the hard-packed earth, her hands mixing the dry soil with fresh compost. She settled each plant into its new home, firming the earth around its roots with a gentle pressure. When she had finished, she sat back on her heels, her whole body aching with a satisfying weariness. She had created a new column in her ledger, a row of fragrant, living things. The sun was beginning to set, casting a soft, forgiving light across the garden. She looked at her small row of lavender, and slowly, deliberately, lifted her head. Her eyes travelled up the warm brick of her house, past the first-floor window, and settled for a brief, breathless moment on the sharp line of the roof against the pale evening sky. The world held. There was no lurch, no sickening pull. There was only the roof, the sky, and the solid ground beneath her knees. It was not a victory, but it was a truce.The truce held. Summer settled over Torquay, thick and golden, draping itself over the town in a heat haze that softened the sharp edges of the world. For Eleanor, the season was measured not by weeks on a calendar but by the progress in her garden. It was marked by the fattening of the first green gooseberries, the triumphant unfurling of a rose she’d nursed back from black spot, and the deepening purple of the lavender that now hummed with the constant industry of bees. Her days fell into a new, quieter rhythm. She rose with the sun, her first act not to balance accounts but to step out into the dew-damp garden, to see what had changed in the night. The world above the fence line remained a territory she navigated with caution, her gaze instinctively dropping if it strayed too high, but the fear was a background hum now, not a deafening roar. Her domain was here, within these boundaries of wood and hedge, a kingdom of soil and leaf.

The accountant in her had not died, it had simply found a new vocation. She bought a thick, blank-paged notebook and began a new kind of ledger. Down one side of a page, she would list her assets: ‘Six lavender plants (established)’, ‘One punnet of strawberry runners (showing new growth)’, ‘Wisteria (pruned and tied)’. On the facing page, the liabilities: ‘Aphids on Rosa Mundi’, ‘Bindweed infestation by back fence’, ‘Patch of sour, un-dug soil’. Each day she recorded rainfall in millimetres, hours of sunshine, tasks completed. The numbers were no longer sterile figures on a tax form; they were tied to the tangible world of growth and decay. It was double-entry bookkeeping for the soul. The satisfaction of drawing a neat line through ‘Aphids on Rosa Mundi’ after a diligent campaign with soapy water far surpassed any tax return she had ever completed. This balance sheet was alive.

On his next visit, Silas found her on her knees by the vegetable patch, the open ledger propped on a stone beside her, as she meticulously recorded the germination of a row of carrots. She felt his shadow fall over her and looked up, flustered, feeling caught in some private, foolish act. He stood for a moment, his gaze taking in the notebook, her dirt-streaked face, the neat rows of tiny green shoots. He looked, she thought, like a man reading a familiar language. He gave no sign of amusement or surprise, only that same quiet, considering stillness. Later, when he was leaving, she found he had left something by her back door. It was not a tool this time, but a single plant in a small, black plastic pot. It was a young tomato plant, sturdy and green, with the faint, sharp smell of summer clinging to its leaves. There was no note. None was needed. It was an assignment. It was a vote of confidence.

The call came on a Tuesday afternoon. She had finally reconnected the telephone, a necessary concession to the world, but she still flinched whenever it rang. She answered on the third ring, her voice a little breathless. "Eleanor? Good Lord, I was about to send out a search party! It's Fiona." Fiona’s voice was like a cocktail party condensed into a soundwave – bright, loud, and full of tinkling ice. "We all thought you’d fallen off the face of the earth. Abernathy was being terribly mysterious. And Gregory, well. He’s been an absolute brute, telling everyone you had some sort of public meltdown. Honestly, men. Anyway, he’s already seeing that dreadful woman from the marketing department, the one with the teeth. You’ve had a lucky escape, if you ask me. We’re all going for drinks at The Orangerie on Friday, you must come. It has a new rooftop terrace, the views are meant to be utterly divine."

Every cheerful, carelessly thrown word was a stone hitting glass. Rooftop terrace. Divine views. The Orangerie was on the fifth floor. Eleanor’s hand tightened on the receiver, her knuckles white. She could feel the bottom dropping out of her stomach, the familiar, horrible sensation of plunging. "I… I can’t, Fiona," she managed, her voice thin. "I’m not well." There was a fractional pause. "Oh, darling, still? You can’t just hide away forever. You need to get back on the horse! A good dose of Chardonnay and gossip is the best medicine." The chasm between Fiona’s world and her own was suddenly absolute, an unbridgeable canyon. She mumbled an excuse, a promise to call back that they both knew was a lie, and gently replaced the receiver.

The silence that rushed back in was poisoned. The garden, her sanctuary, suddenly felt like a beautifully curated prison. Fiona’s words had punched a hole in the fragile peace she had built, letting the old world in with all its judgments and expectations. *Hide away forever. Meltdown. Broken.* She stumbled to the French doors and looked out at her small, green kingdom. It felt pathetic, a child’s game. The urge to run upstairs, to fling open the bedroom window and force herself to look out, to either conquer the fear or be consumed by it, was a terrifying, seductive whisper. Her eyes filled with hot, angry tears. Instead of going up, she went out. She walked, almost blindly, to the place on the patio where she had placed the tomato plant. She knelt before it, the small pot a point of focus in her spinning world. It was a living thing. It needed water. It needed a bigger pot. It needed sun. It needed her. Its needs were simple, real, and blessedly free of judgment. The simple, physical requirements of the small plant were an anchor, and slowly, shakily, she felt herself being pulled back to solid ground.

The plant needed repotting, and she was out of compost. The two bags she had bought weeks ago were empty. For a full day, she put off the inevitable, trying to convince herself she could make do with the soil in the garden, but she knew it wasn’t right. The plant, this silent gift from Silas, deserved better. This was not a test imposed by Gregory, a demand that she perform a cure. This was a practical problem demanding a practical solution. The garden centre was a flat, ten-minute walk away. No cliffs, no bridges, no harbour views. It was, she told herself, just a transaction. On Thursday morning, when the roads were quiet, she put on her sturdiest walking shoes, took her purse, and locked her front door behind her. Her heart hammered a nervous beat, but she focused on a new mantra. Not debit and credit, but left foot, right foot. She kept her gaze fixed on the details of the ground: the intricate pattern of moss on a garden wall, a line of determined ants crossing the pavement, the different colours of the paving stones. She was an explorer in a familiar land, mapping it not by its vistas but by its textures.

The garden centre was a low, sprawling building, smelling of damp soil and fertiliser. She kept her head down, found the towering stack of compost bags, heaved one onto a trolley, and made for the checkout. The girl at the till barely looked at her. It was an anonymous, blessedly simple exchange of money for goods. The walk home was harder, the heavy bag bumping against her leg, a constant, awkward weight. But with every step, a feeling of quiet, fierce pride began to build. She was moving through the world. She was carrying her own weight. When her own house came into view at the end of the street, it looked different. Not a fortress to hide in, but a destination she had chosen, a home she had successfully returned to. She unlocked her door and hauled the compost bag through into the garden, dropping it with a thud on the flagstones. She leaned against the doorframe, breathless from exertion, and looked at the bag of rich, dark earth. It was a liability she had carried, and an asset she had earned. The ledger, for the first time, felt like it was truly hers to balance.The weight of the compost bag was a dense, satisfying anchor. The next morning, Eleanor dragged it to the centre of the patio and slit it open with a kitchen knife. A rich, dark, loamy smell billowed out, the scent of a thousand things dying and being reborn as potential. It was the antithesis of the sterile, air-conditioned stillness of the Abernathy & Codd archives. This was a ledger of a different kind, one of decay and regeneration, and it felt infinitely more honest. She found a large terracotta pot that had been sitting empty by the shed, its sides greened with a fine layer of moss. She filled it with the new compost, her hands plunging into the cool, crumbly earth. The act was so absorbing, so completely physical, that the lingering chill of Fiona’s phone call began to recede, replaced by a sense of purpose.

She gently eased the tomato plant from its small plastic container. Its roots were a fine, white web, already questing for more space. She settled it into its new home, building up the soil around its stem with a tenderness that surprised her. This small, living thing was now her responsibility. Its future growth depended on this act, on this provision of a stable, nourishing environment. She watered it carefully, watching the dark soil drink and settle. The plant, which had looked so robust in its small pot, now seemed tiny and vulnerable in the vastness of the new one. It needed support. The thought came to her with the simple clarity of a mathematical proof. Left on its own, its future weight of fruit would break it. It needed a stake. A structure to hold on to as it grew towards the sun.

She was considering the problem of a suitable stake when the familiar sound of Silas’s barrow came from the side of the house. This time, she did not retreat. She remained on her knees on the patio, her hands still covered in soil, a proprietary guardian of the plant he had given her. He came into view, his walk as measured as ever, and stopped when he saw her. His gaze fell upon the newly potted tomato plant, and for the first time, a flicker of something approximating a smile touched the corner of his mouth. It was a brief, subtle shift in the landscape of his face, but to Eleanor, it felt like a seismic event.

“Needs a cane,” he said, his voice the same low rumble. He gestured with his chin towards her shed. “You’ll have some in there. From the old raspberries.”

Eleanor stood up, wiping her earthy hands on the sides of her trousers. “Yes. I was just thinking that.” The conversation felt startlingly normal. Two people, in a garden, discussing a plant. She went to the shed, the door creaking on its rusty hinges, and rummaged behind a lawnmower and a tangle of old hosepipe. She found them: a bundle of bamboo canes of varying lengths, tied together with perished string. She pulled one out. It was about four feet long. She brought it out to him, holding it up for inspection.

He took it from her, his large, calloused hand dwarfing hers for a second. He weighed it, tested its flex, and looked from the plant to the wall of the house behind it. “This’ll do for a start,” he said. “But it’ll grow taller. It’ll want all the sun it can get against that wall. You’ll need a taller one eventually. Maybe six feet.” He handed the cane back to her. “Push it in deep, close to the stem. Be careful you don’t damage the roots.” And with that, the lesson was over. He turned to his own work, leaving her to it. He had not offered to do it for her. He had given her the information she needed and trusted her to complete the task.

She took the cane and pushed it into the soft compost, feeling for the right depth. Then she found her ball of green garden twine and, with gentle fingers, tied a loose figure-eight loop, securing the plant’s slender stem to the bamboo. She stepped back, her head tilted. The plant no longer looked vulnerable. It looked ready. It had a structure. It had a direction. Silas’s words echoed in her mind. *It’ll grow taller… You’ll need a taller one eventually.* She looked at the four-foot cane, and then her eyes travelled upwards, up the warm brick of the house, tracing the path the plant would take. Her gaze passed the level of the kitchen window, then the downstairs lavatory. It climbed towards the windowsill of her own bedroom, a place she hadn't been in daylight for weeks. Her breath caught. The familiar, sickening lurch started in her gut, a ghost of the terror on the terrace. The sky above the roofline seemed to press down, vast and empty. The pull was still there.

She dropped her gaze instantly, her heart starting to hammer. She stared hard at the pot, at the dark earth, at the small green leaves. *Solid ground,* she told herself, the words a frantic mantra. *You are on solid ground.* She took a deep, shuddering breath, then another. The panic receded, leaving her shaky and weak. But she hadn’t run inside. She hadn't collapsed. She was still standing in her garden. Slowly, deliberately, she forced herself to look up again. Not at the sky. Just at the wall. She let her eyes rest on the mortar between the bricks on the first floor. She focused on a hairline crack near the window frame. She saw it not as a part of a terrifying height, but as a feature of her house, a flaw that needed monitoring, like black spot on a rose. It was data. She was on the ground. It was up there. There was a space between them. For the first time, it did not feel like a malevolent void, but simply a distance. She held her gaze there for five long seconds before looking away, a fine sheen of sweat on her forehead. It wasn't a victory. But it wasn't a defeat. It was a successful transaction, a risk assessed and managed. That evening, in her new ledger, she made an entry. In the assets column, she wrote: ‘One tomato plant, potted and staked.’ And below it, in smaller, neater script, she added: ‘Height of house wall: observed.’The tomato plant became the sun around which Eleanor’s small world now revolved. Each morning, before her tea, she would go out to the patio to inspect it. Her new ledger, a thick notebook with a reassuringly plain brown cover, was her constant companion. In it, she recorded the plant's daily progress with the same precision she had once reserved for share dividends and capital gains. ‘July 12th: Height 47cm. Two new leaf axils noted. First flower truss visible.’ ‘July 15th: Five flowers open on first truss. Weather: overcast, light rain overnight (est. 3mm).’ The numbers were no longer abstract; they were measurements of life. When the first tiny, fuzzy green spheres began to form where the yellow flowers had been, she felt a surge of quiet, fierce joy that no balanced budget had ever given her. It was a tangible profit, a return on an investment of care and compost.

The plant was vigorous. It seemed to draw strength directly from the sun that beat down on the south-facing wall, and its main stem thickened, its leaves grew broad and dark. It was quickly approaching the top of its four-foot bamboo cane. Silas’s words, spoken weeks ago, echoed in her mind with the weight of prophecy. *You’ll need a taller one eventually. Maybe six feet.* She went to the shed and pulled out the bundle of old canes she had found. She measured them against the wall. The longest was a fraction over five feet. It felt inadequate, a compromise. This project, her project, deserved the correct equipment. An entry of ‘sub-standard materials’ was not one she was willing to make. The plant needed a six-foot cane, and she would have to go and find one.

The thought of the expedition was daunting. The small, local garden centre was one thing; a ten-minute walk through quiet streets she could map with her eyes on the ground. But they sold canes only in bundled packs of ten. She needed a single, sturdy one. Her mind, a reluctant archivist of the town’s geography, dredged up a memory: Dyer’s Emporium. It was an old-fashioned hardware shop in the heart of the town centre, a place that sold everything from nails by the ounce to paraffin and proper bamboo stakes. But the town centre was a landscape of potential horrors. It meant taller buildings, busier roads, and, to get to Dyer’s from the bus stop, the almost certain necessity of crossing the pedestrian overpass near the clock tower. The image of it rose in her mind: a high, concrete walkway, suspended over the ceaseless traffic, with only a low railing between the pedestrian and the drop. The familiar, sickening lurch began in her stomach. For two days, the ledger lay open on her kitchen table. On one side: Asset – continued health and vertical growth of *Lycopersicon esculentum*. On the other: Liability – pedestrian overpass and associated sensory trauma. The columns remained stubbornly unbalanced.

On the third day, she woke to find that the leading shoot of the tomato plant was curling around the very top of its stake, questing for the next handhold. It could not wait. The plant’s need was more immediate than her fear. She dressed in what she thought of as her armour: flat, sensible shoes, a pair of old trousers, and a nondescript jacket with deep pockets to jam her hands into. The bus journey was an exercise in controlled observation. She deliberately chose a seat on the landward side, forcing herself to study the peeling paint on the back of the seat in front of her, the scuffed patterns on the floor, the text of the advertisements that ran in a strip above the windows. She catalogued each detail, turning the journey into an inventory of the immediate and the mundane, refusing to acknowledge the vast, glittering expanse of the bay that she knew was sliding past on the other side of the glass.

The town centre was a cacophony. The roar of traffic, the chatter of shoppers, the distant chime of the clock tower – it all merged into a threatening wall of sound. She got off the bus and kept her head down, her gaze fixed on the paving stones ahead. And then she saw it. The pedestrian overpass. It was just as she remembered, a stark concrete bridge arching over the dual carriageway. People ambled across it without a second thought, pushing prams, chatting on their phones. To Eleanor, it looked like a gallows. She took a few steps towards the bottom of the ramp, and the world began to tilt. The roar of the traffic below became the roaring of the vacuum in her ears. The ground felt as though it was falling away, the concrete beneath her feet turning to treacherous sand. *I can’t.* The thought was a physical blow. She staggered back, stumbling against the wall of a building, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Shame burned in her cheeks. People were glancing at her, a strange woman hyperventilating against a shop front. Broken. The word was a clang of iron in her head. She had failed.

She leaned against the cool glass of the shop window, her eyes squeezed shut, fighting for control. Debit: one overpass. Liability: unconquerable. The assessment was absolute. But then, a different part of her mind, the stubborn, logical part that had spent a decade finding ways around intractable tax laws, kicked in. If you cannot go over an obstacle, you find a route around it. This was not the only way. She forced her eyes open, her gaze still low, and scanned the street. There. Tucked between a betting shop and a jeweller’s was a narrow alleyway. She remembered it now, a grim little shortcut that led to the backstreets. And the backstreets led to the underpass, the dingy, echoing tunnel that went *under* the main road. It was longer. It was darker. But it was on the ground. It was a solution. With a new sense of resolve, she pushed herself off the wall and plunged into the alleyway. The subway smelled of damp concrete and faint disinfectant, and the sound of her footsteps echoed around her, but the low, solid roof above her head was the most beautiful sight in the world. When she emerged into the daylight on the other side, she was no longer a failure. She was an accountant who had successfully identified and executed a viable workaround.

Dyer’s Emporium was a haven of organised chaos. It smelled of metal, wood, and packed earth. Every surface was crammed with tools, pots, and mysterious packets of seeds. An elderly man with flour-dusted eyebrows listened to her request, disappeared into a forest of rakes and shovels, and returned with a perfect, smooth bamboo cane. It was exactly six feet long. The simple transaction, the exchange of a few coins for this perfect, tangible object, felt profoundly significant. Carrying the cane back through the town felt different. It was awkward and unwieldy, but she held it like a standard, a long, thin declaration of her purpose. It was proof that she had ventured into the world and retrieved what she needed.

She was utterly exhausted when she got home, but a triumphant energy propelled her into the garden. She pulled the heavy pot away from the wall, carefully pushed the tall new cane deep into the compost, right beside the old one. With painstaking care, she untied the delicate green stems from the short stake and retied them to their new, taller support. The plant, now secured, looked magnificent. Its leading shoot was already inches from the bottom of her bedroom windowsill. A few days later, she was weeding the lavender bed when Silas arrived. He went about his work as usual, but as he was packing up, he stopped and stood for a long moment, looking at the tomato plant. His eyes travelled up the length of the new cane, all the way to the top. He looked over at her, where she knelt by the lavender, and he caught her eye. He gave the nod. It was infinitesimally slower than usual, a gesture of quiet consideration. It did not just say, *Job done*. It said, *You found a way.*

That evening, as dusk bled purple into the sky, Eleanor sat on her bench and opened her ledger. She recorded the purchase and installation of the cane. Then, under the Liabilities column, she wrote: ‘Pedestrian overpass, 19th July.’ She paused, then drew a neat, firm line through the words. In the facing Assets column, she wrote: ‘Alternative route (discovered and utilised).’ The account was balanced. She closed the book and looked at her house. Her eyes followed the strong, dark line of the bamboo as it rose up the wall, a ladder waiting to be climbed. Her gaze came to rest on the white-painted sill of her bedroom window, just feet from the top of the cane. The world held steady. Her heart beat a calm, even rhythm. The distance no longer felt like a void. It felt like a space waiting to be occupied, a goal to be grown towards. The truce was solidifying into a plan.The sun of late July was a relentless accountant, tallying hours of heat against the wall where the tomato plant grew with an almost defiant vigour. It had become a vertical green river, flowing up the six-foot cane, its side-shoots pushing out like tributaries exploring new territory. Eleanor, in turn, had become its devoted hydrologist, charting its flow, measuring its gains. The first truss of fruit, low on the stem, had begun to blush from green to a pale, promising orange. But with this burgeoning success came new vulnerabilities. One morning, her daily inspection revealed a darkness that did not belong. On some of the lower leaves, brown-edged spots had appeared, haloed with a sickly yellow. A familiar kind of dread, the accountant’s fear of an unforeseen error that could bankrupt the entire enterprise, tightened in her chest. Her gardening books confirmed it: blight. A fungal disease that, if left unchecked, would spread through the plant like a lie, rotting it from the inside out. The remedy was brutal and immediate: excise the infected parts, create air circulation, and hope for the best.

The first few infected leaves were easy, within comfortable reach. She snipped them off with her secateurs, her movements precise and unforgiving, dropping the diseased foliage into a paper bag for burning. But the blight was insidious. Over the next few days, new spots appeared higher up, just beyond her reach, then higher still. She could see a cluster of them now, a good five feet from the ground, just below the second truss of fruit. They were a mockery, flourishing in a zone her fear had cordoned off as uninhabitable. For a day, she did nothing, circling the problem, her anxiety a buzzing, unproductive hum. She considered leaving it, sacrificing the top of the plant to save the bottom, but the thought felt like a capitulation, a cowardly retreat to the safety of the ground floor. The plant was growing towards the sun, and she had promised to be its steward. It was an unacceptable liability.

Her shed held the answer, and the terror. Tucked behind a stack of old deckchairs was a small, wooden A-frame stepladder, left by the house’s previous owner. It was paint-spattered and dusty, and when she unfolded it, the hinges gave a geriatric groan of protest. It was a man-made device for the express purpose of defying gravity, a temporary, unstable piece of architecture. She placed it on the flagstones of the patio, a few feet from the plant. It looked flimsy, skeletal. She stared at it, her heart thumping a heavy, fearful rhythm. The memory of the lurching terrace at The Imperial, the pulling void, was a physical presence beside her. But then she looked at the brown spots on the leaves, a tangible, solvable problem. It was a simple equation of risk and reward. One she had to solve.

Her first attempt was a failure. She placed a foot on the bottom step, a ridiculously small elevation of no more than eight inches, and the world swam. The solid flagstones seemed to shift, and she scrambled back down as if the wood were hot, her breath catching in her throat. She retreated to the safety of her kitchen bench, shaking. It was impossible. But from the window, she could see the ladder still standing there, an unanswered question. And beyond it, the plant, with its spreading sickness. That evening, in her ledger, she made no entry at all. The page for the day remained blank, a testament to her paralysis. The next morning, fueled by a night of restless dreams and a new, cold anger at her own limitations, she went out again. This time, she did not look down. She did not look up. Her entire focus was on the cluster of blighted leaves. Her mission was not to climb a ladder; it was to perform a necessary surgery. She gripped the sides of the ladder, took a breath, and stepped onto the first rung. Then the second. She was now a foot and a half off the ground, a terrifying altitude. But her hand, holding the secateurs, was steady. She reached out, her body braced, and snipped the first leaf. It fell to the ground. She snipped another. And another. The world narrowed to the small, precise movements of her hand, the click of the blades, the satisfying severance of the sick from the healthy.

She needed to go higher. The next cluster was another foot up. With her gaze still locked on her target, she moved her foot to the third step. Her head was now level with her bedroom windowsill. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her own reflection in the glass: a woman she barely recognised, her face grim with concentration, her hair escaping its clip, a smudge of soil high on one cheek. She did not look like Eleanor Vance, Chartered Accountant. She looked like a labourer, a field hand, someone utterly engaged with the physical world. She saw, reflected in the glass, the familiar shape of the lamp on her bedside table. The room looked quiet, dormant, a place she hadn't inhabited for an age. For a second, the duality of her position struck her: she was outside, clinging to a precarious structure, looking in at a place that was supposed to be her sanctuary. And yet, she felt more solid, more real, out here on the ladder than she ever did cowering inside.

It was then that she heard the rattle of the side gate. Silas. A hot wave of shame and panic washed over her. He would see her like this, a trembling amateur perched three feet off the ground, playing at being a gardener. She froze, her hand hovering in mid-air, a blighted leaf just out of reach. She wanted to scurry down, to pretend she hadn’t been up there at all, but she was trapped. He wheeled his barrow onto the lawn and his movements stilled. He saw her. She couldn't read his expression from this distance, but she braced herself for a comment, a word of caution, a look of pity. He did none of those things. He walked over, his heavy boots making no sound on the grass. He stopped not at the plant, but at the base of the ladder. He looked down at its four feet, then glanced at the flagstones beneath. Without looking up at her, he nudged one of the ladder’s legs with the toe of his boot, a tiny, almost imperceptible adjustment to settle it more firmly on the uneven stone. Then he straightened up, gave a single, sharp tug on the starter cord of his mower, and the engine roared to life, filling the garden with its mundane and reassuring noise. He had not judged her. He had not helped her. He had simply checked her foundations.

A surge of something powerful and new—gratitude, courage, sheer bloody-mindedness—shot through Eleanor. She took a breath, reached out, and snipped the final diseased leaf. She stayed there for a moment, on the third step, her knuckles white where she gripped the frame, and just breathed. The roar of the mower, the smell of cut grass, the solid feel of the wood beneath her feet—it was all real. The fear was real, too, but it no longer filled the entire space. It was just one entry among many. Carefully, deliberately, she climbed back down, her feet finding solid ground with a sense of profound relief and accomplishment. That evening, her hand was perfectly steady as she opened her ledger. In the Assets column, she wrote: ‘Blight outbreak contained. Vertical access achieved via three-step apparatus.’ In the Liabilities column, she simply wrote: ‘Altitude.’ She did not cross it out. It was a fixed condition of the world, like rainfall or soil acidity. A factor to be managed, not a debt to be erased. She closed the book and walked to the bottom of her staircase. Her hand rested on the cool, smooth wood of the newel post. She looked up, past the turn in the stairs, to the landing on the first floor. It was just a space. A wooden floor, a hallway, a door leading to a room. For the first time in a very long time, it did not look like the edge of a cliff. It looked like the next step.The newel post was her base camp. For two days after the incident with the ladder, Eleanor would walk to the bottom of the stairs and simply stand there, her hand resting on the smooth, polished wood. She was taking its measure, assessing the route. The staircase was no longer an abstract cliff face, a feature of a terrifying mental map. It was a physical object, a series of thirteen carpeted steps, turning ninety degrees at a small landing before rising another five to the first floor. It was an engineering problem. She broke it down into its component parts, just as she would a complex corporate account. Each step was a transaction. To place a foot on the first riser was a debit of courage; to lift the other foot to join it was the balancing credit.

On the third day, she began the ascent. She did not think about the top, nor did she allow herself to glance back at the ground floor shrinking behind her. Her entire universe was the small circle of her immediate focus. Her hand slid up the mahogany banister, her fingers tracing the familiar contours. Her eyes were fixed on the weave of the runner, a faded floral pattern she had never truly seen before. She noted a small, dark stain on the seventh step, probably from a spilled cup of tea years ago, and a place on the turn where the pile was worn almost bare. She was not climbing; she was conducting an audit. Her breath was a steady, rhythmic accounting, in and out, in and out. The roaring vacuum in her ears was silent, replaced by the soft thud of her own heart and the whisper of the carpet under her sensible shoes. When her foot touched the solid floor of the upstairs landing, the sense of arrival was so profound it was almost dizzying. She had reached the summit.

The air on the first floor was different, thick with the stale scent of dust and disuse. It was the atmosphere of a room sealed against a plague, a place where time had stopped. She stood on the landing, her back firmly against the wall, orienting herself. There were three doors. The bathroom, the small spare room, and ahead of her, the door to her bedroom. Her bedroom. The word itself felt alien. For months it had been a place of dread, its window a portal to the abyss. Now it was just a door. She walked towards it, her footsteps loud in the oppressive silence, and turned the handle. The room was dim, the curtains drawn against the sun. A film of dust coated every surface, dulling the sheen of the mahogany wardrobe and the silver frame of a photograph on the bedside table. The photograph was of her and Gregory, smiling at some long-forgotten garden party, their faces bright and unlined with future failures. She looked at the woman in the picture, her sensible navy dress so similar to the one she’d worn at The Imperial, and felt a complete and utter disconnect, as if looking at a stranger.

Her gaze was drawn, irresistibly, to the window. It was a large sash window, currently closed, its net curtains obscuring the view. This was the final obstacle. This was the high-wire walk. She could feel the old fear begin to stir, a cold tingling in her fingertips. But she thought of Silas, nudging the foot of the ladder with his boot. Check your foundations. Her feet were on a solid floor. Her house was built on a solid street. The ground was still there, even if she couldn't see it. She took a breath and walked towards the light, her movements slow and deliberate. She did not fling the curtains open. She reached out and parted the net fabric with two fingers, creating a narrow vertical slit, a keyhole through which to view the world. Her first glimpse was not of the sky or the ground, but a patch of green. She widened the gap. It was the top of the old apple tree at the bottom of the garden. She could see a blackbird perched on a high branch, its head cocked. It was just a tree, just a bird.

Emboldened, she pulled the net curtain aside completely. And there it was. Her garden. But not the garden she knew from the ground. From up here, it was a map, a blueprint laid out for her inspection. She could see the perfect, satisfying curve she had edged along the lawn. She could see the block of purple lavender, a haze of colour against the fence. She could see the neat rows of her vegetable patch and the bright, defiant heads of the geraniums on the patio. And she could see her tomato plant, a strong, dark green line rising triumphantly against the brickwork, its stake a declaration of intent. Everything was in its place. Every asset was accounted for. From this height, she saw not a terrifying void, but the sum of all her work. The perspective that had once promised only oblivion now offered clarity.

Her eyes followed the line of the bamboo cane downwards. Down past the flourishing trusses of fruit, past the newly pruned lower leaves, all the way down to the terracotta pot on the flagstones below. She was looking directly down. The distance was real, a clear ten feet or more. A faint, ghostly echo of the lurch went through her, a muscular memory of panic. But it had no power. The ground she was looking at was not an anonymous, rocky shore. It was her patio. She could see the small crack in the stone next to the pot. She could see the spot where the ladder had stood. It was her territory, a landscape she had cultivated and understood. Her connection to the rich, dark soil in that pot was stronger than the empty pull of the air between. She was not suspended over a void; she was simply looking down at her own good work. A slow smile spread across Eleanor’s face. It was the first genuine smile she had felt in months, a spreading warmth that started deep inside. She reached out, unlatched the window, and pushed the lower sash upwards. Fresh air, smelling of cut grass and warm earth, flooded the stale room, and she breathed it in like a long-awaited pardon. That night, for the first time since May, she stripped the dusty cover from her bed, put on fresh sheets, and slept in her own room. The window was open just a crack, and the quiet night sounds of her garden were the most reassuring lullaby she had ever known.August arrived, and the tomato plant became a study in glorious, unchecked capitalism. The single flower truss had been followed by a second, then a third, and now the entire plant was laden with fruit in all stages of development, from hard green pellets to heavy, blushing globes of orange and red. The lowest truss, the first to ripen, held three tomatoes of a deep, uniform crimson, their skins stretched taut and glossy over their swelling flesh. They were perfect. In Eleanor’s ledger, she drew a thick line under the weeks of data logging – the rainfall, the staking, the pest control – and on a fresh line, under the Assets column, she wrote: ‘First Dividend.’ The word felt precisely right. This was the tangible profit from her long and anxious investment. She took a small, sharp knife from the kitchen, and with the reverence of a priestess performing a rite, she cut the first tomato from the vine. It felt surprisingly heavy in her palm, warm from the sun. She held it to her nose and breathed in its scent – a wild, green, earthy perfume that was the very essence of summer.

It was a Tuesday. She washed the three ripe tomatoes and placed them in a small bowl, their colour a splash of fierce life against the plain white ceramic. Her first instinct was to leave the bowl on the back step for Silas, a silent, anonymous gesture of thanks. It was the old Eleanor’s way: a neat transaction that required no messy human contact. But the woman who had climbed the ladder, the woman who had opened her bedroom window, knew that some debts required a personal settlement. When she heard the familiar rumble of his mower falling silent, she took the bowl and stepped out onto the patio. He was wiping his brow with the back of a weathered hand, his back to her. “Silas,” she said. Her voice was quiet, but it carried in the warm, still air. He turned slowly, his expression unreadable. She walked towards him, holding out the bowl. “I thought you might like some of these,” she said. “The first of them.” He looked from her face to the tomatoes, his gaze lingering on their perfect, sun-warmed skins. For a moment, he just looked, and she had the strange feeling that he was seeing not just the fruit, but the entire story of its cultivation: the trip to the hardware store, the battle with the blight, the small, brave ascent of the stepladder. He reached out and took one, his large, earth-stained thumb brushing against her fingers. The contact was brief, accidental, but it felt like the signing of a treaty. He held the tomato in his palm, weighing it, just as he had weighed the cane. “Thank you, miss,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “They’ve done well.” He didn’t say *you’ve* done well. He said *they’ve* done well, a subtle, crucial distinction that gave the credit to the plant, the sun, the soil, absolving her of the need for either pride or modesty. He simply acknowledged the successful outcome, the balanced account. He nodded once, a gesture of completion, and turned back to his work.

Later that afternoon, Eleanor sat at her kitchen table and ate the second tomato like an apple, the juice running down her chin. The flavour exploded in her mouth – a complex chord of sweetness and acidity, a taste of sunshine and effort and rich, dark earth. It was utterly, astonishingly real. It was the antithesis of the insipid, predictable flavours of her old life: the bland salmon, the watery Chardonnay, the glossy but tasteless fruit in the hospitality bowls at client meetings. This was not a commodity. This was a result. As she ate, she looked at the silver-framed photograph of her and Gregory that she had brought down from her bedroom. She had been meaning to put it away, but had not yet decided on the correct procedure for archiving a failed investment. She picked it up and looked at the smiling, handsome man who had called her broken. He had a life of glossy, marketable flavour. He would never understand the profound satisfaction of this tomato. With a quiet finality, she unlatched the back of the frame, slid the photograph out, and dropped it into the kitchen bin.

The time had come to close the last of her old accounts. Her position at Abernathy & Codd was a lingering, unresolved liability. The thought of returning to the office, to the third floor, to the window, was a cold weight in her stomach. But to simply post a letter of resignation felt incomplete, a piece of unfinished business. She had spent ten years of her life filing the past away in its correct place; she could not leave her own past in a state of administrative disarray. She needed to retrieve her personal effects, to say her goodbyes, to draw a definitive line under that column of her life. She would go on a Friday, when the office quieted down early for the weekend. The decision, once made, settled in her with a calm resolve. This was not a challenge being forced upon her; it was a task she was setting for herself. A final audit.

On the Friday morning, she did not dress in her old corporate armour of navy dress and sensible court shoes. She chose a pair of comfortable linen trousers, a simple cotton shirt, and the flat walking shoes that had carried her to Dyer’s Emporium and back. She did not feel like an accountant preparing for a meeting; she felt like herself. The bus journey into town was different this time. She sat on the seaward side, and while she did not stare out at the panoramic view, she allowed her gaze to rest on it. The bay was a sheet of dazzling, indifferent blue. The boats were tracing their white lines upon it. It was a fact of geography, no more or less threatening than the red soil of the cliffs or the heavy clay in the bottom of her own garden. When she arrived at the mock-Georgian building, she did not hesitate. She walked through the heavy glass doors and, ignoring the lift, she took the stairs. One flight. Two flights. Three flights. Her breath was even, her legs were strong from her work in the garden. She arrived on the third floor not as a terrified creature, but simply as a person who had chosen to take the stairs.

The office was hushed, the air tasting of paper and recycled air. A few of her former colleagues looked up in surprise as she entered. Her desk, the one she had moved to face the wall, was now occupied by a keen-faced young man she vaguely recognised from the graduate intake. Her belongings had been packed into a single, neat cardboard box that sat on the corner of the reception desk. Mr. Abernathy emerged from his office, his face a mask of polite concern. “Eleanor. We weren’t expecting you. Are you… fully recovered?” He looked her up and down, a flicker of confusion in his eyes. He was taking in her casual clothes, the healthy colour in her cheeks, the faint line of soil she could never quite scrub from under her fingernails. She looked, she realised, like a stranger. "I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Abernathy," she said, her voice clear and steady. "I've come to collect my things, and to give you this." She handed him a crisp white envelope containing her formal resignation.

He took it, his expression unreadable. "I see. Well, we are, of course, sorry to lose you, Eleanor. Your work has always been exemplary." He gestured vaguely at the box. "Let me know if anything is missing." It was a dismissal, polite and final. The account was all but closed. But there was one last item to check. She turned away from him and, on an impulse she hadn't planned, she walked towards her old desk, the one by the window. The young man looked up at her, startled. "Excuse me," she said softly, and she stood in the space that had once been hers. She looked out of the window. The view was just as it had always been: the harbour, the clinking masts, the gulls circling on the breeze. She looked down. The drop to the street was still precipitous. She felt a tremor, the faint, physiological echo of past terror, a ghost in her nervous system. But it was only that, an echo. It had no power. Her mind did not supply the falling sensation. It supplied the memory of standing on the third step of her ladder, looking down at the crack in her own patio. Her foundations were elsewhere now. She was no longer a creature of paper and ink, balanced precariously three floors above the ground. She was a woman who knew the weight of a ripe tomato, the texture of the earth, and the quiet satisfaction of a well-staked plant. The view was just a view. She turned away from the window, a small, private smile on her lips. She had just performed her final, most difficult audit, and had found the books, at last, to be in perfect balance. She picked up her box, gave Mr. Abernathy a polite nod, and walked out of the office for the last time, not into a terrifying void, but into the bright, warm afternoon of the rest of her life.Autumn came not as a gentle fading but as a swift, brutal auditor. A single night of sharp, clear frost in late September was all it took. Eleanor woke to a world rimed in white and found her tomato plant, which had been the central column of her summer’s ledger, utterly ruined. The leaves were blackened and limp, the remaining fruit softened and spoiled. The strong green vine had become a dark, decaying rope. She stood before it, a cold hollowness in her chest that was horribly familiar. The assets had been liquidated overnight, without warning. Her meticulously kept notebook, with its record of growth and profit, suddenly seemed like a document of a defunct enterprise. The rest of the garden was following suit. The vibrant greens were souring to yellow and brown, the rose bushes were skeletal claws, and a thick, damp carpet of fallen leaves covered the lawn, hiding the neat stripes Silas had so carefully mown. The world was shrinking again, dying back, and a cold tendril of the old panic began to curl in her stomach.

She fought it with a new kind of discipline. She refused to retreat to the sofa, refused to see the decay as a deficit. This was, she told herself, simply a different kind of accounting. It was the season of writing-off, of clearing the books for the next financial year. She began the hard, physical work of dismantling the summer. With a heavy heart, she cut down the tomato vine, pulling the dead weight from its bamboo stake and adding it to the compost bin – a final, sad deposit. She raked the leaves into huge, rustling piles. She pruned the roses back to gnarled stumps. The work was cold and damp, and it made her muscles ache, but each cleared bed, each neatly tied-back shrub, was a small act of defiance against the encroaching chaos. Her greatest act of faith was planting bulbs. On her hands and knees in the cold, damp soil, she buried dozens of narcissus and tulip bulbs, small, onion-like promises of a spring she had to believe would arrive. She was making an investment, sinking capital into the cold ground on the promise of a future dividend she could not see.

On one of his last visits of the season, Silas found her in the vegetable patch, forking over the heavy soil where the runner beans had grown, her face smudged with dirt and grim with effort. The air was cold, and her breath plumed in front of her. He watched her for a moment, his own work of leaf-clearing and final mowing complete. His visits would become less frequent now, ceasing altogether over the deep winter months. The thought of his absence was another liability she had not yet dared to enter into her books. He walked over, carrying not a tool, but a battered metal flask and two mugs. He didn't speak, but simply handed one to her. The gesture was so unexpected, so far outside the bounds of their established, silent contract, that she could only stare at it for a second before taking it. He unscrewed the cap of the flask and poured a stream of steaming, fragrant tea into her mug, then his own.

“Soil’s heavy here,” he said, looking at the clods of earth she had turned over. It was an observation, not a criticism. “Good for holding water in the summer. Hard work in the autumn.” He took a sip of his tea, his gaze moving over the bare beds, the skeletal fruit bushes, the general sense of dormancy. He seemed to see her anxiety, the way she surveyed the stripped-down garden as if it were a catastrophic loss. “Looks bare, doesn’t it?” he said, his voice a low rumble. “People think it’s all over now. But it isn’t. Everything that matters is happening where you can’t see it. The roots are settling. The bulbs are waiting. The worms are doing their work. It’s not dead, miss. It’s just balancing its books.”

The phrase, coming from him, was so startlingly perfect that Eleanor looked up from her mug and met his eyes directly. He looked back, his gaze steady, and she realised with a jolt that he had understood her from the very beginning. He had seen the accountant in the garden, the woman trying to impose order on the beautiful chaos of the world, and had not found it strange. He had simply given her the right tools and the right language to succeed. He reached into the large pocket of his coat and pulled out a small, thick stack of worn, brightly-coloured pamphlets, held together with a thick elastic band. They were seed catalogues. “Your winter work,” he said, placing them on top of a low wall. “Time to start planning for next year. Decide what you want. Draw it up. The paper’s patient.” He was giving her a new ledger, one for a business that had not yet begun trading. He was giving her the future, bound in an elastic band.

He drained his mug and took hers from her unresisting hand. He packed them away, the quiet ritual complete. As he turned to leave, he paused. “I’ve an allotment, over by the old quarry,” he said, not quite looking at her. “It’s different from a garden. More honest, somehow. I’m lifting the last of the leeks this weekend. You should come and see it. If you’ve a mind to.” It wasn’t a question expecting an answer. It was an offering, a map to a new territory laid gently at her feet. He nodded, a final gesture of acknowledgement, and walked away towards the gate, leaving Eleanor standing in the middle of her quiet, sleeping garden, holding a future full of paper promises, with the scent of hot, sweet tea still warming the cold air.The seed catalogues were her winter garden. In the evenings, when the wind rattled the window frames and the rain lashed against the glass, Eleanor would sit at her kitchen table, a mug of tea steaming at her elbow, and turn their glossy pages. It was a world of pure, unadulterated potential. Zinnias blazed in impossible shades of magenta and orange, cabbages sat like great green jewels on the page, and descriptions of tomatoes promised ‘vigorous growth’ and ‘superb flavour’. It was a ledger of pure assets, with no blight, no frost, no aphids listed under the liabilities. She took a fresh notebook, the twin of her summer ledger, and began to draw. With a ruler and a newly sharpened pencil, she mapped out her own small plot to scale. She drew neat rectangles for the vegetable beds, circles for imagined sunflowers, and wavy lines for the herbaceous border. She was not just planning a garden; she was drafting the constitution for a new world, a world she would build herself when the ground was ready. Silas’s invitation sat in the middle of all this paper-based hope like a solid, unmovable fact. An allotment. A place ‘more honest’ than a garden. The thought of it was both intimidating and magnetic. It was an invitation to a different kind of reality, one without the soft buffer of a lawn or the pretty disguise of a climbing rose.

The following Saturday, she stood before her wardrobe, the old question of what to wear taking on a new significance. Her neat dresses and sensible work skirts seemed like costumes from another life. She chose her oldest pair of trousers, a thick woollen jumper, and a waterproof jacket that had lain dormant for years. Her final, most crucial choice was her footwear: a pair of sturdy, rubber-soled walking boots she had bought for a long-abandoned hiking holiday with Gregory. Lacing them up felt like a deliberate, practical commitment. She caught her reflection in the hall mirror before she left. Her face was bare, her hair was tied back simply, and she looked less like a chartered accountant than ever before. She looked like a woman who was prepared for mud. The bus took her beyond the familiar territory of the town centre, climbing a long hill towards the semi-rural fringe of Torquay. The neat villas gave way to smaller, more rugged houses, and the pavements frayed at the edges. She got off at a stop marked only by a windswept shelter and a signpost pointing down a narrow lane: ‘Allotments’. The lane was unpaved, her boots crunching on loose gravel. To her right, the land rose sharply, a tangle of gorse and bramble. To her left, it fell away, and through a gap in a line of skeletal trees, she caught her first, gut-wrenching glimpse of what lay beyond: a vast, breathtaking emptiness. The quarry. She stopped, her hand flying to her throat as a wave of vertigo washed over her. It was a chasm, a colossal bite taken out of the world, its grey rock walls plunging hundreds of feet to a dark, unreadable floor. She tore her eyes away, her heart hammering, and fixed her gaze on the muddy track at her feet. Left foot, right foot. The mantra was a lifeline. She was not here for the view. She was here for the honest ground.

The allotments were sectioned off by a tall wire fence with a weather-beaten wooden gate. Pushing it open, she entered a different country. It was a patchwork quilt of human effort, laid out in neat, muddy squares under the vast grey sky. There were no rolling lawns or artful flowerbeds here. This was a place of straight lines, of bare earth turned over in dark, rich clods, of skeletal beanpole structures waiting for spring, and of sheds cobbled together from corrugated iron and old doors. The air smelled of woodsmoke from a distant bonfire, of damp soil, and of the sharp, metallic scent of winter greens. A few figures were dotted about, stooped over their work, their movements slow and purposeful. Eleanor spotted Silas at the far end, his back to her, rhythmically driving a fork into a patch of dark earth. He wore the same stoic, tireless posture as he did in her own garden, but here, in his own kingdom, he seemed larger, more elemental, a part of the landscape itself. She walked towards him, her boots sinking into the soft, grassy path, feeling like an intruder. He must have sensed her approach, for he stopped, plunged the fork into the ground, and turned. He didn't smile, but the lines around his eyes crinkled in acknowledgement. “You found it, then,” he said.

He led her not to a bench or a shed, but directly to his work. “Leeks,” he stated, gesturing to a dense row of what looked like stout, overgrown spring onions. “Last of them. They don’t mind the cold. Sweetens them, the frost does.” He worked the fork into the soil beside the row, leaned back on the handle, and the earth gave way with a soft, satisfying sigh, exposing the pale, white shafts of the leeks and their tangle of fine, thread-like roots. He pulled one free, shook the loose soil from it, and laid it on the ground. It was a simple act, but Eleanor watched, mesmerised. This was not like picking a tomato. This was an excavation, a retrieval of treasure from the deep, cold vault of the earth. He showed her his plot. It was a masterclass in pragmatism. Three large compost bins, made from old pallets, stood in a row. “The engine room,” he called them. A series of interconnected water butts collected every drop of rain from the shed roof. He pointed out the empty beds. “That one’s had potatoes for two years. It’s resting now. Put a green manure in come February. This one’s for the brassicas next year. They’ll follow the beans.” Eleanor listened, the accountant in her mind stirring with a new kind of excitement. This was a system. A four-year rotational ledger, designed to manage assets and prevent the depletion of capital. It was complex, logical, and beautiful in its efficiency. She saw not just bare earth, but a balance sheet of nutrients, a long-term investment strategy for the soil.

“It’s not like a garden,” she said, thinking aloud. “In a garden, you try to make everything look good all the time.” He paused, leaning on his fork, and considered this. “A garden’s for show,” he said, after a moment. “An allotment… it’s a conversation. With the seasons. You can’t tell the soil what to do. You have to listen to it. Work with what it gives you.” He gestured with his chin towards a pile of freshly dug leeks, their dark green tops and muddy roots forming a stark pattern against the earth. “Take these. They’ll do for your Sunday lunch.” He began to gather a generous armful, not waiting for her to accept or refuse. The transaction was a given. While he tied them with a piece of twine, Eleanor found her gaze being pulled, as if by a magnetic force, towards the edge of the allotment site, towards the wire fence that marked the boundary between this managed, human landscape and the great, silent void beside it. The quarry. She knew she had to look. To leave without facing it would be a failure, an entry left unbalanced. She walked slowly, her feet seeming to belong to someone else, towards the fence line. Silas, finished with the leeks, watched her go, but said nothing. He simply stood, a solid, grounding presence a dozen yards behind her.

She stopped a few feet from the fence, her hands gripping the cold, damp wood of a fence post. She took a breath, then another, and then she lifted her head and made herself look. It was immense. A silent, grey amphitheatre of stone, carved out by a century of dynamite and hard labour. Far, far below, pools of dark, stagnant water reflected the pale sky like dead eyes. The sheer, vertical drop was absolute. The primal terror, the memory of falling, rose in her throat, a familiar, choking bile. Her fingers, slick with a sudden sweat, tightened on the post. Her body wanted to recoil, to run, to scramble back to the safety of the muddy paths and neat vegetable beds. But this time, something held her in place. It was the memory of Silas’s voice. *It’s a conversation.* She forced herself to breathe, to look not at the terrifying emptiness, but at the thing itself. The rock walls were not a uniform grey. They were streaked with rust-red and ochre, patterned with patches of hardy green moss. They told a story of geology, of millennia of compressed time. And it was not a natural void. It was man-made. This was the debit that had built the town’s credits. The stone for the harbour wall that held back the chaotic sea had come from here. The foundations for the grand Victorian hotels, perhaps even The Imperial itself, had been quarried from this very spot. It was not a malevolent entity that wanted to pull her in. It was a vast, empty account, its balance transferred elsewhere. The logic of it, the sheer, undeniable double-entry bookkeeping of it on a geological scale, was a more powerful anchor than any railing.

She looked down into the chasm, and the world did not tilt. Her heart still beat fast, a frantic drum against her ribs, but the roaring in her ears had subsided. She was Eleanor Vance, a woman standing on a patch of solid ground, looking at a hole. It was a fact. A very large, very deep fact, but a fact nonetheless. She had observed it, identified it, and filed it. She had placed it in the correct column of the world’s ledger. She let go of the post, her hands leaving damp prints on the wood. When she turned, Silas was still there, watching her, his expression unreadable. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod, as if she had just passed a difficult but necessary examination. He held out the bundle of leeks, their earthy scent filling the cold air. “Best get these home,” he said. She took them, their weight a solid, reassuring burden in her arms. As she walked back down the lane, away from the allotments and the silent quarry, she did not look back. She kept her eyes on the path ahead, her boots making a steady, rhythmic crunch on the gravel, her mind already turning to the bright, patient pages of the seed catalogues, and the long, quiet, paper-based work of planning for the spring.The leeks, scrubbed clean of their allotment soil, made a magnificent soup, creamy and warming, that tasted of the cold, clean earth. For Eleanor, eating it felt like an act of communion, a way of internalising the lesson of that harsh, honest ground. Winter settled in not as an enemy, but as a season for the specific, quiet work she had been assigned. The seed catalogues became her sacred texts. She spread them across her kitchen table, a vibrant, glossy archipelago of promise on the dark wood, and her methodical mind, once trained on the intricacies of tax law, now applied itself to a new and far more compelling code. She drew up charts, cross-referencing planting times with harvesting schedules. She read about companion planting, learning that marigolds could deter nematodes from tomatoes, and that basil, planted nearby, was said to improve their flavour. It was a complex, interwoven system, a ledger where every entry affected every other, and she found a deep, absorbing pleasure in its logic.

Her greatest creation of that winter was the master plan. On a large sheet of graph paper, she drew her garden to scale, a god’s-eye view of the coming year. Each square on the paper represented a square foot of soil. She shaded in the area for early potatoes, marked the rows for carrots and parsnips with dotted lines, and drew a triumphant sunburst symbol where she planned to plant a small patch of sunflowers. She designed a four-year rotation for the main vegetable beds, a long-term strategy to ensure the continued solvency of the soil. The finished plan was a thing of beauty, a symphony of straight lines and precise calculations, a declaration of intent against the chaos of the coming seasons. It was the most important document she had ever produced. It was her future, rendered in pencil.

The outside world, however, had not entirely forgotten her. One cold morning in early December, a letter arrived that was not a seed catalogue. It was a crisp, impersonal statement from her bank. Her regular salary from Abernathy & Codd had, of course, ceased, and she had been living on her savings, a finite resource she had tried not to think about too closely. But here it was, laid out in stark, unforgiving columns of black ink. The numbers were no longer her compliant servants; they were a council of grim-faced judges. The debitscolumn was a catalogue of her daily existence—gas, electricity, council tax, groceries. The credit column was a blank, accusing wasteland, save for a piddling interest payment. At the bottom, the final balance, the sum of her worldly security, was significantly, terrifyingly, lower than she had imagined. The old fear returned, but it was a different vintage. It was not the dizzying fear of heights, but the cold, grinding fear of the bottom line. It was the fear of insolvency, a terror every bit as profound to an accountant as a fall from a cliff. For a whole day, the master plan on the graph paper looked like a frivolous fantasy, and the colourful seed catalogues seemed to be mocking her with their impossible abundance.

The anxiety gnawed at her for the rest of the week, a cold stone in her stomach. The meticulous joy of her planning evaporated, replaced by a frantic, internal audit of every small expenditure. Her quiet fortress once again began to feel like a trap, its comfort a luxury she could no longer afford. She needed to see the honest ground again. The following Saturday, wrapped in her warmest coat, she made the pilgrimage back to the allotment. The landscape was even more stark now, the ground hard with frost, the skeletal trees etched black against a low, white sky. The place was almost deserted, but Silas was there, his stooped figure a landmark in the quiet devastation of winter. He was repairing the door of his shed, his breath misting in the air as he worked a screwdriver with slow, deliberate turns. He saw her approach and paused, his gaze taking in the tight set of her jaw, the worry that she wore like a thin coat.

He did not ask what was wrong. He simply straightened up and gestured with his head towards the shed. “Come and see something.” He led her inside. The shed was a tiny, organised world, smelling of dry wood, earth, and old metal. Tools hung in their proper places, and bundles of dried herbs were suspended from the rafters. On a makeshift shelf stood a row of old jam jars, each one filled with small, mysterious shapes and bearing a carefully handwritten label. ‘Runner Bean, Czar.’ ‘Cosmos, Purity.’ ‘Poppy, Ladybird.’ “My retained earnings,” he said, his voice softer in the confined space. “You can’t buy better. These ones know the soil here. They’re acclimatised.” He picked up a small, brown paper envelope, folded at the corners, and shook a few seeds into his palm. They were tiny, black, and tear-drop shaped. “Onion,” he said. “Ailsa Craig. Good keepers.” He tipped them into a fresh envelope, folded it with practiced fingers, and wrote the name on it in pencil. He handed it to her. “You start them off inside, next month. On a windowsill.”

Eleanor took the small packet. It felt weightless in her hand, yet it contained a potential harvest. It was an asset of a different kind, one that did not appear on any bank statement. It was a gift of faith. The knot of financial anxiety in her chest seemed to loosen its grip, replaced by the simple, practical reality of this task. Start the onions inside. On a windowsill. “Thank you,” she whispered, the words feeling inadequate. He just nodded, and went back to his work on the door, the audience concluded. She walked home with the packet of seeds clutched in her pocket, the hard little kernels a tangible promise. The bank statement was still a fact, but it was no longer the only fact. The fear had not vanished, but it had been moved into its proper column. It was a liability to be managed, not a judgment to be bowed to.

That evening, she sat down at her kitchen table with two ledgers. One was her bank statement. The other was her new garden notebook. With a ruler, she drew a fresh set of columns in the notebook. At the top, she wrote, ‘Garden Account’. From her savings account, she made a bold, decisive transfer. It was not a huge sum, but it was a formal allocation of capital. She entered it into her garden ledger as ‘Initial Investment.’ Beneath it, she began to list her planned expenditures: ‘Seed Potatoes,’ ‘Compost,’ ‘Lime.’ Then, she took the small paper packet Silas had given her, and on a new line in the Assets column, she wrote: ‘Onion Seed (Ailsa Craig).’ She looked at the two words, her own handwriting on the clean page. She could not assign a monetary value to them, yet she knew with an unshakeable certainty that it was the most valuable entry in the entire book. Outside, the winter garden was dark and silent, but inside, on the kitchen windowsill, the first green shoots of the paper-white narcissus bulbs she had planted months ago were beginning to push their way into the light.The onion seeds were her first act of the new year. In the quiet lull of late January, when the world outside was a watercolour wash of grey and brown, Eleanor turned her kitchen into a makeshift potting shed. Following instructions from a book propped open against a bag of seed compost, she filled shallow trays with the dark, fine-textured soil, levelling it with the edge of a ruler. It was an act of familiar precision, but the medium was new. This soil was not sterile data; it was a substance brimming with dormant life. She opened the small paper envelope Silas had given her, the words ‘Ailsa Craig’ written in his strong, practical pencil script, and tipped the tiny black seeds into her palm. They were impossibly small, each one a tightly folded-up future. With the tip of a pencil, she spaced them carefully across the surface of the compost, her movements slow and reverent. This was not like entering figures into a spreadsheet; this was like posting a thousand tiny, hopeful prayers.

For two weeks, the trays sat on the warm sill of the south-facing kitchen window, a grid of dark, patient earth. Eleanor checked them each morning with a nervous, obsessive hope. Then, one Tuesday, she saw it: a single, impossibly fine loop of brilliant green, pushing its way through the surface. The next day there were three more. Within a week, the trays were covered in a delicate, hazy forest of green threads, each one unbending itself towards the light. She felt a joy so fierce and pure it was almost painful. She had made this happen. She had presided over the miracle of germination. The paper-white narcissus on the other windowsill were now tall and elegant, their trumpet-like flowers scenting the entire room with a sweet, peppery fragrance. Her small ground-floor kingdom was no longer just a fortress against the outside world; it was a nursery, a laboratory, a place of vibrant, emergent life.

As February bled into a damp, blustery March, the world outside began to follow the lead of her windowsill. The iron-hard ground softened, the days lengthened, and the first shock troops of spring began to appear in the garden. The fat, purple-green spears of the tulip bulbs she had planted pushed through the soil, and the daffodils formed dense clumps of blade-like leaves, each one guarding a swollen, promising bud. The garden was waking up, and it was time for her to begin the heavy work. She consulted the master plan, her large, neatly drawn chart which was now pinned to a corkboard on the kitchen wall. Item one on the spring agenda: prepare the potato bed. She had already bought the seed potatoes – a variety called ‘Rocket’ – and had been ‘chitting’ them for weeks in egg boxes, watching with satisfaction as sturdy, purple-green sprouts emerged from their eyes. The time for planting was approaching, and the ground was not yet ready.

The designated patch was a rectangle of tired lawn she had never done anything with. Turning it over was brutal, physical work. She drove the tines of her garden fork into the matted turf, put her full weight on it, and heaved. The first section came up with a great, groaning tear of roots, trailing a network of pale threads from a thick slab of heavy, clay-like soil. For three days, she worked until her back screamed and her hands, even through gloves, were raw and blistered. She was no longer just an observer or a gentle pruner; she was a labourer, locked in a primal struggle with the earth itself. She sweated, she swore, she ached in muscles she hadn't known she possessed. But with every patch of grass she peeled back, with every forkful of dense, wet soil she turned and broke apart, she felt a profound, almost savage satisfaction. She was not just clearing a patch of ground. She was taking possession of it. When it was finally done, the neat rectangle of dark, broken earth looked like a wound in the green lawn, but to Eleanor, it was the most beautiful sight in the world. It was a blank page, ready for its first entry.

The cost of this new life, however, was being tallied in a different kind of ledger. Another bank statement arrived mid-month, and this time, the grim reality of the numbers could not be ignored. Her savings, her buffer against the world, were dwindling at an alarming rate. The 'Initial Investment' she had so boldly allocated to her ‘Garden Account’ now looked like a reckless folly. The price of seed potatoes, of compost, of the new, sturdy fork she had bought, all added up. A cold panic began to seep into the edges of her hard-won peace. This beautiful, absorbing world of growth and soil was a luxury, a hobby funded by a rapidly depleting resource. The master plan on the wall suddenly seemed like a child’s fantasy, a dream she would be forced to wake from. The fear of failure was back, not as a dizzying vertigo, but as the cold, hard logic of a balance sheet that refused to balance.

Distraught, she took herself to the allotment. It was a Saturday, and the place hummed with a new energy. The quiet stoicism of winter had been replaced by a bustling, purposeful industry. People were everywhere, wheeling barrows, turning soil, marking out lines with string. The air was full of voices, snatches of conversation carried on the brisk March wind. As she walked the muddy paths, she found herself listening. A man was complaining loudly that his parsnips had failed to germinate for the second year running. Two women were having a friendly argument about whether it was too early to plant out their beans. She saw another man standing forlornly before a bed where a neat row of seedlings had been entirely devoured by slugs. She saw wasted space, haphazard planting, and a general air of well-intentioned but inefficient chaos. And then she saw a woman, a newcomer by the look of her clean wellingtons, standing with a handful of seed packets, looking at her empty, un-dug plot with an expression of complete and utter bewilderment. The woman had the passion, the resources, the desire. But she had no plan.

It was in that moment that the two halves of Eleanor Vance—the meticulous, logical accountant and the earth-stained, passionate gardener—finally, perfectly, fused. The problem was not a lack of effort. It was a lack of system. These people needed more than just trowels and seeds; they needed a strategy. They needed crop rotation plans to keep their soil healthy. They needed planting calendars tailored to their specific plots. They needed advice on pest control, on soil management, on maximising yield from a small space. They needed, she realised with a jolt that was part joy and part terror, an accountant for their gardens. A consultant. She could help them create their own master plans. She could audit their soil, assess their assets, and create a sustainable, long-term strategy for growth. The idea was so radical, so completely her own, that it left her breathless. It was not a retreat from the world of ledgers and balance sheets; it was a bold new application of its fundamental principles.

She found Silas by his cold frame, carefully transplanting tiny lettuce seedlings into pots. She stood for a moment, gathering her courage, her mind racing. She didn't have the words for a business pitch, not yet. She could only approach it from the problem she had identified. “People don’t seem to know where to start,” she said, her voice a little shaky. “They have all the seeds, but they put things in the wrong place, at the wrong time. They don't seem to have a… a system.” Silas did not look up from his delicate work, but a faint grunt acknowledged he was listening. “They waste a lot,” Eleanor continued, gaining confidence. “They exhaust the soil in one spot and leave another empty. If they just had a plan, a proper rotation… they could get so much more out of it.” He finished potting the last seedling, setting it gently in the tray with the others. Only then did he straighten up and look at her. He wiped his earthy hands on his trousers, his gaze steady and considering. “Most folk are either thinkers or doers,” he said slowly. “The doers get their hands dirty but they make a mess of it. The thinkers draw pretty pictures but they’re scared of the mud. It’s rare to find someone who’s both.” He glanced over at his own immaculately ordered plot, a testament to decades of thought and action. Then his eyes came back to her face. “You’ve got your potato bed dug, I expect?” he asked. “Yes,” she said. “Last week.” He gave a single, slow nod. It was a gesture of profound approval. It contained everything she needed to hear. He saw that she was both. He was not just validating her work in the garden; he was validating her. Eleanor walked away from the allotment that day not with a bundle of leeks, but with something far more precious. She had a vocation. Her own small, muddy, perfectly logical place in the world.The walk home from the allotment was a journey through a transformed landscape. The streets were the same, the houses stood in their familiar places, but Eleanor was moving through them with a new purpose. The cold fear of the bank statement hadn't vanished, but it had been re-categorised. It was no longer a verdict; it was a motivating factor, the stark ‘reason why’ that galvanised all successful enterprises. Her mind, a precision instrument trained for order and strategy, was alight with the possibilities of her revelation. For the first time since leaving Abernathy & Codd, she wasn’t just reacting to the world, she was about to act upon it.

That evening, she did not open the seed catalogues. She took out a fresh, crisp notebook, drew a margin with a ruler, and wrote a title at the top of the page: ‘Business Plan: VANCE GARDEN STRATEGY’. The name came to her fully formed, solid and professional. For the next two hours, she worked with a focused intensity that made her forget the lateness of the hour, the chill in the air, everything but the beautiful, emerging logic of the system she was creating. She outlined her services, the language a perfect hybrid of her two selves. There would be an ‘Initial Site Audit’, including soil pH testing and aspect analysis. This would be followed by a ‘Bespoke Cultivation Strategy’, a comprehensive document including a scaled site-plan, a four-year crop rotation schedule to manage ‘soil assets’, and a detailed planting and harvesting calendar. She even drafted a section on ‘Liability Management’, covering common pests and diseases. It was thorough, it was logical, and it was a service she knew, with a sudden, bone-deep certainty, that people needed.

Her target market was right there, at the allotments: a captive community of enthusiasts, many of whom were rich in ambition but poor in method. But how to reach them? She couldn't simply walk up to people and critique their haphazard planting. She needed to present herself professionally. She spent the next evening at her computer, not aimlessly surfing, but designing a small, discreet notice on a simple word-processing program. She chose a classic, clear font – Garamond, the font of respectable books. The text was concise and to the point:

**VANCE GARDEN STRATEGY**

Offering bespoke planning services for allotment holders, including:
- Site Audits & Soil Analysis
- 4-Year Crop Rotation Plans
- Bespoke Planting & Harvesting Calendars

For an initial, no-obligation consultation, please contact E. Vance.

She printed a dozen copies on good quality, cream-coloured cardstock. They looked professional, serious. But as she stacked them into a neat pile, a familiar caution asserted itself. The accountant in her knew that you could not launch a product without a proof of concept. She needed a case study, a successful pilot project that would validate her methods and, more importantly, her nerve. Her mind went immediately to the woman she had seen on her last visit, the newcomer with the clean boots and the expression of profound bewilderment as she stared at her un-dug plot. That was her client.

The next Saturday was grey and blustery, threatening rain. Eleanor wrapped the stack of cards in a waterproof plastic sleeve and set off for the allotment, her heart a nervous drum against her ribs. She found the woman exactly where she had been before, standing at the edge of her plot as if on the shore of a vast, muddy ocean she had no idea how to cross. She was prodding tentatively at a clump of couch grass with the toe of her boot. Eleanor took a deep breath, a debit of courage, and walked towards her. "Excuse me," she began, her voice a little unsteady. The woman looked up, her expression a mixture of relief and embarrassment. "I'm sorry, am I in the way?" "Not at all," Eleanor said. "I just... I saw you last week. It's a bit overwhelming, isn't it? When you first start." The woman gave a short, rueful laugh. "Overwhelming is the word. I'm Sarah. My husband got me this plot for my birthday. I think he vastly overestimated my abilities. I don't know where to begin."

This was the opening. Eleanor’s hands felt slick inside her gloves. “It’s mostly just a matter of having a plan,” she said, the words coming out more confidently than she expected. “I’m a… well, I’m developing a sort of planning service for allotment holders. A system, really. And I was wondering if you might be interested in being a pilot project. For free, of course. It would help me test my methods, and it might help you get started.” Sarah stared at her, her eyes wide. "A plan? You mean, like, you'd tell me what to put where?" "And when," Eleanor confirmed. "And how to make sure the soil stays healthy for years to come. We'd start by talking about what you actually like to eat." Sarah’s face broke into a smile of pure, unadulterated relief. "Oh my god," she said. "Would you? That would be… that would be amazing."

The initial audit took place the following afternoon. Eleanor arrived with a clipboard, a tape measure, a compass, and a set of little labeled bags for soil samples. She felt a flicker of her old professional self, the competent Miss Vance arriving for a client meeting, but this felt infinitely more real. For an hour, she was in her element. She measured the plot precisely. She noted the shadows cast by a neighbouring row of raspberry canes. She took soil from three different locations. And she interviewed Sarah, her pencil flying across a pre-prepared questionnaire. "On a scale of one to five, how important are potatoes to your household?" "Do you have a preference for climbing beans or dwarf beans?" "Are you prepared to commit to the sequential sowing required for a consistent salad crop?" Sarah answered with enthusiastic gravity, entering into the spirit of it completely. To Eleanor, it was a diagnostic process. To Sarah, it was a conversation that was turning her vague, chaotic dream into a set of achievable goals.

For the next three evenings, Eleanor’s kitchen table was her office, her laboratory, and her design studio. She analysed the soil samples with a simple kit, finding it slightly acidic and low in nitrogen. She drew up the master plan on graph paper, a beautiful, logical map of Sarah’s future garden, incorporating a strict four-year rotation. She created the planting calendar, a detailed spreadsheet that broke the entire year down into weekly tasks. When it was finished, she collated it all into a simple, smart folder. It was the first tangible product of Vance Garden Strategy. It was perfect.

She presented it to Sarah at the allotment on a bright, cold Sunday morning. They sat on a makeshift bench by Sarah’s plot, and Eleanor talked her through the documents, explaining the logic of the crop rotation, the reasoning behind her choice of a lime-loving brassica bed. Sarah listened, her eyes moving from the neat charts to her own muddy patch of ground. She was not just seeing a plan; she was seeing the future. When Eleanor finished, Sarah was silent for a long moment, just turning the pages of the folder. "I can do this," she said softly, her voice full of wonder. "It all makes sense. I know what to do on Monday. And next week. And next month. You haven't just given me a map, Eleanor. You've taught me how to read it." The look of gratitude on Sarah’s face, the sheer, unburdened hope, was a dividend beyond any Eleanor had ever calculated. It was profit, pure and simple.

Buoyed by the success, Eleanor knew it was time. With Sarah’s enthusiastic endorsement echoing in her ears, she walked to the communal noticeboard by the main gate. It was a chaotic mess of curling, sun-faded flyers and handwritten notes tacked on top of each other. With a hand that was surprisingly steady, she took out one of her own cream-coloured cards and a single, sturdy thumbtack. She found a small, clear space, and pressed the card firmly into the weathered board. It stood out, a small rectangle of quiet order in the surrounding chaos. She did not linger. She simply performed the action, turned, and walked away, leaving her prospectus, her quiet declaration of a new professional existence, pinned up for the world to see. She had opened her business for trading. Now all she could do was wait for the market to respond.The week after the notice went up was a masterclass in controlled patience. Every time the phone rang – a cold call about insulation, a wrong number – Eleanor’s heart would leap into her throat before settling back into a state of tense disappointment. The silence from the allotment community was absolute. She began to doubt herself. The cream-coloured card, which had seemed so professional and understated in her kitchen, now felt, in her imagination, like a piece of wild arrogance, a presumptuous note pinned to the door of a private club. To keep the rising tide of anxiety at bay, she threw herself into the physical reality of her own master plan. It was time to plant the potatoes.

The task was grounding in its simplicity. She dug a series of straight, shallow trenches in the bed she had worked so hard to prepare. The dark, friable earth smelled clean and full of promise. One by one, she took the chitted seed potatoes from their egg boxes, their purple sprouts like small, determined fists reaching for the light, and placed them in the trench, exactly eighteen inches apart, just as her research had dictated. She was a foot-soldier following the orders of her own strategic command. As she worked, covering each potato with a careful blanket of soil, she focused on the rhythm of the action: dig, place, cover. It was a meditation. It did not matter if the phone never rang. It did not matter if Vance Garden Strategy was a company with only one, unpaid, successful project. This, here, was real. This bed of potatoes was an investment, a statement of faith in her own future, for her own benefit. She was building her own assets, independent of any market.

By the following Saturday, her resolve was beginning to fray. She walked to the allotment, telling herself she was just checking on Sarah’s progress, but her true mission was to look at the noticeboard. She saw it from twenty yards away. Her card was still there, a pale rectangle against the weathered wood, untouched. No one had even taken her number. A cold feeling of failure washed over her. Sarah’s plot, however, was a scene of transformation. The turf was gone, the soil was turned, and a neat grid of string lines marked out the first vegetable beds, exactly as specified in the plan. Sarah, her face flushed with effort and pride, was on her hands and knees, planting onion sets. “It’s amazing, Eleanor!” she called out, waving a muddy glove. “I know exactly what I’m doing! A few people have asked me who did my plan. I told them all about you.” Eleanor’s heart gave a hopeful flutter. “Have they?” “Oh, yes. Mostly the men just grunted, but I think they were secretly impressed.”

The grunt came in the form of a phone call on Monday evening. An elderly, gravelly voice on the other end of the line dispensed with all pleasantries. “Is this the garden person?” Eleanor’s pulse quickened. “This is E. Vance, yes.” “Right. Name’s Arthur. Got a plot down the allotment. Number 17. Saw your notice.” There was a long, challenging pause. “I’ve got a problem with my carrots.” Eleanor gripped the receiver. This was it. Her first real, unsolicited enquiry. “What kind of problem?” she asked, her voice calm and professional. “They fork,” the voice grumbled. “Every year. Go down an inch, then split into three. Useless. Tried everything. More sand. Less sand. Different variety. My father had this plot, and his father before him. Never had forked carrots. It’s a curse, is what it is.” “I see,” Eleanor said, her mind already shifting into diagnostic mode. “Would you be willing to have me take a look? I could perform a site audit. No obligation.” Another pause. She could almost hear him weighing his forty years of experience against his useless, forked carrots. “Tuesday,” he grunted. “Four o’clock. Don’t be late.” And the line went dead.

Arthur’s plot was the polar opposite of Sarah’s blank canvas. It was a place of ingrained habit, entrenched for decades. The paths were worn into deep grooves, the shed sagged with age, and a magnificent, gnarled old rhubarb plant occupied a prime piece of sunny ground with the immovable permanence of a monument. Arthur himself was small and wiry, with a face like a dried apple and eyes that were narrowed with deep, ingrained suspicion. He stood with his arms crossed as Eleanor, clipboard in hand, began her audit. He watched her every move as she tested the soil pH, measured the dimensions, and made notes on the aspect. “Been doing it this way for forty years,” he muttered, as if daring her to find fault. “It’s the curse, I tell you.” Eleanor did not argue. She simply proceeded with her system. When she got to the bed designated for root vegetables, she did not just take a surface sample. She took her trowel and dug down, a full six inches, then a foot. She sifted the soil through her fingers, her brow furrowed in concentration. Then she found it. The soil was good, a fine loam, but it was full of small, sharp stones, no bigger than a thumbnail, a subterranean gravel field just below the surface. “It’s not a curse, Arthur,” she said, holding out a palmful of the gritty soil. “It’s stones. A carrot is a taproot. When it’s growing down, it hits a stone, and the path of least resistance is to split and go around it. Your father probably dug this bed deeper than you do. Or maybe the winter frosts have just brought more stones to the surface over the years.”

Arthur stared at the stones in her hand, then at his bed. The simple, mechanical logic of her explanation was more powerful than any argument. It replaced a mysterious, unbeatable curse with a tangible, physical problem. “Stones,” he repeated, the word flat. “So what do I do? Pick ’em all out?” “For the carrot bed, yes,” Eleanor said calmly. “You’ll need to dig it over, two feet deep, and sieve the soil. It’s hard work. But if you do it once, properly, that bed will give you perfect carrots for years.” He was silent for a long time, contemplating the back-breaking labour of sieving an entire vegetable bed. He looked at Eleanor, at her clean, methodical notes, at the quiet confidence on her face. He had come expecting magic or nonsense, and she had given him logic and hard work. He gave a final, reluctant grunt. “How much do you charge for this… plan of yours?” he asked, the words tasting like a concession.

Eleanor walked home from the allotment that evening with a crisp, slightly worn ten-pound note in her pocket. Arthur had insisted on paying for the initial consultation. It felt heavier and more valuable than any paycheque she had ever received from Abernathy & Codd. It was not a salary. It was her first earned income. It was proof of concept. That evening, she took out a new, slim cashbook she had bought for the purpose. On the first page, she wrote the date. In the particulars column, she wrote, ‘A. Jennings (Plot 17) – Initial Audit’. And in the credit column, she wrote, with a hand that did not tremble in the slightest, ‘£10.00’. The account for Vance Garden Strategy was open, and it was in profit. It was a small, almost laughable sum in the face of her dwindling savings, but it was a start. It was a single, perfect carrot, straight and true, pulled from the stubborn earth.Arthur’s full strategic plan was a document of stark, uncompromising practicality. Eleanor delivered it to him on a brisk Tuesday afternoon, presenting the folder not with the fawning deference of a salesperson, but with the quiet authority of a doctor delivering a diagnosis and a course of treatment. The core of the plan was a section she had titled ‘Remediation of Root Vegetable Bed (Plot 17c)’. It detailed, in a series of bullet points, the process of digging the bed to a depth of two feet and sieving the entire volume of soil to remove all stones larger than a pea. She had even included a hand-drawn diagram of a simple, timber-framed sieve he could build himself. Arthur read it in silence, his lips moving slightly as he took in the scale of the task. He looked from the neat, typed instructions to the bed in question, a patch of ground that had defied him for years, and then back to Eleanor. She met his gaze without flinching.

“It’s a devil of a job,” he said at last, not as a complaint, but as a simple statement of fact. “Take me a month of Sundays.” He tapped the folder with a gnarled finger. “And you’re sure this’ll do it?” “The logic is sound,” Eleanor replied. “A clear path for the taproot will result in an un-forked vegetable. It’s a matter of engineering, not luck.” He stared at her for another long moment, this strange woman who spoke of carrots as if they were bridge supports. He seemed to be weighing forty years of habit against the brutal, undeniable logic of her plan. Finally, he gave a slow, deliberate nod. “Right then,” he grunted, handing her another, slightly less worn, ten-pound note. “Best get on with it.” He expected her to take the money and leave him to his fate, to the solitary, back-breaking labour she had prescribed. He did not expect her to turn up the following Saturday morning, dressed in her oldest clothes, carrying a garden sieve she had bought that morning from Dyer’s Emporium.

“I thought a pilot project deserved a degree of hands-on supervision,” she said, by way of explanation, before he could protest. She set down the sieve, picked up the spare fork that leaned against his shed, and drove it into the cursed earth of Plot 17c. Arthur stood, utterly nonplussed for a moment, then a slow, reluctant smile cracked the weathered landscape of his face. He picked up his own fork. For the next three hours, they worked in a strange, silent partnership. They fell into a rhythm. He would dig, heaving up the dense, stony soil with the practiced strength of a lifetime’s labour. She would break up the clods and shovel the earth into the sieve, which they had propped on two old vegetable crates. Then came the part that was a revelation to Eleanor: the shaking. The rhythmic, dusty, rattling action that separated the fine, dark soil from the hard, useless stones. The good earth rained through the mesh onto a tarpaulin on the ground, while the stones, a collection of flinty, grey disappointments, rattled and gathered in the sieve. It was the most perfect, most satisfying form of auditing she had ever performed, a physical separation of assets and liabilities.

They worked through the morning, speaking only in brief, practical grunts. “Tea?” he’d ask, and she would nod, and they would stop for five minutes to drink scalding, sweet tea from his battered flask. The pile of sieved, perfect soil grew into a dark, promising mountain. The bucket of stones filled up, then another. Other allotment holders, on their way to their own plots, would slow down as they passed, staring in disbelief at the sight of grumpy Arthur working in tandem with the mysterious ‘garden planner woman’. They saw her not just talking, but doing. They saw her muddy, sweating, and strong. The social currency of this single act was worth more than a thousand notices pinned to a board. The work was hard, but as she drove the shovel into the pile of unsorted earth, Eleanor felt a profound sense of rightness. This was what she did now. She did not just identify problems from a clean, safe distance; she got down into the dirt and helped to fix them.

By the time they stopped, the first quarter of the bed was done, a patch of stunningly fine, dark, stone-free tilth. It looked like cake. Arthur ran a hand through it, a look of wonder on his face. “Haven’t seen soil like that on this plot since I was a boy,” he murmured. He looked at Eleanor, at her mud-streaked face and blistered hands. The suspicion in his eyes was gone, replaced by a deep and grudging respect. “You earned your money today,” he said, which from Arthur was the equivalent of a poetic tribute. That evening, Eleanor’s phone rang three times. The first call was from a man named David, who had seen her working with Arthur. He had a problem with clubroot in his brassicas and had heard she “knew about systems”. The second was from a pair of young women who had just taken on a half-plot and wanted to grow cut flowers but were overwhelmed by the weeds. The third was from the allotment committee secretary, asking if she would be willing to give a short talk on crop rotation at their next meeting.

Her cashbook began to fill up. The initial trickle of income became a slow but steady stream. The tens and twenties, logged in her neat, precise hand, began to mount. It was not a fortune. It was not a replacement for the corporate salary she had once earned. But it was hers. Every pound was a direct result of her own knowledge, her own effort, her own courage. It was solvent. She realised with a sense of quiet amazement that her business was viable. Vance Garden Strategy was no longer a desperate hope; it was a functioning enterprise. Spring arrived in a riot of green. In her own garden, the potato leaves, dark and crinkly, pushed their way through the soil in neat, satisfying rows. The forest of onion seedlings on her windowsill grew thick and strong, ready to be planted out. Her world was expanding, not shrinking. It was no longer confined to her house, or her garden, or even the familiar paths of the allotment. It now encompassed Plot 17c and its future carrots, Sarah’s burgeoning grid of vegetables, David’s afflicted brassica patch, and a dozen other small, muddy kingdoms where she was now a trusted advisor, a bringer of logic and order.

One sunny afternoon in April, she was at the allotment, pacing out a new plot for a client, her tape measure flashing in the sun, when she saw Silas watching her from the far end of the path. He was not working, just standing, his hands in his pockets, observing. He saw her consult her notes, then explain a point to the eager-faced young man whose plot it was. He saw the man nod, a look of dawning comprehension on his face. He saw Eleanor smile, a confident, easy smile she would never have been capable of a year ago. As she finished her consultation and the new client walked away, energised and full of purpose, Silas ambled over. He stopped beside the bed she had been measuring, and scuffed at the soil with his boot. “Busy,” he said. It was not a question. It was a statement of fact, an observation of a successful harvest. “Yes,” Eleanor said, a thrill of pride running through her. “It seems people need a plan.” He looked at her, at the clipboard in her hand, at the smudge of honest dirt on her cheek. His gaze was steady, and contained within it the memory of a woman cowering on a hotel terrace, a woman hiding behind her own net curtains, a woman hesitating at the foot of a small stepladder. He saw the journey in its entirety. “Good,” he said. And the single, quiet word was more valuable than any ten-pound note. It was the final, definitive entry, the one that confirmed, beyond all doubt, that her books were, at last, in perfect balance.The high summer sun beat down on the allotments, baking the dusty paths and drawing up a rich, complex perfume of ripe tomatoes, peppery nasturtiums, and the deep, green scent of bean leaves. The quiet, solitary work of winter had given way to a bustling, communal harvest. The air, once filled only with the cry of gulls and the whisper of the wind, now carried the drone of conversations over runner bean trellises, the laughter of children stealing raspberries, and the rhythmic *thump-thump* of someone knocking soil from a freshly dug potato fork. Eleanor moved through this landscape not as a visitor, but as an integral part of its ecosystem. She was no longer just the ‘garden planner woman’; she was Eleanor, the person to ask about blackfly, the one who could tell you if your soil needed lime just by looking at the colour of your hydrangea. Her progress along the main path was a slow one, punctuated by greetings and questions. “Eleanor! Have a look at this squash!” “Morning, Eleanor, that spray you recommended for the mildew worked a treat.” “My spinach is bolting, what do you reckon?” She dispensed advice with a calm, practical authority, her solutions rooted not in lofty theory, but in the shared reality of this specific patch of earth.

Her pilot projects were now her most effective advertisements. Arthur, his initial grumpiness having thawed to a permanent state of grudging respect, would hold up a perfectly straight, magnificent carrot to any passer-by who slowed down. “See that?” he’d declare. “That’s systems, that is. No curse. Just bloody systems.” Sarah’s plot was a vision of ordered abundance, a testament to the master plan. Her neat, productive rows were a source of constant admiration, and she had become Eleanor’s most enthusiastic evangelist, pressing Vance Garden Strategy flyers into the hands of anyone who praised her beans. Eleanor’s business was thriving in a way she had never anticipated. It grew organically, through word of mouth, rooted in the tangible evidence of her success. Her cashbook showed a steady, reassuring income, enough to silence the cold voice of the bank statement and prove that this new life was not just a therapeutic hobby, but a sustainable enterprise. She had created a niche in the world that was perfectly, uniquely, her own.

The invitation arrived in mid-August, on thick, creamy cardstock that felt unnervingly familiar. It was from the Torquay Horticultural Society, announcing their annual awards ceremony to be held, of all places, in the grand ballroom of The Imperial Hotel. The allotment committee had, for the first time, been invited to participate. There were prizes for ‘Best Kept Plot’ and ‘Heaviest Marrow’. The letter informed Eleanor that her work had been noted, and she was being awarded a special commendation for ‘Outstanding Contribution to Community Horticulture’. The words swam before her eyes. The Imperial Hotel. The ballroom. The terrace. The scene of her utter, humiliating collapse. A ghostly tremor of the old vertigo went through her, a faint echo of the world tilting on its axis. But it was only an echo. Her first thought was not of the drop, but of the irony. A year ago, she had been dragged there as a decorative accessory to a man who sold glossy, empty houses. Now she was being invited back, in her own right, for her expertise in dirt and vegetables.

She did not have to go. She could write a polite note, plead a prior engagement. No one would think anything of it. But the thought of avoidance felt like leaving a single, untidy account open in an otherwise perfectly balanced ledger. It was a piece of unfinished business. To decline would be to admit that the place still held power over her. To go would be to conduct a final, personal audit of how far she had come. She looked from the invitation to her master plan, still pinned to the kitchen wall. Her gaze fell on the neatly drawn rectangle that represented her potato bed. She had started digging them up that week, and the yield was astonishing. Each plant gave up a cascade of clean, firm, perfectly formed tubers. An asset she had created from a patch of scruffy lawn. She smoothed the thick card of the invitation on the table. She would go. Not as Gregory’s fiancée, not as a chartered accountant, but as E. Vance of Vance Garden Strategy, a specialist in the cultivation of assets from the ground up.

She chose her outfit with care. It was not armour, but a quiet statement of her new identity. A simple, well-cut linen dress the colour of lavender, flat leather sandals, and no jewellery apart from a pair of small, silver earrings. Her hands were clean, but no amount of scrubbing could entirely remove the faint, dark line of honest soil from beneath her fingernails. She wore it like a badge of office. As she walked into the grand ballroom, the scene was both familiar and utterly alien. The same stifling heat, the same clink of glasses and hum of conversation. But this time, she was not clinging to anyone’s elbow. She knew people here. She saw Arthur, looking deeply uncomfortable in a tie, standing in a corner with a group of other allotment holders. She saw Sarah, who waved enthusiastically. She was not an outsider. She belonged. And then she saw him. Gregory was standing near the bar, schmoozing a local councillor, looking as handsome and as polished as ever. His eyes swept the room, professionally assessing the networking potential, and they fell on her. A flicker of confusion crossed his face. He saw her, but he didn’t seem to recognise her. He was looking for the timid woman in the navy dress. This person, standing alone, at ease, radiating a quiet confidence he had never seen, did not compute. He excused himself and walked towards her, a predatory smile forming on his lips.

“Eleanor,” he said, his voice a smooth blend of surprise and condescension. “Well, well. Fancy seeing you here. I heard you were… spending a lot of time outdoors.” He looked her up and down, his gaze lingering for a second on her soil-stained fingernails. “It seems to suit you. Very… rustic.” Eleanor felt nothing. No anger, no pain, not even a flicker of the old shame. She simply saw a man whose entire value system was based on surface and sheen. “Hello, Gregory,” she said, her voice calm and even. “Yes, I have a business now. Garden planning and strategy.” He laughed, a short, sharp bark. “A business? How lovely. A little hobby to keep you busy. Good for you.” His patronising tone, which would once have withered her, now seemed utterly absurd. He could no more understand the value of her work than he could the complex chemistry of photosynthesis. He was trying to file her away in a column marked ‘broken things’, but she no longer belonged on his balance sheet. “It’s more than a hobby,” she said, with a small, quiet smile. “It’s solvent.” The word, her word, hung in the air between them, and he had no response to it. She gave a polite nod, the kind one gives to a stranger on a train, and walked away, leaving him standing alone in the middle of the room, his perfect smile faltering as he watched her go.

Her name was called. She walked to the small stage, shook hands with the head of the Horticultural Society, and accepted a small, engraved silver trowel. The applause from the allotment contingent was loud and genuine. As she stepped down, instead of returning to her seat, she found herself walking, as if drawn by an invisible thread, towards the heavy French doors at the end of the ballroom. She pushed one open and stepped out onto the terrace. The change was instant. The drone of the ballroom faded, replaced by the cry of a distant gull. The sun was low in the sky, casting a golden, forgiving light over the world. She walked to the wrought-iron railing, her sensible sandals making a soft clicking on the tiles. She rested her hands on the cool iron. She looked out. The whole of Torbay arced before her, a perfect crescent of blue and gold. And she saw it not as a terrifying void, but as a map of her own making. She could see the dark green smudge of the hills where the quarry and the allotments lay. She could trace the line of the coast, noting the patches of deep, red soil exposed in the cliffs, soil like the heavy clay at the bottom of her own garden. She could see the town, not as a collection of precarious heights, but as a place of homes, of gardens, of other people living their lives on solid ground. She looked down. Directly down. At the jagged rocks where the sea foamed and churned. The world held steady. There was no lurch. There was no pull. There was only the rocks, and the sea, and the solid foundations of the hotel beneath her feet. She had looked into the abyss, and found it was just a view.

A few days later, she was in her own garden, kneeling on the earth she had once been too scared to look down upon. She was harvesting her potatoes, plunging her hands into the cool, dark soil and pulling up handful after handful of pale, beautiful tubers. It was a treasure hunt where she had buried the treasure herself. She heard the familiar click of the side gate and looked up. It was Silas, making an unscheduled visit. He carried no tools. He walked over and stood for a moment, looking at the bounty she had unearthed, the potatoes lying in pale piles on the rich soil. “Good yield,” he said. It was the highest of praise. “The soil is good,” she replied, echoing his own lesson back to him. “And the plan was sound.” He nodded, accepting the professional assessment. He reached into his pocket and brought out a single, perfect apple, so dark a red it was almost black. He had polished it on his sleeve. He handed it to her. She took it, its skin cool and smooth against her own earth-caked palm. “From the old tree on my plot,” he said. “First of the season.” It was a simple offering. A single dividend, from his accounts to hers. She took a bite. The flesh was crisp, sharp and breathtakingly sweet. They stood there for a long moment in the late afternoon sun, a comfortable silence between them, the quiet accountant and the silent gardener, surrounded by the evidence of their shared labours. Eleanor looked around at her small, ordered kingdom – at the sturdy potato plants, the last of the climbing beans, the bed where the winter greens would soon be planted. Her ledger was full. Every asset was accounted for, every liability managed. And in the final column, under a heading she had drawn in herself, she had finally, definitively, recorded an incalculable profit.Autumn came again, but this year it did not feel like a bankruptcy. It arrived not as a harbinger of decay and loss, but as the beginning of the financial year. The frantic energy of the summer harvest, with its rush of dividends in the form of beans and courgettes, gave way to the methodical, satisfying work of closing the books on a successful season and drafting the prospectus for the next. For Eleanor, and for Vance Garden Strategy, this was the busiest season of all. While the doers were putting their plots to bed, the thinkers were seeking her out, and her kitchen table was once again covered in the graph-paper dreams of other people’s gardens. The fear of insolvency was a distant memory, replaced by the pleasant, logistical challenge of scheduling consultations and managing her growing client list.

The talk at the allotment committee meeting was held on a Tuesday night in a drafty church hall that smelled of stewed tea and floor polish. A year ago, the thought of speaking in public would have been enough to trigger a panic attack. Tonight, as she stood before the thirty or so assembled gardeners, she felt only a calm, professional readiness. Her clipboard was in her hand, and a large, hand-drawn chart illustrating the principles of a four-year rotation was pinned to a portable blackboard behind her. In the front row, Arthur sat with his arms crossed, his expression one of fierce, proprietary pride. Sarah was beside him, smiling encouragement. And at the very back of the hall, leaning against the wall near the door, was Silas. He was just a shape in the shadows, but his presence was a foundation beneath the creaking floorboards.

“Good evening,” Eleanor began, her voice clear and steady, carrying easily to the back of the hall. “Most of us think of our soil as a simple medium for growing plants. But I’d like to suggest we think of it differently. I’d like you to think of your soil as your primary capital asset.” A murmur of interest went through the room. This was language they were not expecting, but it resonated with their own experiences of boom and bust, of inexplicable failures and surprise successes. “Like any asset,” she continued, “it can be improved with careful investment, or it can be depleted through mismanagement, leaving you with diminishing returns year after year. The single most effective, long-term investment strategy you can employ to protect this asset is a system of methodical crop rotation.” For twenty minutes, she spoke with passion and precision, translating the ancient wisdom of the land into the clear, irrefutable language of business. She spoke of nitrogen-fixers as deposits, and heavy-feeding brassicas as withdrawals. She described companion planting as a form of mutual insurance. She was not just giving them tips; she was giving them a system, a framework for understanding the invisible transactions that governed their muddy little kingdoms. When she finished, there was a moment of silence, and then the room erupted in a wave of enthusiastic applause and a forest of raised hands.

Afterwards, as she was mobbed with questions about potato scab and carrot fly, she saw Silas slip out of the door, his silent duty of observation complete. He did not need to offer congratulations; his quiet presence had been the ultimate endorsement. She walked home later through the dark, quiet streets, her folder of notes under her arm, feeling a sense of deep, weary satisfaction that was entirely new to her. She had not performed. She had taught. She had taken her own hard-won knowledge and shared it, making her community stronger, more resilient, more solvent. The silver trowel she had won at The Imperial sat on her mantelpiece, but this feeling, this sense of being a useful, integral part of a living community, was the real prize.

Winter arrived, stripping the trees bare and lashing the windows with cold rain. Eleanor’s work moved indoors, a comforting cycle of planning meetings, soil sample analysis, and the drawing of intricate, hopeful maps for the spring. Her own garden was sleeping under a thick mulch of compost, the bulbs waiting patiently in the cold, dark earth. Her life had found its rhythm, a peaceful, productive balance between sociable consultation and solitary, focused work. She rarely thought of Gregory, or of Abernathy & Codd. They belonged to a different volume of her life’s accounts, a book that had been audited, closed, and moved to a distant, unvisited archive.

One Saturday, she took the bus to the allotment, a newly completed plan for a client in her bag. The place was quiet, almost deserted under the low, grey sky. She saw smoke curling from the chimney of Silas’s shed and, on an impulse, she walked towards it. She found him inside, sitting on an upturned crate in the small, warm space, mending a leather strap on an old canvas tool bag. The air smelled of woodsmoke, oiled metal, and him. He looked up as she appeared in the doorway, a shadow against the grey light. “Eleanor,” he said, his use of her first name a quiet, unremarked milestone they had passed some weeks before. “Cold out.” “I was delivering a plan,” she said, stepping inside, out of the wind. “To number 32. He wants to try growing asparagus.” “That’s a long-term investment,” Silas commented, his fingers still busy with the strap. “Fifteen-year crop, if he gets it right.” He nodded towards a small stack of seed catalogues on his workbench, the same ones he had given her a year ago. “Done your ordering for next year?” he asked. “Last week,” she confirmed. “I’m trying a new variety of climbing bean. And I’ve designated a small area for experimentation. A few more unusual herbs.”

He finished his mending, testing the strength of the new stitches with a powerful tug. He put the bag aside. His gaze fell on the master plan for her own garden, which she had brought with her, tucked into the back of her client’s folder. “Let’s see it,” he said. It was not a request, but a simple statement of interest. She unrolled the large sheet of graph paper on the workbench. It was a dense, detailed document, crisscrossed with her neat pencil lines and annotations, refined and amended with the knowledge of a full year’s experience. He leaned over it, his presence beside her solid and warm in the small shed. He didn’t read it like a map. He read it like a familiar story, his finger tracing the path of her rotations, his eye taking in the logic of her companion planting. “You’re putting the sweetcorn there, next to the beans,” he observed. “Good. They help each other.” He pointed to a small, empty square at the sunniest end of the plot. “What’s this?” he asked. “That’s the experimental patch,” she explained. “I haven’t decided what to put there yet. I was thinking about it.” He was silent for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the blank square on the paper, then he looked up and met her eyes. “There’s a plot come free,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “At the end of the row. Next to mine. Committee was asking me if I knew anyone. A full plot. Hard work for one person.” Eleanor’s breath caught in her throat. She looked from his steady gaze to the small, blank square on her plan, a space for experimentation, and then she thought of the much larger blank space he was offering her. A whole new ledger. A plot of land next to his. A place where they could work side-by-side, not as client and advisor, not as master and apprentice, but as neighbours. As partners. A slow smile spread across her face, a smile of pure, unadulterated joy. It was not a question that required an answer. It was a future that was waiting to be planted. “I’ll need a bigger piece of paper,” she said. And in the quiet warmth of the shed, surrounded by the scent of earth and woodsmoke, they stood together and contemplated the vast, rich, and boundless possibilities of the coming spring.The plot was a disaster. A beautiful, glorious, promising disaster. It was a full-sized rectangle of neglect, twice the size of her own immaculate garden, choked with a thick, tangled mat of couch grass, stubborn docks with roots like parsnips, and the insidious, questing tendrils of bindweed. A rusty, bottomless bucket lay on its side in one corner, and the ghost of some long-abandoned bean frame tilted at a drunken angle. To the casual observer, it was a patch of urban wasteland. To Eleanor, standing on its border on a bright, cold day in early January, it was the most magnificent ledger she had ever been presented with. The liabilities were stark, numerous, and challenging. The potential assets were, for now, entirely theoretical. It was a failing business that she had the opportunity to acquire and turn around. The prospect was the most terrifying and exhilarating thing she had ever known. Silas stood beside her, his hands in his pockets, his gaze sweeping over the plot not with dismay, but with the calm, assessing eye of a surveyor. He nudged a thick clump of nettles with his boot. “Good soil under here,” he rumbled. “Nettles only grow in good heart. That’s one in the credit column, to start you off.”

Eleanor’s new master plan was not drawn on a single sheet of graph paper. It required four sheets, carefully taped together, and it covered the entirety of her kitchen table. It was a document of breathtaking ambition and complexity. This was not the simple domestic economy of her back garden; this was industrial-scale production. She spent a week on it, cross-referencing her seed catalogues with her well-thumbed books on soil management. This time, the process was different. Every evening, after he had finished his own work, Silas would let himself into her kitchen, shedding his muddy boots by the door, and they would hold a board meeting. He would pull up a chair, and she would talk him through her thinking. “I’ve allocated the entire top third to the main potato crop,” she’d explain, tracing the lines with her finger. “It gets the most sun, and the soil is lightest there. But I’m worried about the wireworm Arthur mentioned in the plot next door.” Silas would consider this, his brow furrowed. “Plant a row of mustard along the edge in the autumn, after you lift them,” he’d advise. “Dig it in before it sets seed. Wireworm hate it.” Their conversations were a perfect fusion of her strategic, systematic thinking and his deep, intuitive, generational knowledge. He was the archive, and she was the analyst. Together, they drafted a plan that was both exquisitely logical and deeply wise.

The real work began on a weekend of relentless, horizontal rain. The initial, romantic vision of turning a new plot gave way to the brutal, muddy reality of the task. The couch grass did not yield gracefully; its roots formed a dense, subterranean net that had to be dug out and shaken free of soil, foot by laborious foot. It was a war of attrition. They worked in a strange, complementary silence. Silas, with his immense, patient strength, would tackle the densest, most difficult areas, driving his fork deep and heaving up great, matted clods of turf and weed. Eleanor, following in his wake, would take on the secondary task of breaking up the clods, her hands plunging into the cold, wet earth to tease out every last fragment of the pale, tenacious roots. Her muscles, hardened by a year of gardening, now found a new level of endurance. She discovered a deep, rhythmic satisfaction in the sheer physical effort, the feeling of her body being used for its intended purpose, a machine of leverage and strength. At midday, they would retreat to Silas’s shed, their clothes soaked through, and share scalding tea and thick sandwiches, their conversation consisting of brief, practical comments on the morning’s progress. In those quiet moments, surrounded by the scent of damp earth and old tools, Eleanor felt a sense of partnership that ran deeper than any words, a comradeship forged in the shared struggle against the wilderness.

One afternoon, as she knelt in the mud, painstakingly pulling the brittle, white threads of bindweed from a newly cleared patch of soil, she paused and looked at her own hands. They were unrecognisable. The skin was ingrained with dirt that would never fully wash out, the knuckles were scraped, and the palms were hard with calluses. They were not pretty. They were not the hands of a lady, or an accountant, or of Gregory’s polished fiancée. They were the hands of a worker. They were tools, shaped and hardened by their function. She flexed her fingers, feeling the pull of strong, unfamiliar muscles in her forearms. She thought of the countless hours she had once spent tapping at a calculator, her soft hands moving through a sterile, paper world. There had been no ache then, but there had been a profound, creeping weariness, a fatigue of the soul. This physical exhaustion was different. It was a clean, honest ache. It was the satisfying debit entry for a day of tangible accomplishment. The pile of cleared weeds was a foot high. The patch of dark, clean earth at her knees was three feet square. The world was being re-ordered, one handful at a time, and these were the hands that were doing it.

A month into the great reclamation, Eleanor had to go into town to the bank. It was an unavoidable piece of administration, a meeting to consolidate her accounts. She dressed in clean trousers and a smart coat, feeling like she was putting on a costume. The town centre felt alien, a world of hard surfaces and hurrying people. As she was leaving the bank, a glossy sports car, a shade of blue so bright it hurt the eyes, pulled up at the curb opposite. Gregory got out of the driver’s side, looking like he’d stepped straight out of a magazine advertisement. He opened the passenger door, and the woman with the teeth, as Fiona had so accurately described her, emerged, laughing a high, tinkling laugh. Eleanor froze for a second, an involuntary reflex, a ghost of her old self bracing for an encounter. But they didn’t see her. They were wrapped up in their own bright, shiny world. Gregory gestured at a new, ultra-modern block of luxury flats that had just been completed, its glass balconies overlooking the harbour. He was clearly making a sales pitch, his hands carving enthusiastic shapes in the air. Eleanor watched them for a moment, this handsome, successful couple, framed against the backdrop of glass and steel and the dizzying view of the bay. She felt a profound and startling wave of pity for them. Their world was so small, so sterile, so lacking in the honest currency of mud and rain and the slow, miraculous unfurling of a seed. She turned and walked away, towards the bus stop that would take her back to the rich, complicated, difficult reality of her allotment, and she did not give them another thought.

By the time the first pale green signs of spring began to appear in the hedgerows, a significant corner of Plot 23a—as it was now officially known in her ledger—had been tamed. The couch grass was gone, the soil had been double-dug, and a truckload of well-rotted manure from a local farm had been barrowed in and spread across the surface, a dark, fragrant blanket of pure potential. The new compost bins, a magnificent triple-bay structure that Silas had built from scavenged pallets, stood proudly at the top of the plot, ready to begin their slow, alchemical work. One evening, as the last of the watery, golden light faded from the sky, Eleanor and Silas stood side-by-side, surveying their work. The air was cold and clean and smelled of damp earth and manure. They had created a large, dark, perfectly prepared seedbed from a patch of intractable wilderness. The rest of the plot still lay in tangled chaos, a testament to the work that still remained. But this patch, this first, significant victory, was enough. It was the first page of the new ledger, ready and waiting for the season of planting to begin. Silas reached into his pocket and pulled out two apples, smaller and more wrinkled than the one he had given her in the autumn, but still crisp. He handed one to her. “Overwintered,” he said. “Kept well.” They stood in the gathering dusk, the silence broken only by the crisp crunch of the apples. Eleanor looked at the dark, waiting earth, then at the man standing silently beside her, his presence as solid and reassuring as the ground beneath her feet. The scale of the work ahead was still immense, but for the first time, she felt no fear, only a deep, quiet, and boundless sense of anticipation. The plans were drawn. The foundations were laid. They were ready.
