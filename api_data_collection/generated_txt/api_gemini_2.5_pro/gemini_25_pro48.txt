The world, for Toby, was a grid of small, manageable squares. Each blister pack of amlodipine, each neatly stacked box of paracetamol, each amber bottle filled with the precise millilitres of Oramorph—they all fit. They had their place. From his elevated dispensary in the back of a Boots on Armada Way, he looked out over the aisles of toothpaste and shampoo, a general overseeing his placid kingdom. The air smelled of antiseptic, floor polish, and the faint, sweet perfume that seeped from the cosmetics counter. It was a scent of order, of problems that could be solved with the right cream or a twice-daily tablet. Plymouth, outside the wide glass doors, was a different matter. It was a city of perpetual damp, the sky a vast, sagging canvas of grey that dripped onto the limestone of the Guildhall and slicked the cobbles of the Barbican. The sea was a constant, restless presence, a sighing beast that Toby could hear on windy nights, its salty breath creeping through the sash window of his second-floor flat. He liked the sea in theory, the way one likes a lion in a cage. Its immensity was an affront to his carefully curated world of milligrams and expiry dates.

His mother, a woman who had embraced chaos with the same zeal Toby reserved for alphabetising his spice rack, had called him during his lunch break. She’d been remarried for two years now to a man named Geoff, a retired naval engineer with a booming laugh and an impressive collection of ship-in-a-bottle models. The marriage had been a whirlwind affair, leaving Toby feeling like a spectator at a particularly frantic tennis match. Now, there was a new development.

“He’s coming to stay with you, darling,” his mother’s voice chirped, tinny and distant through the receiver. “Just for a little while. A few weeks, maybe?”

Toby paused, a forkful of tuna salad hovering near his mouth. The staff room was empty, the low hum of the refrigerator the only other sound. “He?”

“Liam! Geoff’s boy. You remember Liam.”

Toby remembered a photograph. A sullen-looking teenager with a curtain of black hair and a silver ring in his lip, captured at the wedding. He hadn’t actually been there; some backpacking trip in Thailand had taken precedence. In the photo, he stood slightly apart from the main group, a smudge of discontent in a sea of pastel hats and forced smiles. “I don’t really know him, Mum.”

“Well, this is your chance! He’s wonderful. An artist. So much… energy. He’s just finished a residency in Berlin and he’s a bit at a loose end before his next project. Geoff and I are off on that cruise, you know, the Fjords, and it just seemed perfect. He needs a base, you need the company.”

Toby did not need the company. He had his routine. He had his books, arranged by genre and then author. He had his quiet evenings, listening to Radio 4 with a cup of peppermint tea. The thought of a person with ‘energy’ invading his space made the back of his neck prickle. An artist. That sounded messy. It sounded like turpentine and late nights and loud music.

“Mum, my flat is… compact,” he tried, picturing his spare room, currently a sanctuary of ironing boards and stored winter clothes.

“It’s characterful! And he won’t be any trouble, I promise. He’s very self-sufficient. Just point him towards the sea and he’ll be happy. He loves all that. Think of it as an adventure, Toby.”

Toby did not think of it as an adventure. He thought of it as a foreign body entering a sterile environment. A contamination. But he heard the pleading note in his mother’s voice, the familiar tone that meant she had already promised his compliance. Arguing would be a protracted, messy affair, and Toby avoided mess.

“Alright,” he sighed, the word tasting of defeat. “When?”

“Tomorrow! Isn’t it brilliant?”

The line went dead before he could protest further, leaving him in the humming silence of the staff room. His tuna salad suddenly seemed unappetizing. He looked at the clock on the wall. 13:42. In less than twenty-four hours, the grid of his life was about to be scribbled on.

The next day, the rain was relentless. It wasn't the soft, misty drizzle Plymouth often wore like a veil, but a hard, percussive drumming that hammered against the pharmacy windows and sent shoppers scurrying for cover, their faces grim. It was the kind of weather that frayed nerves. An elderly woman had shouted at him about the price of her corn plasters, and a young man had tried to argue that his prescription for antibiotics should have been a ‘three-for-two’ deal. By the time Toby locked the main doors at six o’clock, his own meticulously ordered composure felt as water-logged as the streets outside. He walked home, his umbrella barely a match for the wind that funnelled down the narrow side streets. The flat, when he reached it, was silent and still. He had spent the morning in a frantic burst of cleaning, transforming the spare room from a glorified cupboard into something that vaguely resembled a place a human could sleep. It looked stark and uninviting.

He was in the middle of making pasta, staring into the roiling water as if it held some great cosmic answer, when the buzzer shrieked. It was a jarring, ugly sound that made him jump. He pressed the intercom button. “Hello?”

A voice crackled back, laced with static and something else—amusement. “Package for Mr. T. Evans. Contains one inconvenient step-brother. Handle with care, contents may be sarcastic.”

Toby felt an involuntary smile twitch at his lips. He buzzed the door open, his stomach performing a strange, nervous flip. He stood at the top of the stairs, wiping his damp hands on a tea towel, and watched him ascend. Liam was no longer the sullen teenager from the photograph. The man climbing the stairs was tall and lean, his movements fluid, almost feline, despite the bulky rucksack on his back and a battered guitar case clutched in one hand. His black hair was shorter now, an artfully messy shag that fell over his brow. He was wearing a soaked leather jacket and jeans with holes in the knees that looked deliberate. When he reached the top of the stairs and looked up, Toby felt a jolt. His eyes were a startling, pale blue, the colour of a gas flame, and they were fixed on Toby with an unnerving directness. A small, silver ring still adorned his lower lip.

“Toby,” he said. It wasn’t a question. He dropped his bags with a heavy thud, filling the small landing. “The pharmacist.”

“Liam,” Toby replied, his own voice sounding stiff and formal in comparison. “The artist.”

Liam grinned, a wide, slow smile that transformed his face, chasing away the last of the Berlin chill. “Guilty. Thanks for this, by the way. I owe you one. Your mum’s a force of nature, isn’t she? I think she had my plane ticket booked before I’d even agreed.”

“She’s… persuasive,” Toby agreed, stepping back to let him in.

The flat seemed to shrink the moment Liam crossed the threshold. He filled it not just with his physical presence, but with an aura of restless motion. He unzipped his jacket, dripping water onto the laminate flooring Toby had polished just hours before. He ran a hand through his damp hair, sending droplets flying. He looked around the living room, his gaze taking in the beige sofa, the carefully aligned coasters on the coffee table, the bookshelf with its spines all perfectly flush.

“Nice,” Liam said, though his tone suggested it was the clinical ‘nice’ one might use for a hospital waiting room. “Very… tidy.”

“I like tidy,” Toby said, a defensive edge to his voice. The water was pooling by the door. He had to physically restrain himself from running to get a cloth. “Your room’s this way.”

He led him to the spare room. Liam dumped his rucksack on the bed, the springs groaning in protest. He peered out the small window at the slate roof of the building opposite, slick with rain. “So this is Plymouth,” he mused. “Smells of salt and regret.”

“It’s just the rain,” Toby said automatically. “The pasta’s nearly ready. I hope you eat pesto.”

“I eat anything that doesn’t eat me first.” Liam turned from the window, his blue eyes crinkling at the corners. “So, a pharmacist, huh? Must be weird, dealing out drugs all day. Little bottles of happiness and forgetfulness.”

“It’s mostly blood pressure medication and fungal nail cream,” Toby corrected him, feeling the need to ground the conversation in reality. “It’s not as poetic as it sounds.”

“Everything’s poetic if you look at it right,” Liam countered, following him back into the kitchen. He leaned against the counter, long legs crossed at the ankle, watching Toby drain the pasta with an unnerving intensity. He was a spectator in Toby’s own home, and Toby found he didn't know the rules of this new game. “You ever get tempted? To just… mix things up? A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Create a new feeling.”

“That’s illegal. And it would get me struck off the register,” Toby said, his voice flat. The idea was absurd, a violation of every principle he held. He divided the pasta onto two plates, his movements precise, almost robotic.

“I’m not saying you *should*,” Liam laughed, a low, husky sound. “I’m just asking if you’re tempted. Everyone’s tempted by a little bit of chaos, right? Even the tidy people.”

Toby didn’t answer. He just handed a plate to Liam. They ate standing in the kitchen, the silence punctuated by the clink of forks against ceramic and the steady drumming of the rain outside. It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence, though. It was watchful. Toby was acutely aware of Liam beside him, the scent of wet leather, rain, and something else, something faintly spicy and utterly foreign. He could feel Liam’s gaze on him from time to time, and when he risked a glance, he found those bright, searching eyes looking not at the flat, not at the food, but right at him. It made a strange heat rise in his chest, a warmth that had nothing to do with the pasta. For the first time, Toby considered his mother’s words. Maybe, just maybe, this wouldn’t be an adventure. It would be something far more dangerous.

In the days that followed, Liam’s presence was a low-level tremor that constantly threatened to upset the neat geology of Toby’s life. He was an organism of the night. Toby would rise at six-thirty, tiptoeing around in the grey pre-dawn light, and the door to the spare room would be firmly shut. But when Toby returned from work, the flat would be transformed. Music, usually something loud and jagged with guitars, would be pulsing from a small portable speaker. The coffee table would be littered with charcoal sticks, sketchpads, and half-empty mugs. And Liam would be there, a whirlwind of creative energy, his hands and often his face smudged with black. He was drawing the view from the window, but not as Toby saw it. In Liam’s sketches, the slate roofs opposite became a tumbling, abstract landscape of sharp angles and deep shadows. The gulls weren't birds; they were frantic, jagged slashes of white against a bruised sky. He was deconstructing Toby’s world and reassembling it into something wilder, something more honest.

“You see things in black and white, don’t you?” Liam said one evening, holding up a drawing. He hadn’t been speaking to Toby, just thinking aloud.

Toby looked up from his newspaper. “That’s charcoal. It’s supposed to be black and white.”

Liam shook his head, a half-smile playing on his lips. “No, I mean *you*. Your life. Yes or no. Right or wrong. Dispense or do not dispense. There’s no grey area.”

“Grey areas are where mistakes are made,” Toby said, folding his newspaper with a crisp snap. “In my job, a mistake in a grey area could kill someone.”

“Dramatic.” Liam put the sketch down and stretched, his t-shirt riding up to reveal a sliver of pale skin and the dark line of his jeans. Toby’s eyes snagged on it for a fraction of a second too long, and he quickly looked away, his face feeling hot. “My point is, life isn’t a pharmacy. It’s all grey area. That’s where the good stuff is. The fun.”

To Toby, ‘fun’ was a successful stock-take. Fun was finding a rare first edition in a second-hand bookshop. Liam’s idea of fun, it turned out, was very different. One afternoon, Toby came home to find him sitting cross-legged on the living room floor, surrounded by maps of Devon and Cornwall.

“We’re going on a mission,” Liam announced, his eyes alight with excitement.

“I have work tomorrow,” Toby said.

“Tomorrow is Saturday. You work a half-day. We go after. Operation: Find a Decent Fucking Wave.” Liam’s finger stabbed at a point on the map near Bantham. “Geoff told me this place is good. I need to get in the sea before I grow moss.”

“I don’t have a surfboard,” Toby pointed out, feeling a familiar wave of reluctance.

“I’ll rent you one. It’ll be an education. I’m going to teach you the beauty of getting pummelled by nature.”

And so, against his better judgment, Toby found himself driving his sensible Ford Fiesta down winding country lanes on Saturday afternoon, with Liam in the passenger seat, tapping a frantic rhythm on the dashboard in time to a song that sounded like a robot having a seizure. The car smelled of salt and neoprene from the wetsuits Liam had insisted on hiring. The sky, for once, was a vast, brilliant blue. As they crested the final hill and the beach spread out below them—a perfect crescent of pale gold sand, fringed with dunes and lapped by lines of white surf—Toby felt an uncharacteristic flutter of anticipation.

The water was shockingly cold, a full-body gasp that stole the air from his lungs. Liam, however, was in his element. He moved through the surf with a grace that was startling, paddling his board out with powerful, easy strokes. Toby, meanwhile, felt like a drowning donkey. He was clumsy and awkward, the board a cumbersome, unwieldy beast that seemed determined to either flip him off or hit him in the head. He spent most of the first hour swallowing seawater and getting tangled in his own leash. He was about to give up, to retreat to the safety of his towel on the sand, when Liam paddled over to him, his face split by a huge grin, water beading on his eyelashes.

“You’re thinking too much,” he shouted over the roar of a breaking wave. “You’re trying to *organise* the ocean. You can’t. You just have to feel it.”

He positioned Toby’s board, his hands briefly brushing Toby’s on the rails. The touch was electric, a spark of warmth in the freezing water. “Okay, here comes a little one. Don’t think, just paddle. And when you feel it lift you, just… go.”

A small, green wall of water rolled towards them. Toby’s instinct was to hesitate, to analyse, to calculate the odds of failure. But Liam’s voice was in his ear, confident and compelling. “Now, Toby! Go!” He paddled, his arms burning with the unfamiliar effort. He felt the wave catch the tail of the board, a sudden, thrilling surge of power, a lift from behind. He pushed up, scrambling to his knees, his balance precarious. For three, maybe four seconds, he was actually riding the wave, skimming across the face of it, the world a blur of green water and blue sky. Then he overbalanced, toppling sideways with a great splash. He surfaced, spluttering and laughing, a real, genuine laugh that came from his belly. Liam was there, treading water, his face radiant.

“See?” he yelled, his voice full of triumph. “Grey area! The good stuff!”

Later, they sat on the dunes, wrapped in towels, sharing a flask of lukewarm tea from Toby’s sensible travel kit. The sun was beginning to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in lurid shades of orange and pink. Liam was sketching again, his charcoal stick flying across the page, capturing the last of the light. Toby watched him, the way his brow furrowed in concentration, the effortless grace of his hands. The cold, the exhaustion, the saltwater still stinging his eyes—it all felt strangely wonderful. He felt alive in a way he hadn't in a long time. The rigid grid of his life had been washed away, just for an afternoon, leaving behind the exhilarating, terrifying possibility of a blank page. He looked from the fiery, chaotic beauty of the sunset to the man beside him, who seemed to be a part of it, a concentration of all its wild energy. And in the quiet space between the sigh of the wind and the crash of the waves, Toby felt a feeling he couldn't name, something that had no place on a prescription pad, something that felt a lot like falling.The ache started in his shoulders. A dull, protesting throb that spread down his back and into his arms. Toby woke to this new, unfamiliar pain and, for a moment, was disoriented. Then it came back to him in a rush: the cold shock of the water, the burn in his muscles as he paddled, the exhilarating, terrifying lift of the wave. He lay still in the pale morning light, listening. The flat was silent, but it was a different kind of silence now. It was no longer empty. It was simply quiet, holding its breath, waiting for the other occupant to stir. He slipped out of bed and was met with the evidence of their adventure in the hallway. Two wetsuits were hanging over the shower rail in the bathroom, dripping a slow, steady rhythm into the tub, their rubbery scent mingling with the toothpaste. A fine dusting of sand, pale gold and stubbornly persistent, traced a path from the front door to the living room. In his pre-Liam existence, this would have sent him into a frenzy of cleaning. Now, he just looked at it, a faint smile on his face. It was the residue of a good day.

At work, the pharmacy felt more sterile than ever, the air-conditioned hum more monotonous. The neat boxes on the shelves, usually a source of comfort, seemed inert and lifeless. Mrs. Higgins came in for her weekly gossip and blood pressure check, and her chatter about her neighbour’s prize-winning roses washed over him without registering. He dispensed prescriptions with his usual accuracy, his hands moving through the familiar motions, but his mind was elsewhere. It was in the churning green water, on a windswept dune, watching a pair of clever hands bring a sunset to life with a stick of charcoal. He found himself thinking about Liam’s comment, “Everything’s poetic if you look at it right.” He looked at the blister pack of statins in his hand. A tiny, daily defence against the chaos of the body’s own betrayals. A small, organised rebellion against mortality. He almost laughed. Perhaps Liam was right.

The dynamic in the flat shifted. It was subtle, a change in atmospheric pressure rather than a seismic event. Liam no longer felt like an invader, but a component of the space, albeit a chaotic one. His sketches began to migrate from his room, colonising the living area. A charcoal rendering of a cormorant drying its wings was taped to the fridge door. A series of expressive, abstract studies of water and light were propped against the wall by the sofa. Toby stopped trying to tidy them away. They were becoming part of the landscape of his home, and he found he liked the view. He also found himself watching Liam with a new, unguarded curiosity. He noticed the way Liam bit his lower lip—the one with the ring—when he was concentrating on a drawing, the way his brow furrowed. He learned the specific creak of the floorboard outside the spare room that signalled Liam was finally waking up, usually around noon. They fell into a comfortable, unspoken routine. Toby’s quiet mornings, Liam’s creative afternoons, and shared, easy evenings where the television was rarely on. They’d eat whatever Liam had concocted—usually something flavourful and thrown together with a disregard for recipes—and talk, or simply coexist in the small space, the air thick with the smell of turpentine and peppermint tea.

One Tuesday, Toby came home to a flat that was unnervingly quiet. No music. No sound of scratching charcoal. The living room was tidy, the mugs cleared away. A prickle of alarm went up his spine. He pushed open the door to the spare room, which was usually left ajar. Liam was curled up in bed, a mound under the duvet, his face pale and slick with sweat. His breath was coming in shallow rasps. The whirlwind was still. Toby’s professional instincts surged to the forefront, sharp and clear. He crossed the room and placed the back of his hand against Liam’s forehead. He was burning up.
“Liam?” Toby’s voice was soft, but firm.
Liam’s eyes fluttered open. The usual gas-flame blue was clouded and dull. “Toby,” he rasped, his voice rough. “Feel like I’ve been hit by a bus.”
“You’ve got a fever. A bad one, by the looks of it.” Toby’s pharmacist-mode was fully engaged. He was calm, efficient. “Have you taken anything?”
Liam shook his head, a slight movement that seemed to cost him a great deal of effort. “Don’t… do pills.”
Toby almost scoffed. “Don’t be an idiot. You’re an artist, not a faith healer. I’ll get you some paracetamol and a glass of water.”
He returned a moment later with the tablets and a glass. He had to help Liam sit up, one arm around his sweat-damp back, holding him steady. Liam felt surprisingly fragile, his usual vibrant energy entirely extinguished. He swallowed the pills with a grimace and sank back against the pillows, his eyes closing. “Thanks,” he mumbled. Toby stood there for a moment, looking at him. The man who surfed and sketched and filled his quiet flat with noise now seemed small and vulnerable. An unexpected wave of fierce protectiveness washed over Toby. It was an entirely new feeling, and it was potent. He went to the kitchen, filled a hot water bottle, and came back, tucking it under the duvet by Liam’s feet. He found a clean cloth, dampened it with cool water, and gently laid it on Liam’s forehead. Liam sighed, a sound of pure relief, and his tense body seemed to relax a little. Toby pulled a chair from the corner and sat down, watching him breathe. The artist was out of commission. The pharmacist was on duty.

He worked from home the next day, citing a plumbing emergency. The lie came with surprising ease. He couldn't shake the image of Liam, pale and alone in the flat. He spent the day in a strange state of dual-focus, answering emails from the pharmacy on his laptop while listening for any sound from the spare room. He checked on Liam every hour, administering doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen with clockwork precision, coaxing him to drink water and eat small spoonfuls of soup. Liam was mostly asleep, drifting in and out of a feverish haze. In a moment of lucidity, he looked at Toby, his eyes clearer than before.
“You’re a good nurse,” he whispered.
“I’m a good pharmacist,” Toby corrected, a little flustered. “I just know the correct dosage intervals for antipyretics.”
Liam managed a weak smile. “Nah. It’s more than that. You… fuss. It’s nice.”
The word ‘fuss’ hung in the air. Toby did fuss. He had plumped the pillows. He had changed the water in the glass three times to ensure it was fresh. He had even considered buying a thermometer on his lunch break before remembering he was supposed to be at home with a plumber. This level of care wasn't in any medical textbook. It was something else, something he was trying very hard not to analyse. By evening, the fever had broken. Liam was sitting up in bed, propped against the pillows, looking washed out but human again. He was wearing one of Toby’s old t-shirts, a plain grey one that was too big for him. Toby brought him a cup of tea.

“So,” Liam said, his voice still a little hoarse. “This is what happens when you try to organise me. I break.”
“You just have the flu,” Toby said, sitting on the edge of the chair. “It’s a virus. It has a predictable life cycle.”
Liam chuckled, a low, breathy sound. “Always with the science. You know, I don’t think I’ve ever had someone look after me like this. Not since I was a kid.” He looked down into his mug. “My mum wasn’t the… fussing type. More the ‘here’s a fiver, go buy yourself some Lemsip’ type.”
Toby thought of his own mother, whose love was a loud, chaotic, overwhelming force, a whirlwind of good intentions and forgotten details. “My mum’s the opposite. She’d have smothered you in Vick’s VapoRub and force-fed you chicken soup until you begged for mercy.”
They both smiled. It was the first time they had spoken of their parents, the two people who had, through a bizarre twist of fate, brought them together. A comfortable quiet settled in the room, underscored by the gentle ticking of Toby’s alarm clock on the bedside table.
“Why did you?” Liam asked, his gaze direct.
“Why did I what?”
“Become a pharmacist. It’s so… precise. So ordered. Was that always you?”
Toby looked at his hands, which were resting on his knees. He thought for a moment, wanting to give an honest answer. “I think so. My childhood was… loud. Messy. My mum, she’s wonderful, but she’s chaos in human form. Things were always being lost, or forgotten, or breaking. I think I just craved a bit of quiet. A bit of order. A place where if you followed the instructions, everything would be alright. Where things had a proper place.” He risked a glance at Liam. “The pharmacy is that place.”
Liam was watching him, his blue eyes soft and serious. He wasn't looking at ‘Toby the pharmacist’ anymore. He was looking at Toby. “And does it work?” he asked quietly. “Is everything alright?”
Toby’s carefully constructed world, the grid he had lived by for so long, suddenly felt thin, like paper. The truth was, it was a defence mechanism, not a solution. It kept the world at bay, but it also kept the good stuff out. The grey areas. He thought of the roaring sea, the burn of the cold, the brief, perfect moment on the wave. He looked at the man in his bed, this agent of chaos who had somehow brought more peace to his flat than all his tidying ever had.
“No,” Toby admitted, the word barely a whisper. “Not always.”
Liam reached out then, his hand covering Toby’s on his knee. His skin was still warm from the fever, his touch gentle but firm. It wasn't a spark this time, not like in the cold ocean. It was a slow, spreading heat that seemed to travel up Toby’s arm and settle directly in his chest. Toby’s breath hitched. He didn't pull away. He simply sat there, his world tilting on its axis, his hand held captive by the artist with the fever-bright eyes. The rain started again outside, a soft patter against the window, but the only storm Toby was aware of was the one raging inside him.The world contracted to that single point of contact. The heat from Liam’s hand was a foreign country, and Toby was an unwilling immigrant, his papers not in order. His mind, a fortress of logic and classification, was being breached. He could list the active ingredients in every sleeping pill on the market, but he could not name the potent, unlabelled cocktail of panic and longing that was flooding his system. The silence in the room deepened, broken only by the soft drumming of the rain, a sound that now seemed to be counting the beats of Toby’s frantic heart. Liam didn’t move, his thumb stroking gently over Toby’s knuckles, a small, deliberate gesture that sent a fresh shockwave through him. He was being seen. Not just observed, but truly seen, and the feeling was as terrifying as it was addictive.

Slowly, carefully, as if handling a fragile piece of glassware, Toby turned his hand over and curled his fingers around Liam’s. It was a concession, a surrender. It was the bravest thing he had done all year. A slow smile spread across Liam’s face, not his usual wide, mischievous grin, but something softer, more private. The fever had left his eyes clear and startlingly bright, and they held Toby’s gaze with a gentle, questioning intensity. He didn’t say anything. The words weren't necessary. The room was full of them anyway. The unspoken admission hung between them, more tangible than the scent of rain and old books. When Liam finally let go, the absence of his touch left Toby’s skin feeling cold, his hand strangely empty.

In the week that followed, the air in the flat was charged with a new kind of electricity. Liam’s strength returned in a rush, his natural energy reasserting itself, but it was different now. It was less of a whirlwind and more of a magnetic field, with Toby at its centre. The casual brushes in the narrow hallway lingered a second too long. The glances held a weight they hadn't before. One evening, Toby was on the sofa reading, lost in a biography, when he felt the familiar sensation of being watched. He looked up to see Liam sitting on the floor, leaning against the opposite armchair, a sketchbook open on his lap. He wasn’t sketching the rain-slicked roofs or the gulls. He was sketching Toby. His charcoal stick moved with a fluid, confident speed, his eyes flicking from the page to Toby’s face. Toby felt a blush creep up his neck.

“Don’t stop,” Liam said quietly, his gaze intense. “You have this look when you’re reading. Like you’re trying to memorise the world to keep it from falling apart.” Toby’s instinct was to close the book, to hide his face, to protest that he was a terrible subject. But he didn't. He swallowed, his throat suddenly dry, and returned his eyes to the page, though the words now swam before him, meaningless. He was intensely aware of his own stillness, of the way he held his head, of the curve of his hands holding the book. He was being captured, deconstructed and reassembled by Liam’s gaze, and for the first time, he wasn’t afraid of how the pieces would fit together.

Later that night, after Liam had gone to bed, Toby found the sketchbook left on the coffee table. He hesitated, feeling like a trespasser, but his curiosity was a physical ache. He opened it. There were pages of him. Toby staring into the boiling pasta water, his brow furrowed in concentration. Toby at the kitchen counter, his glasses pushed up on his head, a half-smile on his face as he listened to the radio. Toby asleep on the sofa, his book fallen onto his chest, his face unguarded and peaceful. Liam hadn’t just drawn his likeness; he had drawn his quiet moments, his private rituals. He had seen the poetry in the mundane, the very thing Toby had denied existed. In Liam’s bold, dark strokes, Toby wasn't just tidy and ordered; he was serene, thoughtful, a calm anchor in a chaotic world. A warmth bloomed in his chest, a feeling so profound it almost hurt.

The phone call came on a Sunday morning, a bright, blustery day when the sun kept appearing and disappearing behind fast-moving clouds. It was his mother, her voice effervescent with the joy of a good holiday and poor mobile reception. “…and the Northern Lights, Toby, you’ve never seen anything so magical! We’ll be docking in Southampton on Friday. Can you believe it’s been nearly three weeks? Geoff can’t wait to see Liam. Hasn’t it been wonderful having him there?” The word ‘Friday’ landed in Toby’s stomach like a stone. Friday. Four days away. The end of the arrangement. The end of this strange, fragile, beautiful thing that had taken root in his beige living room.

“It’s been fine, Mum,” he said, his voice sounding hollow to his own ears. Liam, who was making coffee, turned to look at him, his expression unreadable. “Yes, he’s been no trouble.” The words were a lie, a colossal understatement. Liam had been nothing but trouble. He had troubled the quiet surface of Toby’s life, troubled his routines, and troubled his heart into beating a new and terrifying rhythm. After he hung up, a heavy silence fell over the kitchen. Liam poured two mugs of coffee and pushed one across the counter towards Toby.

“So, the circus is leaving town,” Liam said, his voice carefully neutral. He wasn't looking at Toby, but at the coffee swirling in his mug.
“Your dad will be back,” Toby replied, stating the obvious because it was the only safe thing to say.
“Yeah.” Liam took a sip. “Guess I’ll need to find my own place. Start the next project. Plenty to draw around here. All that salt and regret.” He was trying for his old sarcasm, but it fell flat. It sounded like a defence. Toby’s carefully ordered world was threatening to snap back into place, to eject the foreign body, and the thought of the ensuing silence, the emptiness, was unbearable.
“You don’t have to go,” Toby said, the words tumbling out before he could stop them, before he could check them for dosage or side effects.
Liam finally looked up, his blue eyes searching Toby’s face. “My dad and your mum will be back. The arrangement is over.”
“It doesn’t have to be an arrangement,” Toby insisted, his hands gripping the edge of the counter. This was it. The grey area. He was stepping into it, with no map and no instructions. “My spare room… it’s better with you in it. The flat is better. I’m better.” The confession left him breathless, exposed. He waited for Liam’s dismissal, for the easy, charming deflection.
Instead, Liam put his mug down and closed the small distance between them. He stopped right in front of Toby, so close Toby could feel the warmth radiating from his body. He smelled of coffee and charcoal and the unique, spicy scent that was just Liam. “Is that a clinical opinion, pharmacist?” he asked, his voice low and soft.
“No,” Toby whispered, his gaze fixed on the silver ring in Liam’s lip. “It’s not.”
“Good,” Liam murmured, and then he leaned in and closed the final gap, his mouth finding Toby’s. It wasn’t a frantic kiss, but one of slow discovery, a question and an answer all at once. It was soft and warm and tasted of coffee and the exhilarating, terrifying relief of finally saying yes. In that moment, Toby’s world wasn’t a grid of squares anymore. It was a vast, chaotic, brilliant canvas, and he was right in the middle of it, finally ready to make a mess.When the kiss ended, it was Toby who broke away, but only by a fraction. He rested his forehead against Liam’s, his eyes closed, his entire being focused on the unfamiliar sensations: the warmth of Liam’s skin, the faint metallic tang of the silver ring against his lips, the unsteady rhythm of his own breathing. His analytical mind, which could cross-reference drug interactions in seconds, was utterly offline. It searched for a category, a label, a neat box to put this feeling in, and came back with nothing but a brilliant, shimmering blank. It was an information overload of the heart. The silence of the kitchen rushed back in to fill the space, but it was a changed silence, thick with possibility.

“Well,” Liam murmured, his voice a low vibration that travelled from his chest to Toby’s. “That was… overdue.” He didn’t move away, giving Toby the space he needed to reboot his overwhelmed systems. Toby took a shuddering breath and opened his eyes. He was looking at the familiar beige tiles of his own kitchen splashback, but they seemed different, somehow brighter. Everything seemed brighter.

“I don’t know what the protocol is for this,” Toby admitted, his voice barely a whisper. The statement was so quintessentially *him* that Liam let out a soft, breathy laugh. He pulled back just enough to look Toby in the eye, his hands coming up to gently cup Toby’s jaw.

“There is no protocol, pharmacist,” he said, his thumbs tracing the line of Toby’s cheekbones. “That’s the whole point. We just… see what happens next.” He leaned in and kissed him again, a brief, gentle press of lips that was pure reassurance. It was a statement: *This is real. This is happening.* This time, Toby didn’t flinch. He leaned into it, a man who had spent his life reading instructions finally throwing the manual away. The coffee sat on the counter, forgotten and growing cold. The ticking clock of his mother’s return was momentarily silenced. For now, there was only the small, warm kitchen and the exhilarating, terrifying knowledge that the world had just cracked wide open.

The next few days passed in a strange, golden haze. The flat, once Toby’s solitary sanctuary of order, became their shared territory, a space humming with a quiet, joyful energy. The unspoken tension that had defined their cohabitation was replaced by an easy intimacy that surprised Toby with its rightness. It manifested in small, significant ways. It was Liam’s hand finding his as they watched a film, their fingers lacing together on the beige sofa cushion. It was Toby coming home from work to find Liam had saved him a plate, keeping it warm in the oven. It was the way Liam would now come and lean in the doorway of the bathroom while Toby brushed his teeth, simply watching him with a fond, sleepy smile before heading to bed.

Toby found his own rigid routines softening at the edges. He stopped tidying away Liam’s sketches, instead finding himself pausing to admire a new drawing of the harbour, the boats rendered as restless, dynamic shapes against the water. One morning, lost in a kiss that started over the kettle, he was seven minutes late leaving for work. The flicker of panic was swiftly replaced by a giddy, rebellious thrill. As he power-walked to the pharmacy, the smile on his face felt illicit and wonderful. His world of milligrams and expiry dates hadn't vanished, but it no longer held dominion. It was just one part of the canvas, no longer the entire grid.

Wednesday evening found them on the Hoe, a biting wind whipping in from the Sound. Liam, bundled in his leather jacket, had insisted they needed to get out, to breathe air that wasn’t tinged with turpentine. They walked along the promenade, past Smeaton's Tower, its red and white stripes a bold slash against the brooding grey sky. The sea was a churning, metallic grey, capped with white foam. It was immense and chaotic, the very thing Toby used to dislike from the safety of his window. But walking beside Liam, his shoulder brushing Toby’s, the immense chaos felt different. It felt like freedom.

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Liam shouted over the wind, his hair whipping across his face. “All that power. It doesn’t give a shit about you. It’s humbling.”

Toby looked from the crashing waves to Liam’s face, which was alive with exhilaration, his pale eyes bright against the wind-reddened skin. He finally understood. Liam didn’t just see the chaos; he saw the beauty in it, the honesty. He didn’t fight it. He rode it. Toby reached out and took Liam’s cold hand, their fingers tangling together. Liam’s answering smile was as bright and sudden as a lighthouse beam. In that moment, Toby didn’t feel humbled by the ocean’s power; he felt buoyed by it, part of its vast, unpredictable energy.

The domestic bubble, however, was fragile. The knowledge of Friday’s arrival loomed. It was Toby who finally punctured it, the anxiety becoming too much to contain. They were in the kitchen on Thursday night. Liam was cooking, chopping vegetables with a rhythmic, percussive flair, while Toby was ostensibly drying the dishes, but was mostly just watching him, feeling a sense of preemptive loss.

“They’ll be here tomorrow afternoon,” Toby said, his voice tight. He polished a wine glass with more force than was necessary. Liam stopped chopping, the knife resting on the board. He turned, leaning his hips back against the counter.

“I know.”

“My mum will… notice,” Toby continued, stating the obvious. It was a massive understatement. His mother noticed everything, and what she didn’t notice, she invented. “She’ll ask questions. She’ll have theories. She’ll probably start planning a wedding.” The words came out in a rush of dread.

Liam’s expression softened. He wiped his hands on a tea towel and crossed the small space, taking the wine glass from Toby’s hands and setting it carefully on the counter. “Hey,” he said, his voice gentle. “Look at me.” Toby met his gaze reluctantly. “What do you want to do? We can go back to the way it was. Inconvenient step-brother, tidy pharmacist. I can sleep in the spare room. We can be… polite.” The word sounded foul in his mouth. “Is that what you want?”

The thought was like a punch to the gut. The silence returning. The empty space on the sofa. The absence of Liam’s warmth next to him in bed, where he had migrated two nights ago as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Going back to that sterile order felt like choosing illness after a brief, tantalising taste of health. “No,” Toby said, the word raw and certain. “No. I don’t want that.”

“Okay, then,” Liam said, his hands finding Toby’s. “So we don’t. We just… are. Whatever this is. Your mum can plan all the weddings she wants. We don’t have to RSVP.” A corner of his mouth lifted. “We tell them the truth. Or, you know, our version of it. That I came to stay, and I’m not leaving just yet. The details are none of their business.” He squeezed Toby’s hands. “We can handle your mum. Together.”

The word ‘together’ was the anchor. It settled the frantic fluttering in Toby’s chest. He looked at Liam—at his calm, steady eyes, his confident stance, the unwavering support in his expression—and felt a surge of courage. Liam wasn't just a disruption to his grid; he was a whole new coordinate system. A better one. Toby nodded, a slow, decisive movement. “Okay,” he said, his voice firm. “Together.” The impending arrival was no longer a tidal wave threatening to drown him. It was just a wave. And he was learning, finally, how to ride it.Friday at the pharmacy was an exercise in controlled panic. Toby performed his duties with a brittle, high-gloss efficiency, his mind a frantic split-screen. On one side, he was calculating dosages and counselling patients on the correct use of inhalers. On the other, he was running through a hundred disastrous scenarios for the afternoon’s reunion. His mother’s voice, chirping with joy. Geoff’s booming laugh echoing in his small living room. The questions. The observations. The inevitable, well-intentioned, tidal wave of chaos that was his mother’s love. He felt like a man preparing for a hurricane by straightening the pictures on his walls. By the time he locked the doors at one o’clock, his nerves were shot. Walking home, he felt the familiar dread coiling in his stomach, but this time, it was mingled with something else: a stubborn, protective resolve.

He opened the flat door to the smell of lemon and baking. The floors were gleaming, but Liam’s charcoal sketches remained on the walls, a defiant exhibition of their new reality. Liam was standing in the kitchen, pulling a tray of what looked like scones from the oven. He was wearing an apron—one of Toby’s, a plain navy blue one—and there was a smudge of flour on his cheek. He looked up and grinned, a thoroughly domestic sight that did strange, acrobatic things to Toby’s heart.

“Stress baking,” Liam announced, nudging the tray with an oven-mitted hand. “My go-to coping mechanism. Figured if your mum’s going to descend, we should at least have carbs to throw at her.” He saw the tension in Toby’s face and his smile softened. He took off the oven mitts and stepped closer, wiping the flour from his cheek with the back of his hand, leaving a faint white streak behind. “Hey. We’ve got this. Remember? Together.” He didn’t touch Toby, but his presence was a tangible comfort, a shield. Toby took a deep breath, the scent of warm scones and lemon polish filling his lungs. It smelled, unexpectedly, like home.

The buzzer shrieked at precisely 3:17 p.m., fifteen minutes earlier than his mother’s ETA, which was, in itself, perfectly on schedule. Toby jumped. Liam just smirked and went to the intercom. “Plymouth City Pizzeria, how can I help you?” he said into the receiver. A flurry of indignant, tinny squawks came through the speaker, followed by Geoff’s hearty laugh. Liam buzzed them in, his eyes dancing with amusement. “Break the tension,” he whispered to Toby, who was frozen by the top of the stairs. “Always works.”

His mother, whose name was Elaine, ascended the stairs like a weather system. She was a whirlwind of brightly coloured scarves, clanking bracelets, and oversized luggage that bumped against the walls. Geoff followed in her wake, a solid, calming presence with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder, looking exactly as he did in the wedding photos. Elaine reached the landing, dropped her bags, and enveloped Toby in a hug that smelled of airport perfume and hairspray. “Toby, darling! You look thin! Are you eating? Oh, your flat looks wonderful! What have you done? It looks so… lived in!” She released him and immediately turned her full, high-wattage attention to Liam, pulling him into an equally effusive embrace. “And you! Look at you, you gorgeous boy! Thriving in the damp! Geoff, doesn’t he look like he’s thriving?”

“He certainly looks less like a Berlin art-house film and more like a human being,” Geoff boomed, clapping Liam on the shoulder. The small landing was impossibly crowded, filled with their bodies, their luggage, and their sheer volume. Toby felt the walls closing in, his carefully constructed calm beginning to fray. Liam, sensing it, subtly shifted to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him, a small, grounding act of solidarity.

Elaine swept into the living room, her eyes darting everywhere, missing nothing. “Oh, scones! Liam, you angel! And the drawings! You’ve put them up! Toby, isn’t it wonderful? It gives the place so much… energy!” She was a detective on a sugar rush, assembling clues with breathless speed. She noted the two mugs by the sink, the way Liam knew where the tea was without having to ask, the comfortable, worn-in arrangement of the sofa cushions. Toby watched her, holding his breath, waiting for the inevitable conclusion. It came sooner than he expected. They were all standing in the kitchen, Elaine recounting a dramatic story about a lost passport in Oslo, when Toby, without thinking, reached for a scone. Liam, at the same moment, reached for the jam, opened the jar, and passed it to him, their hands brushing, their movements a seamless, unspoken piece of choreography born of shared habit.

Elaine stopped talking mid-sentence. The sudden silence was more jarring than her chatter had been. She looked at the jar of jam in Toby’s hand. She looked at Liam, who was now calmly buttering a scone for himself. She looked at Toby, whose face was rapidly turning a shade of crimson that clashed horribly with his beige walls. A slow, beatific smile spread across her face, and her eyes, which were a paler, more scattered version of Liam’s, filled with tears.

“Oh,” she breathed, her voice thick with emotion. She pressed a hand to her chest. “Oh, Toby.”

Toby braced himself for the explosion. For the questions, the fuss, the mess. But Geoff, bless his straightforward naval-engineer heart, stepped in. He put a large, warm hand on Elaine’s shoulder. “Now, now, love. Let the boys have their tea.” He turned to Liam and Toby, his expression one of simple, uncomplicated warmth. “Glad to see you’re looking after our boy, Toby. And him you.” He picked up a scone. “Right then. Is this jam home-made?” The diversion was obvious, but it was kind. It was a gift of time, a moment for them all to breathe.

But Elaine could not be diverted for long. The tears overflowed, silent and happy, trickling down her cheeks. She swiped at them with the back of her hand, beaming at Toby and Liam as if they had just presented her with a winning lottery ticket. “It’s just so lovely,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “My careful boy, and Geoff’s wild one. I just knew you’d be good for each other.” She looked from one to the other, her gaze full of a fierce, proprietary joy. It wasn’t the interrogation Toby had feared. It was something far more overwhelming: immediate, unconditional, and utterly public acceptance. The tidy, compartmentalised boxes in Toby’s mind, the ones labelled ‘family’ and ‘love’ and ‘home’, shattered. And in their place, a messy, beautiful, chaotic picture was starting to take shape. He risked a glance at Liam, who was watching him, a question in his eyes. Toby gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. *We’re okay.* Liam’s answering smile was a private promise in the middle of the loud, lovely chaos. The hurricane had made landfall, and the house was still standing.The silence that followed Elaine’s tearful pronouncement was broken by the scrape of a chair. Geoff, with the practical air of a man used to managing both engine trouble and his wife’s emotional squalls, pulled a dining chair out from under Toby’s small table. “Well, I’m not standing on ceremony,” he announced to the room at large, settling his large frame into it. “Those scones smell too good to ignore. Elaine, love, park yourself somewhere before you float away.” He gestured with his chin towards the sofa, his tone a perfect blend of fondness and command that gently re-established gravity in the room. His intervention was a masterclass in gentle redirection, and Toby felt a surge of gratitude so profound it almost buckled his knees. Liam, moving with an easy grace that belied the tension of the last few minutes, began to ferry mugs and plates from the kitchen, transforming the coffee table into a makeshift afternoon tea setting.

Elaine, dabbing at her eyes with the sleeve of her brightly patterned cardigan, drifted towards the sofa and sank into it. She did not, however, stop beaming. She watched her son and her stepson move around the small space, her gaze soft and proprietary. It was as if she were watching a film she had personally produced and was delighted to find it had turned out even better than she’d hoped. Toby, acutely aware of her scrutiny, felt a phantom itch between his shoulder blades. He focused on the task at hand: pouring tea into mugs, his movements precise, a small act of familiar order in a world that had tilted off its axis. He handed a mug to his mother, deliberately avoiding her gaze. Liam passed him the milk, their fingers brushing. It was a tiny, insignificant contact, but under Elaine’s watch, it felt as loud as a declaration.

“So,” Geoff said, his mouth full of scone and jam. “Aside from… domestic bliss,” he added with a slight, knowing twinkle in his eye, “what have you been up to, Liam? Found any decent waves?” The conversation was back on safe ground. Liam launched into an animated description of their trip to Bantham, of Toby’s clumsy but valiant attempts to stand on the board, and his eventual, triumphant four-second ride. He told the story with a self-deprecating humour that made Toby the hero of the piece, a brave novice tackling the elements. Toby found himself smiling, the tension in his shoulders easing. He listened to Liam’s voice, a familiar, welcome sound that was now weaving itself into the fabric of his family. He risked a glance at his mother, who was listening, utterly captivated, a half-eaten scone held forgotten in her hand.

It was Toby who, after a suitable interval of cruise-related anecdotes, finally broached the subject that was hovering over them all. “So, where are you staying?” he asked, directing the question to Geoff. “I assume you booked a hotel?” He was trying to sound casual, as if the answer didn’t have profound implications for the population of his flat. “The Grosvenor is usually quite nice.”

“Oh, we’re at a little bed and breakfast on the Hoe,” Elaine chirped. “Just for a couple of nights. We wanted to see you both, and then we thought we’d head up to Geoff’s sister’s in Somerset for a bit.” She looked at Liam. “So we can pick up your things on Sunday, darling, if that suits? Or will you need longer to pack?” The question, though innocently phrased, landed with the weight of an ultimatum. The arrangement was over. The music had stopped. Toby’s stomach clenched. This was the moment. He looked at Liam, who caught his eye, a silent question passing between them. *Your call.* Toby took a breath.

“Actually,” Liam said, leaning back against the sofa cushions with a deliberate, casual ease. “I was thinking of staying on for a bit.” He looked from his father to Elaine. “In Plymouth, I mean. The light here is… interesting. And Toby’s spare room is surprisingly cheap.” He shot a quick, roguish grin at Toby. “And the landlord’s cute, which is a bonus.” Toby’s face erupted in a hot blush, and Elaine let out a delighted gasp. Geoff just chuckled, a low rumble from his chest. “Is that so?” he said, looking at Toby with renewed interest. “Well, you could do worse. He keeps a tidy ship.” The metaphor was so perfectly Geoff that the last of the tension evaporated, replaced by a warm, if slightly awkward, sense of settled fact. The decision had been made, the new reality announced, not with a bang, but with a bad joke and a naval metaphor.

A little later, when the small flat began to feel stuffy with the combined warmth of four bodies and a hot oven, Geoff suggested a walk. “Let’s get some sea air in our lungs before dinner,” he said, hauling himself to his feet. “Show us the sights, Toby.” The suggestion was a welcome reprieve. They walked out into the brisk late afternoon, the wind carrying the briny scent of low tide from the harbour. As they made their way down towards the Barbican, the group naturally separated. Elaine, linking her arm through Toby’s, held him back slightly, while Geoff and Liam strode on ahead, their similar long-legged gaits matching pace on the uneven cobbles.

“So,” Elaine began, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “You have to tell me everything. How on earth did this happen? I thought you’d drive each other mad inside a week.” Toby looked ahead at the two figures silhouetted against the bright grey water of the harbour. Liam had his hands in his pockets, listening as his dad talked, his head inclined. “I don’t know, Mum,” he said, and for the first time, he felt no need to edit his answer for her. “He just sort of… happened. He’s messy and he’s loud and he leaves charcoal dust on everything.” Elaine squeezed his arm. “But?” she prompted gently. Toby smiled, a real, unforced smile. “But the flat was too quiet without him.” He paused, then added the most important part. “I’m happy, Mum. Really happy.” Elaine didn’t say anything, just squeezed his arm again, harder this time. It was enough.

Further ahead, Geoff’s conversation with his son was more direct. “He seems like a good man, that Toby,” he said, his gaze fixed on the trawlers moored in the harbour. “Got a good head on his shoulders. Not your usual type.” Liam kicked at a loose stone. “He’s not a ‘type’, Dad. He’s just… Toby.” “I know,” Geoff said. “That’s what I mean. You’ve not brought anyone home before. Not really.” He glanced at Liam, his expression serious but kind. “This is more than just a place to crash, isn’t it?” Liam looked back towards Toby and his mother, who were now lagging some distance behind. He watched the way Toby walked, carefully navigating the cobbles, and the easy way he was letting Elaine cling to his arm. “Yeah, Dad,” Liam said, his voice quiet but firm. “It is.” Geoff nodded once, a gesture of understanding and acceptance. “Good,” he said. “It’s about time you found a safe harbour.”That evening, they found a pub nestled in the heart of the Barbican, its low-beamed ceiling and dark wood radiating a warmth that pushed back against the damp chill outside. The air was thick with the scent of beer and frying fish, and the cheerful din of Friday night chatter. For Toby, who usually spent his evenings in the curated quiet of his flat, it was a sensory assault. He felt overwhelmed, adrift in a sea of strangers, but then Liam, sitting beside him in the cramped wooden booth, casually rested a hand on his thigh under the table. The touch was a small, secret anchor in the noisy chaos, and Toby found he could breathe again. He was part of a ‘we’ now, a unit of two, and the thought was a surprising fortification.

Elaine, fortified by a large glass of white wine, held court, recounting tales of the Fjords with a theatrical flair that made a minor disagreement over a bingo prize sound like a scene from a Norse saga. Geoff listened with patient indulgence, interjecting only to correct the most egregious factual errors, while Liam played the perfect audience, laughing at all the right moments. Toby watched them all, this loud, vibrant, complicated new family of his, and felt a strange sense of detachment, as if he were observing a chemical reaction he had initiated but didn't fully comprehend. He saw the way Geoff’s gaze would occasionally settle on Liam, a look of deep, quiet pride. He saw the way his mother, even while recounting her adventures, kept glancing at him, her eyes bright with a happiness that was almost fierce. She was looking at him not as her orderly, predictable son, but as a man who had finally done something unexpected, something wonderful.

“Of course, you’ll both have to come for Christmas,” Elaine announced suddenly, her focus snapping back to them with unnerving speed. “We’ll have a proper tree, and Geoff’s sister makes a trifle that would make angels weep. We’ll finally have a real family Christmas!” The future was being laid out, a blueprint drawn up on a napkin, and Toby felt a familiar wave of panic. He didn't do Christmas well; it was too loud, too messy, too full of expectation. He opened his mouth to prevaricate, to offer a non-committal pharmacist’s consultation on the probability of his work rota allowing it, but Liam’s hand squeezed his thigh. “We’ll see, Elaine,” Liam said smoothly, his voice laced with charm. “Depends if Toby has finished alphabetising the tinsel by then. He’s very particular about his festive organisation.” Elaine laughed, delighted, the potential conflict expertly defused. Toby looked at Liam, grateful. They were a team. Liam was his translator, his buffer, his co-conspirator in the wild, foreign land of family relations.

The departure on Sunday morning was less an event and more a slow, cluttered evacuation. Luggage reappeared, blocking the narrow hallway. Elaine issued a dozen last-minute instructions about vitamins, airing the flat, and the correct way to store scones, none of which were directed at the son who had lived alone successfully for a decade. The final farewells happened on the landing, the same place where the invasion had begun. Geoff shook Toby’s hand, then pulled him into a brief, solid hug. “You take care of him,” he said, his voice a low rumble meant only for Toby. It wasn’t a request; it was a passing of the baton. Elaine’s hug was a lingering, tear-dampened affair. “Be happy, my darling,” she whispered, before turning to fuss over Liam one last time. And then, with a final flurry of waves and blown kisses, they were gone, their footsteps clattering down the stairs and fading into silence.

The click of the main door closing downstairs was the loudest sound Toby had ever heard. He and Liam stood on the landing, not moving, listening to the silence reclaim the flat. It was different now. It wasn't the sterile quiet of before, nor the watchful quiet of their early weeks. It was a settled silence, a space that was theirs. Toby turned and walked into the living room, his eyes automatically scanning for mess. A stray napkin on the floor. A smear of jam on the coffee table. He bent to pick up the napkin, a reflex born of years of habit. “Well,” he said, his voice sounding unnaturally loud. “That happened.” Liam followed him in, leaning against the doorframe, a small, knowing smile on his face as he watched Toby’s hands twitch with the urge to tidy. “They’re a force of nature, your mum and my dad,” he said. “A perfect storm of enthusiasm and common sense.” He crossed the room, took the napkin from Toby’s hand, and gently led him towards the sofa. “Stop fussing, pharmacist,” he said softly. “The contamination has been neutralised. You’re safe now.” He pulled Toby down to sit beside him, and the simple act of stopping, of being still, felt monumental. The future was no longer a frantic plan for Christmas; it was just this. A quiet Sunday afternoon, a messy coffee table, and the man beside him. There was no protocol for this, no instruction leaflet. There was only the slow, steady beat of his own heart, finally in time with the world.

The new rhythm of their life began to establish itself in the days that followed. It was a rhythm of comfortable dualities. The quiet mornings of Toby’s early starts against the backdrop of Liam’s slumbering stillness. The creative chaos of Liam’s afternoons, the scent of charcoal and the sound of his jagged guitar music, which now felt less like an intrusion and more like the flat’s own unique heartbeat. The evenings were a shared space, a slow winding down where they would gravitate towards each other, whether cooking in the small kitchen or tangled together on the sofa. Toby learned the landscape of Liam’s moods, the fierce concentration that meant a drawing was going well, the restless pacing that meant an idea was refusing to land. In turn, Liam seemed to learn the subtle frequencies of Toby’s own nature, knowing when his need for quiet was a sign of a stressful day and required a gentle presence, and when it was simply a need for the comfortable silence they now shared so easily.

One drizzly Tuesday afternoon, the bell above the pharmacy door chimed, announcing a customer. Toby looked up from the prescription he was labelling, his standard professional smile ready, and froze. Liam was standing there, dripping slightly onto the pristine linoleum floor, a canvas tote bag slung over his shoulder. His presence was an explosion of colour and life in the monochrome world of antiseptic wipes and beige shelving. He was wearing a paint-splattered jumper and his usual ripped jeans, and he looked utterly, wonderfully out of place. One of Toby’s colleagues, a kindly older woman named Carol, peered over her glasses at Liam with undisguised curiosity. Toby felt a hot flush of something he couldn't immediately name—panic, pride, protectiveness—as Liam sauntered over to the dispensary counter. "Delivery," Liam said, his voice low enough for only Toby to hear, though his grin was for the whole shop. He pulled a slightly squashed-looking sandwich wrapped in greaseproof paper and a flask from his bag. "The artist is providing sustenance for the alchemist. Tuna salad. I remembered you were hovering over it with a fork the day my reign of terror began." The memory, the simple fact that he had noticed and recalled such a small detail from that first day, struck Toby with a force that left him momentarily speechless. He took the sandwich, his fingers brushing Liam's. "Thank you," he managed, his voice a little shaky. "You didn't have to." "I know," Liam said, his blue eyes crinkling at the corners. He glanced around at the towering shelves of neatly ordered boxes, the rows of amber bottles. "Weird seeing you in your natural habitat. It's so… clean." He leaned a little closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You belong in one of my sketches. All black and white and straight lines. But you're better in colour." He winked, then turned and sauntered out, the bell chiming his exit, leaving Toby in a state of stunned, blissful silence, the scent of rain and wet leather lingering in the sterile air. He looked down at the sandwich in his hands, a messy, imperfect, tangible piece of love, and knew, with absolute certainty, that his world of manageable squares was gone for good, replaced by a canvas so vast and vibrant he couldn't see the edges.Carol cornered him by the cough syrups the next day. She was a woman who moved with the slow, deliberate pace of a glacier but possessed the keen, rapid-fire observational skills of a hummingbird. She had been at the Boots on Armada Way for thirty years and had seen everything, a fact she relayed to Toby often. “That was a nice young man who brought you your lunch yesterday,” she said, her voice a conspiratorial whisper, as she ostensibly restocked the Benylin. “He’s got very bright eyes. An artist, is he?” The question was casual, but the look she gave Toby over the top of her spectacles was anything but. In the past, a personal enquiry of this nature would have caused Toby to retreat into a shell of polite, monosyllabic defence. He would have deflected, mumbled something about a step-brother, and fled to the safety of the dispensary. But he looked at Carol’s kindly, wrinkled face, her genuine curiosity, and thought of Liam’s parting words. *You’re better in colour.*

“Yes,” Toby said, and the simple affirmation felt like a small revolution. “He is. His name is Liam.” He found himself smiling, a wide, unguarded smile that made Carol’s own mouth twitch in response. “He’s staying with me. And yes, his eyes are very bright.” The confession, for it still felt like one, left him feeling not exposed, but lighter. Carol just nodded, a satisfied little hum in her throat, and went back to her syrups. She had her answer. The mystery of why their perpetually serious, meticulously ordered head pharmacist had started humming along to the radio and had stopped colour-coding the internal memos had been solved. The black-and-white world of Toby Evans had been subject to a vibrant, and apparently very welcome, splash of paint.

That evening, the flat smelled strongly of linseed oil and something else, a sharp, earthy scent Toby couldn’t place. Liam had, for the first time, set up a proper easel in the corner of the living room, a large canvas propped upon it. He’d covered the surrounding laminate floor with an old dust sheet, a concession to Toby’s sensibilities that was so touching it almost made his chest ache. For days, Liam had been a dervish of creative energy, his sketches becoming more urgent, his gaze more intense. Now, the fruits of that energy were beginning to take shape on the canvas. It was a view of the harbour, but it was a harbour Toby had never seen. The water was a turbulent swirl of deep blues and threatening greys, shot through with aggressive flashes of white. The boats weren't serene vessels at rest, but tense, hunched shapes, their masts like sharp, broken bones against a sky of bruised purple and electric yellow. It was beautiful and violent and utterly captivating. It was Plymouth as Liam saw it: a place of raw, elemental power, not just damp and regret.

Toby stood watching for a long time while Liam worked, his brush moving in a series of stabs and slashes and long, sweeping strokes. He was entirely absorbed, his body a conduit for the image forming on the canvas. Toby felt a profound sense of privilege, being allowed to witness this private, alchemical process. He was seeing the very source of the energy that had so thoroughly upended his life, the engine room of the whirlwind. When Liam finally stepped back, laying his brush down with a sigh, he wasn't triumphant. He looked exhausted, drained. He ran a hand through his hair, leaving a streak of Prussian blue just above his ear, and turned to look at Toby. “What do you think?” he asked, his voice rough. He looked vulnerable, as if he’d just flayed himself open and was asking Toby’s opinion on the arrangement of his internal organs. Toby looked from the turbulent canvas to Liam’s paint-smeared, hopeful face. “I think,” Toby said slowly, choosing his words with the care he usually reserved for potent medications, “that you see the world exactly as it is. Not just the surface of it.” Liam’s tired face broke into a radiant smile. It was, Toby realised, the highest compliment he could possibly have given.

The email arrived on a Saturday. They were having a lazy morning, a rare occasion where Toby didn't have to work and they had no plans other than to exist in the same space. Toby was reading the paper, and Liam was scrolling through his phone, his bare feet propped up on the coffee table, when he suddenly went still. “Oh, wow,” he breathed, his eyes wide. He sat bolt upright, swinging his feet to the floor. “Holy shit.” The sudden jolt of energy made Toby lower his newspaper. “What is it?” Liam looked up from his phone, his face alight with a mixture of shock and pure, unadulterated joy. “The Galiano Prize. It’s a residency. Six weeks. In Lisbon. They want me to submit a full proposal. They saw my Berlin stuff online. This is… this is huge, Toby.” His excitement was a physical force, a bright, crackling current that filled the room. Lisbon. The word landed in Toby’s mind and immediately started to break things. Six weeks. A city of sunlight and colour, a world away from the familiar grey of Plymouth.

A cold, familiar dread began to seep into Toby’s bones, a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant excitement radiating from Liam. He felt his carefully constructed new world, the one filled with colour and comfortable chaos, begin to thin and fray at the edges. His mind, reverting to its old, fearful programming, started doing the terrible maths: six weeks was forty-two days. Forty-two days of silence. Forty-two mornings of waking up alone. He knew what he was supposed to say. He was supposed to share in the joy, to be the supportive partner, to celebrate this incredible, validating opportunity. He opened his mouth, and the correct words were there, waiting to be dispensed. “That’s amazing, Liam,” he said, but his voice was a betrayal. It was flat, lifeless, a hollow echo of the enthusiasm he was trying to project. The bright light in Liam’s face dimmed instantly. He saw it, of course he saw it. He had learned to read Toby’s quiet moods with the same intuition he applied to a landscape. He put his phone down slowly. “You don’t think so,” he stated, his voice losing all its earlier excitement.

“No, of course I do,” Toby insisted, the lie feeling clumsy and false in his mouth. He folded the newspaper, his hands needing something to do, the crisp rustle of the paper a jarring sound in the sudden, heavy silence. “It’s a huge opportunity. It’s Lisbon. You should… you should definitely submit the proposal.” But every word felt like a stone he was forcing himself to swallow. The fear was a taste in the back of his throat, the metallic tang of impending loss. He was a pharmacist who knew that some treatments, while necessary, had devastating side effects, and this felt like one of them. He was terrified that the side effect of Liam’s success would be the end of them. “It’s a long way away,” he added, the small, pathetic truth slipping out from under the weight of the lie.

Liam stared at him, his expression unreadable, the gas-flame blue of his eyes clouded with a hurt Toby had put there. “And that’s it, is it?” he asked, his voice dangerously quiet. “A few hundred miles and we just fall apart? You think this,” he gestured between the two of them, at the messy, happy life they had built in the small, beige flat, “is that fragile?” He stood up and began to pace the small space between the sofa and the window, a caged animal, his restless energy turned inwards, corrosive. “I thought we were past this. I thought you were past this. The idea that anything that doesn’t fit onto your neat little grid is a threat.” The words were sharp, and they hit their mark. Toby flinched as if struck. Because it was true. His old fear, his need for a manageable, predictable world, had resurfaced, ugly and possessive.

He watched Liam pace, his heart aching with a mixture of guilt and terror. He had to fix this. He had to step back into the grey area, the uncomfortable space of emotional honesty. “It’s not you I don’t trust, Liam,” he said, his voice raw. He finally looked up, meeting Liam’s stormy gaze. “It’s me. This is all still… new. Having someone. Being happy like this. The quiet before you came here wasn't peaceful, it was just empty. I’m afraid of it getting empty again.” It was the most vulnerable thing he had ever said, an admission of a fundamental weakness. He was laying his deepest fear out on the table, next to the half-read newspaper and the cooling mugs of tea. Liam stopped pacing. He stood in the middle of the room, looking at Toby, his anger slowly dissolving, replaced by something softer, something that looked painfully like understanding. He had wanted the real Toby, the one beneath the starched white coat and the carefully ordered life, and here he was, messy and afraid.The silence that followed Toby’s confession was profound, a vacuum where the argument had been. Liam stood motionless, the anger draining from him like colour from a photograph left in the sun, leaving behind the pale, stark outlines of the man Toby had nursed through a fever. He crossed the room in two slow strides, his earlier restless energy gone, replaced by a careful, deliberate tenderness. He knelt on the floor in front of Toby, who was still sitting hunched on the sofa, a fortress under siege from his own emotions. Liam didn’t speak. He just rested his hands on Toby’s knees, a gesture of grounding, of anchorage. After a long moment, he looked up, his bright eyes full of a startling, sober clarity.

“You think I don’t know that?” he said, his voice low and raspy. “Toby, I lived in that quiet with you for the first week. It wasn’t just quiet, it was… soundproofed. You’d built walls to keep the world out, but you’d trapped yourself inside. The idea that someone got through, that someone is making noise in there… of course that’s terrifying. It means the walls aren’t as strong as you thought.” He squeezed Toby’s knees gently. “You’re not afraid of the flat being empty again. You’re afraid of how full it is right now. You’re afraid of how much space this takes up. How much it matters.” He wasn't accusing; he was diagnosing, and the diagnosis was so accurate it made Toby’s breath catch in his throat. This artist, this agent of chaos, understood the intricate mechanics of his fear better than he did himself.

Toby could only nod, a helpless, jerky movement. He felt stripped bare, his defences dismantled, not by force, but by a gentle, insistent understanding. Liam shifted, moving to sit on the floor, leaning his back against the sofa next to Toby’s legs, so they were looking at the room from the same low angle. “Lisbon is six weeks,” Liam said, his voice calm and practical, as if he were discussing a grocery list. “Six weeks isn't forever. It's an expiry date. You love those.” A faint smile touched Toby’s lips at that. “We make a plan,” Liam continued, sensing the shift. “Pharmacists love a plan. We set up video calls. You can tell me if the light in my studio is correctly calibrated for optimal creative output. I’ll send you sketches of sad-looking statues. You can come visit for a long weekend. We’ll find a beach and you can show off your four-second wave-riding skills.” He was building a bridge across the chasm of Toby’s fear, using planks of logic and routine. He was speaking Toby’s language.

“You’d want me to?” Toby asked, his voice small. “To come there?”

Liam turned his head, his cheek resting against the sofa cushion, his gaze intense. “Toby, I want you everywhere. That’s the whole damn point. I’m not trying to escape. I’m trying to build something. And sometimes building materials are in another country.” He reached up and took Toby’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “This doesn’t work without you. I go to Lisbon and I paint, and I come home. To you. To this flat. To our messy, stupid, wonderful life. That’s the deal. But you have to trust the deal. You have to trust me.” Toby looked down at their joined hands, Liam’s smudged with faint traces of charcoal, his own clean and pale. They were opposites in every conceivable way, yet they fit. He took a deep, shuddering breath, a man surfacing after being underwater for too long. “Okay,” he said, his voice finally steady. “Okay. A plan.”

The following day, the atmosphere in the flat was one of quiet, focused industry. The argument had cleared the air like a thunderstorm, leaving everything clean and sharply defined. After breakfast, Liam opened his laptop on the coffee table, a blank proposal form glowing on the screen. He stared at it for a few minutes, chewing on his lip ring, before looking over at Toby, who was pretending to read a medical journal. “I suck at these,” Liam admitted. “The ‘artist statement’ part. It’s like trying to explain a colour to a blind person. I just paint the thing. I don’t know how to write about it.” Toby put his journal down. He moved from the armchair to the sofa, sitting next to Liam, peering at the screen. The form was full of boxes demanding explanations of 'praxis', 'artistic intent', and 'projected outcomes'. It was a grid, a system, an attempt to impose order on the chaotic business of creation.

“Let’s just start with what you told me,” Toby suggested. “About the light. About the harbour. Why do you want to paint there?” And so began an unlikely collaboration. Liam talked, his words a passionate, jumbled, and brilliant torrent of ideas about the unique maritime light of a city on the edge of a continent, about the layers of history visible in the architecture, about wanting to capture a place that was both ancient and constantly renewing itself. Toby listened, not just to the words, but to the feeling behind them. He, the man of precision and clarity, became the translator for Liam’s poetic chaos. He’d stop him, ask a question, and rephrase a rambling, beautiful sentence into a concise, powerful statement that fit neatly into the box on the form. “So, what you’re saying is,” Toby would begin, “your work will explore the dialectic between historical decay and modern resilience as manifested in the city’s littoral zones?” Liam would stare at him, baffled and impressed. “Yes! Exactly! How did you do that?” Toby would just shrug, a small smile playing on his lips. He was organising Liam’s energy, not to contain it, but to channel it, to give it the form it needed to be seen by the world.

He felt a profound shift inside him as they worked. He was not just a spectator to Liam’s art anymore; he was a participant, a vital part of the process. He read the words he had helped Liam craft and felt a fierce surge of pride. This was the man he loved, this brilliant, complicated whirlwind of talent, and far from wanting to cage him, Toby found he wanted nothing more than to help him build the key to unlock the next door. The fear of the emptiness Liam’s absence might create was being overwritten by the pride of being part of the reason he was going at all. He realised, with a jolt of clarity that was both humbling and liberating, that his love for Liam was not a fragile thing to be protected from the world, but a robust engine that could help propel him into it. The thought of Liam in Lisbon, painting the very things they were now writing about, no longer felt like a loss. It felt like a shared victory.

By late afternoon, the proposal was complete. They read through it one last time, Liam’s raw, passionate vision articulated with Toby’s quiet, structural strength. It was a perfect synthesis of them both. Liam’s finger hovered over the ‘submit’ button on the screen. He looked at Toby, a silent question in his eyes. It wasn't about the proposal anymore. It was about them. Toby reached out and placed his hand over Liam’s, his fingers covering his knuckles. Together, they pressed down. The page refreshed, displaying a small, neat confirmation: “Your submission has been received.” They stared at the screen, the six weeks in Lisbon no longer a looming threat, but a tangible possibility they had forged together. Liam let out a long, slow breath and closed the laptop. He turned to Toby, his face serious, and gently pulled him into a kiss. It was not a kiss of passion, but of deep and profound gratitude, a seal on a new contract. In the quiet of the messy living room, surrounded by the evidence of their chaotic, beautiful life, Toby finally understood. An adventure wasn’t something that happened to you. It was something you chose. And he had chosen this. He had chosen him.The days that followed the submission of the proposal settled into a new kind of quiet. It was the quiet of a held breath. The laptop, once a focal point of anxiety and creation, sat closed on the coffee table, a silent monolith containing their shared hopes. Life resumed its rhythm, but the underlying tempo had changed. It was a time of waiting, and Toby, a man whose entire profession was built on predictable timelines and dosage intervals, found the uncertainty both unnerving and strangely liberating. There was nothing he could do, no action he could take, but to live in the space between the question and its answer. He found, to his surprise, that he was getting better at it. The waiting was made easier by the simple, grounding presence of Liam, who, having poured all his frantic energy into the proposal, seemed content to simply be. He filled his days with small projects, sketching the shifting patterns of light on the living room wall, re-stringing his battered guitar, and attempting to teach Toby the chaotic art of cooking without a recipe. One evening, this resulted in a curry that was both volcanically hot and breathtakingly delicious, a culinary embodiment of its creator. As Toby sat gulping down milk to quell the fire in his mouth, laughing so hard tears ran down his cheeks, he realised that this—this messy, unpredictable, joyous moment—was the cure for the quiet he had once so feared.

At work, a subtle shift occurred within Toby. The white coat and the dispensary counter no longer felt like a fortress, but more like a vantage point. He saw the tired faces of new mothers picking up colic drops, the anxious fidgeting of men collecting blood pressure medication, the quiet grief in the eyes of a woman whose husband’s repeat prescription was no longer needed. Before, he had seen them as a list of ailments to be solved, problems to be dispensed. Now, filtered through the lens of his own newfound emotional complexity, he saw the stories. He saw the grey areas. One afternoon, an elderly man, a regular named Mr. Henderson, came to collect his wife’s dementia medication. He looked smaller than usual, his shoulders stooped. “She didn’t know who I was this morning, Toby,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, his gaze fixed on a display of corn plasters. “For a whole hour. It’s the not being known that’s the hard part.” The old Toby would have offered a practiced, sympathetic murmur and completed the transaction with efficient pity. The new Toby paused, looked the man in the eye, and said, “I can only imagine how lonely that must feel, Arthur.” The use of his first name, the simple, direct acknowledgement of his pain, made the old man’s eyes well up. It was a tiny moment, a brief connection across the sterile counter, but it felt more significant to Toby than any perfectly executed stock-take ever had. He was no longer just dealing in milligrams and expiry dates; he was dealing in the messy, unquantifiable stuff of life.

Liam’s creative energy, having been so intensely focused, now meandered. He returned to the large canvas of the harbour, but his approach was different. He was less frantic, more contemplative. Some days he would just sit and look at it for an hour, a mug of tea growing cold in his hands. He was waiting, too. Toby would come home from work to find him quiet, a small furrow of anxiety between his brows that he tried to hide with a quick grin. The waiting was a shared burden. One night, Toby found him standing before the canvas in the near-dark, the moonlight from the window silvering the aggressive blues and purples of the painted sea. “What if it’s all crap?” Liam said to the darkness, his voice small. “What if they just laugh?” Toby came and stood beside him, their shoulders touching. He didn’t offer false reassurances or platitudes. He just looked at the painting, at the raw power and emotion Liam had poured onto the canvas. “Then they’re blind,” Toby said simply. Liam was silent for a moment, then he let out a long breath and leaned his head against Toby’s shoulder. The weight of it, the simple trust in the gesture, said more than any words could.

They began to talk about Lisbon as if it were a certainty. It was a way of taming the beast of their anxiety, of making the unknown future a familiar landscape. Liam would scroll through pictures on his phone, showing Toby the steep, narrow streets and the yellow trams. “I’m going to get so lost,” he’d say with glee. “And I’m going to eat a thousand of these,” he’d add, showing Toby a picture of a pastel de nata. Toby, in turn, found himself googling ‘pharmacist jobs in Lisbon’, not with any serious intent, but just to see, to feel the shape of a life that could exist there. He printed out a calendar for the relevant six weeks and stuck it on the fridge, a typically Toby act of trying to impose order on the future. But instead of just seeing a block of empty time, Liam took a charcoal stick and drew a tiny, smiling sun in the first box and a little aeroplane in the last. It became their shared map, a document of hope. They were navigating the waiting together, turning the uncertainty into a collaborative project.

The email arrived on a Tuesday, nearly a month after they had hit ‘submit’. It was raining, a steady, persistent drizzle that blurred the windows and made the world outside feel soft and grey. They were on the sofa, eating pasta from bowls balanced on their knees, watching some forgettable detective show on television. The low hum of the programme, the clink of forks, the patter of rain—it was an evening of perfect, mundane domesticity. Liam’s phone, which was on the coffee table, emitted a soft ping. He ignored it. It pinged again. With a sigh, he leaned forward and picked it up, his thumb swiping across the screen. Toby watched as all the colour drained from Liam’s face. He put the phone down on the table, screen-down, his movements slow and unnaturally deliberate. He picked up his fork and stared at the bowl of pasta in his lap.

Toby’s heart hammered against his ribs. The air in the room felt thick, heavy. He couldn’t breathe. “Liam?” he managed, his voice a croak. Liam didn’t look at him. He methodically twirled some spaghetti around his fork, a pointless, mechanical action. He put the fork in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed. It seemed to take an eternity. Toby felt a cold wave of disappointment wash through him, a preemptive grief for a dream he hadn't even realised he’d been pinning all his hopes on. He was about to reach out, to say “It’s okay,” when Liam finally lifted his head. His face was a mask of careful neutrality, but he couldn't control his eyes. They were shimmering, impossibly bright. He said nothing. He just nodded, a single, sharp, decisive movement.

The nod hung in the air for a second, a silent, seismic event. Then the world came rushing back in. A strangled, half-laugh, half-sob escaped Toby’s lips. He launched himself across the sofa, sending his bowl of pasta tumbling to the floor in a messy heap of tomato sauce and fusilli. He didn’t care. He threw his arms around Liam, burying his face in his neck, feeling the frantic, thrumming pulse against his cheek. “You got it,” he gasped, the words muffled by Liam’s jumper. “You actually got it.” Liam’s arms came around him, holding him tight, and he was laughing now, a wild, incredulous, joyous sound that filled the entire flat. He pulled back, his hands framing Toby’s face, his eyes shining with unshed tears. “*We* got it,” he corrected, his voice thick with emotion. He kissed Toby, a messy, jubilant, pasta-sauce-tinged kiss that tasted of victory and disbelief. For a brilliant, heart-stopping moment, there was only this: pure, unfiltered joy, a feeling so potent and expansive it seemed to lift the roof off the small flat. Then, as he pulled away, still grinning, Toby’s gaze fell on the calendar stuck to the fridge. On the tiny, cheerful sun Liam had drawn. The countdown had begun. The joy didn’t vanish, but it was joined by a new companion, a quiet, bittersweet ache in the centre of his chest. It was the price of admission, the acceptance of the finite. It was the first day of their adventure, and the first day of missing him.The jubilant chaos of the moment eventually subsided, leaving them breathless and grinning in the middle of the living room, a room that now bore the spectacular, abstract splatter of their celebratory dinner. The rich tomato sauce was a lurid slash across the pale laminate flooring, a piece of accidental art Toby would once have attacked with a fury of antibacterial spray. Now, he just looked at it, then at Liam’s face, still bright with triumph, and a fresh wave of laughter bubbled up inside him. This was what happiness looked like. It was messy and inconvenient and utterly perfect. Liam followed his gaze to the floor. “Well,” he said, a grin spreading across his face. “I guess my next project can be a study in pasta-based expressionism.” He didn’t make a move to clean it up, and neither did Toby. Instead, they left it, a gleeful monument to their victory, and made their way to the kitchen to open a bottle of wine Toby had been saving for an occasion he hadn’t been able to imagine. They drank it sitting on the floor, leaning against the kitchen cabinets, their knees touching, talking in low, excited voices about a future that had, an hour ago, been nothing more than a hopeful dream.

The countdown began not with a sense of dread, but with a surprising, shared purpose. The calendar on the fridge, once a source of quiet anxiety for Toby, became their command centre. They crossed off the days together each evening, a small, ritualistic acknowledgement of the dwindling time. It was not a countdown to an ending, but to a beginning. Liam, buoyed by the official validation of his talent, threw himself into his work with a renewed, almost ferocious focus. He had to finish the harbour painting. It had become more than just a canvas; it was his testament to Plymouth, to the turbulent, beautiful period that had transformed him. Toby, in turn, became an active, if unlikely, studio assistant. He learned the difference between sable and hog hair brushes. He found himself on his lunch break not reading medical journals, but researching the best ways to pack a wet oil painting for transport—only to realise, with a pang, that the canvas was far too large to go anywhere.

He broached the subject one evening, as Liam was applying the final, brilliant slash of white to a wave crest. “What are you going to do with it?” Toby asked, his voice carefully neutral. “You can’t exactly take it on the plane as hand luggage.” Liam stepped back from the easel, wiping his hands on a rag, his eyes fixed on his creation. The painting was magnificent. It was all the wildness of the sea, all the brooding energy of a Plymouth sky, captured and held in a frame. It was, Toby thought, a perfect portrait of Liam himself. “I’m not taking it,” Liam said simply. He turned to look at Toby, his expression serious. “It belongs here.” Toby’s breath hitched. “Here?” “In this flat. With you,” Liam clarified. “It was born here. Out of this window. Out of all this.” He gestured around the room, at the beige sofa and the carefully aligned books and the man who had alphabetised his spice rack. “It’s collateral. To make sure I come back for it.” The casualness of the statement belied its immense weight. He wasn't just leaving a painting; he was leaving a piece of his soul in Toby’s care. He was trusting Toby not just with his heart, but with his art, the thing that, until now, had been the most fundamental part of him.

As the departure date loomed closer, the fabric of their life in the flat began to change. Packing boxes appeared, stacked neatly in the spare room—a concession by Liam to Toby’s innate need for order even amidst the chaos of departure. The room, which had transformed from a glorified cupboard to a guest room to Liam’s studio, was now transitioning again, into a space of transit and farewell. Toby would come home and find new items in the boxes: neatly rolled jumpers, a stack of sketchbooks, tubes of paint. Each addition was a small, physical reminder of the impending quiet. The flicker of old anxieties returned, a faint tremor beneath the surface of his new-found confidence. He found himself watching Liam with a kind of desperate attention, trying to memorise the way he chewed on his lip ring when he was thinking, the sound of his laugh, the specific warmth of his hand. But whenever the fear threatened to rise, he would look at the magnificent, turbulent painting that now dominated the living room wall, and the fear would subside. It was a promise. An anchor.

Their last weekend together was marked by a determination to be normal, a quiet rebellion against the drama of the occasion. They didn’t go on a grand, farewell tour of Plymouth’s landmarks. Instead, they spent Saturday afternoon on the sofa, wrapped in a duvet, watching bad disaster movies and eating toast. They walked to the corner shop to buy milk. They bickered playfully over who had to empty the dishwasher. These small acts of domestic intimacy, the mundane bricks and mortar of the life they had built, felt more precious and significant than any grand gesture. It was a quiet confirmation that what they had was real, solid enough to withstand the pressures of distance and time. This wasn’t a holiday romance ending; it was a life being momentarily paused. On Sunday evening, the last night, the flat was tidier than it had been in weeks. The packing was done. Liam’s flight was at ten in the morning. A profound and heavy stillness settled over them. They lay in bed, side-by-side in the darkness, the only light coming from the streetlamp outside, casting long shadows across the ceiling. For a long time, neither of them spoke.

“Are you scared?” Toby whispered into the darkness, the question he had been holding back for weeks. He felt Liam shift beside him, turning to face him. He could just make out the pale gleam of his eyes in the gloom. “Terrified,” Liam admitted, his voice a low murmur. “What if I get there and I can’t paint a single thing? What if I’ve forgotten how? What if all my ideas are gone?” It was the first crack Toby had seen in Liam’s confident facade, a confession of his own deep-seated fear of failure. Toby reached out, his hand finding Liam’s in the space between them. “You won’t,” Toby said, his voice full of a certainty that surprised him. “The ideas aren’t in your head, they’re in how you see. You can’t stop seeing.” He felt Liam’s fingers tighten around his. “What about you?” Liam asked quietly. “Are you scared?” Toby thought of the empty flat, of the silence, of the coming weeks stretching out before him. “Yes,” he admitted, the truth a simple, unadorned fact. “But it’s a different kind of scared now. It feels more like… the moment on the surfboard. Just before the wave lifts you. You don’t know if you’re going to stand up or if you’re going to fall. But you know you have to paddle anyway.” Liam was silent for a moment, then he moved closer, his arm sliding around Toby’s waist, pulling him in until their foreheads were touching. He smelled of soap and sleep and something that was just intrinsically Liam. “Just paddle, Toby,” he whispered. And in the quiet of their last night, surrounded by the ghosts of their future loneliness, they held on to each other, two brave, terrified men, paddling together into the swell.The dawn broke reluctantly, a slow bleed of grey light into the bedroom that felt grudging and mournful. Toby woke before his alarm, his body thrumming with a low-grade anxiety that had settled deep in his bones. He was acutely aware of Liam beside him, a warm, solid presence in the bed, his breathing slow and even in sleep. For a moment, Toby allowed himself to just lie there and watch him, memorising the curve of his shoulder, the way his dark hair fell across the pillow. The impulse was hoarding, a desperate attempt to gather enough sensory data to last. He slipped out of bed with practiced stealth, the floorboards cold under his feet, and went to the kitchen to perform the ritual of making coffee. The familiar motions, the measuring of grounds, the pouring of water, were usually a source of comfort, but this morning they felt like a hollow pantomime. Every action was freighted with the weight of it being the last time for a while.

Liam emerged twenty minutes later, already dressed in jeans and a dark jumper, his rucksack slung over one shoulder. He looked like the man who had first climbed the stairs to the flat, yet he was entirely transformed. His eyes, clear and blue, found Toby’s across the kitchen, and a silent, complicated conversation took place in a single, shared glance. They didn’t speak much. The space for words had shrunk, crowded out by the sheer magnitude of what was happening. They drank their coffee standing up, the silence punctuated only by the hum of the fridge and the distant cry of a gull. Liam checked his pockets for his passport for the third time. Toby asked if he had packed a toothbrush for the second. They were like two actors in a play who had forgotten their lines, falling back on meaningless stage business to fill the void. The taxi was due at eight. At ten to, Liam did a final, slow circuit of the living room, his gaze lingering on the furniture, the books, and finally, the painting.

It dominated the room, a maelstrom of colour and emotion that seemed to hum with a life of its own. It was a piece of Liam’s soul, left tethered to the wall. He reached out and lightly touched the corner of the frame, a gesture of both farewell and ownership. “You’ll look after it for me,” he said. It wasn’t a question. “I’ll dust it every Tuesday,” Toby replied, aiming for a lightness he did not feel. The attempt at humour fell flat, and he felt a lump form in his throat. The buzz of the intercom was a jarring, ugly shriek, a summons from the outside world they could no longer ignore. Their time was up. Toby grabbed his keys, and they descended the stairs together, their shoulders bumping in the narrow stairwell, each small point of contact a tiny, painful farewell.

The drive to Exeter airport passed in a surreal blur. The familiar Devon roads seemed alien, the green hills rolling past the window without registering. Liam put the radio on, a local station playing inoffensive pop songs, and the meaningless cheerfulness was a stark contrast to the thick, anxious silence inside Toby’s sensible Ford Fiesta. Liam didn’t tap on the dashboard this time. He just sat, his hands clasped loosely in his lap, watching the world go by. Toby kept his eyes fixed on the road, his knuckles white on the steering wheel, his mind a frantic loop of “Don’t cry. Don’t make this harder. Be strong.” The airport, when they reached it, was a place of brutal efficiency. The signs for Departures and Arrivals were a stark reminder of their diverging paths. They walked through the automatic doors into the brightly lit concourse, the air humming with the anonymous energy of travel.

They had forty minutes before the flight. Forty minutes that stretched before them like a desert. They found a small cafe and ordered coffees they didn’t want. They sat opposite each other at a small, wobbly table, the space between them feeling like a vast, unbridgeable chasm. Liam kept turning his paper cup around and around on its saucer. Toby found himself meticulously tearing his paper napkin into tiny, uniform strips. All their easy intimacy, their shared language of glances and gestures, had been stripped away by the harsh, public reality of the departure lounge. “You’ll email me the details of your accommodation?” Toby asked, the words sounding stiff and formal. “Yeah, as soon as I’m settled,” Liam replied, his gaze fixed on the departures board, where a flight to Amsterdam was now boarding. “And you’ll send me pictures of the cat from next door. The ginger one. I like him.” “He’s called Marmalade,” Toby said, a watery smile touching his lips. “I’ll tell him you said hello.”

The announcement came too soon, a disembodied female voice calling for passengers for the flight to Lisbon to proceed to gate four. Liam flinched, his head snapping up. This was it. The abstract future had become the immediate, brutal present. They stood up together, abandoning their full cups. The walk to the security entrance was the longest of Toby’s life. They stopped just before the barrier, the point of no return. People flowed around them, a river of humanity parting around their small, still island of farewell. “Well,” Liam said, his voice rough. He slung his rucksack higher on his shoulder. Toby couldn’t speak. He just looked at him, trying to burn the image into his memory: the blue of his eyes, the silver ring in his lip, the streak of paint he’d never quite managed to scrub from his jacket sleeve. Liam reached out, his hands cupping Toby’s face, his thumbs stroking his cheeks. “Hey,” he whispered, his gaze searching Toby’s. “It’s just a residency. It’s not a goodbye.” He leaned in and kissed him, a firm, desperate kiss that was full of all the words they couldn’t say. It was a promise, a prayer, a brand against the coming loneliness.

When he pulled away, he didn't let go immediately. “I love you,” he said, the words quiet but clear, stark and beautiful in the echoing hall. He’d never said them before. The force of them hit Toby like a physical blow, stealing the air from his lungs. Before Toby could find his own voice to reply, Liam squeezed his arms once, turned, and walked away without looking back. Toby stood frozen, his hand pressed to his mouth, watching Liam’s back as he joined the queue, handed over his boarding pass, and disappeared through the security gate. He was gone. The space where he had been was now just empty air. A part of Toby’s brain, the cold, clinical part, registered that a response was now technically impossible. The other, larger part, the part that was now entirely Liam’s, simply ached with the weight of the three words he hadn’t said in return.

The drive home was a numb, automated process. Toby’s body went through the motions of operating the car, but his mind was a million miles away, somewhere over the Bay of Biscay. He didn’t play the radio. The silence in the car was absolute, a heavy blanket that smothered him. He parked in his usual spot, switched off the engine, and just sat there for a full five minutes, staring at the familiar red brick of his building. He felt a profound reluctance to go inside, to face what was waiting for him. It was like a patient hesitating before looking at a bad diagnosis. Eventually, he forced himself out of the car and up the stairs, his footsteps echoing unnaturally in the stairwell. He unlocked the door to the flat and pushed it open.

The silence hit him first. It wasn't the peaceful quiet of his pre-Liam life. It was a charged, ringing silence, defined by the gaping hole that had been torn in it. The air smelled faintly of Liam—of his soap, of turpentine, of him. His dent was still in the sofa cushion. A pair of his socks lay discarded by the armchair. But he was gone. Toby’s gaze was drawn, as if by a magnet, to the living room wall. The painting was there, vibrant and alive, a furious, beautiful storm contained in a rectangle. The blues and purples and greys of the churning sea seemed to pulse with energy, mocking the stillness of the room. It was Liam’s promise, his collateral, his anchor. But as Toby stood before it, tears finally blurring his vision and streaming unchecked down his face, it also felt like a wound. It was the breathtakingly beautiful, exquisitely painful proof of everything he had just lost.The first hour was the worst. It was a physical assault of silence, a pressure in his ears where the hum of another person’s existence used to be. Toby didn't move from the doorway. He just stood there, his keys still clutched in his hand, and let the emptiness of the flat wash over him. His gaze fell on the floor, on the abstract splash of tomato sauce from the previous night, a garish, joyful wound on the clean laminate. He should have cleaned it. He should have been repulsed by the mess, the breach of order. Instead, he felt a desperate, irrational urge to preserve it, to protect this last remaining artefact of pure, unadulterated happiness. He looked from the floor to the wall, where the painting hung, a swirling vortex of colour and feeling. It was so loud, so full of life, that it made the silence around it feel even more profound. The room was a vacuum, and the painting was a window into a storm happening somewhere else, a storm he was no longer a part of. He finally moved, his limbs stiff and heavy, and drifted through the rooms like a ghost in his own home. In the bathroom, Liam’s toothbrush was gone, but the faint, spicy scent of his shower gel lingered in the air. In the bedroom, the indentation of his head was still on the pillow beside Toby’s. He reached out and touched it, the cotton cool against his fingertips. He sank onto the edge of the bed, the mattress barely dipping under his weight, the space beside him feeling vast and desolate. The three words Liam had said, the three words Toby had failed to return, echoed in the crushing silence. *I love you.* They were a gift he had fumbled, a lifeline he hadn't grasped in time.

Sleep, when it finally came late that night, was a thin, restless affair. He woke repeatedly, his hand instinctively reaching for the other side of the bed, only to find the cold, empty expanse of sheet. At some point in the darkest hour before dawn, he gave up, pulling Liam’s pillow into his arms and burying his face in it, inhaling the faint, fading scent of him. It was a desperate, pathetic act, and he knew it, but it was the only comfort he could find. The next morning, he got up, showered, and put on his white pharmacist’s coat. The routine was a life raft in a sea of grief. He made his way to work, the familiar streets of Plymouth looking muted and grey, as if the colour had been leached from the world overnight. The pharmacy was a haven of sterile order, of problems that could be solved with the correct formulation. For the first time since Liam’s arrival, Toby was grateful for it. He needed the rigidity, the clear lines, the lack of ambiguity. He needed to be Pharmacist Toby, the man of systems and logic, because the other Toby, the one who was in love and heartbroken, was threatening to fall apart.

Carol found him in the dispensary, staring blankly at a bottle of Gaviscon. Her approach was gentle. “Long drive back from the airport,” she stated, not a question. Toby just nodded, unable to summon the energy for a proper response. “It’s always quiet, after,” she continued, her voice soft with a wisdom gleaned from decades of watching the small joys and sorrows of the community play out across the counter. “The quiet is the loudest part.” The simple, profound truth of her words broke through his wall of numbness. He had to look away, focusing on the neat rows of boxes, his throat suddenly tight. “Yes,” he managed to whisper. “It is.” Carol patted his arm, a brief, motherly touch. “He’ll be back before you know it. And they have phones now, not like in my day when you had to wait three weeks for an airmail letter that had been half-eaten by a goat somewhere.” Her small attempt at humour was a kindness, and Toby was intensely grateful for it. He gave her a watery, grateful smile. He wasn’t alone in his grief, not really. The world, in its quiet, unassuming way, was making space for it.

He spent the rest of the day on autopilot, his hands performing their familiar tasks while his mind was elsewhere, adrift over Europe. Every ping of the shop bell made his head snap up, a stupid, hopeful reflex. He finally checked his personal phone during his lunch break, his heart performing a painful lurch as he saw the notification. It was a message from Liam. His hands trembled as he opened it. *Landed. Lisbon is a beautiful, noisy mess. The light is insane. My flat is basically a white box with a view of a thousand terracotta roofs. I think I’m going to like it here. Hope the drive home was okay.* It was simple, practical, and it made Toby’s eyes burn. He read it three times, clinging to the mundane details. A white box. Terracotta roofs. He could picture it. He could almost feel the warmth. He sat for a long time, his thumb hovering over the keypad, typing and deleting sentences, trying to find the right words. He wanted to be witty, or reassuring, or poetic. In the end, he threw away all the cleverness and just wrote the truth. *The drive was quiet. The flat is quieter. I’m so glad you got there safely. I love you, too. More than I can say.* He stared at the words, his heart pounding. It was the most terrifying and necessary thing he had ever written. He pressed send before he could lose his nerve, the small swoosh of the message leaving his phone feeling like a final, terrifying exhalation.

The reply came almost instantly, a single word that appeared on his screen and seemed to glow with a light of its own. *Good.* That was all. But it was everything. It was relief and forgiveness and a promise all rolled into one. A sob of pure, unadulterated relief escaped Toby’s lips, and he had to duck his head, hiding his face in his hands until the wave of emotion passed. The grief hadn’t vanished, but its sharp, cruel edges had been blunted. It was no longer a void, but a space filled with a painful, beautiful longing, a space connected by an invisible thread that stretched all the way from a sterile staff room in Plymouth to a white box filled with sunlight in Lisbon. That evening, after work, Toby walked back into his silent flat. It was still quiet, still empty, but it no longer felt hostile. He walked over to the pasta stain on the floor, looked at it for a long moment, then went to the cupboard, got out the cleaning spray and a cloth, and carefully, methodically, wiped it away. He was not erasing the memory. He was making space for new ones.The first week was an exercise in mapping the geography of absence. Toby’s flat, once a single, unified territory, was now divided into zones of varying emotional intensity. There was the side of the bed where Liam wasn’t, a cold expanse that seemed to defy the warmth of the duvet. There was the living room, dominated by the swirling vortex of the painting, a constant, beautiful ache in his peripheral vision. And there was the spare room, now eerily tidy, which held nothing but a faint, lingering scent of charcoal and a few stray packing peanuts. Toby, a man who thrived on order, found himself creating new routines to manage the emotional chaos. Each morning began with two rituals: making a single, perfect cup of coffee, and drawing a neat, black line through another day on the calendar on the fridge. The act was both a measure of endurance and a countdown to reunion, a tiny, tangible assertion of control over the slow, relentless march of time. He kept his promise, dusting the harbour painting every Tuesday, his soft cloth tracing the peaks of impastoed waves. It was a chore that felt like a conversation, a quiet communion with the piece of Liam’s soul that had been left in his care.

Their connection re-established itself across the nine hundred miles, pixel by pixel. The video calls became the new centrepiece of Toby’s evenings. He would arrange his mug of peppermint tea just so, position his laptop on the coffee table, and wait for the screen to resolve into the bright, sun-blasted chaos of Liam’s studio. The contrast was always jarring. Liam’s world was a kinetic explosion of light and sound: the blinding white of the Portuguese sun flooding his room, the clatter and shouts from the street below, the ever-changing landscape of canvases and sketches leaning against the walls. He would be paint-smeared and vibrant, pacing his small space as he talked, gesticulating wildly, showing Toby a new sketch or a startling patch of colour on a fresh canvas. Toby, in his quiet, beige living room, with the soft, grey Plymouth light fading outside, would watch him, a calm anchor in Liam’s creative storm. “Have you eaten anything that wasn’t purchased from a vending machine?” Toby would ask, his practical concern a familiar refrain. Liam would just laugh, a slightly tinny sound through the laptop speakers, and flip the camera to show a half-eaten pastry. “It’s a cultural delicacy,” he’d insist. The slight lag on the connection, the moments where the image would freeze on a half-smile or a frustrated gesture, were a constant, frustrating reminder of the distance, but they made the clear moments, the shared laughter, all the more precious.

Liam began to send him photographs, not of landmarks, but of details. A single, intricately patterned tile, cracked and faded by the sun. The gnarled, twisted trunk of an olive tree in a small square. A close-up of the peeling paint on a fishing boat, revealing layers of blue and green and red like a geological survey of its history. He would send them with no comment, letting the images speak for themselves. Toby would save them to a folder on his phone, a private gallery of Liam’s vision. He found it changing the way he saw his own world. Walking home from work, he started to notice things he had previously ignored: the iridescent shimmer of a puddle of oil on the wet pavement, the complex geometry of a spider’s web beaded with rain in the pharmacy window, the rich, deep green of the moss growing in the cracks between ancient limestone blocks. His city was no longer just a landscape of perpetual damp; it was a place of subtle textures and hidden colours. Liam was teaching him how to see, even from a thousand miles away.

The rhythm they established was comfortable, but fragility lurked at its edges. The first Friday night hit Toby with unexpected force. The pharmacy closed, the weekend stretched before him, a two-day expanse of profound and echoing silence. He walked home through streets filled with people heading out, their laughter and chatter amplifying his own solitude. He let himself into the quiet flat, the silence rushing to meet him like a physical presence. He ate a sandwich for dinner, standing over the sink, unable to bear the thought of sitting at a table set for one. He felt the old, familiar dread begin to coil in his stomach, the fear that the quiet would swallow him whole. On impulse, he called Liam, needing to hear his voice, a lifeline. Liam answered on the third ring, his voice loud and slightly breathless. “Toby! Hey! I can’t really hear you, we’re at this tiny place in Alfama, there’s Fado music, it’s insane!” The background noise was a wall of sound: the melancholy strains of a Portuguese guitar, the clatter of plates, a cacophony of voices and laughter in a language Toby didn’t understand. He felt an immediate, sickening lurch of alienation. Liam was there, in the heart of a vibrant, foreign night, and Toby was here, in his silent, beige flat. “Oh. Sorry to bother you,” Toby said, his own voice sounding thin and small. “It’s fine. I’ll call you later, okay?” Liam shouted over the noise. “Okay,” Toby said, and hung up before Liam could hear the tremor in his voice.

He sat on the sofa, staring at the dark screen of his phone, the ghost of the background noise from the call still echoing in his ears. The old anxieties, the ones he thought he had successfully medicated with trust and communication, came roaring back. He was the quiet port Liam had left, a safe but dull harbour, while Liam was out discovering new, more exciting oceans. He was being ridiculous, he knew, a possessive, insecure fool, but the feeling was potent, a bitter poison seeping into his system. He was halfway to spiralling into a full-blown crisis of confidence when his phone buzzed in his hand an hour later. It was Liam, a video call this time. When Toby answered, Liam’s face was close to the camera, the background now quiet and dark. He was walking, the streetlights of Lisbon gliding past him. “You hung up fast,” he said, his expression concerned. “You sounded like someone had just told you your prescription was going to be delayed.” Toby tried to smile, but it felt weak. “It was just loud,” he prevaricated. Liam stopped walking, leaning against a stone wall. “Bullshit,” he said, his voice soft but firm. “Talk to me, Toby. What’s wrong?” Toby took a breath, the confession catching in his throat. “It’s stupid. It just… you were out, having this amazing time, and I was here, in the quiet. And I felt about a million miles away.” He looked down, ashamed of his own smallness. When he looked up, Liam was just watching him, his expression one of profound tenderness. “Of course you’re a million miles away,” he said gently. “You are. That’s the shitty part. But it doesn’t mean anything. Those people? They’re just noise. You,” he tapped the screen of his phone with his finger, as if he could physically touch Toby’s cheek, “are the signal.”

That conversation became a new anchor point. Liam’s words, ‘You are the signal’, echoed in Toby’s mind, a constant, reassuring hum beneath the surface of his days. The fear of being forgotten, of being a temporary convenience, was replaced by a deeper, more resilient trust. He understood now that their connection wasn't dependent on shared geography, but on a shared intentionality. They were choosing each other, every day, over the distance, over the noise. The realisation was profoundly liberating. Waiting was no longer a passive act of endurance; it was an active expression of faith. The following Saturday, filled with a new and resolute sense of purpose, Toby sat down at his laptop. He went to the calendar on the fridge and looked at the date they had vaguely circled for a potential visit, a long weekend three weeks away. It had felt like a hypothetical, a distant possibility. Now, it felt like a necessity. He opened a new browser tab and typed in the name of an airline. The website loaded, a grid of destinations and dates. He typed ‘Exeter’ into the departure field, and ‘Lisbon’ into the arrival. He selected the dates, his heart beginning to beat a little faster. A list of flights appeared, a series of times and prices, a menu of possibilities. He found one that was perfect: leaving early on a Friday, returning late on a Monday. He clicked on it, his hand steady. He moved through the booking pages, filling in his details with a calm deliberation that felt entirely new. Mr. Tobias Evans. It looked different on a plane ticket confirmation than it did on a prescription label. It looked like a man who was going somewhere. He reached the final page, the total cost displayed in stark, bold numbers, the ‘Confirm and Pay’ button glowing at the bottom of the screen. He thought of the surfboard, the terrifying, exhilarating lift of the wave, and Liam’s voice in his ear: *Go!* He took a breath, and clicked the button. The confirmation page appeared, complete with a booking reference number and a passenger name record. It was a grid, a neat, orderly set of instructions. But this grid wasn’t a cage that kept the world out. It was a bridge that would take him right into the heart of it.Toby kept the confirmation email open in a tab on his browser for the rest of the afternoon, a secret sun warming him from the inside out. He would periodically click back to it, reading the neat grid of his flight details, the string of letters and numbers that formed his booking reference a magical incantation. Mr. Tobias Evans. Passenger. It was a new role, a new identity, and it fit him with a surprising, exhilarating comfort. He felt a quiet, humming power he had never experienced before. It was the power of agency. For years, his life had been a series of careful reactions, of managing and containing the chaos of the outside world. Now, for the first time, he had made a bold, decisive move not in reaction to a problem, but in pursuit of a joy. He had not waited to be invited, or for circumstances to align; he had simply built a bridge and decided to walk across it. He went about the rest of his Saturday with a serene deliberation, tidying the flat not out of anxious compulsion, but with the pleasant sense of preparing a space to be happily abandoned. He felt no need to tell Liam immediately. He wanted to savour the knowledge himself for a little while, to hold this private, glittering thing in his own hands before sharing it.

That evening, when the familiar chime sounded and Liam’s sun-drenched face appeared on the laptop screen, Toby felt a complete absence of his usual long-distance anxiety. Liam launched into a story about a frustrating morning trying to stretch a new canvas, his hands waving in annoyance, his face a pantomime of creative despair. Toby listened patiently, a slow smile spreading across his face, a smile so full of placid joy that Liam eventually trailed off mid-sentence. “What?” Liam asked, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. “You’ve got your ‘I’ve successfully reorganised the paracetamol by manufacturer’ face on. What have you done?” Toby leaned forward, resting his chin on his hands, the picture of calm. “I was just thinking,” he said, his voice even. “I’m going to need your full address. And the name on the buzzer. I wouldn’t want to get lost.” Liam’s brow furrowed in confusion. “My address? Why? Are you sending me a care package of sensible knitwear?” Toby just shook his head, his smile widening. “No. My flight gets in at two-fifteen in the afternoon. On Friday the seventeenth. I just want to make sure the taxi driver can find me.”

The silence that followed was absolute. Liam’s face went completely blank, his brain visibly struggling to process the information. Toby watched as confusion gave way to dawning, incredulous comprehension. The blue eyes widened, the mouth fell slightly open. “You… what?” he breathed. Toby simply held his gaze, his calm unwavering. “I booked a flight,” he said, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. Liam let out a sound that was half a laugh and half a choke. He surged forward, his face filling the screen, his expression one of pure, explosive joy. “You’re coming here? You’re actually coming here? You booked a flight?” He ran a hand through his hair, laughing in disbelief. “Toby, you lunatic! You magnificent, methodical lunatic! You just… booked a flight?” “It seemed the most efficient way to see you,” Toby said, his own composure finally cracking, a laugh bubbling up from his chest. The distance between them, the lag and the pixels, momentarily dissolved, replaced by a shared, brilliant, overwhelming happiness. “My God,” Liam said, his voice thick with emotion, his eyes shining. “I’ve got to clean my flat.”

The next three weeks were a different kind of waiting. The dull ache of absence was replaced by the sharp, pleasant thrum of anticipation. Their video calls, once a lifeline against loneliness, became strategy sessions. They would pore over online maps of Lisbon together, Liam tracing routes with his finger on the screen, showing Toby the twisting streets of the Alfama district, the wide-open expanse of the Praça do Comércio. “We’ll eat here, they have the best grilled sardines,” he’d say, or “You have to see the view from the castle at sunset, it’ll blow your tidy little mind.” Toby, for his part, bought a small Portuguese phrasebook and practiced in the evenings, his careful, precise pronunciation of *“bom dia”* and *“uma cerveja, por favor”* making Liam howl with affectionate laughter. At work, Carol noticed the change immediately. The quiet resignation in Toby’s demeanour was gone, replaced by a barely suppressed energy, a brightness in his eyes that had nothing to do with the pharmacy’s fluorescent lighting. “Someone’s got a spring in his step,” she commented one morning, as Toby hummed along to a song on the radio. Toby just smiled. “The weather forecast is looking good,” was all he said, and she knew he wasn’t talking about Plymouth.

The day of his flight, Toby drove himself to Exeter airport in the quiet, grey light of dawn. The journey was a perfect mirror image of the one he had taken a month before, yet the emotional landscape could not have been more different. There was no dread, no sense of impending loss. Instead, he felt a fizz of nervous excitement, a feeling he dimly remembered from childhood Christmases. He was the one walking through the automatic doors into the departures hall. He was the one checking in his small suitcase. He was the one proceeding through the security gate, placing his laptop in a tray, his small bottle of hand sanitiser in a clear plastic bag. Every mundane step of the process felt significant, a rite of passage. As he sat at the gate, waiting for his flight to be called, he looked out at the planes on the tarmac, sleek, powerful machines designed to defy gravity, and felt a kinship with them. He was also about to defy a kind of gravity, the force of habit and fear that had kept him grounded for so long.

On the plane, he had a window seat. He watched as the aircraft taxied, turned, and then surged forward with a deafening roar, pinning him back in his seat. He felt the thrilling moment of lift-off, the moment the rumbling of the ground gave way to the smooth ascent into the air. They climbed steeply, punching through the thick, sagging canvas of grey cloud that perpetually hung over the South West of England. For a few seconds, they were in a white-out, a disorienting world of pure vapour. Then, with a sudden, breathtaking rush, they burst through the top of the cloud layer and into a world of impossible, brilliant sunshine and endless, piercingly blue sky. The cloud blanket stretched out beneath them like a vast, rumpled quilt, a separate world he had just left behind. Toby stared out at the unbroken horizon, the sheer, clean emptiness of the upper atmosphere, and felt a profound sense of release. He was above the weather. He was finally, truly, above the weather.

Landing in Lisbon was a sensory awakening. The moment the plane doors opened, a wave of warm, fragrant air washed into the cabin, smelling of sun-baked dust, salt, and a faint, floral sweetness he couldn’t name. It was the antithesis of the damp, antiseptic scent of home. Inside the airport, he was enveloped by the sound of a new language, a melodic, flowing river of vowels and soft consonants that was utterly foreign and captivating. He followed the signs for baggage reclaim and arrivals, his small suitcase in hand, his heart beginning to beat a frantic, excited rhythm against his ribs. He felt a flicker of nervousness – what if he couldn’t find him? What if something had happened? But he pushed it down, trusting in the plan, in the promise. He walked through the final set of automatic doors and into the arrivals hall, a bustling, brightly lit space filled with a sea of waiting faces. People holding signs, children clutching balloons, couples ready to embrace. His eyes scanned the crowd, searching for one particular face.

And then he saw him. Liam wasn’t holding a sign. He wasn’t craning his neck or pacing anxiously. He was just there, leaning against a barrier with a kind of relaxed, confident stillness, as if he had been waiting for Toby his whole life. He was wearing a faded t-shirt and had a pair of sunglasses pushed up into his messy hair. He looked golden, vital, a native of the sun. He hadn’t seen Toby yet. He was watching the crowd, a small, impatient smile playing on his lips. Toby stopped, his heart so full it felt like it might burst. He just watched him for a moment, this brilliant, beautiful man who was his. Then Liam’s gaze swept across the crowd one more time and their eyes met. The impatient smile vanished, replaced by a grin of such pure, unadulterated joy that it transformed his entire face, a radiance that outshone the bright Portuguese sun. He pushed himself off the barrier and started walking towards Toby, a slow, deliberate walk that quickly became a near-run. Toby, dropping his bag, met him halfway. They collided in the middle of the crowded arrivals hall, the noise and the people fading away to nothing. Liam’s arms wrapped around him, lifting him off his feet in a hug that was fierce and desperate and possessive. “You’re here,” Liam breathed into his ear, his voice rough with emotion. “You actually came.” Toby buried his face in the familiar curve of Liam’s neck, inhaling the scent of him, a scent of sun and skin and home. He pulled back just enough to look at him, to see the impossible blue of his eyes up close, without a screen between them. “I told you I would,” Toby said, his voice shaky. And then Liam kissed him, right there in the middle of Lisbon airport, a kiss that was not a farewell but a profound and triumphant arrival, erasing every mile of the distance that had separated them.The kiss was a homecoming. When they finally broke apart, breathless, the noisy, indifferent world of the arrivals hall rushed back in, but it was muted, its edges softened by the brilliant, high-definition reality of Liam being right there. Toby could feel the warmth of Liam’s skin, the faint stubble on his jaw, the solid, reassuring pressure of his hands on his back. After weeks of digital approximations, the physical truth of him was an overwhelming, joyful shock to the system. People were staring, Toby was dimly aware of it, but he found he couldn’t bring himself to care. He, Toby Evans, the man who used to find unexpected eye contact in the shampoo aisle a source of mild panic, was the subject of public speculation in a foreign airport, and he felt nothing but a dizzy, radiant happiness. Liam’s grin was so wide it looked like it might split his face in two. He didn’t let go of Toby, but instead tucked him against his side, grabbing his abandoned suitcase from the floor with his free hand, and started steering them towards the exit with a proprietary air. “Come on,” he said, his voice a low, happy rumble next to Toby’s ear. “I want to show you everything.”

The taxi ride into the city was a baptism by light. The sun in Lisbon was a different entity to the pale, watery disc that occasionally visited Plymouth. It was a physical presence, a hot, golden force that bleached the colours of the buildings to pastel shades of ochre, rose, and pale blue, and threw sharp, dramatic shadows across the winding streets. Toby sat with the window down, the warm, fragrant air rushing over his face, feeling utterly dazed. He was a creature of mist and drizzle, suddenly transplanted into a world of brilliant, relentless clarity. Liam didn’t narrate the journey like a tour guide. Instead, he just pointed at things—a flash of intricate blue tiles on a crumbling wall, a tram rattling past, impossibly bright yellow against the sky, a glimpse of the sparkling river between buildings. But mostly, he just watched Toby, his eyes alight with the pleasure of seeing his world through Toby’s astonished gaze. “It’s so… bright,” Toby managed to say, the word wholly inadequate. Liam laughed, a rich, easy sound that Toby felt in his chest. “I told you,” he said, his hand finding Toby’s on the seat between them, his fingers lacing through his. “The light is insane.”

Liam’s building was old, a tall, narrow house with a faded pink facade and wrought-iron balconies, tucked away on a steep, cobbled street. There was no lift. They climbed five flights of winding, worn stone steps, their footsteps echoing in the cool, dim stairwell. With each flight, the sounds of the city grew fainter, replaced by a growing sense of anticipation. Liam pushed open the door at the very top and stood back, a theatrical flourish. “Welcome,” he said, “to the white box.” It was exactly as he’d described it, and yet so much more. The room was stark and simple, the walls painted a brilliant, light-reflecting white. A mattress lay on the floor in one corner, a jumble of clothes in another. But the entire far wall was a series of large, floor-to-ceiling windows, and through them was the view. A breathtaking, chaotic, beautiful panorama of terracotta roofs tumbled down the hillside towards the glittering expanse of the Tagus River, the whole scene shimmering in the afternoon heat. The room was filled, not with furniture, but with Liam’s work. Canvases in various stages of completion were stacked against the walls, their surfaces alive with startling blues and scorching yellows. Sketchbooks lay open on the floor, their pages filled with frantic, expressive drawings. The air smelled of turpentine, oil paint, and the faint, sweet scent of the city drifting in through the open windows. It was a mess. It was a sanctuary. It was the most beautiful place Toby had ever seen.

He walked slowly into the middle of the room, turning in a slow circle, taking it all in. This was the source of the background noise on their calls, the view behind Liam’s head. He had pieced it together from pixels and descriptions, but the reality of it, the scale and the vibrancy, was overwhelming. Liam watched him, his expression a mixture of pride and nervousness, waiting for a verdict. “It’s not tidy,” Toby said finally, his voice soft. Liam’s face fell for a fraction of a second before Toby turned to him, his face breaking into a wide, genuine smile. “It’s perfect.” The relief that washed over Liam’s face was palpable. He closed the door, the sound shutting out the last of the stairwell’s echo, enclosing them in their own private world, a sun-drenched box suspended above the city. He moved into the tiny kitchenette area, filling a kettle. “Coffee? Or something stronger? I think there’s a bottle of Vinho Verde in the fridge that’s probably still good.” Toby didn’t answer. He crossed the room to where a series of charcoal sketches were pinned to the wall. They were the sad-looking statues Liam had promised to find, but they weren’t just sad. In Liam’s bold, dark lines, they were imbued with a profound, weary dignity, their stone faces bearing the weight of centuries. He reached out and touched the rough paper of one of the drawings, a feeling of deep, quiet understanding passing through him. He had missed so much, and yet, in a way, he had been here all along.

Later, as the fierce afternoon sun began to soften and the sky turned a hazy, golden pink, Liam declared it was time for their mission. They walked down through the labyrinthine streets of the Alfama district, the narrow lanes echoing with the sounds of life spilling out from open doorways: the clatter of pots, the murmur of conversations, the distant, melancholy strains of a guitar. The air grew thick with the smell of charcoal and grilling fish. Liam led him to a tiny, unassuming restaurant, a mere hole-in-the-wall with a few rickety tables set out on the cobbled pavement. It was the place he had called from, the source of the noise that had sent Toby into a spiral of loneliness. But being here now, sitting at one of the small tables with a glass of crisp, cold wine in his hand and Liam beside him, the noise was no longer alienating. It was a symphony. It was the lively, joyful soundtrack of a city at ease with itself, and he was a part of it. A man brought them plates of grilled sardines, glistening and perfectly charred, served simply with bread and salad. They ate with their fingers, the food ridiculously, sublimely delicious. Toby watched Liam talk, his hands animated, his face alive in the warm glow of the single lightbulb strung up above them, and felt a sense of rightness so profound it was almost dizzying. He was not a tourist observing a foreign culture; he was simply a man having dinner with the person he loved.

They walked back to the flat slowly, their hands clasped, their shoulders brushing. The city had transformed in the darkness, the streetlights casting long, romantic shadows, the windows of the houses glowing like amber jewels. From the open windows of the Fado bars, the sad, beautiful songs spilled out into the night air. When they reached the top of the five flights of stairs and stepped back into the white box, the view had been reborn. The chaotic tumble of roofs was gone, replaced by a vast, glittering carpet of lights that stretched all the way to the dark, invisible river, a ship gliding across it like a slow-moving star. They stood before the open windows for a long time, not speaking, just breathing in the warm night air and the beauty of it all. Toby felt the last of his old self, the cautious, fearful pharmacist who liked things in their manageable squares, simply fall away, a shed skin left behind in another country. Home, he realised with a startling, simple clarity, was not a grid. It was not his tidy Plymouth flat, or the sterile order of the pharmacy. It was the chaotic, brilliant, beautiful man standing beside him. It was the signal, not the noise. And as Liam’s arm came around his waist, pulling him close, Toby leaned his head on his shoulder and felt the profound, unshakable certainty of being exactly where he was supposed to be.The first morning in Lisbon, Toby woke to the unfamiliar sensation of light. It wasn’t the gentle, apologetic grey of a Plymouth dawn, but a bold, invasive gold that poured through the large, uncurtained windows, painting stripes across the white walls and the tangled sheets on the mattress. He was warm, a deep, bone-deep warmth that had nothing to do with the sun. Liam’s arm was slung across his waist, his leg tangled with Toby’s, their bodies fitted together in the easy, unconscious intimacy of sleep. He lay perfectly still, not wanting to break the spell, and listened to the city waking up below: the distant clang of a tram, the rising murmur of voices, the cry of a vendor selling something he couldn't name. It was a symphony of unfamiliar sounds, yet it felt more peaceful than the profound silence of his own flat had ever been. He turned his head slowly, taking in the sight of Liam’s sleeping face, his features softened, his dark lashes stark against his skin. A feeling of profound, heart-stopping tenderness washed over Toby, so potent it was almost painful. It was a love that felt as bright and boundless as the light filling the room.

Their days fell into a rhythm dictated not by clocks and routines, but by appetite and inclination. They were days of walking, of getting deliberately lost in the winding, cobbled alleyways where laundry fluttered like prayer flags from wrought-iron balconies. Toby, the man who had once navigated his life with the precision of a GPS, found a strange joy in the aimlessness, in turning a corner with no idea of what lay beyond. Liam was the perfect guide, his knowledge of the city impressionistic rather than academic. He navigated by instinct, leading them to hidden courtyards, tiny bars that sold thimble-sized glasses of sour cherry liqueur, and viewpoints that opened up onto breathtaking vistas of the shimmering river. Toby’s old self made a brief, amusing appearance when faced with the city’s public transport map, his pharmacist’s mind immediately trying to systemise the tangled web of tram and metro lines. Liam watched, endlessly amused, as Toby meticulously plotted a route. “Or,” Liam suggested, draping an arm around his shoulder, “we could just get on that yellow one, see where it goes, and get off when we see something interesting.” Toby hesitated for a fraction of a second, the internal conflict between order and chaos a faint, vestigial twitch. Then he folded the map, slipped it into his pocket, and smiled. “Alright,” he said. “Let’s see where it goes.”

They climbed the steep hill to the Castelo de São Jorge in the late afternoon, the sun hammering down on the ancient stones. The heat was immense, but the view from the ramparts was worth every drop of sweat. The whole of Lisbon was spread out at their feet, a breathtaking mosaic of white walls and red roofs cascading down to the vast, blue expanse of the Tagus. The 25 de Abril Bridge, a slash of burnt orange, hung suspended in the hazy distance. They found a spot on a crenellated wall, their legs dangling over the dizzying drop, and shared a bottle of water. Liam was quiet, his sketchbook open on his lap, his eyes narrowed as he took in the panorama, not drawing, but absorbing. Toby sat beside him, feeling the heat of the sun on his face and the solid presence of Liam next to him, and felt a sense of peace so absolute it was like a physical state. This was the view Liam had tried to describe on their calls, but his words had been a pale shadow of this magnificent reality. “I get it now,” Toby said softly, not needing to explain what he meant. Liam turned from the view to look at him, a slow smile spreading across his face. “I knew you would,” he said. He closed his sketchbook, the blank page inside a testament to the fact that some things were too big to be captured immediately. Instead, he took Toby’s hand, his fingers tracing the pale, unfamiliar line of a new sunburn on Toby’s arm. “You look good here,” Liam said, his voice serious. “Like you belong in the sun.”

Art was not forgotten; it was simply integrated into the fabric of their days. Liam’s studio was not a place he retreated to, but a space he invited Toby into. Toby would sit on the floor, reading a book he’d bought at an English-language bookshop, while Liam worked on a new canvas. He learned to distinguish the sharp, clean scent of turpentine from the rich, nutty smell of linseed oil. He learned that Liam hummed, a tuneless, repetitive sound, when he was struggling with a particular colour. He watched as Liam attacked the canvas, his movements a dance of focused energy, and felt not like an observer, but like part of the necessary stillness that allowed the motion to happen. One afternoon, while Toby was concentrating on his book, he slowly became aware of Liam’s silence. He looked up. Liam wasn’t at his easel. He was sitting on a low stool opposite him, a charcoal stick flying across a page in his sketchbook. He was drawing Toby, his brow furrowed in concentration, his head tilted as he captured the fall of the afternoon light across Toby’s face. A self-conscious heat rose in Toby’s cheeks, the same feeling he’d had when Liam had first drawn him in the Plymouth flat. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t a feeling of being exposed, but of being cherished. He didn’t look away. He held the pose, meeting Liam’s intense gaze, and let himself be seen, truly and completely, under the warm, unforgiving light of a Lisbon sun.

On their last evening, they didn’t go out. Liam cooked, a simple, delicious meal of pasta with fresh tomatoes and herbs he’d bought from a market that morning. They ate sitting on the floor by the open windows, the city lights beginning to prick the deep blue of the twilight sky. The four days had passed in a brilliant, sun-drenched flash, yet it felt as though they had lived a lifetime within them. The thought of the flight home the next day was a small, sad note in the background, but it couldn't overwhelm the rich, harmonious chord of the present moment. “So,” Liam said, swirling the last of the wine in his glass. “Was it worth a two-hour flight and a bout of potential sunburn?” Toby looked around the messy, beautiful room, at the canvases alive with colour, at the view of the glittering city, and at the man beside him, his face illuminated by the soft light. He thought of his quiet, beige flat, his orderly shelves, his life of manageable squares. It felt like a photograph of a place he used to live, a lifetime ago. “It was worth everything,” Toby said, his voice full of a quiet, unshakable certainty. He had come here to see Liam, to bridge a gap, but he had found something else entirely. He had found that the adventure wasn’t just in Lisbon, or in Liam. The adventure was in himself, a vast, undiscovered country he was only just beginning to explore. And as Liam leaned in to kiss him, the city sighing its warm, sweet breath around them, Toby knew, with a joy that was as deep and bright as the Tagus at noon, that this was not an escape from his life. It was the moment his life had truly begun.The flight home was a study in inverted perspective. On the way out, Toby had been escaping the grey, flying towards an unknown sun. On the way back, he felt as though he were carrying the sun inside him, a secret, radiant warmth that held the familiar English gloom at bay. As the plane descended, plunging back into the thick, soft blanket of cloud, he did not feel the old sense of oppressive familiarity. Instead, he looked down at the patchwork of damp green fields and the slate-grey rooftops of Plymouth emerging through the mist, and felt a quiet, gentle fondness. This was his home, the backdrop to his life, and he was returning to it not as the man who had left, but as a traveller bringing back treasures from a foreign land: the memory of a shared laugh over grilled fish, the feeling of sun on his skin, the unshakable knowledge that he was loved. This time, the silence in the car on the drive from Exeter was not a heavy, smothering blanket, but a soft, contemplative space. It was filled with the phantom echo of Liam’s voice, the memory of his hand on the gearstick, the soundtrack of their Lisbon adventure playing on a loop in his mind.

He let himself into the flat, his key turning in the lock with a familiar click. He braced himself for the impact of the emptiness, for the cold wave of loneliness he had experienced before. But it didn't come. The silence was there, yes, but it was a peaceful, waiting silence. The air was still, but it held the phantom scent of them, of their last morning together. He dropped his bag by the door and walked directly into the living room, his gaze going immediately to the painting. The turbulent sea, the bruised sky, the furious energy—it no longer looked like a wound. It looked like a heart, powerful and alive, beating at the centre of his home. He smiled at it, a slow, genuine smile, and felt a profound sense of peace settle over him. He was home. Liam’s painting was home. And soon, Liam would be home, too. He went into the bedroom and began to unpack his small suitcase, placing his Portuguese phrasebook on the bedside table and a small, brightly-painted ceramic tile on the windowsill, integrating the bright colours of Lisbon into the quiet landscape of his room.

The remaining three weeks of Liam’s residency passed with a startling swiftness, the days on the calendar falling away like autumn leaves. The dynamic of their calls shifted again. They were no longer just bridging a gap; they were building a future, their conversations filled with the small, practical details of Liam’s return. "I'm shipping two boxes of canvases," Liam announced one night, "so you'll need to be ready to sign for a ridiculous amount of art." Another evening, Toby found himself giving detailed instructions on the best way to clean oil paint off a leather jacket, his pharmacist’s knowledge of solvents finding an unexpected, domestic application. Toby, for his part, found himself changing at a molecular level. At work, he was more present, more patient. He lingered with Mr. Henderson, asking after his wife not out of professional duty but genuine concern. He found himself swapping stories with Carol about holiday disasters and difficult relatives, participating in the messy, human back-and-forth of ordinary life that he had always held at a clinical distance. He was no longer just observing the world from his elevated dispensary; he was down in the aisles, a part of the chaotic, beautiful mess.

The flat itself began to transform under his hands. Fuelled by a nesting instinct he would have found horrifying in his former self, he took on a project. He spent a weekend painting the wall behind the sofa, the one opposite the harbour painting. After much deliberation, he chose a deep, complex shade of blue, a colour that reminded him of the twilight sky over the Tagus. It was a bold, dramatic choice, a world away from the safe beiges and creams of his previous existence. As he rolled the rich colour onto the wall, he felt a thrill of creative satisfaction. He was adding his own colour to the canvas of their home, meeting Liam's vibrant energy with a quiet, confident stroke of his own. When he showed it to Liam on their next video call, Liam was momentarily speechless. "Toby," he said finally, a look of profound, affectionate awe on his face. "You painted a wall. A colour. You are officially a menace." The pride in Liam’s voice was unmistakable.

The day before Liam’s flight home, Toby found himself filled with a humming, restless energy. He cleaned the flat with a joyful, almost manic thoroughness, not to impose order, but to prepare a welcome. He bought fresh flowers, a riot of colourful tulips that he placed in a jug on the coffee table. He went to the supermarket and bought the ingredients for the volcanically hot curry they had once made, and a ridiculous amount of milk, just in case. He looked at the calendar on the fridge. Only one more neat, black line to draw. A whole chapter of their lives, a story of distance and trust and transformation, was contained in that grid of thirty-six crossed-out days. The front door felt like a starting gate. He was waiting for the race to begin, for the sound of a key in the lock that would signal the true start of their life together, not as a temporary arrangement, but as a permanent, breathtaking fact.

Liam’s flight was due to land in the afternoon, and he had insisted on taking a taxi from the airport alone. "I want to walk up those stairs and open that door myself," he had said. "I want to come home." So Toby waited. He sat on the sofa, the newly painted blue wall a calming, deep ocean behind him, the harbour painting a vibrant storm before him. He didn’t read. He didn’t listen to the radio. He just sat in the quiet, peaceful anticipation, every nerve ending alive with the feeling of waiting for a joyful, inevitable event. He heard the taxi pull up outside, the slam of a car door, the familiar heavy tread on the pavement. He heard the main door open and close. And then, the sound he had been waiting for, the sound that had haunted his dreams for six long weeks: footsteps on the stairs. They were slower this time, more deliberate, not the tired, uncertain steps of the stranger who had first arrived, but the steady, confident steps of a man returning to where he belonged. A key slid into the lock. The door swung open. And Liam was there. He looked tired from the flight, but his eyes, those brilliant blue eyes, were full of a light that had nothing to do with the sun. He dropped his bags with a heavy thud, the same sound he had made on his first night. His gaze swept around the room, taking in the blue wall, the flowers, the waiting stillness, and finally settled on Toby. He didn’t smile, not at first. His expression was one of overwhelming, raw emotion, a man who had navigated a long, hard journey and finally reached his destination. “Hi,” he said, his voice thick. “Hi,” Toby breathed back, his heart so full it felt like it might overflow. Liam closed the door behind him, shutting out the rest of the world. He crossed the room in three long strides, closed the remaining distance, and pulled Toby to his feet, his hands tangling in Toby’s hair, his mouth finding his in a kiss that was not a greeting, but a profound and final statement. It was a kiss that said, *I am home.* And as Toby melted into him, all the waiting and the loneliness and the distance dissolved into nothing, leaving only this: the solid, unshakeable, miraculous truth of him, here, in his arms, at last. The grid of Toby’s life was no longer scribbled on; it had been painted over, transformed into a vast, breathtaking, and shared canvas, and its colours were only just beginning to dry.
