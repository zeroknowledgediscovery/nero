The sodium glare of the hospital car park painted everything in a sickly, jaundiced light. It was a light that promised nothing, a tired smear across the damp tarmac. Clara pulled the collar of her coat tighter, the cheap wool scratching at her neck. It was a small, familiar discomfort in a night that felt vast and unnervingly quiet. Twelve hours on the ward. Twelve hours of beeps and sterile smells, of bodies failing and bodies fighting, of the endless, thankless dance with mortality. Now, there was only the squeak of her trainers on the wet ground and the low, distant hum of the city, a beast sleeping fitfully on the horizon. She fumbled in her oversized bag, past a half-eaten apple and a well-thumbed paperback, her fingers searching for the cold, serrated comfort of her car keys.

A skittering sound. To her left, by the overflowing bins that marked the edge of the staff parking. Probably a fox, or one of the monstrous, fearless rats that owned this patch of forgotten land. She kept walking, her pace quickening just a fraction. Don’t be silly, Clara. You’re a nurse. You’ve seen things that would make a grown man weep. A bit of dark and a stray animal shouldn’t unnerve you. But it wasn’t the dark. It was the quality of the silence that followed the skittering. A held breath. A coiled spring. She could feel it on the back of her neck, a prickling sensation that had nothing to do with the damp air or the cheap wool.

He watched from the deep shadows cast by the hospital's incinerator chimney. A splinter of a man, all sharp angles and quick, bird-like movements. To him, she wasn't just a tired woman walking to her car. She was a symphony. The faint scent of antiseptic soap, the soft, rhythmic sigh of her breathing, the gentle sway of her hips beneath the practical coat. It was a song of purest love, a melody composed of compassion and quiet strength. Abhishek felt it resonate deep in his chest, a humming vibration that was both a torment and an ecstasy. This was love. This was the real, uncut, uncorrupted thing. The world was full of a loud, clanging, selfish approximation of it, but here, walking away from a building of pain and healing, was the genuine article. An angel. And he, in his own way, was her most devout worshipper.

His own heart was a frantic, tinny drum against his ribs. He was not a creature of grand gestures. He was a collector of small, perfect moments. Of essences. The world could have her shifts, her fatigue, her fleeting smiles for patients. He only wanted a small, permanent piece. A token of her divinity. A keepsake. He pushed off from the grimy brickwork, his movements soundless, a shadow detaching itself from a larger darkness. He was a goblin, yes, but not of myth. He was a goblin of the forgotten spaces, of the alleyways and the underpasses, of the lonely walks home after the last bus had gone. And he was fuelled by a love so profound, so all-consuming, that it felt like a sickness.

Clara’s fingers finally closed around her keys. A small jolt of relief. The car was only twenty feet away now, its familiar silver shape a beacon in the orange gloom. She risked a glance over her shoulder. Nothing. Just the bins and the chimney and the endless, weeping brick of the hospital's rear facade. She let out a breath she didn't realize she'd been holding, a faint plume of white in the cold air. Silly. Just tired. Her mind was playing tricks. She turned back towards the car, lifting the key, her thumb poised over the unlock button.

That was when the silence broke. It wasn't a shout or a scream. It was a whisper of movement, a displacement of air so close it felt like it came from inside her own head. Before she could turn, a hand, surprisingly strong and cold as stone, clamped over her mouth. Another arm, thin but wiry as a cable, snaked around her waist, pinning her arms to her sides. Panic, stark and absolute, seized her. It was a cold, liquid fire that flooded her veins, short-circuiting thought. Her bag dropped to the ground, the contents spilling with a soft, pathetic clatter. The apple rolled under a nearby car.

He held her close, inhaling her scent—that beautiful, clean, medicinal perfume. The love was almost overwhelming now, a roar in his ears. He was gentle, though. He had to be. This was a sacrament, not a violation. He pressed his face into her hair, murmuring words she couldn’t understand, sounds that were more like coos, like the chittering of some nocturnal creature. Her struggles were a frantic, desperate flutter, the panicked beat of a trapped bird’s wings. He held her fast, his grip unyielding. With his free hand, he reached for hers, the one that had been about to press the button. He ignored the fist she tried to make, his fingers deftly, almost surgically, isolating her thumb. He held it for a moment, this perfect digit. The thumb that checked pulses, that administered injections, that offered a comforting squeeze to a frightened hand. It was the fulcrum of her care, the anchor of her compassion.

He brought a small, dark object up to her hand. She couldn’t see it, could only feel a sharp, metallic coldness against her skin. There was a single, sickeningly efficient *snip*. A sound like a thick carrot being chopped. The pain was not immediate. For a split second, there was only a profound, bewildering sense of disconnect. A numb unreality. Then it arrived. A white-hot, blinding nova of agony that exploded from her hand, travelled up her arm, and detonated behind her eyes. A scream built in her throat, but the cold hand over her mouth smothered it into a choked, guttural gag. The pressure on her waist vanished. He was gone. As suddenly as he had appeared, he had dissolved back into the night. Clara crumpled to the tarmac, clutching her hand to her chest, a keening, animal sound finally escaping her lips. She stared at her own hand, at the grotesque, unbelievable emptiness where her thumb had been. Blood, black in the jaundiced light, pulsed from the wound, spattering the ground where her keys lay, still waiting to be used.

The flat was on the top floor of a condemned tenement block overlooking a shunting yard. The trains shrieked and groaned at all hours, a chorus of tormented metal that suited Abhishek’s temperament perfectly. No one came here. The council had put up boards, but the local youth had torn them down for bonfires, and now the building stood with its windows like vacant eyes, a husk that the city had forgotten it owned. His flat was the only one that showed any sign of life, and even then, only if you knew what to look for: a faint sliver of light under the door, a slightly cleaner patch on the grime-caked window.

Inside, the air was cold. Colder than outside. The only furniture was a stained mattress in one corner and a single, humming chest freezer that stood against the far wall like a squat, white altar. This was his sanctuary. His gallery. He ignored the throbbing in his cheek where Clara’s flailing elbow had connected. A small price. A souvenir of the encounter. He walked directly to the freezer, his movements full of a quiet, reverent purpose. He wiped his hands meticulously on a grey rag before lifting the heavy lid. A cloud of icy vapour billowed out, carrying with it a strange, clinical smell, like a butcher’s shop that only dealt in ice.

Inside, nestled in the frost, were rows of small, clear plastic bags. Each was neatly tied, and each contained a single, severed human thumb. They lay in perfect order, pale and frozen, some slender and elegant, some short and practical. Beside each one, a small, laminated tag was affixed to the plastic with a twist-tie. On each tag, written in tiny, precise script, was a name, a date, and a hospital. *Eleanor. 14th August. St. Jude’s.* *Priya. 2nd September. Royal Infirmary.* *Sophie. 28th October. Hope General.* They were his collection. His catalogue of angels. His love, made tangible and permanent.

He reached into his pocket and retrieved his newest acquisition. Clara's thumb. It was still pliable, the skin soft. He held it up to the weak light of the single bare bulb that hung from the ceiling. A perfect specimen. The nail was neatly trimmed, with just a hint of a pale pink varnish remaining. He could almost feel the phantom warmth of it, the life it had so recently held. A wave of profound satisfaction washed over him. He hadn’t hurt her. Not really. He had liberated a part of her. He had saved it from the endless, grubby decline of the world. Here, it would be preserved. Perfect. Forever. He had a new bag and a new tag ready. He worked with the focused precision of a museum curator, bagging the thumb, labelling it—*Clara. 17th November. City General*—and placing it in the last empty space in the top tray. He adjusted it slightly, making sure it was perfectly aligned with the others. The collection was growing. His love was expanding. He closed the freezer lid, the soft thud echoing in the cold, silent room. He stood there for a long time, one hand resting on the frosted top, his head bowed as if in prayer. The humming of the freezer was the only sound, a low, steady mantra in the heart of the city’s decay.

The Reverend Mabilia Mabie—Mr. Mabie to the few who knew her—stood before the peeling blue door of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and felt a weariness that had little to do with her journey. She had come from the golden domes and sun-baked certainty of Sofia to this: a small, beleaguered church huddled between a betting shop and a launderette, its stone darkened by a century of coal smoke and indifference. Her appointment here, part of a rather ambitious Pan-Orthodox and Anglican fellowship program, had been described as "a challenging mission in a community of great need." Looking at the cracked pavement and the wire-mesh over the stained-glass windows, Mabilia felt that was a remarkably gentle euphemism.

She was a stout woman in her late fifties, with a face that seemed carved from a particularly unyielding piece of wood and hair the colour of iron filings pulled back in a severe bun. She wore practical, dark clothes that gave no concession to fashion or femininity, which, combined with her gruff, accented voice, had earned her the mistaken title "Mr. Mabie" from an elderly parishioner in her first Bulgarian post. The name had stuck, and she had long since stopped correcting it, finding a certain utility in the ambiguity. People tended to underestimate a woman, but they were often uncertain what to make of a ‘Mr.’ who was so plainly not.

Her new home was a cramped vestry that smelled of dust, decaying paper, and a faint, lingering tang of cheap incense. As she unpacked her few belongings—a heavy silver cross, a worn leather-bound copy of the Philokalia, and a framed photograph of the Rila Monastery—she could hear the city outside. It wasn't the boisterous, chaotic symphony of Sofia. It was a lower, more melancholic drone, punctuated by the shriek of sirens and the angry shouts of a distant argument. This place felt spiritually anaemic. As if the very air was thin and lacking in grace. She had felt it the moment she’d stepped off the train at Piccadilly Station. A coldness. A hollow space where faith and hope ought to be.

Her first days were a blur of introductions to the tiny, dwindling congregation. A handful of elderly women who remembered when the pews were full, a young, anxious couple with a new baby, a man who came for the free tea and biscuits and stared at the altar with vacant eyes. They spoke in hushed tones of the neighbourhood's troubles. The drugs, the burglaries, the general air of hopelessness. But they also spoke of something new. A strange and specific fear that had taken root in the community. They called him the ‘Thumb Taker’. The stories were fragmented, whispered things, like a grim urban fairytale. A nurse attacked outside the Royal Infirmary. Another one, weeks later, near Hope General. The details were always the same: a sudden, silent assault in the dark, and a single, bizarre, horrific mutilation. The police were baffled, the newspapers circumspect. It was too strange, too grotesque for easy headlines.

Mr. Mabie listened, her broad face impassive. She had seen evil in many forms. The casual cruelty of bureaucracy, the slow poison of poverty, the loud, strutting evil of political demagogues. But this was different. This felt... ritualistic. It felt personal and impersonal at the same time. It was not born of rage or greed. The descriptions of the attacker were vague—'a small man', 'a shadow', 'quick as a rat'—but the act itself was chillingly precise. It spoke of a purpose, a terrifyingly lucid obsession. That night, as she sat in the cold vestry, the sounds of the city pressing in, she opened her Philokalia. But the words of the Desert Fathers felt distant. She closed the book and simply listened. Not with her ears, but with that other sense, the one she had honed over decades of prayer and introspection. And she felt it again. The cold spot. A void in the spiritual landscape of the city. It was a focused, intentional darkness. It was not a mindless blight; it was a predator. And it was hunting. She placed her work-roughened hands on the cold sill of her window, looking out at the sodium-lit street. Her mission here, she suspected, had just become terrifyingly clear. It was not just to shore up a crumbling parish. It was to face whatever hollow thing was stealing pieces of the city's healers.Chapter 1

Waking up was a slow, sticky process, like pulling oneself from a tar pit. For a disorienting moment, Clara thought she was late for her shift. The light was the familiar, washed-out grey of a hospital morning, the air tasted of disinfectant, and the rhythmic beep of a machine nearby was the metronome to her life. Then she moved, and the white-hot agony in her right hand brought the memory of the car park crashing back in. She wasn't here to work. She was an exhibit. A patient. Her hand was swaddled in a colossal, pristine white bandage, a ridiculous mitten that throbbed with a life of its own. It was propped up on a pillow as if it were a visiting dignitary. The sheer, clinical absurdity of it all made a hysterical laugh bubble in her chest, but it came out as a dry, painful sob.

Her colleagues were her only visitors. They came in pairs, their faces a carefully composed mask of professional sympathy that kept cracking at the edges. They brought grapes and magazines and gentle, useless words. It was Sarah’s visit that broke her. Sarah, who had trained with her, who had held a basin for her on their first day and shared illicit cigarettes on the fire escape during unbearable nights. She didn’t offer platitudes. She just sat on the edge of the bed, looked at the bandaged hand, and her own face crumpled. “The police… they have nothing, do they?” Clara just shook her head, the movement feeling heavy and slow. “We’re all terrified, Clara,” Sarah whispered, her voice tight. “They’re talking about security escorts to the car park, but it just feels… flimsy. He was like a ghost. That’s what you said, isn’t it?” Clara nodded again, not trusting herself to speak. The fear in her friend’s eyes was a mirror, reflecting her own jagged, unending terror. The 'Thumb Taker' had not just taken a piece of her; he had planted something cold and dark in all of them.

After they left, the silence of the private room descended again. It was a different silence from the one in the car park. This one was heavy with unspoken questions and the sterile hum of medical equipment. She stared at the ceiling, trying to banish the images that played on a loop behind her eyes. The feeling of the cold hand. The whisper of movement. The sickening *snip*. She could still feel her thumb. A phantom limb that ached and tingled and tried to curl around the memory of her keys. She would flex her hand, and for a split second her brain would insist it was whole, before the fresh spike of pain from the wound and the dead weight of the bandages corrected it. He had taken her tool, her comfort, her simple, instinctive way of interacting with the world. He had taken the part of her that could open a door, hold a pen, gesture, reassure. He had de-thumbed her, and in doing so, he had unmade her.

Mr. Mabie’s first port of call was not the police station, but the small, perpetually busy newsagent near the church. It was a nexus of local gossip, a place where information was traded with the same weary efficiency as lottery tickets and milk. She bought a copy of the local paper and a bar of plain chocolate, listening as the proprietor, a wiry man with a permanent look of mild alarm, talked to another customer. Their voices were low, discussing the latest attack at City General. They used the name the papers had cautiously avoided: the ‘Thumb Taker’. The name was spoken with a mixture of morbid fascination and genuine fear. Mr. Mabie absorbed the details—a nurse, a car park, the same chillingly specific mutilation. She saw the fear in their eyes, felt the way it curdled the air in the small shop. This was not just a crime; it was a story the community was telling itself, a new monster to populate its already dark woods.

Armed with a name and a location, she took the bus to City General. She didn't go to the entrance buzzing with ambulances and visitors. Instead, she circled the vast, sprawling complex on foot, her stout shoes making a steady, deliberate rhythm on the pavement. She walked past the maternity wing, where new life began with a cry, and the oncology department, where life was measured in cycles of treatment. She passed the A&E, a whirlwind of controlled panic, and the quiet, manicured lawns of the psychiatric unit. The hospital was not a single entity to her; it was a vast, porous membrane between states of being. Between hope and despair, pain and relief, life and death. She felt the sheer psychic weight of the place, the accumulated residue of a million intense emotions. And as she neared the rear of the building, where the service roads and staff car parks were hidden, the cold spot she had sensed in the city’s spiritual atmosphere intensified. It was here. The predator had made its kill here.

She found the hospital chapel tucked away in a basement corridor, a small, windowless room with beige walls and rows of functional chairs. It felt more like a waiting room for a particularly grim appointment than a house of God. An electric candle flickered on a small table next to a stack of interfaith pamphlets. The air was sterile and still, utterly devoid of the thick, prayer-soaked silence of the ancient churches she knew. It was a space designed to offend no one, and as a result, it offered comfort to no one either. Mr. Mabie sat on one of the hard chairs, not to pray for guidance, but to attune herself. She closed her eyes, shutting out the blandness of the room, and focused on the coldness she had followed. It was a sliver of ice in her soul. A presence defined by its absolute lack of warmth, of empathy, of connection. It was a profound and terrifying narcissism, a love that consumed but gave nothing back. It was the spiritual equivalent of a black hole, and its trail, faint but distinct, led away from this place of healing and back into the anonymous heart of the city.Chapter 2

The detective was a man called Fisher, and he looked as tired as Clara felt. His suit was rumpled, his eyes were bagged, and he held his pen like it was a tiresome but necessary burden. He sat by her hospital bed, his notebook open to a clean page that seemed to Clara an insult, a blank canvas on which her trauma was meant to be neatly transcribed. He asked questions she couldn’t answer. What was his height? His weight? His face?

"He was... just angles," she heard herself say, her voice sounding thin and reedy. "And quick. Like a bird, or something folding itself up. I didn't see a face. Just shadows." She focused on a water stain on the ceiling, a pale brown continent in the white sky of the room. "It was the cold. His hands were so, so cold. Like he'd been holding ice."

Fisher sighed, a soft exhalation of professional frustration. "Ms. Hale, we have 'shadow', 'quick', and 'cold hands'. It's not much to go on." He wasn't unkind, but his patience was clearly a finite resource. "The other victims said much the same. It's like we're hunting a ghost." The word hung in the air. A ghost. A goblin. A thing of forgotten spaces. Clara felt a chill that had nothing to do with the room's temperature. She had been touched by something that did not feel entirely of this world, and this man with his notebook and his rumpled suit was trying to catch it with facts.

"I want to go home," she said, the words suddenly solid and definite. The doctor had advised against it, suggesting at least another day for observation, for pain management. But the hospital was no longer a place of healing for her. Every beep of a monitor was the sound of the car park. Every sterile smell was the antiseptic scent on his clothes. The building itself felt like a co-conspirator. Fisher looked up, a flicker of something like pity in his eyes. "We can arrange a police escort to see you home safely." Clara shook her head. She didn't want an escort. She didn't want to be a package to be delivered. She just wanted to be gone. The idea of walking out of the hospital gates was terrifying, but the thought of staying another night was unbearable.

* * *

Abhishek’s day began when the city’s day was ending. He worked as a cleaner for a third-party contractor, assigned to the sprawling, labyrinthine basements of the Royal London Archives. It was the perfect job. He spent his nights in utter solitude, moving through silent corridors and cavernous storage rooms lined with shelves of decaying paper and forgotten history. He was a ghost here, too. A man with a mop and a bucket, utterly invisible, polishing floors that no one but him would ever see. The silence of the archives was a different kind of silence from his flat. It was a heavy, scholarly quiet, thick with the dust of centuries. It calmed the frantic, tinny drumming in his chest.

Tonight, however, was special. It was an audience night. Back in his cold flat, he slid the heavy chest freezer away from the wall. The screech of its feet on the floor was the only sound. He opened the lid, the familiar cloud of cold vapour greeting him like a breath. He did not take out Clara’s thumb—it was too new, too potent, its story still too close to the messy, real world. Instead, his fingers, numb from the cold, found the bag labelled *Priya. 2nd September. Royal Infirmary.* He carried the small, frozen package to the mattress and sat down, holding it in the palm of his hand. He watched as the frost on the plastic slowly melted under the ghost of his body heat, revealing the pale, frozen digit within.

“You were wearing a blue cardigan,” he whispered to the thumb, his voice a soft, reverent hum. “The colour of a summer sky. You laughed with one of the other nurses by the vending machine. A real laugh. Not for a patient, not for show. It was just for you. Pure.” He remembered the moment perfectly. He had been behind a pillar in the main concourse, his own world a grey landscape of routine and observation, and her laugh had been a splash of impossible colour. It was then he knew she was one of them. An angel hiding in plain sight. He held the frozen thumb to his cheek, the intense cold a sharp, clarifying shock against his skin. “I saved that laugh,” he murmured. “It’s in here. It will never fade. It will never be forgotten.” He was not a thief. He was an archivist of a different sort, preserving not paper, but perfection. He was saving these small, divine moments from the relentless erosion of time.

* * *

Mr. Mabie found Priya Sharma’s address in an old parish newsletter from a neighbouring church she’d visited. It listed donors for a bake sale, a small act of community that now served as a map to the city’s pain. The house was a neat, red-brick semi-detached in a quiet cul-de-sac, the kind of street that prided itself on its silence. A woman who was not Priya answered the door, her face guarded and wary. “We’re not interested in any… whatever you’re selling,” she said, already starting to close the door.

“I am not selling. I am a minister,” Mr. Mabie stated, her voice calm and deep. She held up her heavy silver cross, letting it catch the weak afternoon light. “I have come to speak with Priya. About the Royal Infirmary.” The woman’s face tightened. “The police have already been. Many times. She has nothing more to say.” “I am not the police,” Mr. Mabie said, her gaze steady and unblinking. “The police look for a man. I am looking for a sickness. Please.” Perhaps it was the strange authority in her voice, or the sheer, unmoveable solidity of her presence, but the woman hesitated. After a long moment, she opened the door wider.

Priya was in the back garden, a small, meticulously kept square of green, hemmed in by high fences. She was much thinner than her pictures, her movements bird-like and nervous. She flinched when Mr. Mabie approached. “My sister shouldn’t have let you in,” she said, not looking at her, her attention fixed on a wilting rose bush. “I can’t help you.” “I do not need help,” Mr. Mabie replied, stopping a respectful distance away. “I need to understand. When he took you… did he speak?” Priya shuddered, a tremor that ran through her whole body. She shook her head. “No. Not words. Not real words.” “But there was sound?” Mabie pressed gently.

Priya finally turned, her eyes dark with the memory. “It was… a worship. A humming. Like he was… praying.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “He held me so tight. Not like he was angry. Like he was trying to absorb me. And he smelled of soap. Hospital soap. And something else. Old paper. Like a library.” Mr. Mabie’s mind locked onto the details. Worship. Praying. A library. The pieces were beginning to connect, forming a picture more terrible than she had imagined. “One more thing,” she said, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “Did he use a name? For you?” Priya stared at her, her mouth opening and closing silently for a moment before the word came out, a breath of remembered horror. “Angel,” she whispered. “He called me his angel.” Mr. Mabie nodded slowly, her face grim. The sickness had a name. It was a delusion of faith, a perversion of the sacred. The goblin of the forgotten spaces believed himself to be a holy man, performing a sacrament. And a man who believes he is serving God is the most dangerous monster of all.Chapter 2

Getting home was a surrender. Sarah drove her, her chatter filling the car with a brittle brightness that did nothing to keep the shadows at bay. Clara stared out the window, watching the familiar streets of her commute morph into a hostile landscape. Every alleyway held a potential threat, every figure waiting at a bus stop was a silhouette of sharp angles. Her flat, once a refuge from the chaos of the ward, now felt like a cage she was locking herself inside. The front door lock, a simple Yale she had opened ten thousand times without a thought, became her first great challenge. Her left hand, clumsy and unpractised, fumbled with the key, her bandaged right hand a useless, throbbing weight at her side. The simple act of turning the key in the lock took three agonizing attempts, and when the door finally clicked open, the relief was immediately swamped by a new wave of fear. She was inside. She was alone.

The silence in her flat was worse than the silence in the hospital room. It was her silence, a familiar entity that had been corrupted. It was no longer peaceful; it was watchful. Every creak of the floorboards in the flat above, every groan of the building's old pipes, was the whisper of movement behind her. She stood in her small hallway, her hospital bag still at her feet, and surveyed the landscape of her life. The neat stack of mail on the side table, the coat slung over a chair, the half-finished mug of tea from yesterday morning. It all seemed to belong to a different woman, a whole woman. She tried to make a new cup of tea, a ritual that had anchored her through years of stress, but the task was a cruel farce. She couldn't grip the kettle properly with her left hand, slopping water over the counter. The teabag tore, spilling leaves. She finally slumped against the counter, defeated, and stared at her bandaged mitten. The phantom limb was screaming, an insistent ghost trying to pinch, to grip, to exist. She was a nurse. Her hands were her life, her skill, her identity. Now, one was a bludgeon of gauze and pain, and she was adrift.

* * *

Detective Inspector Fisher rubbed his temples, staring at the map on the incident room wall. Three red pins, clustered around three major London hospitals. City General, Royal Infirmary, Hope General. A neat triangle of terror. There was no geographical logic to it, no pattern that suggested a home or workplace. The attacker struck, dissolved, and left nothing behind but a terrified victim and a single, bizarre wound. No DNA, no fibres, no prints, no weapon. Forensics had come up with precisely zero. The press was starting to circle, sniffing the edges of the story, held back only by the sheer weirdness of it all. ‘Thumb Taker’ was the name on the street, but in the papers, it was just the ‘Hospital Attacker’, a name that lacked the chilling specificity of the truth.

“Anything from the vic, guv?” asked a younger detective, hovering by the door with a Styrofoam cup.

“Same as the others,” Fisher grumbled, not looking away from the map. “A shadow. Quick. Cold hands. Feels like we’re trying to put a spook in handcuffs.” He picked up the slim files, one for each victim. Eleanor, Priya, Clara. All nurses. All described as compassionate, dedicated. Good at their jobs. There was no connection between them, other than their profession and their attacker’s apparent admiration for it. It was the lack of animosity that was so disturbing. This wasn't a grudge. It wasn't sexual assault. It was… a collection. The thought made the back of Fisher’s neck crawl. He was hunting a man who didn't hate his victims, but revered them.

His phone buzzed. It was a patrol sergeant from a station near St. Jude’s. “Might be nothing, sir,” the sergeant said, his voice tinny over the line. “But we’ve had a call from a nursing student. She was leaving a late study session at the hospital library. Said a bloke was watching her from across the street. Just standing in a doorway. When she looked at him, he sort of… folded away into the dark. Gave her the creeps. Said he was small, sharp-looking.”

“Did she get a good look at his face?” Fisher asked, sitting up straighter.

“No, sir. Too dark. Said he looked like a ‘splinter of a man’. Her words.”

A splinter of a man. Angles. A shadow. It was the same ephemeral language, but this was different. This was a potential victim who got away. The watcher had been seen *before* an attack. St. Jude’s. Fisher looked at his map. It wasn’t one of the three original locations, but it was another hospital. The hunting ground was expanding. “Get a car down there. Cordon off that doorway. I want forensics to go over every inch of it. Tell them to look for dust,” Fisher said, a strange hunch solidifying in his gut. “Unusual dust.” It was a long shot, a ridiculous shot, but it was all he had.

* * *

Old paper. A library. Mr. Mabie sat in the chilly vestry, a large, modern map of London spread across her small table, its crisp folds at odds with the ancient, dog-eared Philokalia beside it. The police were looking for a man. Mr. Mabie was looking for a habitat. A goblin, she mused, must have its warren. A place of shadow and neglect, a place that smells of decay. Not the decay of flesh, but the slow, dry decay of history. She had dismissed public libraries first. They were too bright, too busy, too full of the living. This creature, this collector, would crave solitude. He would want a place that was already a tomb of sorts.

Her thick finger traced lines across the map, circling the city’s hospitals in red pen. Then, with a blue pen, she began to circle other locations. University archives. Private historical societies. Government record offices. The London Metropolitan Archives. The National Archives at Kew. The British Library’s newspaper collection in Colindale. The map became a web of intersecting possibilities. She was looking for an overlap, a place that offered both proximity to the attacks and the specific environment Priya had described. A place of profound silence and dust.

Her finger stopped. The Royal London Archives. It was a vast, little-known repository, a sprawling Victorian building not far from the river, crammed with civic and legal documents going back to the 17th century. It was not a public-facing institution in the way the British Library was; access was restricted, and its corridors were notoriously labyrinthine and quiet. She drew a line from its location to the Royal Infirmary, where Priya had been attacked. It was a twenty-minute walk. Another line to Hope General was a short tube ride away. City General was further, but still plausible. More importantly, it fit the smell. The smell of centuries of old paper and binding glue. It would be a scent that clung to a person, a scent that someone like Priya, her senses heightened by terror, would register and remember. It was not proof. It was not even a clue a policeman would recognise. It was a confluence. A harmony of place and pathology. Mr. Mabie folded the map. She knew where she had to go next. She would not go to pray. She would go to listen.Chapter 3

The jar of coffee was her nemesis. It sat on the counter, a squat brown cylinder of ordinary life, now an insurmountable obstacle. Clara gripped its base with her left hand, the unfamiliar muscles in her forearm already aching, and tried to twist the lid with the heel of her bandaged right hand. The pain was immediate and sharp, a hot spike that shot up her arm. The jar didn’t budge. A guttural sound of frustration and rage tore from her throat. She wanted to hurl it against the wall, to see it shatter, to match the splintered feeling inside her. But she didn’t have the strength or the coordination. The simple act of making a cup of coffee had become a monument to her own brokenness. Defeated, she slid down the kitchen cabinets to the floor, her good hand covering her face as a dry, hacking sob shook her frame.

Later, driven by a morbid need to confront the reality of her new body, she sat on the edge of her bed and began to slowly, painstakingly, unwrap the bandage. Her left hand was clumsy with the pins and tape. The layers of gauze seemed endless, a white labyrinth she had to navigate to get to the monster at its centre. When the last layer came away, she forced herself to look. It was worse than she had imagined. Not because of the gore—she had seen far worse on the ward—but because it was *her*. Her hand. The stump of her thumb was a neat, puckered horror, stitched closed with black thread like a grotesque seam. It looked alien, a piece of butcher’s meat grafted onto her own skin. The phantom thumb tingled, an infuriating ghost, while the raw reality of the wound pulsed with a dull, heavy ache. This was not a temporary injury. This was a permanent alteration. A re-shaping of her entire existence by a man made of shadows and cold hands. A sudden clatter of the letterbox made her flinch so violently she cried out, scrambling back on the bed, her heart hammering against her ribs. It was only the post. But for a terrifying second, it had been him. He was not just in the car park anymore; he was in every sudden noise, every unexpected shadow. He was a virus in her own home.

Mr. Mabie presented herself at the front desk of the Royal London Archives as a woman with a purpose as dry and dusty as the building itself. She filled out the visitor's form with a steady hand: *Reverend M. Mabie. Purpose of Visit: Research into 19th-century Poor Law parish records*. The title gave her an air of harmless, academic eccentricity. The severe haircut and plain clothes suggested a woman who would cause no trouble. The receptionist, a young man more interested in his phone than the formidable woman before him, waved her through with a bored flick of his wrist. The moment she passed through the security barriers and into the main reading room, the atmosphere changed. The drone of the city was replaced by a profound, weighted silence, the gentle rustle of turning pages the only sign of life. The smell Priya had described was everywhere: the sharp, acidic tang of decaying paper, the sweet, cloying scent of old leather and glue. It was the perfume of oblivion.

She bypassed the main reading room, her instincts pulling her away from the well-lit, populated areas. She walked the public corridors, her stout shoes making no sound on the worn linoleum. She was a ghost in this mausoleum, her senses attuned not to sight or sound, but to the spiritual temperature of the place. She descended a flight of stairs, then another, following the signs for deep storage. The air grew cooler, the smell of dust more intense. Down here, the shelves were packed tight, rows upon rows of grey archival boxes stretching into the gloom, a library of forgotten lives. And here, in the chill of the basement, she felt it. The cold spot. It was like stepping into a pocket of winter air on a summer’s day. A spiritual vacuum. It was not a malevolent presence, but a profound absence, a void where empathy and grace should be. Her skin prickled. The trail led her along a long, poorly-lit service corridor towards a heavy fire door marked 'Contractor Staff Only'. The coldness was strongest here, a residual stain on the very atmosphere. This was his path. This was the goblin’s gate.

Abhishek felt the imbalance. In the cold sanctuary of his flat, he opened the chest freezer and looked upon his collection. The rows of perfect, frozen angels lay in silent testament to his love. Eleanor. Priya. Sophie. And now, Clara. But the top tray was incomplete. There was an empty space beside Clara's thumb, a discordant gap in the harmony. It was a flaw in his perfect archive, a question that demanded an answer. The near-miss at St. Jude’s, the student who had seen him, had not been a failure. It had been an overture. Her fear had been a new and interesting sound, sharp and thrilling. It was not the pure, quiet music of his nurses, but it was a note he now felt compelled to capture and preserve. He closed the freezer, a quiet sense of purpose settling over him.

He moved to his small, makeshift work area. With the same meticulous care he used for his collection, he prepared a new plastic bag. He took out a fresh laminated tag and, with a fine-tipped pen, wrote the name: *Amelia*. He had learned it from her student ID, glimpsed for a second as she’d clutched her books to her chest. *Amelia. St. Jude’s.* The date, he left blank. He placed the empty, prepared bag in his pocket. It felt like a promise. He was not just a collector anymore; he was a curator, bringing order to the chaos of fleeting moments. He was completing a set, finishing a symphony. As he got ready to leave for his shift at the archives, the shriek of a train from the shunting yard below echoed through the condemned building. It was not a noise to him, but a chorus. The sound of heavy things being moved, of powerful forces aligning. He was one of those forces. He was a splinter of a man, yes, but he was driven by a love as vast and as merciless as the city itself. And his love demanded completion.Detective Inspector Fisher looked at the lab report for the third time, a slow grin spreading across his tired face. It was the first piece of good news he’d had in weeks. The 'unusual dust' he’d asked for had paid off. The sweep from the doorway near St. Jude’s contained the expected city grime, but it was also packed with microscopic cellulose fibres, a specific strain of aspergillus mould found on pre-1900s rag paper, and trace elements of a gum arabic-based adhesive. It wasn’t just dust; it was a fingerprint. It was the dust of a specific, controlled environment. It was the dust of an archive.

“Get me a list,” he said to the room at large, his voice buzzing with new energy. “Every major archive, record office, and special collection in a five-mile radius of our three attack sites. Then cross-reference it with their contracted service providers. Specifically, their after-hours cleaning crews. Our ghost has a home, and it’s a bloody library.” The atmosphere in the incident room shifted, the fog of weary frustration lifting to be replaced by the keen, predatory focus of a hunt that finally had a scent. Fisher felt a grim satisfaction. He was going to find this man not by chasing shadows, but by following the trail of a hundred years of decay.

Her plan formed, Mr. Mabie made her way back up from the cold depths of the basement to the main reception desk. She arranged her features into a mask of mild, flustered concern. The young man at the desk barely looked up from his phone as she approached. “Excuse me, so sorry to be a bother,” she began, her Bulgarian accent suddenly a little thicker, a little more the tool of a confused tourist. “I am a little foolish. I believe I have lost an earring. A small, silver one. Not valuable, but of sentimental importance.” She gestured vaguely towards the stairs. “I think perhaps it fell near the lower levels. It is very quiet down there. I was wondering, the person who cleans at night… would it be possible to leave a message for them? To ask them to keep an eye out?”

The receptionist sighed, the effort of engaging with a member of the public a clear burden. He tapped a few keys on his computer. “Night cleaning’s outsourced. A company called ‘Urban Sweep’. Their guy’s name is… Abhishek.” He squinted at the screen. “Just the one name. Starts his shift at seven. I can leave a note in the logbook if you want.” Mr. Mabie beamed, a rare and startling expression on her severe face. “Oh, thank you, you are so very kind. Abhishek. I will remember.” She had it. A name. A single, solitary name, but it was a focal point. It was a hook upon which she could hang the formless dread she had felt in the basement. Abhishek. She turned and walked away, her sturdy shoes making a steady, purposeful rhythm on the floor. Her hunt now had a name.

The flat was a prison of mundane tasks made impossible. Clara tried to eat a slice of toast and jam, but holding the bread steady with her left hand while trying to spread the jam with a knife held awkwardly in the same hand was a lesson in futility. She ended up with more jam on her fingers and the counter than on the toast. The frustration was so potent it tasted metallic in her mouth. She abandoned the attempt, her stomach churning with a mixture of hunger and self-pity. Later, she stood in front of her wardrobe, staring at the row of nurses’ tunics. The familiar blue cotton seemed to mock her. Putting one on would require a series of contortions she couldn’t manage, a two-handed job for a one-handed woman. She was a nurse with no uniform, a healer who could not even feed herself.

The knock on the door sent a jolt of pure adrenaline through her. She froze, her breath catching in her throat. It was a firm, official-sounding knock, not the furtive skittering of her nightmares, but the distinction did little to calm the frantic bird beating in her chest. “Ms. Hale? It’s DI Fisher. Can I have a word?” His voice was muffled but clear. Slowly, like a fawn testing the wind, she crept to the door and peered through the peephole. It was him, his rumpled suit and tired face oddly reassuring in their solid reality. She fumbled with the chain and the deadlock, her left hand shaking, before finally pulling the door open. “We have a lead,” he said, getting straight to the point. “A possible environment. I need to ask you again about the attack. About smells. You said antiseptic, but was there anything else? Anything at all, no matter how small.”

Clara stepped back, letting him into the small hallway. She closed her eyes, forcing herself back to the car park, back into the iron grip of the thin arms. She pushed past the terror and the pain, trying to access the part of her brain that was a trained observer. The cold. The quiet. The cooing sounds. And the scent. Hospital soap, yes, but underneath… “There was something else,” she said, her voice a near-whisper. “It was… dry. A dry smell. Like a museum. Or a very old book. A dusty smell.” Fisher nodded, a flicker of triumph in his eyes. “Dusty,” he repeated. “Thank you, Clara. That’s more help than you can imagine.” For the first time since she had woken up in the hospital, Clara felt a stirring of something other than fear or despair. It was a cold, hard kernel of anger, and with it, a sliver of purpose. She had been a victim. Now, she would be a witness.Chapter 4

The name landed on DI Fisher’s desk with the satisfying thud of a closing door. Urban Sweep. The contractor that handled half the city’s forgotten buildings, from archives to municipal depots. A check of their employee records, hastily emailed from a harassed-sounding HR manager, gave them the rest. Abhishek Kumar. An address in a condemned tenement block overlooking a shunting yard—marked as ‘no fixed abode’ for tax purposes, but the only address on file. No next of kin. No digital footprint. He was a man who existed only on paper, a ghost in the system just as he was a ghost in the car parks. Fisher looked at the map, then at the name. It felt right. The pieces were slotting together with a grim click.

“Right,” Fisher announced to the incident room, the word cutting through the low hum of activity. “We don’t go in loud. This man is a ritualist, a collector. The last thing we want is for him to get spooked and flush his collection down the loo. That’s our only chance at linking him forensically to all the victims.” The plan was twofold. A plainclothes unit would establish surveillance on the tenement block. It was a ruin, a perfect place for a goblin to hide his treasures. The second team, smaller and more discreet, would focus on Amelia, the student from St. Jude’s. “He’s been seen watching her. He’s broken his pattern. She’s no longer just a potential target; she’s his current obsession,” Fisher reasoned, the ethics of the decision weighing on him like a physical cloak. “We use her. We put a whisper-tight shadow on her and we wait for him to come. I want him with the weapon in his hand.” The room was silent for a moment. They were no longer just hunting a man; they were baiting a trap with a living, breathing person.

Mr. Mabie did not have access to police databases, but she had a formidable belief in the fallibility of corporate process and a voice that could convey unshakeable, bureaucratic authority. Posing as ‘Brenda’ from the Royal London Archives’ finance department, she called Urban Sweep. With a torrent of jargon about quarterly invoicing, payroll discrepancies, and data protection compliance, she bewildered the harried office manager into confirming Abhishek Kumar’s home address, ostensibly to send him a new tax form. The address, a tenement on the edge of the city’s industrial zone, confirmed her suspicions. It was a place of decay, a forgotten corner where a sickness like this could fester undisturbed. Her plan was not to confront him there, not yet. A predator’s den was where it was strongest. Instead, she decided to observe his path, to understand the rhythm of his hunt. She took up a position in a darkened doorway across from the Archives' service entrance just before 7pm, her stout form melting into the urban camouflage of the evening rush hour. She waited for the splinter of a man to appear. But seven o’clock came and went. Then seven-thirty. The streetlights finished their stuttering transition to full, harsh sodium glare. The goblin was not coming to his gate. He had broken his routine. He was somewhere else. And that could only mean one thing: he was actively hunting.

The change in routine was a fever in Abhishek’s blood. The quiet, dusty solitude of the archives felt like a distraction, a duty that was keeping him from his true work. He had called in sick, his voice on the phone a convincing croak. His real purpose tonight was Amelia. The nurses were a song of quiet, constant love. Amelia was different. Her fear had been a thrilling, sharp crescendo, a note he had never heard before and now desperately needed to possess. He was near St. Jude’s, a ghost in a different part of the city, learning its new shadows and sightlines. He knew the library schedule, the path she took to the bus stop. He was a student of her habits, a scholar of her movements. He saw her leave, a bright scarf around her neck, her breath pluming in the cold air. She was not alone. Another girl walked with her, their heads close together, their laughter a sound that grated on him. It was a complication. His sacrament was a private, intimate affair. He followed, his soundless footsteps swallowing the distance between them. He was a patient predator, a creature who understood that to capture a perfect moment, one must be willing to wait for the world to provide it.

Clara’s fingers, clumsy and slow, typed the words into the private message box. *He called them his angels*. The thought had surfaced from the swamp of her memory, a detail she hadn't given to Fisher because it had sounded insane, a product of her own shocked mind. But as she sat in the blue light of her laptop, reaching out across the digital void to another person broken by the same shadow, the word felt solid. True. She had sent her first message to Priya’s sister an hour ago, a simple, stark admission of shared trauma. The reply had been almost instantaneous, a torrent of questions, of anger, of a desperate need for corroboration. Now, she offered this piece of the puzzle. She hit send, her left hand aching from the unaccustomed strain. She looked at her bandaged right hand, at the grotesque mitten that hid her new shape. An angel. He had thought her an angel, and he had taken a piece of her as a relic. The idea was so monstrous, so delusional, it should have been laughable. But it wasn’t. It was a key. It was the terrifying logic that held the whole nightmare together. A response flashed onto the screen. It was from Priya’s sister. *Priya said the same thing. She never told the police. She thought they'd think she was crazy. Oh God. Who is this man?* Clara stared at the words. She was not alone in her madness. They were a congregation of unwilling saints, and their shared experience was becoming a scripture, a text that might, if they could read it correctly, finally reveal the face of their terrible god.The trap was set with the mundane patience of all police work. From the cramped confines of a dark blue van smelling of stale coffee and anxiety, two plainclothes officers watched the entrance to the St. Jude’s library. Amelia was their ‘principal’, a walking, talking piece of bait who had no idea she was the most important person in London tonight. She emerged just after nine, a bright pink scarf a beacon in the gloom. “Target is mobile,” the officer in the passenger seat, a young woman named Harris, murmured into her wrist mic. “Heading east on foot. And… we have a plus-one. Another female, similar age.” In the back of the van, another detective watched the feed from a drone hovering silently two hundred feet above, its thermal camera painting the world in ghostly shades of white and grey. They were a net of invisible eyes and ears, cast wide to catch one small, sharp splinter of a man.

Abhishek watched from the recessed doorway of a closed butcher’s shop, the faint, lingering smell of old blood a pleasing incense. The friend was a problem. A loud, laughing problem. His love, his sacrament, was a quiet, private thing. A dialogue between him and his angel, not a public performance. He felt a flicker of irritation, an impure emotion that he quickly suppressed. He was a curator, not a common thug. Patience was his most vital tool. He watched them walk down the main road, their laughter echoing in the cold air. He did not follow directly. Instead, he slipped into a parallel alleyway, his movements fluid and silent, a rat in its run. He knew this territory. He knew the shortcut Amelia sometimes took, a dimly lit lane that cut behind a row of shops. He would wait there, a shadow in waiting, and trust the world to arrange itself for his purpose. The universe, he had found, always rewarded true devotion.

The emptiness at the Archives had been a clear and urgent sign for Mr. Mabie. A shepherd knows when a wolf has left its usual hunting ground to seek a specific lamb. St. Jude’s was the only logical destination. She took the bus, sitting on the lower deck, her large frame a solid, unmoveable island in the flow of late-night travellers. She did not look out the window at the passing city. Instead, she closed her eyes and focused inward, following the thread of coldness that had snagged her attention. It was stronger now, a sharp, focused point of spiritual vacuum. When she disembarked a few blocks from the hospital, the feeling was a palpable chill in the air, a physical presence. Ignoring the bright lights of the main road, she turned instinctively into the quieter, darker side streets. She was a woman of ancient faith in a modern world, but she knew that evil, like water, always seeks the path of least resistance. It flows into the cracks, the forgotten lanes, the spaces between things. And it was in one of those spaces that she could now feel it beginning to pool, a gathering darkness about to overflow.

The digital conversation became a lifeline. In the isolated prison of her flat, Clara found a strange, grim fellowship. She and Priya’s sister, a woman named Anjali, pieced together their shared nightmare, detail by painful detail. *'He didn't speak words,'* Anjali typed, relaying Priya's memories. *'Just sounds. Like he was cooing. It was the most horrible part.'* Clara’s left hand trembled as she typed her reply. *'Yes. And he was so strong. Not big, but wiry. Like steel wire.'* They were building a single, cohesive image from their fragmented trauma. They were no longer two separate victims; they were witnesses to the same terrible ritual. The word ‘angel’ hung between them in the digital space, the key to the entire terrifying delusion. *'The police have a lead,'* Clara typed, a small act of trust. *'Something about dust. From an archive.'* There was a pause on the other end, and then a new message flashed up, so quickly it seemed to be shouted. *'Priya said he smelled of old books. We told the police, but they just wrote it down. They didn't understand!'* Clara stared at the screen. They had both held the same piece of the puzzle, unaware that the other had its mate. A cold anger, clean and sharp, cut through her fear. The police were hunting him with procedure. She and Priya were hunting him with memory.

The moment came, as Abhishek knew it would. Amelia’s friend flagged down a bus, they hugged, and then Amelia was alone. She put in her headphones, the tinny beat of a pop song leaking into the quiet street. She turned into the lane, the shortcut. It was a gift from the universe. His heart began its frantic, tinny drumming against his ribs, a rhythm of ecstatic purpose. He slipped from the doorway, a shadow detaching from a deeper shadow. He was a whisper of movement, a displacement of air. He saw the police van turn the corner at the far end of the lane, its presence as irrelevant to him as a distant star. This moment was his. It was sacred.

Inside the van, Harris swore. “Lost her. A delivery truck just blocked the lane entrance. Where is she?” The drone feed was no help, the narrow lane a black canyon between the thermal blooms of the buildings. Two seconds. Three. Four. A muffled noise. Not a scream, just a choked gasp, almost lost beneath the rumble of the truck pulling away. “Go!” Harris yelled, shoving her door open. “Go, go, go!”

Amelia felt the cold first. A hand, cold as a tombstone, clamping over her mouth, smothering her scream. An arm, impossibly strong, snaked around her waist, pinning her arms. Panic, absolute and blinding, erased the world. He was whispering, cooing words into her hair. The same sounds. The same ritual. His free hand reached for hers, his fingers cool and surgical as he isolated her thumb. He was bringing the small, dark object up—the clippers, the instrument of his sacrament.

That was when the lane was flooded with light. A car’s headlights, not the police van. A taxi, screeching to a halt a few feet away. And from the pavement, a new figure emerged, stepping into the glare. It was a stout woman in dark, severe clothes, her face a mask of grim fury. Mr. Mabie had arrived. She saw not a man and a girl, but a demon and its victim. “Get away from her, you hollow thing!” she roared, her voice not a shout, but a deep, resonant command that seemed to shake the very bricks of the alley. Abhishek froze, his ritual shattered. The unexpected light, the booming voice, the sheer, unmoveable presence of this strange woman—it broke the spell. His perfect moment was corrupted. He shoved Amelia away from him, a snarl of pure frustration twisting his face, and bolted, not back the way he came, but towards the far end of the lane, a scrambling, sharp-angled creature disappearing back into the darkness from which it had come. As police officers swarmed the lane, Mr. Mabie simply stood her ground, her gaze fixed on the dark space where the goblin had vanished. She had not come here as a minister. She had come as an exorcist.The trap was set with the mundane patience of all police work. From the cramped confines of a dark blue van smelling of stale coffee and anxiety, two plainclothes officers watched the entrance to the St. Jude’s library.

Panic, absolute and blinding, erased the world. He was whispering, cooing words into her hair. The same sounds. The same ritual. His free hand reached for hers, his fingers cool and surgical as he isolated her thumb. He was bringing the small, dark object up—the clippers, the instrument of his sacrament.

That was when the lane was flooded with light. Not the police van’s hesitant approach, but a sudden, violent slash of headlights from the street behind them as a taxi screeched to a halt, its driver blasting the horn at the figures blocking the narrow entrance. From the pavement, stepping into the blinding glare, a new figure emerged. It was a stout woman in dark, severe clothes, her face a mask of grim fury. Mr. Mabie had arrived. She saw not a man and a girl, but a demon and its victim, a void feeding on the light. “Get away from her, you hollow thing!” she roared, her voice not a shout, but a deep, resonant command that seemed to shake the very bricks of the alley.

Abhishek froze, his ritual shattered. The unexpected light, the blaring horn, the booming voice, the sheer, unmoveable presence of this strange woman—it broke the spell. His perfect moment, his sacred dialogue, was corrupted by the loud, clanging noise of the world he sought to escape. He saw the police officers now, spilling from their van at the other end of the lane, their faces grim. His love, his ecstasy, curdled into a snarl of pure frustration. He was not a cornered animal; he was a desecrated priest whose altar had been overturned. He shoved Amelia away from him, her body stumbling into the side of a dumpster. He did not run towards the police. He vaulted a low brick wall at the side of the lane, a movement so quick and fluid it was barely human, and disappeared into the labyrinthine darkness of the back gardens beyond.

Harris was the first to reach Amelia, who had collapsed into a sobbing, trembling heap against the grimy brickwork. "He's gone! He went over the wall!" her partner shouted, scrambling in pursuit. The lane was suddenly a chaotic mess of uniformed officers, shouting, and the crackle of radios. DI Fisher arrived moments later, his face a thundercloud of fury and relief. His bait was safe, but his ghost had vanished. His eyes fell on the figure who was not a police officer, the stout woman in black who stood still as a statue, her gaze fixed on the dark space where the attacker had disappeared. "And who the hell are you?" Fisher demanded, his voice raw with adrenaline.

Mr. Mabie turned her head slowly, her iron-grey eyes meeting his. She did not seem intimidated by the chaos or by the angry detective. "I am the one who understands what you are hunting," she said, her voice calm and heavy. "You are looking for a man named Abhishek. But you are chasing a sickness. A hunger for a false divinity." The specificity of the name, spoken with such certainty by this strange woman in the middle of his botched operation, hit Fisher like a physical blow. It was a piece of information she should not, could not, have. The night had just become infinitely more complicated.Chapter 5

The alleyway was a chaotic tableau of flashing blue lights and the urgent crackle of police radios. DI Fisher stood amidst it all, his own internal storm a match for the scene around him. His eyes were locked on the stout woman in black, a figure of unnerving stillness in the swirling vortex of his failed operation. "Let's start again," he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "You're a civilian. You have no official standing. Yet you show up at the precise moment of an attempted abduction, and you know my suspect's first name. I'm going to need a much better explanation than 'a feeling'."

Mr. Mabie met his gaze without a flicker of intimidation. "It was not a feeling, Inspector. It was a diagnosis. One of your victims, Priya Sharma, remembered a smell. The smell of old paper, like a library. I visited the city's archives and felt... a spiritual coldness. A void. I enquired about the cleaning staff." She presented her logic as a simple, linear equation, stripping it of all mysticism. "I learned the night cleaner's name was Abhishek. When I felt that same coldness gathering here tonight, I followed it. You see a criminal, Inspector. I see a theology. A sick and hollow one, but a theology nonetheless. He is not stealing from these women. He believes he is saving a piece of them for eternity."

Fisher stared at her, the anger on his face slowly giving way to a grudging, astonished respect. He was a man of facts, of procedure, of tangible evidence. This woman spoke of spiritual voids and diagnoses, yet her trail had led her to the same place as his expensive drone and team of undercover officers. His gut, a finely-honed instrument of police work, told him she was telling the truth. "Get in the van," he said, the words clipped. It was a breach of every protocol he knew, but this entire case had been a breach of normalcy. He needed to understand what she knew, and he needed to do it away from the prying eyes of his own uniformed officers, who were already staring at the strange woman with open curiosity.

Abhishek ran. His flight was not a panicked scramble but a furious, focused retreat. He moved through the city's hidden veins, the unlit back gardens and narrow service passages that were his natural habitat. He felt the grimy brickwork under his hands, the damp earth under his soft-soled shoes. The city was his accomplice, offering him a thousand ways to disappear. His mind was a maelstrom. The ritual had been violated. The loud, crass intrusion of the horn, the lights, that woman's voice—they had smeared filth all over his perfect, sacred moment. The purity was gone. Rage, an emotion he despised for its clumsiness, burned hot and sour in his throat. He wasn't just fleeing the police; he was fleeing the contamination. He had to get back to his sanctuary. He had to get back to his gallery. The thought of his collection, his rows of perfect, frozen angels, sent a new spike of fear through him. His flat was no longer a refuge; it was a vault that had to be secured, a holy place that the profane world could not be allowed to find.

In her silent flat, Clara felt the shift. It was a quiet click, like a dislocated joint finding its socket. The fear was still there, a constant, low-frequency hum beneath the surface, but it was no longer the only thing. The messages from Anjali, the shared fragments of horror, had built something new: a cold, clear-eyed anger. She stared at the name on the screen—*Priya*—and the word—*angel*. It wasn't a delusion she had suffered alone. It was his pattern. His gospel. She had been a patient, a victim, a collection of symptoms. Now, she felt the old instincts of the nurse returning. Observation. Diagnosis. Action. She picked up her phone, the plastic cool against her skin, and dialled the number DI Fisher had left her. Her left hand, the one that had fumbled with keys and coffee jars, was surprisingly steady. "Inspector," she said when he answered, her voice clear and devoid of the tremor she had expected. "It's Clara Hale. There's something else. Something I didn't tell you because I thought I was imagining it. He called me his angel. I think… I think he calls all of them that."

Fisher was sitting in the back of the van with Mr. Mabie when the call came through. He listened, his eyes widening slightly as Clara spoke. He looked across at the Reverend, who was watching him with her unnervingly perceptive gaze. "She said he calls them his angels," Fisher repeated into the silence of the van after he'd hung up. Mr. Mabie nodded slowly, as if this was the most obvious fact in the world. "Of course he does," she said softly. "He sees their compassion as a form of divinity. And he is their self-appointed high priest." The two disparate threads—the physical evidence of the archives and the psychological profile from the victims—had just been woven together into a single, terrifyingly coherent rope. Fisher keyed his own radio, his voice now stripped of all ambiguity. "All units, we have confirmation of the suspect's address. We're executing the warrant. Now."

The tenement block stood like a rotten tooth against the bruised purple of the night sky. It radiated a profound sense of neglect, its boarded-up windows like cataracts on dead eyes. The police raid was a study in quiet, brutal efficiency. Tactical officers, clad in black, moved like shadows through the derelict courtyard, their weapons held low. There was no sound but the crunch of broken glass under their boots and the distant, mournful shriek of a train from the shunting yard. Fisher and Mr. Mabie waited with the command vehicle, watching the building on a grainy monitor. "You should not be here," Fisher said, more to himself than to her. "No," she replied, her eyes fixed on the screen. "I should."

Inside, on the top floor, Abhishek was trying to restore the sanctity. The world’s noise was a roar in his ears, a violation that had to be purged. He had lifted the lid of the chest freezer, his altar, and the cold vapour swirled around him like holy smoke. He had taken out the top tray, placing it carefully on the stained mattress. His collection. His loves. Eleanor, Priya, Sophie, Clara. He touched each small, frosted bag, murmuring their names, trying to reaffirm the pure, silent connection he had with each of them. He picked up Clara’s. Her thumb, pale and perfect. He had saved her. He had saved them all from the dirt and the decay. He was so lost in his reverie, in his desperate act of reconsecration, that he didn't hear the faint sounds from the stairwell. He didn't hear the whispers, or the soft click of metal.

The first he knew of the intrusion was the sound. Not a knock, not a shout, but an explosive, violent splintering as the battering ram smashed his door off its hinges. In an instant, his cold, silent sanctuary was obliterated by a flood of harsh torchlight, guttural shouts, and the dark, imposing shapes of armed men. He looked up from the frozen thumb in his hand, his eyes wide, his face a mask of utter, uncomprehending violation. His angels, his perfect moments, were illuminated in the profane glare. His temple had been breached.The alleyway was a chaotic tableau of flashing blue lights and the urgent crackle of police radios. DI Fisher stood amidst it all, his own internal storm a match for the scene around him. His eyes were locked on the stout woman in black, a figure of unnerving stillness in the swirling vortex of his failed operation. "Let's start again," he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "You're a civilian. You have no official standing. Yet you show up at the precise moment of an attempted abduction, and you know my suspect's first name. I'm going to need a much better explanation than 'a feeling'."

Mr. Mabie met his gaze without a flicker of intimidation. "It was not a feeling, Inspector. It was a diagnosis. One of your victims, Priya Sharma, remembered a smell. The smell of old paper, like a library. I visited the city's archives and felt... a spiritual coldness. A void. I enquired about the cleaning staff." She presented her logic as a simple, linear equation, stripping it of all mysticism. "I learned the night cleaner's name was Abhishek. When I felt that same coldness gathering here tonight, I followed it. You see a criminal, Inspector. I see a theology. A sick and hollow one, but a theology nonetheless. He is not stealing from these women. He believes he is saving a piece of them for eternity."

Fisher stared at her, the anger on his face slowly giving way to a grudging, astonished respect. He was a man of facts, of procedure, of tangible evidence. This woman spoke of spiritual voids and diagnoses, yet her trail had led her to the same place as his expensive drone and team of undercover officers. His gut, a finely-honed instrument of police work, told him she was telling the truth. "Get in the van," he said, the words clipped. It was a breach of every protocol he knew, but this entire case had been a breach of normalcy. He needed to understand what she knew, and he needed to do it away from the prying eyes of his own uniformed officers, who were already staring at the strange woman with open curiosity.

In an instant, his cold, silent sanctuary was obliterated by a flood of harsh torchlight, guttural shouts, and the dark, imposing shapes of armed men. He looked up from the frozen thumb in his hand, his eyes wide, his face a mask of utter, uncomprehending violation. His angels, his perfect moments, were illuminated in the profane glare. His temple had been breached. The splinter of a man did not cower or snarl. He reacted with the frantic, protective terror of a priest whose holiest relic is about to be desecrated. A wounded, guttural cry escaped his lips, a sound of pure anguish, and he threw his body over the tray on the mattress, shielding his frozen angels with his own thin frame. "No," he whimpered, the word a pathetic prayer against the overwhelming force of the world. "No, you can't touch them. They're perfect."

The tactical officers were professionals. They saw a suspect, a weapon—the small, dark shape of the clippers on the floor—and a potential biohazard. They subdued him with swift, impersonal force, pulling him away from the mattress, his struggles weak and desperate. He wasn't fighting them; he was trying to get back to his collection, his arms reaching, his fingers grasping at the air as if to physically pull the sacred silence back over the scene. Fisher and Mr. Mabie entered seconds later, stepping into a room that was cold enough to make their breath mist. The air was thick with the hum of the freezer and the smell of old filth. Fisher's gaze went straight to the chest freezer, squat and white like a tomb, its lid still open. Then to the mattress, where the tray lay exposed under the harsh beam of an officer's torch.

Mr. Mabie stopped just inside the doorway, her hand instinctively clutching the silver cross at her neck. She had felt the spiritual void, diagnosed the sickness, and followed the trail. But to see the physical manifestation of the delusion laid out so clinically was a different kind of horror. It was a reliquary of madness. Each small, frosted bag was a stolen story, a captured moment of grace twisted into a grotesque keepsake. The neatly written tags were the most chilling part, a catalogue of profanity masquerading as devotion. She looked at Abhishek, now pinned against the wall, his face streaked with tears, his eyes fixed on the tray with an expression of heartbreaking, psychotic love. He was not a monster. He was a vacuum that had tried to fill itself with pieces of other people's souls.

Fisher walked slowly towards the freezer, his own face a grim mask. He crouched down, peering inside. More rows. More neat little bags, more laminated tags. A cold, methodical library of human parts. He felt a wave of nausea, which he suppressed with professional discipline. "Get forensics in here now," he commanded, his voice tight. "This is the primary crime scene. I want every speck of dust, every fibre. Bag the whole damn freezer if you have to." He stood up and turned to the whimpering man being held by his officers. For a moment, he wanted to rage at him, to demand to know why. But looking at Abhishek's face, at the profound, unshakeable conviction in his desolate eyes, he knew that any question would be pointless. It would be like asking a zealot to explain the logic of God.

The phone call came just after midnight. Clara was sitting in the dark, the blue light of her laptop the only illumination, the chat window with Anjali still open. When her phone rang, her whole body jumped. She saw Fisher's name on the screen and answered with a hand that had started to tremble again. "We got him, Clara," he said, his voice weary but definite. "It's over. We have him in custody." A wave of relief so profound it was dizzying washed over her, making her gasp. It was a physical release, as if a spring coiled tight in her chest for weeks had finally snapped. "Thank you," she whispered, tears she hadn't realised were there starting to roll down her cheeks. "Oh God, thank you."

"Clara," Fisher said, his tone shifting, becoming more gentle, more hesitant. "There's something else. We found... he was a collector. We found your..." He trailed off, unable to say the word. But he didn't need to. Clara understood instantly. A collector. The word landed with the force of a physical blow. She wasn't just a random victim. She was an acquisition. An exhibit. Her hand, the real one, the one that still throbbed with a phantom ache, was in a bag, labelled, in a freezer somewhere. The relief of a moment ago curdled into a new, more complex horror. The violation wasn't just in the act; it was in the preservation. He hadn't just taken a piece of her; he had curated it. The keening, animal sound she had made in the car park rose in her throat again, a raw sound of absolute violation, as the true, horrifying scope of the goblin's love was finally made clear.Chapter 6

The phone slipped from Clara’s left hand, clattering onto the wooden floor. She didn't bend to pick it up. She sat frozen in her chair, the silence of the flat roaring back in to fill the space where DI Fisher's voice had been. It’s over. The words meant nothing. Over was a closed door, a finished book. This was a room whose walls had just dissolved, revealing a new and far more terrifying landscape. A collector. The word was a parasite, burrowing into her mind. He hadn’t just attacked her; he had curated her. Her pain, her terror, her disfigurement—it was all just part of his acquisition process. The grotesque stump of her thumb, hidden beneath its white cocoon of gauze, began to throb with a new kind of agony. It was no longer just a wound. It was an absence that had a presence somewhere else. A piece of her was logged in an evidence locker, cold and tagged, a specimen in the museum of his madness. The thought was a violation far deeper than the physical assault, a psychological stain that felt impossible to wash away. He hadn't just taken a part of her body; he had taken a part of her story and filed it away in his own perverse archive.

The interview room was a grey, soundless box. Abhishek sat on one side of the thin metal table, not in defiance, but in a state of near-total collapse. He was folded in on himself, a collection of sharp angles and silent misery. DI Fisher sat opposite, the case file open before him, though he barely glanced at it. He had the evidence, the location, the weapon, the victims. All he needed now was the confession, the neat tying-off of the narrative for the Crown Prosecution Service. He started with the formalities, name, address, caution. Abhishek nodded dumbly, his eyes vacant. It was only when Fisher slid a series of glossy photographs across the table—stark, clinical shots of the chest freezer and its contents—that a flicker of life returned.

Abhishek didn't recoil in horror or shame. He reached out with a trembling hand, his fingers hovering over a photo of the tray from the mattress. "Are they safe?" he whispered, his voice a dry rasp. "Are you keeping them cold?" Fisher stared at him, momentarily speechless. Of all the reactions he had anticipated, solicitous concern for the evidence was not one of them. "They are evidence in a criminal investigation, Mr. Kumar," Fisher said, his voice flat and hard. Abhishek flinched at the name, as if it were an insult. "No," he said, shaking his head, a desperate clarity entering his eyes. "They are not evidence. They are... love. Made permanent. You don't understand. The world uses them up. It makes them tired and old. Their compassion... it fades. I was saving it. I was saving the best part." He looked directly at Fisher then, his gaze pleading, frantic. "The freezers have a specific temperature setting. It must be maintained. You have to promise me. You have to promise me you will take care of my angels."

Leaving the interview room felt like surfacing from a deep, cold body of water. Fisher loosened his tie, the air in the corridor feeling blessedly normal, sane. He saw Mr. Mabie waiting for him on a hard plastic chair at the end of the hall, her hands resting on her knees, as if she had known he would need to talk. He walked towards her, running a hand through his already dishevelled hair. "He's not confessing," Fisher said, the words heavy with exhaustion. "He's negotiating the terms of their storage. He's worried about the temperature settings for the... exhibits."

Mr. Mabie looked up at him, her expression one of profound, sorrowful understanding. "You have taken his relics, Inspector," she said, her voice quiet but resonant in the empty corridor. "To him, you are not a policeman enforcing the law. You are a barbarian who has sacked his temple. He is not concerned with his own fate. He is concerned that you, a non-believer, will fail to observe the proper rites for his sacred objects." She paused, her gaze unwavering. "He will not confess to a crime, because in his soul, he has not committed one. He has performed a holy sacrament. To get him to admit guilt would be to demand he renounce his entire faith. He will not do it." Fisher stared at the peeling paint on the wall behind her. A sick theology. A reliquary of madness. The words she had used earlier now slotted into place with chilling precision. He was not dealing with a criminal mind, but with a warped and terrible piety.

Hours later, the first weak light of dawn began to seep into Clara’s flat, turning the dark grey of her despair into a paler, more hopeless shade. She had not slept. She had sat in the chair, feeling the phantom itch of her severed thumb, a constant reminder of its real-world counterpart, frozen and alone in the dark. The collector. The word had echoed all night. But as the light grew, another word began to push back against it. Angel. The name he had given her, given them. It was the root of his madness, the premise of his entire horrific belief system. He had seen their compassion, their endless, thankless giving on the wards, and he had twisted it into a supernatural attribute.

A thought, small and sharp as a needle, pierced through her fog of horror. He was wrong about everything, but he was not wrong about that. The compassion was real. The quiet strength was real. It was the essence of her job, of her identity. He had tried to capture it, to freeze it, to own it by taking a physical token. But he had failed. The symbol was not the thing itself. Her ability to care, to soothe, to heal—that was not in her thumb. It was in her mind, her heart, her training. It was in the remaining nine fingers and the tired, aching spirit that still knew how to comfort a stranger in the middle of the night. He had stolen a piece of her, but he had not stolen her purpose. A new resolve, cold and hard and clear, settled in her chest. She finally bent down and picked up her phone from the floor. She scrolled through her contacts, her left thumb moving with a new, determined precision. She found the number for the ward sister at City General. She pressed the call button. When a familiar, sleep-roughened voice answered, Clara spoke, her own voice steady and strong. "Hi, Maggie, it's Clara," she said. "I need you to do me a favour. I need you to check the rota. I need to know when I can come back to work."Chapter 7

The familiar scent of the ward—bleach, latex, and the faint, sweetish odour of human frailty—hit Clara like a physical force. It was the smell of home, but a home she was now visiting as a stranger. She wore civilian clothes, a baggy jumper and jeans that felt clumsy and out of place amidst the crisp blue tunics of her colleagues. Sarah met her by the nurses' station, her smile a little too bright, her hug a little too careful, her eyes flicking constantly to Clara’s right hand, which was now in a smaller, more functional dressing but was still a conspicuous symbol of what had happened. The twelve-hour shifts that had once been her rhythm were now an impossible mountain, and she felt the chasm between the nurse she was and the woman she had become.

Her colleagues brought her tea in the staff room, their conversation stilted, peppered with awkward silences. They talked about patients she didn't know, about rota changes that no longer affected her, about the new security protocols in the car park. They were trying to be normal, but their kindness was a constant, gentle reminder of her new status as a fragile outsider. While Sarah recounted a story about a difficult patient, Clara watched a junior nurse deftly use her thumb to flick the cap off a syringe. It was a tiny, unconscious movement, one of a thousand such dexterous acts performed every hour on the ward. The sight sent a sharp pang of grief through her, more acute than the phantom pain in her hand. He hadn't just taken a digit; he had stolen her fluency, her professional muscle memory. He had made her a tourist in the only country she had ever truly known.

The case file on DI Fisher’s desk was thick, solid, and deeply unsatisfying. On paper, it was a slam dunk. The forensics team had matched the DNA from Clara’s thumb—logged as exhibit KH/04—to her national database record. The archival dust in Abhishek’s flat was a perfect match for the samples from the Royal London Archives. The clippers found on his floor were, without a doubt, the tool he had used. They had everything except the one thing Fisher craved: a coherent motive that the law could understand. The Crown Prosecution Service was pleased with the evidence but was already preparing for a defence of diminished responsibility. The legal system had a box for this: madness. It was a neat, tidy label that would explain the inexplicable.

But Fisher, haunted by the memory of Abhishek’s pleading eyes in the interview room, felt the label was a dangerous oversimplification. He wasn’t just mad. He was devout. His delusion was structured, disciplined, and fuelled by a logic so complete within its own framework that it was almost impossible to penetrate. Fisher had dealt with killers who acted out of rage, greed, or lust. Their motives were ugly, but they were comprehensible. Abhishek had acted out of a twisted, all-consuming love. It was a motive that had no place in a courtroom, a motive that made the entire edifice of justice feel flimsy and inadequate. He was a monster, yes, but he was a monster who had wept for the sanctity of his collection, and that was a chilling paradox that kept Fisher awake at night.

In the cold, cramped vestry of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, Mr. Mabie laid out two cups on her small table. One for her, one for the DI Fisher she knew would eventually come. She had felt the psychic ripples of the arrest fade, the focused point of coldness now contained, but the sickness it had revealed in the city’s soul remained. The goblin was caged, but the forgotten spaces that had created him were still there. When Fisher knocked on the vestry door, she was not surprised. He looked older than he had in the alleyway, the weight of his unsatisying victory heavy on his shoulders. He accepted the cup of strong, black tea without a word.

“He will not confess,” Fisher stated, sitting heavily on the spare wooden chair. “He wants to know if we’re maintaining the correct temperature in the evidence freezers.” Mr. Mabie nodded slowly, her broad face impassive. “You have taken his god from him. Now you expect him to renounce it. That is not how faith, even a faith as broken as his, works.” She took a slow sip of her tea. “I have made an application to the prison service,” she said, her tone matter-of-fact. “To visit him. As a minister.” Fisher stared at her. “Why? He’s not one of your flock. He’s a psychopath who mutilates women.” “He is a hollow thing,” she corrected gently. “A spiritual vacuum. I have seen the damage a vacuum can do. But I do not believe it must remain empty forever. My mission was to face the predator. Perhaps it is now to understand the man.”

The digital world was Clara’s only ward now. The messages between her and Anjali had become a daily ritual, a shared space where they could speak the language of their trauma without translation. *'Priya started therapy,'* Anjali typed. *'She hates it. She says the therapist looks at her like she’s a fascinating case study. Another person collecting a piece of her.'* The phrase hit Clara with the force of recognition. *'I know what she means,'* Clara typed back, her left hand moving more confidently over the keys. *'I went to the hospital today. They all look at me like I’m a ghost. The Ghost of Clara Past. The one with ten fingers.'* They were both specimens now, one for the psychologists, one for the pitying eyes of her former colleagues. They were defined not by who they were, but by what had been done to them.

Anjali sent a link to a news article. It was a small, cautious piece in a local paper, mentioning the arrest in connection with the ‘Hospital Attacker’ case but giving few details. The names of the other victims, Eleanor Vance and Sophie Chen, were mentioned for the first time. Clara stared at the names. Eleanor. Sophie. They weren’t just tags on a frozen bag anymore. They were women, like her, like Priya. Women who were now walking through the world with a piece of themselves missing, living in the shadow of a goblin’s love. They were out there, alone with their own ghosts, their own phantom limbs. A new purpose, clearer and more urgent than her desire to return to work, began to form in her mind. Her healing wasn't about going back. It was about moving forward, and she realised with sudden, startling clarity that she could not do it alone.

She opened a new tab, a social media site, and typed Eleanor Vance’s name into the search bar. Then Sophie Chen’s. She was a nurse. Her job was to find the patient, assess the wound, and begin the treatment. The wound was not just hers anymore; it belonged to all of them. The goblin had his collection, a static, frozen archive of stolen moments. Clara took a deep breath and began to type a message. She would start her own collection. Not of relics, but of survivors. His was a catalogue of angels. Hers would be a congregation of the living.The familiar scent of the ward—bleach, latex, and the faint, sweetish odour of human frailty—hit Clara like a physical force. It was the smell of home, but a home she was now visiting as a stranger.

As a minister.” Fisher stared at her. “Why? He’s not one of your flock. He’s a psychopath who mutilates women.” “He is a hollow thing,” she corrected gently. “A spiritual vacuum. I have seen the damage a vacuum can do. But I do not believe it must remain empty forever. My mission was to face the predator. Perhaps it is now to understand the man.”

The digital world was Clara’s only ward now. The messages between her and Anjali had become a daily ritual, a shared space where they could speak the language of their trauma without translation. *'Priya started therapy,'* Anjali typed. *'She hates it. She says the therapist looks at her like she’s a fascinating case study. Another person collecting a piece of her.'* The phrase hit Clara with the force of recognition. *'I know what she means,'* Clara typed back, her left hand moving more confidently over the keys. *'I went to the hospital today. They all look at me like I’m a ghost. The Ghost of Clara Past. The one with ten fingers.'* They were both specimens now, one for the psychologists, one for the pitying eyes of her former colleagues. They were defined not by who they were, but by what had been done to them.

Anjali sent a link to a news article. It was a small, cautious piece in a local paper, mentioning the arrest in connection with the ‘Hospital Attacker’ case but giving few details. The names of the other victims, Eleanor Vance and Sophie Chen, were mentioned for the first time. Clara stared at the names. Eleanor. Sophie. They weren’t just tags on a frozen bag anymore. They were women, like her, like Priya. Women who were now walking through the world with a piece of themselves missing, living in the shadow of a goblin’s love. They were out there, alone with their own ghosts, their own phantom limbs. A new purpose, clearer and more urgent than her desire to return to work, began to form in her mind. Her healing wasn't about going back. It was about moving forward, and she realised with sudden, startling clarity that she could not do it alone.

She opened a new tab, a social media site, and typed Eleanor Vance’s name into the search bar. Then Sophie Chen’s. She was a nurse. Her job was to find the patient, assess the wound, and begin the treatment. The wound was not just hers anymore; it belonged to all of them. The goblin had his collection, a static, frozen archive of stolen moments. Clara took a deep breath and began to type a message. She would start her own collection. Not of relics, but of survivors. His was a catalogue of angels. Hers would be a congregation of the living.Chapter 8

The words felt both invasive and necessary. Clara’s left index finger hovered over the 'send' button, the message typed out in the sterile blue light of the screen. *My name is Clara Hale. I was one of the women attacked by the man they called the Thumb Taker. I saw your name in a news article. I know this is a strange and forward thing to do, but I thought… I thought perhaps you might want to talk. To someone who understands.* It was a message in a bottle, cast into the vast, indifferent ocean of the internet. She copied it, found the profile for Sophie Chen, and sent it again. For a long moment, she stared at the two sent messages, two identical acts of faith, and felt a profound, stomach-churning vulnerability. She had taken her private pain and made it public, at least to these two strangers. She had no idea if they would welcome the contact or recoil from it as another form of violation.

The first reply came less than an hour later, a single, sharp line from Eleanor Vance. *How do I know this isn't some sick joke?* The suspicion was a cold slap, but Clara understood it perfectly. In their new world, caution was the only logical response. She hesitated for only a second before acting. With her left hand, she took a photograph of her right. It was unbandaged now, the neat, puckered line of the stitches stark against her skin, the unnatural flatness where her thumb should have been. It was her new signature, her grim passport. She attached the image to her reply with a simple, three-word message: *Because of this.* The response came back almost immediately. *Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Yes. We should talk.*

The visiting room at HMP Belmarsh was a monument to institutional despair. It was a space scrubbed clean of all character, painted in a shade of grey designed to soothe but which only seemed to deaden the spirit. Mr. Mabie sat on a hard plastic chair bolted to the floor, her heavy silver cross tucked inside her shirt. This was a place where overt symbols of faith could be seen as a challenge or a weapon. She was here not as a representative of the Orthodox church, but as a student of the human soul, and her subject was about to be brought before her. The door on the far side of the thick glass partition opened, and Abhishek was led in. He was smaller in the unflattering grey prison tracksuit, a splinter of a man whittled down even further. He didn't look at her. He sat down and stared at the reflection of his own gaunt face in the glass.

“My name is Mabilia Mabie,” she began, her voice calm and even, carrying easily through the small grille. “We met, briefly, in an alleyway near St. Jude’s.” Abhishek’s head snapped up, his eyes, dark and furious, finally meeting hers. “You,” he hissed, the word full of venom. “You were there. You shouted. You are the one who broke the silence.” The accusation was delivered with the force of a religious curse. “You ruined it. It was a perfect moment. It was pure. And you and your noise, you corrupted it.” Mr. Mabie did not flinch. She saw past the anger to the profound, panicked grief beneath it. “The moment was already corrupt, Abhishek,” she said softly. “It was built on a foundation of another’s terror. That is not purity. That is consumption.” He recoiled as if she had struck him. “You don’t understand. You couldn't. You are part of the world that grinds them down, that makes them old and tired. I was saving them. I was taking one perfect note from the symphony before the whole thing fades to static.” He was speaking his gospel, defending his faith. Mr. Mabie leaned forward slightly, her gaze holding his. “Tell me about the symphony,” she said, choosing her words with the care of a surgeon. “Tell me about the first note. Tell me about your first angel.”

DI Fisher signed the last page of the preliminary report for the Crown Prosecution Service, his signature a tired scrawl. The file was a masterpiece of forensic diligence and procedural correctness. It was also, he knew, a complete fiction. It told the story of a disturbed man who committed a series of assaults, was identified through diligent police work, and was now awaiting trial. It omitted the strange, unnerving truth of the case: that the key to his capture had been a Bulgarian Orthodox Reverend with a theory about spiritual coldness, and that the case was solved by a combination of archival dust and the victims themselves piecing together the true nature of their attacker's delusion. He felt less like a detective and more like a clerk, tidying up the messy, terrifying reality of Abhishek Kumar's soul into a format the legal system could process.

His phone rang, and he saw Clara Hale's name on the screen. He was glad to hear her voice, which sounded stronger, more resolute than before. But his relief curdled into professional alarm as she told him what she was doing. “Clara, I have to advise you against this,” he said, his tone shifting into officialdom. “You are all primary witnesses in a major criminal case. Contacting each other could be seen as collusion, as contaminating testimony…” He was reciting from the rulebook, but the words tasted like ash. He was telling a woman whose life had been torn apart that she was not allowed to seek comfort from the only other people on the planet who could possibly understand. “With all due respect, Inspector,” Clara’s voice came back, firm and unwavering, “my testimony is a scar on my hand. It can’t be contaminated. This isn’t about the trial. This is about what comes after. We’re not your witnesses anymore. We’re just trying to figure out how to be people again.” Fisher was silent for a moment. She was right. The police part of the story was over. Hers was just beginning. “Keep me informed,” he said, his voice softer. “Off the record. Just so I know you’re all alright.”

The café was a neutral space, chosen for its anonymity and its noise, a constant, low-level clatter that felt like a shield. Clara got there first, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm against her ribs. She ordered a coffee she knew she wouldn’t drink and sat facing the door. Eleanor Vance arrived five minutes later. She was older than Clara, maybe in her late forties, with tired lines around her eyes that spoke of a long career on the wards. Her right hand was tucked into the pocket of her coat. She scanned the café, her eyes meeting Clara’s, a flicker of mutual recognition passing between them. Two soldiers who had fought in the same secret war. She sat down, and for a long, agonizing moment, they just stared at each other, the air thick with everything they couldn’t say.

Eleanor spoke first. “St. Jude’s,” she said, her voice quiet. “Geriatrics. Thirty years a nurse.” It was a statement of identity, a declaration of the life that had been interrupted. “City General,” Clara replied. “A&E. Twelve years.” The introductions hung in the air, a shared C.V. of compassion. Eleanor slowly pulled her hand from her pocket and laid it on the table. The scar was older, paler than Clara's, the stump of the thumb small and neat. It was a wound that had healed, but was still profoundly present. Almost involuntarily, Clara placed her own hand on the table beside Eleanor’s. Two incomplete hands, side-by-side. It was a grotesque and heartbreaking tableau, a silent communion of their shared loss. Eleanor looked at their hands, and the professional composure she had maintained for thirty years finally broke. A single tear tracked a path through the tired lines on her face. “He took my career,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I can’t do the job anymore. The dexterity… it’s gone. I… I’m a Matron now. I fill out paperwork. After thirty years of holding hands and saving lives, he’s turned me into a clerk.” The shared grief was so potent it was almost a third presence at the table. Clara reached out with her left hand and laid it over Eleanor's. It wasn't the practiced, professional comfort of a nurse. It was the simple, desperate solidarity of a fellow survivor. The congregation had its first two members.The words felt both invasive and necessary.

Sophie Chen was a whirlwind of brittle energy. She burst into the café ten minutes late, her youth a stark contrast to Eleanor’s weary resignation. She was barely in her mid-twenties, a newly qualified paediatric nurse, and her anger was a physical presence, a crackling aura that kept the world at arm’s length. She didn’t sit down so much as drop into the chair, her eyes darting from Clara to Eleanor, then to their hands on the table. She shoved her own right hand, encased in a tight black glove, into her lap.

“So this is it, is it?” Sophie said, her voice sharp. “The survivors’ club. I almost didn’t come. My mum said I should just try to forget it, move on.” She gave a short, bitter laugh that held no humour. “Easy for her to say. She can still button her own coat.” She finally looked at Clara properly, her defensive glare softening for a fraction of a second. “You were A&E, right? Hope General for me. Paediatrics. I’d only been qualified six months.” The last sentence was a gut punch, the story of a vocation extinguished almost at its inception.

“He smelled of old books and hospital soap,” Clara said softly, breaking the tense silence. It was not a question, but a statement of their shared creed. Sophie’s head snapped up. “And he cooed,” she whispered, the anger in her eyes momentarily replaced by a flicker of remembered terror. “Like a pigeon. A horrible, quiet, chittering sound, right in my ear.” Eleanor nodded slowly, her face ashen. “He was so strong. I thought my ribs would break. But it wasn’t an angry strength. It was… possessive.” The three women sat in a bubble of silence, the café’s clatter fading into a distant roar. They were no longer three individuals. They were a single entity, sharing a single, horrific memory. They were taking the fragmented shards of their trauma and piecing them together into a coherent whole. They were building their attacker, not from police reports, but from the intimate, terrifying details he had imprinted on their bodies and minds.

“Angel,” Clara said, the word falling into the centre of the table like a stone into a still pond. “He called you that, didn’t he?” Sophie flinched as if struck. Eleanor closed her eyes, a muscle working in her jaw. “He whispered it,” Eleanor confirmed. “Like a prayer.” They looked at each other, and in that moment, something shifted. The shame and the isolation that had clung to each of them like a shroud began to dissipate, burned away by the heat of their shared reality. They were not random victims of a madman. They were a category. A type. They had been chosen, anointed in the most grotesque way imaginable. The knowledge was both horrifying and, in a strange way, empowering. It gave a name and a shape to the formless dread that had haunted them. They were his angels, and now, sitting together in this noisy, ordinary café, they were taking the name back.

The first angel was called Ananya. Abhishek spoke the name in the grey visiting room with a reverence that was chilling, his gaze turned inward to a memory that was more real to him than the room itself. “She was a nurse on the oncology ward at the Royal Marsden,” he told Mr. Mabie, his voice soft, almost melodic. “My mother was there for a very long time. The ward was a factory of death, full of tired people and the smell of chemicals. No one saw her. My mother. She was just another failing body in a bed. But Ananya saw her.”

He described the scene with the vivid, hallucinatory detail of a sacred vision. His mother, weak and frightened, unable to drink from a plastic cup. And the nurse, Ananya, at the end of a long, thankless shift, stopping. She didn’t just hand his mother the cup; she sat on the edge of the bed, held the straw to her lips, and used her thumb to gently stroke the back of his mother’s frail, paper-thin hand. “It was a small thing,” Abhishek whispered, tears tracking down his gaunt cheeks. “A tiny movement. But it was the only real thing that happened in that room in six months. It was a light. A piece of pure, uncut grace in a place of absolute despair.” He had watched Ananya for weeks after his mother died, a ghost haunting the hospital corridors, feeding his obsession. He watched her kindness, her quiet competence, and saw divinity. “She left,” he said, his voice breaking. “She moved to another city. The light went out. I couldn't let that happen again. I couldn't let that grace just… fade away. It had to be preserved. The part of her that gave the comfort. The part that had touched my mother. Her thumb.”

Mr. Mabie listened, her face a mask of deep, sorrowful concentration. The sickness had an origin. It was not a motiveless malignancy, but a seed of profound grief that had been watered with loneliness and neglect until it had grown into a monstrous, all-consuming tree. The goblin had not been born; he had been made, forged in the crucible of a hospital’s casual, everyday sorrow. “So you are not a thief, Abhishek,” she stated, not as a question, but as a summary of his entire worldview. “You are an archivist.” He looked up at her, his eyes wide with desperate gratitude. It was the first time anyone had understood. “Yes,” he breathed. “I am the archivist of angels. And you,” he added, a flicker of his earlier anger returning, “you and the men with guns, you have burned my library.”Sophie Chen was a whirlwind of brittle energy.

It was the first time anyone had understood. “Yes,” he breathed. “I am the archivist of angels. And you,” he added, a flicker of his earlier anger returning, “you and the men with guns, you have burned my library.”The silence that had settled over the small café table between Clara and Eleanor was heavy, but not empty. It was a space filled with thirty years of geriatrics and twelve years of A&E, a silence that understood the weight of bodies and the fragility of hope. It was broken by the hesitant arrival of a third woman. Sophie Chen moved through the tables not with anger, but with the cautious, wide-eyed terror of a hunted animal that has been forced out into the open. She was young, her face pale and drawn, and she wore a single black glove on her right hand, a stark affectation that was more revealing than any scar. She sat down, her body rigid, and clutched her gloved hand in her lap as if protecting it from a sudden blow, her eyes flicking between the two older women.

“I’m Sophie,” she said, her voice barely a whisper, a stark contrast to the brittle energy Clara had somehow expected. “Paediatrics at Hope General.” She looked down at the table, unable to hold their gaze. “I shouldn’t be here. My therapist says I need to focus on forward-looking strategies, not… this.” She made a vague gesture that encompassed the two of them, the café, their entire shared, unspoken horror. Eleanor, her own composure fragile, simply nodded. It was Clara who leaned forward, her voice low and steady, a nurse’s voice, designed to cut through panic. She didn’t ask a question. She offered a password. “He smelled of dust,” she said. “Like a very old library.”

Sophie’s head shot up, her eyes flooding with a terrifying mixture of relief and fresh grief. The carefully constructed wall of her composure crumbled into dust. “And soap,” she whispered, the words tumbling out. “That clean, cheap hospital soap. And he was so quiet. The silence was the worst part, until he… until he started making sounds.” The three of them were no longer separate entities. In that moment, they became a single repository of a shared nightmare. Clara spoke of the cooing sounds she had barely been able to describe to the police. Eleanor, her voice a low rasp, described the thin, wiry arm that had felt like an iron bar, a grip that was not violent but inexorably possessive. Clara then added the final piece to their grim puzzle. “I’ve been talking to the sister of another one of us. Priya Sharma, from the Royal Infirmary. It was the same for her. Exactly the same.”

Four women. A pattern. A ritual. The knowledge settled over them, cold and heavy. “There’s one more thing,” Clara said, her heart pounding as she prepared to speak the word that had haunted her sleep. “A name. He called me his angel.” Sophie let out a choked, half-sobbing gasp, her gloved hand flying to her mouth. Eleanor simply closed her eyes, a single, perfect tear escaping and tracing a slow path down her cheek. The word was a key, unlocking the last door to the true nature of their violation. It was not a random act of violence. It was a sacrament. They were not just victims; they had been anointed, chosen for their compassion and then punished for it, their symbol of care grotesquely harvested as a holy relic. In the noisy, anonymous café, they finally understood the terrifying, personal nature of what had been done to them.

While his unwilling congregation held its first synod, Mr. Mabie was undertaking her own pilgrimage. She had not gone to the prison, but to the Royal Marsden, the place where DI Fisher had told her Abhishek’s mother had died. The oncology wing was a world she understood. It had its own spiritual climate, a hushed, antiseptic blend of desperate hope, profound weariness, and the quiet, bureaucratic hum of machines that measured life in drips and beeps. She did not seek official records. She sought memory. In the staff room, she found a ward sister on the cusp of retirement, a woman with a kind, exhausted face and eyes that had seen more grief than most soldiers. Mr. Mabie did not introduce herself as a minister investigating a crime, but as a parishioner researching a paper on long-term pastoral care.

She spoke of the loneliness of families in hospitals, of the small acts of kindness that shine brightest in the darkest places. And then, gently, she asked if the sister remembered a family from years ago, a Mrs. Kumar, and her quiet, watchful son. The sister’s face softened with the effort of recollection, her mind sifting through a thousand forgotten sorrows. “Kumar,” she murmured. “Yes. A sad case. The son… Abhishek. He was a strange boy. He never spoke, just watched. He was like a shadow in the corridor for months. After his mother passed, he just… kept coming back. We had to ask security to have a quiet word. It wasn't healthy.”

“Was there a particular nurse who cared for his mother?” Mr. Mabie asked, her voice calm, betraying none of the intensity she felt. The ward sister’s expression cleared. “Oh, you must mean Ananya. A lovely girl, she was. Came over from Kerala. She had a gift, that one. She treated every patient like they were her own family. I remember her with Mrs. Kumar. The poor woman was so weak at the end. Ananya would sit with her, just holding her hand, stroking her thumb. She said it was something her own grandmother liked. A simple comfort.” Mr. Mabie felt a profound, sorrowful chill. It was real. The founding myth of Abhishek’s terrible faith was not a fantasy. It was a memory of a single, pure act of compassion, a moment of grace that his grieving, unmoored mind had warped into a monstrous theology.

Back in the café, the shared horror had burned itself out, leaving behind the cold, hard ash of reality. “He’s turned me into a clerk,” Eleanor said, the words brittle with a grief that went beyond her own wound. “I spent my life on my feet, at bedsides. Now I sit at a desk and manage budgets. He didn’t just take my thumb. He took my vocation.” Sophie, her earlier terror now hardened into a diamond-sharp anger, pulled the glove from her right hand with a single, sharp tug. The scar was angrier than the others, the healing less neat. “I was six months in,” she said, her voice shaking with rage. “I was supposed to be helping sick kids. Now, I can’t even look at the hospital without having a panic attack. He didn’t just maim me. He erased me. He erased the nurse I was supposed to become.”

Clara looked at the two women, at the career that was stolen and the one that had never been allowed to begin. She looked at her own hands, at the muscle memory that was now a lie. He had tried to turn them into static objects, frozen moments of perfection in his cold, dark room. He had tried to make them into relics. “No,” Clara said, the word quiet but unshakeable. “He didn't erase us. He just… edited us.” She looked from Eleanor’s face to Sophie’s, her own purpose finally crystallizing. “He has his collection. A catalogue of what he took. We need to make our own.” Sophie and Eleanor stared at her. “A collection of what?” Eleanor asked. “Of us,” Clara said, a fierce light in her eyes. “Of our stories. All of them. There are others. We find them. We are not his angels. We are not his collection. We are the evidence that he failed. His library is full of dead things. Ours will be full of the living.”Chapter 10

The idea, once spoken, hung in the air of the café, as tangible and as shocking as their scarred hands lying on the table. A collection of the living. For a moment, Sophie and Eleanor just stared at Clara, the clatter of the café seeming to recede into a distant hum. It was Eleanor, the pragmatist, the Matron, who broke the silence. Her voice was laced with a weary caution. “A collection for what, Clara? What would we do? The police inspector, he warned you. We’re witnesses. We’re not supposed to be… collaborating.” The word hung in the air, clinical and legalistic, a barrier between them.

“He’s collaborating with my nightmares every single night,” Sophie shot back, her voice low and fierce. The glove was back on her hand, a black shield. “He has a file on all of us. A neat little tag with our names on it. Are we supposed to just sit in our separate little rooms and wait for a trial that will call us psychologically compromised? I don’t want to be a piece of his collection. I want to burn it to the ground.” Her anger was a fire, and Clara felt its warmth. It was better than the cold fog of victimhood.

“Sophie’s right,” Clara said, her gaze steady, meeting Eleanor’s. “This isn’t about the trial. This is about the story that gets told afterwards. His story is in that freezer, a story about angels he ‘saved’. It’s neat, it’s simple, and it’s a lie. Our story is messy and complicated and ongoing. If we don’t tell it, his is the only one that will exist.” She took a breath, the plan solidifying as she spoke. “We find Priya. We find out what happened to her. We put all four of our stories together. Not as evidence for the police, but as testimony for ourselves. We are not exhibits. We are the authors.”

The logic was undeniable. It was a nurse’s logic: when faced with a disease, you study it, you share information, and you work together to fight it. Eleanor looked down at her hand on the table, the hand that could no longer properly check a pulse but could still sign off on a budget report. She had been forced into a world of paper. Perhaps it was time to use it. “Alright,” she said, her voice quiet but firm, a decision made. “We become the archivists.” The three of them sat in a circle of fragile, determined consensus. The goblin had his reliquary of frozen moments. They were about to build a library of beating hearts.

In the grey, soundless void of the prison visiting room, Mr. Mabie sat opposite Abhishek for the second time. He was more agitated today, his silence a coiled spring. He refused to look at her, his eyes fixed on a point on the wall just past her shoulder. He had allowed the visit, driven by a desperate, conflicted need to speak to the only person who had used the right words, the only person who had called him an archivist. Mr. Mabie did not press. She simply sat in the profound silence, her presence a solid, unmoving fact. Finally, he spoke, his voice a low hiss directed at the wall. “They won’t tell me. About the temperature. They think it’s a game.”

“Perhaps they do not understand the importance of your work,” Mr. Mabie said, her tone neutral. “Perhaps they do not know how it began.” She let the sentence hang in the sterile air. She saw a flicker in his eyes, a momentary engagement before the mask of sullen anger returned. She continued softly, her voice a deep, calm river. “I visited the Royal Marsden, Abhishek. I went to the oncology ward. I wanted to see the place where your library was founded.” This got his full attention. His head snapped towards her, his eyes wide with a mixture of fury and alarm. “You have no right,” he breathed. “That is a holy place. That is not for you.”

“I spoke to a woman who worked there,” Mr. Mabie went on, ignoring his anger, her gaze compassionate but unyielding. “A ward sister. She remembered your mother. And she remembered you. A quiet boy who watched from the corridors.” She paused, leaning forward just an inch. “And she remembered the nurse. The one with a gift. The one who was kind to your mother at the very end. She remembered Ananya.” The name, spoken aloud in this terrible, grey room, had a physical effect on Abhishek. He flinched violently, a choked sob escaping his lips. He squeezed his eyes shut, his whole body trembling, as if the memory was a light too bright to bear. He was no longer in the visiting room; he was back in that other room, the one that smelled of chemicals and despair, witnessing the single moment of grace that had defined and destroyed his life. When he finally spoke, his voice was the broken whisper of a grieving boy. “She stroked her hand,” he said to the glass partition, to the memory of Ananya, to the ghost of his mother. “She gave her water. Everyone else was just waiting. But Ananya… she was present. The light… it was in her thumb.”

Clara’s first call was to Anjali. She explained the plan, her voice clear and concise, the words flowing with a purpose that had been absent for weeks. Anjali listened, her silence on the other end of the line not one of hesitation, but of profound, thoughtful consideration. “Priya won’t talk to a stranger,” Anjali said finally. “She barely talks to me. But… she reads. She reads everything. Can you… can you write it down? Your story. Eleanor’s. Sophie’s. Not just what he did. Who you were. The nurse you were.” It was a brilliant suggestion, a way to communicate that bypassed the trauma of spoken words. It was an exchange of case notes, a sharing of charts. It was a language they all understood.

That evening, Clara sat at her laptop, the screen a bright rectangle in the dark flat. The blank page was an intimidating white desert. How could she describe the chaos of A&E, the adrenaline and the exhaustion, the gallows humour and the quiet, desperate moments holding the hand of a stranger? How could she explain that her thumb was not just a digit, but the tool she used to anchor a temporary splint, to find a difficult vein, to offer a silent squeeze of reassurance that meant *I am here, you are not alone*? She began to type, not for a police report or a therapist, but for Priya, a woman she had never met. She wrote about the smell of blood and disinfectant, about the symphony of the monitors, about the quiet satisfaction of a difficult diagnosis made, of a life pulled back from the brink. She wrote about the nurse she had been, a portrait of a woman defined by her compassion and her competence. Then, in a final, difficult paragraph, she wrote about a cold car park, the sodium glare, and a whisper of movement in the dark. She wrote about the angel. When she was finished, she attached the document to an email and sent it to Anjali. Then she forwarded the blank page to Eleanor and Sophie, with a simple subject line: *Our Collection. Volume 1.* The library was now open.The request for a document landed in Eleanor Vance’s inbox like a stone. She was at her desk in the Matron’s office, a glass-walled box overlooking the very ward at St. Jude’s where she had once walked miles every day. Now, her world was the steady hum of a desktop computer and the endless, sterile tide of paperwork. Staffing rotas, budget proposals, incident reports. She managed the nurses who did the job she no longer could. The email from Clara, with its simple, potent subject line—*Our Collection. Volume 1.*—was an artifact from another life. She opened the attachment, a blank page, and stared at it. A request to bleed onto a page for strangers. Her first instinct, the Matron’s instinct, was to dismiss it as ill-advised and emotionally reckless. But the nurse in her, the woman who had spent thirty years documenting the lives and deaths of others in meticulous notes, felt a different pull.

Later that night, in the quiet of her empty house, she sat where she now always sat: at her dining table, not in the comfortable armchair of the living room. It was a workspace. She opened her laptop, the blank page stark and demanding. What could she write? Her story felt like it had ended in that car park. She began to type, her movements stiff and formal, as if writing an official report. *Subject: Eleanor Vance, State Registered Nurse. Thirty years’ service.* She wrote about the weight of a dying man’s hand in hers, the surprising heft of it. She wrote about the specific smell of a C. diff infection, a smell no textbook could prepare you for. She wrote about the silent language of the ward, a raised eyebrow from a doctor, a quick nod from a colleague, a universe of meaning conveyed without a word. She described the practiced, perfect efficiency of her hands—the way her thumb and forefinger could peel back a dressing, find a vein, or secure a line with an economy of motion learned over decades. It was a lament, a eulogy for a pair of hands that no longer existed. As she wrote, the formal tone began to fray, and the raw grief of the clerk who longed to be a nurse bled through the lines, staining the official report with a deep, human sorrow.

Sophie Chen received the email and wanted to punch her laptop. A blank page. Another empty space she was supposed to fill. Her life was full of them now: the empty space on the rota where her name should be, the empty space in her day where a twelve-hour shift should be, the empty, echoing space in her head where the ambition and drive of a paediatric nurse used to be. She paced her small living room, the black glove on her right hand a tight, furious fist. Write her story? Her story was a single, brutal paragraph. She was a nurse. She was attacked. Now she was not a nurse. The end. She sat down, her anger a hot, bitter acid in her stomach, and started to type, not with the careful grief of Eleanor, but with a furious, staccato rhythm.

She wrote about glitter glue and the infuriatingly cheerful posters on the ward walls. She wrote about the terror of trying to get a cannula into the vein of a screaming toddler, your own heart breaking with every tiny sob. She wrote about the fierce, triumphant joy of seeing a child on the oncology ward finally get to ring the end-of-treatment bell, a sound more beautiful than any symphony. She wrote about the future she had mapped out, the specialist courses she had planned to take, the lives she was supposed to save, the nurse she was supposed to become. Her words were not a lament; they were an indictment. A furious, heartbroken accusation hurled into the void. It was a portrait not of who she had been, but of who he had murdered. When she was done, her whole body was shaking, and the black glove was damp with sweat. She attached the document to an email and hit send, the click of the mouse a small, sharp gunshot in the silent room.

In a quiet suburban house, Anjali printed Clara’s document and placed it on the small table beside Priya’s favourite armchair. Priya lived in that chair now, wrapped in a thick woollen blanket even on mild days, her gaze fixed on the birds in the back garden. She had built a fortress of silence around herself, and even Anjali, her beloved sister, was rarely allowed inside. Anjali didn’t say anything. She just placed the pages, face up, next to a cup of tea and retreated to the kitchen, her heart aching with a desperate hope. For an hour, the papers lay untouched. Priya watched a blackbird peck at the lawn, her face a still, placid mask. Then, slowly, as if the movement cost her a great deal of energy, her left hand reached out. She picked up the sheaf of papers.

She began to read. Her expression did not change at first. Anjali, watching from the kitchen doorway, saw her eyes moving across the lines of text. She read about Clara’s life in A&E, a world of controlled chaos so different from her own structured days on the surgical ward. She read about the moments of grace and despair, the language of nursing that was as familiar to her as her own name. Then her posture shifted. She leaned forward, her focus intensifying. Her breathing became shallow. Anjali knew she had reached the final paragraph. She was in the car park with Clara now, under the sickly sodium light. She was feeling the cold hand, hearing the whisper. She was feeling the sickening *snip*. A low, wounded sound escaped Priya’s lips, the first sound beyond a monosyllable she had made in weeks. She dropped the papers into her lap, her left hand flying to her right, cradling the incomplete hand she kept hidden under her blanket. Tears streamed down her face, silent and unstoppable. They were not tears of fear. They were tears of pure, unadulterated recognition. She was not the only one. She was not mad. She was not alone in the dark.

The origin story settled in Mr. Mabie’s soul like a piece of ice. Ananya. A name. A real person, whose simple act of human decency had been the seed of a monstrous pathology. Back in the cold vestry, surrounded by the wisdom of the Desert Fathers, she understood that she could not minister to Abhishek’s soul without first demythologizing his faith. As long as Ananya remained a flawless, abstract symbol of grace, Abhishek’s delusion would remain impenetrable. The symbol had to be made human again. The angel had to be brought back down to earth. She needed to find her. The thought of wading through decades of NHS records and immigration data was daunting. She needed resources she did not have. She needed a man who knew how to navigate the labyrinth of the state. She picked up her phone and called the one person in London who understood the strange intersection of theology and police work that this case had become.

“Inspector Fisher,” she said, her voice devoid of pleasantries when he answered. “I require your assistance. It is a matter concerning the root of our mutual problem. I need to locate the first angel.” There was a long pause on the other end of the line. Fisher, she knew, would be rubbing his tired eyes, wondering how his life had become a series of cryptic conversations with a Bulgarian Orthodox Reverend. “Mr. Mabie,” he said finally, his voice heavy with resignation, “my job is to put criminals in prison, not to track down mythological figures for the clergy.” “She is not a mythological figure,” Mr. Mabie corrected him calmly. “She is a former nurse named Ananya Sharma, last known to be working at the Royal Marsden over a decade ago. She is the key. To understand the sickness, we must understand its point of origin. Help me find her, Inspector. Off the record. Consider it… a consultation.” Another pause. Then a weary sigh. “Give me what you have,” he said. The alliance, forged in an alleyway and solidified in a fluorescent-lit corridor, held firm.

The emails arrived in Clara’s inbox within an hour of each other. First Eleanor’s, then Sophie’s. She opened Eleanor’s first, her heart pounding. The text was structured, almost formal, but the pain bled from it like ink from a water-damaged page. It was a story of a life’s work rendered obsolete, of a master craftswoman whose tools had been broken. Then she opened Sophie’s. It was a blaze of raw, furious energy, a scream of a future stolen, of a life erased before it had truly begun. Clara read them both, her own tears blurring the words on the screen. She was no longer just holding her own pain. She was the custodian of theirs, too. His collection was of severed parts. Hers was of fractured souls, laid bare in all their grief and rage. And yet, in the sharing, they were becoming something more. She created a new folder on her desktop, titling it simply: *The Angel Archive*. As she saved the second document, another email notification pinged. It was from Anjali. The subject line was a single word: *Priya*. The body of the email contained only a short, breathtaking sentence. *She has read it. She is writing.*
