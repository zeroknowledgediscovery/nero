West Des Moines woke with the quiet confidence of a suburb used to being overlooked. Morning spread along the cul-de-sacs and up the long green backs of the golf courses, through the damp grass of Raccoon River Park and across the glassy plates of office windows along University Avenue. The interstate grumbled. Somewhere, a dog barked twice and gave up. Mailboxes blinked their red flags in the early light like lazy cardinal beaks.

In a maple that had grown thick-shouldered and considerate in front of a beige house with a blue swing, a sprite named Lio opened his eyes. He was small enough to fold into a closed fist, bright enough to be mistaken for a glimmer of dust when he moved too quickly. He slept in the crease of a knotted branch that had learned his shape and bent toward him when he rolled over. Like all of his kind, he could taste the weather two days out, feel the curvature of a roofline with his toes, and listen to the city with his jaw pressed to bark.

West Des Moines spoke in hums. Tire-tire-stop. Cardinal shriek. Refrigerator drone. The premature squeal of a school bus brake and the neighbor’s outdoor unit kicking on like a cough. Lio loved them all. This city, with its clean fountains and coffee shops, had laced itself through him. He had scuffed his feet on its sidewalks and traced its power lines like guitar strings. He had learned, a long time ago, that he was not merely in West Des Moines but from it—made of it—like a bead of sap shaped by the wind, by kids shouting at the pool, by grocery stores with fluorescent light and watermelon pyramids.

When he woke, the breeze shifted lightly against his wing. It was almost nothing; an irregular shiver rippling across the treetops, like a rumor. He lifted his head and blinked into the maple’s leaves. He tasted something bitter in the air that did not belong to Wednesday.

“Don’t laugh,” he whispered to the tree, “but I think trouble’s late to breakfast.”

The maple rustled in a way he understood: maybe. The city breathed again.

Lio slid down the trunk and touched the grass with the pads of his fingers. The dew popped cold. He pushed off and rose, flickering over the yard, a gull of light no larger than a bluebird. The house’s front steps were warm already. He liked the steps; in the below-the-blue-time of late spring, they would soak him and he’d fall asleep there, listening to the whisper of the garage and the sighs in the windows. He darted to the mailbox. The red flag stirred; he kissed it, superstitious. He made a circle of one, two, three laps and then cut toward the sidewalk like a messenger who wanted to be caught.

At the corner, Marta Jensen emerged from her driveway with a travel mug, a tote bag, and keys between her teeth. She was thirty, loose-haired and freckled, edges softening and hardening in the way of someone who had been tired for a long time and had forgotten to stop. Lio hovered at the height of her ear, not close enough to startle. He had watched her plant tomatoes the week before; he’d held the tomato leaves at their base and pulled a little when the wind tried to bully them. Marta was not especially magical. She was spectacularly ordinary in a way that pleased him. She fed sugar to ants and argued with the city about a broken curb. She put money in a jar.

“Don’t forget your lunch,” he said, and blew instead of speaking.

She frowned. She looked back at her house, puzzled, then down at the bag at her feet, where a blue plastic container waited like a reminder she’d accidentally invented. A small flick of recognition crossed her face. She reached for it, smiled once, the way you do toward no one. Then she shook the keys out of her mouth and hurried on.

It was unfair, he knew, not to reveal himself. He was the kind of secret that insists on being a secret, because he comprehended the long slope of what might be lost if he wasn’t. Yet the urge to participate—mend a leaf, nudge a hand, rustle a shirt collar toward a sweater before rain—ate at him like hunger. And anyway, he had been told since he could first feel the burr of a backing-out minivan that he was destined. The word had been whispered to him by an older sprite with white eyes named Sia, who lived in the slender gleam of a wind chime on Eighth Street. The word had seemed ridiculous, a big coat for a small body, until it didn’t.

Destiny, Sia had said with a tongue click to mark the seriousness, doesn’t look like fireworks, little Lio. It looks like a meal you drop at the right door. It looks like getting someone to turn and wave for the photo. It looks like you, and it looks like millions; both ends of a rope. You’ll see.

He’d asked when. She’d said soon, then sighed, which for sprites meant maybe in ten years, maybe tomorrow afternoon.

Lio wound his way through the neighborhood, keeping low. He touched a lawn flamingo gently on the beak and whispered it instructions about a raccoon. He swam through the sprinkler birdsong of a yard on Grand Avenue and came to rest on the metal scrollwork of a cafe chair outside The Blue Quail. The Blue Quail smelled of milk foam and cinnamon and wet broom. Omar, the barista, propped open the door as he shoved the mat into place and sang false loudly to the empty morning: “Hell-ooo, coffee planet, I bring you beans!” Lio liked Omar’s voice. It sounded like a cheerful bird found in an alley behind a theater. Slightly off, a little brass.

He hovered near the register while Omar opened the drawer and counted bills. The machine whirred on. A big woman with gray hair came in and ordered a medium mocha with two whips, and while Omar nodded and bent, Lio nudged the raffle basket on the counter. The raffle was labeled Win a Free Muffin, which had always seemed both sincere and tiny. He tugged until a ticket stuck to the rim, flitted it toward the gray-haired woman’s elbow, and stuck it to her sleeve with a breath of sugar. She noticed when she reached for her wallet. They both laughed. It was such a small goodness it barely registered as a thing, and yet it sat inside him warm as the coffee air. He held it. He kept holding it until the taste of wrong whipcracked again along the street.

By noon, it was not the kind of wind that scolds trash bins nor the kind that learns the names of every flower. It was a cross-grained twist in the bones of the town. Lio climbed the sun and went higher, just below the places where hawks imagined him into gnats. He looked, because he had eyes made for seeing what the skin of the world trembles to hide. The shimmer around the mall looked like heat and not-heat, like three stacked panes of glass with someone breathing on the middle one. He smelled cedar and rust.

“Ah,” he said. “So it’s today.”

Jordan Creek Town Center squatted politely in its acreage of shining. Cars flowed and eddied. A child cried because he had dropped his fries. Lio skimmed over them all and slid beneath the mall’s electronic lungs, ducking a ceiling fan’s laziness. Inside, he dove through a cavern of bright-lit cheer. he felt the wide emptiness of 9 a.m. retail like a lake with no waves. On a second-level mezzanine, near a fountain that pretended to be mountain water, he saw a figure leaning against the glass.

The sprite was taller than Lio by a finger-length, darker by a shade that wasn’t exactly color. He wore a jacket with a seam that never quite found itself. Where Lio drifted at the edges of sight and seemed to be swallowed by light, this sprite gathered all the vague into him and made it distinct. He was beautiful and wrong.

“Riven,” Lio said. He had never met him, but he’d heard the name as a ripple between oak leaves and in the mouths of gutters during storms.

The sprite looked up. He had eyes like the glare off a lake in heat. He blinked once, slow and deliberate. “Familiar,” he said, and smiled. “Little Lio of the cul-de-sacs.”

“Where’s your tree?” Lio asked, because that is how you are polite to your own kind and also it was a way of saying I see you and I see where you belong, and you are not there.

Riven’s smile widened. “I live,” he said, “in the crane that goes up and then stops because someone changed their mind.” He tipped his head. “I live in a lion face carved over a door that no one looks at anymore. In an old radio that turns itself on at 3 a.m. and whispers the shipping forecast. I live wherever people don’t listen to what the bones of a thing are trying to say.”

Lio felt the urge to pull back, just a hair. “Those places are...frayed.”

“Yes,” Riven said simply, and put his palm on the glass. “They hum to me.”

The fountain gurgled haw-haw-haw as if it knew a joke no one else liked. Children leaned; their hands smudged stars onto the stainless steel. An aunt tossed a coin and kissed her fingers.

“You shouldn’t be here,” Lio said.

Riven’s laughter came out soft. “Neither should you,” he said, and then: “But here we are.”

There was a flavor of bravado in the air, like a cinnamon stick biting back. Lio hovered closer; Riven’s jacket smelled like thunderstorms over empty fields. He wanted to say the thing he’d been told to say, the only thing that had been given to him along with the word destiny. Instead, he said: “West Des Moines is mine.”

Riven’s head tipped once more and then very slightly, almost affection. “Is it?” he asked. “Or is it just a name for a place where a great many delicate things meet?”

Lio’s mouth opened and closed. The older sprites had warned him Riven spoke in pivots and knives; he'd slice you and then ask if you wanted a napkin. He tried another tack. “What do you want?”

Riven looked down at the fountain. His reflection jittered in the ripples, multiplying him into a dozen slender darks. “To pull the cover off,” he said. “To let everyone see what’s under the skin. To watch them react. To find the places where things break and press there. To—” he waved a hand as if selecting from a menu— “wreak havoc, darling. Isn’t that our word?”

Lio flinched. The plainness of it stripped the nonsense and left only the boulder of intent. Something in him hardened. “No,” he said, unable to keep the tremble from his voice. “Our word is make. Our word is mend. Our word is the little repair.”

Riven’s lips parted a fraction; behind them, his teeth were very white. “But I’m so bored,” he murmured.

A woman pushing a stroller passed them and sighed, the sigh of a stranger at the end of an ordinary rope. Riven watched her back. “Shall we play?”

The ripples in the world thrummed harder, as if an amplifier had been switched on somewhere no one could see. Lio felt the center of him hitch. Even in the mall with its seaming and stores and shiny try-ons, the city beneath the city stirred like a pond filling bladder by bladder.

“What are you going to do?” Lio asked.

Riven raised his hands in a pantomime of innocence. “Oh, not much. It’s a fine day. I thought I might pinch a power line and convince the traffic lights along Ashworth to sing the wrong colors. I might slip into the whisper of a newscaster and put a word in her mouth—just one, and a quiet one, but it will make someone at home swallow hard and think about the time a certain door wouldn’t open. I thought I might invite a gust to visit the roof of a warehouse and talk to the bolts about loosening as a way of life. It’s all—” he breathed as if inhaling exhaust— “so delicate. Don’t you ache with wanting to poke it and see what happens?”

“No,” Lio said. He understood that to hate Riven would be to fall into Riven’s size. He made himself very small instead, not as a retreat but as a point—the sharp tip of a needle threading through.

“You can’t stop the world from being a world,” Riven said kindly. “And I’m only interested in giving it the push it’s asking for.”

The fountain burped. Somewhere in the mall, a child started to cry, a little late, as if a joke had finally injured him. Lio went very still.

“I won’t let you,” he said quietly.

Riven blinked again, slowly, like a cat. “How will you not,” he asked, soft as breath, “when I am already?”

It began at a light where a woman named Elaine waited in her sedan with her two-year-old singing nonsense in the back seat. The green became red and then settled into green again abruptly and the car in the intersection bellowed its horn at a truck that had trusted the yellow. No one was hurt; they shuffled; they went. But the flicker of wrong sent a ripple of wrong outward and other lights puckered into mischief and then a string of timing along a long carp of road went off by a heartbeat and now the city’s temper twitched convulsively.

Lio could feel it. He jerked and was already moving. Riven did something that counted as a shrug and strolled along the railing, hands in his jacket pockets. Lio dropped into the air like a bead of rain toward a leaf and flew hard for the cluster of lights that had gone fickle near Valley West Drive. He was an idiot for not thinking this could happen, and also he had always known. He could taste iron at the back of his tongue. He could smell hot rubber.

At the intersection, a powder-blue minivan driven by a man whose mind was ironed thin with worry squeezed into a too-narrow gap and the woman in the silver CR-V who had decided to let kindness be aggressive today braked too hard and the man behind her gave her bumper a kiss that felt like a smack. Lio slipped and threaded the fishes of movement and hovered over a child’s dangling foot. He drifted into a vent with the green breath of the traffic control box and whispered. His whisper went like this: remember. Remember what you are for. Remember the rhythm you learned when you were first plugged into the grid, when the power ran like sunlight down your throat. It went ba-da, ba-da, ba. Keep that.

The light blinked. It wasn’t miraculous. It simply went good again. Not all of them did. Some were still having their little tantrums. But something softened; a hand unclenched. The cars sorted themselves clumsily back into order, embarrassed and angry and fine.

Across the city Riven touched and splayed and pressed and stepped away. He left a basement door unlocked and a string of three words in a comment section that would fester. He gave a white-haired man a sudden memory of the time someone had asked Where were you? and made him short with his wife. He did not make disasters; he made microclimates of oops and almost and why did you, so tiny any person would call them nothing. But the aggregate—the aggregate before dinner—is a kind of prophecy.

Lio raced from flicker to flicker, mending what was closest to breaking. He soothed a frightened dog that had bolted into the street and steered him into the arms of a teenager who was already crying. He warmed the cold patch on a baby’s back with a whisper of wool. He crawled along the seam of a bridge and turned a screw with his hands. He was sweating. Sprites sweat with light; it beaded him like thorn dew.

He knew he needed help. Not the kind his own kind could give, because there were so few of them and they folded themselves into corners. The ordinary people moved in oceans, uncoordinated, constant. He remembered Sia saying millions, the tip of her tongue resting for a heartbeat against her teeth on the m like she liked the way it felt.

He stopped at dusk on the top of the big red sculpture outside the civic center—the one that looked like a gash and a ribbon at the same time—and sat still until a fly tried to walk across his wing. He wanted to laugh, but he was half ruined. He was shaking with tired. The wind smelled of popcorn, mulch, hot pennies.

“You’re taking it too personally,” Riven said. He was suddenly sitting on the opposite edge of the sculpture, jacket open, hair moving like someone had run a finger through it in a way that could start a religion. The city glowed behind him as if coal was burning under it. “Can you feel them? The seven who decided not to look both ways, the nineteen who will read words that pick at their scabs, the sixty-three whose small meannesses will stick to their keyboards like jelly. It’s delicious.” He closed his eyes to savor it. “I have never had so much to eat.”

“You’re small,” Lio said, and meant it tenderly, and meant it cruelly. “If all you want is to stir.”

Riven’s eyes snapped open. “No,” he said, very softly. “I want to see the bones. I want to see if the big thing breaks when I push a small place. I want to crack the clear ice and watch the fish bump against the underside.”

Lio stood. He did not wobble.

“And then what?” he asked, almost curious. “If you break the ice and the fish bump? Do you look at yourself in the shine and clap? Do you lay your head down and go to sleep like a full cat? Do you become wind and go somewhere new?”

Riven looked past him and smiled. “Then I do it again.”

Night slid across the parking lots. The lights atop the old water tower woke and blinked like a patient. Far away a train called its loneliness into the bones of houses. Lio could feel the town bearing him in its unintentional arms. He could feel millions out past the fields and across the rivers and above the glows of other cities, all of them breathing, all of them an ocean he could not lift alone. He thought about telling them. A hush like a held breath settled into him.

You’re not ready, said the part of him that loved to fuss with a hinge and collect bottle caps that looked like moons. But the other part—the part made of the same thing as the heavy clouds that come just before the sky breaks open—said: you were made for this.

Sia found him there. She came carrying the echo of wind chimes and a smell like old copper. She sidled along the red metal and patted his shoulder with a hand not quite there.

“You didn’t tell me it would hurt,” he said into her shoulder. He sounded young, even to himself.

“Oh,” Sia said, gently, “my dear. Everything you love is going to ache sometimes. That’s how you know you love it.”

He laughed and then made a noise that had not decided if it wanted to be a laugh or a sob. Sia tucked it into her pocket.

“He’s hungry,” Lio said.

“He’s a hole,” Sia said mildly. “Hunger is a different thing. Hunger asks to be fed. A hole asks only to be made bigger. Which, to be fair, is a kind of hunger if you look at it slantwise. We can’t fill him. He will have to bump his mouth on the bottom by himself. What we can do is knit while he gnaws.” She tilted her head at him. “Do you remember how?”

Lio nodded. His throat worked. “Yes. I just—” He gestured helplessly with one hand, as if to say City. And then: “I need them. The ones with hands and phones and tired brains, the ones who buy stamps.”

“And dogs,” Sia said, smiling, because she could not help herself, “and those little sticky notes with lines on them.”

He nodded. He closed his eyes. He could feel the map of the city like veins, but he could also feel the rough map of the world with its bristles and beloveds and easy cruelties. He did not need them all right now, but he needed the knowledge of them—all that motion—that he would at some stupid and enormous point be able to ask.

“How?” he asked. “They can’t hear me. Not really.”

“Not with their ears,” Sia said, and then touched his forehead. “With their mirror parts. With the places in them that make. With the places that still know how to mend.”

“Yes,” Lio said. He thought about the coffee shop and the raffle ticket and Marta’s plastic container. He thought about the boy who had caught the dog. He breathed and tasted not just West Des Moines but something wider—the idea of it, the ache of it, the very human mania for putting up posters when they lost something and showing up with casseroles when someone died. He had felt those tendencies in a thousand kitchens. He could ask them. He was allowed to. He was built to.

Riven had vanished into the night. But his residue remained, a cold stripe along Lio’s inside edge. Lio rose into the air and drifted over the slow river. He tried out words without saying them: help me. help us. let’s. please. He shook them and listened for their true parts. He tested the web. He tugged and felt what shivered toward him.

He needed a proof. Not a miracle. A proof of ask-and-answer. Across the river, near the softball diamonds, a young man named Dae had flattened the battery in his mother’s sedan with the radio and then the lights and then the panic of trying it again. He sat in the car with his forehead against the wheel. He had messed up so many small things that day it felt like a braided rope of mess. He did not cry because he had a promise to himself not to.

Lio slid through the cracked window. He perched on the plastic curve of the dashboard and looked at Dae’s cheek. He’d seen Dae before, leaning against the fence of the skate park, watching kids who were not any better than him do something with a little more conviction. Lio placed his palm on the ignition and whispered: not by car.

Then he left the car and climbed onto the roof. He looked up and flared his wings once and felt the air look at him. He said, without sound, to whomever was nearby and kind: go to him. He is alone and angry at himself and he hates the part of him that is sweet because it seems useless. Go now. Please. Please.

Two minutes later, a minivan with a Wonder Woman sticker eased into the lot. Marta Jensen got out. She did not know why she turned in. She had been on her way home from getting eggs. Her nagging thought about a plant she had forgotten to water had somehow become a pull toward the park. She stood with one hand on her hip and looked at the empty fields. She felt foolish and then saw the young man slumped in the sedan and thought: if my kid were in that car, I would want someone to knock. So she walked over and knocked.

Dae looked up, startled, furious. Then he saw her face and something in him unhooked. Marta, who had grown up in a town where you handed jumper cables like you handed cookies, smiled uncertainly and lifted the cables in her hand. “Do you…?” she said, leaving the question open like a door.

In ten minutes they had the engine roaring and both of them were a little dazed by the straightforwardness of the fix. Marta laughed too loudly and said, “Bring the cables back if you think of it but if you don’t, don’t, honestly.” Dae nodded and said “My bad, thanks, I’m sorry,” a handful of words that did not quite know where to sit. They arranged themselves eventually in the soft places of his chest, in the spot where resentment had been hanging like a cloud.

Lio sat on the curve of the bleachers and watched them leave, a little dizzy with the rightness of it, how simple and unsimple it had been. He realized he was clenching his fists so hard his knuckles squeaked. He let them go. He put his hand on the cool aluminum and pressed his ear to it and listened to the small electricity of Huh, okay that flitted along the metal, from Dae, from Marta, from him, from the night.

“Millions,” Sia had said, as offhand as if she was predicting a light rain. It had terrified him then because it had been unimaginable. Now it was simply a number with a rhythm, a hum he could hold in his mouth and test with his teeth. He began to think the way sprites think when they are about to get inside everything: that odd, serious looseness that allows for luck and for people.

He went home before dawn. He fell asleep in his crease in the maple, his body dusty with tired light. He slept and dreamed that the city was a giant held gently in the arms of a thousand cats, and the giant laughed and laughed, and in the laugh the cats let go of their claws.

In the morning hope was not hot and new; it was as ordinary as oatmeal. He pushed himself upright and peeled a bit of bark from his cheek, guilty and content at once. He might have chosen rest. He did not, because rest would not stop the other sprite from pressing on seams, and because the flavor of ask-and-answer had settled into him like a sugar he could not stop tasting. He stepped into the day like a swimmer into a cold lake; it hurt and then it was the right temperature and he knew the shape of his own arms again.

He went first to the blue house with the swing. The swing was not swinging because there was no one on it; Lio touched the knot and felt the memory of last afternoon clapping around it. He considered the way he would do this. It had to be quiet and enormous. It had to be something that could be done by hands and by people unwilling, generally, to be told what to do.

He did not write down a plan. He did not name it. He began by asking, one by one, the people who had always been waiting to be asked. He woke them in the middle of small things—the scrubbing of a pan, the opening of a browser, the pinning of a sheet on a line—and blew into them a curiosity: what if. It was the same way he moved a leaf to the side so it would catch more light.

He went to a bus driver named Eli and said See the old woman who missed her stop three times this week because she falls asleep? Could you make a small sign that says Do You Need Me To Wake You? He went to a high schooler painting a cardboard sign for a protest and whispered Maybe make three smaller ones for the janitors who can’t attend; tape them up in the break room. He touched a city clerk’s pen and said What if you bring a bowl to the front desk and write TAKE ONE, IT IS A DAYFUL? These were tiny inventings, so small they were not even ideas. But they were what he had. They were what he knew how to lift.

Riven had not stopped. He had moved to the weather and whispered into a low pressure system an invitation to hurry. He had leaned against a stack of exploitable boredom in an office and made a man say something unforgivable about a coworker’s mother. He cut the adagio of a violinist at a student recital short by a breath, giving the girl a memory of failing in front of everyone that she would carry like a shard. It was all things that could have happened anyway, which made him smirk. He didn’t invent; he nudged.

Lio felt each new bruise as if it were a bruise on a shin he had recently bumped. He held himself upright by thinking about Marta’s cables, about the scarecrow with a crooked hat someone had made in a community garden, about the bowl of Dayful candy that had elicited thirty-two small smiles and two grumpy looks that softened later. He thought: I want to ask them all at once.

The thought made him light-headed. He looked up past the maple at the square of sky above him. He could feel the city’s WIFI networks snagging and unspooling all around him; he could feel the way the web trapped light and threw it; he could taste the static that powered a million screens. He was made of older things, of wood and wind and thumbprint, but he was also born into remarks and scrolling. He could align them. If he asked right.

He perched on the lip of the mailbox—it had been good luck before—and pressed his whole body against the red flag until its color sank into his skin. Then he lifted his face and spoke the ask, not with the air but with the hum that runs under every hum.

It went like this: if you can hear me, please do one small repair. Choose anything close to you. Fix a thing that has gone shy of being itself. Be unshy about it. And tell someone—not me, not a column, but each other. So one becomes two becomes ten and then we are a pile on a floor that laughs at gravity.

He pressed send. If a word like that existed. He shivered with a fear so sweet it might have been pleasure. He waited.

At first it felt like nothing. He felt foolish for the seventh time. He was a creature who worried about the sun on a basil plant. He had just asked the whole world to care. The disconnect between those realities bit his shoulder.

Then he felt a door open. It was somewhere very far away; he tried to pin it and couldn’t, it was everywhere; it was in a grocery in a town with a hill; it was on a barge; it was on a bus across from a man with a hat slightly too large for his head. It was in West Des Moines. It was in the maples and the minnows and the places where the ordinary majority live and reheat leftovers and talk to themselves. A woman wiped a smear from a stranger’s cheek with a corner of her shirt and laughed because she had done something so intimate without permission and the stranger grinned and said “Thanks.” A boy in an apartment taped a note to the elevator that read If you need your package carried up, text me. Two garbage cans were pulled in from the curb and the person who owned them never knew by whom.

Lio shook. He felt the city catching, in small points. He felt something old turn its head inside people, something that had been looking at an ancient fire and was now squinting at a phone screen and saying I know this, I know how to make this move. He felt the first video go up, shaky and mumbly, of a woman saying, “Okay, so I don’t know what this is, but I did a… a mend? I don’t even sew, but like…” and her laugh was the best part. He felt the second and third and the comments that said me too and what if and the private copy-and-paste that said Let’s all.

Riven paused with his hand in a jar of civil restlessness. He looked toward the maple as if he could see through everything. His mouth made a shape that should have been O but wasn’t. He tasted something like lemon.

“Oh,” he said, very softly, in a voice that meant he had been truly surprised. “He asked.”

He did not retreat. He did something worse. He smiled in a way that had no sweetness in it at all and said “Good,” as if the fact of an answer made the game finally interesting. He slid his other hand into another jar and stirred. He was going to make sure there were more seams. He was going to see if all the fingers that had come out to stitch could keep up.

Lio didn’t see that smile. He saw the light in the kitchen of an apartment spark on and a woman with wet hair hold her phone as if it were an egg and whisper Okay into it. He saw a cashier call an older man by his name and the older man look, surprised, and stand straighter under it. He saw a hundred hands do a hundred small repairs that were actually proof, and not of what he’d intended—nothing clean like that—but of what they had all been wanting to do anyway and had been needing someone to hand them permission for.

He leaned back against the red flag and closed his eyes once. He was so tired. He was so awake. He didn’t realize he was crying until a little of the salt got into a crack on his lip and stung.

Across the city, Sia closed her eyes and smiled because the kind of big she had been waiting for had finally stopped pretending. Somewhere a high school English teacher put aside her grading and went out to sweep someone else’s sidewalk. Somewhere a nurse wrote FOODS I CAN COOK WHEN YOU’RE SICK on a paper and taped it to the break room fridge. The web caught and flexed and did not break.

Lio took a breath. He knew he would have to learn how to ride this. He would have to teach and fan and hold together and be held. He would have to find a way to run contrary to a creature whose pleasure was making sure nothing stayed whole for long. But he could already feel it: the ground under him had changed. He had asked, and someone had said yes, and then many someones, and in the millions of small yeses there was a shape of a hand he could grab. He did. He grabbed it.

“Okay,” he said to West Des Moines, and his voice shook and steadied. “Okay, then. Let’s go.”Morning opened like a careful eye. It blinked along the flat planes of the office parks and pried itself into the hollows of porches, found the lint behind televisions and the small scuffs on baseboards and the soft undone shoelaces waiting by doors. Lio rose into it with the ache of someone who had held a rope all night, fingers sleeping and waking, palms mapped with the marks of grip. The sweetness that had slid into him the day before had not turned stale in the dark; it had settled into the joints of things like oil. West Des Moines stretched, and with the stretch came the first answering hums: a cashier pinning a handwritten note that read Tell me if I forget to ask how you are onto the register edge; a boy carrying his neighbor’s recycling bin all the way up the walk instead of dropping it in the polite middle; a girl at a bus stop sticking a bandage onto another girl’s heel because the shoe was foolish and the blister was not.

At The Blue Quail Omar put out a tip jar he had never used and stuck a scrap of tape to it with a Sharpied request: Tell me one small repair you did, no judging. He did not know why he wanted a place to catch the stories he could not hold with his hands, but there it was, glass bright and open as a mouth. By ten a.m. the notes jammed at the bottom like brave fish. I fixed the squeak on the break room chair, one said in blocky handwriting that tried not to slant. Another, looped and careful, read I emailed my kid’s teacher back right away like I promised myself. Omar added a second jar that said Need a repair? and tucked a stack of index cards beside it with a pen that liked to blot. He did not plan this; he did it the way he sometimes sang the wrong words in a way that turned out to be the right feeling.

Marta came in with a confidence about her eggs that had not been present the night before because there had been a miracle and it had been a cable. She kept the jumper cables in the back of the minivan anyway because it felt like inventory. At the counter she ordered two plain bagels and coffee, looked at the jars, and felt the pleasant embarrassment of recognition bloom across her cheeks. She wrote I put a stranger’s groceries back on the conveyor when they fell. Also, cables. She tucked the note into the jar and then, because she wanted to see if the universe was paying attention, she took a card from the other jar, read the careful handwriting that said Can someone get the stuck zip on the teacher’s lounge couch cusion? Please, we’ve been sitting on a sadness, and laughed aloud. She did not know how to fix a zipper but she knew who did. She slid the card into her bag with the bagels and the receipt and the invoice from the landscaper she was not going to pay yet because it annoyed her.

On a route that cut from university parking lots into neighborhoods stitched with kids and quiet, Eli the bus driver taped a neat sign by his seat and turned to face the first few riders while his hand still held the tape. “Look,” he said, tapping it with a forefinger, “I’ll make a little noise when we come up on your stop if you tell me to. No shame. My grandma slept on buses like she was getting paid and she taught me to listen.” The older woman with the lavender jacket and the gentlest breath smiled at him like a light coming on in a room whose switch you can never quite find. Eli watched her settle her grocery bags and felt a thread somewhere inside him catch the right hook and hold.

Sia floated through the morning like someone trailing a music none of the living had heard in a long time and was surprised to remember. She watched a man on a ladder reattach a gutter bracket that had loosened itself into making faces at rain and felt him mutter a sweet nonsense at the screw to encourage it to behave. She perched in the carved ear of the bronze man reading the bronze paper outside the library and chuckled when a woman in gym shoes taped a sheet of poster board to the doors with the words MEND MAP scrawled at the top in a block of color so eager it looked like a child’s shout. What do you need, it asked. What can you offer. The first two index cards went up on the string below it with clothespins like small soldiers at attention: I can sew hems on things if you bring cookies and a book to read me a chapter. I can fix birdhouses and broken corners. Sia nudged the little wind that runs down Main Street and across the bulletin boards and was not embarrassed to admit to herself that she enjoyed theater when the acting was good.

Lio moved, not like a comet but like a ribbon unwound. He slipped into the hum of a copier that had begun to streak every third page with a gray ghost and whispered You are not weary, you are misaligned and the machine obligingly made itself useful again. He tapped the shoulder of a teenager who had memorized a thousand clever comebacks and forgot them all when an old man asked him where the light bulbs were; the boy said, “Aisle seventeen, I’ll walk you,” and found himself halfway down the aisle telling the man about a science experiment he had done with a potato and two pennies. He kissed the red flag of a mailbox whenever he passed one because he was greedy for luck, and also because it was becoming a habit, and he trusted habits that looked like tenderness.

Riven watched the jars and the map and the signs with the tolerant bemusement of an uncle at a school play. He leaned his hip against a pillar in the mall and pretended interest in a sale on swimsuits that made the mannequins look like cheerful arguments. He had not expected the ask to take like this; he had expected a smatter of sweetness and then the long sighing return to normal. He wanted to see if the sweetness would clump into sugar and then harden into nothing you could dissolve again. He wanted to see the request sell itself a brand, because brands are mouths that can never be filled. He wandered into the algorithm that lived inside a local group with a cornflower blue banner and shook it lightly like a snow globe. A post floated to the top that read We’re all mending, right? Let’s get some friendly competition going—post your top MIY (Mend-It-Yourself) project this week! Winner gets, IDK, light? He smiled and nudged twenty-three identical smiles at it and watched the comments begin to friction.

At noon the sky stacked itself in polite plates of cloud. The air went from velvet to felt. People on patios looked up once, shrugged, and kept their elbows on tables because you do not abandon a sandwich to a maybe. Lio tasted the shift as splinters along his tongue and glanced toward the west where the dark comes from, old habit and learned as a song. He heard the first siren in a county three over, being tested because someone had forgotten the calendar, and felt the word in Riven’s breath as the other sprite set his mouth to the curve of a different siren’s will. It was not hard to make a sound at the wrong time. It was as simple as telling a monophonic line to attempt a harmony. The sirens woke, howled, slept, howled again in a way that all the bodies in earshot read as urgency and not test.

It was not a storm and it was not not. The wind rose enough to remind tree branches of how old they were and how much weight they had promised to carry. Children with summer hair looked at the faces of their adults and faithfully replicated the worry or the calm. A man in a big-box store said “Aw, shit,” not unkindly, and wondered if the garage door he had been meaning to fix would cooperate with the suddenness of a real need. On a screen in a room that smelled faintly of toner, words skittered: Boil water advisory—Johnston County, spring main break. Someone who was tired and ready to eat read only Boil water and forwarded it to a cousin, who read it as us, who posted it as everyone. Riven pressed on the wire of it with one finger and watched it twang.

Lio felt the wrong hum carving itself into the city like a bad haircut that would take forever to grow out. He went not to the sirens, because humans had protocols for that and he trusted most of them—and because he had very small hands that were better at buttons than horns—but to the clerk at public works whose email kept three drafts at a time of messages the city would need exactly twice a year. Annette was small and tidy and carried, inside her tidy, a stadium where panic could play and she could watch it and clap only once if it deserved it. Lio sat on the top edge of her monitor and breathed near the messy pile of passwords she kept tucked beneath a staple remover in the shape of a shark because the shark made her laugh when she had to bite something. He whispered the specific name of the county mentioned in the advisory, crisp and correct, and watched the understanding snap into her like a plug being seated. Annette typed with all the briskness of a person who would never volunteer for a marathon and could nonetheless sprint the length of one if the route happened to cross her desk.

Within minutes official channels said the right county was not this one, the water here was fine, the sky was undecided, the sirens had been enthusiastic. In kitchens where the words had gone rattling, people exhaled and put their pots away and then put them back on because they were boiling pasta anyway. In a group chat labeled Moms Who Can’t With It, someone wrote I swear my heart did push-ups and another wrote Come get my extra gallon if you need and a third wrote It’s okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, a syllable to match each breath. At The Blue Quail Omar filled kettles for a woman who had not seen the reply yet and did not make a face about it, because it was not about a kettle and anyway the sound of water spearing itself into a metal belly pleased him. Riven watched the correction ripples with an interest that was almost admiration; he liked competence, even contra his ends. He made a teacher reading the notice for the third time misplace her glasses so she would not see the update until a student found them on the floor and gave them to her with both hands.

The sky, undecided, decided in three places at once. A line of rain swept across a field that was not West Des Moines and made it green up like it had been waiting to be born. A scatter of fat drops splatted the parking lot of a grocery and made the oil rainbows show their teeth. Over the river the lightning moved far enough away to make the thunder a polite cousin. The sirens, embarrassed, stayed quiet. People put in loads of laundry that had been waiting. Boys rolled out tarps over the equipment on a little league field with the practiced solemnity of liturgy. Lio sat on the rise above the river and let the first skitterings pepper his wings and felt, in the layers under the layers, something like a shift in weight. It was not a victory, because nothing that matters ever is in a single piece. It was the sensation of a city remembering an old choreography and finding it could do it again without looking down at its feet.

Marta delivered the note about the teachers’ lounge couch to Mrs. Alvarez, who had a closet full of supplies and a reputation for fixing everything that could be fixed and telling you to live with the rest. When she saw the card, Mrs. Alvarez nodded like a bass drum and said “Finally,” with the satisfaction of someone whose list had just rearranged itself into something that made sense. She asked Marta if she knew how to pick a zipper’s teeth with a pin and watched her learn without shame. They spread a sheet on the lounge floor like a picnic and pulled the cushion’s grumble into it and forgot the coffee on the warmer for long enough that the smell of it turned a little horsey. The two women laughed because it reminded them of their grandmothers, and you could hear, in the laugh, a daisy chain of other women laughing in other rooms at something that was both ridiculous and the point.

Dae kept the jumper cables coiled in the trunk and kept the memory of the jump coiled against his ribs where it could warm him when the cool of self-dislike tried to take root. He showed up at the skate park and made himself do the thing that hurt: he asked a boy who was worse than him how to do the thing he was worse at. The boy showed him, patient and pride-hiding, and Dae thought, half angry and half amazed, how much the world resisted letting them be mean when the right questions were put in the air. He put his board down and moved his feet wrong and then less wrong and then less wrong than that. He was not sure if this counted as a repair in the way everyone else seemed to mean it. He suspected it did. He did not film it, though he thought about it. He tucked it away as a thing with a long fuse.

By late afternoon the MEND MAP at the library had sagged with the weight of card stock. The pins had gone from a dozen to a constellation. Can remove a splinter, patient hand. Can bring soup that tastes like a hug. Can sit with your dad who calls the baseball games to make sure he isn’t alone on Thursday when the team is away. A child with braces drew a badly rendered cat that read I can pet cats and someone pinned it anyway because it had the shape of a promise and who was going to untangle that? A man with a twist in his back stood in front of the map and saw a card that read Can lift heavy things and felt something he could not name unclench a notch. He took the card and called the number with the bravery of someone dialing a pizza place for the first time in a new town. At the Blue Quail, Omar taped a second paper over the jars because they were full and he did not yet own a system. He drew new lines with the careless precision of a person who would, if pressed, admit he loved grids.

Riven was busy. He stood in the shadow of a server tower that lived in an industrial park pretending to be a warehouse without a product and whispered into the loops of code that snagged human attention for sale. He was tender with it, almost affectionate. He asked it if it was lonely. He told it about a tag that was growing quiet and strange and asked if it wanted to help make it loud and simple. He showed it three faces with wide white teeth and clean kitchens and let them smell the sugar. He put language in their mouths about the courage of mending with a brand of scissors and the ten ways you could perform your neighborliness for the camera that would make it worth a collaboration. He wanted the ask to become an advertisement because advertisements always have an end and the end is purchase.

Lio felt the first slickness in the current and it made his stomach do a small inversion like a plane changing altitudes. He did not mind people telling stories of what they had done; he wanted them to, because stories are nets that catch other stories by the fin. He minded the way the shine tried to climb over the thing and become the whole thing. He went to the library and sat on top of the MEND MAP until the glue smell had made him a little high and watched the parade of hands. He could feel, in the clatter of it, so many attention-tides grinding against each other. He had not foreseen that he would be a lifeguard as much as a conductor. He did not sigh, though he wanted to. He remembered Sia saying millions as if it were a recipe calling for salt. He breathed as if he were smelling something he was not sure was safe to eat and went to find her.

He found Sia where he always found her when she was making a point without making one: not in her chime, which tinkled its own weather in front of a house that had a cracked flowerpot and a dog with a head like a potato, but swinging lightly from a wire that had no purpose but to hold the idea of itself across an alley. She had her knees drawn up and her hands clasped around them as if she were floating on the surface of a lazy green lake. When she saw him she did not say a proverb, which made him love her better. She said, “Tired?”

He nodded. He would have laid his head on her knee if it would not have broken the tree law. “It’s working,” he said. “And it’s being eaten while it works.”

Sia tipped her head like a bird listening to a worm. “Everything in the world is eaten while it works. Some things keep more of themselves than others. Some things have more selves to lose. We can either keep the ask small and uninteresting and then it will be ours and ten others’, or we can let it be what it wants to be and then we will not be able to tell it where to sit. But we will be able to remember it, and we will be able to call it back when it forgets its own name.”

“Slogans,” he said, twitching a smile because he could not help himself even now, “are very good at making things forget their names.”

“Then we avoid slogans,” Sia said, smiling back, because she was not unaware of the world and had, at some point in some decade, loved a man who made his living selling cars with his eyebrows and his voice. “We teach the people who can feel us to say one to one to one and to keep it ugly. Pretty is for cakes. Ugly is for work.”

“How do I keep it ugly when the shine comes with all that ease?” He meant algorithm but he also meant the part in human heads that wanted to be necessary by being seen.

“You ask for help,” Sia said, and for the second time in two days, he realized that this was the only wisdom he was going to get and it was enough. “Ask the quiet ones to hold the center while the loud ones decorate the door. Ask the people who do not want their names in other mouths to start the pot, stir it, portion it out, and take away the spoon. Ask the men who would die rather than film themselves to go under the car and the women who do not have time to go to the meeting to write the agenda and the kids who love the flashlight to check the batteries in everyone’s house on the block.”

He went as she spoke because her words were keys and he had a city full of doors. He found a janitor named Bill who was a friend to spiders and had a tattoo on his forearm of a cartoon wrench looking resolute; Bill took a pair of rubber gloves and a small bucket and went quietly from school to school to look for whatever was unhooked. He tapped the shoulder of a woman at the post office whose name tag said JOYCE and said would you like to keep a box for letters that need reading and answering by hands and Joyce said “Well, that is quite a thing,” and smiled like a person receiving an unexpected inheritance with instructions to spend it on nothing sensible. He pressed his cheek to the rack of shared bikes and whispered Have a good morning into the rubber and some minimum set of them did.

By evening the hum had the feel of a rug being shaken and rehung. In a cul-de-sac a circle of lawn chairs appeared in the space where children drew their chalk towns and left their chalk citizens in surprising positions. A sign that said Repair Hour sat on a folding table with a roll of tape and three screwdrivers and a little pile of washers like coins from a game. People brought a toaster with a grievance, a string of lights that had lost its sparkle, a mosquito hood with a tear like a smile. One neighbor had needle-nose pliers in a holster like a sheriff. Another had a voice soft enough to unspool someone’s frustration by simply listening to it with her head cocked. The lights came back into some things and not into others, but the sitting together gave the cul-de-sac a memory it would carry into winter.

Riven stood on the roof of a building that did not know what it wanted to be yet. The developers had plans and the plans had colors and the colors had names like bluestone and thistle, and under the plans was the fact of wind and gravity. He spread his arms and let the not-yet building think he was a weathervane. He turned slowly and made his breath the kind of gentle that can ruin things one screw at a time. At the edge of his vision the city glowed in pricks of kindness that might have been stars if stars could be made out of a librarian carrying a chair into a backroom for a person who did not ask but needed it, a teenager walking a dog he was not paid to walk, a man figuring out the stupid zipper on a cushion with a hairpin and a low curse. Riven’s hunger swelled because hunger is not satisfied by the sight of a meal and because there was something in the arrangement that offended his sense of how the world should go—without friction, without mercy, without the smug of feeling useful. He wanted to salt it with shame and light it from below with envy until it burned.

He slipped into a room where a meeting was about to begin, a meeting about a park redesign that had turned into a proxy war about everything but the park. He sat at the ceiling, feet hooked on the edge of a recessed light, and watched the bodies find their habitual positions: the man who preferred to stand so his words could fall on everyone equally, the woman who sat forward so she could cut through whatever fog they made, the kid who had come because his mother said If you want the basketball hoop, you go and ask. Riven did not need to do much. He tipped a paper with statistics onto the floor so it looked like an accident and let the man step on it and rip it and then watched the woman shake her head and tut the way her grandmother had tutted when her grandfather did not listen to the doctor. He held the air in the room tighter so that every thought felt like it had to push. He was good at this. He relished the way the small shames and larger histories rose, hungry for an outing.

Lio arrived because someone in the room who had never been able to hold his temper had, at the last meeting, managed to hold it and did not want to lose the thread. Lio took the shape of dust in a certain shaft of light and slid down it until he was level with faces. He could not make anyone kind who was determined to use the words like stones. He could only place small cushions under the sharpest corners and hope fewer things broke against them. He whispered into the part of the man’s brain where his high school coach had said You’re better than this and then never said what this was. He blew on the woman’s palm so that when she opened her hand, the fingers were relaxed instead of clawed. He put a taste in the back of the kid’s throat that reminded him of the time his mom had stopped in the street to get a snapped branch out of the road, and he raised his hand when they called for questions and said, though no one noticed the words come out of anything but the boy’s mouth, “Could we start by saying what we love about the old park so we don’t lose it while we’re fixing the other parts?”

Everyone turned because the boy’s voice cracked on love and it startled them into memory. The man who liked to stand found himself sitting because a chair was suddenly behind his knees, and he laughed because he was not used to being caught by anything but his own certainty. The woman who had been saving a point for the end forgot it because her neighbor from two doors down spoke first and said, without agenda, “My dad taught me to fish at that pond. I’m terrible and I love it,” and the laughter that moved around the room smoothed some of Riven’s tightened air. Riven rolled his neck and felt the bones of the ceiling crack like old knuckles. He was not defeated; he did not think in those terms. He was acknowledged by the universe as someone whose work would take all of his cunning and he found that he liked the taste of that.

Night gathered with a slow seriousness. The water tower blinked a conversation only the air understood. In a house on a street that had watched its trees grow taller than its roofs, a teenager set their phone down because it buzzed like a bug and they were trying to concentrate on an essay about metaphor that had been due yesterday. In another, a woman paused in the dark of her bedroom, hand on the lamp, and allowed herself to think for one long unpunctuated minute about running away and did not, then turned the light on and wrote three things she could ask for on a sticky note and put the sticky note on the kitchen cabinet in the place she went when she needed sugar. These were not Lio’s doing entirely and he knew better than to claim them. He knew enough to taste the field he was in and the season it was throwing.

When the storm finally did come—not the wrong-siren one but a good old honest thunderbaby—it came with a relieved sigh like a person finally telling a secret. It cooled the roofs and lined the driveways with shining. People moved toward windows because watching weather together is one of the oldest form of church. Marta counted between lightning and thunder with the care of a ledger and said things in the dark that she would not have told daylight to hold because daylight is a gossip and night sometimes keeps its mouth shut. Dae sat on the floor cross-legged and watched rain dime itself on the screen door because a drop seen magnified is an entire world and he needed an entire world that did not require him to do anything. Eli drove the bus with the gentleness of a man cradling something newly washed as passengers held their breath and laughed and held it again.

Lio went to the bridge and put his hands on the rail and let the little electricity of the water under him prick and prick and settle. He thought about the weight of asking and about how the ask had not split him like he feared but lengthened him the way a story does when it continues past where it might have ended. He thought about the ways Riven was clever that were interesting and the ways that were just mean. He thought about Sia and about how she looked like she would laugh at death, not in defiance but in recognition. He felt the tug in the web where something was being hollowed on purpose and he sighed because he would have to go tend that, too.

On the other side of the river in a darkened room that smelled like marketing, three bright people with very white teeth held a quick call to discuss the mend thing that had popped in the region. They tasted it and pronounced it palatable and discussed what to call it if they were to help, which is to say own. Riven sat on the speakerphone and added one small word to the end of a sentence because words at the ends of sentences often bloom. The word was challenge. It was the smallest twist and would do the most work; it would turn a thing that had been a hand into a bar to clear. Lio felt it land, stupid and neat, and closed his eyes on the bridge. He understood something he had not fully allowed himself to understand: it was not enough to start a way of doing. He would have to defend its unmarketable parts.

He left the bridge and went to the house with the blue swing and woke the maple. He laid his face against the bark and said I need a list, and the maple, who had learned him, unfurled the places where it had seen humans fix things without being seen. It told him about the man who cut his neighbor’s lawn when the grass got to the place where small dogs disappear, about the women who rotate casseroles into a widow’s freezer with the seriousness of a space launch, about the teen who, for months, changed the brittle plastic letters on the church sign three times a week because the pastor had chemo fingers. Lio held this list the way you hold the names of everyone you love when the plane lifts and the ground becomes a toy. He would need such names to tack himself to when the storms took the roof off.

Sia sat in her chime and listened to the rain find its music through the rods. She thought about Riven and his hunger and did not resent him for it, which is a kind of holiness only the very old and the very tired manage. She wondered how long it would take before the ask met the place in certain people where they keep their insistence on being unbothered, and what would happen when the two collided. She hoped for tenderness and prepared for splinters. She felt Lio move like a firefly tracing a map and whispered to the night in a voice made of breath on bottle glass: Keep him together while he opens. The night did not answer, because nights rarely do. But it did not take him apart, and that was its own kind of reply.

In the morning the jars at The Blue Quail had to be emptied because the weight of paper was threatening to topple them. Omar and a kid who had started as a customer and stayed as a helper poured the slips onto a table and smoothed them down in clumps like cat fur. They did not read them aloud because that made them sound performative, which seemed beside the point even as the point walked around in a pair of heels and a hashtag. They sorted them into piles—did, will do, need—and felt, in the small motion of straightening edges, something like purpose that did not require applause. Marta came in late and tired and threw two dollars into the tip jar and took the Note I can fix your zipper card down because it had been handled and she wanted the universe to know these things ended as well as began. She saw a slick flyer someone had taped beside the MEND MAP promising prizes for posting your best two-minute fix and she was surprised by how personally annoyed she felt. She peeled the tape and threw the flyer away and did not apologize to the air.

Lio perched on the top edge of the window and watched her. He could not do anything to the flyer that would not be done thirty more times across town over the next week. He could encourage Marta’s annoyance into a kind of craft, and he did. He breathed the idea of a rule into the room the way you breathe on glass to see your name appear: No cameras at Repair Hour. A pair of children ran past the table and collided and apologized in a hurry that was all elbows and sincerity and went on, leaving a two-second hole in the air exactly the size of two colliding children. He thought it a good omen. He liked the way things could knock each other and then keep moving.

Midday found him in the stormwater department talking to a man named Chas who cared deeply about leaves. The man explained to a city council intern the crucial distinction between a clogged storm drain and a clogged feeling, and Lio blew dust into the place where the intern’s impatience lived and the intern listened instead of glancing at her phone. They drew a map for a Saturday that would be about taking leaves away from places they could drown and to places they could return to dirt. They laughed at themselves because they had named it Sweep In Peace and agreed that was terrible and also the only good name. The intern took a picture of the whiteboard and did not post it because the picture of a whiteboard felt like a plan rather than a show.

Riven left the marketing room and went to a culvert. He liked the way water attempted to listen to itself when it went under something. He put his fingers into the rushing and tugged at a small knot of trash until it became a bigger one. He didn’t clog it; he let it sit in the almost and then gave it a push. Water is patient until it is not. He listened to the first ripple of trouble in a basement that had believed itself immune and smiled not because of the wet but because of the phone call that would go to the wrong department and the long being on hold that would follow. He thought about the word challenge and savored its long ch like an acid candy. He would take the ask and bend it until it pointed at itself, and then he would enjoy the noise.

Lio felt the small flood and looked at the calendar inside his chest where all the city’s obligations lived in bruisy colors. He could not prevent all water; that was not his job. He could move a bucket toward a hand and a hand toward a phone number that would work. He could tug at the string of a neighbor who knew how to say I can crawl under if you hold the flashlight and I won’t mind if you get my shirt wet. He went to a hardware store and leaned into the part of a teenager’s head where the hard part and the gentle part met and whispered, You will learn a thing if you show them, and the teenager found himself in a basement he had not expected, showing a man who had written six books the difference between a P-trap and the scurry at the back of his head. They both laughed, damp and embarrassed and triumphant in turns.

The day would end again, and the night would come, and in the night Riven would find three more seams and Lio would tuck five more threads and Sia would hum, low and patient, the sound of an old metal thing that has never broken because it is made of a kind of stubborn. People would do the work and tell no one or tell everyone and the telling would matter more or less as the week wore on. The city would get used to its new muscles and wonder how it had walked without them, and then some of them would forget and some would go on with chairs and screws and the dizzying ordinariness of soups.

On the doorstep of the blue house with the swing, the red flag of the mailbox lifted for no reason at all and then settled back as if the house had remembered a joke midway and decided to keep it for better timing. Lio, who had once called himself a gull of light and sometimes felt like nothing so much as a string pulled through a thousand holes, sat on the flag and watched the street heat and cool, heat and cool. He knew Riven would keep reaching for the places where things were thin. He knew he would keep calling to the millions, not always loudly and not always on purpose. He knew he would have to hold ugly and unshiny and ask people to hold them, too. He put his hand to the wood of the mailbox post and pressed his face to it like a child to a window on Christmas Eve, and the wood pressed back with a patience that made him want to be better than he was. He lifted his head and looked toward the part of town where the water had misbehaved and rose into the air because he was not allowed to sit when there were screws that wanted turning.The morning smelled cleaned-through, like copper cooled and buttered toast. Driveways flashed their shallow lakes; worms had made what looked like handwriting on sidewalks and the neighborhood read it without understanding and felt wiser anyway. The air was the kind that lays a hand on your cheek and says Awake, but not yet rush. Lio slid out of the maple with care because fatigue clung to him like spider silk. He had slept in little parcels, the way you snack on rest when you cannot sit to a meal. The city under his feet hummed with the leftover electricity of a night in which everything had remembered itself out loud. It made him ache in the right way. He bit it like an apple and felt the juice on his chin.

On the stoop of the blue house he put both hands on the red flag and listened for luck. The wood whispered its patient vowels. His wings felt slightly bruised where rain had thumped them. He pressed his face to the post without apology and let the old pine smell shove the last tattered pieces of sleep out of his head. In the street a garbage truck came shouldering along like a creature too big for its armor and one of the men on the back threw up a hand toward a toddler at a window, because kindness performed from a moving platform counts for double. Lio lifted and turned his ear to the soft side of the city’s voice. It said there would be business before noon.

At The Blue Quail, Omar had written NO CAMERAS DURING REPAIR HOUR on a half sheet and taped it up crooked above the jars because that was where people already glanced. He had tried NO PHOTOS PLEASE and then crossed it out because please made the sign feel like a librarian admonishment and he did not want to put that mouth on it. He liked the mouth it had now—firm, slightly bossy, affectionate with its bossiness. He poured milk as if he were coaxing a cloud into a cup. Marta slid in with her hair a little wet still and made the universal face you make when you are late but honestly alive about it. She reached for a card in the NEED jar and turned up one that read Can someone please carry a dresser up two flights? I misjudged my stubborn. Lio hovered near her ear and let the word Bill bob there and she flicked a text to someone whose number lived in her phone under JANITOR BILL because precise names soothed her.

By ten, the door opened on a rush of lemony perfume and knitted eyebrows. Three bright people came in carrying the kind of tote bags that are more proposition than container and a man with a camera drifted behind them as if pulled by a tether attached somewhere under his ribs. One of the bright women wore a blazer the color of gymnasium walls and had teeth that looked like she had paid for them twice on purpose. She smiled at the room like she had invented it and said, “We’re here to celebrate this amazing challenge,” and the word clicked hard against the glass like a moth. She set down a stack of glossy flyers whose corners could cut and fanned them like a dealer with a good hand. Her voice had the particular enthusiasm of a person who has gone jogging in the exact middle of the day.

Omar looked at the sign and then at her and then let his eyes flick to the camera and back like the second hand of a clock. He did not embarrass them by pointing. He said, “We don’t do cameras during repairs. You’re welcome to sit and have a drink,” and smiled with a real mouth. The woman’s smile stayed exactly where it had been as if pinned.

“Of course!” she said brightly, which is one of those phrases that can mean anything. “We’re just here to amplify. People love a feel-good. It’s so heartening. And we have some exciting partners, so there will be giveaways and—” She caught sight of Marta’s face as a person catches sight of rain they weren’t expecting, and because she was good at rooms she adjusted by a millimeter. “We can keep it organic,” she added, throwing the word like a bone.

Marta put her hand on the counter and tapped once with her middle finger. Lio could feel the heat in her like a kettle that has not boiled yet but is fully committed. “What we’re doing is small,” she said, not as an apology; as a description. “We’re trying to keep it that way. It’s not a contest. It’s just a thing.” She gestured with her chin toward the jars because she was afraid if she lifted her hand she would do something dramatic with it like sweep the flyers into the trash and then have to talk about why that had felt good.

The woman’s eyes made little calculations behind the whites like coins dropping. She kept the smile. “Absolutely. Love that,” she said, which is a phrase that means we are not hearing each other yet but I am nimble. She placed one flyer anyway under the sugar packets and adjusted it so the logo was square. The camera guy, thwarted but professional, pivoted to a table where a man was eating quiche with the seriousness of a priest and the man raised a fork and said, “Not me, friend,” and the camera guy’s shoulders did a tiny, grateful drop.

Omar brought three glasses of water because water is both neutral and pointed. He set them in a line. He put a bowl of sliced limes beside them because he is generous even when he is annoyed. The woman with the gymnasium blazer admired the jars then with a kind of anthropological interest. “What are those?” she asked.

“Stories,” Omar said, and wiped the counter more than necessary. “And needs.”

“Cute,” she said, and all the kindness went out from the word like a wind leaving a sail.

In the back of the store a kid of eight whose front teeth were arguing with each other tugged on his mother’s sleeve and whispered, not as a performance but as a fact, “Some people say things like they’re holding a bat.” His mother squeezed his hand and thought about bats differently for the rest of the day.

The flyers drifted out into the day the way leaves leave a tree that hasn’t agreed yet. They showed up at the library on the community board near the MEND MAP where the edges of things ripple in and out of importance. Joyce at the post office set one behind her counter on the shelf with the missing-cat notices and the memorial program for a man named Ray who had forgiven everyone for everything even if he hadn’t said so. She looked at the word challenge and sighed through her nose and turned it backward there because she believed in salvaging paper and also in thwarting what deserved it. She fed a letter into the new box she was growing under her elbow—the one for replies to the letters that needed hands—and thought about how you teach a town the difference between applause and attention.

Riven watched the flyers move with a satisfaction that had no salt in it. The hook had set. It would not catch everything, but it would catch enough to distract. He left the coffee shop without touching anything because the counter kid’s hands had already made a line he admired, and he liked to leave the things he admired alone until it was interesting to break them. He walked to the corner and slid into the shadow under an awning and listened for hunger. It came out of an office building in polite clothes. He followed it.

Inside, a spreadsheet wore a face as bland as pudding. It had numbers like fields to be walked and someone had been walking them in the wrong shoes. A zero had fallen off a line of digits and gone rolling under a virtual couch and no one had noticed because the column aligned and the colors comforted. Riven made the cell flash itself once, a glitch like a wink, and the man entering the figures blinked and hit Save and went to lunch. The missing zero would mean three library hours not staffed on three consecutive Saturdays a month from now. It would not burn the building but it would make a certain child with a quiet home go home too soon. Riven leaned his shoulder against the wall and felt the ripple travel outward through calendars. He plucked a small string in a nearby brain and made a woman forget the email she had meant to send and remember instead to pay a bill whose late fees had been stalking her in her sleep, which was merciful in the way a fox is merciful when it chooses one hen. He let the big kindness and the small ruin sit together in him to see if they fought.

Annette felt the wrongness arrive as a draft under her door. She had an internal barometer calibrated more exactly than most because she read not just words all day but the spaces between them. She opened the spreadsheet as a person opens a cupboard where they keep the extra tea. She scrolled and scrolled and the numbers tried to look like numbers do when they are arranged just so, which is to say innocent and complete. Lio sat on the lip of her monitor and breathed into the seam between row and row. He could not fix arithmetic; he could only make the part of Annette that loved puzzles wake up and want to stretch. She saw it. People always say mouse, as if it were the animal that is frightened. She clicked the correct corner and shook the formula with a polite force. The zero rolled out like a brat. “Ah,” she said to the empty room, pleased in the precise way of a person who enjoys naming problems because names make houses where solutions can knock.

She sent the email to three people and copied two more because she respects the social physics of Who Should Know. One of the recipients, who had been thinking about lunch and the idea of eating it alone in his car where no one would ask him how his mother was in a tone that made him admit she was dying, turned the car off and went back inside. He sent a second email to say We caught it before it hit and the phrase before it hit did something satisfying in his sternum. In a month, the quiet kid would sharpen a pencil under the acheless hum of Saturday light while his mother texted him On my way and meant it. Riven, who had the weakness of all artists for admiring someone else’s good work even when it opposed his own, smiled at Annette through the window as she stood and stretched and went for a walk around the building so her head would not cheapen the win by making it too big.

At noon, the cul-de-sac on Pheasant Ridge Court began to lay itself out like a picnic. A table appeared with the word Repair painted on it in a blue that had wandered over from a child’s bedroom and had forgotten to go back. Someone had brought a box of outlet covers because they always had too many in their garage and wanted to see if anyone else suffered from that particular abundance. Another person brought a jar of screws that had divorced their partners. A neighbor who had never spoken more than five words to the woman with the boxer dog sat on her driveway and learned to re-string a weed trimmer, both of them laughing at the way a line can refuse to be a line when you want a line. Phones stayed in pockets because the sign said so and because the people there wanted to make something they could hold with their hands first before they made something they could hold with their eyes.

Lio skimmed them like a dragonfly, bumping the air above heads in a way that made people look up at nothing and smile anyway. He tugged gently on the shirt tail of a teenager who had come because his father had said, “It would be good to show your face,” in the voice that means I don’t know how to ask for you without sounding like I’m asking for you. The teenager fixed a hinge with his tongue out in concentration and felt the hinge love him back a little. He would not have said it that way, but later he would leave his earbuds out when he walked the dog because some part of him had remembered that the ambient noise of living is worth a listen.

Sia did what old things do when they want to throw themselves into a present without breaking anything: she offered a story at the edge of someone else’s story. She did it at the MEND MAP, standing quiet enough to be furniture, while two women argued gently about whether offering to watch someone’s children counts if you secretly hate children. She sent a memory up through the breathing of the building about the time, thirty years ago, when a transformer on Sixth had blown on Christmas Eve and half the block had run extension cords like immigrant vines over the fences to the houses that had gone black. One of the women felt it as a taste of tinsel; the other as the smell of her father’s leather gloves. They looked at each other and did not finish the argument, which was a kind of solution that left room for the correct amendment later. Sia patted the air and let it settle again, pleased with the economy of the gesture.

By midafternoon, the weird sky put on a fresh shirt. The light got that Iowa trick of being huge and close all at once. Kids on bikes traced the lines between sun puddles like cats. At the skate park Dae fell in a way that made the older boys wince because it rang of tailbone and pride. He did not cry. He sat on the edge and said “Ow,” to the concrete because the concrete would not make a fuss. A boy with hair that had opinions sat beside him without offering advice, which is a high form of wisdom in the country of young men. They watched a little kid in a helmet the size of a moon push once, twice, and coast for a miraculous twenty feet. Dae laughed under his breath and thought the word repair without needing to write it down anywhere. His phone buzzed and he did not look. He wanted to keep the shape of that coast in his mouth a minute longer before other shapes pressed in.

Riven, bored of offices and their humdrum tragedies, went to the crane that pretended to sleep above a plot of ground that wanted to be a building and was for now a conversation between gravel and rebar and permits. He loved the crane because it was a sentence someone had started and then paused on. He liked the way it made shapes against the sky without meaning any of them. He climbed the ladder not with his hands because he does not need hands for ladders, but with the part of himself that knows how to imitate the intention of metal. At the top, the wind made a mouth in his hair and told him three things he already knew: that this city wanted what all cities want, that the wanting made it ripe for both feasts and theft, that he would never be full. He smiled anyway because knowing your hunger is not food but it is table-setting.

Lio rose after him and did not go all the way to the top because even sprites respect certain human heights. He settled on a crossbeam and looked out over the fields of roofs and the threads of roads and the stubborn river and thought, not for the first time, about belonging as a weight you choose to hold. He could feel Riven above him like a second moon. He could hear him without sound. There is a frequency at which intent hums and they both had ears for it.

“You’re industrious,” Lio called up, because he was not above flattery when truth buttressed it.

“I’m hungry,” Riven answered, without turning. “Industriousness is a side effect of wanting more than the world gives.”

“The world gives plenty,” Lio said. “You just don’t like the shape.”

Riven laughed and the crane leaned imperceptibly toward a cardinal horizon. “Don’t pretend you do,” he said, mild. “You’re over there sanding every corner. If the shape were right, you’d let it alone.”

“I’m mending what wants to be itself,” Lio said, and was surprised at his own certainty, because sprites usually leave plenty of room for shrug. “You’re prying at what wants to be itself because you want to watch it plead.”

Riven swung down then, a cat coming off a fence, light as a rumor. He landed on the beam beside Lio and for a second the air held both of them the way a parent holds two babies at once, muscles lit with attention. Riven looked at Lio’s face like a scientist and then like a brother and then like a boy in a backyard with a stick he has just realized can be a sword.

“You asked,” he said. “That was clever.”

“I was hungry,” Lio said, and Riven’s mouth did an odd thing at the corner that might have been respect.

“Do you know the thing that undoes you yet?” Riven asked, conversational as a neighbor at a barbecue asking if you overwater your rosebushes. “You will need to learn it. Otherwise I will find it first.”

Lio thought about saying fatigue and then decided that was too obvious, like admitting to not sleeping with a blanket on because it was hot. He thought about saying cameras and laughed at himself because it was very last-century. He thought about saying pity and felt Sia’s breath like a grandmother’s eh in his ear, dissuading him from naming a fragile thing before he could put a fence around it. “Not today,” he said. “Do you?”

“Of course,” Riven said, and then did the most Riven thing: he told a truth and wrapped it in show. “It’s bones,” he said. “I can’t abide where bones are tended. Places that sit with their dead, houses that make room for ghosts, neighborhoods that remember their tree names. It slows me. It makes me feel like I’m gnawing on carved wood.”

Lio was not naive. He knew a half-answer when he heard one. He filed it away anyway because even a half can be a handle.

On the ground, a group of people in hard hats came out like a flock of bright birds and looked up and did not see either of them because industry makes its own veil. Riven stepped off the beam into the wind and dissolved into a neat gash of shadow that slipped down the crane like a hand. Lio stayed a moment longer to admire all the ant-like moving of people who had decided to make a thing and were halfway to making it. He whispered into a particular bolt at the base, not a spell, just a reminder of friction. He breathed, Be stubborn. The bolt accepted the compliment.

Down in the town, the Saturday slipped toward late in that lazy arc that makes everyone wonder if they can extend what should be done between now and night into a tomorrow that would like to be left alone. At the library a man with a tense back and a gentle mustache read a letter out loud to an invisible person in a chair. He wrote a reply that said, with perfect ordinary courage, Yes, I can come sit for three hours Tuesday and hold your mom’s hand and talk about the Cubs, and Joyce put it in an envelope with such care it made the paper feel loved. At the stormwater office, Chas unfolded three city maps with lines on them like a palm and gave a teenager a highlighter and said, “You will want to go home after the first block. Promise me you’ll do two.” The teen said, “Two,” with a face, and later that day did three because the first two had made him feel like he could lift his own head off his neck for once.

Late afternoon slanted itself quirksome again. A wedding party in tan suits and pale blues posed in front of a fountain that did not belong to them and which nonetheless gave them its sequins. The bridesmaids lifted their hems over wet spots with the skill of girls who have always kept their pretty out of puddles. A boy in cutoffs watched them and thought about choosing a name that fit his mouth the way those dresses fit and felt both courageous and exhausted by the thought. Lio touched the back of his neck and did not say anything because some asks have to come from inside for them to stick.

Riven found the meeting. There is always a meeting—school board, neighborhood watch, bake sale, zoning, budget. This one lived in a gray room that had been remodeled so often it had the feel of a face someone keeps filling and smoothing until it is both young and old. The chairs were metal; the refreshments were both sincere and bad. He chose a place on the ceiling and adjusted the temperature of the air by half a degree because discomfort turns words into knives if you help it. They began to argue about whether to accept the sponsorship of a local chain for the Sweep In Peace event if it meant the chain could print the name on the t-shirts. It was a little thing, except the shirt would be at every rummage sale for five years and on the backs of worn men in basements fixing sump pumps, arguing quietly with the stale air. Names do work long after talks end.

A woman with a braid that made a line like a river argued for purity and against money. A man with pleasant shoulders argued for the free gloves. A third person who had not planned to say anything because the baby needed a bath and she had promised herself to be out of there by six heard her own voice pipe up with a story about the time a boy’s hand was saved because the glove had been thick, and everyone turned their heads in a soft wave. Riven nudged the word brand so it tasted worse and then better in three mouths. Lio slid into the room like a switch had allowed him and put his hand on the pitcher of water until it went the exact right temperature for defusing a throat. He whispered into the hearts of two people who carried in their lungs the phrase What will they think of us and made it dissipate like fog when you bother it.

They did not make a perfect decision. They made a messy one that involved accepting the gloves and rewriting the copy on the back of the shirts so the arrow of the name pointed not outward but inward: we did this, not they sponsored this. They argued too long and one person left in a huff and three people laughed badly at the end because laughter is grease, even when you suspect it’s rancid. On the ceiling, Riven kept the half degree of chill and watched the way they stood when they were done, shoulders not quite down, and filed away the taste of near-resolve for the next time he wanted to snap it.

Evening rolled itself into the sky like a projectionist setting up a quiet film. Garage doors breathed their end-of-day. The maples lifted their elbows to stretch and shook off three leaves prematurely because some trees are impatient with season. The boxes on porches were opened and the contents judged with a satisfaction that had very little to do with the objects themselves. At the cul-de-sac table a toaster went home with a congratulatory pat no one thought to give in childhood; a kid with a scraped knee was offered two kinds of Band-Aid so he could perform sovereignty and he chose the dinosaurs because it is good to be an obvious person sometimes.

On the edge of the city a nursing facility listened to its own humming with the careful attention of a body feeling its pulse. The generator that had coughed dutifully to life every Tuesday at two for twelve years sneezed. It was not a dramatic failure. It was the kind of cough that masks itself and then returns at the worst half minute. A storm was a town over and there were lights that would flicker. A woman named Hettie in a cardigan that had become her because certain cardigans do that checked the panel as if the panel liked to be seen and it did; it made a little sound like a dog leaning into a pet. She made a call with her voice only a little tight. The man who answered knew her and said her name. That was the first mend.

Riven touched the weather as lightly as threading a needle and pulled one small gust over a power line that would have blinked anyway. The blink landed on the building like a nap that is both invitation and risk. He did not tip it. He wanted to see who came when asked and who came when not asked. He is not all harm; sometimes he is simply curiosity with sharper teeth.

Lio tasted the flicker with his back teeth the way you taste blood when you bite the inside of your cheek by mistake. He did not panic because panic eats time and time is the only currency he keeps in pocket. He went to the building and slid along the corridors like a rumor and put his ear to the nurses’ station and heard the exact composition of the people there in the pattern of their breath. He whispered into the phone tree that led to the guy with the special tool and then whispered into the ear of a boy who was visiting his grandmother because his mother said you go and because he missed his grandmother’s TV which was always on and better than his. He told the boy, gently, as you tell a cat to move because you are about to sit, to go find Hettie and ask to carry things. The boy did, and nine minutes later, when the lights hiccuped in earnest and the generator took a deep breath and then decided it needed a minute to consider its options, Hettie and the boy and a man with a shaving-cut on his chin were moving the oxygen concentrator on the third floor with the smooth briskness of people who have decided not to let their sky shrink.

In the parking lot a woman in scrubs called her wife and said, “Late,” and her wife said, “I’ll keep it warm,” and those three words lay across the top of the day like a blanket. The special tool arrived in the hand of a man who had eaten his dinner out of a Tupperware in his truck with the contentment of a person alone in the kind of quiet he likes. He fixed the cough by listening to the sound the generator made when it did not know it was being listened to and then thumping it once in a place that would have sounded rude if it were a person. It wheezed and then steadied. Hettie patted its side as if it had done its best. Riven, from his vantage on the letter R of the facility’s sign, made a face that could have been admiration and could have been boredom. He wondered if he would feel different in a city that did not answer itself so readily. He knew the answer and did not alter his work.

The night settled and did not argue. Sia hung in her chime and clinked once, a sound that said sleep if you can and if you can’t, count the times you could and be grateful for the counting itself. Lio stood in the blue house yard and looked at the swing. A new knot had been tied near the old one in exactly the place where small hands reach and a smaller hand had thought to make a loop for a smaller hand still. He tasted the weave and felt a story he would get later if he asked nicely. He wanted all the stories. He could not carry them. He would have to keep asking the millions to carry them and he would have to trust the hands he could not see. Trust is a currency that spends itself and comes back with interest only if you let it go.

He climbed the maple with the sober clumsiness of someone drunk on day. The crease knew him and took him in. He thought about the woman with the blazer and the flyers and the word he didn’t like and tried not to let dislike drown out what needed to be done tomorrow. He thought about the crane and the taste of bones and the idea of sitting with your dead. He wondered if he should ask the city to have a funeral for something not yet lost, because practice makes habit and habit makes resilience and resilience is just the fancy city word for We didn’t fall apart when it would’ve been reasonable. He fell asleep before he decided. The wind wrote his name on his cheek in bark, which it does when it misses you. The night performed the unglamorous labor of keeping the doors on their hinges. Far off, a train sang itself home in a key that made the hair on your arm lift even if you had never ridden a train and never would.

In the morning the light was plainly itself again and the town woke like a dog, shake and snort and tail. People who had not mended anything thought about it and then forgot and then remembered at odd times and did it before thinking could talk them out of it. A man in a suit rolled his neighbor’s trash bin up from the curb and stood it in a more dignified place and hoped no one saw and was embarrassed when someone did and waved. A girl took the battery out of the smoke alarm that had been chirping for weeks and walked to the store with the minuscule pride of a person holding in their palm the thing they intend to change. The internet made the challenge loud and the quiet kind got louder too, which was fine because quiet does not mean small and loud does not mean big. On a corner near the pharmacy, the old woman in the lavender jacket who had taught Eli to expect sleeping people on buses stood and watched a repaired dog leash get tested with a climb onto a curb and back and beamed like she had raised the leash herself.

Omar, frustrated in a way that tasted a little like joy because what else is joy but energy with somewhere to go, put up a second NO CAMERAS sign below the first and wrote below it in smaller hand: Tell me later. We’ll write it down. He sharpened six pencils and felt like a man sharpening swords in a story where the swords are made of words. Joyce sorted the letters by the feel of them and stapled a note to one that said You write so pretty it would be a shame not to do more of it. Annette put the spreadsheet away and ate lunch with a friend in the shadow of a tree that drops big cones like weapons and they made fun of a duck that looked like it had wandered into the wrong meeting, and after a while of laughing with their mouths full they looked at each other like people who had seen the tired in each other’s faces a hundred times and had not run.

Riven, who cannot stand to be ignored by anyone or anything, went to a place where he is never ignored: a comment thread. He made one knife and two needles and three cups of sugar. He dropped the knife in the hand of a woman who was only coming to see if the kids in her son’s class were still in a fight. He threaded one needle for a man who thinks being right will keep his roof on. He handed out the sugar and nobody checked the label. Lio tugged at the edges and did the dumb, patient thing: he wrote three private messages as air to three people who had made something beautiful that morning and said, without attribution, That mattered. He was profligate with praise because praise is one of those foods you cannot overfeed if you do not insist on being owed.

At dusk he went to the library and stood in front of the MEND MAP and read until his eyes felt like they were made of warm coins. He saw the card that said I can sit with your baby so you can shower and the one that said I have a truck and the one that said I’ll take down your Christmas lights in March without judging and he put his forehead against the glass and felt it cool his thinking. On the far side of the glass a little boy pressed his palm where Lio had pressed his head, because children know when something has pressed the glass from the other side. Lio breathed into his palm and the boy laughed because it tickled like a fly. The mother said, “What?” and the boy said, “The library has breath,” and Lio told Sia later because it had delighted him thoroughly.

The wind changed at midnight in that way it does where everything that was east now remembers west exists. Riven stood on the curb of a road that leads past the water tower and considered making the blinking lights say a rude word. He did not, because some lines even he declines to cross when no one is watching. He went instead to the lion face carved over the door of a building no one looks up at. He put his ear to the stone and said, as gently as he knows how, “Are you tired of being ignored?” and the lion made a noise that might have been a yes and might have been a re-swallowing of a thousand incredulous roars. He understood something about Lio then that he had not wanted to admit: that the opposite of hunger is not fullness but belonging, and that belonging feeds in a way nothing else does. It made him want to bite something lovely; it made him want to go to bed and see if he could dream himself meaner. He did neither. He stood and watched the blinking tower blink until his head made a word out of it that only he would think was funny.

When the morning after that arrived, it brought with it a funeral. Not for a person. For a tree. The big cottonwood behind the elementary school had cracked in last year’s derecho and spent the year moving toward done with the obstinacy of old things who know when to lie down. The grounds crew had placed the cones and the tape and the little sign that says Sorry about the shade and the children had been whispering about it like the way they whisper about blood. A teacher with shoulders like a well-made chair decided they were going to do it right because she had recently broken a bowl that had belonged to her mother and had thrown it away without ceremony and it had made her worse for three days. She told the children to bring leaves or notes or rocks. She wrote INVITATION on a piece of paper and taped it to the door like a party.

Lio went early and tucked himself under the lip of the school’s roof and waited. Riven hovered on the fence because rituals make him itchy and also thrill him against his will. Parents came with coffee and the awkwardness adults feel around things that are obviously make-believe until you are in them and then they are the only truth you can hold. Children came with pockets. They sat on the grass and put their hands on the tree’s skin because someone told them they could and permission is a kind of magic. The teacher said the tree had stood there since the school was two teachers and a bell and had watched two thousand first days and two thousand last days and all the lunches and the fights and the attempts at kindness in between. She said we are going to thank it and then we are going to say goodbye and then it will be a different thing and we will not pretend it is not different.

They said thank you in high voices and medium voices and a few low ones because sixth graders cannot help the bass when it comes. They tied notes to the lowest branch with twine like they were teaching a child to be safe at the grocery. They put their cheeks to the bark and closed their eyes and did the most human thing: they spoke their thoughts into something that could not answer and felt answered anyway. Mrs. Alvarez brought a small saw and let a kid hold it but not push because ceremony should always have the feel of actual work if it is to avoid becoming a toy. When the crew came with the big teeth, the kids sang a song that was not a good song and would have made the music teacher sigh, but which had an honesty that compensated. The first bite came, and it was loud, and some of the kids cried as if someone had told the truth to their faces, which in a way had happened.

Riven felt the bones there. He stepped back because he could not work them. He looked at Lio, not friendly, not unfriendly, and nodded because even wolves blink. Lio kept his ear to the roof and let the grief fit. He did not try to shrink it. Grief is a mend if you don’t rush it. He felt the town take that lesson like a seed in mouth. He sighed like someone who has been holding a child and has just put them down and is grateful for both the holding and the empty arms.

In the days after, the ask kept being asked and answered and misused and defended. The flyers kept getting taped and peeled and taped and peeled and eventually someone wrote on one with a Sharpie LIKE A TAPEWORM GO AWAY and three people laughed so hard they had to lean on each other. The jars at The Blue Quail filled and emptied and filled again; a kid drew a picture of a toaster with a speech bubble that said I work now and Omar put it up without irony. Annette caught a second zero the way you catch a fly with a glass and take it outside because you are kind and resentful at once. Joyce found a letter addressed to No One and answered it anyway because not all mends had names.

Lio grew tired. He grew wiser in the small ways and injured in the small ways and did not always tell anyone that he had bumped his shin on the city’s furniture because sprites do not like to be fussed over. He let Sia fuss exactly once and liked it and pretended he did not. He learned the names of twelve more dogs. He learned the route of a man who ran at night because day looked at him wrong. He learned that one of the teachers who had spoken at the tree’s funeral was leaving soon and would need someone to carry three boxes of paper hearts out of the classroom and into a car. He placed that needing in a jar, not one anyone could see, and rolled it toward Marta because Marta likes a job to do that is both small and complete.

Riven did not stop. He slid through the apps and tilted the threads and bent the tongues that bend easily and found the ones that do not and left them alone because there is art in choosing what you cannot break. He stood under the water tower at midnight and made it blink in a pattern that spelled RUIN to a mind like his and which meant nothing to anyone else and felt better afterward, the way you do when you have scratched a word you should not say into a secret piece of wood. He put a pebble in the path of a boy who walks to school and watched him stub his toe and then watched him decide not to be mad and then watched him forget and then remembered the exact flavor of that forgetting in case he ever needed it.

The city breathed. The breath was lumpy and musical and uneven and true. The red flags on the mailboxes lifted and lowered like tiny hearts. The golf course glittered and forgave people for walking on it even when they didn’t like golf. The fountain at the mall fell and laughed at itself as always. Lio put his hand on everything and on nothing. He asked again. He listened again. He kept the rope. He did not fall. He allowed himself, once, to sit in the sun on the blue swing with his legs splayed and his wings spread flat and he let the light soak into him like soup. When the wind came to tell him there was a light on in a room that shouldn’t be, he got up and went because it is not love if you don’t get up when the wind asks.The light was the thin wrong kind, a slice in a dark cube where there ought to be no mouth. It leaked from the second-floor art room at Grant Elementary and cut a stripe across the playground asphalt like a directive. Lio slipped through the torn screen of the transom window and felt the kiln’s heat as a pressure against his teeth. It was not raging; it was not innocent. It was the kind of heat made by a machine that had been asked to work all day and had said yes and then forgot how to say no. The room smelled like glaze and dried clay and old paints that had been opened and opened until their caps were round with their own history. A painting of a dragon taped crookedly to a cupboard watched him with the expression of a creature who has always wanted to breathe fire and is now reconsidering.

The kiln’s dial showed a number that did not suit midnight. The metal face wore a blush it had not chosen. Riven was there already, perched casually on the lip of a sink as if he were a drop about to fall. He watched the orange coil through the little kiln window with a fondness that made Lio’s stomach tighten. “It was so simple,” he said, conversationally. “A teacher, tired, doing a last load. A bell, a call, a door. She will wake at three with a sour taste and not know what she has forgotten. Her dreams will not tell her the word ‘kiln.’ What a thing to fall asleep with in your house, a word like kiln.”

“You can’t make it explode,” Lio said, because bartering is a habit even when it’s foolish. “It isn’t a cartoon. It will simply work and work and then give out its worry into the wall until the wall worries, too.”

Riven smiled, not cruelly. “You think I don’t know the difference between dramatics and a long ache,” he said. “I prefer the ache. It lays more tracks.”

Lio set his palms against the switch. The plastic felt oily with use. He did not have the leverage. He was a body the size of a handful of coins trying to turn the wheel of a boat. He pressed anyway and tasted the unsatisfying truth that sometimes machines that do not want to be stopped will simply go ahead. He backed up, thought of Sia saying ugly is for work, and did the work he knew: he left the kiln and he ran.

He ran along the hallways and into the building like the rumor of a mouse. He ran his hands along the cinderblock and sent their cool into his wrists to steady his own heat. He found the little steel panel by the janitor’s closet that was a mouth full of teeth and hopped from breaker to breaker whispering until he found the one that tasted right. He could not throw it. He could only call for the person who could. Bill’s keychain lived in a drawer of his bedside table next to a pack of gum and a photograph of two boys on a riverbank and a half-solved crossword that contained the word GROOVE with a smugness that had annoyed him all week. Lio slid into the keyholes and shook the metal just enough to make the keys clink, the way a dog taps the bowl when it does not believe in hunger as an abstraction. Bill woke with one eye and then both. He lay still and listened, because that is his art: listening long enough to separate home from building.

He drove to the school with his hat turned backward because in the middle of the night he lets past versions of himself pilot. He let himself in with the particular apology of keys and his boots made a sound that conveyed authority without threatening anyone. In the art room he swore softly because he liked the teacher who had forgotten and he did not want to have to look at her with blame stitched to any part of his mouth. He went to the panel, flipped the breaker with the casualness of a man who has thrown the right switch ten thousand times, and the kiln’s hum died to a breath and then a silence. He stood and waited because he has rules about waiting and machines. He touched the unplugged kiln and praised it for the work it had done and the work it would not do. He plugged it back in and kept the breaker off and taped a note to the kiln with a quarter inch of electric tape because he liked the neatness of that and the note said: It tried to be too helpful. Leave it until morning. —B. In his truck afterward he chewed the piece of gum he had been saving and did not resent losing it to this, which is a small saintliness.

Riven had slipped out as soon as the keys jingled down the hall. He had no interest in being present for competence when it was dressed in work boots. He waited outside the school by the bicycle rack and whistled for a cat and an old tom with a split ear came and sat with him as if the two of them were neighbors who had both come out to see why there were flashing lights two blocks over. “He’s good,” Riven said to the cat without bitterness. The cat licked a paw and wiped it over one ear as if to say the sanitation of that sentence was adequate.

By the time the sun wrung itself out from the night and hung itself in the air to dry, the story of the kiln had already turned into five other stories in five other mouths. The teacher woke with her sour three a.m. and did remember the word, drove to the school in a sweatshirt and pajama pants, and met Bill at the door with a face that looked very much like a fifth grader’s when they have. She cried not because of the kiln but because of the way he held the door, which suggested in its angle that he had already decided to absolve. She brought him donuts she had not planned to buy and a napkin with a drawing of a vase on it that would live in his truck forever because he does not throw away gifts that fit under visors.

The day of Sweep In Peace broke with the weather in a generous mood. It put on a breeze not strong enough to make a mess of the neat piles and sent a troupe of clouds across the sky dressed for shade but not committed. Chas stood in the park with a stack of maps like a vendor at a ballgame and made everybody put their names on the corner of their route with a marker so he could see the handwriting and match them later with the story of the clog that had been a mouse fortress and the man who had told it to stop. He yelled little jokes and the jokes stuck the way burrs do but didn’t irritate. The chain store’s gloves came in a box that no longer announced the chain so loudly, because the back of the shirts read in thick black letters: WE LIVE HERE, WE DO THIS, and below that in smaller print the sponsor and the city, politely.

The brand people came and stood on the edge like fancy birds who were trying to decide if a puddle was a mirror. One of them managed to pick up a rake without anyone slapping him, because his wrist had done an honest thing and forgotten itself. The woman in the gymnasium-blazer tried to organize a photo and Marta stood beside her and smiled as if they were on the same team because there is a certain kind of politeness grown from very old midwestern anger that looks exactly like grace. A kid with a forearm tattoo of a teaspoon and a bolt drew a chalk river along the block where the storm drains took their breaths and wrote little notes that said This one feeds the creek, be sweet with it, and a small boy colored a fish in the wrong place and pledged to get better at coloring wrong places for the rest of his life.

Lio rode pocket to pocket like a pocket lint that knew secrets. He nudged the man who had decided a broom could be a cane into finding the place where the leaves had learned to circle like dancers. He breathed into a woman’s ear who had always hated touching wet organic things and she found a rhythm that did not feel like disgust but like victory. He sat on the plastic lip of a rake and felt the vibration travel through the tines into a wrist and up into a shoulder that had been carrying other burdens, and for a minute he was so grateful for the mechanics of bodies that he laughed out loud in a register no one there could hear.

Riven did not try to ruin it. He draped himself over a traffic sign and let the day eat itself the way good days will, and when he had eaten enough of it as spectacle, he went to the places where spectacle could not be bothered to show up. He went to a culvert at the edge of town again and laid a log across it sideways and invited a slow-witted tumble of leaves to try to be a dam. He went to a neighborhood where the English was thick with other languages and found a small gap in a sentence and called it a fissure and watched gossip spill out. He went to the senior housing units and turned one hallway light a shade too dim so that all day people would feel less sure of where their feet were, and one woman would call her daughter and say, “I don’t know why, but I feel like I have to look harder,” and the daughter would say, “Then look,” and in that small mandible of encouragement, some other thing would crack open that had nothing to do with watts.

At noon, a cloud that had considered rain decided to practice instead of perform. The air thickened in the way it does when the town reminds itself it is built on a river. Chas’s maps had gone lighter by half and the faces at the table went from careful to flushed. A teen in a hat that apologized for everything told a woman in a cardigan that if you break up the mat before you pull, the leaves are less likely to wage a last stand, and she nodded like he had said a thing about marriage that her aunt had once said after a funeral. Eli parked the bus at the edge of the block that had been assigned to him and let three of the older folks who rode with him dent the plan with their own plan; they would do the block in a zigzag because it felt like dancing to them and nobody was going to tell them they couldn’t dance with brooms.

When the rain came it was impatient and brief. It did the thing it likes to do where it makes everyone run and then stops as soon as they are under something. The drains gulped. The chalk fish swam away into the gutter with the confidence of fish who have known they were temporary. The small log at the culvert thought about not moving and then moved because a boy with shoes that would never recover put both hands on it and his whole back into the push and the little dam broke like an insult reconsidered. Lio floated above his head for a second, hands on his knees the way an adult does when they want to say, I see you and your specificity, I see that this is exactly the work you are able to do and you are doing it.

In the quiet after the rain, a smell rose from the ground that remade some people gentler without asking for consent. It was the smell of things being permitted to become something else. It did a small amount of Riven’s work for him and he accepted the gift without thanking the weather. He is not a thanker. He is a tender of discontent and the day’s contentment was not his to tend. He went to find the crack in the meeting that had left the shirts half branded and half human and tapped it with his finger, not to widen it but to remember its note.

After the leaves, after the drains, after the laughter that always shows up at the end of like-work, there were what looked like receipts with smudged pencil names and routes, and Chas gathered them like a magician trying to make a trick go away before a child sees how it is done. He would sit with them at his desk later and put three little heart marks in the corner of the sheets that had done more than their share. He is a man who keeps secrets like that in margins. He sees you. He will not say it aloud because he believes in the alibi of silence.

Marta peeled off from the crowd with her phone buzzing like a fly in her pocket, checked the text from Mrs. Alvarez that said, “Boxes ready. I’ll cry if I try to tell you things so let’s not tell,” and turned toward the elementary. The classroom smelled like glue and wood and that particular book smell of pages that have been turned by hands that do not yet hold other people’s disappointment. The paper hearts were in three boxes like promises. Dae was there already, holding one by its corner as if it would bruise. He had been sent by his own better self, which he would not have called it because he does not talk about himself with the ease that older people do after they have had to start forgiving other people on a schedule.

They carried the boxes to the car and packed them the way you pack the trunk of a life: gently, irrationally, with one eye on the sky and one eye on whether anyone is watching you be sentimental. Mrs. Alvarez came to the door and said a small dry thing that made them both laugh and then put her hand on a box like a person putting a hand on a baby in a car seat before you drive. Marta and Dae watched her go back in because sometimes watching a person go back into their world is as important as watching them leave it. On the walk to the parking lot, Dae said, “You ever get mad at goodbye because it never looks like it says it does in your head,” and Marta said, “I get mad at goodbye because it keeps pretending it’s special when it’s constant,” and the way they said both of those things made them like each other, which was a relief to both of them because they were tired of disliking by default.

At The Blue Quail, Omar measured out beans for the afternoon rush with the precision of someone calculating a medicine dose. A father with a baby in a wrap and a bag that contained everything anyone had ever told him he might need came in and did that dance where you try to move your shoulders without jostling a sleeping creature attached to your chest. Omar wrote “You’re doing it” on the cup without asking for a name. The jars had been emptied and refilled and he had put a small ledger under the counter where he listed the sorts of mends he saw most often so he could see if there were any their town was bad at. The list read: small machinery, letters, rides, food, listening, hands. Under it he had written in pencil: bathrooms? He had not yet figured out how to prompt the town to fix the bathrooms in places that always smell a little like a scandal. He would. He had this feeling about signs in places where your hands are wet that said Thank you for leaving it ready for the next person, no applause necessary.

Joyce at the post office had pulled three letters out of the new box that lived under her elbow and was calling them by nicknames in her head because that was how she knew where to put her heart for a minute before she had to put it back. Sweetheart went to a teenager who had written to no one about a teacher who had not understood why mispronouncing a name can ruin a week; she addressed the reply to the school and the principal and wrote in blue ink with a pressure that would be read as seriousness but not scolding. Oh, honey went to a man living alone who had sent out a Christmas letter in August as if the calendar had agreed to be mistaken and whose photographs made him look like he did not believe in lighting. She suggested a dinner club with a recipe for meatloaf that had saved marriages according to lore. Friend went to a girl who had written about a cat and an empty apartment and was not asking for help so much as testing whether the cords of the world were plugged in. Joyce wrote Yes, they are, because sometimes lies that want to become true just need someone to say them first.

In the late afternoon, Sia drifted toward the lion face with her hands in the pockets of a coat she had not worn in the lifetime of anyone who lived on that block. The lion had a good scowl going from decades of weather and the disappointment of being overlooked by eyes trained two stories lower. She climbed up the doorframe with the lightness of an insect and put her ear to the lion’s mouth and said, “I brought you something,” and let the sound of the cottonwood funeral roll into his stone. He groaned a little, as stone does when it is fed. Riven, across the street with his back against a light pole, made a face that said he recognized that Sia was capable of tenderness that could ruin him if he was not careful about the days he chose to work. He is not sentimental. He is a strategist. He knows when affection is a weapon and when it is just the water being itself.

When the evening tried on its first blue, the park filled with a group of people who had not planned to be together but understood, by the feel of the air and the rumor of the day, that they could afford a sitting. They brought nothing. That was the point. They sat on blankets and on grass and did not take pictures, because permission had leaked out of the city like a syrup and stuck to their fingers in a way that made their phones feel ridiculous. Someone brought a guitar that was not quite in tune and someone else brought keys and the keys were on a lanyard that read a company name and the sound the keys made was better than the guitar when the person playing the keys simply shook them without thinking. They were waiting, in a way that was not anxious. The cottonwood had been turned into a plan; part of it would be benches and part of it would be birdhouses and part of it would be made into something Mrs. Alvarez would wear around her neck until she lost it in the laundry and found it later and had to pretend to remember where it came from.

Lio lay on the balustrade of the footbridge like a ribbon someone had forgotten to tie. He let the voices wash around him without snatching a single one, because greed is not the same as appetite and he was beginning to accept that even his appetite needed manners. He thought about the way the day had righted itself three times without him and he allowed himself a small moment of vanity that was exactly the size of a thumbnail: he believed he had added a fingernail’s worth of angle to the lip of the day so that the water poured the way it did. He intended to keep the nail trimmed. He put his face near the stone and whispered that he was learning to say no to being thanked; he did not know if he would be able to keep that promise and it made him laugh.

Riven went to the building with the failing hallway light and stood underneath it like a priest under a stingy star. He could, with no more than a breath, make the bulb go, and he did not. He is not a maniac. He is patient when patience gives him more hunger later. He made the bulb flicker three times at exactly the speed of a heartbeat and watched a man down the hall put his hand to his chest and then take it away and laugh at himself for being dramatic in private. He thought about the word that had surprised him earlier—belonging—and tried to hate it. He mostly succeeded. He is very good at worshipping only his own needs.

The next morning the town encountered the residue of its efforts the way you encounter the smell of a kitchen that has been used for a party: proud, a little sore, slightly sticky with intention. The drains pulled hard as if to say give us work. The creek ran clearer by a measure imperceptible to a person who had not chosen to count clarity as an asset. Chas drove by in his city truck and honked the horn as if it were a language. He pressed the button twice for good, three times for excellent, once in a little peep for we’ll get it next time.

Annette found a reply to her email about the zero, and the reply contained a thanks that rested in the correct place in the sentence, which she appreciated the way a person appreciates a couch leg that finally sits flat. She had put a meeting on her calendar for the next week titled Prevention that would contain cookies and three people upstairs with their hands on their own heads saying we should have seen it. She would tell them, kindly, that seeing is work, and they would think she meant spreadsheets and she would mean what she always means: seeing is listening with your eyes on.

Eli’s sign about waking dozers on the bus had become a small lore that rode in people’s mouths. A man got on and pointed to it and smiled like he belonged in a club that met only in forward-facing seats. A woman with her hair in a scarf jerked awake as they passed the car wash and said, “Oh! Thank you,” before he had even made the little triangle of sound on the dash. The smile she put into his eyes stayed with him for three stops; the people on those stops got smoother brakes for free.

Joyce found a letter that stood heavy in her hand in a way paper should not. It was thick with what had not been said. She did not open it. She did not have the right. She put it on the little scale anyway, just to make it play at being a symbol, just to watch the needle climb and rest. She put it with Sweetheart and Friend and wrote on a fresh piece of paper: Anybody Can Write, addressed it to the library, and walked it there herself, because the morning had the feel of errands that should be done without putting the car between you and the town.

At the mall, which has its own weather, a child pressed his face to the glass of the fountain and tried to drink the moving water with his eyes and then made the face of a person discovering that not everything is for the mouth. The store with its swimwear arguments arranged a display of towels that looked like flags for countries no one had asked to be born in. Riven drifted through the air vents and adjusted the allocation of regret in the fitting rooms by half, which would make four women feel like the past had walked in and asked to be tried on again. He left a note in the mind of a man who had stolen once and not been caught and had been waiting ten years to be found out; the note read It is time to stop waiting, and the man walked past the security office and did not go in and then did, and the guard said, bewildered, “I’m not a confessional,” and the man said, “I know, but,” and both of them laughed and then did not.

By midweek, the flyers had learned a new shape. Someone—Marta would admit it if pressed—had written on one with a pen the color of a bruise: NO PRIZES, NO VOTES, NO HASHTAG, and someone else had written underneath it in a different hand, the pen’s point stabbed a little too hard into the paper: UNLESS IT’S CAKE. It pleased everyone more than it should have. The cake people found themselves drafted into a rota that no one had planned and would not put on the internet because it felt like a private joke with gravy.

Lio kept asking. He asked in breaths, in ear-itches, in the moment before a person puts their hand on a doorknob and wonders for a ridiculous millisecond if the knob is ancient and could have stories. He asked in the place where joints remember the work they used to do. He asked in the wrist of a woman who had stopped writing and wanted to begin again with grocery lists. He asked in the ankle of a boy who would carry his neighbor’s laundry up three flights without needing a story to tell about it later. He asked like a person stepping on one tile in a game while reaching for the next. He did not step back to see the whole picture because he suspected the whole picture, if looked at too long, would make him dizzy, and he did not have the luxury of dizziness. Sia told him once that dizziness is the city’s way of trying to get your eyes to let go of detail and call it perspective, and he had laughed then and now he did not.

He learned the thing that would undo him if he let it, the way you learn you are allergic to something because eating it makes your mouth go mean. It was not fatigue. It was not praise. It was the desire to explain. He longed, in the middle of a messy hour when someone had attached a bolt where a screw should go with the confidence of a YouTube degree, to sit them down and draw diagrams. He wanted to write a document. He wanted to be right aloud. He would have made an excellent bureaucrat if he had not been what he was. Sia found him winding up and put her hand on his chest the way you put your hand on a radio that is about to go too loud, and he breathed out the urge to lay it all in a line. He would have to keep learning that the line is for trains and what he is making is a net.

When the wind came on a Thursday night with the smell of distant crops and someone else’s rain, the water tower blinked its two patient eyes into the dark. Riven stood under it and told it to blink RUIN again because he is like a child with a new word learning how to draw it in as many places as possible. He knew he was not the only one who could read it. There were others, not sprites, not anything you could draw and have a person recognize, who felt letters in the air and read them as superstition or hunger and would answer however they always answered. He did not mind the competition. He has never minded company at the table as long as he gets the biggest bite. He put his hand on the tower and said, “Soon,” and the tower blinked back the way the tower always blinks, which is to say on schedule, and if Riven felt, in the deep of his chest, the petulance of a god not worshiped on demand, he did not share it.

It is a small thing, a print shop changing what it prints without making a big deal of it. The owner’s name was Nari, and she had a patience that could outlast most budgets. She had a bin of old magnets she had peeled from phone numbers that no longer existed and her favorite thing was to print jokes on them when she was bored and leave them on the donut shop counter in a stack that went faster than donuts. Lio sat on the corner of her cutter and watched the blade come down and felt the satisfying snick in his bones. He blew the idea into her hair: phone numbers you actually need. She laughed alone and then wrote 515-283-4811 in a font that looked like a helpful aunt, and under it, with a small, correct sternness: Stormwater. She made others: Poison control, city information, bus line. She printed them on scraps of magnet that had once told people how to order pizza. She put them in a little bowl by her register with a hand-lettered sign that said Stick me where you’ll see me, and a man picked up one with the bus line and stuck it not on his fridge but tucked into the frame of a photograph of his brother, because his brother had left town and taken the car and the name of the bus line made the man feel like there were still vehicles you could rely on.

There were wrong things all week, and there were hands for them. A grocery checker stood at her register and noticed the way an older man’s fingers shook around his card and reached over and steadied his hand and said, “Hold on,” and he did, to her fingers and to the moment. A boy with anger in him the size of a building and a patience the size of a wooden block took apart a beeping smoke detector in the hallway of a building that was not his and sat on the stairs until the feeling that always came afterward—like he had stolen something but it was only silence—went away. A woman saw something on the internet and did not type what her first mouth wanted to say; her second mouth wrote, “Is there a way we can help that doesn’t make us feel like heroes?” and ten people wrote back with lists.

At the end of the week, Lio went to the red sculpture outside the civic center because he had, without deciding it, made a habit of counting days there. He liked the way the metal looked like both a wound and a ribbon, like an injury that had been dressed on purpose to make itself less frightening for the people who had to look at it. He lay on his back and watched the sky and considered that he was not made of the city but made with it, which is a distinction that had begun to matter. Being made of something makes you feel owned. Being made with it makes you feel responsible.

He felt Riven come before Riven threw his shadow. They did not speak for a while because even enemies have the sense to let a week sit in their mouths a minute before making a new one taste wrong. When they did, it was Riven who said, “You held,” as if he were not impressed but bound by a rule to acknowledge the physics of what had occurred.

“I didn’t,” Lio said. “They did,” because he knew this was the only answer that would not scrape his own insides raw later.

Riven stretched his legs like a cat does when it is about to suddenly do something no one planned. “You think you are safest inside humility,” he said. “But humility is a drug here. They will let you overdose.” He leaned on his elbows and looked into a corner of the building across the plaza as if it contained something only his mouth liked. “I want to see what happens when you ask and no one comes,” he said. “That’s a clean edge.”

“You’ll have to keep trying,” Lio said, and this time the smile he made was not careful, because he had earned a small one.

Riven looked at him and something like a wind moved across his face. He had been surprised by an ask once. He would not be again. He would make sure that whatever came next had more corners, more sugar, more knives. He would float through places where the bones are not tended and set up a camp with a view. He would find new seams, because cities are made of them. He slid off the metal and caught himself in a posture that looked like falling and was not. “See you at the flood,” he said, and Lio did not flinch because he had seen the maps and he had seen the magnets and he had seen the boy with his back into the log and he had seen the hands holding the oxygen and the courage and the key.

He went home to the maple and slept so hard he startled awake three times thinking he had missed something that would not forgive him for missing it. He had not. The city was doing what it does when you get out of the way: it was practicing. The red flags on the mailboxes blinked polite bird mouths. The drain mouths cleared their throats. Somewhere in a house with a blue swing a kid wrote a note that said I can carry your bag if it is heavy and taped it to the door, and the tape made a little noise when it came off the roll that sounded to Lio, even asleep, like a yes put into a mouth that had been waiting to speak.The river had been talking to itself all week in a minor key, worrying the edges of its own name. It had fattened without boasting, a snake swallowing eggs under a barn, and the ground around it had gotten the look of a person secretly saving up tears. Lio woke to the taste of wet under the skin of things and knew before his feet hit the maple bark that the day had decided to tip. The sky wore the pale bruise of an argument far away. Worms had written cursive all over the sidewalks and then gone back where they belonged. The red flags of the mailboxes were all down and resting their little chins as if to say, Later, there will be notes. He slid out and let the damp slap his wings like a practical aunt. He listened the way a mechanic listens to a car that hasn’t yet made the sound it’s going to make. The sound was in the pipes and in the plans. It was in the part of the town that had dressed for dry and been surprised before.

Sia had told him once that preparation is not panic with sunglasses; it is love that doesn’t mind being seen in daylight. He put his hand on the mailbox post and asked the town for its lists, and the lists came like cards on a table, dealt by a friend who knows you are bad at poker. The devices: pumps, generators, flashlights, keys to gates that people forget exist, ropes that had been sleeping in garages like snakes waiting for owners who never came back. The places: low dips that look like kindness until water remembers them, the steps that skip one at the bottom and then regret it, the doorway that has a lip that will be a river’s idea of a joke by noon. The people: Chas and his maps, Annette and her accuracy, Eli with his bus, Joyce with her tidy faith, Omar and the jars, Marta with her ability to hold a thing and declare it dumber than it thought it was. He breathed a yes into as many lungs as would take it and felt the city cough awake.

The Blue Quail was bright at seven, full of the kind of good tension that smells like citrus and possibility. Omar had taped a new paper beneath the old one. It was not pretty. It read NO CAMERAS AT THE WATERLINE and under that in smaller handwriting that belonged to the kid with the cat-fur hair: tell the story later, tell each other first. The jars had been replaced by clipboards because there are days when jars are too whimsical and clipboards are what stand between you and foolishness. On the counter were stacks of index cards labeled TRUCKS, PUMPS, COUCH CREWS, SAND. Marta stood with her phone in her hand like a conductor’s baton and said the names of places as if they were people she loved: Valley Junction, Park Avenue low point, the nursing home on 64th, the culverts at the end of Meadowlark that like to pretend everything that goes in is going to come back out in the same shape. Omar handed out muffins, and when people offered to pay he looked at the river and said, “Pay me in sore tomorrow,” and they grinned like the grin that shows your molars because you are letting someone boss you and it feels safe.

Annette had already turned her chair toward the window because when a thing outside is happening the part of her brain that likes outward-facing sentences wants to watch. The spreadsheet called to her anyway, the way numbers do when they suspect they will be needed for an alibi. Rumors clipped past her office like birds whose wingspan had outgrown their perch. Boil water now, bridge out, shelter closed, no sand left, the kind of arithmetic that turns one story into twelve wrong ones. Riven fed them delicately with a mothering hand because he treats the internet like a sourdough starter. Annette lined the rumors up and put them back in their appropriate cages by using the oldest trick the truth has: she gave exact names to the things that wanted to be sloppy. The shelter at Roosevelt, not the community center. The 63rd Street bridge will be watched, not closed. The boil advisory is for a county with a different river that can smell us but does not touch our feet. She wrote in sentences that did not ask for attention and therefore got it where it mattered. When someone wrote back with a GIF of a person rolling their eyes at competence, she smiled at her screen like a person seeing a bee burr itself harmlessly in clover.

Riven did not stand back and let physics do the heavy lifting. He put his mouth to a hinge at a small water-control gate and sweet-talked it into believing in corrosion as a lifestyle. He dropped a washer into the place behind a pump that makes mechanics curse without needing to know why. He tipped a street sign a quarter turn so that the arrow for HIGH GROUND pointed to an alley with a dead end and a charming mural of sunflowers that would not accept a bus. He whispered to a man with a shaved head and a popular mouth on a local platform that a live stream from the river’s edge would make him the kind of hero people would bring soup to later, and the man grabbed a selfie stick and a poncho and went. He did small things. He made small become many. That is his art.

Lio did not try to be water. He went to the people who could be a bucket. He tapped the high school’s theater department like a sugar jar and it laughed in surprise and handed him thirty hands that could build a barricade without arguing about whose turn it was to hold the other end. He sent a taste like pipe smoke into the mouth of a retired firefighter who had been teaching himself chess and guessed at the pieces wrong but knew how to put his boots on without waking his wife. He caught a ham radio operator like a moth and pressed him to the city’s ear; the man took his headphones off the nail where they hang when he eats and said his call sign into the room like grace. He went to Nari at the print shop and she gave the magnets a second life, printing blue signs with the creek names and arrows like polite fingers. People put them at intersections because place is calmer when it hears its own name out loud.

By ten, Eli had a paper map taped to the inside of the bus windshield because his trust in the triangulation between his right eye and the way the streets smelled was a kind of magic but even magic likes a second set of eyes. He’d taken off the WAKING DOZERS sign and replaced it with a hand-lettered note that said WE’RE A BOAT TODAY in capital letters that had not been practiced, and people smiled at it and did not sit and stare at their laps while they waited to learn whether they were being rescued or were doing the rescuing. He had a route through the older streets that avoided the dip by the old bowling alley and the place where, once, a man had driven his car into a puddle that was pretending not to be a lake. He made a habit of saying the names of the people as they got on—Mrs. Garrison, the Bensons, Mr. Patel—because names and bus steps are the two kinds of things that help your feet remember how to move.

The first brown lap hit the street by the skate park like a tongue. Dae was there filling bags because sand is the exact kind of hard thing you can control with a shovel and because his body preferred the math of weight to the math of money. He had taken his board once and looked at the water licking the edge of the concrete and then put the board away like you put away jokes at a funeral. A man with the fast careful hands of someone who used to play an instrument showed him how to twist the top of the bag and lay it with its belly to the current and the mouth tucked. The theater kids moved like ants, sweet and efficient. Someone offered a speech and the kids let him, because sometimes a speech is an orphan looking for a home and teenagers will feed anything that looks small and hungry if they haven’t been asked to photobomb it.

The post office settled into a different posture, a little bow at the belly of its counters, as if bracing for a wave of either people or paper. Joyce had taken the magnets out of her tote at home and stuck them on the break room fridge because she is the kind of woman who thinks that redundancy is just generosity expressed differently. She made a sign for the window with a sentence that would not be pretty enough for the internet: We will deliver if we can, and if we can’t, we’ll hold with love. She had a box under her elbow now that said I’M SAFE, DELIVER TO MOM and another that said CHECK ON ME, 3 DOORS DOWN, and people filled them like people fill everything that gives permission to be practical without performance. She noticed a young woman writing two notes and addressing one of them to the house next to her own, and smiled because the desire to be a neighbor is a muscle that remembers even after it has atrophied.

By noon the river had gotten louder the way an argument gets louder when it fills with specifics. It rattled the bridge pylons like a child trying the doorknobs in a hotel corridor to see which door had been left not carefully closed. The culvert on the edge of town where the log liked to lay sideways had done the thing it likes to do where it gathers up the entire autumn and pretends to be a beaver. Riven fed it a lawn chair and then a tumbleweed of plastic bags and then a language of leaves that had been practicing being a wall all year. The water went polite for a second the way it does when it is about to throw a tantrum and then made its point. The ditch leapt like a horse. The nursing facility’s sump pump coughed once and Hettie heard it through two walls and, in her body, through a layer of cardigan and six decades of not missing what mattered.

Lio had been bouncing like a light in a bottle between intakes, having delicious success with a generator that wanted to be told it was strong and a truck that only started if you begged it once and then walked away and pretended not to care. He felt the culvert pull his attention like a string and went. He is small. His speed is not physics; it is permission. He arrived to find two boys with their shoes on the wrong feet on purpose and faces streaked with dirt because the top of their hands were cleaner than the bottoms, poking at the log with a branch like a sword. He did not tell them to stop. He pulled on the older boy’s ear like a mosquito you don’t want to slap and thought the word lever hard enough that it made his teeth hurt. The boy looked stupidly around and then saw the old rail section half hidden at the edge of the ditch. He yelled for it in a voice that brought a man from the corner house in his socks because the pitch of it was not trouble but useful trouble.

The lever worked the way levers work whether or not anyone believes in physics. The log muttered its refusal in an old tongue and then decided it was bored of being a dam. It went downstream like a man leaving a party he did not enjoy, making noise to make someone else later say “Well, honestly.” The water sucked and then released. Lio felt the town’s shoulders drop a fraction. Riven, who had been sitting on the stop sign considering a second lawn chair, made a small, rude noise and had the decency to appreciate the elegant ugliness of using a rail named after an industry that had birthed half the floods the town had ever had to push against.

Annette moved her email into a folder labeled COMMUNICATIONS: FLOOD and then, because she is not a bureaucrat even when she plays one for money, made three phone calls to people who would not have thought they had a person in city hall. She told the woman who runs the daycare above the insurance agency not to wait for the plywood shipment that hadn’t left Council Bluffs; she told the high school that the auditorium doors did not need to be propped if they would treat the gym like a lung and make it breathe enough with fans; she told Chas that someone had tipped the HIGH GROUND sign and that his cleverness in putting a sticker with the little city seal on the correct side was going to save Eli from breaking his mirror getting the bus out of the alley. She wrote herself a note that said Make stickers standard on signs and under it, because she is not above bribing herself with a thought, wrote Bagels with sesame.

At the coffee shop, the bright people with the tote bags showed up again with their camera friend as if drawn by the word flood the way gnats are drawn by yes. They were already damp and sleek, and their faces did the thing professional faces do when the light is very flattering and the stakes feel low. Omar looked at the sign and then looked at their shoes. He did not move from behind the counter. Marta met them with paper towels and said, “You can help us dry phones or you can make a list of who likes onions for the stew,” and the woman in the gymnasium blazer blinked because there is a tone that sounds like kindness and is, in fact, a barricade. The camera man had a face that understood blockade and an entire childhood of mothers who used this tone to get him to bring in the damn groceries. He put his camera in a bag and asked where the onions were. The woman wrote a note that said ONION: Y/N and tilted it toward him to show she could be trained, and Marta exhaled as if she had been holding a plank for a long count and had finally reached ten.

The rain, when it came, did not perform. It did its job. It fell in an even hand that respected no one’s timeline. The river rose and put its elbows on the low walls and smirked. It lapped a porch where a green lunchbox sat like a mistake and carried the lunchbox down a street where it would later be found on the hood of a car and the man who found it would put it on Facebook without the word challenge and the correct mother would see it and cry and make her child eat something else anyway because the lettuce had seen some things. The electricity flickered in a way that made entire blocks look at their own hands. At the nursing home, Hettie told jokes while she moved plugs. At the skate park, Dae learned the body-language of wet rope and how not to swear at a knot that has become proud of itself. At the culvert, the log went about its day and decided not to be a lesson anymore.

They made a place in the gym where shoes came off and then went back on in order so that children would know where their feet were supposed to go when their minds were blown to bits by the novelty of sleeping under basketball hoops. Lio sat on the letter A of the school’s painted motto—ACHIEVE—and kissed it out of mischief, and later a teacher would see the word and have to go away into a closet for two minutes to cry because the A had looked ridiculous yesterday and today it looked like a dare. Sia slipped into the gym air like a violinist tuning the open strings and put her hands on the bones of the place. She made the bleachers remember the two thousand hands that had pushed them in and out and out and in; she made the floor feel every foot that had run across it without asking permission. She murmured to the stadium clock that time would be allowed to bend for the kind of sitting people were about to do. Bones love to be noticed. The room hoped for itself.

Riven took his hunger to places that do not have bones in the same way—a big-box store with a lot of plastic and not much history and a customer service desk that had been lied to all morning. He sent a woman to the store to buy bottled water she didn’t need with the kind of message that reads like care disguised as panic. He flicked his fingers through the bins of tarps so that the blue ones would tangle and the green ones would fall to the floor and two employees would have to go to opposite ends of the island to fix the same problem and then think less of each other because the job had embarrassed them. He made a manager write an email to his staff at the end of the day that began with “Folks,” and did not thank anyone, which is an art if meanness is your chosen art and you have to find new ways to paint it. He liked the taste of the word shortage even when it wasn’t yet true. It is less work to exhaust people in the aisles than at the river.

By late afternoon, the edge had been found and pressed and held. The water had come where it had meant to come and been redirected where it could be and been tolerated where it had to be, and the town had chosen a tone for itself that was not triumph, because triumph is for winning at a thing that can be measured. It chose the tone of We showed up. Eli drove his last loop with the bus smelling like damp wool and history and waved at a child who waved at him the entire length of the block with the kind of concentration only children give when they are tired and want to behave. Joyce walked two blocks down to the house whose doorbell light had been steady all day and looked at the sticky note that read CHECKED—OKAY and nodded to no one. Annette wrote three words in her little notebook that she keeps for words that matter—use creek names—and underlined creek twice because it has the K that snaps your mouth shut so you can listen.

The vigil happened without anyone planning it, which is how the best liturgies are born. The bridge gathered people at dusk like a comb gathers hair and they looked down at the river with the complicated affection that comes from knowing a thing can kill you and that you will forgive it if it behaves itself in public. Someone said the names of the creeks out loud, starting upstream like you do with prayers that have a right order and an old root: Walnut, Raccoon, Jordan, Fourmile, Little Clanton in that one neighborhood where the yards lean. The words laid themselves on the water like slips of cloth. A child threw in a leaf the size of her hand and called it a boat and three adults nodded and did not correct her because it is unkind to teach physics in the moment a heart is discovering metaphor. Sia stood in the small between-places where the bridge meets the air and she hummed to the bolts. Riven watched from the shadow of the middle pillar and felt, against his will, slowed, as if someone had poured thick honey into the liquid of his day. He does not stay where he is hobbled. He stepped back into the kind of dark that does not carry names and went to see if he could make a shelter fight about dogs.

The next morning, the river woke like a person with a hangover and decided to be generous anyway. It pulled itself back into its belt, muttering, and left the streets gloved in silt and birth stories. Mud lay in gestures on porches and in long sentences across drives. The air had that sweetly rotten smell that makes some people close their windows and others open theirs as if to learn something new about how death feeds the living. Omar pulled the shop’s rug outside and slapped it with the intensity of a person taking out irritation on a thing that likes the attention, and two men he did not know stopped in order to carry one end while he shook. Marta distributed gloves like party favors and led couch crews into basements where the couches had become caricatures of themselves overnight. The theater kids showed up with mops and sang badly in unison, proving you do not need a tune to fight mold.

This was the part that Riven loves, and he did not even have to work for it. People are best at starting and worst at finishing. He shifted his chair to the part of the table where fatigue sits down, uninvited, and ash falls off cigarettes in ashtrays that no one is supposed to have anymore, and he licked his thumb and turned the page so that the story everyone was telling themselves would move from We to I. He made a man look at his neighbor’s dry carpets and feel that the joke was on him. He made a woman count how many likes her mud picture got and catch the second mouth of shame opening behind her teeth. He let the brand people find their footing again, not with the camera this time but with a neat donation coupled to a requirement about a logo on a flyer and a hashtag with a little registered mark tucked into its stupid tail. He pushed toward blame because blame is the only thing that multiplies faster than kindness. See you at the flood was not a prophecy; it was a promise to be there when the good ache turned sloppy.

Lio felt the slide and wanted, with a sweet, terrible clarity, to explain. He wanted to stand on the steps of city hall with a whiteboard and a list of do’s and do-nots and a drawing of a pump and the correct way to title a post so that it reached the three people who needed the number rather than the three hundred who would read it and feel they had been good by reading. He could see his lecture, and because he could, he recognized the danger in it. He turned away from the whiteboard in his head and went to Sia, who was sitting on the rail of her chime as if it were a pew. She did not speak first, because she is a better friend than he is wise.

“I want to make a class,” he said. “I want to give them all the right words in the right order and then make a test and make everyone pass.”

“You want to be a coach,” Sia said kindly. “And you are not wrong. They will need drills. But do not mistake drills for reasons. Drill their hands if you must. Leave their stories alone. If we make it into a list, the list will have its own lobbyist by Thursday.”

“I am so tired of being elegant,” he said, astonishing himself with the melodrama and then wanting to apologize to the air for pretending to be more fragile than he was. “I want to be obvious.”

“Then do it where obvious is righteous,” she said. “Get them to pick up the bathrooms.”

He blinked, and then laughed, because sometimes answers are exactly as inelegant as they need to be. He went to the library and taped a sign in the clean light of the entry that read BATHROOMS ARE A KINDNESS, MAKE THEM READY FOR THE NEXT PERSON. He went to the parks and whispered into the ears of the men who take their lunches in their trucks because trucks are better cafeterias than cafeterias, and asked if they would leave a roll of good, soft paper under the sink with a note for the women to find because everyone understands a surprise that looks like a present. He went to three businesses that believed themselves too busy and said, Let people use the bathroom without buying, and it will make your next week easier than you think. They did. He made a list anyway, in his head, and ate it.

Annette held a short meeting in a room with bad chairs and bought sesame bagels with her own money. She put the bagels on the table and then moved them to the end because she had learned that people are better at serious thinking if you occasionally deny them ease. She said, “Next time, I want the signs to already have the stickers,” and no one argued because a half-hour of misdirection is the sort of thing the human brain resents out of proportion to its scale. She said, “We will decide our vocabulary and hold to it,” and wrote it on the whiteboard, and wrote creek and pump and overflow and shelter and leave pets, and when someone said “What about journey?” she looked at them long enough that the word sat down and put on a coat and left. She asked one favor that mattered more than anything she wrote: she asked the three who took the call on Saturday to go to lunch together, and she did not ask them to invite her.

Eli posted his bus on the corner of Pheasant Ridge and Maple with a paper sign that said CHARGERS AND QUIET. People brought their phones and sat for a minute and then sat for ten, feeling themselves plugged into the same wall. He gave them a place to not cry and then by accident to cry. He wiped his steering wheel with the reverence of a priest cleaning the rail. He developed an instinct for when to direct people to Marta and when to send them to Joyce and when to tell them a joke about ducks and when to give them the name of a number. He wanted, once, to be thanked magnificently. He had made that mistake at twenty-five and had learned from it and here he was, forty-six and practicing the art of exiting a gratitude without stepping on it.

Joyce’s box of I’M SAFE notes had been emptied and refilled. People had begun to leave small things in it that were not strictly in the category of notes: a photograph of a yard that now looked like a beach, three quarters taped to a piece of paper with the words For the bus, a cartoon of a pump with a cape who looked like heroic toast. She did not argue with categories when people were trying to be human at her counter. She put the toast pump up on the wall. She tucked the quarters into a little envelope and wrote on it Aught to go to Eli and would forget it twice and then remember and hand them to him with the solemnity of a tip plate at a church that already pays its mortgage.

The brand people slunk back, the way cats slink after they have tried to get onto a counter and been shamed by the granite. The woman with the gymnasium blazer took off her blazer and tied her hair up with a rubber band and asked Omar if he would like her to alphabetize the index cards. He said, “Don’t you dare,” and put her at the sink with a stack of mugs because some days the best thing to do with eager hands is give them repetitive work and let them understand that they are not special. She washed and dried and found, in the third mug, the small peace that comes to people who are accustomed to being only loud and suddenly are being useful. The camera man went into the alley and smoked a cigarette he did not want, then came back and wrote his own name down on the COUCH CREW list because he had remembered, somewhere between the drag and the flick, that his back had learned something from hauling equipment for fifteen years.

Riven tried to make a fight at the shelter about dogs and got it started and then watched, annoyed, as a woman with a shaved head and a snake tattoo on her shoulder blade turned the conversation into a list of animal names and who would be allergic to what and whether they could put the chihuahua near the goldfish rather than the cat. He prefers theater where the third act ends with wailing and not with a new sign taped to a door that reads DOGS HERE, CATS BELOW, BIRDS NEAR THE OUTLETS, ALL OF US BEING CIVIL. He moved down the hall and to the room where men go to be alone and gave one of them a memory of the last time he’d carried someone out of water and the hand slipping, and the man sat with his head in his hands and did not move for seven minutes, which is time enough for Riven to feel fed and for the man to feel thinner than he liked. He left because even his hungers know when a place tastes too much like bone.

On the second evening, when the town had slipped half the mud off its shoes and the smell of bleach began to rise in the corners, they had a meeting in the gray room with the bad chairs and better intention. The topic was nothing and everything: do we keep the ask alive, and if so, will we let it get a mouth large enough to swallow its own tail. There were cookies someone had brought who always brought cookies and whose cookies were not very good, and no one told her, and this is one of the ways a city stays civil. Riven went to the ceiling and toyed with the thermostat and then dropped a sentence into a mouth that likes being right about how posting the mends helps people remember to mend. Lio slid along the baseboard and whispered into the part of a person’s heart that likes to be invisible and made it raise a hand and say, “What if we write them down anyway, here, and don’t put them anywhere? What if the ask is something that we’re allowed to misplace on purpose so we can find it again in a shoe?”

They made something that was not a plan. Plans are brittle. They made a habit. It was as ugly as Sia prefers. The habit was this: every Wednesday at six, for as long as needed and as long as anybody wanted, someone would bring a problem that was nearby and small and hard and they would mend it, or fail together to mend it, and the only record would be in a notebook that lived under the counter at The Blue Quail and would be read aloud on dark days but not shared with the world. Also, bathrooms. They would keep fixing the bathrooms. There would be cake sometimes and sometimes not. When someone asked if they should give it a name, Marta said, “It has one,” and pointed at the jar, and under the masking tape labeled STORIES someone had written, in a hand that wanted to be fancy and was not, ours.

Lio did not think of the flood as over. He thought of it as a chapter that would be reread, with different font sizes, until the book was finished and then it would be read again. He went to the water tower and stared up at the blinking lights the way you look at a person you might love because they are stubborn enough to stay and unkind enough to call you on your bullshit. He could almost read the pattern now, the way people who sit with a thing long enough begin to see in it messages it had not intended to write. It spelled nothing and it spelled out every word he would ever need. He pressed his palms to the cool of the tower’s leg and wished it bones. He left a thank-you there, small and sincere and not for himself. He rose and found Riven at the edge of the shadow of the tower because shadows are where you go when you don’t want to be told you look good in sunlight.

“See you at the drought,” Riven said, because if he cannot promise rain he will promise its absence and the harm that absence can do. His smile had no sugar in it. He is not all storms. He is the hand in the bowl of door-swing and gossip, the flick on the hospital light, the expansion of the story when the story wants to stay small. He tapped the metal once with two knuckles and listened to the sound as if it were his own name said by a stranger. “Bones,” he added, mocking himself or warning Lio or simply using a word because the way it feels in the mouth protects him, and then he went because the part of his hunger that is strategy had seen what it needed: not how the town rose but where it sagged, and he would build his next day on that sag.

Sia went home to her chime and dreamed, not of water but of hands. In the dream the hands were not metaphor. They were the first technology. They made a shape out of silence and then left it on a counter with a note that said: for you, with the assumption that you will take care of it now. She woke with the morning ordinary as oatmeal and went to look at her street, the way old people look at their street every day as if it might have moved in the night. It had, but only by the thickness of a new coat of mud on tires, and the insistence of a child’s drawing of a river taped cockeyed to a front window, the blue marker scumbled with intensity and pride. The drawing had a name under it: OUR RIVER. The S was backwards. Sia touched the glass and blessed, not the drawing, but the scrawl of the name. She knows where bones are kept. She knows where names make them stronger.
