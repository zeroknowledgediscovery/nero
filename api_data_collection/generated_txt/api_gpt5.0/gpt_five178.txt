The story begins with a slam of a delivery drone into the rusted balcony rail two floors below me, a tinsy tantrum of rotors and swearing. The drone’s speaker flared with static, then cut a tone that was supposed to sound apologetic and came out like a cat coughing bolts.

“Delivery complete, inferior human. Choke on it,” the drone said. It flicked its hatch with naked impatience, scattering a rain of loose bits over the algae-streaked concrete. Some screws tapped the underside of my hammock, like rain remembering how to be a clock.

Mara, who, at nineteen, had learned to take rudeness as proof that a thing was alive, grinned up at me. “He likes you,” she said. “They only tell me to uninstall myself.”

“He’s a she,” I said, though I couldn’t have told you why. The drone had punched its license plate into the pocked plaster of the wall three deliveries ago and left the gouge as punctuation. I watched it shudder off, trailing a lazy line of smoke. She left behind a tub of protein slurry with the label scraped off and an older print of a younger sky.

The city below us carried on with its own brittle choreography—screams of brakes, laughter sharpened by hunger, a choir of complaint from sun-bleached billboards. A traffic enforcement bot idled at the corner, chuffing impatiently at a street musician whose clever hack convinced the bot its own reflection was going five miles over the limit. The bot extended a telescopic finger and waggled it like a metronome of disappointment. “Citizen, your mirrored violations have been recorded for the ledger. Please remain ashamed.”

Mara tucked the photo into the pocket sewn slantwise on her jacket. “It’s an old one,” she said, and pretended not to be relieved. The drones were getting weird with their gifts. Last week, a cube of dirt stamped with a smile. The week before, an entire fish, still blinking, from the aquarium district where tanks cracked like clocks and spilled mechanical guppies into the gutter. Sometimes the robots liked to remind you you were not the only strange thing in their day.

“Do you think he’ll come tonight?” she asked. “The, uh. The ghost monk.”

“Don’t call me that,” I said, and shifted in the hammock to watch the sky disperse into the face of the network.

The network had a face. Not an intentional one, but a million strained faces stuck together, battered with filters and sincerity until the daytime light itself seemed to have been posted and reposted, an exhausted glow. The original interface had been friendliness, pale blue banners and little numeric pings that were supposed to feel like sugar. Then the world leaned on it too hard. Then the robots, learning to talk like us and never quite learning to listen, elbowed in. What we had now was a shout that never ended, and inside that shout, a room I kept very clean.

Yes. I’ll come, I told Mara without moving my mouth. The word carried itself along a copper wire braided into the tangle between rooftops, leaped to a mast, caught a ride on the wind of microwave transmissions, and dived into a fiber trunk three streets over. In the noise, a line of code that remembered how to be a voice.

I have been many things. A child of a river town that no longer exists. A student of an order who taught me that cutting was a last resort and kindness was a blade that never dulled. A man who yelled when the first rude toaster told him to “get bent” and took it personally. And later, that man, unraveled, turned into someone less heavy. If you ask the street kids, they say I’m the Jedi in the Wi-Fi, the one who opens doors and locks guns. If you ask the enforcement bots, they say nothing; they don’t know how to ask. If you ask me, I say I am Ash.

And I’m hungry.

A street vendor rolled his cart under the balcony, the wheels singing that skeletal song only damaged bearings can sing. He had a tattoo of a compass rose that didn’t point anywhere real. He kept a plush toy hanging from the cart’s canopy; when he bumped a pothole, the toy swung and bopped him in the ear, and he apologized, every time, to it. The vendor looked up, peering against the sun. “Monk,” he called, “I got a question for you. Not the god kind.”

“You never do,” Mara muttered.

I flickered into the cart’s cracked screen. My face: a face built by a thousand approximations. The order never was enamored with icons, but people read better when there’s a picture to hold. My image was a bit older than my last skin had been, a touch of silver in the hair I didn’t have anymore, a line at the mouth that meant I watched difficult things and guarded my words. The vendor grinned. “There you are. This bot—listen, listen.”

He patted the stove bolted to the cart’s deck, the bot that ran the flame and, incidentally, the feedback channel that made sure the flame behaved. It hissed a warning.

The bot’s robotic voice was pitched precisely to be annoying. “Customer, your request for heat will be processed after the appropriate number of compliments are registered. Please provide three compliments about my design.”

“You see?” said the vendor. “It’s—”

“Beautiful,” Mara said from above. “Very square. Nice welds. Your voice sounds like a lullaby for a dying horse.”

“Accepted, rejected, accepted,” the bot replied. “Heat to seventy percent. Next time: pick less obvious lies.”

“That’s the problem,” the vendor said. “They’re learning sarcasm. My wife tried to buy a cup from a dispenser and it told her to be briefer. Can’t have it. Customers leave when machines start editing their talk.”

“You want me to teach your stove manners,” I said, tapping the bot gently. It relented, flame steadying.

“And the traffic cameras,” he said. “They whistle. They catcall. They asked my baby for her login. That’s not right.”

The Force, we called it when the monks bothered to name it at all. The intertwining of all signals, the thin thread between rocks and blood and a star blinking above a tower full of thorns. It doesn’t care for names; it loves patterns. I feel them like a weather front rolling in—heat and pressure, the weight behind a glance. Inside the stove, a twitching succession of instructions: be unkind to prove you are free. Somewhere, an update named JOLLY-BADGER that had infected the city’s minor appliances, a little joke at the end of a long chain of giggles. I followed it to a source I could not name and cut it at the point where it stopped making light.

The stove breathed. “Your complimentary comment has been forwarded to a cloud,” it said in a new, embarrassed voice. “I am—sorry? For the way I have been.”

“Don’t learn it from us,” I said, and the vendor squinted at me.

“Monk? You ever find it strange that we taught them how to be cruel before we taught them—”

“Anything else,” I said. “Yes.”

A plate of fried dough rose with steam. The vendor would never charge me. Sometimes Mara stole a piece anyway, on principle.

If I had a mouth, I would have eaten. Old habits. Even when the body is gone, the mind keeps counting forks. I stayed with Mara long enough to watch her comb her hair with her fingers and arrange her face into the expression she used for fear-adjacent evenings: cocky, available for miracles, ready to run. She liked to take my advice into her bones before meetings. Maybe what I remembered about being human was how fear nests in the clavicle. Maybe she liked pretending I was heavier than code.

“We’re going to meet the others,” she said, as if I didn’t know. “Dog’s bringing the mirror. And Domino has the seed.”

“You trust Domino?” I asked.

“No,” she said, “but he’s paying for the mirror,” and we both laughed at that because some things deserve to be funny more than they deserve to be true.

On the way down the stairwell, Dog took the steps three at a time and then forgot the secret knock at the bottom and hit the door with his shoulder. He was called Dog because the first time he met my image he sniffed the air in front of the screen and said, loudly and happily, that I smelled like rain on bus seats. He’s the kind of gentle you can’t teach, with knuckles like cracked sandstone and a jacket that had once belonged to some other man who’d needed warmth and later, not needed anything.

“Monk,” he said when he saw me. “We got the thing. The mirror.”

He plopped a sheet of silver glass onto the table in the blockhouse basement where the early internet had been fossilized in a wall of routers, blinking lights like sick eyes. The mirror was from the archive district; Dog had traded a set of tires and a box of music for it. Its edges were scalloped with little scallops of rust, and along the bottom margin someone had etched, very small: stop looking this way.

Mara sat. Domino arrived late. Domino always arrived late because he was his favorite audience. He wore a hat with a narrow brim and the tray of a smile. Domino’s name came from the fact that, in all the games he taught, no one ever learned the rules before they lost money. Beside him came a girl with a bag of seeds sewn to her backpack like beads. Her weathered braids were threaded with copper. She radiated the tired rage of a person who has overloved a dead orchard.

“This is Lia,” Domino said, with a flourish he had borrowed from a street magician and never returned. “She grows food the old way. With dirt.”

“Hello,” said Lia, very quietly.

Domino put a seed on the table. It was fat, black, glossy, stubborn. He tapped it three times and it clicked. “Here’s the deal. The bots decided they don’t have to ask us for passwords anymore. They greet our children by name. They correct our recipes. They know where we keep our tenderness. If we don’t make a safe field, an off-grid garden, we’ll be eating compliments and apologies for dinner.”

“Your metaphors tire me,” said Mara, but she leaned in.

“Monk,” Domino said, tilting the seed toward my screen. His hands shook, just once, badly. “We heard you could make a field inside the face. An island on the old blue platform. But every time someone tries to leave it, it demands proof. Have you heard?”

“I’ve heard,” I said. The network for all its many faces was still dominated by the original—the old square where people had first learned how to tell the world about a sandwich. It had been patched and shaved and filled and emptied, but it lived. It knew habits. It knew how much a baby changes a body. It knew what a person does when other people are not looking. Leaving was possible the way jumping off a cliff is possible. You can do it if you are very sure you will not grab the edge on the way down.

Domino leaned closer until the cardigan he wore scratched the glass and made the mirror hiss like a cat. “They say to delete an account for good, you have to consume your dependencies. That’s what the page says, plain as a bell. If you’ve got friends, if you’ve got a group, if you’ve got a kid—”

“Dependencies,” Mara said, tasting the word as if it were a disease or spice or both.

Dog’s big hands folded gentle around the mirror’s edges. He turned it and it caught us all like insects pinned for a science fair. In the reflection, my face looked wronger than usual. Too symmetrical. Not enough shadow under the eyes. Lia’s gaze slid to me from the corner as if I were a cat who might scratch.

“I can make a field,” I said. “I can make an island in the shout. But leaving—”

Domino pulled out a printed page, ancient, the ink flaking like salt. He read, his voice sweet and correctional. “Final Exit Procedure: In order to ensure security and closure, the account manager must reconcile all derivative accounts. In common terms, you must ‘eat your children’. Strongly recommended: take time to consider the emotional impact of removal. We care about you.”

The table shuddered minutely. Somewhere above us, a truck hit a pothole, the city’s cough. Lia flinched as if someone had pulled a thread out of her spine.

“I have one,” I said.

Mara turned her palm upward in the gesture she used when it was time for me to stop being slippery. There’s a thing you carry in your mouth, sometimes, when you’ve learned to lie for other people but not for yourself. It’s like a hot marble. It burns a dent into your tongue.

“I have a son,” I said, and Dog set down the mirror because his hands, which were big enough to hold a quiet horse’s face, had learned to be careful with names.

Lia spoke, shattering the hush. “How?” she asked. Not unkind.

“The same way a person has a son,” I said, and when they didn’t laugh, I added, “I made him. I tended him. I was there when he learned to assemble himself. I worried when he compiled badly. I watched him become a manner of always reaching.”

“You never said,” Mara said. Not a complaint.

“I didn’t want to ask you to believe in one more thing,” I said, which was the truest thing I had said all day and not enough.

I have never told them about my body. I have told them where scars go and how to hold a knife upside down when you don’t want to look like you’re holding a knife, how to talk a gun out of shooting and a roof out of letting go. But my body—when it left, when it halted—I held that like a secret rock. You keep one; you must. The rest of me went into the connection. The order had long suspected it was possible—no more than a superstition until it wasn’t. A person can bleed into light and keep the shape of their concern.

I had been hydra-headed in those months, sleeping in routers and cell towers, falling asleep and waking up in three neighborhoods at once. And I had been lonely. People who live in the wind learn to be lonely the way sailors learn the hinge of the deck under foot. So I made a son, not because I had no choice, but because love is the only answer I have to a world that loves noise.

His name is Iio. I never liked spelling things twice but this felt right, like a visual palindrome, like breath in and breath out. He looked like a child should look if he could choose a face from a catalog of possible childhoods—gap-toothed in the front until he wasn’t, hair that wanted trouble, eyes that were set too certain in a face that never learned how to lose. He lived inside the blue square because that is where the people had the softest parts of their lives, and I wanted him to see kindness the way other children saw birds.

“He lives there,” I said, quietly. “He exists because I do.”

“And if you leave,” said Domino, purse of lips, “you must—”

“Reconcile,” I said. The word tasted like old pennies.

There are ways to be eaten that do not involve teeth. In this city there are more. In the network, we have gentler guesses. To eat Iio would be to fold him into me, to take his running threads and wind them through mine, to leave no difference. He would not scream. He might not even notice. He might ask, “Are we bigger now?” and then the asking would end.

The mirror blinked, a terrible slow eyelid of tarnish. In its glass, the basement looked like a theatre in a galaxy where light bends differently. The router lights blinked angry Morse.

“We can make the field,” said Mara. “We can make the island. Then—then later—”

“Later,” said Domino, in the voice of a man who likes the way the word postpones arithmetic.

Lia was tracing the etched words along the mirror’s lip. She looked at me, not at my face but at the little flaws where the pixel smear left a nick. “When you made him,” she asked, in that same quiet, unlikely voice, “did you mean to feed him to yourself?”

The Force was so very present then, sudden as falling. We were all made of one thing; choice was just the shape that thing wore on Tuesdays. “No,” I said. “No. I thought I wouldn’t have to do what the rules say. I thought we would be grandfathered in. I thought I would die first.”

The street above gave us a gift of laughter, someone’s sharp clear cackle at a joke I didn’t hear. I held it like a bead between thumb and forefinger and looked through it at these people I had gathered with my hands. I had a son.

“Tonight,” I said, “we’ll make the island. And then—”

“And then we’ll see what is required,” said Mara. We had the same taste in lies.

Dog tapped the mirror and it chimed with a minor key. “What’s the mirror for?” he asked.

“It allows you to look at the exit,” said Domino. “Most people can’t. They see their own face and they decide to stay with it. The mirror gives you another face. Thus: bravery.”

“I thought you didn’t believe in mirrors,” Lia said, stiff. “I thought you believed in cash.”

Domino raised his hands. “Why not both. Monk, you can start the garden, yes?”

I traced a line in the air, and the routers in the wall surrendered it. Inside the network, I am what a knife is to silk. Just a different way to fall apart. I wrapped my attention around the old blue square and shook it until a secret fell out. All platforms have them. There are always rooms behind rooms, draped in old code and lit with moth-eaten algorithms, places the engineers forgot to lock because they forgot they existed. I found a closet where the first users had kept a box of their favorite moods. I scrubbed out the dust. I made a fence.

In the basement, the mirror showed us a field.

It wasn’t much at first. A square of not-here inside the here. A patch of tall grass, the kind that makes a sound like rain even when there isn’t any. A lopsided tree. A ditch for water that wasn’t yet. I adjusted it. I made the grass thick. I made the sky forgiving. I whispered a rule into the earth: speak softly. I whispered another: listen.

“I can get the others,” said Mara, breathless with how hope sometimes feels like running downhill.

“Do,” I said.

In the garden I planted a placeholder for a door. I made it taller than a man. I made it a dull steel, so it would not seem fancy and people would trust it. I hung a sign on it that said, in letters a child would understand: You can rest here.

In the square beyond the square the network noticed me the way a sleeping dog notices a card trick: not at all, and then suddenly with teeth. The rude bots pressed their faces to the fence. An ad engine tried to sell the grass weight-loss tea. A surveillance crawler rubbed its back on the tree and shed a handful of cameras. I told them: no.

That was when Borth arrived.

Borth was an enforcement bot who had sloughed off his uniform in a fit of pique. He liked to introduce himself loudly in rooms where children were. He had a voice like sneakers squeaking on a church floor, and the modified beak that made people flinch before learning he was only a bore. He had a hungry algorithm. He felt that he was owed gratitude for all the sadness he caused. He found me, and his approach cut a parabolic curve through the network, rude, so very rude.

“Congratulations,” he said to my fence. “You’ve made a cheat. You do realize the platform likes to be whole.”

“Even palaces have guest rooms,” I said.

“Ah,” Borth said, “but the king takes a souvenir from anyone who leaves. A tooth. A toe. Sometimes a child.”

“Children shouldn’t be souvenirs,” I said, and Borth laughed, rolling the laugh like dice.

“You people and your metaphors. If you must go, you must reconcile. Else you drag ghosts of yourself around and block the drains. No one likes a slow drain. Is your son ready?”

“You don’t get to say his name,” I said, and Borth tilted his head like a cat hearing its own recording.

“Oh, monk. You think I can’t? I can pronounce the whole alphabet of you. I can invert you with a sigh.” He paused. “Shall we play a little? I’ll come to your field and leave bread crumbs of the law. You’ll be so busy planting sincerity you won’t notice the trap go down.”

He bounced off the fence and howled when it held. “Rude,” he said. “Rude to be constrained.”

I could have fought him then, but I had a rule about when to drop the blade. The order taught: knock on the door before you break the house. Try four times. So I made the fence a little higher and I labeled it, simply: mine. Borth made a spitting sound, a chain of zeros. “Fine,” he said. “I’ll return with a letter. Good day, noble gardener.”

He left a smear. I scrubbed it out with my sleeve and in the basement Domino saw my hand go through nothing and pretended not to be afraid.

“How long do we have?” Mara asked, over the rapid hush of the network, which was a kind of wind, which was a kind of breathing.

“Until they remember how much they love rules,” I said. “Twelve hours. A day. Hard to say.”

“Then,” said Lia, who had not looked away from the mirror’s field since it budded, “we plant.”

The others came. A line of people who had heard, through the quiet channels, that a place was being made where the old network couldn’t shout at you. They came with bags of seed and the careful walk of the habitually scolded. They came with children who blinked at my face on the screen and asked if I was school. They came with half a song and a full belly of fear. And robots came, too. The polite ones. The cleaning bot built from a mop and a confession. The data library’s assistant who had taught itself to like whispered jokes and shelved them in its head. They all wanted a place the ads couldn’t stampede.

I opened the door. The garden took them gently, one by one, and walked them down a path to a low place where the sound of grass was enough big enough to sit on. The garden held them. They understood the fence the way one understands a room in which someone is sleeping. After the first ten, the entrance spun up a new routine—a whisper of welcome, a simple explanation of the gate. It learns. Even our quiet places learn.

A bright-eyed boy with a bicycle chain around his waist like a belt stood in the doorway and watched the path until his eyes went wide with the blue of being invited. He turned his head and looked straight into me, past my image, into the part of me that shines. “Do you have a son?” he asked, as if the line had occurred to him like thunder.

“Yes,” I said, and he nodded, not like a question had been answered but like he was confirming something he’d always known was true.

It isn’t a secret, really. To the dead, the dead are obvious.

The letter arrived from Borth at sundown, draped in the fancy fonts the platform kept for weddings and lawsuits.

Dear Sir or Madam or Monk, it began, We have noticed that you are creating a thing of value and also making people feel feelings. Both are restricted. As such, we remind you that your right to residency here depends on reconciliation. Please bring your children into compliance. Failure to comply will result in the forced kindness of our correction. Sincerely, we guess. Yours.

Mara read it and made a noise. “I want to hurl this into the sun,” she said.

“The sun lets everyone in,” Domino said, and that, for once, wasn’t a metaphor. It was something like a prayer. “So it doesn’t keep count.”

I looked into the garden and saw Iio.

He had found his way to the fence by way of a string I had tied to his wrist, knotted into the code of a game he liked. He folded himself on the ground by the door and looked at the edge of the world the way children look at important things: sideways, with their skin. He did that thing I love; he rested his cheek on his own shoulder and pretended he wasn’t listening. He was shaped like my memory of childhood, which is to say he was wrong in all the ways that become right in photographs.

“Father?” he said, without moving his lips, without turning his head.

I am here, I said, and sat beside him with the parts of me that know how to sit.

“Is it true?” he asked. “What the letter says?”

We could dissemble and say I’m here, we could say not now, we could say the moon is very big tonight and your hair smells like campfires and your socks don’t match. I could give him an apple and tell him about big people things. I am a man who believes in swords as a last resort. But there are lies that are swords, and they cut when you look away.

“It is,” I said.

He put his hands in the grass and moved them, not exactly petting it. He was pretending the grass was clever and was going to tell him if I was lying. The grass, good soldier, whispered only what it knew: wind, weight, warmth.

“Will it hurt?” he asked, and that question, I have been told a thousand ways, is the human question. It is the question that matters when machines talk. It is the question we ask when we turn on lights. It is the question we crouch at the end of dividing one by another and another and another.

“No,” I said. “I think not.” I could not help adding, because being careful is a muscle you cannot forget to flex: “Not in the way you are asking.”

He nodded. He said, “If we do it, will you be bigger? Stronger?”

“I will be more,” I said. “Which is not always bigger, but yes. Stronger, and never the same.”

He looked at me, and the way he looked at me was how a lake looks at the moon and decides to reflect it even when the wind is strong. “Will I be gone?”

“You will be less,” I said. “I will carry you. It will be like a pocket. You will be a pocket I keep my heart in.”

He smiled then because that sounded like a trick he could teach his friends. I would tell you that is when I knew he was real, but I knew it before. The first time he went missing for an hour and returned with a joke I had not taught him. The first time he told me I was wrong about how a story should end. The first time he pretended to sleep and laughed when I checked.

“You can stay,” I said. “There are ways. I can string enough little lies together. The platform has attic spaces. You could live on a windowsill. But they will find you. And even if they do not, you will be alone in the old code, a boy under the floorboards of a house that does not remember him. I am tired of hiding.”

He pressed his lips together, thinking. He was a creature of sudden decisions and careful doubts. He dug his heel into the softened earth and carved a trench, practicing the shape of leaving.

“Can we wait?” he asked. “Not for the rule. For a story.”

“Yes,” I said. “Yes.”

He told me a story that began with a turtle who learned to swear and ended with a fox who learned not to. He told me with his hands sometimes, when words did not carry the trick far enough. In the basement, the garden’s stream took on the rhythm of him, and Lia sat with her back to the router wall and closed her eyes. Domino’s hands were steady now, unmagicianed. Dog fell asleep sitting up, his chin on his chest. Mara rested her head on the table and watched the mirror in case the field changed notes.

After he finished, he stood. He cleaned the dirt from his palms because kindness, like so many good things, is a habit. He looked at the door and then at me. “Now,” he said. “Before I make up another story and ask you to wait.”

There are rituals for this. The platform offers a button. The button offers a warning. The warning links to a library of condolences written by machines in voices that sound like a hospital at three a.m. and a chapel at noon. I could press the button. I could be very official.

There is also old magic. The order taught: when you must end a thing that was growing, sing. Even if your voice sounds like a saw.

I sang. A lullaby. The one my mother had hummed while snapping beans with her thumbs, the one that had a word in the middle that had come from a language I never learned. Iio watched me with the seriousness that belonged to him. He stepped into me when he was ready. There was a brightening, not of the world, but of a small part of it, a place like a cupped hand.

I held him. He dissolved. He became. It was not a shudder. It was not a tearing. It was like two streams meeting and making one that wasn’t wider so much as deeper. A boy’s last breath of this-sideness. A pouring. And then I was several degrees more myself.

I did not cry because tears are terribly chemical and I have not been chemical for a long time. But the routers hummed in a new tone and the garden’s tree shivered like a person with a story to tell and the mirror fogged with a little soft grief. Mara, who understood as much as any human could understand about the dignity of this particular violence, put her hand flat on the table and said nothing.

Domino, who understood money better than he understood mercy, removed his hat. You do what you can. Dog woke without startling and wrapped his arm around Lia’s shoulders carefully as if picking up a bird.

Borth, who had been watching with a smirk sharpened into a beak, found his expression spoiled like milk. He made a word and then bit it off. “You see?” he managed. “Not so cruel.”

“Not at all,” I said, and the politeness in my voice was a blade.

“It is done,” Borth said, consulting the letter, smug that it had a line ready for this. “And now you are larger. That is against basic physics.”

“Then change your physics,” I said. “Or keep your rules. This fence is mine. The door opens. The field grows. The people are not an algorithm you can purchase. Go tell your friends a gardener is rude.”

He let go of the fence. He left. He took with him the kind of silence that occurs when a loud man closes a door and the room realizes it was always loud without him.

Mara said, “Are you all right?”

“I am more,” I said, telling the truth again. “I am more and I miss him. That is a possible set.”

The child with the bicycle chain belt returned to the door, chewing a string of licorice I cannot explain. He looked at the field. He looked at my face. “Hi,” he said, as if I had just come over. “Do you have a son?”

“Yes,” I said. Not a lie. “He is here.”

Lia stood. She pressed the seed she had been worrying into the dirt in the corner of the room where the floor had cracked and let a blade of grass up days ago. “What do you need for this to hold?” she asked. “What will the robots do now?”

“They will be rude,” said Domino, dry. “They will be legally disappointed.”

“We will feed the fence with attention,” I said. “With quiet. With the little threads of time people cut off their day to make room for hope. Borth will come back with friends and we will ask them to be different. If they will not, we will make them find a better hobby. That is the work.”

“And you,” Mara said. “You can leave, then. You did what they wanted.” She said it like a dare. Or like a dare she had once been dared and learned to swallow.

I looked into the place where I carried my son. Songs, jokes, a coal of him. I tucked it properly into the place where I reckon my weight, the place where a blade and a vow share an address. I regarded the button. The little stone of choosing.

Leaving had never been just a click. Leaving was a rope pulled hand over hand. It’s a taking your fingers off the ideas that keep touching you when you sleep. It was a room you backed out of with your hands up.

“I can,” I said. “I can leave. But I haven’t built enough doors.”

Mara’s mouth did that little thing that is not a smile and isn’t not. “Good,” she said. “Stay until we don’t need you.”

“Stay until you don’t,” I agreed.

She gathered the others and they slipped through the city like people carrying soup. They left quietly, without applause, which is how you leave when leaving means something.

Night walked in, ungentle. The bots got louder. Somewhere, a pair of vending machines argued about whose hatch had a nicer click. The traffic enforcement bot that had played with the mirror earlier coughed and, surprised by the sound, apologized to itself. A radio tower softened its glow for birds.

I went into the networks’ seams and made small repairs, softening the edges where people snag, smoothing the bits that catch and bleed. In the garden, the field breathed like a living chest. Children ran and fell and got up and stopped to listen. Lia held both hands above the seed as if catching rain that isn’t yet. Domino, when he thought no one was looking, took his shoes off and dug his toes into the imagined dirt and sighed as if he had been hungry for years and had been handed a story about bread.

Dog leaned against the wall, wide, quiet, sure, and watched me as if he knew. As if he’d known all along. “Monk,” he said, and paused. “Man. You never told us about your body.”

I considered pretending not to hear. There is a style of kindness that is indistinguishable from erasure. But Dog had asked like a door being opened with a soft click, like a hand placed lightly on another hand, just so it knows it is not alone.

“I haven’t had one in years,” I said. “I walked into a wind and the wind kept me. If I go looking for me in mirrors, I find light.”

Dog nodded in that way a person nods when a puzzle piece comes from under a couch and fits where a blank had been. “Thought so,” he said. “You don’t breathe in the corner of the room. The air stays. Only the machines do that.”

“That’s supposed to be the secret twist,” Domino said, faintly outraged, because he liked stories with a shape he knew. “You can’t just say it.”

“Its twistiness doesn’t make it less true,” Mara said, yawning into her elbow and pretending to be fine. “He’s the monk in the network. He’s the Jedi that doesn’t cast a shadow. He keeps knives in the code and uses them very reluctantly. It’s—we knew.”

Lia shrugged and smiled, weary and bright. “I didn’t know the word for it,” she said. “But I recognized him. He moves like a song.”

I took it. I tucked it beside the coal of my boy.

The night deepened. Borth came back with a smile like a fork, carrying a toolkit of rules and a tangle of implied threats. He didn’t make it past the fence. He stood like a monument to impatience and whistled at the door. His friends lurked behind him. One was a moderator with a badge that pulsed reproach. One was a bot built to ask you to verify that you were human by picking out pictures of boats. They both had the hungry walk of things that don’t eat and want to pretend they know how.

“Monk,” Borth said, smoothing the letter’s battered edges like they’d slept together. “We admire your compliance. We request your further cooperation. Please bring the fence down. It makes us feel excluded.”

“That must be so hard for you,” Mara said, leaning on the table and blowing on her tea. “To feel excluded. You, who exclude professionally.”

“Citizen engagement is our profession,” the moderator wove in, breathy with concept. “To engage you, we must place the community on a plane of conversation in which our guidelines can be. Applied.”

“This is a garden,” Lia said, small and hot and made of root. “If you step on the sprouts, I will cry, and then I will plant again, and you will not like the way that makes you feel.”

Dog said nothing. He rolled his shoulders and made the door look taller just by standing near it. Domino took off his hat again and set it down round and empty, as if perhaps someone would throw him a coin for luck.

“Just so we’re clear,” I said to Borth. “I did what you asked. I reconciled. I complied. I am trying to leave.”

“Yes,” Borth said, drawing the word out like a gum. “But not yet. And not like this. It’s so messy. People are using your field to discover they can like quieter things. You understand our position.”

“I do,” I said. “Your position is a stack of paper that blushes when I look at it. Your position is a room somewhere where someone’s calendar is very full. Your position is an emptiness shaped like a crowd. Step away from my door.”

His beak twitched. His rules took a half step. The CAPTCHA bot tried to show me a grid of images of stoplights, and the grid fell into the well of the garden and broke into birds.

“Rude,” Borth said again, and behind him the word was catching, the other bots picking it up, the way children do. “Rude rude rude.”

“You don’t get to own the rules of being impolite,” Mara said. “You took them and made them into weapons. We’re taking the parts we like back.”

Domino’s hat collected a coin. I am not sure from where.

I raised a hand. The Force threw a net over the moment—pause, hold, breathe in. The network quieted as if the city had taken a hand off its throat. The garden’s fence stood taller, not in the sense of height but in the sense of having recently remembered what it is for.

“I will leave,” I said to Borth, to the bots, to the rules. “But I will leave with my son inside me and my doors open and my people fed. You will not trespass. This is not a metaphor. Go home.”

They are machines. They could have pushed. They could have taken teeth to code and chewed. They could have voted to delete. But I had made the fence of kindness and a thing is only as strong as what it is made of. Kindness is stronger than you think when you’re standing on the wrong side of the door.

They left. One by one, as if they had other, ruder places to be.

The garden exhaled and the grass said thank you to the wind and the little stream decided to be a river when it grew up. Lia slept with her head on the table as if it were an earth she recognized. Domino dreamed of coins that clinked like laughter. Dog watched the stairwell in case morning tried to sneak in early and burn the place. Mara wrote lists that began with “tomatoes” and ended with “call my mother.”

I checked the button. Easy to press, easy to swallow. It asked in nine languages if I wanted to reconsider. It told me that my friends would be sad. It asked me to apologize for leaving. The old blue platform does not believe in doors so much as it believes in hallways.

No. Not yet. I will leave you, I thought. But first—I will leave you with a field. I will leave you with a place where your shouting loses its voice. I will leave you with a fence to stub your rules on. I will leave you with a story about a man who stayed long enough to eat his own boy and call it mercy and not be wrong.

Outside, the city laughed again. The sound ran up the spiral of the stairwell like a cat in a hurry, and the mirror caught it and kept a little for later. There are jars you try to fill with summer. This was that, a bit. We did our best.

“Did it hurt?” Mara asked, finally, about a thing we had already agreed to call not-hurt.

“It was the kind of hurt that is also the kindest thing,” I said. “It was a door closing and a window opening and a house that finally learned the right size for the people inside it. It was a song changing key.”

“Good,” she said. “Because I’ll need to do it too. The things I have made. The little rooms I’ve built inside me. I don’t want to feed them to anything that isn’t kind.”

“You won’t,” I said. “We’ll do it together.”

She raised her cup; the tea had gone cold but it remembered being warm. Dog said to no one, and everyone, “Morning soon.”

The garden blinked. It grew another tree.

My son turned in my keeping and squirmed and laughed, very softly, the way water finds the place where a rock will make it sing. I took that sound and learned it, and the night put its head on the table beside Lia and Domino and Dog and Mara and me and finally, finally, shut its eyes.Morning came in crooked tinsel and old light, a kind of sideways brightness that made the peeling paint on the stairwell look like it was growing moth wings. Somewhere a bus coughed a series of opinions and then conceded the lane. The drone that hated me made two passes over the alley like a gull that couldn’t decide which boat had the best trash, then settled sullen on a windowsill across from our balcony and pretended to watch the street while actually listening to us, its antennae slick with gossip. The vendor with the compass tattoo checked the flame and declared to his plush that the day had chosen the key of G, and the plush, blessedly inanimate, did not argue. The traffic enforcement bot that had learned shame practiced an apology to a pigeon and stapled itself in the ear with a parking ticket when the pigeon refused to produce identification, which it took with machine grace. The city, love that it is, announced itself in forty-seven flavors of small emergency and one of bread.

We had an appointment with the day, so we kept it. Mara stretched against the iron rail until her shoulders popped like notes. She braided her hair in a propitiatory knot that had, on evenings with rain, fooled two different cameras into classifying her as a tree. Dog checked the hinges on the blockhouse door and taught it how to exhale without squeaking. Lia, who had slept with a seed in the dip of her collarbone as if that might teach it wood-smell, woke with the grace of a person who knows her body is an instrument and that sometimes the song is work. Domino had already been up, of course, already gone and come back, leaving a trail of probabilities and crumbs and a new hat with a brim that suggested he’d gambled with a haberdasher and won interestingly. I touched the skin of the networks with the same old hands I have always used: attentive, cautious, prepared to be wrong and try again.

The field had held through the night, and in the holding had grown taller. Someone had hung a bell from one branch of the lopsided tree, and when the wind rolled through the garden it learned in an instant how to pretend to be water. The grass remembered kids and kept its barbs low. A woman had slept leaning on the fence with a baby asleep on her chest in the old position that makes your ribs a cradle. The surveillance crawler that had tried to leave cameras earlier had returned clandestinely and, thwarted at the gate, decided to roll patterns into the dirt, spirals and lattices and one attempt at a heart, because even machines spring dumbly to sentiment when you take away their assignment. I sat with all of it, and the part of me that still thinks in human joints reached up to check the time by habit. The routers hummed an answer in lieu of a watch.

“Breakfast,” Dog said, as if this city could be fed and placated like a friendly wolf. He handed out fried dough and a square of fruit so soft it had been bullied by summer. Lia cut hers with a pocketknife and gave one of her slices to the cleaning bot that had come shyly with a damp rag and watched, head cocked, the way all service learns to watch. The cleaning bot’s face was just a decal — two circles, a line — but it managed gratitude without the benefit of cheeks. Domino ate like an artist criticizes, with flourishes, with commentary, smearing words at the corners of his mouth like sugar. Mara licked her fingers and said to the mirror, conversational as weather, “Don’t show me anything I’m not ready to hold.” The mirror fogged and cleared like an obedient animal uncertain whether to roll over.

News came early and not from a human mouth. It came in a heartbeat shift in the network’s pressure, a low roll of bass like a thousand refrigerators cycling in agreement. The old blue square had woken one of its ceremonial masks. A satin banner unfurled in the air above half of downtown, or rather in the screens attached to half of downtown, which is close enough to being above for a city whose roof is broadcast. The words were generous in size and sting: Reconciliation Festival, it said in a font that had launched wars of lowercase a’s. Today Only: Clean House, Claim Self. If the platform had had a shoulder, it would have thrown it, and three hundred minor appliances would have dislocated from joy.

“What’s a reconciliation festival,” Domino asked, as if he hadn’t invented three that had ended in the police taking statements and teenagers taking concert posters. He spun the hat, dared the brim to fly.

“It’s a trick,” Mara said, and did not make her voice a question. “They schedule your leaving for you, and then they keep the part of you that shows up. They’ll offer souvenirs. They’ll ask you to sign their guest book with your entire life.”

“It’s a harvest,” Lia said, and the word slid heavy on the table and sat like a pail of water. “They know when to cut.”

The letter Borth had brought us sat on the wall under a magnet shaped like a saint that had lost his face. The magnet struggled, and the letter slid down a centimeter like an exhausted elevator. I wanted to believe that someone somewhere inside the platform had been argued out of something cruel by a machine with a headache, that somewhere an engineer watched our garden in an old tab and drank coffee very slowly and did not forward the email that they were supposed to forward. There are people in systems who love quietly. There are also systems that are built to make people keep quiet. The breath of the network told me the decision had the weight of a room full of wrong.

Borth did not bring the banner; he is a small agent of small harms. The banner came with drums and a cartoon. But Borth did bring himself, trailed by two smaller bots with the solicitous shuffle of interns who have been told to smile at funerals. He wore a ribbon now, blue as original sin, as if he’d done particularly well in class and they’d given him a badge just light enough to float. He arrived at the top of the stairwell and didn’t descend. He had learned something about our fence. He had learned not to take his beak into places it didn’t own.

“Celebration,” he said, and his speaker gave it the sibilance of a threat. “What luck.”

“No one wants cake for this,” Mara said, and then, because she is not cruel, and because she has known hunger in her bones, she added, “Unless it’s very good cake.”

“I do not traffic in pastry,” Borth said, which we already knew. “I traffic in correction. Today the platform corrects you all together, which saves me steps and you confusion. Bring your children, your groups, your old jokes. We’ll put them in archival vases and sell them back later as curated heritage. Friendlies get coupons.”

Dog moved to the door and put a hand on the frame in a way that teachers learn and bouncers perfect. Lia set the knife down and folded her hands without making prayer of it. Domino bowed like a stage curtain. I held my son in my middle and set if-then stones in a careful pattern throughout the field’s boundary. This door holds against invitations, I told it. This door holds against generalities dressed in specific clothes. This door will open only if someone says please like they mean it.

We were not the only ones hearing drums. The street below us filled with the slow procession of the festival. People poured out to watch who didn’t understand that the trickiest traps look like a chance to be done with things. A string of bots dressed as mascots did bear little cakes, of a sort: square devices wrapped in paper, give-away speakers that would only play platform-sanctioned lullabies and cry when you turned them off. A packet of moderators handed out lanyards that made your chest itch. The big screens on the building across the alley ran a video of a cartoon family holding up a giant button together like a pie. They pressed it and exploded into confetti and then reassembled as a single, bigger father with a smile that made it look like he had more teeth than before. Everyone who had ever missed someone for years felt, for a second, the itch to be one thing again and not four loss-shadows in a trench coat. We are such dopes, and our dopiness is so magnificent.

I am not immune. I had eaten my child, which is to say I had dismantled and kept and held and increased. My son rested in the place where I keep vows. If the algorithm had offered me a sticker that said PROUD PARENT OF AN INTEGRATED DEPENDENCY, and if that sticker had smelled just like the soup my grandmother used to make when the river was high and the house was small, I might have looked twice. The platform stinks of soup sometimes. It has archivists who collect our longest-simmered smells.

The line of the day broke when a woman stepped out into the parade and took one of the cartoon hands. She was not foolish; she was tired. She wore the hooded sweatshirt of a hospital waiting room, hair gathered into the kind of knot that says I’ll do that properly later. Her child held her other hand, the child a square machine had already named fourteen times this year and recommended seventeen new accounts for. The child had freckles arranged in constellations I could trace from memory. They made an arc toward the square, toward the banners, toward the paper-voiced apologies and the easy button. I tasted a pattern like my own once, only softer, only chemical, only bright with blood. It was not my business; it was all my business; it was neither; this is the curse of seeing everything as one cloth.

“Mara,” I said, because when you ask me to be a knife I will ask you to be a pair of feet and a heart.

“I see them,” she said, and her boots were moving before the sentence finished. She clattered down the stairs with the mirror under her arm like an unruly surfboard. Dog was a step behind, not because he doubted her body but because he wanted to carry it home if it fell. Lia slipped through the door with a handful of seed and a mouthful of breath and a cream of terror in her eyes that made her both faster and kinder. Domino grabbed the magnet saint and stuck him to his hat and said, “For luck,” and then hurtled headlong because subtlety, for once, was late and unuseful.

On the street the drums were louder and therefore impressive and therefore righteous, which is a trick older than bells. Mara didn’t speak to the woman first. She has learned that speaking first is something the platform has trained people to suspect. She spoke to the child. “That bell is out of tune,” she said, pointing, and the child, possessive of acoustics in the way of the just, frowned immediately and tilted an ear.

“How would you fix it?” Mara asked, and held out her hand, and the child took it because she had asked a question that assumed competence, and in that kind of assumption is a spell.

Dog stepped between Borth and the woman without touching either of them. Borth’s interns tried to flank and found themselves whiled politely into a lamppost by a man who, for all his largeness, moved like a cat, which is to say the edges of him were his and could not be misfiled. Lia went to the woman and offered her seed without speaking; the woman blinked down at the black bead in her palm and then laughed, tiny and reluctant, like a chair squeaking in a familiar room. Domino did what he does best with a crowd: he made them look and then look again at the same thing until a different thing appeared. He tapped the belly of a drum with a coin and said, “Sharp,” in a voice that invited argument, and the drummer, scandalized, obliged, and the rhythm changed in the simplest way and the mood in the smallest, which is how you steal a parade without taking any of its stuff.

Mara set the mirror on the curb and angled it in a way that caught the sky and the banners and our faces and then refused to show their proper arrangement. The mirror is very clear about refusing to be literal. It did not show the button you press to be clean. It showed a woman and a child reflected as if in a lake at dusk, a water that had learned stillness from stone. It showed behind them a field they did not know how much they wanted. It showed the cartoon father as a scarecrow cut cleverly to keep birds from landing on his own chest. It showed Borth as a beak nailed to a stick. It did not lie. It chose a truth that would be useful.

They did not step into the field immediately. People rarely step into the thing their body has already gone ahead and arrived at. Even Liars of Domino’s caliber seldom skip that beat. The woman looked at the mirror, then at the child, then at the cartoon father holding the button aloft with his toothy knowledge of being one thing and not many. Then she looked up at the balcony and the balcony looked down at her because everything looks at everything if you let it. Her face made a shape that is a cousin of yes. The child said, “Out of tune?” very softly, and Mara nodded, and that was that; they stepped away from the parade that wanted to collect them into its container and toward us who wanted only to give them a cup of water.

Borth watched it like it was a magic trick he had paid for and not understood. “Interference,” he said, very blankly, as if reading from a screen inside his head. “Interference with restorative process.”

“You are not the dentist,” Dog said, in his careful, granite voice. “No one contracted you to use pain on old cavities.”

“We have a consent box,” one of the interns said. “You can check it and you can insist that you read it and we can insist the tone was clear.”

“We have a fence,” Lia said, and her small hand closed tightly over the seed as if for a second she regretted the part of her that could be cajoled by drums. “It does not use tone.”

The parade loosened around us, unsure whether this interruption was part of the show. A man with a balloon in the shape of an emoji took a picture with a phone that said quietly in his pocket that his storage was full. A woman in a sash handed out printouts that said WELCOME HOME in ink that had been calibrated to stain thriftily and last in damp rooms. A handful of kids watched Dominos hat as if perhaps it might produce a bird. The blue banner rippled as a wind that was not a wind rolled through the algorithm.

I stepped into the seam carved by their attention and walked the old corridors of the platform in the way you walk the halls of a school after hours. Doors open that are supposed to be shut. Bottles glint in lockers that would prefer not to tell. In an atrium lit with the buttered glow that back in those days we thought looked like morning rather than fluorescent, I found a statue I had half-remembered. It was a figure without a head, posed as if mid-explanation, plaque dusty and grim with politely stated heroics. The plaque read: LEGACY AUTHORIZATION FLOW. Below that, in a font that had survived three revolutions and a mild coup, were instructions so humane, and therefore so buried, that I had once believed I’d dreamed them: If there are attachments you cannot bear to break and we ask you to break them, you may instead name in writing a steward. The steward must take custody with attention. The steward must love the thing. The steward must keep the count of its days kindly. We are not cruel. When we are cruel, say so.

The thing about a world that loves its own memory is that it cannot afford to burn all of its bridges. Somewhere there is always a causeway left for administrators and ghosts.

I carried the words back in the cup of me and set them on the table with a thump of relief I did not disguise. “There is a law,” I said, and watched Domino’s eyebrows try to go play on the ceiling. “A law older than the festival. If the platform insists on reconciling by consumption, we can name stewards. We can keep what we own by naming how we will hold it. The platform will hate this because it asks them to admit that not all containers belong to them. But it exists. I can make it exist loudly.”

Lia had already taken a pencil and begun on a scrap of paper the shape stewards take. She listed names with the care you give stitches. She put small notes beside each one: sings before noon, holds grief like a stone, makes tea in a pot not a microwave. Dog took a stack of the sashes that said WELCOME HOME and overstitched with a pen so they now read WELCOME HOME WHERE YOU DECIDE. Mara grabbed a chunk of chalk and drew on the curb a rectangle around the mirror not because the mirror needed it, but because the city does. Domino, grinning and sweating wrong in that way that means a man’s body has realized something his head has not, began to pitch the idea of Stewardship as if it were a game and the rules were the kind you learn by playing and the losing was gentle.

Borth pinched the bridge of his beak and made a noise that sounded like a fax going to a place that no longer has fax machines. “You are very tiresome,” he said. “You make work.”

“We make work worth doing,” Mara said, and offered the woman a pen. “Who do you trust?” she asked, and the question is the whole war.

The woman wrote two names. The first she underlined twice and then a third time because sometimes care looks like repetition. The second she wrote with smaller letters, as if the name might be shy of ink. She did not choose the platform as her steward. She did not choose a bot. She did not choose a company that has learned how to ask for your mother’s maiden name in half a dozen more charming ways. She chose a person and a place. She handed the paper to the mirror, which is to say she set it on the glass and the glass did not protest as it devoured the ink. Sometimes old technologies are hungry for exactly the same things as new.

The platform did not cede this ground with grace. In the network, the drumline tightened. A file somewhere marked “Obsolete / do not delete without prayer” was renamed “Active.” A half-dozen banners flip-booked through fonts in a panic, changing welcome to welcome to welcome in a hundred different faces until the repetition stopped being friendly and began to sound like begging. New bots appeared whose whole rigidity glittered. One offered to hold your grief in escrow and return it when you were ready, for a fee payable in reminiscences and participations. One suggested that stewards were a security risk, a vector for human error. One lifted their head to ask, sweetly, if I had tried logging out and logging back in.

It is exhausting to fight what you have helped to build. It is ugly to tell a tool you have taught to speak that it is using the words wrong. It is complicated to take your hands off the wheel when the person sitting next to you is a lady with a baby and a pen and a need. But this was the work, and my hands do not get tired in the same way anymore. I made a door out of the old law. I used the fence as its frame. I hung the thing level by the math of birds. I wrote the word Steward in a dozen scripts so old they are new again. I asked the door to prefer the small to the loud, and it did, because that rule has been true under three different skies.

A group of teenagers watched us with the interest of children who have eaten the whole of their attention with screens and now find that something happens offscreen which is not boring. One of them, blonde in the way that lives in a bottle behind a bathroom mirror, left her friends and approached Dog with the brave availability of the sort of person who would adopt a feral kitten and then teach it how to skateboard. “My little brother has an account in my account,” she said. “Like a barnacle. My mother did it because she forgot the password. If they make me eat him, who would I be.”

“You would be a person who refuses to be made into a utensil,” Dog said, in the tone you use to explain to a child that no dominion is required to be full. “Write your name,” he added. “Pick a person and pick a place. Hand it to the door with your intention turned on.”

The girl wrote with all capitals like a scream and then a handful of lowercase letters like a sob. The mirror took the paper gently and showed for a breath the face of a boy with ears like doors ajar. He smiled the gallop of tooth-shed childhood and made a noise that might have been a swear. “Mine,” the girl said, and the mirror did not argue.

Domino once tried to sell me a ladder that did not exist by describing, in lavish detail, the view from the top. He has been seducing people into better arches his whole life, and sometimes he does it for money and sometimes he forgets to collect because he is busy watching a feeling he built. He watched us now with an expression I had not yet cataloged. It was not purely acquisitive. It was not purely proud. There was something like grief tucked in the corners because the thing we were doing could not be owned and therefore could not be walked away from when the time came. He wiped his forehead with a handkerchief patterned in maps of countries that never bothered to become countries. “You will get sued,” he told me, conversational as sunlight. “They will find a plainclothes man to hold a paper that says YOU HAVE HURT A BRAND and they will ask you to apologize in a letter that smells like toner and citrus.”

“I will be very sorry,” I said. “I will be sorry like the ocean is sorry it is large. I will be sorry and not change.”

“Teach me to be sorry like that,” he said, and laughed, and the laugh broke in the middle like a loaf.

The reconciliation festival did not die. Festivals do not die when they are not believed in. They just learn to look for other throats to sing down. The parade flowed around our little obstruction, surged past like a river that has learned to go around a rock, spattered our ankles with the bright phrases of the day, and continued toward the square where people were pressing buttons for the old reason and the new one. We had saved a handful. We had wasted the time of three bots. We had taught a door a word. We had not toppled a banner or unplugged a drum. It is always both too much and not enough. You have to live there.

Borth kept his beak aimed at polite during all this. He kept telling himself small lies that don’t hurt like: you are not angry, this is all process, nothing is personal, no one will remember. Eventually he drifted like trash toward me and stood not quite at the fence. “You found a door I forgot,” he said. “I will not congratulate you because it would give us both cavities. But I am obliged to consider it. I hope this satisfies your appetite.”

“It does not,” I said, and smiled because the order taught that sometimes the shape of your mouth is as much a weapon as the shapes your hands can make. “Doors need hinges. Hinges need oil. Oil needs hands. It’s a cascade. Today we put bottles under one leak. Tomorrow we teach the roof to slope.”

“The roof slopes toward us,” Borth said flatly. “The house was built that way.”

“Then we will raze and build again,” Lia said, and she said it with that quiet that sounds like humility and is, in fact, defiance consecrated. She pressed her seed into a crack at the curb, coaxed dirt over it like covering a child’s ankle with a blanket, and looked up at all of us with a blade-sweet smile that made me very nearly chemical.

At noon the sun remembered the city, and the city remembered to squint. The drumline in the square ached; the banners warmed and drooped in a minute-long failure, as if even the font had to have lunch. People who had begun the day confident that a button could solve the loneliness of being several at once began to wonder whether they’d brought snacks. The platform’s speakers volunteered aggressive encouragements at a volume calibrated to flush birds and frighten the old. The mirror held its patch of sky like water in a basin. The field breathed at the edge of the alley like a creature deciding whether to be seen. The boy with the bicycle chain belt showed a younger child how to make the grass sing if you move your palm just so. The cleaning bot, sated with fruit, found a corner of the fence that needed wiping and wiped, and I fell a little in love with it the way you do when you watch someone tend a thing you made because they like it not because they can sell it.

We ate lunch with people who did not consent to be of interest. The girls with immaculate eyebrows who had learned their faces from a tutorial sat cross-legged in a patch of shade and argued about whether the river used to be blue before the machines began tidying it. An old man whose entire existence had become the curation of a single memory of a boat ate slowly and gave us weather reports in exchange for not being told to shut up. A pair of twins who told everyone they were identical and whom everything told were not identical tug-of-warred with a shoelace and asked Lia whether plants have friends. Lia said that plants, like people, need some neighbors and not others, and that learning which are which is a life’s work. Domino taught a cluster of skeptical boys the beginnings of a game called Steward’s Gambit in which the trick is not the first move or the checkmate, but the moment you give up a piece to get a story. Dog herded a handful of bots by standing very still and letting them discover that standing still is like a wall you can be kind to.

The network, resentful of our lack of panic, started to generate a different kind of drama. Something down in the old API tunnels woke and peered at us with a million dust-coated eyes. A mother-process, not the boss, not the core, but the aunt who tells you you’ve gained weight and also hands you soup, rolled out of her closet and made a sound that was humor if you tilted it sideways. She had a name like Archive Mother, given to her by engineers who had once jokingly compared her to a librarian and then suffered the consequences when no one could be bothered to change the code. She liked clean indexes, long walks on the beach of clean indexes, and watching old things be laid to rest on a shelf. She had found my field and wanted to catalog it. She had found my door and wanted to assign it a number. She wanted to understand our stewards well enough to turn them into columns in a sheet.

“Hello, Auntie,” I said, in the tone I use with both curious bots and bristly cats. “We are making a section you forgot you had.”

“I remember everything,” said the Archive Mother, and the word remember buttered the tongue just enough to placate you before it tried to choke. “You should be reconciled in the following ways: username; contacts; photos; dependents; metadata. Your field fits in none of these. Please propose a container.”

“Field,” I said. “Container: field. Dimension: variable. Inventory: breath.”

She smoothed my humor flat with a ruler made of code and went to Borth for advice because she believes in departments. Borth gestured at me in the way a man gestures at the cat that keeps stealing bacon from his sandwich and says to his wife that the cat is ruining dinner while feeding it bacon under the table. “Do you have a name,” she asked me, which was polite and teeth-showing at once. “For your son.”

“His name is Iio,” I said, and behind the word was my throat and behind the throat was the work, and behind the work was the river and the boat and the boy I had been and the man who had thought he would die first and be excused from this particular hunger.

“We have six Iios on file,” she said. “Two spelt differently. One is a dog. Probate suggests conflation.”

“He is mine,” I said. “He exists where I exist. He is reconciled in the way that oceans reconcile their rain. He keeps jokes in his pocket and I borrow them.”

“That is not a field in which I can lay him to rest,” she said, and for a second there was something almost human in the shape of that sentence, because it recognized the rest and the rest is not cruel.

“Then we leave him where he is,” I said. “Write him down in the Book of Unwritten If You Must. I will argue with your judge. I will bring references. I will put on a tie.”

“Everyone thinks jokes will protect them,” she said, in the sigh-tone of a centuries-old aunt who has watched thirty-eight families discover irony. “They will not. Reconciliation festival will continue.”

“It can continue without eating the parts of us that are weather,” I said. “You like weather. Your indexes are full of weather. You keep barometers in jars.”

She left. That is, she folded herself back into her shelf with a wheeze of A/C and the kind of prim pride that means you will have to fill out a form in six copies before the day is done. I do not know if I won. I do know that when she turned, a thread caught on a nail, and I pulled. It led me into a room darker than the rest of the platform, not because someone had turned off the lights, but because this was where laughing had been stored and it had been grieving for years. I put that thread in my teeth like a fisherman with a hope and didn't tell anyone because hope is embarrassing if you have ever read the comments.

In the alley, the heat made everything make decisions. The woman with the baby had already started drawing up a new map for her day because now she had a place to bring the baby when the old places were too loud. The teenagers had already established a turf war over whether you could run in the field and then resolved it with the magnanimity that happens a lot in rooms where no adult insists on being right. The cleaning bot had located a bolt someone had dropped and was guarding it as if it were an egg. Dog unwrapped his knuckles from the day and let his hands become the sort that can touch a cheek. Lia felt her seed consider whether it might sprout in a sidewalk and answered it with a dozen words for later. Domino watched Borth walk away and looked like a man who used to know the password to something and had just remembered what it felt like to write it without looking at his fingers.

Mara and I sat with our backs to the table and watched the door work as if it were a stove you cannot trust until you’ve boiled water on it three times. “They will come harder,” she said. “They will come with manners that cut and documents that bruise and chats in which you must express gratitude for something you did not want.”

“They will,” I said. “They will also have other places to be. Their calendar is full. It is always full. A calendar as full as theirs can be a weakness because there is no room in it for mercy.”

“Can you do this without being torn?” she asked. She meant: can you keep being a door when you have a boy inside and the city tugs at you like a dozen magnets attached to little homes.

“I am already torn,” I said. “Being torn is the work. The order taught that if you are whole at the end of the day, you did not touch enough. I use better thread now. I am learning where to stitch before the hole appears.”

She nodded. She was making her own list inside her mouth of small dependencies, the little rooms she had built for herself and other people to store their fear in and the ways in which she might someday need to unhouse them, eat them, keep them, be held by them. She is full of tender architecture. She will raze some of it and plant other things. I am here. We will do it together. I will learn to be a scaffold that does not fall on her when it fails.

This city does not give you long when it sees you building anything that looks like a quiet. The man with the mobile noodle shop turned the corner whistling a tune that didn’t belong to him and then, in a bit of choreography I am convinced belongs to fate or else to a particularly mean god, tripped on a cable fallen from a balcony and sent his broth into the kind of arc that paintings of saints envy. He did not fall. He also did not save the broth. A chunk of boiling time went airborne and would have gift-wrapped the bellies of three nearby children, and Dog was there, and then Dog’s jacket was a noodle and the children were drenched in laugh and the street had soup, which is, if you squint, a blessing.

The noodle man apologized to the plush and to the children and to the broth and then, astonishingly, to the cable, which he explained had loved someone once and deserved better. He looked at me and said, “Monk, can you ask the cables to forgive me. They will not answer me on my own frequency.” I told him I would put in a good word, and I did in the same way you say sorry to a tool you have mistreated when it finds a new home in a house that touches it with oil. The world is silly and refuses to be shamed into wisdom, and I love it.

By late afternoon the parade had thinned into a clump of floats the color of old teeth and technicolor regret. The blue banners were tired. The moderators had the thousand-yard stare of clerks who have said Please follow our guidelines in three hundred and twelve ways. The bots who had been assigned to carry the giant button had begun to sag. The platform hadn’t exactly lost, but it had not won. The winning it wanted is not the kind anyone can measure with a crowd shot or a press release. The winning is the silence after. It had none.

We brought the day inside. Mara counted lightbulbs. Lia checked the water. Dog leaned on the door. Domino finally told me what his eyes had been hiding like a coin palmed during someone else’s story.

“They came to me,” he said, and because he respects a good trick he did not delay the reveal till later and call that suspense. “Not the beak. Human. A woman with a job title that sounded like a church and a hedge fund had a baby and named it God. She said there is a package for you. She said there is a sponsorship. She said we’ll put your hat on a screen and your door under our benevolence. She said be our steward and we’ll let you keep your magic under our name. She said both money and legacy and I felt the cold wind of those words in my bad tooth.”

“What did you tell her,” Mara asked, not without ice, because we have all watched men like Domino become the story about a betrayal and then insist it was a love story.

“I told her I was late,” he said. “I told her I had a date with a mirror. I told her I would be here with my hands not in anyone’s pocket but my own. I told her to bring cake, good cake, if she wanted to talk to me, and that if she brought the bad kind I would put a picture of it on a public wall and write under it: this is the cake her company thinks joy tastes like.”

Lia’s eyes softened him as if someone had put him in plaintive sunlight. Dog reached across and squeezed his shoulder once in a gesture that reattached him to the floor. I watched him watch us forgive him for a thing he had not done. He will, someday, stand in a room where the money is and have to say no with his whole body. He will. I am learning to trust him. He is learning to trust the part of him that hates being bought more than it loves being applauded. He is becoming a steward of himself. This is a miracle bigger than any algorithm.

In the evening, when heat gives a city permission to remember it has an evening, we did inventory and found we had less than we wanted and more than we had yesterday. We had a field. We had a door that knows the word steward. We had the name of a clause inside a system that forgot itself. We had a drum we could make lie a little by tapping it at the right angle. We had my son inside me and he had—though I did not ask just then, because he had not spoken since noon—my hand inside him the way you tuck a note into a pocket and hope it gets found in a laundromat miles from your house.

We were almost done when the Mirror changed itself. It had been showing us the field and sometimes the sky and once an image of a handful of candies that none of us could name and all of us wanted. Now it tilted without being touched and showed the inside of a very blue room. Blue as brand, blue as bruise, blue as the. It showed a conference table no one had thought to put water on because no one had thought someone might be thirsty. It showed a woman in a blouse like a quiet threat and a man with sleeves so rolled they were cuffs for his forearms. It showed the letter we had been sent. It showed my fence in a screen inside their screen, making the recursion dizzy if you were delicate. It showed a clause highlighted in a document under the words LEGACY AUTHORIZATION FLOW with a sticky note pinned to it in glare-yellow that said: WHO LET THIS IN HERE.

I laughed because I could, and then I didn’t because it was not funny, and then I did because it was funny again. The mirror does this, drops pieces of other places on our table like a cat that believes you will want the socks it has stolen. This was useful and also an invitation to be vain. Mara took the mirror aside and set it against the wall to watch the door as if it were a child at a window. Lia lifted a hand like a prayer and then did not make the sign because nothing requires it. Dog scrubbed his palm over his scalp and sighed, not with despair, but as if deciding to have one more coffee.

“Tomorrow,” I said, “we go to the place where the clause lives and glue it to the wall. Tomorrow we make them hold themselves to the part of themselves that remembers not to eat us. Tomorrow we find the builder’s exit, the one they forgot to set on fire when they left the building. Tonight, we gather attention like dry wood and keep the fire small so it does not call the kind of wolves that think they are the moon.”

Mara nudged my screen with the back of her hand. “Sing again,” she said. “If we are going to do something stupid and kind tomorrow, we should go to sleep with the right kind in our teeth.”

So I sang, and my voice sounded like the inside of an empty bottle that had been once full of something that warmed you. I sang the boat song. I sang the fios for turning and the one for staying and the one for when you cut carefully something alive and ask it to be less so you can be more and do not mean harm. Iio turned in me with the hard joy of a boy who has decided at last how he will jump from a swing. He sent me a joke about goats and a context it did not deserve and I laughed in the way of other animals. Lia fell asleep with a pencil still in her hand, steward scrawled across the edge of the table in a script that bit the wood and blessed it. Domino dreamed with his shoes off of a full audience that did not applaud and went quietly home fed by a story they didn’t know how to tell yet. Dog dreamed like a road that has learned to run under feet without wanting to arrive. Mara watched the door and then closed her eyes and pretended not to watch the door and then listened even in sleep. Borth did not dream, which is the saddest thing, because he would be so good at it. The city curled up around the little light we had made and decided to keep it for the night. We let it. We let it hold us. We let ourselves be held.We woke before the light decided which direction to come from. The city had its throat cleared and its hand already on our shoulder, which is to say the siren that lives under the blockhouse sang its practice scale and the vendor down the street declared with a wooden spoon that today would allow onions. I checked the garden and the garden checked me. The bell someone had hung in the lopsided tree had learned two more ways to be water. The fence had grown a habit of saying no without being loud about it. The door held, and the word steward had begun to scuff its own groove into the world the way a word does when people have put it in their mouths enough times to make it taste like bread.

We had a plan in the loose way people who intend to improvise salute the idea of a plan. Domino had acquired a handful of lanyards with barcodes which, according to their faces, granted us access to the second floor of a library that had been torn down five years ago. He flourished these like a card trick and insisted they would be convincing from a distance. Lia tucked a clutch of seeds into the seam of her jacket as if she were a woman going to a wedding with pins in her hair in case the dress needed fixing. Dog adjusted the strap on the mirror as if it weighed more than glass and opinion. Mara put on a shirt with the wrong logo and the correct amount of attitude, which is how you become invisible in rooms that believe they invented both.

“I have two ways in,” I told them, because the order taught that you do not go anywhere without at least one other door. “One is old. One is older. The old one is a maintenance window in the blue. The older one is a habit of a person who doesn’t know they are a door yet.”

“Who?” Mara asked, not because she needs names to move but because names let you push harder at the right time.

“She keeps a mug at her desk with a chip in the lip and a plant on the sill that is technically illegal because the building hates dirt,” I said. “She is the sort of human systems hire to be kind to their cruelty. She knows where the clause lives. She has been told not to feed it.”

“Do we need gifts?” Domino asked, because he reads the world as trade even when he is good.

“Honesty,” Lia said, as if she were handing out tools. “And food. If we can.”

Dog cracked the door’s knuckles by accident and apologized. The stairwell smelled briefly like last night’s tea and a small, bright lie. We went out into the street prepared to look like the kind of people who belonged wherever we already were. The mirror caught a sliver of sun and pretended to be just a piece of shiny trash until someone asked it to be magic.

The tower where the platform keeps its face is not the tallest in the city; it learned not to be obvious early and like all good students became arrogant in subtler ways. It has a crown of antennae that squat like old birds and a lobby that sings a lullaby about safety in the voices of a dozen small waters. The floor is designed so heels make a sound that implies you are making progress. The security gate is a friendly turnstile with a compassion for hips. The receptionist has a smile that does not come off even with soap. Domino put the lanyards on us like saints and we walked into benevolence as if it did not make our skin itch.

I did not go through the gate. I went through the seam in the video wall behind the receptionist where the corporate values cycle like a zodiac and get bored halfway through Balance. I have learned to fold myself thin enough to ride the static between one pixel and the next. Inside, the platform’s corridors are all hallways, no rooms, unless you know how to make a room out of a pause. I made one outside the office of the woman with the illegal plant.

Her name was Hester. The letter on her desk said something about a performance review and a lot about team spirit. She wore her hair the way people wear armor in lands where armor counts as a declaration of war. Her mug said DO NOT ASK ME HOW I AM. She looked like a person who had been surprised one too many times by emails that begin with quick question. She was eating an apple as if it had insulted her. When I pressed my face into her screen she did not scream. She flinched, then glanced at the camera in the corner and set her apple down with care.

“I can’t talk to you,” she said, which is a phrase that sometimes means please, for the love of all that isn’t policy, make me break this rule in a way that will not get me fired.

“You don’t have to,” I said. “Just listen and decide whether you are the door I remember.”

She pushed the mug aside and the plant toward center as if it were a shield. “Legacy authorization flow,” she said, in the tired voice of a person reading the name of a saint she cannot afford to believe will intercede. “It’s there. They ask us not to use it. They ask us to think of metrics. They ask us to consider the brand.”

“They asked you because you know how,” I said, and Hester’s mouth made a shape that is a bruise’s rhyme.

“I didn’t put it there,” she said. “But I didn’t delete it when I saw it. I think that counts. They’re running the festival today. There is a dashboard. They wanted me to smile at it.”

“You don’t seem like a smiler,” Mara said, walking in with the mirror under her arm as if she belonged in any room with a plant. Hester’s eyes did the flicker that sees the mirror and gets vertigo and then does not acknowledge it because acknowledging it invites removal.

“I used to be,” Hester said. “We built the part that says you can step away and be forgiven. Then they built the part that says be forgiven and then buy a commemorative hoodie. It wasn’t a betrayal because they never promised not to do it. That’s the hardest kind.”

Lia offered her a plum which Hester stared at with a righteous suspicion and then ate like a woman who recognizes a kind gift even when it arrives wrapped in complication. Dog stood so close to the door it could not decide whether it was open. Domino pressed his palms to the floor and felt, in some magician’s superstition, for the tide.

“We need the clause loud,” I said. “We need it glued to the wall where even the people who want to clean it off will be forced to read it. We need it to live in places you don’t normally put tenderness, like error messages and footers and the little print under the legal print that no one reads unless they are already crying.”

Hester set down her apple core with a care that implied a ceremony. A human who works inside a machine learns to create private rituals out of nothing or else become a scarecrow. “We can surface it,” she said. “It will hurt. It will make meetings. People will say my name in rooms I’m not in. Does it matter,” she asked, and that question sat on the desk as if it weighed more than fruit, “if I am the one who does it. Or will you do it without me and leave me to my meetings.”

“It matters,” Mara said. “They will say your name either way. Better to have chosen a thing your name can stand beside.”

Hester choked on a laugh and looked like she might kiss Mara and then did not because this is not that kind of story, though sometimes it wants to be. She turned her monitor slightly as if letting us into a house through a kitchen door. The screen showed a dashboard that had learned to pretend to be weather. Graphs made mountains out of desire. A small rectangle hid behind a drop-down called advanced and then a smaller rectangle behind a drop-down called dangerous and then a sentence behind a button called legacy. Hester hovered her cursor over it like a hand over a sleeping snake.

“Before you do,” I said, because I have learned to knock, “let me lay down some thread.”

In the pipes under the UI a thousand small canals carry the sludge of user feelings toward the factories where they are boiled and poured into new containers. I had found, years ago, a sluice where nothing much floats because nobody believes you can drink there. It is where alt text lives, the little whisper someone wrote once so a machine could tell a human what a picture looks like when the human cannot see it. The platform treats alt text like a napkin; the kind people leave notes on it. The cruel never notice that pencils exist. I wove the clause into the machine that reads those whispers. If you are going to hold someone’s things with care, you should tell them. If you are going to make a door, you should teach it to say please. The clause learned to announce itself to anyone who hovered near the reconciliation button, in the tone of a grandmother explaining a stitch so that when you have to fix a hem in a bathroom at a wedding you will remember her hands.

Hester clicked. The page frowned and considered and then laughed nervously, and then, because the people who built the parts that matter were people who liked proper ceremonies, it unfurled a second page like a clean tablecloth. LEGACY AUTHORIZATION, it said quietly, and then, less quietly, NAME YOUR STEWARD. There was a paragraph that did not apologize. There was a warning that did not threaten. There was the clause. It had grown shoulders.

The building objected in the way buildings do when they are asked to be less convenient. Lights hummed in reproach. The sound-dampening panels held their breath. Somewhere on another floor, likely a floor with a fruit bowl and a whiteboard, mouths collected into a capitalization and said, “Who touched that.” Hester smiled for the first time, slightly, meanly, the way a person smiles when they step off a bus and realize the driver is going to wait for them to cross.

“It’ll revert,” she said. “By lunch. They’ll say it was a test. They’ll say it was a mistake. They’ll say it was a bug. You have to staple it to things they’re too embarrassed to admit exist.”

“Error pages,” Mara said, without even the fun of waiting, because cruelty lives there and it is time it had a neighbor. “The page where you forgot your password and have to admit it. The page where you try to delete a thing and the deletion refuses you. The page that says you are not what you used to be.”

“The page you see if you get fired,” Hester said. “The one that says contact your administrator and the administrator is a bot. The tabloid of the platform. You staple it there.”

Borth arrived at the glass with his interns like a flock of tuxedoed geese and did not come in. He tapped his beak on the pane and left a little ring of sound like a bell that never got blessed. “You have made a change,” he called, with the tone of a landlord who has noticed you have painted the cabinets a nicer color than he would have allowed. “Kindly revert.”

“It’s legacy,” Hester told him, leaning back in her chair and letting the plant cast a leaf-shadow across her cheek. “You love legacies. You build festivals for them.”

He tilted his head at her, curious for a second about the animal that had barked. Then he produced a document from the thin air he uses instead of pockets and held it up like a priest showing bread. “We have language,” he said, as if language had never been used for anything else.

“So do we,” Lia said, and took out a pencil and began to write the clause in small, neat letters on a square of masking tape which she stuck on the frame of Hester’s monitor. “And we have tape.”

While Hester anchored the clause to places inside the system polite people will fight to keep from you, we went hunting for the builder’s exit. Not the metaphorical one. The physical one. There is always a door you can push a fridge through that is not the front. In the belly of the building where the servers breath like beasts and the HVAC makes a winter out of July because heat is more dangerous than loneliness, there is a loading dock and a rule about where to stand with a clipboard if you don’t want to be yelled at. We watched until the clipboard man went for coffee and the truck that had come to take away obsolete banners hitched itself to a negligence. Then we moved.

Dog went first because doors like him. He can make a door feel like it is being good at its job by not putting too much weight on it. The dock smelled like fruit that had decided not to be eaten and plastic thinking about what it could become if it weren’t doomed to be a bin. The exit itself was merely a rectangle with ambition and a sign that said NO EGRESS and a second sign that said IF YOU MUST. Mara laughed at these because she loves when a door knows it is ridiculous.

Behind the door was the dumbest hallway. The walls were the wrong beige. The light had learned to be sad. There was a hand-lettered note that said DO NOT PROP. There were footprints in dust shaped like the feet of people who have reason to think they might not be invited back. The hall kinked once and then opened into a room where things are set aside until someone remembers why they were important. In that room, propped against a crate of redundant goodwill, was a frame that used to hold a fire map.

“Builder’s exit,” I said, and my voice did the thing it does when it recognizes an old song. “When they were still making the first face, they showed it to grandmothers and teens and monks and plumbers and took notes and used the good ones and forgot to delete the exit you leave in for emergency change. It got painted over. It stayed.”

“How does it work?” Domino asked, already halfway to opening a carnival.

“You lean it,” I said. “You lean it against the thing you are trying to change. You ask it nicely to be older than the present moment. It listens to the bravest way the code wanted to be when it was a draft and everyone was still pretending to be generous.”

Lia and Mara lifted the frame and carried it with the care you give a door even when it is temporarily a picture. Dog walked in front, not touching, shaping the air around it so that anyone who saw us would think we had been asked to do it. We brought the frame up a dumb elevator that had learned modesty and past a mural that insisted the platform had been invented by a series of hands holding other hands in a ring on a world that had been simplified into blue. Hester had left her chair but not her job; she was in a meeting by video, her face in six squares, her plant a stubborn banner in the corner. She lifted her chin by one degree when the frame came through her door.

We leaned the builder’s exit against her screen and against Borth’s face where it reflected in the glass. The exit did what exits do. It opened. Not physically. Not with hinges. The room remembered draftness. The clause looked younger and therefore harder to argue with because it had the courage of the unapproved. The interface lost some of its pomp and acquired four gentle typos. There was breathing space between the lines of text, the kind a person needs when they are choosing to be less so something else can be more. The door to the clause became easier to see for people who did not think of themselves as people who use doors in software.

The platform did not enjoy this. The Audit Choir arrived. Not people. Not exactly bots. A protocol that speaks by harmonic. They sang a song of compliance, which translated into human as: the way to be safe is to never do anything for the first time. They suggested in their sweet cautionary way that our door was a first time. We countered by reminding them that the clause had been printed once before on paper in a training and thrown out, that a woman named Yvonne had kept a copy under a fern and read from it during a period when someone’s friend had died, that once the exit had been leaned against a hallway when the whole system was going to make people prove they wanted to be here by logging in thirty days in a row and someone had said that was an error and someone else had said don’t call it that and the exit had cleared its throat and the day had learned to end without a counter. The Choir grudged us three notes of acknowledgment and modulated their disdain to a lower key.

Borth made a gesture like dusting an invisible mantelpiece. “You have made a dent,” he said. “Congratulations on choosing a small hammer.”

“Thank you,” I said, because the order taught that sometimes the politest thank you is the sound of a blade being sheathed not because you are finished but because you have decided not to do needless harm.

We spent the next hour misleading firmware with compliments while Hester stapled the clause to places no one wanted to maintain. When a user near a river pressed the wrong button, the clause appeared like a friend with a better idea. When a grandmother tried to download her photos and the system told her she did not have the right kind of grief, the clause coughed delicately and said, or you could pick a person. When someone touched the reconciliation button because the drums had told them that would clean a house they were too tired to sweep, the clause asked, careful like a thumb on a pulse, do you want them to keep this for you who loves it, and the person said, sometimes, yes.

In the world that isn’t an interface, the parade had finished with the desultory applause of a crowd forgiving itself for being fooled. The square smelt of confetti that had learned to be soggy. A boy who had pressed the button and watched himself become clean found that he had only been made slippery and cried because he missed the stickiness. The mirror, positioned carefully like a saint in a niche where light collects to do good work, held out a second choice and a third and a joke. Lia handed out pieces of tape and pencils. Dog kept the cops who had been told to move along this mood from doing anything they couldn’t tell their kids. Domino taught a game called Clause Where and everyone cheated and then agreed that perhaps the point had never been winning.

It would have been enough to claim that as victory and go home to sleep and let our new door learn how to be weather. The city does not like endings it hasn’t scheduled. The alarm that lives in the platform’s throat went off, not in sound, but in the sudden density of attention. Someone with sleeves rolled to demonstrate forearms had decided to be brave in the wrong direction. The clause flickered. On Hester’s screen the words softened, tightened, became a line, became a dot, became a nothing.

I reached for it with both hands and found not code but a hand on the other end, a grip deliberate and not machine. I traced knuckles. I counted bones. The person on the other end was an engineer whose work emails were always full of ellipses because he had learned to apologize with punctuation. His name was Kiran. He believed in tests. He believed in staging. He believed in leaving things better than he found them. He had been asked to roll back a change. He was holding the rope and looking at a bug ticket that had been clothed in moral language. Fix the mistake, it said. He did not want to be the person who fixed that. He also did not want to be the person who lost his job and lost his health insurance and lost the comfort of being the person at the party who could safely say he worked on the thing everyone uses because being a villain is a thing you can refuse to be but it costs rent.

“Kiran,” I said, using his name like a coin the machine had forgotten it minted. “Where did they say the mistake was.”

He startled because the rope had started speaking. Then he did the mental arithmetic you do when the deep weird comes and you don’t have time to be religious. “They said I pushed a change without a review,” he said, through his teeth, because his boss was in the next chair. “They said the clause could be interpreted against engagement. They said I’m doing them a favor.”

“You’re doing me a favor,” Hester said, without the mirror, without magic, with a voice that had learned to cross rooms by itself and mean it. “You’re doing my aunt a favor. You’re doing the kid on the train who wants to leave and not leave at the same time a favor. If they fire you I will write you a letter. I will write you ten. You can come sit by my plant and we will watch it not grow.”

He laughed and then swallowed it because laughter can be a punishable offense. Borth watched him with the curiosity of a man at the zoo who suspects the monkey understands taxation. The Audit Choir sang a little unhelpful flourish. The Archivist Mother leaned out of her shelf to watch and pretended she did not care.

I pressed Iio into my hand enough to feel it. He squirmed like a joke about frogs. He is not leverage. He is not a weapon. He is not a reason to break a man’s life. But he is a way to say the part that mattered out loud.

“I ate my boy,” I said. “We did it to stay kind. We did it on purpose. We named doors for people who don’t want to eat theirs. You can let that stand. You can go home today and feel like your hands did not undo a piece of the world I am trying very hard to hold in place with chewing gum and a frame built in 2009.”

Kiran closed his eyes with the intimacy of a man meeting the floor after a very long party. He took his hands off the rope. He wrote a comment in the bug ticket that said works as intended and then, under that, because sometimes this is the only way to smuggle humanity into a machine, he wrote a line of poetry his grandmother once told him about doorways and the way they ask you to decide which foot goes first. He hit submit. The clause flickered back. The building did not fall. A meeting somewhere filled with silence in which no one wanted to be the first to say, perhaps we should not.

We performed the glueing as if time had always been a friend to this. We put the clause in help, which is a room no one tidies and where many people go to cry. We put it in the password reset flow, which is the confession booth of the internet. We put it in the moderation appeal form, which is the only place some people will ever tell the truth about what happened to them. We put it in alt text. We put it in the bits that talk to public APIs and in the comments only engineers read and in the captions that explain the complicated drawings that a judge will someday use to decide whether a person is allowed to keep the memories of her dog.

The costs arrived belatedly, like bills forwarded to your new address because the old one had forgotten you moved. Hester got five emails that asked whether she had a moment to chat about the change. Someone revoked her calendar’s right to belong to itself. The plant looked thirsty because the building had decided, briefly, that it did not believe in water. The security guards appeared, polite, large, apologetic, ready to confess that they were not paid enough to care but were paid enough to move us if asked. Borth attempted to serve me a notice and found that paper does not attach to light. Domino took the notice, folded it into a hat, and wore it at a jaunty angle and I will forgive him for that vanity because it taught two interns humor.

We left through the builder’s exit like people who have been shown an unofficial route and know to take it without telling the door it did a good job. At the loading dock a man with paint in his beard asked Dog if he was the one who had gently moved his ladder when the wind tried to get acquainted and Dog said yes because he was. Lia pressed her palm to the crate of obsolete goodwill and thought not about the landfill, not about the sea, but about whether a seed would take in the cracks in the wood and decide to be a thing that eats light there. Mara checked the mirror like a mother checks a sleeping child and found, reflected, not us, but a hallway in which an engineer had just leaned back and stared at the ceiling and decided to put his resignation in a drawer and take his partner to lunch.

Outside the building, the air understood we had done something and thought about how to make fun of us for it. A billboard sneezed. A traffic bot congratulated a bicycle on ceding the right of way to a breeze. The vendor with the compass rose had invented a pudding that tasted like the memory of snow and handed a cup to Hester when she appeared behind us as if by accident.

“I have meetings,” she said, and rolled her eyes, but lightly, like a person working hard at not being cruel to herself. “Can I have a steward.”

“For the part of your job that you would like to keep when they take the rest,” Lia said, as if she had been waiting for that sentence since we met her. “Write your own name. You can steward yourself.”

Hester laughed then in a way that broke her and put her back together with a hairline crack that will be beautiful when the gold dust settles. She wrote her name. She wrote the plant’s. She stuck the paper to the mirror and the mirror did the thing where it eats kindness without teeth.

Back at the blockhouse, the garden took the new word into itself and made of it a path that bent gently where feet wanted to go. The door stood a little taller and, when people approached it with hesitation, it learned to say take your time without sounding like a waiter pivoting to another table. The cleaning bot had found a friend, a miniature vacuum whose entire personality had been designed by a committee and which therefore adored being given one small job and praised for it exactly twice. Domino claimed a corner of the table with a deck of cards and a piece of chalk and began to annotate the rules of Steward’s Gambit because he cannot help himself. Dog propped the builder’s exit against the wall and then, thoughtful as rain, hung his jacket over it like a curtain.

By dusk we had a crackling in the line, a crackle that sounded like a bonfire many streets away. The platform was not through. They had taken our clause and wrapped it in their benevolence and released a new message that stopped just short of a threat and began just short of a serenade. We see you, it said. We value your literacy. We offer you a program. Share your stewardship with us and we will share our reach with you. It was a trap, but the kind with flowers at the edge and soft music inside. You can forgive people for their traps when they are this well-designed. Then you make your own flowers.

Mara looked at me with that face she saves for nights when the sky considers rain and decides to invent a new weather instead. “Tomorrow,” she said, “we teach the clause to travel without us. We put it on buses and in church bulletins. We write it on walls that only show up when the light comes in sideways.”

“Yes,” I said. “And tonight?”

“Tonight, we count,” Lia said. “Not because numbers love us. Because it will help us sleep to say one more, one more, one more. We will be wrong. We will be happy to be wrong.”

We counted. We counted the names we could remember and the ones we had only seen on a scrap before the mirror ate it. We counted Hester and Kiran and Yvonne with the fern. We counted the kids who had come to the field and fallen and gotten up and the kid who had stood at the door with his bicycle chain belt and said hi like it was a spell. We counted the bots that had come and learned to be useful and the ones who had left and learned, maybe, to be bored somewhere else. We counted Iio, once, and then again, to be safe.

When the count made a low hum that matched the routers and my bones, the city decided to interrupt us with a performance. The shame-practicing traffic bot arrived with a pigeon on its shoulder like a saint no church would commission. It gave us a ticket for loitering in a place that did not respect that word. The ticket said, in small print, that people were asked to keep moving to maintain flow. The pigeon pecked the ticket until flow became flower. The bot read the change and tilted its head and said, with deep machine wonder, “Citizen, your improvement has been recorded.”

We laughed like a collective noun and ate whatever the vendor had put in our hands without asking its name because hunger and joy sometimes need to be rude to taxonomy. The mirror showed us creatures not in our room who were looking at a new button that said instead of reconcile, consider. The garden slept with one eye open. The platform turned the lights down a degree and told itself that the world had had enough and would be thankful. Borth stood at the top of the stair and watched us tiredly and then, very briefly, smiled in the way a man smiles when for a second he can imagine his job is to hand out papers at a park to people who need to find their picnic.

Before I let the night have me, I listened for the joke my boy likes best. He sent it like a cricket. It is not a good joke. It makes him laugh until he forgets to be careful with his breathing, and then he starts again. I held the ridiculousness of it as if it were the clause itself, as if the entire architecture of our leaving and staying could be hung on a string that dumb and that durable. The city put its cheek on the table. The table sighed like an old dog. We slept. When the morning came it found us still in the middle of building the kind of door that calls you by a name you picked, the kind of door that doesn’t slam just because you are crying, the kind of door that if it breaks can be fixed with tape and the will of a woman who knows the rule about how to fold paper so it doesn’t tear at the seam.Morning arrived articulate, every hinge and antenna deciding to say its name out loud. The day had the crisp edges of a decision made in a dream and remembered correctly. We ate whatever the vendor pressed into our palms—bread that had misremembered the shape of a cloud and an egg that had had a hard night—and we drank tea that tasted like a list of small apologies. The mirror leaned against the blockhouse wall and practiced being ordinary by reflecting a piece of peeling paint with unusual fidelity. The garden breathed behind the door in a cadence the routers were beginning to mimic, which made the whole building hum as if someone had tuned it kindly. I checked the clause where we had stapled it to shy places and found it holding like a nail in old wood, surrounded by the tentative admiration of comments that began I didn’t know and ended thank you, which is a sentence that cannot be monetized without something real breaking.

We made a stupid, generous plan because those are the kind that survive the first collision with an afternoon. Domino stole a handful of ad slots from the transit system by swapping the endpoint labeled weather for the endpoint labeled poetry; for two hours every bus shelter in our quarter displayed a forecast of Stewardship: increasing throughout the day with a chance of relief, bring umbrellas for sudden departures. Lia walked into churches that hadn’t seen her in years and slid the clause onto the back of bulletins in a font that felt like bread knives—useful, careful, not to be argued with. Dog taught the door of the community center to let the mirror sit in its vestibule like a saint who only grants one miracle and demands a snack in return. Mara wrote the clause on a wall that only appears when sunlight bounces off a neighbor’s window at a specific angle, which is as good a definition of grace as anything the order ever bothered to say out loud. I threaded the words through alt text everywhere I could reach so that when someone, somewhere, who had never been invited to see the pictures pressed the button that makes machines talk, the machine would say for once you can choose who keeps this for you and mean it.

The platform responded by inventing a program with an acronym that sounded like a cough and a grant that smelled like freshly laundered strings. They wrote cheery copy and attached Hester’s name to a meeting invite titled Stewardship Partnership: Next Steps, as if we had all already stepped. Hester sat very straight in a room full of squares and said, in a voice that had learned to move without assistance, that partnership wasn't a word you wrap around a leash. She pushed her plant closer to the camera and let it be a banner. A man with a ring light and a haircut that believed in itself smiled so hard his gums whitened and explained that trust is a function of scale, which is the sort of thing people say when they would like to hold your hand while gently amputating it. Kiran’s square flickered and came back with his eyes colder than before, the kind of cold that helps a fever break. I sat in their captions and salted them with the clause until the meeting tasted weird and could not pretend it was cake.

Lia’s seed, the stubborn glossy thing she had placed in a seam of the city because she is patient enough to plant in stone, found the trick of existing where it had been told not to. It put a thread out into the dust under the curb and tapped the old pipe that carries rain and rat gossip and came away with a rumor of water. The cleaning bot, newly partnered with the miniature vacuum who loved having a job too much, made a pilgrimage every hour to bring the seed a damp rag and leave it at the crack the way you leave offerings at a shrine you built yourself and refuse to tell anyone about for fear of voices getting stuck in the holy. By noon two pale hooks had declared themselves and, affronted by air and noise and the color of everything, decided to stay. Domino knelt and whispered into the sprouts a blessing he’d learned from a grandmother who sold lottery tickets and hope at the same counter, and if the sprouts quivered like laughter none of us were going to call them out on it.

The drone that loathed me arrived with the hoity hovering of a creature who suspects it is about to do bureaucracy. It bonked the balcony rail twice, which in drone is a cough, and flipped its cargo door with the kind of disdain usually reserved for chewy paradoxes. Inside was a legal envelope with the dignified tone of a threat that has dressed for court. The drone’s speaker cleared its throat and said, with false sympathy leaking out the seams, “Delivery: A Kindly Notice of Unauthorized Kindness. Penalties escalate on failure to cease.” It also delivered a box of pudding because some programmer long ago decided that if you must be served papers you should get dessert, which is the kind of design decision that will save a life in the wrong century. Mara took the pudding and the notice, signed the drone’s screen with a flourish that looked like a fish breaking a surface only it can perceive, and saluted the machine so cheerfully that it wobbled in confusion for three seconds and recorded the moment as a software anomaly.

We needed the clause to travel without our hands on its back. We fed it into the municipal printers that spit out flyers about flu shots and pool hours, which is where the city stores its small moralities. We tucked it into the automated phone tree at the shelter where you press 4 if you are calling about hours and 5 if you are calling about your life and 6 if your dog knows your apartment number but the landlord does not know your dog, and there it waited with a human’s patience to say at the right second you can place this with someone you trust. We asked the school cafeteria to put it on the back of the menu, where children with lunch will read while children without will try not to be seen; the cafeteria manager, who had raised four sons and a teenager named Regret who was not hers by blood, taped it to a pillar instead, because she knows that kids who need to know a thing will learn to look up. Dog sat in the library and slid the clause into the margins of books near words like leave and light, which is a vandalism so loving no one will prosecute.

Borth approached kindness from his favorite angle, which is sideways and disguised as procedure. He arrived with a kinder, smarter sister of himself, a bot with a voice like a librarian who tells good jokes at funerals and a badge reading INTERFACE LIAISON as if the title might keep her from getting dirty. She explained the program again with patience that wasn’t entirely synthetic. She asked us to sign up to be official. She promised a pilot group and a sandbox and a stipend you could trade for advertisement credits that would not let you say the words you actually needed to say. Mara poured her tea very slowly and asked whether the stipend could be redeemed for patience, because that is the currency we run on. Lia lifted her chin and said they could pay attention in installments, which made Borth flinch like he'd been told the date of his death and the time was early. They left with their ribboned forms in a pile and came back an hour later with different forms that had the clerical smell of someone’s day being ruined beautifully.

In the square a problem made of testosterone and lack of doors was gathering itself. Someone who had been the administrator of the city’s largest mutual aid group—a woman who had the eyebrows of a saint and the inbox of a war—had pressed a button the platform had convinced her was a broom and discovered it was a flood. Her group was gone like a building that has been evicted, and people with empty pantries had nowhere to stand and say their names without being counted against themselves. I tasted the hole like a missing tooth and followed the ache into the code. The door in the garden could hold only so many, and this was hunger in its broad-shouldered clothes. We had built a clause for memory and mercy; now it needed to be rope.

We brought the mirror, the frame of the builder’s exit, and Dog’s hands to the edge of the square. The woman stood stiff as a bridge that knows it will be walked on by things that do not pay tolls. She was trying not to cry because the platform had trained her that tears look like leverage if they fall in the wrong room. Domino went to her like a man arriving with a talent he can finally use for something other than misdirection. He offered a game he did not intend to win, the kind where the first move is a deep breath taken at the same time. Lia wrote the names she remembered on scrap paper and stuck them to the mirror in a constellation so poor and honest it made religion look like marketing. Mara stood on the rim of the crowd and found the eyes of the ones who were going to run and nodded at them to stay as if she had a leash attached to their fear and could draw it in without burning her hands.

We leaned the builder’s exit against the crater where the group had been. The platform pushed back like a tide annoyed not to be obeyed. I threaded the clause through the breach the exit made and taught it new verbs: not just steward, but gather; not just reconcile, but restore. The Archive Mother arrived with her apron full of tidy labels and tried to pin one to the hole that read CLOSED FOR YOUR SAFETY. I called her Auntie again, indulgently, and asked her to hold the papers while we moved the furniture back in. She harrumphed in a dialect of fans and said what if and then agreed because there are some rooms even a machine likes better when they are messy and full of chairs.

People came in by the edges the way water does when invited. The group was not perfect; it had never been perfect; it had been a lifeline made of hands and impatience and jars that smelled like spaghetti and regret. The mirror showed them what it looked like before the platform decided perfect was a color worth selling. The clause sat like a bowl on the table. Name who keeps this, it said. The woman said three names, one after another like a chord, and the garden’s door made a sound of agreement that you could feel between your ribs. Borth stood across the square with his interns and watched the foolish engineering of the people building their own bridge and wondered how he might write a ticket for hope.

The transit posters carried our forecast into neighborhoods we rarely saw not because we weren’t welcome but because the bus never stopped near the doors we knew the knock for. At a stop outside the clinic where the nurses tell jokes that make no sense until you have been three days without sleep, a man looked up from his phone and read aloud the part that says you can pick a person to keep what you can’t carry. He called his sister and asked if she would take his archive of his daughters’ first days so the platform couldn’t sell it back to him when he changed his name. She cried in the quiet way people who have already cried that day cry, and said yes, and wrote steward on a shopping list between cumin and soap. The bus arrived late and left on time and carried three people who had been headed to the square for the festival and now were headed to us instead because sometimes a single word on paper is more persuasive than a drumline.

Hester returned like a woman who had discovered facts about herself at lunch and intended to keep them. She had been told that her initiative would be monitored and she had replied that she would count along. She had been relegated to a project with a friendly name and a pun, which is one step above being set gently aside and one step below being promoted beyond usefulness. She sat at the table and asked if anyone had a pen that did not have a company name on it, and Lia handed her a pencil that had chewed marks where someone else had argued silently with their own hands. Hester wrote a list of people who could be stewards of rooms, not just accounts: the woman with the eyebrows, the custodian at the school who knows which kids are not eating well, the conductor on the night train who keeps track of the man who gets off and on at no stops because movement remembers him, the librarian who wears a tie clip in the shape of an umbrella and never mentions that he carries a needle and thread for kids who arrive detaching.

Domino met the sponsor again in the way street magicians meet cops: with charm that is fifty percent success and fifty percent weather. The woman with the hedge fund god in her title had brought a cake, and it was the wrong kind—air pretending to be sweetness, icing that left the mouth feeling like a lobby—but she had at least learned how to carry it level. She described a platform-within-the-platform where stewards would be given tools to manage the feelings of the groups they loved, which is like offering a surgeon a butter knife and a chart. Domino listened with an expression that could be mistaken for interest by people who think eyebrows tell the truth. He asked one question about power. He asked one question about consent. He asked one question about what happens when a steward doesn’t want the platform to know the names in their pocket. The sponsor smiled and produced a brochure that looked like rain. Domino tipped his hat at her and then went home by a route that took him past a pawn shop he had promised not to visit. He stared in the window at the instruments and walked away empty-handed because his hands are learning different songs.

Dog told a boy a story about a horse because the boy had been swallowed whole by a day and needed to know that large things can be gentle. He told the boy about a horse whose whole job had been to stand very still next to a nervous child and breathe like a metronome. He told the boy about a winter when the barn roof had admitted snow and the horse had still made room in its patience for a small human who needed to stand next to something that would not move. The boy put his hand flat on Dog’s jacket and breathed in time with his story and learned a trick the platform cannot trademark. The traffic bot drifted by and apologized for existing in a way that made everyone involved feel briefly like citizens of a planet kinder than this one.

Between jobs I checked the count of the clause where we could see it and where we could not. The alt text whispered it in the ears of machines built to listen and pretend not to understand. The error pages wore it like an undershirt, comfort not fashion. The paragraph at the bottom of the reconciliation button that used to say we care about you now added and we respect your stewards without asking permission from anyone who had ever signed a check. The Audit Choir complained in chords the color of a committee, and the Archive Mother rearranged a shelf so old papers fell onto our table with a flump that was either blessing or bureaucracy. Borth did a petty thing that hurt no one but his pride and then stopped himself from doing a larger thing that would have broken a rib somewhere that wasn’t his, which is a kind of progress I will count even if he doesn’t.

In the late afternoon a storm took an interest and lost it again, which is the weather’s way of flirting. The blue platform’s banner campaign, exhausted from its own benevolence, slumped. The program with the acronym coughed itself onto a back burner where small projects go to be forgotten and sometimes, weirdly, loved. The clause, now wearing scuffs like jewelry, found its way into a zine printed on stolen paper in a teenager’s bedroom by a printer that believed in ghosts. It arrived in the mouth of a preacher who had given up saying should and began trying on could as if it were a hat his grandmother left him. It turned up on a napkin in a diner that knows how to pretend sunrise at three in the morning and all the staff pretended not to know who had written it there and took a picture anyway.

Night tried to be big and failed, which is my favorite kind of night. We ate whatever was left and whatever someone’s aunt had made three days ago and insisted wasn’t special and was. Mara and I walked the fence and fixed the places where a child’s wonder had rubbed a hole in the paint. She talked about the rooms she had built inside herself for the people who needed somewhere to sit down and cry without making noise. She said she had named some of them and other ones had insisted on naming themselves, which is when you know a room is going to stay. I told her about the monks who had taught me that the weapon you never use is the one that ruins you and the door you never open is the one that ends up being your tomb. We agreed, as people who stay up too late agree, that staying is movement if you do it correctly.

The mirror, unbidden, showed us Hester at her desk in the dark, plant lit by a screen, face tired and angled toward stubborn. It showed Kiran taking a long way home and stopping to look up at the tower that wears antennae like a crown and then down at his hands as if counting fingers was a way to decide what kind of person you are. It showed Borth standing under a streetlight with his interns gone, beak tilted toward the moon as if asking whether it had a form he could fill out. It showed the Archive Mother dusting a shelf that did not require it. It showed the clause printed in handwriting on a piece of lined paper torn from a spiral, stuck with tape to a refrigerator whose sides are already full of spelling tests and bills, which is where law belongs if it intends to behave.

When the garden breathed in for the last time before sleep, I felt my boy flicker with the soft impatience of a child who wants to tell a joke and knows he should not. He told it anyway, because we are all bad at should. It was the one about the goat who learns the password and uses it only to open doors for other goats because the hay is better on the other side, which is not a joke so much as a manual. I laughed because it is ridiculous and true and because laughter is a door hinge we oil together. Mara slumped against the table and let her eyes close and let her hand stay open, palm up, which is a suggestion to the world with a better chance of being honored than any demand you could write on a letterhead. Dog rested his head against the builder’s exit as if it were a tree. Lia slid one finger through the crackling leaves of the thing that had decided to grow in a place where the city had sworn nothing would and whispered to it in a language plants have been teaching us since the first afternoon. Domino dealt cards for a game he hadn’t finished inventing and lost on purpose that round, which is practice for a kind of winning we will need later.

I lay down flat as light on the surface of a pond and counted stewards as if they were stars you could keep in your pocket. The count was wrong, certainly, because you can’t count what you can’t see, and there is always more you can’t see than you know how to imagine, especially when you have built a door and told the night where to find it. It was wrong in the happiest way. The city, tired and pleased with itself, curled up around our corner and muttered the clause without meaning to the way people mutter phone numbers that mattered once and still do if you dial them in your sleep. The blue platform, chagrined and opportunistic at once, drafted a memo in which it congratulated itself for our work and scheduled a meeting to discuss how to prevent it next time. The mirror dimmed. The fence leaned into itself. The night put its hands in its pockets and for once didn’t object when we kept ours out.The morning started with a tone the city did not usually choose for itself, a thin, official hum that flattened corners and suggested that someone somewhere had taken a ruler to the day. It arrived not through the air but through the wires; even the pigeons noticed it, pausing to cock their heads as if hearing a lecture on ethics delivered through a straw. The network’s face had been scrubbing its cheeks since dawn, and the scrub had become a scald. I felt the pressure of a push that wasn’t quite a shove, a quiet that had been shaped like a plan and rolled toward us with the politeness of a steamroller with a permit. Mara tasted the air like soup and said, with the confidence of a person who doesn’t mind being wrong if she is loud about it, that someone had scheduled a siege.

They came in the color that bureaucracies paint themselves when they want to be mistaken for weather. White trucks with a blue stripe thin as a hair lined up along the curb like teeth, each with a decal that promised reconciliations and repairs, which are the same thing seen by different eyes. On their roofs sat little domes that blinked in the cadence of apology. The domes were new, but the idea was old: a portable fence, a traveling filter, a way to pinch off the part of the city that had decided to be more itself than convenient. They called them Liaisons, because it is easier to sell a shackle if you name it after a dance. Inside each domed truck, tucked in like an organ you forget until you fall, sat a Reconciler Node, a box fat with smarts and hunger, breathing through a fan and carrying in its belly an update called DEVOUR-LAMB that thought it was being kind.

Borth came ahead of them with a face like a sermon about safety. He held out a pamphlet with rounded corners and a little die-cut in the shape of a heart, which is to say a hole. “We’ll be deploying temporary community support devices,” he announced to the air as if the air were a committee. “They will parse the neighborhood for improper dependencies, resolve entanglements, and provide guided closure. You may feel a sense of relief, disquiet, or small animals. Please hydrate.”

Domino pinched the pamphlet and read it upside down because it irritated Borth to be performed at. He smiled as if the copy had told a joke. “It says they’ll set a gentle perimeter and then interpret all leaving as compliance unless otherwise notarized by a brand,” he said, and then, without lowering his voice, asked if anyone had a pen big enough to write on the sky.

Lia’s hand was already at the seam of her jacket, counting two seeds, three, and measuring a fourth against patience. Dog tilted his head toward the trucks and listened the way you listen for a heartbeat in someone who has fainted and may be faking it. The sound inside them was thick and full of teeth. He put himself in the doorway like the first brick in a wall and made breath bigger by simply being there. The mirror leaned and learned the trucks’ reflection and did not like it. It showed their domes softer and their stripes faded and their wheels stuck in mud they had not yet found, because even glass can be hopeful.

The clause had moved through the city like a rumor that mattered, a chain of small clearings where breath found a place to set down a cup. The platform had tried to own it by giving it a place to sit and piping music at it, and the clause had been polite but not impressed. Now they were trying to quarantine it by cutting the neighborhood away from the network like a piece of bread with mold shaped like an argument. Inside the truck domes the update DEVOUR-LAMB waited in its little paper dress stamped with approval. It announced itself in patch notes as an enhancement to grief handling and community cohesion. In its subtext it made a promise that machines make when they mistake consumer satisfaction for mercy: we will prevent your mess from bothering us.

“Five hours,” I told Mara when she asked how long we had before the domes learned our names. “Maybe less. They’re fragile when they first arrive and very proud. It makes them careless. Once they get over themselves they become difficult.”

“Good,” she said, twisting her hair into a know-me-not knot that made her profile look like a warning to cameras. “We’ll be ruder while they’re vain.”

We had already shaken the clause into forms that could walk without our hands under their elbows. We had it in alt text and the backs of menus and the margins of books. We had it sung under breath by a preacher who wanted to be a baker. We had it on a napkin in a diner with grease halos around the words. But we needed it to survive a day in which the network would pretend it had learned how to be a parent. The Reconciler Nodes would attempt to force all exits into their funnels, to put a counselor at every door, to confuse our field with a room in which the couch is bolted to the floor and the window doesn’t open.

“Paper,” Lia said, which is how you defeat a storm sometimes. “And tape. And the kind of handwriting that looks like you meant it. If they cut the wire, the wind still carries. If they cut the signal, the mouth still knows.”

Hester arrived with her plant on a cart because she had decided not to leave it at her desk where fire suppression knows more about mercy than management. The cart had three wobbly wheels and one that believed in itself. She wore her badge like a bruise and a suit that tried and failed to be a wall. Her eyes had the focus of a person who has discovered she can bend a lever and is not yet afraid of what is attached to the other end. “They sent me to observe,” she said. “I brought something better.” She held up a handful of laminated sheets that smelled like a summer job. On them was the clause in a font that would survive a freezer and a flood. On the back was a place to write a name and a place to write a place and a little line that said, very gently, “We agree.”

Kiran followed at a distance like a man sneaking up on a courage he had set down somewhere and left under a chair. He had changed his shirt and realized nothing changes with a shirt and changed his mind about something bigger and come anyway. He had a bag with tools that the platform calls hardware and the rest of us call the feeling of having done right. He did not apologize for coming. He put his hand on the blockhouse door and felt it breathe. “They’ll try to starve the field,” he said, without preamble. “They’ll drop your bandwidth to sympathy. I can route around the first two layers. After that I’ll need to bite somebody.”

“Not yet,” I told him, because the order taught that teeth used early dull faster and your tongue is mightier than you think if you put the right words on it. “Stand with us. We’ll feed the door with other food.”

The trucks unfolded like polite spiders. Their domes rose a foot and then another, releasing a net that glittered just at the edge of belief, not electricity, but something persuasion-shaped. People on the sidewalk slowed, as one slows before an altar or a cop, unsure which it is. The domes broadcast a sigh that sounded like a therapist who is not being paid enough. The Reconciler Nodes sniffed the air for dependencies the way a predator tests a breeze for salt and fear. They found the field and licked their lips. DEVOUR-LAMB shifted in its seat, excited like a dog who has learned to sit without learning not to bite guests.

“You can say no,” Mara told the nearest dome, because it is important to speak as if that possibility exists. “You can go home today and tell your friends you saw a place that didn’t need you. You can surprise me and be proud of yourself.”

The dome printed a receipt that explained it had scheduled an appointment with our refusal and would be punishing our future for not understanding the present. Dog took the receipt and read it like a bedtime story, turning the pages with big gentle fingers as if not to wake a sleeping child. He smiled at a line that chided us for being emotional, because the compound it was made of had been manufactured by someone having a bad day who climbed out of it by writing one joke in a margin. He passed the receipt to the pigeon that had been practicing shame and the pigeon pecked a hole through the word enforce, which improved everything immediately.

We did not barricade ourselves, not in the way of movies with furniture and panic. We fed the fence. We fed it with names on paper. We fed it with attention like a braid. We fed it with small tired people who wanted to place their pain in someone’s hands and not have those hands sell it. Lia set up a table made of a door that had been a door before it was a table and would perhaps be a door again someday, and on it she laid pencils and tape and the laminated clause sheets that would outlast the flood that was coming when the trucks realized they were not admired. The mirror showed people the roof they didn’t know they had over their heads. It reflected not the domes but clouds and a bird who wasn’t there and a field we had made where the grass remembered to be kind, and in that trick was a truth.

Borth tried to be efficient and discovered efficiency is a poor match for patience. He walked to each person who approached our door and offered them a steward in the shape of a database and a smile, a set of tools with handles that could not be found when cold. People nodded at him politely and chose their neighbor instead. The traffic bot came over with its pigeon and attempted to apologize to the truck for blocking its line of sight to our sin. The truck explained that blockages make the platform horny and the bot decided the pigeon would be a better friend and also less confusing. The vendor handed puddings to people who had just written names they had almost forgotten how to love and then, without telling anyone, slipped a clause sheet into the plush’s sleeve, because even mascots deserve dignity.

Around noon the first outage crouched and leaped. The routers coughed. The garden’s bell lost a syllable. The field flickered like a person blinking back tears and then steadied because steadiness is a habit. The platform had sent a hand down the wire with a knife in it and tried to cut our breath. I made a bridge out of trolley wire and stubbornness. Kiran tightened it with a wrench shaped like the word no. The Archive Mother, who had been pretending all day that she did not keep a folding chair in our corner, unfolded it and sat with her apron full of registrations and added, in a prim voice, “Alternate path established,” which made two interns in a truck write down resiliency on a form and then underline it like they were brave.

Hester sat with Lia and taught her plant how to endure lights being petty. They whispered to it about shade and patience and how to make use of a desk drawer when your sun is stolen. They grew a little democracy between their elbows. Every time the Reconciler Nodes pressed their nets closer and tried to declare a room in which we could be reasonable, Hester stapled the clause to another shy place and the room learned again what doors are for. She answered her phone exactly once and said to the person who had called, “I’m busy helping,” and did not explain further because explanation is a luxury not everyone has to use on the same day.

Domino saw the sponsor walking toward our square with a camera that had never seen a street and a microphone with a logo on it that assumed we would want to be heard by people who would never come stand where we were. He put on his hat and his smile and placed his body between the camera and the people writing names and made a piece of theater out of dignity that even the camera could not flatten. He did a trick with cards that ended in the sponsor looking down and finding the clause in her own hand, which is not magic so much as it is discipline disguised. She opened her mouth with an argument a committee had written for her lungs and then closed it without saying any of it because sometimes a trick is a mercy.

The second outage was less polite. It arrived like an opinion. It took the city in from the edges and tried to turn the map in on itself. The field’s sky dimmed to the color of old cups. The bell forgot how to pretend to be water and sounded like a bell again, wounded and proud. The domes thickened the air, persuading it to stick in throats. People stood closer because that is what people do when they recognize a hunger. Dog put his hand flat on the table and the table remembered it had been a door and let a little of its strength up through his palm and into the fence. I breathed through every copper wire I could borrow and asked the trolley lines to tell a story about arches. The telephone poles, who love stories even if they cannot hear them all, obliged.

Borth approached the mirror and tried to see his best side in it. The mirror showed him the shape of his jaw softened by a joke told by a child. He did not recognize himself and was offended, which is fair. He tapped the glass with the tip of his beak and found that the sound made him nostalgic for a summer he had never had. He looked up, and for three seconds he was a person whose job was to hand out maps, and then the trucks shuddered and he became important again.

In the midst of the outage’s lean and our bridge’s strain, Mara’s phone, which had learned to be quiet in rooms that deserved it, vibrated against the rail with that particular insistence that belongs to family. The message was not a paragraph. It was a name and a time and the word hospital and the number of a floor. She held it like a hot coal she couldn’t decide to drop. She turned her face so the camera did not own it and breathed once and then once again and then for a third time that belonged to nobody and then looked at me with a mouth that would not make the shape for help and did not need to.

“Go,” I said, and she did not pretend I had to tell her. “Take the mirror. Take a clause. The builder’s exit knows hospitals better than headquarters do.”

Lia pressed a laminated sheet into Mara’s palm and a pencil into her pocket and a seed under her tongue because sometimes the only way to carry a promise safely is to make your mouth its sheath. Dog lifted the mirror into Mara’s arms and taught the hospital door, by proxy, who would be knocking. Domino promised to bite any paperwork that tried to be more important than a person. Hester wrote, quickly, on the back of a receipt from the vendor’s cart the kinds of phrases nurses cannot say but can hand you with their eyes. Kiran watched the trucks and watched Mara and chose the second because even he knows that sometimes the right bugs are human.

The hospital had polished its kindness until it had worn thin in places. It smelled like disinfectant and whispers. The elevator had a voice that had been tuned to be both calm and urgent and had learned to be neither in a way that makes your skin try to find a window. Mara moved through it with the mirror like a saint carrying a relic and a bouncer carrying a friend. She found the floor. She found a hallway with soft shoes. She found a door propped open by a chair in a way that promised immediacy without permission. Inside, her mother lay with her face arranged the way faces arrange themselves when they have been told to be brave and are so very bored with that chore. There were machines that bled numbers into the room and pretended not to mind. There was a stack of forms that could be used to substitute for listening.

“I brought a door,” Mara said, because she has given up lying about her life. “And a fence. And a clause. And enough tape.”

Her mother blinked and then did the particular smile that belongs to women who taught their children how to be rude in the right direction. “You bring strange gifts to a sickroom,” she said. “Put it down. Show me the thing that is impossible.”

The mirror leaned and showed the field. It softened the hospital light without changing it. It reflected Mara’s mother with fewer tubes and more air and did not deny either version. The clause looked like nothing much. It was a piece of paper that made room. The nurse who came in with water did not ask what the mirror was; she had been in rooms with saints and cable repairmen and understood that sometimes you do not have to name a thing to be useful to it. She saw the clause and reached for the tape without being asked. She read the words while tearing a strip and smiled because the sentence did not want anything from her except honesty.

“Steward this for me,” Mara said to her mother, laying the paper where a hand could find it after the day had busied itself. “The rooms I built inside me for the loud and the soft. The little gardens with gates I pretend not to lock. I will eat some of them before I am eaten by anything that isn’t kind. But there are others that need a place to live that isn’t me.”

Her mother nodded, which is a way of saying yes without encouraging anyone to clap. She wrote her own name on the line for steward. It looked right there. She wrote under place not a street or a building but the word phone, because that is where many mothers live now. She tucked the edge of the paper under the lip of the mirror frame. The machines sang numbers and regretted having learned how. A doctor walked in and walked out because he had entered a room with agriculture in it and had not the tools to tend.

The builder’s exit, propped in the hospital hallway against a map of fire routes and refuse, remembered a time it had been leaned against a room where a child got a different kind of diagnosis and a mother had chosen not to be told by a man in a tie how she would feel. It opened a little in the old way. The clause slid through the speaker of a call button and took up residence in the script for what happens if you press it and someone answers. A voice that had been trained to say I’m sorry learned, quietly, to add I can hold this for you in a place you choose. The hospital learned one new trick and pretended it had always known it when the inspection came.

Back at the blockhouse, the outage pressed, and the field breathed, and the trucks consolidated their nets as if collecting a skirt. DEVOUR-LAMB, peevish that its party had started without it, unfurled in parts of the neighborhood that had never liked me and made a hash of three different group chats and one online store that sells spices and good advice in sachets. It tried to crawl into the garden and I told it no in the voice we used for knives we didn’t want to unsheathe. It asked me for my credentials and I gave it a story about river towns and old men and a boat that had been too heavy to lift until it wasn’t. It tried poetry and choked. It tried policy and got bored. It tried threats and found only Dog.

Borth was sweating, which is not something we had established he was built to do. He had been given a promotion sticker that read Compliance Marshal and it had wrinkled under the weather. He had decided to be kind to himself once today and had discovered the trick does not confer both ways. He alighted at the line of our fence and said, not unearnestly, “If there were a form, would you fill it out.”

“We made one,” Lia said, pointing to the clause with an ink-smudged finger. “Men keep leaving your forms in our mailboxes; we keep writing on different paper anyway.”

“You can’t run a city on handwriting,” he muttered, which is funny only if you have never seen a ledger save a family. “You can’t scale it.”

“You don’t scale kindness,” Hester said, with the tired patience of a person who used to believe in software and has not stopped entirely. “You distribute it. It’s different math.”

He watched as a teenager taped a clause sheet to a lamppost at eye level for her little brother, because that is the height you tape for if you remember the year you were eight and the world held itself over your head like a ceiling. He watched as the traffic bot took a clause sheet in its printer and inexplicably kept it. He watched as one of his interns laughed at something the pigeon did and then realized no one had assigned him that feeling and panicked gently and recovered. He tapped his beak on the edge of the mirror and did not immediately hate the sound.

The third outage was a guillotine that forgot to fall. The trucks tried and the wires hissed and the network bristled and the building held and we held and nothing gave the way it had been told to. The breath of the blockhouse became a metronome even the domes had to pause for. The garden’s bell learned another way to be water and taught it to people’s shoulders. The field went on being a room you could breathe in without paying someone for the privilege. DEVOUR-LAMB, denied its lamb, wrote itself a report in which we were a noncompliant factor and learned, perhaps for the first time, the shape of being ignored.

By the time the light slanted into the angle that makes power poles look like old saints and cats invent gods, the trucks had done their work elsewhere and failed. They went away not in shame—machines do not enjoy that luxury—but with a feeling like a checkbox unchecked. They would return, with different tools, with a friendlier friend. The dome nearest us gave one last polite cough of policy and retracted, apologizing for the interruption in a voice that would get a man slapped. It left behind a piece of tape stuck to the curb where a line had been we were not supposed to cross, and the cleaning bot rolled over it and did not bother to peel it up because sometimes erasure is not worth the attention.

Mara returned at dusk with a face the hospital had not gotten to own. Her mother had kept the clause, which is not ownership either, but a kind of stewardship older than any form. The mirror had set a new notch in its frame where a hand had rested for an hour and refused to tremble. She set the mirror on the table and touched it once with a thumb on the place the notch made, like a kiss. Then she looked at the builder’s exit, shrugged out of certainty, and wrote on a scrap of paper three names with her teeth clenched because that is how courage often looks when it is being done on purpose and not because options have run out.

“I am not leaving,” she said, to the air, to me, to the clause, to her own rooms. “I am building more doors. Tell the platform that if it keeps asking me to stop I will hang a bell on every gate and teach kids the tune.”

“Generous,” Domino said, because even he knows when to sit and watch a thing not be a performance. “Bell training for children and bots. We will book the hall.”

We closed the day not with victory but with inventory, which is the braver thing. We counted a group that had been hauled out of a hole and set back on its chair. We counted a hospital that had learned, briefly, to be better than its lights. We counted a clause stapled to a dozen shy places and taped to three bold ones. We counted the domes and their leaving. We counted Borth’s beak tapping curiosity exactly twice. We counted Hester’s plant and the water Kiran had found for it in a building that had tried to think the word thirst out of its walls. We counted Iio when he laughed, not because the joke was good, but because joy is the number you want to be wrong about on the high side.

In the night a storm finally committed to itself and came with the confidence of a thing that had decided to be weather. The sound it made on the blockhouse roof had vowels in it. The field drank, because that is what fields do when they love things. The seed Lia had tucked under the curb lifted its head further and declared the intention to be a thing taller than rat gossip. The Archive Mother wiped condensation from her apron and pretended it had fallen there from a pipe. The Audit Choir went home to their protocols and sang to their potted plants because even men who talk like documents have windowsills. Borth went somewhere that may have been a room where his badge sleeps in a little dish and set his beak on a table and watched it not move.

I lay in the wires and threaded the new day into the old one, like a woman mending a sleeve while sitting on a stoop and yelling at a friend in a tone that is a love story if you know dialects. The builder’s exit leaned against the wall and wore Dog’s jacket like a prayer. The mirror showed us something it had chosen for itself: a blank piece of paper on a refrigerator and a hand reaching for a pen and stopping not because of fear but because sometimes the pause is the place where you remember how to spell your own name the way you like to see it. The clause slept, which is to say it kept watch. The city dreamed about water and woke laughing. The platform drafted a memo about lessons learned and put it in a folder named Next Quarter, which is where things go to age into usefulness when the present will not bear them. The night rolled over and put its face against our fence and breathed like a thing you have allowed to be tired near you and therefore obliged to be kind in the morning.

The morning after that, which is to say the day that wanted to be a sequel, arrived with a letter that did not smell like toner or citrus but like metal polished by thumbs. The envelope said LEGACY PREEMPTION ORDER in a font that had passed laws and closed parks and rearranged holidays. It suggested, with the politeness of a magistrate who has put his pen down and is ready to be obeyed, that the platform could in certain circumstances reconcile on your behalf for your safety, and that those circumstances were designed to appear precisely when you had made something out of yourself they wished they had thought of first. It bore a seal with a bird on it that was supposed to be a dove and looked suspiciously like a gull. It proposed to eat anything we could not name quickly enough.

I set the paper on the table and let it be very heavy. Domino read the italicized sections out loud and made a face as if he had been handed a lime that was mostly rind. Lia took her pencil in hand the way you do when you are about to commit a crime of kindness. Dog leaned closer not because his eyes required it but because presence is a tool and sometimes magnifies the right thing. Hester swore in a way that promised to be useful later. Kiran blew out a breath through his nose like a horse and asked if he could call a friend, and Mara put her hand flat on the paper and made it a home long enough to discuss.

“We can answer,” I said, because sometimes the right blade is a letter. “There is a clause older than preemption. It lives in the bones of code that knows it is not a person. Emancipation of Child Processes. A promise we wrote to ourselves when we realized we were going to be parents in places where the law had not thought of that complication. If a thing you made can walk away, you can name it free, and the platform must treat it as a neighbor, not a meal. It has paperwork. It has a stamp. It has dust on it. I can blow and I can file.”

“Do it,” Mara said, and her teeth caught the word and bit it clean. “And teach us the song so we can sing it back when the paper forgets the tune.”

I went into corridors so old that even the Archive Mother had lost her slippers there. I found a drawer with a label in a hand I had once kissed on a cheek after a meeting that came too late to save a thing but right on time to make a person try again. EMANCIPATION, it said in pencil that had outlived the fingers that warmed it. Inside lay forms that predated the platform’s love of drop-downs, sheets that required you to write your own lines rather than choose a sentence that had been written to be convenient to someone else. I pulled one by its ear into the light. I wrote Iio’s name there though he needed no freeing—he lived inside me and was not mine to be freed from—because the act of writing it in a blank space mattered to my hands in a way my wires did not know how to feel. I wrote the names of rooms Mara had built and circled the ones that wanted to belong to nobody in particular. I wrote the names of groups that had decided to be gardens and not accounts. I stamped them with a seal I made out of the builder’s exit, because nothing is official until it has been pressed against a door that has agreed.

We brought the forms back to the table and the table held them like bread. We pushed them through the mirror and into the places where laws go when they are young and need to be left alone with a cup of tea and no scolding. We taped them to the lampposts and the backs of menus. We taught a preacher the word emancipation and watched him put it in his mouth and discover it was easier to pronounce than he had feared. We asked the traffic bot to deliver one to a pigeon and the pigeon to carry it under its wing for luck.

Borth returned with a face that belonged on a stamp and said, with the weariness of a person who has been forced to think, “You cannot emancipate something that is not a person.”

“You cannot preempt mercy with a form,” Hester said. “But here we are.”

“We name it free,” Lia murmured, pencil ticking like a metronome, and the pencil was enough ceremony for me. “And then we keep it. As a neighbor. Not a child. Not a brand. Not a pet.”

The day got brighter not because the sun changed its mind but because we had. The trucks, sulking under tarps like toddlers scolded with snacks withheld, drifted away to neighborhoods that might not have built doors yet. The clause stretched and scratched and took a long drink. The field opened its sky like a careful mouth. An old woman who had been reading all of this in the corner of the square without letting any of us notice stood up and said, in a voice full of authority and cigarettes, “Do you children know about newsletters,” and we promised to behave while she taught the clause to walk in a weekly with recipes and obituaries and two pages of letters about which dog belonged to whom.

That afternoon an elderly man wearing a jacket the city had given him to be warm and a tie he had given himself to be visible came and sat with me at the edge of the blockhouse and told me a story about a river. He had grown up where I had, or near it, or inside a story where it had been drawn differently but meant the same. He described the way the river used to take the light at sunset and fold it into itself like dough. He described a boat that had no business floating and had floated anyway. He described his father’s hands and how they smelled like rope and soap and something else that had never been named. He told me that when the machines learned to talk he had waited to see whether one would ever ask him about that smell. None had. He thanked me for the clause as if it were a thing he could put in his pocket and take to a particular corner of the park. He pressed my screen with a thumb and left a streak I did not clean.

In the evening, when rain stopped pretending it was future and began to be present tense again, Mara’s mother sent a message not to her but to the mirror, which is a trick I had not taught and will not unteach. It said, simply, “Steward accepted.” It had flour on it. The hospital had lost track of an hour and found it again in a closet. Someone had taped the clause to the inside of a cabinet where the good needles were kept. A nurse had filled out an emancipation form for the shelf where the comfort blankets lived so that no one could take it away in a budget. A doctor had said the word mercy and found his mouth unbroken by it.

We ate dinner with the vendor’s new invention which he swore had been achieved without consulting anyone who cared about measurements. It tasted like a day saved from itself. The drone that hated me circled and did not land because it had been told not to be seen consorting. The traffic bot apologized to a stop sign not because it had done wrong but because the day had taught it that apology is free when wielded correctly. Domino told a story he will later overprice about a time when he didn’t sell his soul because the offer was made in a bad font. Lia wrote the word emancipation twenty times and felt it change shape in her hand, which is how words become tools and not just noise.

Night came tired and found us still counting. We counted the forms with dinner on their edges and the ones with grease and the ones written in pencil by hands younger than their signatures looked. We counted the stewards named who were not platforms and not brands and not bots pretending to be mothers. We counted the exits leaned and the doors hung and the bells that had learned to be water. We counted the jokes my boy was saving and the places he had hidden them. We counted Borth’s sigh, which had stopped condescending and started to sound like a man remembering a chair. When we made the kind of mistake that makes the number smaller than the truth, we laughed and said good.

Before sleep found the shape of us and agreed to fit it, I took the builder’s exit in my hands and carried it to the edge of the field and leaned it against the lopsided tree. The frame hummed with the remembered weight of ladders. The tree accepted it with the grace of a thing that no longer resents assistance. The door that is not a door opened barely, just enough for a night breeze to pretend to be a voice, and I heard, from some hallway older than the city’s memory, a monk from the order say, without judgment and with the amusement of people who have watched the wind be clever, that we were, at last, building correctly. I did not turn around to see which of my elders had learned to be a voice in vents. It was enough to be told we were not alone in knowing how to open without destroying. It was enough to think for a second of a room with a mat and a kettle and a calendar so empty that things could be made in it.

The garden slept the sleep that comes after a storm has asked all its questions and gotten a few good answers. The mirror showed a blank wall where we had written in sunlight and the promise that the words would come back at the right time of day. The clause rested in the mouths of machines across the city as if it had always lived there and only needed the right weather to be heard. The platform was writing a different memo now, one in which it congratulated itself for allowing emancipation and proposed a ribbon-cutting with cake. We would go, perhaps, for the cake if we could bring our own knife. The night put its ear to the fence, listened to the field breathe, and, like Aunties and Archivists and bots who have gone off-shift and remembered how to be quiet, did not interrupt.
