The morning the river steamed like a kettle left too long, Keith set up his mic by the bridge and sang to the pigeons and the first brave espresso-sipping dog walkers. The Spokane River humped and hissed under the ironwork, all froth, all urgency, chewing the daylight as if it were bread. The Colossal Clock said six-fifteen. The air held a cold that made your ribs careful. He liked that, the way cold tempered a voice and kept it from slouching.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he told his empty hat. “Welcome to the day.”

His sound was unamplified at first. He cleared his throat, rolled his shoulders, pressed a palm into his own diaphragm like a farmer testing a cantaloupe. Then he began with a waltz no one remembered. A thing of his own, stitch-worked from all the old songs his grandmother had sung in a kitchen window overlooking lilacs and a rusty trampoline.

And I’ll go down to the river wide,
where stones talk back and the cedars hide,
and if you ask me what I know,
I know the way the waters go—

A bus hissed across the Monroe Street Bridge. The spatter of tires. The city exhaling a gray breath.

He switched to something people might give quarters for, and his voice grew wire and smoke. A Tom Waits cover, then a swelling “Shenandoah” because the river had demanded it. It always did in the mornings, grumpy and old, an auntie passing out breakfast gossip. Three joggers passed him, two smiled. One girl in a mustard woolen hat stopped, listened a moment, then turned to the side to pretend to tie her shoe — he had grown used to that quiet trick of listening without being caught.

The first quarter of sun shouldered over the hill line and leaned on the clock tower. The red brick held it like a saucer.

“Okay,” he said. He tucked his guitar tight against his jacket. “Now for the throat murder.”

He tried a high run their last lesson had left dangling over his conscience, and two notes in he heard her voice in his ear, not stern but absolute: Drop your shoulders, Keith. No lifting with the traps. Belly. Back. You sound like a scarecrow trying to fly.

He laughed aloud at the memory of her sarcasm and flubbed the note extravagantly on purpose, turning the mistake into a bluesy slide and a grin. He was a singer from Spokane. Which was not an apology. It was an address. It meant pine needles stuck in sneakers, brick alleys with miraculous roses growing out of broken mortar, big agricultural skies, shy cold water that could still drown you if you disrespected it.

The mustard hat girl came back and placed a folded five like a prayer into his guitar case, then said, “You sound like smoke. In a good way.”

“Better than sounding like kitchen grease,” he said, and bit his lower lip after; his jokes always outran their charm by one syllable.

She shook her head, laughing. “I work nights at Luna. Grease is the taste of work that’s been done.”

“I’ll write that down.” He wanted to say, I will turn your sentence into a chorus, but didn’t. She left, and the river threw spray up as if it approved of everything in the world before nine a.m.

When his fingers finally stung he put the guitar away and plucked three dollars and change from the case and stuffed it into the breast pocket of his denim jacket, where a small rip had given everything a place to escape. He had a lesson in forty minutes. He could have canceled, the way he always told himself he could skip breathing for a day and see, just out of curiosity, what happened. Instead he walked the ten blocks to the studio, keeping his hands in his pockets because the air bit and because he loved to feel the quarters like little planets migrating towards his ribs.

Her studio was above a bakery whose cinnamon roll scent could make even the devout betray themselves. A narrow stairwell with a banister smooth as river stones led you to a door with frosted glass and gold paint naming all the artists nested inside. Pottery. Shea Studio. Pilates. Maren Ashbee, Voice. The font used for her name had a curve that promised subtlety. His father — not one to be impressed by fonts — would have said it looked expensive. His father would have said it while pretending not to be proud that his son had work that wasn’t a job at the paper mill.

He palmed his quarters and rapped knuckles against her door and heard her call, “Come on in, dear,” in a low alto that warmed everything. The room was the same every time. A rag rug she’d rescued from a church sale. An upright piano with a picture taped inside the lid: a laughing child with milk on her face. A wall crowded with framed show posters — Seattle, New Orleans, Reykjavik of all places. A palm plant putting its leaves into the conversation. Everything faintly warmed by a little electric radiator in the corner that had to be bribed by tapping it with your foot.

Maren was sitting cross-legged on a stool, flipping through sheet music, a pencil in her mouth like a pirate with a knife. She wore a sweater the color of the inside of an avocado, and over her right wrist a narrow bracelet no man would notice unless he was meant to. Keith, of course, noticed things for a living.

“You brought the cold in with you,” she said, laughing, surprised as always that the weather could pass through a frame of wood and glass and into a person.

“Sorry.” He held up his hands. “I’ll leave it by the piano. It can listen in.”

“Good.” She tapped the bench. “Sit down. Breathe.” She wore her hair up in a knot so haphazard it came to a decision all its own and remained stable only by stubbornness. Strands broke free and made parentheses around her face.

He sat. He spilled his quarters into the dish by the door, a habit from his first lesson when he was so broke he’d paid in coins and she had said, “Money’s money,” with no sign of condescension, and then they’d sunk into vowel sounds like sinking into dry sand at the river beach, digging until the cool showed itself. He told himself he liked her as he might like any teacher who made him better. He kept telling himself this until the words moved around his mouth without meaning. He had known her three months.

“We’re going back to square one, but like, a nice square,” she said, dropping her pencil. “Your high notes are popping like corn. It’s charming. It’s not good.”

“I feel personally attacked.”

“You pay me to attack you in the gentlest way. Breath. Again.”

They both inhaled. The window fogged.

He adored the way she critiqued. The way she could be blunt — No apology inside your throat, please — and funny — Imagine the note is a ferry and you are not allowed off until you arrive — and how she looked right at the thing that was wrong and didn’t flinch, the way she must look at herself in the mirror and refuse to let any lie live there, even the sweet ones. She was older than him. A decade. Maybe more. He didn’t know from numbers that way. He knew from textures. If she were a day, she’d be weather right after a storm, everything rinsed and sharp. She had a faint line at one side of her mouth that only showed when she smiled with her whole face. He wanted to know what story had put it there.

They worked. He sang scales that felt like tying knots with his throat and they unknotted them together. She put her hand flat against her own belly and he put his against his chest, then corrected, then found it, that place where breath was a lake and not a startled deer.

“There,” she said. “Keep that.” The praise was quiet and temporary, and he loved it. It was not an award, just a small map piece. He could slip it into his pocket.

“Have you ever had altitude sickness?” he asked when they paused to drink water and pretend to look out the window.

“Yes,” she said. “On a roof in Reykjavik. Does that count?”

“I don’t think Reykjavik even has altitude.”

“My fever did. How’s the band?”

“They’re still called The Larches because Téo won’t let me vote otherwise.” He ran a finger along the piano keys, not pressing, just flirting. “We got a slot at Baby Bar again. Friday.”

Her eyebrows acknowledged it as good news. She had expressive eyebrows. “I’ll try to come if I can get a baby-sitter.”

“You have a—? Oh.” He gestured toward the photograph inside the piano, the milk-faced girl. “That’s your daughter.”

“That’s what the evidence suggests.” A smile with that line deepening. “She’s a menace. Singing already. Off-key like a revolutionary.”

He tried to bury whatever impulse had sprung up then, as if the foolish part of him had thought that picture was of some previous self, of a sister, of anyone not as singular as a child. The warmth he felt rearranged itself, became a good feeling with edges. People brought their whole lives into rooms. It was unreasonable to act surprised.

They returned to vowels. To an aria he could not say the name of without swallowing a mouthful of pretension. He squeaked and she barked a laugh and he did not mind because she liked the attempt more than a safe prevention.

Between exercises, when they both sat back and she rubbed the heel of her palm against her sternum as if there were some music tangles living there, he said, “Did you have a gig in Reykjavik?”

“On a cruise. Tall ship in summer. It was one of those tall ships that pretend they are pirates for the children at noon and then at midnight they take on people with shiny shoes and pretend they are moonlight incarnate.” She tilted her head. “We did Sondheim in the mizzle and sea shanties when the thunderheads mouthed at each other, yes. I had a contract that ran on for months. I learned to sleep in a narrow bed and not mind it. And I learned—” She paused. She does this sometimes, he thought. Leaves a pocket in the sentence for air. “I learned to drink my coffee before the wave could take it.”

“You sailed.” He leaned a little towards her. He could picture it too cleanly: a deck, a railing under his palms, ropes that knew more than he did about tension, a dark water that wanted to be your friend and would let you drown all the same because that’s not its job.

“I have sailed,” she said.

He wanted to ask, Will you sail again? Only because he wanted to know when the shape of his days would be cut differently; not because he was planning to take his heart and move it somewhere unwise. He was not planning that. He was not. “Do you ever miss it?” he said, which was safer.

“Every time the sky is the wrong kind of gray. Which is mean to say in a city this far from salt. Your river helps. Sometimes I stand on the bridge and pretend the flies on the water are jellyfish. It’s not effective.”

“You should see it in spring,” he said.

“I keep thinking I should.” There was something like decision in the way she said keep. As if the thought were already a frame she stepped into and out of.

They trailed off into humming. He tried an old English folk song that had no place among Puccini but liked the room best and refused to be ejected from the playlist. She listened and then broke into a harmony so simple it felt invented for the first time. The thread of it knotted to his ribcage. He gripped the edge of the bench under the piano. He told himself his hands were there because the bench was narrow.

“Again,” she said when it ended. But they did not. They sat and let the last ghost of the chord go.

On his way out, at the door, he turned back, which he almost never did, because he disliked being that kind of person — the lingerer, the look-backer. “You ever read about river charms?” he asked, which was not what he had meant to ask.

Her laugh lifted into the ceiling. “What do you mean?”

“My grandma had this story,” he said. “About a ring they pulled out of the river during a flood year. Like, a ring that had been worn by a woman who ran a steamboat line back when. The way she told it, the ring kept finding people who were in a mess and needed out. Like it would turn up in the mud, in the root of a willow, wherever and whenever, and whoever picked it up somehow got what they needed. Or maybe it just made them brave enough to walk toward it. I don’t know. I only remembered because you said the river helps.”

“I like that,” she said. “Am I supposed to ask what would you ask of the river ring if you had it?”

“No,” he said too fast. “No. I was just… it’s just a thing she says.” He swallowed. “She said that ring belonged to somebody called Elsie Norwood. Who swore in Swedish, apparently, even though her last name sounds like a lumber company.”

“Elsie who swore in Swedish.” Maren shook her head, amused. “We should invite her to class. A steamboat ring. I’ll think about that. Next time we sing about water, let’s make it watch us.”

When he left the studio the cinnamon smell had thickened into something that made him doubt all his beliefs about self-control. He told himself to go home. Instead he ducked into the bakery and bought a clumsy apple turnover that leaked heat into his hands through the paper and left crystallized sugar like distant snow on his jacket, and then he took his hunger and the way it woke up other hungers and kept walking.

He went to the record store to talk with Dani, who worked there as if the shop were a temple and she its smallest, kindest priest. She held his apple turnover while he flipped through a bin of used folk vinyl. She made a face at the stickiness. He grinned. “I like it when you look like a cat smelling the sewer,” he said.

“Rude,” she said. “We got a call about your gig. Someone named Ms. Wednesday? She wants you to play a porch party in Browne’s Addition. You can only say yes to that if you bring me back a bottle of something with a label that uses the words ‘orchard’ and ‘untamed’ in combination.”

“I’ll bring you a whole orchard,” he said. The bell over the door chimed. He looked up and saw no one he knew, which felt like a relief. Spokane is small enough that you always see someone you knew when you still had a different haircut. He liked occupying windows of time where he could be an unspecific person.

They argued about set lists until his phone vibrated and he had to go. Téo had a van that needed pushing. He roasted his hands on the hood. They got the engine to cough. The Larches practiced in a garage that had a calendar for a shutter. His voice, warmed by Maren’s demands, held strong. The band worked nine songs and left three broken on the floor like dropped plates.

That night, alone in his apartment, he sat on the carpet and strummed very quietly on the guitar that had been his until it was more than his. He let his index finger find that E minor shape and tried to sing like it was a confession whispered into wood. He stopped twice to swallow, as if he were onstage and the audience had become a field of corn swallowing him right back.

He’d had teachers. He’d had crushes. He was not a fool. He’d avoid the place where his chest got tight when Maren laughed and said his name. He’d keep that feeling as a lake you walk around, admiring the water and the way it holds sky, without stepping into it at night where it gets deep and the temperature drops so suddenly your bones forget their names.

He didn’t sleep well. He dreamed he was walking in the river with a ring hooked on his finger and it pulled him downstream, gently, like a governor on an engine telling the day it could not run itself to death.

His grandmother called the next morning. “I dreamed of you,” she said by way of hello. “And you were singing to a big fish.”

“It’s what I do,” he said, amused. “I entertain salmon. I stand downstream of Post Falls and I convince them to throw the game.”

“Don’t tease your grandmother,” she said. “It frightens the fairies.” She had a voice like newsprint — rough, ink-stained, full of letters. “Have you cleaned beneath your bed? Have you introduced yourself to your neighbors? Do you eat vegetables shaped like trees?”

“Yes to two of those,” he said. “What did I sing to the fish?”

“Something like a prayer,” she said. “But made of rope. Did you ever look for that ring?”

He paused, one hand on the kettle handle, the other on his day. “What ring?”

She scoffed to punish him for disrespecting a story. “Don’t bait me. Elsie Norwood’s river ring. I saw it in a window once, I swear it. In a shop that used to be a barber shop and then was a shop that sold pipes to boys who wanted to pretend to be old. The window was filthy. The ring was in a dish with bottle caps and pennies that thought they were unlucky. I felt it look at me. But I had no money then. Or if I did I had an idea that money had it in for me, which amounts to the same thing. Go look in Browne’s Addition. There are things there that remember we used to be a different town.”

“I’ll go look for your fairytale,” he said.

“Do,” she ordered. “Wear a scarf. Don’t let your desire get ahead of your sense. Though if it does, bring it back stories.”

He tried to take that advice like a vitamin and failed to swallow it whole. He went to the porch party and sang for women whose eyes were the color of the dry side of an olive. He played Baby Bar and did the harmony thing wrong twice and thought of Maren’s eyebrows and did it better the third time. He took a walk in Browne’s Addition because he was already there and the houses were all turned out like ladies in winter dresses, tight and extravagant, waiting for the dance to start. The maples blazed. It was October — a jacket month, a brave month, a month where lost things make themselves findable.

The shop was not a pipe shop. It sold— everything. Old postcards with handwriting that threatened to tell secrets and then didn’t. Record sleeves without records. A photograph of a woman in a sailor suit scowling as if someone had told her she looked fine and she refused to forgive them for lying. A glass bowl with mismatched teacups. A drawer of keys. He slipped into the air like slipping into an old coat. A bell went off above the door, different from all other bells. It had an accent.

“Hey,” he said to the man behind the counter, who was also the man under the counter, as his legs were crossing and uncrossing there. “You got any rings that looked like they were left on the bottom of the river for a few decades?”

The man, thin with a beard so neat it looked like someone else’s work, said, “Everything in here looks like that,” straight-faced. “What do you want it for? Marriage? A curse? Bar trick?”

“Blessing,” Keith said, which shocked him; it was not in his vocabulary. “Or at least a very gentle curse with an easy return policy.”

The man nodded as if he sold those every day. “In the back,” he said. “Left. Third case. Or the red bowl by the lamp with the woman’s face on it that looks like she knows you. She doesn’t, of course. But she looks like it.”

Keith went left. There were rings that were only rings, their metal asleep. There were rings that had been made from spoons and remembered soup. There were rings that looked like thumb-knuckles. He almost walked straight past the red bowl because the lamp truly did seem to be quietly judging him, and he did not like to be judged by a lampshade. He reached in. His fingers found bottle caps that had flirted with magnets, bottle caps that had lost interest in being themselves. A twisty tie. A safety pin. A thin metal circle that might once have belonged to someone's bicycle bell. And then — a coolness he recognized because he had dreamed it. Not magic. That would be too undomesticated a word. But something like a weight saying, I am. He pulled it up. The ring was simple. Silver maybe, if silver had been held in a palm and kissed into remembering. There was an engraving inside. Careless letters with purpose. E.N., said the tiny inscription. Or could be E.H. if the light angled itself wrongly. He liked that it required him to cooperate to be legible.

“How much?” he asked, because that was what one asked, because you had to put a price on things before you could tell if you were going to take yourself seriously.

“Twenty-eight,” said the man, not looking up from the book he was reading about birds, which may or may not have been a book. “Or two twenties and I give you five back and you owe me a secret next time you’re in. Your choice.”

Keith made himself laugh because otherwise he’d get something sentimental and unmarketable in his eyes. He paid. He put the ring on his index finger because it was not the kind of ring that wanted the showiness of being a ring on a ring finger. It felt wrong. He tried his middle finger. Too big. His thumb. It sat there as if to say, We’re not committing yet, we’re just seeing.

Outside the shop the day had the taste of pennies again, that metallic cold. Leaves did their numbers. His phone hummed. It was a message from Maren: Remind me to show you a breath exercise with a book on your belly. Also: I put your name in for a winter gig at the Fox lobby. If you say no, I’ll pretend you didn’t.

He looked at the ring and said to it, which is the kind of thing you only admit to later: I don’t know what I’m doing.

The ring said nothing. Good. The river had more to say. He walked the long route home just to cross the pedestrian bridges that split river from river. A heron stood on a rock like a claim staked in a ledger. He wanted to shout to it and ask what it knew about returning to the same place every day and pretending to be surprised by it so the day would behave.

He dreamed again that night. He did not remember the details, only that he woke with a line in his mouth he’d never heard before and had to write it down before it burned away. He recorded a voice memo in the dark, the dull voice of the half-woken saying, “the water doesn’t forgive, it forgets, that’s different,” and then went under again like a man who simply loves sleeping.

On Wednesday, Ms. Wednesday herself made him tea in a kitchen tiled in green like a forest costume. She said, “Your voice makes me think of traveling with a broken suitcase,” and he said, “You should write my press kit,” and she said, “I only write for the trees,” and he did not argue. He sang to a living room of twelve people and felt completely seen by a fat pug at the foot of an armchair. When he finished, a man with a thin ponytail cried silently and heavily into his own fists, and Keith loved him for it without needing to know why.

Maren came to Baby Bar after all, a quick turn at the door and then she was in the back, near the pinball machine, in a coat that she did not take off even as she smiled, even as she cheered. He knew she was there without seeing her — some part of his body raised its head like a deer. He sang a song that had a sea in it because most songs did if you looked closely. He did not look at her as he sang. He did not, and that required muscle. When the set ended she was at his elbow and she said, “You did not chew the high notes. You’ve stopped chewing. You let them be food.”

“I had a good teacher today,” he said, and immediately hated himself, loved himself. Both.

She looked at him, friendly and distant, the way you look at a student who is also a person. The way you look at someone whose hands you would fix on a piano and whose hair you would not touch. “Do you have five minutes?” she asked.

“I can have five,” he said, and went where she led, down into the hallway that smelled like bands had been born and died there, opened at the end to a loading dock that let the cool night into his blood.

“I have to tell you something,” she said.

He nodded because yes, obviously, the ring was cold on his thumb and his throat understood this moment before he did.

“I have to go away for a while,” she said. “A contract. They asked me to come back. Not the Reykjavik ship. Another. Pacific this time, leaving out of Seattle. It’s— it’s money. And it’s time. And if I turn it down, I won’t get the offer again, not like this. Six months. Maybe seven. If you want, I can set you up with another teacher. I hate to do this to you. I know you’ve just. You’ve started to sound like yourself. It’s terrible timing, which tells me it’s the right time. That always happens.”

He had prepared for this without knowing it, the way your body learns to lean when you live with wind. He breathed. He should say congratulations. He should say, you’ll sing to jellyfish again. He should say, send a picture of the horizon sometimes so I remember it exists. He said, because his mouth was both wiser and more dangerous than he liked to credit, “I’ll miss you.”

She looked at him then, not teacher to student. She looked at him like anyone looks at another person when what is true has elbowed a space in the room and refuses to be moved by manners. She closed her eyes once, briefly, as if testing their strength. “We’ll keep things tidy,” she said. Then she shifted, still facing him but differently in her stance. “You’ve got six weeks until I leave. Let’s work like thieves.”

He laughed too loudly, and it bounced off the cinderblock and returned to him diminished. “Okay,” he said, and discovered it was the only okay he could do.

They emerged to a night so clear you could inventory it. The sign above the bar flickered once like a wink and then steadied. He went home and sat on the kitchen floor. He put the ring on the table with reverence and zero belief. He looked at it. It did not glow. It did not whisper. It was a thing made by people, for people, that had survived the indignity of the river and the boredom of being in a bowl with pennies. He reached across the table and put his forefinger through the circle, then slid it to his thumb and spun it, idly, until the E.N. inside felt warm to touch.

“I don’t know how to do this tidy,” he told the ring, which was talking to himself, which was fine when no one else could hear. “But I will try.”

He slept badly. He dreamed about the sea again, and it wasn’t a sea, it was the river in a coat too big for it, and he was trying to button it up, and laughing, and then he was not laughing because the buttons were all eyes.

He woke to the sound of a train. The morning smelled like a decision. He got up, put the ring in his pocket, put his voice in his body as best he could. He caught himself on the way out the door, looked back, and said to his apartment, to be kind to it because it had not asked for any of this, “I’ll be back,” and the room made a sound like a page turning when there’s no wind.

He met Téo under the tall mural that made the side of a building into a saint who wasn’t a saint but was the woman who had run the lunch counter there for forty years. Téo said, “You look like you stole something.”

“I did,” said Keith. “I stole a decision from the future.”

“I hate when you talk lyric,” said Téo. “How many new songs did your decision write for you?”

“Three and a half that I’ll deny,” he said. “Did you know you can sing with your ribs?”

“I sing with my elbows,” Téo said, and they loaded the van with so much ceremony it felt deliberately unceremonious. That is to say: ordinary life continued.

In the quiet between everything that week — between eggs scrambled and rent paid and the band arguing about whose turn it was to coil the cables properly — he went to his grandmother’s. Her name was Alma. Her backyard was a knit of shadow and peony stems that had forgotten what to do with themselves now the flowers were gone. Inside, she had the heat turned up to an ancestral level. The kitchen table held a thousand rings of gatherings past, a palimpsest of tea cups and coffee mugs that, if read properly, would tell the town’s entire history in stains.

“You found it,” she said at once, peering at his hand. “Or something that rhymes with it.”

“It’s probably a spoon handle someone hammered into a circle in 1958,” he said.

“Excellent,” she said. “Those are nearly always magic. Come here. Let me see.”

He took it off, placed it in her palm. Her hands were the color of flour. She read the inscription aloud in a whisper. “E.N.”

“Elsie Norwood,” he said, because even if it wasn’t true, he wanted to test what it felt like to say the name into air that had listened longer than his had.

“Elsie never married,” Alma said, as if they had met for coffee this very morning. “Oh, she had three men brought to emptiness by her laugh. And one woman who moved away to teach in a village in Idaho when the village didn’t need teaching and the woman didn’t want a man, not in the way men expected. But Elsie married water. And the boat drove its share of cattle upriver and its share of fools down. I’d say the ring came through fire, too, by the look of it. You got business at sea, baby?”

“I don’t,” he said. Then, unprepared: “She does.”

Alma nodded slowly, as if he had made a noise in a language she remembered from a trip long ago and was translating it back into her kitchen’s dialect. “Tell the ring what you want. Then tell it what you’ll offer in exchange.”

“That’s buying and selling,” he said. “That’s not a charm. That’s capitalism.”

“You hush. You say what you’ll offer that isn’t a thing money knows how to count. We’re made of bargains, you know that. You tell it you’ll behave. You tell it you’ll learn how to. You tell it you’ll look at the water without lying about what you see.”

He turned the ring over in his hand. It had a small nick on the rim, as if it had met a rock and both had survived, resentfully. He did not speak. He did not make wishes aloud in other people’s kitchens. He put the ring back on.

On Friday, at his lesson, Maren made him lie on the floor with a book on his belly while he sang vowels. The palm plant shivered as if it had heard something good. She had an envelope on the piano that said M. Ashbee and looked like it contained sea air. He did not look at it. He looked at the ceiling and how beautiful its cracks were.

“I feel ridiculous,” he said.

“Good,” she said. “Singing is embarrassing and the sooner you befriend that, the sooner you’ll have a good time.”

He laughed, and the book jumped up and down exactly the way breath should.

“Now sing something you are not ready for,” she said. “Sing it badly and see where you tear.”

He did. When it hurt he stopped. She said, “Good,” and he kept not crying because he had not, in his adult life, made a habit of crying in rooms with other people in them. He sang again. When he left she walked with him down the stairs and held the bannister in her hand as if it were the hand of a friend she trusted to hold her upright if she tripped.

“A week from Tuesday,” she said. “Can you do a slot at the Fox before my ship date? I want to hear you in a room that can bite back.”

“I can do a slot,” he said. “I can do any slot you want.”

She blinked, then smiled at something beyond him. “Don’t flirt with me,” she said kindly. “It’s not fair on either of us.”

“I’m not—” he began, and then let it go, because she was right and because there was dignity in not trying to trick anyone, even by accident. “Okay.”

She touched his sleeve. “You’re a good egg,” she said, and that was worse, somehow, because he wanted to be an egg only for her.

He walked away and let the city hold him up, brick by brick. He did not cross any bridges for hours. He knew he would go to the river if he did. He did not trust himself to talk to water and behave.

That night he finally went, because you can’t make a habit out of avoiding the one thing that keeps you honest. He took the ring off his thumb and held it in his palm and stood where the park made itself wild and the edges of things did not feel like edges but like breath. The spray kissed his face like a mother with flour on her fingers. He looked up at the sky. It was rude with stars.

“If I ask,” he said aloud, “it won’t be for anything you can hand me like a cup. I know that. I know you don’t give. You move. You teach by moving. So I’m asking— move and I’ll watch.”

The ring sat. He put it on. He decided that this was not magic. And decided, same breath, that leaving room for magic in your day kept your day from thinking it could predict you.

Someone laughed behind him. He turned. Two teenagers, a girl and a boy, holding a skateboard like a shield. The girl said, “Are you, like, reciting a poem to the waterfall? Is this your aesthetic? I support it. I just need to know what to call it when I describe it to my future therapist.”

He put his hands up, smiling. “This is me practicing for a gig I’m playing. It’s a waterfall audience. Very particular. Tips are in minnows.”

The boy looked at the ring. “That looks old,” he said, suspicion and respect braided in his tone.

“It is,” said Keith. “I think.”

“Take care of it,” said the girl as if appointing him to something he might not want but would bear anyway.

“I will,” he said, and the ring was warm, and the water made its endless spelling lesson out loud, all consonants, all ferocious S’s, and somewhere in the distance trains kept telling the dark where to put itself. He sang the first lines of a song he hadn’t written yet, and the city didn’t look away. He didn’t either.The morning after he sang to the teenagers and the water, he woke with a feeling like the room had been moved half an inch to the left and he now had to relearn where the corners were. He kept his eyes closed and tried not to chase the dream he’d had because every time he chased, the dream sprouted skates and sailed away. The line he’d recorded in the night waited like a dog by the door, patient, already forgivable. He made coffee, he held the mug in both hands as if he were trying to teach himself what steadiness felt like, and he sang very softly to the kitchen while the radiator argued with the season and lost.

He went downtown early and let Dani listen to the voice memo through the record shop’s decent speakers, the kind that gave even dumb noises dignity. The memo was half whisper, half gravel, all river. Dani tilted her head to the side as if she were letting the line walk from one ear to the other to see if it kept its shape. The shop smelled faintly of cardboard and lost parties, and in the front window a copy of an old Patsy Cline LP leaned as if it had rumors it would tell if you bought it a drink.

“It’s good,” she said, and when she said good it meant a thing that could become itself in front of people without getting shy. “You going to put words around it that let it move, or are you going to pin it to the page like a bug and then regret everything?”

“Are you available to be mean to me professionally?” he asked, smiling into his cup. “Because you’d be good at it.”

“I am mean to you because I love you, and because your songs keep using the word river as a noun when sometimes it wants to be a verb,” she said, eyes soft and mouth firm. “Did you get me my orchard untamed something? Ms. Wednesday has standards.”

“Not yet,” he said. “But the gods are already conspiring. There’s a porch twenty blocks west that I think grows cider just by putting apples in bowls and waiting.”

“Bring two bottles,” she said, and then made him listen to a woman he’d never heard of sing a song about fog that made him want to fall in love with anyone standing under a streetlamp. That was the thing about songs; they could make you a fool and then feed you afterward as if that had been the plan all along.

He worked with Téo on a riff that kept wanting to be polite and had to be taught a bad habit or two. The garage had a crack in the cement that made a tiny canyon that tried to catch picks as they fell, and a calendar with a pin-up of a mountain that always looked a month off from whatever month it pretended to be. They played until their fingers were a little clumsy and then stopped one song earlier than they wanted to because Téo had a superstition about not finishing after a train went by, which made no sense but held. On his way home Keith caught the smell of cold metal and damp leaves and let it rewire his day into a memory that hadn’t happened yet.

He called Alma from the bus stop because the wind was behaving like a voice, and if you let it, wind will tell you all its grievances and none of its secrets. She picked up and said, “There you are,” as if they had been mid-sentence for three weeks and he had just stepped back into the room with bread and excuses. He told her about the ring without trying to be clever, and she listened with the creaks and hums of her kitchen moving in behind her as chords.

“Elsie’s ring won’t be a key you turn and then the ocean falls out of a cupboard,” she said. “It will be more like a thing that keeps attention from wandering. We give up too soon. We get bored and call it wisdom. Put it on when you’re going to do a thing you might try to run away from.”

“I’m not going to run away,” he said, lying like a person who had very good intentions and a long record of ducking out the side door when the party got loud.

“You’ll try,” she said, merciless as ever. “And then you’ll come sag back like a sinner and start again. I love you. Come over Sunday. I found a shoebox full of postcards I stole from a flea market because the handwriting looked like it knew how to hold its liquor. We’ll pick one and make up stories.”

He promised and meant it, and then he put the phone in his pocket with the ring, and they knocked against each other, and he thought, Fine. You two keep each other honest.

The weeks that were meant to be six expanded like dough and then snapped back just as he was getting used to the stretch. He showed up to every lesson five minutes early with his voice already warmed and his mind pretending it wasn’t waiting for a particular laugh. Maren kept her promises like a bank that had never foreclosed on anyone, which is to say she did what she said, and she gave interest. She made him sing lying down again with the book and then made him stand with his feet too far apart and sway so he could hear the difference between chest and head like two rooms with a thin wall between them. When he asked if he should reach for the note she said, “It’s not high, it’s far,” and he let that change the way his ribs thought about height.

The day she brought her daughter because the sitter had a flat tire, the room rearranged itself without being asked. The milk-faced girl had grown a little, which is what children do, stubbornly, even when their mothers need them to stay small for a minute so a stranger doesn’t have to learn a new circumference. She carried a stuffed bear with one eye that had seen too much and wore a dress that had once been a shirt and would be a rag in a drawer in a year, and she walked right to the piano and put her palms on the wood like visiting a horse. Keith, who believed he could be calm around any creature if given precise instructions, felt immediately like twelve instruments at once, none of which had been tuned.

“This is June,” Maren said, her voice sliding into a register he hadn’t heard before, a quieter double that sat under everything. “June, this is Keith. He sings to the river to keep it from waking up cranky.”

June looked at him and then at his guitar case and then at his hands, and the assessment in her gaze made him straighten his shoulders and hide his most ridiculous impulses behind his teeth. “Your ring is shiny,” she said, solemn as a judge. “Is it a captain ring?”

“It’s a ring that thinks it knows stories,” he said, and took it off when she held out a palm as if he’d promised. It looked like a toy in her hand, a coin someone had punched a hole through. She turned it, squinted to see the letters, and then whispered something to it so softly he could pretend he hadn’t heard.

“What did you tell it?” he asked, because curiosity was the thing he was worst at resisting, even when it did not belong to him.

“That it should be a boat if it gets scared,” she said, and set it down on the piano as if she were setting down a frog so it wouldn’t get ideas. “Mama, can I draw?”

“You can draw,” Maren said, relief and affection braided together, and put paper and a cup of markers at the low table in the corner that appeared to sprout from floorboards whenever a child needed to be convinced that the world was not just for people with pockets.

They worked as June made a storm of purple and green. Keith found himself singing more cleanly when the small person did not look at him, as if the gaze of a child had less patience for fakery than any other being on earth. Maren didn’t coddle him, bless her. She stopped him mid-phrase and said, “No. You just apologized again,” and he tried to feel where that lived and scrub it out like a stain. He made a face and June laughed without turning her head, and he decided he’d keep that sound like a spare quarter in his pocket with the rest.

When he was putting on his jacket after, June came and handed him the ring with the gravity of someone returning a compass to a person about to get lost on purpose. “I drew you a river,” she said, and held up a page where a smear of blue had been crisscrossed by lines that might have been bridges and might have been strings on a harp.

“It’s perfect,” he said, and meant it too completely. “Thank you.”

Maren slipped the bracelet higher on her wrist and watched the exchange with a face that admitted nothing into court without documentation. “She’ll have your number now,” she said lightly. “You’ll get calls at midnight asking if fish can breathe.”

“Can they?” he asked before he could stop himself, then laughed at his own willingness to be fooled. “Go,” he told himself aloud. “Leave before your throat gets sentimental.”

Outside the bakery had decided to experiment with cardamom, which made the stairwell smell like a house where a saint kept her shoes by the door. He bought nothing and promised the air he would make up for this rudeness by bringing a friend later with less self-control. He tucked the ring more securely; the rip in his pocket had widened like a grin. At the top of the street he put the ring briefly on his middle finger to check the fit and felt that peculiar certainty again, not that he had chosen, but that he had been chosen by a detail that could have gone to anyone else on earth and for some reason had not. He thought of Alma and her bargains and said in his head to a thing that could not be offended, I will show up even when I could hide.

The Fox lobby was all gold thrum and winter light the day they let him stand under the chandelier and try his voice against marble. He had bought a jacket at a thrift store that made him look like a drummer in 1978 who had learned self-respect, and he had scraped the burn off his boots with his keys so no one would think he’d been startled by his own stove. The manager, a woman with a haircut that apologized for nothing, said, “Do a verse,” and then stood half-turned to the door like she was ready to let a whole city in if they asked nicely enough. He sang the line about the water forgetting and watched it go up the staircase like a cat deciding whether the balcony rail counted as a promise or a threat.

Maren was there, not on the schedule, not announced, just present, leaning against a column with a program rolled up in her hand like the baton of a kind orchestra tyrant. She nodded once when he caught her eye and then looked deliberately at the gigantic chandelier as if she was giving him privacy without leaving. He took the second verse into the dome and it didn’t break. The sound came back fat and relaxed, and he did not chew it. He held it in his mouth like bread, just long enough to know its exact shape, then let it go.

“Okay,” the haircut said when he stopped. “We like that.” She pointed the rolled program at him like a wand with boundaries. “The lobby wants you. Tuesday. Half hour. Be kind to the echo. She is a grandmother and likes being addressed.”

Outside, he leaned against the cold brick and laughed with his mouth closed, which is a difficult way to laugh and made passersby assume he had a secret he was welcoming home. Maren joined him with that step of hers that made you believe you were about to hear the real version of whatever was being discussed. “You felt it,” she said, no question inside the sentence at all.

“It felt like the inside of a church that never learned shame,” he said. “I almost cried, which would have been dramatic in a room that has twelve gold ladies playing harps on the ceiling.”

“You can cry,” she said, then made a face. “But not on the marble. It stains.”

He wanted to touch her sleeve and tell her that he had not said the most important thing about the song because he didn’t know yet what it was, and that not knowing felt like holding a door open for someone who might not come. He wanted to say he had bought a ring from a bowl in a shop that had a lamp with a face and not a soul in it, and that the ring had letters inside that seemed obvious if you were loyal to coincidence. He wanted to ask what he should offer a thing that had asked nothing and given him a mouthful of courage anyway. Instead he looked at his shoes and said, “How’s your packing?”

She sighed, the kind of sigh that told him she owned three sizes of suitcase and had experience regretting all of them. “Half-done. June thinks we’re moving to the moon. In a way we are. I keep trying to keep the house the same so when we come back the house will remember us. I’m renting the studio to a potter for the months I’m gone, so if you come up the stairs out of habit, don’t scream when you see a woman making a bowl.”

“I’ll scream very quietly,” he said. “Like a gentleman.”

She smiled, and that small line at the corner of her mouth showed itself for duty. “Don’t be a gentleman,” she said. “Be brave.” Then she put her hand halfway toward his shoulder and pulled it back, which was perhaps the most honest way anyone had touched him in years. “Go practice. Let the chandelier remember you.”

He practiced. He went to the river in the mornings and warmed up there until pigeons assembled above him like notes on a staff, and then he moved to the bridge where his breath had more room to be ungainly and then elegant. He sang in his kitchen with the faucet turned on because white noise will tell the truth where silence lies, and he sang walking uphill, and he sang in the alley behind the bakery because the smell of sugar forced him to choose: sing or buy. He bought once and then sang twice. Ms. Wednesday sent him a photograph of the pug approving of a different musician and he was not jealous, only fond, which counted as growth.

The night before the Fox lobby, he went to Alma’s and found her on the floor with the shoebox, laughing very quietly at the deliberate loopy handwriting of a man who had written from a resort in California in 1932 and had clearly wanted someone to quarantine his heart and had failed. They read five postcards and gave each a happier ending than the ink had provided. Alma held the ring and rolled it on the table like a coin she was trying to get to circle the same place twice. “Elsie cursed like a poem,” she said, apropos of nothing the way old women get to be and the way most conversations wish they could be. “Swedish swears sound like rain on tin. She was not a nice woman, which is why the river respected her. Nice is for cakes. She was kind when it mattered. There’s a difference.”

“What did she offer?” he asked, the question he’d been avoiding because it would require him to consider his own answer like a mirror he couldn’t tilt away.

“Oars,” Alma said without hesitation, as if someone had written it on her tongue in chalk. “When she needed something, she gave the river muscle. She rowed when she wanted to be carried, and the river loved her for the honesty. Offer that. Offer to give work when you want ease.”

He sat with that and with the apple pie she put in front of him, and with the way the kitchen clock hiccuped every hour instead of chiming. He walked home slower than usual, because the city had put on its best lamps and he had the feeling he would not get another October exactly like this one. He dreamed that the ring grew as wide as the moon and he walked through it like a doorway onto a deck where someone had left a coil of rope and a mug of something still warm, and the air was the kind that makes your throat feel like a prayer is a physical object you have to swallow.

The lobby gig folded him open. The first three notes were stubborn, as if the marble were saying, Convince me, and then the fourth opened and he stepped into a version of his own voice that he would have been suspicious of last year. He did the folk song that kept sneaking into Puccini’s house and then he did the new one with the line about forgetting that made him feel like he was bringing a bowl of clean water to a person who had been told they didn’t deserve it. People leaned on the railings and held their coats like loved ones and a child in a hat too big clapped on the off-beats with such commitment that everyone else adjusted to her instead of correcting her. He saw the usher, a man whose face had been carved by a generous sculptor, nod once and put his hand to his chest as if taking a pledge and then letting it go.

After, the manager widened her eyes at him in a way that meant a word better than good but that she did not want to spend the coin for yet, and said, “The winter festival wants you.” He accepted with a bow that was intentionally almost a joke and intentionally not. When he went outside, the sky had decided to start snow prematurely and then changed its mind, dropping just enough flakes to make the city believe in holidays for five minutes. Maren met him under the marquee in her moon coat and let him celebrate against the air, which is to say they didn’t touch and it still felt like contact.

“You worked like thieves,” she said. “You got away with it.”

“I had a lookout,” he said, meaning her and the ring and the chandelier and there was no way to say that without sounding like a person who had been writing in a spiral-bound notebook after midnight his whole life. “When do you go?”

“Eight days,” she said, and the number made a shape between them that was neither a wall nor a bridge but something else, some engineer’s idea of mercy. “June keeps putting pebbles in her pockets and telling me they are for weight. She says if she gets heavy enough she can keep the boat still.”

“She’s not wrong,” he said, and pictured himself putting stones in his own pockets, but of course you don’t need stones when the thing in you that loves somebody has the heft of a planet. “Can I—” He stopped because the space between what you’re allowed to ask and what you want to ask is a quaking bog and he had no boots.

“Ask,” she said, patient as a choir director with a row of fourth graders, which is to say, fierce because she expected excellence.

“Can I take care of the plant in the corner while you’re gone?” he said, and almost broke on how small the request sounded coming out. “The palm. I can get it to write me reviews.”

Her shoulders dropped as if muscle had been waiting for that exact favor to carry. “Yes,” she said. “Please. I was going to ask Dani to remind me to ask you. It’s finicky about light. It wants praise and it wants you to move it a little to the left and then back when it notices. Like a soprano.”

“Like me,” he said, and she gave him that line at the corner of her mouth again, pronounced now because she did not stop it. He made himself step back into the cold and then pretend to fuss with his scarf until the feeling passed enough to let him function without doing anything either heroic or regrettable.

At the porch party in Browne’s Addition the next night he found the orchard thing Dani wanted, bottled with a label that used the word untamed three times like a dare. He played on a wood deck that knew more about rain than about dancing and watched breath lifts from mouths in puffs that made the air look like it was learning cursive. The mustard hat girl appeared with a different hat, this one blue, and told him she had gotten promoted to closing on Fridays and that grease did indeed taste like work done, and he wrote down her words this time without making a joke and later he sang them back to her in a way that made both of them look at their shoes.

The band argued about whether a song needed a bridge when it already had three verses that did good work. Téo said bridges were capitalist and unnecessary and Dani, who had come by the garage to return a record and stayed as people stay when they intend to leave on the third minute and then on the fifth and then on the eighth, told him he didn’t know what he meant but she loved him anyway. In the middle of all that talking, Keith felt the ring go cool against his thumb as if it were reminding him to choose to pay attention. He slipped it off and set it on his amp while they played and when he reached for it between songs he found it had slid toward the edge and hung there, and in the single second it took his hand to cover it, he imagined it falling into the oil-dark dust under the couch and vanishing for three months. He closed his fist and put it into the rip of his denim’s breast pocket, then pushed the fabric down with two fingers to make the rip smaller. He knew enough to take care of a thing before it demanded drama.

On Sunday he walked the river with Alma because she had declared the day required it and you don’t tell certain women no if you want your life to keep spinning. The wind came off the water like a cousin who has just discovered practical jokes and cannot stop. Alma wore a hat that made her look like she’d argued with an upholsterer over the price of a couch and won, and she told him the part of the story where Elsie had sworn off engines for a year after a fire and used a pole and a crew and her own back to get a barge through a part of the river that men called impossible because they wanted to remain the authorities on failure. “She took off the ring,” Alma said, eyes on the near water as if the other water, the remembered one, would agree to meet her halfway. “She put it in her mouth. She said it was either that or lose it to the current that was being a petty god that day. When she coughed she tasted metal and a little blood from her teeth. She was delighted by the way courage has flavor.”

He didn’t know whether the story was true or had become true through many tellings, and he did not care. He tucked the ring between tongue and cheek like a kid hiding contraband and tried to imagine that taste. It made him salivate in a way that told him something substantially unromantic about bravery, and he nodded to the river like men do when they pretend they have not just been taught something by a woman. He put the ring back on and thought, This is the bargain. Work when I want ease. Keep the ferry moving. He did not say it out loud because he’d already said more aloud to water lately than he might be able to explain to a reasonable person.

Two days before Maren’s ship date, he climbed the narrow stairwell with a bag of groceries that contained exactly the things the studio needed to smell like people had been kind to one another: oranges, dark chocolate, a loaf of bread so fresh it still dreamed, and a small jar of honey from a man at the market with bees in his beard. He found the studio at that atmospheric tipping point where a room has begun to unpeel itself from an owner’s attention. The palm had put two leaves down like a protest sign. The posters on the wall held on, but the edges had curled to listen. The radiator hiccuped under his boot when he tapped it, a little burp of apology.

“I found your favorite honey,” he said, putting the jar on the piano like an offering. “From the guy who names his queen and then changes it every year because he says leadership should always be rotational.”

Maren took the jar and cradled it for a second like you might hold an egg to feel the temperature of the morning in your hand. “You’re ridiculous,” she said, but not as a censure. “Thank you.” Then she did a thing that would have been nothing if it hadn’t been everything: she handed him a key. It was tied to a scrap of ribbon the color of dried sage and it had two teeth, which made it look like it could bite what needed biting.

“It’s for the plant,” she said, because you can always say the simple thing when the larger thing is shaking the windows. “And for the piano too, if it gets lonely. And if you need a room that knows your voice. And because I trust you, which might be poor judgment, but if so, I will correct it when I get back by stealing your jacket and never returning it.”

He took the key and found, behind his ribs, a place that had not existed the day before. “I won’t change anything,” he said, and then shook his head because that was a lie in a very specific sense. “I will only water and move and sing. And maybe eat all your chocolate.”

“You can leave me one square,” she said. “Or you can write me a song and hide it under the rug. Either is acceptable.”

They didn’t prolong the goodbye because both of them had read books where people did that and it had gone badly for the furniture. He carried a box down the stairs that contained seashells and a tea kettle and an old program with her name printed wrong and a photograph of June in a raincoat glaring at a puddle and he held it as if it were heavier than it was because some things deserve that theatrics. At the car she hugged him with a briskness that proved it counted. Her hair smelled like cinnamon rolls had gotten the better of her that morning, and he tried, like an athlete, to put the hug into muscle memory without making a shrine of it.

After she left he sat in the studio by himself and ate the entire loaf of bread with the honey, which seemed like an appropriate ritual in the religion of Being Left By Someone For A Very Good Reason. He sang to the palm until it put its leaves back up like a soldier called to attention for a cause just realistic enough to hurt for. Outside the bakery turned its sign to closed and the streetlights clicked on with that spectral municipal patience they have. He stayed long enough to watch himself from the outside and decide he was not romantic, he was merely alive.

He played the winter festival and invited Alma and Dani and Téo, and they all sat together like a family that had agreed to share the best parts and the worst parts without doing math. Ms. Wednesday brought the pug, who wore a sweater it despised, and June and her babysitter stood under the balcony and yelled his name as if he were a hero in a pantomime and had perhaps left his shoe behind on purpose. He sang the new song last, which made him feel like he was stepping out on a frozen river and trusting the math in the ice, and when he finished the lobby breathed in, then out, and only then did people clap. He bowed, less a flourish than an acknowledgement that applause exists because hands want to meet each other in the air sometimes and have an excuse.

When he got home that night the apartment did the page-turn noise again and he said to it, “I see you,” and put the ring on the table and set the key next to it like two small moons that would keep his tide manageable. He did not sleep much and did not feel punished for it. In the gray middle of the night, when the train told the dark where to put itself again, he took the ring in his fingers and said what he had promised himself he would say. “Work when I want ease,” he whispered. “And look without lying.” He put it back on and felt not magic but agreement, which was better.

The day Maren’s ship left Seattle, snow finally committed and made the city pretend to be made of paper. He took the earliest bus and then the later one and then he walked because roads had opinions. On the water he watched a boat that was not hers and told himself jokes to keep the edges from sharpening. He texted her nothing dramatic, only a photograph of the palm with its leaves glossy and a caption that read, Soldier status: currently obeying orders. She sent back a blurry picture of June making a face at a life jacket and a single word: Aye.

On the way back to Spokane, he wrote a song called Untamed Orchard just to give Dani her bottle a proper home, and he filled it with the names of all the apples he could remember from a childhood that had eaten more store brands than trees. He got off the bus two stops early because the river needed to be crossed on foot at least once a day in weather like this, and because he had a ridiculous sense that the heron might have come to collect him. The bridge stung his ears and he loved the bite because it carved his listening. He leaned on the railing and took off the ring and held it to feel if metal remembered heat and cold the way flesh did, and when he slid it back on, he felt held to his own bargain as if a knot had been tied and now was the time for rowing.

He sang one line to the water and then another, and the city did not mind. Somewhere behind him, under the white, someone started a car with a sound like a stubborn heart getting back to work. He would walk to the studio and check on the plant. He would call Alma and ask her to tell him a lie so big it came back around into the truth. He would go to the record store and give Dani her bottle and receive instructions from her eyebrows. He would push Téo’s van and eat a pastry he didn’t need and find the shop with the lamp that had a face and buy something no one asked him to. He would work when he wanted ease and he would try not to lie to water or to anything else, and if he failed he would sleep and start again.

He did not feel messy or tidy. He felt like a man with his feet on a bridge and a ring that might have belonged to a woman who swore in rain and a teacher who was a moving horizon with a child and a plant and a sea to cross. It was enough purpose to hold him upright without bending his joints into somebody he’d read about. He put his hands in his pockets and counted his quarters, planet by planet, as they moved toward his ribs. He knew the names of none of them and they did not care. The river, performing its endless spelling lesson, slapped every letter out of its throat, refused to be done, and the day, seeing no reason to disagree, kept going.Winter took the river by the sleeves and taught it to keep its temper in public. On the bridges, he could look down and see how ice negotiated with current, how the water wore a lace of patience and then ripped it off around the pilings, how a heron could stand shin-deep in water that claimed to be asleep and never was. Keith made a practice out of rising before the sky had committed, standing at the rail with his breath making a small, immodest cloud, and telling the day out loud that he would work when he wanted ease. The ring sat on his thumb like a promise you made with your eyes open. He put his palm to his ribs before he sang and listened for that lake he and Maren had established between bone and muscle, and when his mind tried to bolt, he moved his attention back by naming what he could smell: cold iron, the library’s heat kicking on, someone’s wool, a faint sugar blow from the bakery like a rumor you don’t fight because it makes you gentler.

On Mondays and Thursdays he let himself into the studio with the key she had tied to sage ribbon and pretended that rooms kept diaries. The potter had arrived with boxes that smelled like wet earth and lemon oil, and her wheel in the corner spoke a quiet language of persuasion. Her name was Lila and she wore aprons that had once been curtains, and when she centered a lump of clay, Keith felt his own breath choose its axis without drama. She showed him how her hands rode the wobble until it stopped wobbling and became the bowl it had meant to be all along, and he sang scales while she lifted edges into light. The palm, willful as ever, demanded to be moved half a foot and then back, and he obliged it and told it stories about the river’s temperament like a ridiculous uncle who has decided the ficus must be educated in local history. The piano’s middle register wanted a tune-up and wanted to be thanked for wanting, so he obliged that, too, picking out harmonies until he found himself by accident playing the chord where everything he missed and everything he wanted sat like two coins in the same pocket and did not fight.

They talked about rhythm in the band and argued about bridges with an intensity that would have made strangers assume they were solving access to bread and not an arrangement of chorus and verse. Téo insisted that a song should walk until its feet knew the route and not build a span unless the river required it; Keith countered that sometimes your body couldn’t leap the gap without a little grace thrown under it. Dani rolled her eyes and declared she would start a separate band called The Span and accept only players who could admit they liked handrails, then she put him in front of the shop speakers again and made him listen to a woman from Florida sing a thing about mangroves that had the same vertebrae as his river and used the verbing of water with a stubbornness Dani approved. Ms. Wednesday, persistent as weather, wrote him with a solstice party invitation and a warning about guests who wore velvet on their heads and had firm opinions about wassail. He told the Larches he’d split the night, band first at The Quarry, solo second in a living room, and they grimaced and then grinned because they would have done it in his place, because that was the deal with friends who knew what your hunger sounded like.

A week in, a voice memo landed in his phone from a number he had not saved under her name because he would have looked at it and made prayers complicated. It began with wind and then with June saying something that could only be described as a loud whisper, and then Maren’s quiet came through as if the ocean had agreed to step back and hold her coat. She said the ship smelled like rope and disinfectant and onion soup, and that one of the stage lights had a personality like a jealous goat, and that June had learned to stand with her knees wide in a way that made sailors nod and keep their amorous metaphors to themselves. She said the Pacific had a gray he didn’t know yet, he would love it, and she put the phone out to catch the sound of gulls that cussed in a language both familiar and invented. He walked the long way home listening twice, then a third time, then left her a reply where he held the phone against his sternum so she could hear the way his breath had obeyed her absent hand, and he told a joke about the palm enlisting and reported that the chandelier at the Fox still knew his name without claiming any name of hers in return. He recorded a verse about forgetting and sent it without explanations, because songs explain themselves if you let them travel without chaperones.

Alma caught him in the produce aisle with a handful of kale as if she had never trusted a vegetable but had decided to make a flirtation of it now. She took his arm and steered him like a cart to the church basement where the rummage tables turned into a neighborhood’s internal organs once a month. She introduced him to a woman whose hair was two countries at once and whose eyes had learned to write footnotes, a retired engineer named Greta who kept a card in her wallet that said Riverkeeper Volunteer as if that meant nothing and everything. Greta had collected stories about Elsie Norwood like sailors collect knots; she had a binder with newspaper clippings full of misspellings and a thin map with pencil scars. She said Elsie’s first words as a baby had likely been a swear, and that the old woman had learned Swedish curses because her father had built a boat with a man from Malmö who could coax a jammed gear with a prayer that sounded like anger and then laugh when it moved. She told Keith stories about the year of low water when Elsie had run excursions upriver to sell beer to men whose wives had declared a dry month, and the spring she tied two barges together because someone said she couldn’t. “She wore a ring,” Greta said, almost like she was accusing him and absolving him in the same breath. “And if this is it, which it isn’t and is, depending on what you need, she put it between her teeth when the bend at Devil’s Elbow refused her. People say she spit in the river and the river spat back good fortune, but I suspect she set her back to the pole and someone else romanticized it. Doesn’t make it untrue. You’re young enough to hold two things in the same palm without them slipping out.”

Keith nodded and told her about the bowl with the lamp that had a face, and Greta said of course she knew that shop, she hated that shop, it was where she bought all her happiest objects. Alma stood by the table of used mugs and put a hand on the lucky ones as if she were blessing them to find good mouths. He looked at the ring and thought of oars and teeth and the flavor of decision repeating itself until it tasted like metal you depend on. He listened to Greta list the names of bends as if they were saints and then watched the way her jaw worked when she ran out of facts and kept going with faith.

The Fox lobby in December believed in itself the way children do when they put on boots for the first time and stamp to test if the floor will hold. He tuned by feel because the air was too bright to hear properly and because he had learned to put his ear under his own voice like a bowl. He slipped in the new song where Dani had insisted he let the river verb and watched faces lift as if the marble had called their chins to attention. On the back wall, a shadow of his mouth made its own decisions. Between verses, the heater coughed out a laugh. He did the verse about forgetting that wasn’t forgiveness and then turned it sideways and let the forgetting be mercy and found that some people in the second row exhaled as if a stubborn zipper had finally moved. After, when he was still half inside the song and half inside his coat, his father was suddenly beside him like a tree revealed by a flood receding. The man didn’t say much, he never did; he said the lobby reminded him of a time when money had merits beyond measurements, and he said that a man in a hard hat had told him his son was the one with the voice like a smoked ham, and was that a compliment, and Keith laughed and said it was the highest honor, and did his father have time for pie. They went to a diner where the waitress called everyone by names that were probably made up, and they ate and talked about the mill in terms that were affectionate and rude. His father asked one question about Maren in the exact tone you’d use to check if your son’s furnace filter had been changed, and Keith answered with the same pragmatic affection, yes, taken care of, efficient, don’t worry. When they parted in the parking lot, his father pretended that his gloves made hugging technical, and then did it anyway, the kind of embrace that comes in a workshop edition, permanently stained and exactly sized.

He almost lost the ring the week the cold cracked and then forgot itself and tried to be spring for a day. Lila had put her glaze buckets in a neat row like stubborn moons, and he had laid the ring on the piano to tune her radio and then, in a fit of housekeeping, swept it with a stack of junk mail into a bag that went straight to the recycling bin. He noticed in that late, stomach-dropping way and then went to his knees in the stairwell with his arm inside a plastic bag that had become a mouth. Lila, who had the calm of someone who has failed a hundred small ways and turned each into a pot, found it an hour later glinting at the bottom of the throwing water, the ring improbably clean, the letters inside polite under the tannin swirl. She held it up with the tips of two fingers like a surgeon with a tool, and he felt his chest go light and stupid with relief, then embarrassed by the scale of it. “It left a mark,” she said, and showed him the faint ring the metal had pressed into the clay slurry at the bottom of the basin, a perfect circle that would get wiped away with the next clean, and for a second that impermanent dent looked back at him like a face he recognized as his own. They made jokes about not pushing the symbolism too hard and then both pushed it anyway and wanted more. He put the ring back on and admitted that he was not the kind of person who could love a thing lightly and call it freedom, and she said that a line drawn around a bowl kept soup in and mouths fed, and he supposed that was enough of a defense for boundaries to hold water.

He brought Dani her bottle, a dark glass with an antler on the label and the word untamed repeated with the nervousness of a copywriter who had never been in a field in their life. They drank it behind the register out of teacups because the proper cups had been permanently loaned to a regular who had never returned them. Dani made her face, the cat smelling the sewer while secretly liking the sewer, and then admitted it tasted like apples that had read poetry and taken it too seriously. She had him play a three-song set for six people who had not planned to listen to live music on a Tuesday and who left having told at least one stranger a story that had embarrassed them in a useful way. Ms. Wednesday came with the pug and the pug wore a scarf and then removed it with contempt and sat on Keith’s foot like a reminder that affection has weight. After closing, Dani told him in a voice so flat it wore a burrow in the air about a girl she had loved in Montana who had left because the fog had made her think she was a bad person, and he did not attempt the magic trick of making this into a lesson, he only said that fog does that, and then he played her a song about mangroves and they let the detail of trees with their feet in salt suggest that survival could look like a complicated root and still be beautiful.

On a Thursday when the buses were having a religious dispute with the ice and everything that wanted to be on time had to admit its limitations, he took a train because steel likes an argument with weather. He carried a cutting from the palm in a jam jar swaddled in two scarves to a woman in Ballard who had inherited a windowsill and a south-facing ache from a friend who was also Maren’s friend. He did not try to see a ship or a face; he watched the Sound and let the cranes draw hieroglyphs across the slices of sky that opened between warehouses. He wrote three lines on a receipt about gulls that only got the joke when it was mean and then threw the receipt away not because the lines were bad but because sometimes you practice discipline by letting the practice be the point. On the train home a man across the aisle tried to sell him a knife that had belonged to his grandfather, and he listened and bought nothing and still managed to honor the idea that people sometimes have to turn stories into money just to keep gravity on their side.

A package arrived wrapped in paper that had known three other lives and string that had been saved from a previous knot. Inside was a shell with a notch in it that made him think of mouths that forgot to be soft, and a postcard with a map of islands he could not pronounce with a line drawn in pencil like a seam ripper across blue. The writing was June’s and read like a weather report from a planet that only spoke in nouns and declarations: Mama says my feet are the boat. The water is not a bath. A bird ate our sandwich, the rude. Can fish breathe is a secret. He sat at his kitchen table with his pen like a shovel and wrote back on a blank card he had been saving for no reason other than saving felt like thrift which felt like control on days he had none. He drew gills on a boy with a wide grin and told the truth sideways the way you do for children and animals and yourself: fish do not breathe like we do but they pull what they need from water like it is a song and they know the notes, and also yes, some birds are rude, and if your feet are the boat then you can always go home. He did not overthink the stamp. He did not put his own face inside the message except where he could not help it.

In January, the river’s bones showed. The city wore salt like it had dandruff and tried to pretend it didn’t. He found himself volunteering to carry sandbags for the old Atwood place when a thaw ran too fast and tried to make a name for itself. He went because Alma said, don’t call a flood a surprise when the snow told you its intentions all week, and because he had promised a ring an unromantic bargain. He filled and tied and lifted and set while his breath made plaid in the cold. He sang under it without thinking, the steady low of labor that had a single vowel in it and announced nothing while keeping time, and at some point one of the Atwood boys started to harmonize with a baritone so clean it felt like a floor swept for a dance, and they worked without easing up until someone said stop in a voice that sounded like finish and not quit. The ring went warm in the glove and then forgot itself and turned back to metal again, and he thought, fine. Nobody applauded. The water rearranged itself without permission. The yard kept its furniture.

One night when the snow made the whole neighborhood adopt the hush of a sickroom, he let himself into the studio late with the excuse of moving the palm a fraction to the left and stayed because the room asked him to. Lila had gone and taken her clay’s damp with her, and the piano sat like a horse that had forgotten what it was for and might be insulted if you reminded it wrong. He lit the little lamp with the shade of linen that softened things without lying. On the inside of the piano lid, behind the tape that held June’s milk-face photo, there was a corner of paper like a shy tooth. He lifted it, careful as you are with old mouths. A ticket stub, Reykjavik torn neatly through the v like a resigned blessing, and on the back in pencil someone had written a single instruction—breathe through the note like it is wind and you are the flag—and maybe it had been for her or from her or for anyone who had ever thought they had to hold their own ribs together. He put it back and closed the lid and did as told and sang for nobody and the room gave him a soft applause of radiators and settled boards. He did not cry because he had gotten better at placing his admittances where they did some work and did not require mopping, but he did feel the way a man feels when the night hands him a folded paper with his own handwriting on it that he does not remember making.

By February he had stopped talking about what he missed like a theory and started talking about what he loved like a verb. He sang in kitchen and garage and lobby and room with pots, and he said yes to four weddings that would pay for his rent and three funerals that would pay for something else entirely, and he put his voice into the bodies of these rooms and then left and did not argue when they gave him back a version of himself he could use. He went to the shop with the lamp that had a face and bought nothing, and the man behind the counter nodded at the ring like it had grown on Keith’s thumb the way lichen grows on a rock that has agreed to hold still. He went to Ms. Wednesday’s and sang a lullaby to a cat that had no intentions of sleeping and he failed gloriously and accepted a cookie that had been made by someone in a battle with butter and losing kindly. He received three more voice memos from the ship where June had renamed two crew members and learned to swear in a language that did not exist yet, and he heard, in the way the line on the memo flattened and rose, the pitch of a woman who was neither lonely nor unlonely, who was doing the work she could never quite not do. He sent back pictures of the river in its different jackets, its silver, its pewter, its black, its improbable sapphire when the sky had lost its mind.

On a morning so clean it read as a dare, he stood under the Monroe Street Bridge where the iron made its big piano of shadow and sang the folk song that kept sneaking into impossible rooms and getting applause anyway. A man in a safety vest stopped, looked irritated with himself for stopping, and then asked, not unkindly, if they paid him for this or if he had to pay someone else for the privilege, and Keith laughed and said he paid a river tax with his breath and the river occasionally returned it with interest. The man nodded like he could respect a barter system that wasn’t written down. When he finished, the city exhaled in gray, and pigeons edited the sky into punctuation marks, and his quarters traveled toward his ribs like planets patient with their own orbits. He touched the ring and felt, not magic and not its absence, but that he was, in that moment, doing the unembarrassing work of keeping his oars in the water. He thought about the map with pencil scars on it, about June’s rebellious knees, about Lila’s hands making circles like ripples, about Dani’s kindness so sharp it cut slack’s throat, about Alma’s kitchen clock hiccuping reality, about Maren somewhere under a different gray, both their breaths making bargains across absence that held because they kept rowing. He thought about bridges and whether they were capitalist or useful or both, and then he crossed one, then another, and laughed because a thing could be necessary and pretty, and a man could hold two truths in the same palm without losing either, and the day, finding no reason to disagree, went ahead and made itself into a story he would tell differently tomorrow.The thaw came on like gossip, not all at once but in sharp bright pieces that pretended to be nothing and then gathered into truth. The ice at the river’s edge unstitched itself politely for a week and then ripped, the seams popping in flat slaps that made dogs turn their heads. Keith learned the new vocabulary with his boots— the slick confessions where a puddle looked matte and turned out to be the opposite, the softings under the top crust where the ground remembered its November softness like an old affair. He kept up his morning treaty with the bridge and the ring and his ribs, and he traded his wool scarf for something lighter but still stubborn, and he watched the pigeons begin their arguments in tones that suggested they had opinions about municipal budgets. When the sun did show, it came in hard like a bailiff, aggressive with consequence; when it didn’t, the city let its gray fall to the shoulders more gently and everyone wore it like a cardigan they didn’t remember buying.

Greta called with a voice that sounded like a clean wrench turning, and she said the Riverkeepers were pulling trash out before the runoff decided to marry it to the banks for a season, and would he come, because men who sing to water ought to do the ugly work too. He said yes with his mouth and then said yes again with his calendar because the second yes was where bargains lived. He put on gloves that had been other men’s and felt their ghosts settle around his fingers like practical advice. They hauled tires that had turned into habitats, coaxing out spiders with humor and sending them back into the grasses as if they were colleagues clocking out. They lifted a chest of drawers missing drawers and dignity, and Greta told a story about a couch that had once floated as a sermon and taken love letters out into the channel to teach them humility. He found a brass tag that had belonged to something that had belonged to a boat, the letters punched in with a hand that knew both drink and care, and he held it up and the ring on his thumb had the sensation of nodding, which he scolded himself for noticing and noted anyway. Greta pocketed the tag with the authority of a docent and promised to bribe a librarian with cookies to let her into a file cabinet built in 1918, and Keith believed she would.

In the studio, Lila’s kiln learned the word hot and set about proving it. He helped her load shelves with greenware that looked like ghosts of bowls and mugs not yet sure they deserved a mouth, and she explained cone temperatures with a patience he envied. She spoke about vitrification like a hymn, about how sand and ash decided to become glass when you insisted enough without burning the insistence into cruelty. He touched a rim too soon after it had left the kiln and the ring flashed heat into the skin under it, a surprise debt, and Lila made him put his hand in a bowl of water that smelled faintly of clay and lemons and said, without drama, that most work announced itself with a bite. He told her about breath and ribs and how a note isn’t high, it’s far, and she made him sing an A while her hands steadied a vase finding its center, and both of them met their targets in the same second and grinned like children who had successfully stolen cookies under adult noses.

Dani turned the record shop into a church one Thursday at noon by putting up a handwritten sign that said Please Be Quiet, Song Occurring, and everyone obeyed with an eagerness that proved they had been waiting to be told to be reverent. She introduced a community radio woman with hair like a competent storm and a laugh that made crates hum, and the woman recorded three of his songs on a device small enough to be magic and promised they’d be aired between a late-night bluegrass show and an hour where a man read from a book about mushrooms in a tone better suited to confession. Ms. Wednesday materialized from the jazz section with a bottle labeled with antlers and promises and said without an ounce of apology that her velvet-hatted friends had declared him acceptable and would be having him in March if he brought a harmonica player who didn’t hate himself. He told her he could arrange a player to hate only his harmonica and she awarded him the tiny nod of approval an archangel might give a mortal who remembered to return a borrowed book.

His father started leaving him voicemails that were fifteen seconds of a truck’s interior and five seconds of saying the mill had hired three kids who would get bored and quit, and then, always, a sentence about the weather phrased as a dare, as in, “You think you can sing against this wind?” Keith called back and told him he could and that he did and that he didn’t expect to win, and his father made a noise that meant pride in a language men are taught with stingy dictionaries. They met once for pie and the man asked the price of the honey jar without asking, and Keith lied and said five dollars so that he wouldn’t have to explain beekeeper economies, and his father told a joke about bees unionizing that was funnier because he believed it could happen.

The messages from the ship arrived like postcards a city could hear. One was all wind and then June telling him in a voice that had learned how to march that she had a whistle now and if she blew it men did things, and then Maren explaining that the galley windows had given names to all the waves as if that would make them behave, and that the stage light goat had been replaced by a light with the personality of an aunt who remembers everyone’s birthdays and uses that power when she needs to. Another was nothing but silence and then the sound of a line being coiled and a laugh he could tell had been strangled and then released on purpose, and it felt like she had left a door open for one second and he had stood there without stepping through. He sent back a recording he made at midnight in the studio, a lullaby that was more a promise to breathe than a tune, and he put the phone on the piano so the wood could loan him its calm, and he did not say her name because the room already knew it.

Alma had a dizzy spell that made her sit down with an expression that told gravity not to get ideas. He went with soup that had three kinds of green in it and too much garlic, and he watched her color climb back into her face by ladders. She told him more about Elsie in that half-narrative way that knits truth out of threads that don’t sit still. There had been a man named Hjalmar, she said, and she’d never known if that had been a first name or a last, but he owned a forge on a corner with a tree that bloomed too late, and when Elsie limped a boat into town with a crack in her ribs and in the boat’s, she had paid the smith not with money but with the ring because the coins had all been on the wrong side of somebody’s ledger that week. He had fixed the keel as if it were a living thing and then he had kept the ring until his wife said it made him act like an idiot, and then he had thrown it into the river during a fight and had to apologize not to his wife but to the water for his bad aim. Alma’s laugh cracked like kindling, and she said that if you’re going to throw a thing away you should at least respect the thing and yourself and throw properly, and he agreed and fed her more soup because that was the easier world to manage.

He found himself being a teacher one Saturday by accident when Lila’s niece, a girl with a jaw like decision, came into the studio and said she had to sing for a school thing on Monday and did not intend to humiliate herself. He sat at the piano and pulled Maren’s phrases out of the drawer where he had been storing them, trying hard to keep the cadence but not the heartbeat of a person he loved. He said, “No apology in your throat,” and the girl glared correctly and obeyed; he said, “It’s not high, it’s far,” and watched her body understand; he said, “Imagine the note is a ferry and you are not allowed off until you arrive,” and she rolled her eyes and then nailed it. When she left, she handed him five singles folded like a threat and he tried to refuse and she said, “Don’t steal my dignity,” in a tone that made him stand up straighter, and he took the money and put it in the palm’s pot because dignity grows better with company. After she left he sat very still and admitted that teaching set small fires in corners of him he hadn’t been using, and he told the ring, which was telling himself, that he would not steal anyone’s dignity, not by accident and not by ritual.

The Larches got asked to open for a band from Portland who had a name that made no sense and a drummer who wore his hair like a religious conviction. The show was in Walla Walla in a room that had trouble deciding whether it was a bar or a barn, and Téo said the van could do it if you coaxed it with lore and not with logic. Dani negotiated fifty dollars more than the room wanted to give out of sheer stubbornness and some charm, and they went, eating pretzels that tasted like salt mines and making up verses about every town they passed through that would have earned them exile if they’d been speaking to crowds and not each other. On the way back a fog rolled in that looked competent and cruel, and they pulled over on the shoulder while the world reconsidered visibility. Keith took the ring off his thumb and put it in his mouth while he got out to move a branch and felt the metal kiss on his teeth like he was biting a coin to see if it was counterfeit, and he thought of Elsie’s blood and spit and courage tasting like a festival of bad choices, and he laughed and didn’t tell anyone why he was laughing because he couldn’t explain without sounding like he believed in a talisman more than he believed in his own feet. Back in the van, the heater coughed and then coughed again and then committed, and they made it home with the fog still believing in itself and the city pretending it had received an invitation it could refuse.

When he got back from that trip, a voicemail from Greta waited with the meaty satisfaction of a job well begun. She had been into the 1918 file cabinet and then into a drawer that had been painted shut and then into a box that had been labeled with a lie, and she had found a photograph of a woman on a deck with a hat that had decided not to obey gravity, laughing at someone outside the frame, and on her thumb a ring that was either this ring or a cousin, and the woman had a mouth that would not be denied anything for long. Greta’s voice softened on the word thumb as if the placement mattered, and it did, and Keith went to her house with flowers that looked like they had meant to be fireworks, and they sat at her table and ate sourdough with apricot jam and looked at Elsie grinning across a century. The ring in the photograph had the same stubborn line on its edge as his did, a tiny nick that made an imperfection into a hallmark. He did not trust his eyes completely, he knew better, but he let the idea that this was the ring move into his chest and take up a chair anyway. Greta put a finger down on the photo like a tap for emphasis and said that women who swore like rain needed a place to put their hands, and then she told him she was taking him to the bend called Devil’s Elbow in March when it would be at its worst so he could hear how a river denies and grants with the same mouth.

Two nights in a row he went to the bridge and found the teenagers again, now with three more friends and a dog that looked like someone had drawn a dog from memory. The girl who had appointed him ring steward the first time told him she had learned how to ollie and that it scared her enough to prove she was alive, and the boy had a bruise under one eye in the shape of a question he refused to answer. Keith sang to them because it felt appropriate, quieter than his breath most days, and he watched them not listen and listen simultaneously, which is a skill adults forget. He took the ring off and let the girl hold it again, and she cradled it like a goldfish and then handed it back without saying the word mine, which he appreciated because possession is the stickiest spell. She asked him if he had ever driven west until he ran out of west and he said not yet, and she nodded as if she had expected nothing less from someone who sang at water and took it seriously.

The studio taught him new verbs. Lila said the clay slumped, and then she said it remembered, and then she said it fought, and he liked that fights could be honorable when both sides agreed to learn afterward. The palm decided it wanted different light in a way that made him swear at a plant, and then he laughed and apologized to a plant, and then he told no one and told everyone with his hands when he moved it with excessive care. He found the courage one afternoon to slide the rug back and leave a folded paper under it with a song on it not in words but in instructions for breath written like a recipe, and he wrote at the bottom in tiny letters that could not be read without cooperation, Work when you want ease, and he replaced the rug and laughed at himself because he had just made a shrine and called it a prank.

The house shows multiplied. He sang in kitchens where the island had been built by someone who had loved the wood, and he sang in basements with fairy lights and exposed wires behaving themselves, and he sang in a room where a twelve-year-old did a headstand during his second verse and held it the entire time, each breath a small miracle of geometry. Ms. Wednesday brought a cousin from Boise who told a story about falling asleep under a pool table and waking believing in a different god, and Keith sang softer for that and then louder for the man with the thin ponytail who came back and did not cry but smiled like he had found a dollar in an old coat. He made friends with a woman who hosted and talked about snowshoe hares with an expertise that convinced him hares ran the city at night, and she told him he sang like someone making a case for mercy without admitting pleading is productive, and he wrote that down because flattery that smart should be captured before it evaporated.

On a morning mean with wind, he tried for the first time to go a whole day without the ring to prove to himself that he didn’t need an object to obey. He put it in a saucer by the window, and the metal looked under the gray sky like it had its own weather, and he stepped into the world with his hands naked. He sang well enough. He remembered to work when he wanted ease a few times and failed a few times and forgave himself once or twice and called that balance. He put his hand to his ribs before a high note and found the lake without fishing, which pleased him, and then in the late afternoon he reached automatically for his thumb and felt its emptiness like a mislaid word. He went home and did not snatch the ring; he picked it up like he was meeting it for the first time again, and he told it, or himself, that liking a ritual is not a crime if you can set it down for a day and remain yourself.

The river swelled under nights that were warmer by ten degrees than anyone wanted, and the sandbag lessons returned with the same faces and new ones. He made a habit of bringing a thermos and two extra pairs of gloves, and he surrendered to the clean fatigue that came after four hours of lifting with men and women who had met only as bodies doing a thing that needed doing. Alma watched from the porch because her dizzy spells had been spoken to and were behaving, and she called out suggestions like a coach who had decided not to let retirement have the last word, and he pretended to be annoyed because that was the ritual, and she laughed and told him he moved like a man who wanted to be admired by mud. He told the ring he was offering oars and not asking for anything he could spend, and the ring kept its counsel and stayed warm enough to be noticed only when he remembered to notice.

The band fell into a fight about a bass line that had started as a suggestion and turned into dogma. Téo accused the line of being commute music and not road music, and Dani accused both of them of thinking in slogans when what they needed was listening, and Keith sat on the edge of a case and watched the two people he trusted most argue in a way that felt like thunder politely keeping its distance. He stepped in only when the temperature shifted from productive to pride, and he said, much softer than his authority warranted and more honest than he wanted, that the song would tell them if they shut up long enough, and then he made them play the chorus six times as if it were a prayer, and on the seventh time it told them, and they both made identical faces of reluctant gratitude, and he felt stupidly blessed by the way music sometimes behaves like a very patient animal. They drank beer that tasted like pine cones and apologized in the language of men, which consisted of changing the subject and fixing a thing on the amp together and saying, “You good?” with shoulders not with eyes.

A storm hit the Pacific the week the crocuses made fools of themselves, and the ship went silent for three days. He told himself and then told the ring and then told the river that radios fail for reasons unrelated to anything he loves, and he believed himself exactly as much as a man believes his own best lies. He sang more to the palm than usual and watered it slightly too often and Lila scolded him without malice and he stopped, because obedience is a virtue you can practice on plants before you try it on bigger things. When the message came it was June describing thunder like someone moving heavy furniture above them, and then Maren saying the boat had grown a second spine for the duration and would return to its proper number soon, and that the men who swore and the women who swore sounded exactly the same under weather, and that if she could she would send him a square of the color the ocean had been at noon when the storm pretended to be over, and he let out a sound that he would later claim had been a cough because admitting the body’s relief was sometimes more intimate than a nakedness. He sent back the sound of Spokane buses throwing themselves into the day like reliable comedians and said nothing else, and she sent a one-word reply that was a laugh you could hear in black ink, and the day it came he sang better, not because magic but because a muscle had unclenched.

Greta’s Devil’s Elbow trip demanded boots and snacks and a willingness to admit that men had once named things with a flair for melodrama. They drove with the heater pretending to be brave and walked the last half mile because a road had disagreed with the idea of being useful and lost. The bend lived up to its name if you wanted it to, and if you didn’t it was simply a kink in a river that refused a straight line because straight lines have other careers. She told him where the steamboats had struck pride and where they had shrugged and moved on, and she stood with her hands in her pockets like she had to keep them from gesturing at history in a way that might rewrite it. He put the ring in his mouth for a minute because the wind wanted to make decisions for him and he refused, and he tasted metal and maybe his own blood because his lip was chapped, and the courage flavor was there, ordinary and unglamorous and persuasive. He imagined Elsie with a pole and a crew and a mouth that had no patience for anyone’s failure theater, and he felt idiotic and glad and present, which are not mutually exclusive if you are honest.

He invited his father to a show in a town his father disliked on principle and the man came anyway and stood in the back where he could leave if it embarrassed him. Keith watched him watch and adjusted three choices mid-song because loving a person sometimes means tuning to their silence. After, his father said two words that meant forty, and Keith nodded and did not correct the math, and then they walked past a mural that fancied itself immortal and both of them agreed what to call the color that wasn’t any color they knew. Dani looped an arm through Keith’s and told him he was becoming insufferable in the exact right ways, and he told her to kick him in the shins if he started quoting himself as if that were wisdom, and she swore to be ruthless.

In March, a school asked him to sing at an assembly where the principal had determined that the theme was resilience, a word that made his skin crawl and his respect grow depending on who held it. He sang three songs, including the one where the river forgets but does not forgive, and afterward a boy with a jacket that had known two owners said, “My mother says forgetting is a luxury,” and Keith said, “She isn’t wrong,” and the boy nodded like someone who already knew the world didn’t part for declarations. A girl asked him if he had ever lost his voice and if it had felt like losing his name, and he told her about the week after he’d been sick when all his notes sat stubbornly on the floor and refused to be picked up, and he told her about breath as a practice not a right, and she took that as if it were both promise and assignment, which it was, and the principal tried to make it about resilience again and failed in a gentle way.

The shop with the lamp sold him a harmonica in C that had been used hard and well and cleaned by someone who put care into things that didn’t pay them back. The man behind the counter said it had belonged to an uncle who had taught himself while fixing roofs and then quit because roofs were easier, and Keith liked the honesty of that and paid without asking for a discount even though he could have won one with a joke. He brought it to Ms. Wednesday’s so that the velvet hats would be appeased, and a woman in gold pants played it for five minutes and made everyone else quiet from respect and then refused to be thanked in any way that would stick, and he admired her greed for refusal.

The plant did what plants do when you talk to them too much— it grew in ways he hadn’t planned. It put up a new frond like a flag and then another, and he resisted the urge to send a photograph every time because the world did not need more evidence that he could be sentimental. He wrote the words work when you want ease on a small card and stuck it in the pot’s soil under the first thin layer like a secret that would be discovered only by someone curious and nosy enough to be a friend, and he considered for a second that hiding advice under dirt might be the truest way to give it.

One evening, in the half-hour between the river and the shop, he saw a boy on a bike slide out in that terrible ballet the thaw teaches and land with both palms and both knees and his pride on the asphalt. Keith went over and said a lot of words that meant stay still without being a command, and he helped with a napkin he did not know he had and the ring clicked the boy’s handlebar in a sound he would remember later when he tried to reconstruct the afternoon. The boy refused tears like a job and got back on with breath held wrong and then corrected it without being told, and Keith wanted to applaud, and didn’t, and thought that teaching might always feel like wanting to clap at people for the small ways they heal in public.

He began planning for a spring that would include the winter festival’s last echoes and a small recorded session in the Fox after hours with a mic that looked like a prop from an old film and behaved like a priest, and he felt a clean run of nerves that tasted like a new kind of sugar. He wrote to Maren about it and she wrote back in a punctuation that belonged to a person who had discovered that sea calendars and land calendars tell different jokes, and she told him that June had taught a cook to pronounce Spokane correctly and that he should be grateful forever and perhaps send a certificate. He sent the child a drawing of a certificate written in his worst calligraphy and left enough blank space for her to decide what authority he thought he had and whether to allow it.

He did a small thing that no one would have praised and he felt like writing a poem about it and he didn’t. He came home one night, tired in the way that means you have spent yourself like exact change and gotten a thing of value, and he took the ring off because his thumb felt honest but heavy, and he put it on the table and said to the air, “I will work when I want ease,” and then he made a sandwich that was too simple to deserve a name and ate it standing and watched the steam from his tea curl in a way that made him think he could trust physics, which was more than he could say for most things. When he lay down, he did not dream of the ring or the river or the woman on the ship; he dreamed he was standing in a field under a sky that had been freshly polished, and he could hear the train telling the dark where to put itself and the dark refusing and negotiating and then agreeing, and in the morning he woke with the taste of metal in his mouth and laughed because sometimes your body writes poems without asking your head’s permission.The equinox came with a rumor of warmth that did not keep its promise, and the city forgave it because winter had been long and forgiving is what you do for things that mostly behave. The Fox unlocked its big doors late one night for the recording session, and Keith carried his guitar like a confession into the lobby, where the gold ladies on the ceiling seemed to pull shawls up to their chins and listen. The sound engineer was a woman with cropped gray hair and a patience that had survived decades of men trying to outsmart microphones; she introduced herself as Ruth and patted the ribbon mic’s stand like it was a horse that had earned its rest and still agreed to run when you asked politely. “Don’t sing at her,” Ruth said. “She’s unreliable when flattered. Sing past her. Give her the air and she’ll do you the favor of being honest.” He nodded, and the chandelier cleared its throat the way it always did when it decided to be part of a conversation.

He warmed up with the vowels Maren had drilled into his ribs, letting the sound climb the staircases and come back washed. When he began the one about forgetting and not forgiving, his hands stayed steady on the strings as if they had been promised a future and were willing to work for it. Ruth stayed behind the board with her eyes half-closed, not mystical but absorbed, nodding minutely like a person counting a thing and finding satisfaction in the arithmetic. He did three takes, then a fourth because the room demanded a last look, and when he stepped back his mouth tasted like copper and cinnamon, like nerves and bakeries, and he thought, I am not embarrassed to have done this, which was new enough to count as a superstition.

Ruth played the last take back and the sound made the lobby feel like a temporary cathedral for a religion that refused rules except the one about breath. “You’re not hiding,” she said in the neutral tone of someone who would have told him if he was. “Don’t hide. You’re not interesting when you hide.” He laughed because it was true and because relief often wears the same coat as humor. She had him sing the little folk song that sneaked into rooms it had no invitation for, and on the second verse he let his voice slip into the size it wanted and didn’t apologize afterward. They finished too late to salute anything but the moon, and he walked out with the files living in a small, expensive rectangle like a set of birds folded into a pocket, and even the neon in the Fox’s sign blinked once in what he was willing to call approval.

Dani cried at the radio when his recording aired between mushrooms and bluegrass because it sounded like him and not like a trick, and then she marched him around the shop and told anyone who had ears that she had once taught this man the difference between river noun and river verb, and that she expected royalties in the form of cider and secrets. Men and women he didn’t know began telling him what songs had done to their mornings as if songs were people who had stopped by for coffee unannounced and been forgiven because they made the room better. Keith accepted praise like a bartender accepts coin— with gratitude and a sideways glance lest he drop it and look unprofessional— and he filed away their faces because you should memorize the people who give you courage for free.

The Larches noticed the radio attention the way a band notices anything that might alter gravity. Téo came into the garage with two coffees and a face that was trying to be casual about an ache behind the eyes. He set the cups down and said, “We need to talk about the river of you and the band of us before we start being weird about it later,” which was how grown men admit they are capable of fielding a feeling without weaponizing it. Keith nodded and said, “I want both,” which was honest and therefore risky. They talked until the heater in the garage threw up its hands and demanded maintenance, and by the time they had agreed on nothing except the fact that they were not enemies, they had also agreed to write something that belonged to all of them, a song with a spine that wouldn’t survive being separated.

Greta called during a rain that thought it was important, said the runoff was coming hard and would he meet her to look at the bend while it was practicing its worst manners. He met her with boots he had reproofed with a care that felt like superstition, and they walked the last half mile while the air mispronounced their names. Devil’s Elbow was not a metaphor that day; it was an elbow thrown in a bar fight by a man with kind opinions who had run out of patience. Logs punched past with a lethargic power that fooled you until you tried to resist it. Greta pointed at a boil in the current and said, “There,” like a teacher telling a student where the music hides in a bar of notes. He pulled the ring off his thumb and tucked it against his molars because wind asks for offerings and he refused to give it his caution. The water carried on with its own curriculum, uninterested in his teeth, and he let the taste of metal locate him back in his body in the way nothing else had ever quite learned to.

A boy slid where the bank had decided to be less firm than a minute ago, and the two seconds it took him to flail looked like a lesson written too small to read. Keith lunged without making it about heroism, just about weight and angles, grabbed the back of the boy’s coat and gravity kept its end of the deal. The kid swore in a way that suggested good coaching, got his feet under him, and stood with his breath borrowed from someone else’s pocket. Greta nodded once like an old general, and Keith kept his mouth shut because you don’t narrate what your body did fine without your opinion. Later, over thermos coffee that had the generosity of bad coffee shared outside, Greta said, “You’d make a decent crewman,” which in her language was a laurel. He told her he preferred being paid in songs, and she said, “Same currency,” and he loved her for that.

Alma fell in the kitchen and called it a dance rehearsed with the wrong partner. He found her on the floor with her hair angrier than usual at gravity, and she let him help her up with a dignity that made him look away from her hands so he wouldn’t embarrass either of them. They sat while the kettle did its job and she took her own pulse as if she were a colleague who expected professionalism. “I am fine and old and that means sometimes I test carpeting,” she said, and then she asked for a story as a fee for worrying her and he gave her one about Ruth and the ribbon mic and how kindness can be technical if you do it right. In return she told him a piece of Elsie’s life that she hadn’t yet remembered, which meant she had remembered it on purpose for the pleasure of telling it now. “The last time Elsie took the long run, she went without drinking because the ice had held on mean and someone had to get flour and candles to a parish that still thought prayer fixed roads,” Alma said. “She lost the ring at the bend everyone lies about, and she said she didn’t mind because it hadn’t been hers for a while anyway. It turned up a year later in a sturgeon’s belly because the world refuses our tidy endings. Hjalmar cooked it with butter and illegal herbs and the man who discovered the ring in his teeth stopped swearing for two days, which for him was a miracle. You can decide if that’s true. If you decide wrong, nothing breaks.”

He dreamt that night of a fish with a ring in its gut that kept interrupting its own path to demand better scenery, and he woke to the sound of tires bargaining with thaw. The studio, when he went, smelled like wet clay and lemon oil and the air before a choir tries its first note. Lila had added a small, impossible bird to the shelf, a ceramic thing so light it looked like strategic air with glaze, and she said she’d made it while thinking of the way he held notes as if they were coins he might need later. He took that as a compliment and an admonition. The palm’s new frond split like a hand learning sign language, and he texted a picture to the ship because he could not help himself and because the world’s soft reports deserve witnesses.

“Dock day,” came Maren’s reply four hours later, the words shaped by a cell tower that believed in its work. He called and she answered with wind and then pinned her hair behind her ear in a gesture he could hear. They talked like colleagues and like people who had not been able to have the same room for a while. She told him about a cook who had decided to reinvent lentils with a flamboyance that made men doubt their own tongues, and a deckhand who could play Bach on a guitar with four strings and a string of curses that could make the gulls blush, and he told her about Ruth and the ribbon, and about the way the river looked when it pretended to be two rivers at once and only he cared which was which. June stole the phone and reported that fish can breathe if you are polite about asking them, and he agreed and added a clause about consent for gills, and Maren laughed in a way that put his back muscles in order without touching them. “You sound taller from the inside,” she said. “That’s not a metaphor you can use without permission, but I give it.” He said he had taught a thing and not done harm, and she said, “Of course you can teach. You’re greedy to share when you’re not afraid,” and he wrote that down later and put it in his guitar case where the plectrums live so he’d have to see it.

He sang two porch shows in Browne’s Addition under a sun that had just remembered its job, and on the second one a woman with a hat that looked like a cake told him that the line about forgetting but not forgiving had arrived in her kitchen right when she needed to stop making a romance out of regret. He nodded and put his hands on the porch rail and felt the wood make a deal with his weight. He gave Dani the second bottle of untamed orchard something and she poured a small sacramental amount into a teacup and they drank to spite and to mercy without naming either, and she said he was getting unpalatable in the way artists do when they’re improving, and he told her to slap him gently when necessary, and she promised in a tone that did not include gently as an option.

His father called and asked if he wanted to fish because the river would be showing off for the next week and you might as well take advantage of a show-off before it gets tired of itself. Keith got up before anyone sane and let the cold tell him to be specific. They stood on the bank with coffee that did more as a handwarmer than a beverage, and his father taught him three knots and a patience he did not own yet, and they didn’t talk about anything that mattered until the sun had gotten bored of being interesting. “Doctor says I need to treat my heart like equipment I want to keep,” his father said into a pause that had earned its silence. Keith looked at the water, then the man, and then the water again because love requires angles. “Okay,” he said, and then he said, “I can make soup that’s secretly a salad,” and his father made the noise men make when they have been told they might live longer and would therefore need to learn what kale is.

In the studio, a man arrived with a box that had the shape of a mixer and the self-importance of one, and he installed it for the potter who was trading rent for sound while she worked at night. The man’s name was Lars because naturally it was, and he had hands that looked like both gentle and unavoidable. He asked about the ring as if it were a tool, and when Keith showed it he smiled with his mouth shut and said, “You wearing your work like a promise. Good,” and left before Keith could decide whether that was advice or family. Lila rolled her eyes and said he was harmless and occasionally useful and that letting him name anything would be a mistake, and Keith decided to trust a woman in an apron with lemon oil on her sleeve more than a man who could install a mixer without consulting the spirits.

The Larches wrote the song they had promised the garage, and it came out louder than their usual because restraint has to be broken occasionally to keep it from becoming ossified virtue. They called it Bridges Are Useful because Téo refused to let it be called anything delicate, and Dani declared the title ugly and perfect, and they played it out behind the bakery for pigeons and sugar until the pigeons got cocky and the sugar turned into a craving they couldn’t afford. The part where Keith’s voice had to ride over a drum fill and then rest on a bass line made him feel like a person who could stand up on a moving train without looking for a rail. After the run-through, they sat on milk crates and made the jokes that keep love from rotting, and he told them about Greta and the elbow and the logs, and Téo said he would marry a river if it would do the dishes, and Dani said she’d marry a river only if it agreed to shut up about destiny, and Keith loved them both in that unembarrassing way that doesn’t require candles.

Ms. Wednesday introduced him to a woman named Ingrid at a house show, a retired organist with a ring identical to his except that it was not identical at all, and she told him in a voice that belonged in a lecture hall and also in a barn that Swedish swears were not so much curses as weather reports uttered with conviction. “We have a word that means the kind of help that hurts,” Ingrid said, adding the Swedish he would not pronounce correctly even with bribery. “Björntjänst. Bear service. Don’t do that. Don’t help your songs so much you ruin them. Don’t announce your river ring as if it makes you interesting. It doesn’t. You make you interesting if you work.” He thanked her and meant it, and later he took the ring off and put it on the table while he tuned his guitar and felt, for once, no panic at the distance between thumb and silver.

He felt the temptation to talk about himself in third person increase in proportion to how often people told him he was making a thing they needed, which was exactly the moment to tell himself not to become a bore. He carried sandbags twice more and did the boring work of lifting without story, and afterward a teenager with a fresh buzz cut asked him if he was the guy from the radio and he said he was just a guy with a voice and gloves who knew which way to shovel, and the kid seemed relieved at the smallness of that, and Keith counted that as a win.

The week before April made a promise it might keep, he got a letter with no return address, just his name and the studio’s street, written in a hand that made you want to stop slouching. Inside was a single photograph, the same one Greta had shown him but printed from a different source, the woman in the hat laughing at whoever dared imagine she’d pose properly. On the back, in pencil that had seen decades of kitchen heat and human oil, five words sat, not quite stoic, not quite tender: Keep your oars in, boy. He took it to Alma and she sniffed the paper like a detective and declared it had been kept with onions, which told her what she needed to know about the sender. He asked who, and she said, “Everyone,” and he accepted that because it was usually true.

He said yes to a small tour that would take the band west and then south and bring them back in time to pretend to be new at the winter festival’s spring adjunct, because Spokane loved to pretend it was still winter when the calendar insisted otherwise. The tour would mean three nights in a van with dreams and three in motels where the pillows lied about their uses, and he packed the way a man packs who thinks he might be someone else halfway through and then forgives himself for not being. He left the ring in its place on his thumb because ritual is not a law, but it is a lane, and lanes keep people from crashing into each other as often. Before he went, he watered the palm and told it a completely true lie about the duration of his absence, and he wrote a note for Lila about the way the radiators like to be spoken to when they forget their manners, and he put a card under the rug with two new lines: Don’t do the bear service. Clean your own teeth of metal and go on.

On the road, they fought once and laughed five times as hard to make up for it. A room in Olympia made them sound like they were playing inside a wool coat and they leaned into the muffling and let it turn them gentle; a room in Portland made them sound like the inside of a bell and they took care not to fracture. After the second night, a woman with a face that belonged to a person who had sparred and healed asked Keith if he had a song for people who wanted to love someone they shouldn’t and knew it and did it anyway, and he told her he had three and a half and none of them would help, and she bought a t-shirt he had not authorized because sometimes you support an ecosystem and do not count losses when they count as somebody else’s groceries.

He called Alma from a gas station that had decided to be a museum of beef jerky, and she told him the snow had finally given up trying to be relevant and that the hares had changed costumes, and that Greta had found another clipping about Elsie that proved nothing and everything. He called the studio and Lila reported that the palm had tried to make friends with a draft and been rebuffed, and that he would have to make peace between them when he returned, and he promised to be as diplomatic as a man has a right to be without lying. He did not call the ship because he had nothing to say that a wave hadn’t already told it, and because sometimes you keep the line clear as a form of respect not of shame.

On the last night of the small tour, somewhere that smelled like wet wool and beer with an agenda, a man in his sixties stood in front without troubling to look like he belonged and listened with the stillness of someone who has been trying to be found. After, he introduced himself as a friend of Ruth’s from the Fox, and he told Keith he was ready to put a small amount of money behind an EP if Keith was ready to be bored by decisions, and Keith nodded because boredom with this kind of consequence counted as joy. He texted Dani and she sent sixteen exclamation marks and one eye-roll emoji and then a clause about contracts and mouths and not letting men who smelled like money shave your vowels. He texted Ruth and she responded with a single “Okay,” that meant the opposite of indifference.

He came home with the van making a noise that had not been in the brochure, and he took the ring off because his thumb had been a thumb for days without complaint and deserved a break. The studio smelled like lemon and kiln heat and bakery ghosts, and the palm had put up one more tentative frond as if to ask if it would be rude to flourish while the room’s owner was at sea. He read the card he had left under the rug, and then he left another that said, in small letters, It’s not high, it’s far. He put the ribbon mic on his list in a way that made him feel like a thief planning to return the stolen thing and keep the memory.

That night he dreamed he was on a deck with a rope that understood him and did not care, and that the ring weighed enough to cut his skin and did so, not cruelly but to draw attention. He woke and the room had the quiet of houses that remember more of you than you meant them to, and he lay there and let the sound of the train argue with the dark, each telling the other where to be, both convinced and both wrong and both generous with their mistakes. He got up and made coffee with more attention than was reasonable and practiced the habit of working when he wanted ease until it stopped feeling like judgment and started feeling like salt. Then he went to the river not to be dramatic but because it was what his feet knew, and he stood at the rail and sang the first line twice because the first line wanted company, and the city, sentimental as ever, allowed it.9

The first meeting about the EP happened in a room that used to be a dentist’s office and still had the polite lighting of a place where people had agreed to open their mouths and hope for mercy. Ruth set up the ribbon mic on a stand that looked like it had grown out of a root and tapped a little patch of gaffer’s tape onto the floor where she wanted him to be as if she were placing a small X on a map he already knew. The walls wore thick curtains the color of theater velvet that had seen too many hands. Outside, the street hustled without hard evidence that it would get anywhere by hurrying, and Keith stood with his fingers on the neck of his guitar and pretended he wasn’t counting the beats of his own heart because he was tired of being the man whose work was always in conversation with his pulse.

They were boring right away, which relieved him. Paperwork. Options like doors that all looked the same when you were in the hallway. Ruth said oldest thing you own, newest song you are not embarrassed by yet, and one that is a lie you can tell convincingly and feel bad about later. He laughed because she was taking care without sounding like she was. The money man—who introduced himself as Ken and then apologized for his shirt like he owed the world a better pattern—asked if any song had a chorus that belonged to more than one singer and would the band be included, and Keith said yes in the way you say yes when you are writing a list of difficult phone calls you will make after you finish being brave in the room. They arranged dates like you arrange chairs for a conversation you hope will not turn into a cross-examination. Ruth left him with the mic and said she’d press buttons when he forgot to breathe, and he told her he had a ring for that, and she said good, let the jewelry unionize, and quietly left the door ajar so the hallway’s lack of expectation could leak into the room.

He started with the folk song because it always pretended to be simple and then insisted on being true. The ribbon mic listened as if it had been promised a cigarette. He kept his voice close enough to warm the air but not so close as to fog it. Between takes Ruth lifted one finger when he went to apologize for something he had not yet done and he shut his mouth and held still until the apology turned into a different sound that might be useful. He recorded the river line twice, then a third when he realized forgetting had a rhythm and he had been holding it too tightly. When he took his hands off the guitar they trembled the way hands tremble after you have carried something heavier than anyone would have asked you to. Outside the window a bus sighed itself into a stop and then back into movement and he loved the municipal faithfulness of that.

He wanted the band on the one that had grown a spine out of arguments in the garage, the thing that finally agreed to call itself Bridges Are Useful, and bringing that into Ruth’s carved-out air meant coiling a cable around a habit. Téo arrived with his sticks in his back pocket looking like a man who had promised himself two cigarettes but would settle for none if it made the song better. Dani came with two coffees and the expression people wear when they are prepared to like a fight if necessary. The bass player, Oliver, said hello in a voice that normal conversations do not require and that made the boards under their feet accept the day. They crowded into the not-dentist’s office and arranged themselves in a geometry Ruth approved. The first take was four people wanting to help and doing the bear service without meaning to. The second got worse. The third held still. Ruth, from behind the control room glass, put her hands up like a crossing guard and made them listen back, and what they heard sounded like four people who had agreed to stop talking in order to finish a sentence.

After the take, when laughter came because you have to let excess current exit somewhere safe, Keith held the ring against his lower lip as if it were a harmonica and inhaled the echo. Ruth pressed the talk button and said you can do another but you have the one you came for, and they believed her because she had been right about harder things. Ken stuck his head in at the end with a question about mixing that felt like asking a mother of four if she would like to divide a cake with a chainsaw, and Ruth answered for them with a tone that made the room feel temporary and protected, and Keith added a polite clause about wanting the bass to be a floor and the vocals to be a window, and Ken nodded like a man told to take his hands off the controls and delighted to discover he wanted that anyway.

The week wore its working clothes. Sandbags, strings, the fox-gray lobby, the old palm putting up a new green spear with a shamelessness that made Keith feel both fond and ridiculous. He taught Lila’s niece how to turn a breath into a plank she could step on and not fall through, and she glared and then softened and then showed up two days later with a recording of her school performance and a cupcake that had survived a backpack. He took the cupcake and the recording like gifts from a church that had decided he was a member because he showed up reliably. Greta called to say the bend looked like a lazy snake today and that it was lying, and he went because lying rivers were his religion now. Alma said her dizziness had packed a bag and left, and he didn’t trust her but he allowed himself to be comforted by the fact that her laugh had regained its dirty ration of newsprint.

One afternoon he crossed the Maple Street footbridge because the Monroe felt too much like a habit. The river below argued with rocks that had been present for a century and would continue their policy of showing their teeth. He sang nothing; he let his breath travel through vowels without asking them to work. Two teenagers skated by, the girl from the first day and a boy he did not recognize, and they had new scabs like badges pinned to knees. “We built a ramp,” she reported, as if he had been awaiting a public works update. “It collapsed gloriously. We learned about weight distribution, which is boring until it throws you.” He told her about the ribbon mic and the bear service and how you could ruin a song by helping it too much, and she frowned as if she were deciding whether advice about art had anything to do with wood and wheels and bruises. “Same,” she said finally. “You overthink the landing and you probably deserve gravel.” He wanted to applaud the way she arrived at truths by parts, and he did not, because adults clapping at children with gravity turns the moment into a sticker.

That evening a message bloomed on his phone like a bruise arriving: a voice memo that began with rain running down metal that hadn’t gotten used to its own job. Maren sounded like wind had learned good manners for the occasion. She said they had hit weather that wanted to be named after a god and had been disappointed, they had been turned back once and then gone on anyway, a dance you do with larger forces when you know your steps and respect your feet. June shouted in the background about a jellyfish that tried to recruit her and a cook who had tried to teach a potato to behave like a cloud. Her laugh wove through all of it like a ribbon on a dress that a child had decided to wear backward. “We’ll be at dock in two days,” Maren said more softly. “The kind of dock that’s only a dock in the mind. Not Seattle. Not a place you can take a train to. But I’ll stand still for an hour and think of the river that names itself after acts instead of things. How are you.” He recorded the radiator’s small applause and the palm’s hush and his own quiet between vowels, and he said, “I am being boring in a useful way,” and he told her about Ken’s shirt and Ruth’s patience and the teenager who knew about gravel, and he did not ask for anything, which was a relief.

The relief lasted an hour and then he wanted more. He went to the shop with the lamp that had a face and asked the man behind the counter if he had any more rings that had forgotten what they were made for. The man said he had a tray of guilt from the nineteen-seventies, a jar of aluminium spoons that wanted to be bracelets, and a small oval frame with a photograph of a dog that looked like a senator. Nothing was a ring. “Good,” Keith said, because being satisfied with one old circle was the kind of discipline his life had not encouraged in him. He bought the spoon bracelet for Alma and the dog photo for Dani because she liked to accuse animals of having jobs they would be bad at, and he practiced the muscle of walking out without more talismans than he could carry.

Ken insisted on taking them to lunch at a place with tables that had handwriting under the glass and a menu designed by a sly clerk. Ken talked about mastering like a man choosing wallpaper carefully, and Téo got itchy and confessed that any time he sat across from money in a daylight establishment his instincts told him to run toward noise. Dani told a story about a man who had tried to pay her in promises and how she had converted them into dish soap through threats and charm. Keith ate his sandwich and listened to the two halves of his life talk across him like parents who had decided not to use the child as the battleground. He realized he had not put the ring on that morning and wondered how long it would take his body to stop checking and then he decided not to be precious about it and to put it back on in the bathroom like a man fixing his collar. In the mirror he looked unremarkable and thanked whatever gods handled the distribution of normal faces.

The first day of mixing, which he had been told would test his patience and find him wanting, felt like school he could stand. Ruth drew shapes in the air with her hand as if EQ could be coaxed into behaving by choreography. He learned to tell the difference between the sound of Oliver’s low strings and the hum of an old wire pretending to be useful. He learned how close his s sounds sat to a harshness that made Ruth squint and pull a slider that calmed everything down like a grandmother with tea. Three hours in, his ears mutinied and insisted on hearing nothing but the belly-slap of his own breath. Ruth sent him down the stairs for a pastry he did not earn and could afford. He stood in the bakery with cardamom on his tongue and admitted that boredom, as predicted, felt like a luxury. He brought Ruth a cookie because you feed your saints without making a fuss.

At home that night, he answered two emails that wanted him to sing for free on the grounds that exposure warms, and he said no with a kindness that had teeth in it, and he said yes to a community center that paid in check and gratitude and asked for three songs half in Spanish, which he could not do without help. He called Dani and she coached him on vowels that would not embarrass him, and he wrote the phonetics in a notebook he had been saving for better ideas and told himself that being wrong in front of people was an honor if you did it with humility. Alma left him a message where she sang, badly, a line about sturgeon and the flavor of courage, and he saved it because people who sing badly for you are telling you they think you are safe.

The invitation to go west for one day came the way weather comes when your house has a window that remembers storms. Maren said Seattle, twelve hours, a stutter-step near the pier where the ship would take on souvenirs and leave off regrets. He said he would come and then checked his bank account and said he could come and then looked at the calendar and said he should come, and then he told the ring nothing because saying anything would make the moment wear a costume that might not fit. He caught the earliest bus as if the bus were a string he could pluck and get a clean note from. The Sound wore the kind of gray that made you want to sit and inventory your courage, and the ferries moved like declarations that did not care if they were poetic.

He waited where everyone waits, in a wrong coat, with a paper cup whose lid had decided to leak in solidarity with an old grievance. When the ship shouldered up to the pier like a thing that had learned to aim, he felt his body do what bodies do in old paintings: it leaned. Sailors did the math that allowed hope to masquerade as routine. She came down the gangplank with her hair behaving like accountability and June’s hand in hers, and they looked like what they were: two people with a single itinerary and different ideas about what it included. He felt every rule he had made for his dignity wake and sit up straight. He waved with a restraint that cost more than money, and June broke free with the permission of a rope learning to be slack and ran at him with the speed of a new person testing gravity. She hit him with enough force to make his ribs breathe like a bellows and then announced he was taller from the inside, which he translated into a blessing he had no right to.

They had a park bench that had seen thousands of small treaties. They said all the things people say when time is an animal they don’t know how to feed. She asked about the palm and he told her it had put out an arm and she asked about the ribbon mic and he told her it insisted on honesty, and she told him about a passenger who had taught her how to sleep on a moving bed without making it an argument, and about a woman who had fallen in love with the way the aurora pretended to be tame and had to be talked back from the rail gently with sandwiches. June drew a ship on his hand with a pen and told him the names of three crew members he would never meet and gave each a superpower that had to do with knots and pancakes. She asked if fish could be persuaded to breathe air if you asked nicely, and he said only if you invented new airstuff, and she scoffed because adults have no imagination. He wanted to take her to the aquarium, to a bookshop, to a clock repair, to the river’s mouth and back, and the hour had no intention of allowing any of it. He bought them coffee and hot chocolate that scalded and remembered itself, and he watched the way Maren’s fingers curved around the paper cup and understood too much and not enough.

There is a thing that happens when you don’t touch someone you want to. The air thickens and then thins as if it is practicing being both a barrier and a bridge. He kept his hands visible like knives in a kitchen. She touched his sleeve once and then stopped, the honest gesture that had tried for his shoulder and corrected. “You sound good,” she said in a way that told him she had listened to the ribbon broadcasts in her head and did not need him to show his work. He told her about the message from a woman in a hat that looked like a cake and how the song had landed in a kitchen like a utensil and made sense of something unpalatable, and she laughed in the careful way public laughs require.

The hour took itself back in increments, petty and fair. They said goodbye under a crane that was doing a saint’s work without being called that. June tied an invisible knot in the air and said it would hold if he promised to sing to it, and he promised without irony. Maren leaned and kissed the place his cheek made when he swallowed, which was a violence he forgave immediately. “Work when you want ease,” she said like a curse she had decided was better used as a blessing. “Keep your oars in.” He watched them go back up the gangplank and thought about how you can love a person and not be ruined by it if you don’t insist on declaring ruin your brand.

On the bus home he wrote a verse about benches and cranes and paper cups that leak in solidarity, and he fell asleep with his head against the window and woke with the taste of metal in his mouth that belonged to neither coffee nor regret. He lost his wallet for ten minutes on the floor of the bus and found it again under his seat with two lint-covered pennies stuck to it like they were joining a union. He came back into Spokane like a person who had decided to talk to the river about something besides himself for once. He went to the studio first because the palm would need to be informed of its continuing responsibilities. Lila had left a note on the bench that said rehearsals tonight, please don’t sing, and he obediently didn’t, and he watered, and he moved the plant a half-foot to the left and then shuddered at his own predictability and moved it back. He found the folded paper under the rug because he had to, read his own handwriting with the suspicion it always deserved, and left a new line in case anyone had been counting: Don’t narrate the work while you’re working. Let your hands finish their sentence first.

The days after felt like a man cleaning a house he had decided to live in for longer than he had initially planned. He did the community center songs half in Spanish with a humility that kept his mouth out of trouble, and an old woman with a cane taught him one vowel with her eyebrows and accepted his gratitude with a courtesy that would put some priests out of a job. He met Ruth for a final pass at the mix and noticed how the ribbon mic made his s into something he could stand to hear, and he surrendered to her taste where his had been loud and unhelpful. He bought Ken a drink and told him he was grateful for shirts with bad patterns because they taught a room how to behave, and Ken looked sincerely offended for three seconds and then laughed in relief that someone had finally told him the truth about his closet.

He took his father to a cardiologist who wore a tie that admitted small defeats and a face that had seen more men learn this lesson later than they should. They left with a list and a bottle and a resigned respect for salt and a promise that soup could save lives if eaten stubbornly. They went to the diner and did the acceptable exchange of fears disguised as insults, and his father called the honey a show-off and then conceded he liked being shown off to. He took Alma a plant he had no business telling how to grow and she placed it near a window she had convinced to behave like a friend, and she told him a final thing she knew about Elsie having to do with thieves, which was that she hired them sometimes, the honest ones, because people who know how to take without imprint can put a boat back together without making a brag of it.

When the masters came, when the songs were suddenly something that could be sent across town and set on a shelf and forgotten by people who don’t need them and clutched by people who do, he did the ceremony alone in his kitchen that he had planned not to have. He put the ring in its saucer and the key next to it and the small rectangle of sound on the table like a trio of saints whose church did not require kneeling. He said nothing out loud because that felt like asking for roses when bread would do. He made toast and buttered it to the edges as if he could teach himself not to leave any good thing unfinished. He took a bite and listened to the building settle and the train remind the dark what to do with itself, and he decided that satisfaction and appetite could stand next to each other without fighting if he asked them to.

He went to the river in a coat that knew his shoulders and stood where he always stood and let the day not be about him. He sang a line and then another because you cannot steal kindness from a room without offering something back. The pigeons edited the sky into sense, the library warmed, the bakery flirted, and a heron held its post with a patience he needed to borrow. He put his hand on his ribs like a man about to swear and then decided he did not have to decide what to swear on. The ring held its temperature like a secret it had no intention of gossiping about. The water made its endless spelling lesson, and he stopped pretending he didn’t know his letters. He breathed like wind through a flag, like a man who has agreed to be carried only as much as he is willing to row, like a student who has decided to be boring in a useful way, and the day, having waited for him to make up his mind, obliged him by continuing.Spring kept getting held up at the door by April’s bouncer and then slipping in anyway with a grin that made everyone forgive it. The river put away its theatrics and began the work of being dangerous in quiet ways, and posters with Keith’s name, or a version of his name that had mislaid a vowel, appeared in windows like friendly accusations. Dani taped one to the record shop’s glass with a flourish and wrote in sharpie beneath it not a star, a lamp; bring your own moth and then glared at anyone who called it cute. Ms. Wednesday announced a chain of living rooms that would accept him as if she were assigning him a pilgrimage route, and the pug had acquired a new sweater with a pirate embroidered over its heart, which the dog took as slander and attempted to bite. Ruth sent a text with dates and a blessing disguised as a scolding, and Ken wrote an email with questions about merchandise that made Keith feel briefly like a man organizing a very small nation with a very serious flag. The ring stayed on his thumb most days and on the saucer some nights, and he learned he could be superstitious without getting in his own way as long as he named the superstition out loud in the kitchen like a confession with buttered toast. He set two alarms for the EP release weekend not because he distrusted himself but because it felt good to be able to show up twice for the same event. He looked across the place where the Monroe Bridge nursed its shadow and told the water he was not asking for luck, just steadiness, and the water, which refused all assignments, performed steadiness next to a whirlpool just to be contrary.

Greta recruited him to hold a microphone and not speak for once while she gave a small lecture to people wearing raincoats with strong opinions about zippers. They stood on the bank near the bend that had less melodramatic names than Devil’s Elbow but that still knew how to tell a log it didn’t belong here. “Rivers are verbs,” she said, not knowing she was quoting a conversation he’d had with Dani, and she made a gesture with her hand like smoothing a skirt and daring it to wrinkle again. Keith watched faces hold onto vocabulary as if it could substitute for oars, and when Greta stepped aside and nodded at him as if she trusted him with her classroom, he sang two verses of a work song with no words but the ones breath makes when it stops pretending and does its job. A man in a cap clapped once and then looked at his own hands as if they had done something dangerous, and a child asked if the river was listening and Greta said yes and no and yes again, and Keith loved her for refusing a tidy answer that would make the child lazy. He helped pull a branch that had thought itself a continent out of a culvert’s mouth and he felt the ring scrape wood, and he did not make a poem out of it because he had already made enough for the day. Rain arrived in a polite, wet stippling and left the way decent guests leave a porch. On the way home he bought a sour cherry tart and decided to let it be a friend and not a reward, because rewards teach you to perform goodness and friends teach you to expect it.

Lila’s kiln cooled like a lion remembering it didn’t have to prove anything, and she opened it with the solemn hurry of a woman dating a miracle. The shelves produced bowls that had learned to shine without showing off, mugs that had given up trying to be famous and decided instead to be held. Keith reached for a cup too soon and snatched his hand back, swearing in the language Ingrid had gifted him, and Lila put his fingers in a bowl of water and told him gently that timing is evidence of attention, and attention is love, and love ought to be practiced on hot objects before you try it on people. He gave Alma the spoon bracelet on a Sunday so bright it made the house think about clean windows, and she slid it up over the soft geography of her wrist as if she had always been planning to make that journey. “Hjalmar wore a bracelet like this for a week when he was trying to be modern,” she said, inventing or remembering with all the authority of a woman cooking steel into soup. “Elsie laughed him out of it and then wore it herself until it bit her and she threw it at a goose. I’m not throwing this at any bird. Maybe at a man who interrupts a woman talking,” and then she looked at him with affection so sharp it cut only what needed cutting. He washed her dishes while she told him a version of the story where the ring had been used to bribe a weather system, and in that version the weather took the ring and then gave it back two years later in the belly of a different fish, and he decided that truth and taste and algae would always be a family.

The teenagers’ ramp rose behind the skatepark like a sentence being diagrammed by kids who refused to diagram anything, and he wandered by carrying the kind of coffee adults carry when they want to be useful and have no clue yet how. The girl lifted her chin at him in acknowledgment and annoyance, and the boys measured with their sneakers and argued in a math that would get them hurt and then wise. “We want it bigger,” one said, showing off his lack of blood without meaning to. “You want it better,” the girl corrected, and handed Keith a drill with a generosity that expected competence. He held wood and did not advise because nothing makes a ramp insult you faster than unsolicited metaphor. When it collapsed, because all new things do, they fell well and laughed the way people do when they survive their bravado, and he clapped once in his pocket where no one could hear and then handed over screws as if he had been born in a hardware store. “Don’t make it safe by fear,” he said, unable to stop his teacher voice. “Make it safe by respect.” The girl considered that in the same way she considered velocity, an ally only when asked properly. “Same,” she said, squinting at a seam. “We learned about weight distribution again. Your songs probably do too.” He wanted to hug carpentry, or maybe language, and he settled for holding a beam steady while a boy he would never get to name took the risk he needed to.

The man with the lamp sighed in his shop when Keith leaned on the counter as if leaning were a purchase. Behind him, a fan dialed its own weather between two displays of glass animals that were not whimsical enough to annoy. “Looking for rings that have forgot themselves?” the man asked, and Keith laughed and said he had more ring than sense already. “Good,” the man said without looking up from a watch he had taken apart because he could, and he gestured with a screwdriver at a red bowl. “Brought in two more bottle caps that think they are medals. No rings. One chain with a clasp that will lie to you until it breaks. A box of Polaroids where no one ever looked at the camera on purpose.” Keith bought a Polaroid of a girl on a lawn chair with a ribbon in her hair that had a voice and a bottle opener shaped like a trout, because sometimes you buy a metaphor and a tool and do not ask them to be friends. As he paid, the man said, almost bored, “You ever consider engraving your own initials inside your ring? Make the argument about ownership more complicated.” Keith shook his head and said the letters liked being stubborn. “Good,” the man said again. “Objects need defiance the way people need politeness. Balance keeps the dust off.”

EP night made the lobby fuller than it liked to be and happier than most rooms admit. Ruth wore black like she was trying not to spook the microphones, and Ken hovered with the air of a man trying to learn how not to hover. The Larches opened with Bridges Are Useful and proved their thesis, and Dani made a speech about handrails and appetites that got more gratitude than heckling, which disappointed her and delighted everyone else. Alma arrived with a hat that refused to apologize and a look that warned him not to make a fuss over her, which of course he did, gently, exactly enough. Greta sat near the back with a friend who had arms like oars and told him with her eyebrows that she had opinions on his set list that she would deliver later at a volume appropriate to epilogues. His father came in late, pretended to be invisible, and then cleared his throat loudly enough to register as a prayer when he saw the arrangement of cables on the floor and realized his son had learned to step around tangles. The chandelier performed its usual trick of making everyone think about weather systems and then forgot itself and simply shone. He took the stage by walking into it as if he were not entering a space altered by attention. The ring was cool on his thumb; the microphone pretended to be sleepy; his ribs were where he had left them.

He didn’t tell stories, not the way he had been telling them to prove he could, not the way he wanted to when he got nervous and thought he had to earn the right to sing by making people laugh. He did the folk song that sneaks and a new one that had decided not to be a sonnet and the river-not-forgiving line like it was a small knife handed handle-first. On the third song he took the ring off and put it on the piano because he wanted to feel whether he could carry himself without jewelry, and the answer, thank whoever manages answers, was yes. Somewhere in the second verse his father made the sound a man makes when he realizes his son might not need instruction he had been saving since 1989 and that this did not diminish him at all. Somewhere in the fourth, Ms. Wednesday’s pug sneezed with such evangelical commitment that half the room crossed themselves involuntarily and laughed, and Keith let the laughter lift him through the bridge without turning it into a raft. Ruth’s hand rode a silent fader with the grace of someone who had brought her own river and didn’t need to prove it. He finished and the applause moved through the room like a weather front that liked roofs and privacy and took only what it needed.

After, in the gold-and-marble afterlife where people touch each other’s elbows and ask for vinyl and try to make their faces as clear as their appreciation, he got told a dozen pieces of news about other people’s marriages to work and a handful of confessions about regrets his songs had hired as consultants. Dani made off with a stack of records and returned with cash smelling like the bakery and shame in equal portions. Ken said words about shipping and downloads that did not belong in a cathedral and then caught himself and apologized to the chandelier out loud, which made Ruth forgive him a month’s worth. Greta kissed his cheek and said, “Good. Don’t help too much,” and he nodded like a student who had gotten something right by accident. He looked for Alma and found only her hat, and the hat waved as if a woman under it had been called by a kitchen that did not like to be alone. His father put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed with the precise pressure of a man who knows bolts and did not stay long enough to make it awkward. He put the ring back on and did not feel any surge of anything except relief that the ring did not require ceremony to do its job.

He went to the river because he always did after a room had asked him to be larger than his apartment. The water shrugged the moon off like a shawl it was tired of, and the bridge held everything like a patient teacher. He said nothing important and nothing trivial, and that felt like a balance he could get used to. He woke the next day to a message from the ship that sounded like a table set by a woman who had not slept and wasn’t asking you to read into it. Maren said a passenger had done a thing with a drink and gravity and gotten away with it; she had sung under weird, generous lights and not apologized; she had slept six hours in a row and was arrogant about it; she had cried once at a coil of rope that had learned its own name. “What’s Spokane like when your record is a thing and not a dream,” she asked, casual as a recipe. He thought about sending her pictures of the palm’s new spear and the ribbon under the rug and the spoon bracelet, and instead he wrote a sentence about the lobby’s echo and how it behaved like a grandmother with boundaries and casseroles and sent her a photograph of the teenagers’ ramp at the moment before collapse, which was the most honest thing he could imagine.

He got asked to teach a workshop with a title he didn’t agree with—Finding Your Voice—which made him think of treasure hunts designed by camp counselors with too much optimism. He wanted to call it Look, It’s Your Throat, Do Less, but Ms. Morales at the community center said the flyer had already been printed and would he please not start a fight with marketing. Ten people came, which is too many for a living room and too few for a revolution. He put them on the floor with books, he asked them to sing vowels while feeling ridiculous, he corrected posture like an uncle who had read one issue of a medical journal and gotten ideas, and he said “It’s not high, it’s far” like a man quoting scripture to believers who had been trained otherwise. A man with shoulders that apologized sang his own name and started weeping without noise, and Keith remembered the thin ponytail and the fists and made the room safe by acting like nothing had broken. A woman whose mother had told her she should sing like she was making a bed stopped tucking in her notes and let them breathe like dogs. He watched himself use Maren’s phrases and not cheapen them and felt like a thief paying restitution with competence. He got paid in checks and bagels and a story from a girl who said she had been told once to choose a small voice in the interest of modesty and had chosen wrong. He put the ring in his pocket for the length of the workshop and touched it only once when his own throat tried to fold, and he said to the part of himself that wanted permission: you have it, go.

Skate jam day arrived like a minor holiday invented by a neighborhood that had decided to be good at inventing things. The teenagers painted a banner that said Rampionship in letters that looked like they had been cut out of sky. Someone brought a speaker that suffered and survived, and someone else grilled vegetables with a seriousness that made children stoic. He played a set at the edge, not pretty, with a cable taped down like a snake that had agreed to a contract, and he watched the way air moved differently around flying bodies. The girl with the ribbon smile fell hard, got up, put a hand on the ramp as if saying sorry to wood were the same as saying sorry to knees, and then landed the thing she’d been courting like a dare. She came over afterward and said, “You sang it better,” without specifying what it was, and he accepted both the praise and the accusation folded inside it. A boy offered him five dollars to borrow the ring because he had to roll a dice with his own courage, and Keith said no gently and then put the ring in his mouth for a second and blew across it like a bad harmonica and handed the kid his guitar pick instead. “It’s lucky,” he lied, and the boy grinned like a thief who had been caught and forgiven at once.

Greta found a man with a boat slow enough to teach and took Keith out on a stretch of water that did not require audience or apology. The oars felt heavier than metaphor and easier than fear. “Feather,” she said, and he did, tasting the difference between arrogant splash and competent return. He held the ring between his molars once when a gust insisted on making decisions for him, and he tasted not courage so much as commitment flavored with iron, and he grinned at himself and at the water and let the gust have a small victory rather than capsizing his day. “Good,” Greta said. “Your insistence is learning to kneel.” He wanted to write that down and didn’t because he was holding both an oar and his own dignity and he did not trust either to balance on paper mid-current. Back on land he carried the boat with his thighs complaining and his shoulders honest, and he said thank you to wood and rope and woman like a person who had finally learned the shape of the word.

Alma gave him a notebook with three recipes written in a hand that assumed flour and patience and a margin decorated with comments from a woman who had never let the recipe have the last word. “Make the soup when your father comes and don’t tell him it’s good for him until after,” she wrote, and he obeyed like a son who had decided to try out the role of obedient in his thirties and found it fit surprisingly well. He made the soup and his father ate it with a skepticism that lost its footing and then called it acceptable with a noise that meant excellent, and Keith felt like a cook in a household where compliments always wore disguises. He took the leftovers to Lila who added lemon at the table and taught him that finishing a dish is as important as starting it, and he wrote finish in his notebook next to breathe. He found himself wanting to write to June about everything he refused to tell adults for fear of breaking the spell of being competent. He drew her a map of the river with landmarks like Pigeon Parliament and Bakery Rumor and Heron Who Is Secretly My Boss, and he wrote on the back instructions for making a paper boat that would not sink if you spoke to it like it was learning, and he mailed it with a stamp chosen for its colors, not for its commemorations.

One night, the city offered him an unremarkable darkness and he took it, sat in the studio with the lamp’s linen shade poor at keeping secrets, and did nothing extraordinary for an hour. Lila came in with a ribbon for her hair and a stain on her apron that looked like a continent reclaiming boundaries. “I’m holding a sale,” she announced. “You will sing at it or else people will buy nothing and blame the clay.” He sang at the sale and watched a woman choose a bowl the way people choose dogs at the shelter, with a mixture of cruelty and hope that somehow adds up to kindness. He took home a cup that looked like it would teach him how to drink and not forget he had, and he used it to make tea so good it made him suspicious of himself.

A storm that did not care about calendars bullied its way in late one afternoon and turned the river into an argument that screamed. The encampment under the overpass had to move whether it wanted to or not, and he went with Greta and half of Riverkeepers and two people who preferred not to say their names. They lifted and spoke and did not narrate, and he learned the exact weight of a wet mattress and the exact sound a man makes when he chooses to carry his own backpack for once and the exact way to say, “We’re going to set you down over there,” without making it into a sermon. He sang nothing. He did what he had promised the ring he would do on nights like that: he offered back muscle to water and did not ask for applause. When it was over, a woman who had survived fourteen bad decisions in a row asked him if he had a song for the feeling you get when you realize you’ve lived through all the ones you thought would kill you, and he said he did and then did not sing it because he did not have the right to sing it then. He wrote it later and let it be ugly first and then honest and then something else, and Dani told him not to make it nice, and he promised he wouldn’t.

Ms. Wednesday held a May party that involved a punch bowl the size of a bass drum and a dispute with a neighbor about the nature of joy. The velvet hats were back in force; one was worn by a man whose jaw had made poor choices and survived and who played harmonica like he was apologizing for stealing a train and not sorry enough. Keith sang two songs with him and felt his lungs make a treaty with a metal reed, and he put his ring on his index finger for one verse just to confuse his own sense of balance. In the kitchen, Ingrid told him a Swedish word for the thing that happens when you stand up too fast and the world goes to the edge and back, and he decided to steal it for a chorus one day and not pay royalties. He went home smelling like orange peel and fire, and the apartment made the page-turning noise again, and he said to no one, Stay, in a tone that had nothing to do with furniture and everything to do with choosing.

A test pressing arrived in a cardboard sleeve that made a weak case for its own importance, and he put it on Dani’s shop turntable because sacred things are best experienced in secular places. The needle lowered like a priest with good comic timing and then the room reached the temperature where his voice sounded like his. He hated one s and two breaths and a guitar squeak he had made on purpose and Ruth had let live, and he loved the way the bass turned the air into a thing that could hold him up briefly without asking him to explain. Dani leaned her head into it like a woman at a thunderstorm she had ordered and said, “This will make three people call me and say you told the truth for once,” and he did not ask her which three because the number felt like luck and you do not make luck explain itself.

A small envelope with Ruth’s handwriting appeared at the studio with no fanfare. Inside was a ribbon almost too short to tie anything, frayed at one end like a good argument, and a note that said in a script that could have testified in court, Sing past her. He tied the ribbon around the ring for an hour and then realized he might be inventing both magic and inconvenience and put the ribbon in his guitar case where his picks and his instructions lived. Another envelope came at the same time to Alma with a clipping Greta had found about a woman fined for swearing at a ship’s inspector in two languages, and Alma called him to read it out loud with relish and then hung up before he could tell her she had made his day because she did not need credit, she needed soup, which he delivered later with too much black pepper and a loaf of bread with a crust that could injure.

He met his father in a parking lot that had various opinions about cars and caught himself thinking of calling a truce between a man and a cholesterol count as if one could be negotiated into attending fewer parties. They went inside a store that sold things shaped like gadgets for lives that admitted maintenance, and his father asked questions about walking shoes with a humility that made Keith step back and be quiet. They stood over socks like two men deciding between river crossings, and they chose a pair called cushion with a seriousness that would shame a Senate committee. His father said, “I heard you on that community radio between mushrooms and somebody’s fiddling,” and Keith said, “They put me right where I belong,” and his father made a small noise of possession that had the spine of a hug and the discretion of a nod.

The EP release gave way to the practicalities of nothing stopping. He played the winter festival’s spring adjunct in a tent that thought it was a cathedral and then in a pub where the ceiling leaked an opinion about compromise. He taught a lesson in the studio on a day when Lila’s glaze crawled and refused and learned, and he learned a new patience from a substance that became beautiful by letting go of wanting to be. He mailed three records to people who had written to him in handwriting that made him want to improve his own, and he sent one to the ship care of the agent with a note that said do not throw at the ocean. June responded with a voicemail that was mostly wind and then “we are not allowed to say swears at jellyfish but we do in our heads,” which he treasured more than he would admit.

He thought, one morning while the pigeons gathered as if assembling a quorum, about the ring’s letters again. E.N. was Elsie one day and Enough Now the next and Every Night when sleep got mean and let him in only after negotiations. He said them all quietly to his thumb, because ridiculous ritual had taught him he could hold several meanings the way a hand holds several coins and spends the right one at the right counter. He stopped asking the water to confirm and started asking it to witness, and that made even the grocery store feel like a room with resonant walls. In a moment of moral weakness he almost texted Maren a sentence with a declaration pinned harmlessly to the end of it, and he deleted it and sent instead a picture of the teenagers’ ramp rebuilt with a bracket Dani had designed in the shop between customers, and he wrote under it architecture is a team sport, and her answer came back along the spine of the day: singing too. He breathed easier because her sentence did not make anything worse.

He wrote on a folded card and slid it under the rug again, not because he wanted anyone to find it or because he wanted to read it later and praise his own restraint, but because the act of tucking advice into a room felt like baptizing the floorboards. This time he wrote, Row first, then look up. You will not miss the horizon by being useful. He left the studio and locked it with the key tied to the sage ribbon and felt for a second like a man littering a city with honest notes. He thought about telling Dani or Lila and decided the first rule of secret shrines is you don’t tell your friends unless you want them to tease you into becoming insufferable, and he had promised himself not to become a bore.

A week when nothing dramatic happened stretched like dough and rose anyway. He woke before his alarm and with no noble purpose made coffee and put toast in his mouth and forgot it was there and laughed at himself when he realized he had been chewing on ideas like they were crusts. He went to the river and did not sing and then sang and then did not again and let none of those choices count as a mistake. He walked past the mural of the lunch counter saint and saluted without irony. He stood on the bridge and did the math of days, which is to say he refused math and trusted accumulation to do what arithmetic couldn’t. He looked at his hand and the ring on it and thought about the day he would slip it off for someone else to hold permanently and did not panic at the thought, which felt like the kind of courage no one would write a song about and therefore the kind he wanted to practice.

He did not name it hope, because hope has edges he sometimes cut himself on, but he let a picture form of Maren in a doorway with her hand on a jamb and a suitcase in the other, and he practiced the sentences he would say that did not ask for anything or offer anything he could not give. He watched the water make its long, unembarrassed statements and decided to be boring in useful ways again today and again tomorrow and again until the day refused to notice he was trying. The train instructed the dark where to go and the dark negotiated and he smiled because even elements argued with affection. He put his hands in his pockets and let the quarters be planets and the ring be a moon and his ribs be a lake and his throat be a flag and his feet be oars, and he walked back into a city that had started to believe in his consistency without turning it into a monument. He did not narrate his effort as he crossed, and the day, appreciative of the silence, kept going.
