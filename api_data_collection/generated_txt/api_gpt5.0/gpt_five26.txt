The night Bogotá refused to sleep, the mountain wore a belt of lightning and the cobbles in La Candelaria sweated, as if the city were a living thing with a fever. Street dogs skittered between the yellow cones of light, buskers played a broken cumbia that found its way onto terrace after terrace, and the smell of arepas mixed with rain, diesel, old paper, guava. People said the thunder was the volcanoes arguing, that sometimes the Andes had voices, and that on those nights the gods listened.

Princess Luzia walked with her hood up and her hands bare against the rain, fingers tracing every wet seam of the wall beside her as though the city’s bricks were a script. She had learned to read Bogotá like that. Whoever called her princess did it with a smile or with teeth: her family had lost their flag three generations ago, a crown kept in a bank vault and paraded on bulletproof glass only for foreign journalists who wanted a legend. But the title clung. She was the last daughter of the Laches line, polls said she had no country, and yet, in the height-thin air, her name filled rooms, made certain criminals fold their hands and certain cops look at their boots like they’d scuffed the map.

The woman running beside her wheezed. Jimena, whose bracelets had letters and whose letters had teeth. “You walk too fast, Luz.”

“We’re late,” Luzia said. “Listen to the rain. It’s changing.”

“Rain doesn’t change.”

“It does when it brings news.”

A bus shrieked to a halt near them and belched blue fog. Luzia waited for the hiss to die before they crossed, her eyes flicking to angles where men waited with umbrellas, to the glint of a watch face in a shuttered restaurante, to the flaking sticker of a political party that no longer existed. Her particular talent had never been advertised. It was easier to say she spoke seven languages than to say she could track a rumor through a market like a hawk tracks warm air, or that she could hear a lie vibrate on the teeth of a radio. She made maps of things that didn’t want to be mapped: the routes laughter took through the barrios, the customs declarations no one wrote, the way the city hid what it loved. It made her terrible to face in a ballroom, and useful when the world forgot a child’s name.

Jimena, swatting raindrops out of her eyelashes, said, “I still say we could’ve done this in daylight.”

“The person who sent the message asked for midnight. People ask for midnight when they’re afraid of the day.”

“What about your Council?” Jimena said. “Won’t they be angry if you keep doing this?”

“The Council of Rain gets angry about everything,” Luzia said, and felt a smile rise because the name was Jimena’s invention for the white-haired men who sent Luzia to charity breakfasts and told her to marry a banker. “They’re probably asleep. Or pretending to be awake so they can tell their wives I was difficult.”

They slipped into the alley behind the salt-store, the one with the paint of a saint flaking from its door. It smelled like old minerals, like money under beds. There, in the breathing dark, sat Taita Esteban, her mother’s guardsman, who had worn the same leather jacket since before Luzia’s first tooth and had the softest hands in the world when he helped her tie her shoes. The jacket beaded with rain. The old man’s cap was pulled low, and he had his radio turned to the useless station that played only birdcalls.

He looked up. His eyes, in the alley’s thin light, were flint. “Your friend is inside,” he said. “She came early. She came too early.”

“Which friend?” Luzia felt the shiver of the thunder’s drum in her ribs, and then the way the city held its breath, ready for the next strike. Her feet were already moving, up the stairs with the jagged edge, the stairs that snagged stockings and patience, and into the dim shop where salt shelves were the aisles of an empty church.

And there, by the cracked counter, was Yara, who hacked files as if they were seaweed and threaded them through her hair. She had a smile like a busted lightbulb and wore a coat entirely too light for a night like this, pink and brave, and her nails were painted with the retro logos of defunct airlines. Her eyes were not on Luzia. They were on the paper bag between them, on the damp greasy rectangle it contained.

“I almost ate it,” Yara said. “But my grandmother would rise out of her grave and slap me with a cassava if I ate something that wasn’t for me.”

Luzia’s mouth went dry. “Who delivered it?”

“Boy on a bicycle. Had a hat too big for him, like he stole it off a grown-up. Wouldn’t look at me. Said it was for the princess. Wouldn’t say which princess. You should talk to your PR. I told him there were too many of you and an insufficient number of dragons.”

Jimena squeezed Yara’s arm and leaned over the bag as if it might bite them. “It’s one of those bombs, isn’t it? The ones the anarchists in the north like to put in shoes?”

Luzia shook her head. She picked up the bag with both hands as if it were a newborn. It was heavy, and it pulsed cold through the paper. She could feel the faintest tremor, like a breath. Through the seam of the bag drifted a smell that made her think of riverbeds after drought, of the holy water founts no one used, of a clinic waiting room when the air conditioner died. And under that, a sweetness, rancid as the bottom of a fruit bowl forgotten under a bed.

“Careful,” Taita Esteban said softly behind them. He had not come inside, but his voice could fill a room without raising a single decibel. “Words come in bags, sometimes.”

Luzia undid the knot. Inside lay an envelope protected by waxed paper, and inside the envelope a sheet of notebook paper, cheap, the lines pale blue, and the writing was a list of names. Thirty-two names, each a common little universe: Isaías. Camila, Sofi, Ángel, Yasmira. The final name had a star drawn next to it, as if a teacher had corrected the word. Next to the star: L—Uz—. The letters smeared. It could be a joke. It could be a warning. It could be a practiced cruelty.

Yara said, “Oh, no. No no no. It’s another harvest.”

Jimena crossed herself the way her grandmother had taught her, fingers clumsy and swift. “How many of these lists have there been?”

“Six in two months,” Yara said. “Nine if you count the fakes. The first one came to a bakery in Suba. It came folded into a sugar bag. People thought it was a prank, and then—” She swallowed like she was swallowing a storm. “I don’t need to say.”

“I know,” Luzia said. She knew too much. She carried those names folded into her own bones. The city gave them to her one by one, ghost by ghost, and some days she felt like she was made not of cartilage and muscle but of finally sharpened paper. She handed the list to Jimena, but not before she had taken the smell of the paper into her nose, let it sit on her tongue like a wine. There was a trace of anise. Of something metallic. Ink, cheap. The letter e in the second line was written differently, an open loop, then later closed. A borrowed hand? A shaking hand? The letters had not been written where they lay. They had been written in transit. In a bus, maybe. In a bus where the driver played vallenatos so loud the o’s bloomed too big.

She turned the paper over. On the back was an address written in pencil and then erased, and then written again, in the same hand but with a different pressure. S—alt—C—thed—l, it said as if the hand itself didn’t trust the vowels. She thought of the cathedral cut into the belly of Zipaquirá, its tunnels like ribs, its saints made of salt, its idea of refuge. She thought of the old story that under the cathedral the Muisca had left a door that opens only when you speak a name not your own.

Taita said, “I don’t like this.”

“I like it even less,” Jimena said. “We can call. We can call the police.”

“They will come in uniforms and with cameras,” Yara said. “They will come late. They will say it was the wind.”

Luzia folded the paper again, and the city settled on her shoulders like a shawl she had outgrown. “We go. Now. Before the morning commuters come. Before the buses bring gossip to the mountain.”

“You always say that,” Jimena said quietly. “Before the buses bring gossip to the mountain. What if the mountain listens anyway?”

Luzia tucked the note into the inner pocket of her jacket and let the paper warm against her heart. “Mountains listen,” she said. “But they aren’t always on the side of the people who talk loudest.”

They drove through a city that pretended, for two hours after midnight, to be someone else. The graffito eyes closed on the walls. The billboards changed their sentences mid-sentence, as if embarrassed to be observed naked by a princess’s car. Luzia drove because she liked the way the road talked to her hands, and because her particular set of skills included the uncomfortable ability to know when to brake before a child could step off a curb she had not yet reached. She did not tell anyone about that, not even Taita Esteban. He had his own kind of knowledge, the old soldier’s kind, where the body remembers which doorframes are narrower, which streetlights hum when their bulbs are dying, which stores will give a girl a glass of water even if she cannot pay.

In the passenger seat, Jimena slept, her mouth open, the shape of a laugh at the corner. Yara animated a map on the screen with her fingers, lines and dots blooming like algae. Taita hummed, something like a lullaby and like a war march. The two things often sounded the same.

“Do you trust me?” Luzia asked, eyes on the road, as the highway to Zipaquirá opened like a throat. The rain pelted harder and then softer, and the headlights of a lonely truck coming too fast blinked a code that said: hurry or slow or beware or god speed.

“Is that a trick question?” Yara said.

“Yes,” Luzia said. “I want to hear you say yes when you know that I am wrong and will go anyway.”

“Yes, mi reina. I trust you. I will still tell you when you are wrong. I like to fight with you.”

“That’s why you’re my friend.” Luzia’s hands were steady. The mountain was a bruise against the sky. And then, because she could not carry silence another meter, she said, “Have you heard the name? The one nobody wants to say out loud these days. The one the station doesn’t play even as gossip.”

Yara said nothing. Jimena woke, mid-word, a gasped syllable that had once belonged in a dream. Taita, from the back seat, said in a voice flat as a road: “Malena.”

The name flickered like a match that wouldn’t quite catch. Yara snorted. “You can’t be serious. That one. The rumor with shoes. The breath that stinks up the ballroom.”

“You were there when she came to the city,” Taita said. “Eight months ago. The gala.”

“I don’t go to galas,” Yara said. “I go to holes in the wall with beer. But I read the men with ties when they break out of their cages and write cretinous columns. They called her the Princess of the Sulfur Isles, which is funny because those islands don’t exist. They said she smelled of… of—”

“Rot,” Jimena said, too quickly, as if she wanted to cut the word in half. “They said the air soured when she passed. Men like to invent smells for women they can’t forgive for being in the room.”

“She is real,” Taita said. “She was presented to the white-haired ones as if she were a jewel. They tested the weight of her name in their mouths. She danced very slowly with the men who deserve no daughters. And her chest did not move as if with breath. I watched.”

“You always watch,” Luzia said. “What else?”

“Her bottom” — he said it in a voice that turned the word into a blade — “her backside left a dampness where she sat. A stain on the silk. It smelled sour. You asked. I answer. The women who changed the linens tightened their smiles like corsets and said it was her perfume. It was not.”

“That is so specific,” Jimena said, partly horrified and partly delighted in the way girls get when they want to be braver than their mothers.

“It was so specific to them,” Taita said. His voice softened. “There are curses people carry without deserving them. There are also weapons that pretend to be curses. I tell you what I saw. I tell you because we have arrived at the time when each detail may matter.”

The Salt Cathedral rose, then sank, then rose again as the road turned. The sun was not up. The night smelled less like Bogotá now, more like wet stone, like eucalyptus leaves shocked open by rain. They parked where the signs told them not to, because the guards who would normally enforce the signs had taken a nap behind the glass.

Yara tugged her scarf over her ears. “If we get arrested for breaking into a church, I want you to know I’m going to tell my mother it was your idea.”

“It was my idea,” Luzia said.

A boy with a hat too large for him stood at the base of the ramp leading down. He had a bike with a bent wheel and a face someone had taught to be blank. He watched them with that total attention children reserve for cats and for danger.

Luzia squatted so their eyes were level. “It was you, wasn’t it?”

He looked past her left ear. “I have two sisters.”

“What are their names?”

He shook his head.

“You don’t tell your name to strangers,” Taita said. “That is smart.”

“Do you want some money?” Jimena asked, because she had money for once, because she had been paid by a gallery to buy shoes and talk about them into a camera.

“No,” the boy said. “No money. She said no money.”

“Who said?”

He closed his eyes and said the shape of the word without sound. Malena, it looked like. Or Mamá. His hat slipped, and rain got in. When he opened his eyes again, there were tears there not because he was sad but because the mountain wind is a cruel friend.

“She told me to bring it to the princess,” he said. “She said if I did it, my sisters would be invisible. I don’t want them to be invisible.”

“They won’t be,” Luzia said. “They’ll be fluorescent. They’ll be a lighthouse. They will be so visible that people will close their eyes and see them on their eyelids.”

“What if you’re lying?”

She smiled with all the teeth of her house. “Then you will bring a flame to my door and I will stand and let you burn me.”

He looked at her as if he wanted to believe and had been told often that wanting was a foolish hobby. Then he ran, the slash of the bike frame a darker dark in the rain.

They descended. The Salt Cathedral’s entrance always smells like coins to Luzia, that metallic promise, and like something older than promise, something like a throat clearing before a song. There was no one at the ticket counter. No one at the turnstile. It made the entire mountain feel as if it had been waiting for her.

“Don’t say that thing about the door,” Jimena whispered as they walked past the carved Stations of the Cross, past the tourists’ silence. “The thing where you speak a name not your own.”

“What if it’s true?” Yara said. “Don’t bump me. I’m counting.”

Counting what? Steps. Breaths. There were several ways to tell if someone had tampered with a place. One of Yara’s favorites was the number of steps it took to reach an altar. This tunnel, on most days, had never been able to keep its count straight. Today it was very clearly wrong. Luzia could feel the wrongness in her ankle bones, in her tongue.

They found the first paper on the fourth cross, taped below the words PERDÓN. The tape was the kind kids use for school projects, the edges ragged. On the paper: the letter L, huge, as if signed by a child proud of the initial, and beneath it, a tracer of perfume that wasn’t perfume, a scent sorry to be born, that made Yara gag and Jimena jerk her scarf up to her nose.

They found the second paper on the fifth cross, INJUSTICIA, and the letter U, and she would have laughed if the smell hadn’t slid like oil into her lungs.

“L-U-Z-i-a,” Jimena said. “I don’t like this game.”

On the eighth cross the letter Z, on the ninth, the letter I — the dot drawn as a heart, though the heart had three points like a sick flower — and then on the tenth cross, a long horizontal line and underneath it "a" and then three dots. The line went on and on as if the hand that wrote it had refused to lift at all.

Yara said, “She’s spelling your name. She’s taking your breath apart one letter at a time. She thinks she’s clever.”

“She is clever,” Taita murmured. “I feel that it is colder here than it should be.”

Luzia touched the stone walls. Salt crystals caught the light of their small lamp and threw it back in broken stars. The mountain hummed. The list in her pocket warmed and cooled with her own breathing. Somewhere water dripped. Somewhere else a drop should have fallen and did not. She was not a priestess. She was not a warrior. She was a woman who could follow a rumor to the place where it slept and wake it up. She closed her eyes, breathed in the sour-sweet.

“Where are you?” she said to the dark, softly, the way you ask a cat to come down from a shelf. “Where did you enter? What name did you borrow?”

The answer was a draft that sneaked from below. From the place where the catacombs extended beyond the public, down to where they had carved churches for miners’ saints. Taita touched her arm and said, “No.”

She said, “Yes.”

He sighed, the way you sigh when you watch a child climb a tree she will fall from and learn to climb anyway.

Down they went, off the path and into the sighing heart of salt. Luzia felt the weight of the Andes above her, felt it like a hand pressing down. No one else had come into this part of the mountain in months, maybe years. Their lamp bent shadows. Twice, ropes of salt hanging like stalactites took the shapes of the girls whose names Luzia carried in her blood. Twice, the dark stank of something that had been waiting too long inside an animal. The third time they turned a corner they found the first of the marks worked directly into the wall.

The smear was human height, about where a person would lean their back if they were tired and hadn’t learned this place had no patience for bodies. It was a bloom, like fungus, like a wet silence. It smelled like a trash chute on a boat, like the air the day after a parade when everything left on the street grows its own teeth. It made Jimena gag again and then laugh, scared, and then swear in a roll of words her grandmother would not recognize. Yara took a photo and then deleted it. Taita took off his cap and stood with it in his hands, as if this were a funeral.

“She wanted you to see it,” Yara said. “She wanted you to think of her body. She wanted you to think of your own.”

“Or she wanted to cover a door with a smell so strong no guard dog would put its nose to it,” Taita said.

Luzia flattened her palm against the stone beside the smear and felt the cold. It was not the cold of rocks. It was the cold of a room that has been empty too long. She put her ear to the stone and heard a sound like ants marching.

“She went through here,” she said. “She didn’t open a door, she melted it.”

“How do you melt salt?” Jimena asked. The rain came down somewhere far above and made a sound like thousands of wrappers being crumpled.

“With water,” Yara said. “With futility.”

“With patience,” Luzia said. She stepped back. “And with tears. If we had enough of them.”

“Don’t,” Taita said sharply. “Don’t even try the suggestion.”

She wasn’t. That was not her skill. Her skill was this: to step where the rumor had stepped, and to listen to the order in which it had scattered its crumbs. She closed her eyes and tried to become just ears and skin.

What she heard first was humming, yes — not the mountain now, but a woman’s mouth, wordless, like someone teaching herself to breathe past a pain. Then the rustle of thin paper. And under that, voices, many voices, each saying yes and no and no and yes, as children do when they get to the end of a story and aren’t sure which ending they liked best.

She put her hand to the smear again, this time not to feel cold but to feel what lingered. Anger. Loneliness. The sick thrill of making something big afraid. And something else. That something else shifted like a sleeper. A hunger that wanted to be fed until the world had no more to give. She thought of the dance floor at the gala where the Princess of the Sulfur Isles had moved like a slow knife. She had not been present. She had refused the invitation for reasons that had to do with how the Council of Rain liked to sell her pride. But she had seen the videos that leaked, an arm here, a glance there, a slow arching of a back that drew gasps not because of beauty but because the air changed when she did it, like a fever broke through silk.

“Let’s go,” she said. “We came too late for this marker. The message is old. Maybe weeks. The list is new. She is ahead.”

“And if she has your name?” Jimena said. Her eyes were very big. She laughed at herself. “My mother would decide now is the time to tell me where she hid my baptismal certificate.”

“If she has my name, she will play with it until the vowels fall asleep,” Luzia said. “She will try to make me an echo. I have been an echo before, but not for long.”

Taita put his cap back on. “We leave. We come back with light and with a priest and with something to bind the door.”

On the way back up, the salt saints faced away from them. The letters of Luzia’s name had curled in the damp and loosened, the tape slick. Yara peeled up the Z and pocketed it. “For science,” she said. “For my altar of things I don’t understand.”

At the entrance, dawn bruised the horizon, smearing lilac over the hills. The boy with the too-large hat was gone. In his place, tied to the railing with a ribbon that might once have been white, fluttered a handkerchief on which was written in a slanted schoolgirl script: Don’t be late again.

The handkerchief smelled like the smear in the tunnel and like jasmine. The two smells wrestled and neither won.

“We were late,” Jimena said. “She wanted us to be late. She has calendars we don’t.”

“She has our calendars,” Yara said darkly. “She hacked them. She knows exactly when Luzia meets with the men who smell like old wood.”

Taita scanned the parking lot. “We should leave. We are outside and I would like to remain this way.”

They drove back into a city already picking things out of its teeth. The buses rolled awake, the vendors’ thermoses steamed, the sky never quite decided on a color. As they crossed the invisible border where the city’s hum becomes a different song, Luzia’s phone began to pulse with a call she did not want to answer.

She answered. The voice on the other end was soft, measured, smelled of old money through the speaker: Don Mateo of the Council, who wore ties that had seen dictators and weddings and had exactly three kisses for Luzia on each cheek, never a real fourth.

“You’re up early,” he said. “Or late.”

“Neither,” Luzia said. “I am in the middle.”

“We have a guest,” he said. “She has requested an audience. She has requested you. We told her you would be indisposed for the month.”

“Who?”

He did not say the name. He did not need to. The way he breathed after the syllables that didn’t come was a language she had learned as a child: not fear, because men like him didn’t have the vocabulary, but a carefully curated reluctance to admit the sun rose without asking permission. “She has an invitation to the Ball of the Foundation. She has a smell like… like a factory at low tide. She has a seat where there is no seat for her.”

“Tell her I will meet her,” Luzia said. “Tell her I am very good at being on time.”

Don Mateo sighed, and it sounded like birds flying out of a field in fear. “Luzia. She is not a lady. She is not even a woman. She is something written in the wrong margins.”

“Then she is in the right city,” Luzia said, and hung up, because if she let him say another word she would use up all her softness before breakfast.

Yara said, “What are we going to do?”

“What we always do,” Luzia said. “We will make maps that lie less than other maps. We will cut through the alleys where the fog sticks. We will drink coffee until our hearts vibrate.”

“And if she asks you for a dance?”

“She will not ask,” Luzia said. “She will take. And I will follow her onto the floor and see where she has decided the cliff begins.”

They drove on. The city unfolded, imperfect, dangerous, theirs. Somewhere, a list of names lay on a kitchen table, next to a bowl of mangoes trying so hard not to rot. Somewhere, a woman who might not be a woman practiced a greeting with a mouth that had never used please or sorry. And Luzia, princess in a city that had no need of princes, set her shoulders, counted the breaths between stoplights, and went to war without declaring it out loud.

Late that morning the Council’s building reflected the sky in fractured squares. It had the sort of lobby that tried too hard to forget it had once been a bank. The guards wore suits but carried guns, and the coffee tasted like someone else’s idea of coffee. The secretary offered Luzia a smile that meant I would rather you were someone else and a glass of water that sweated. Luzia took both, because politeness was a blade as sharp as any.

“You kept us waiting,” Don Mateo said. He wore a tie the color of a bruise and a look like he had lost a chess piece.

“I went to church,” Luzia said.

“How very devout,” said a voice from the window.

She turned. The room smelled—as Taita had said—not of flowers exactly, but of something that had been flowers once and then had been left in a cupboard until they had their own opinions. Standing by the glass was the woman people called the Princess of the Sulfur Isles, though islands that made sulfur rarely welcomed royalty and rarely floated in any of the seas stamped on maps. She wore white, of course, because white dirties most beautifully, and the dress clung in the way you only get when the fabric has fallen in love with the body wearing it. Her hair, dark as an apology, fell unbraided. Her eyes were the kind people called blue because calling them poisonous would be impolite.

“Princess Luzia of Bogotá,” she said. “Finally.”

“I am not of Bogotá,” Luzia said. “I am Bogotá. One of its many organs.”

“How brave,” the other princess murmured. She walked across the carpet with a slowness that unthreaded time, and when she sat in the chair closest to Luzia she left, impossibly, a damp outline. The men in the room flinched without flinching. The secretary smiled wider, because what else do you do when you are paid to smile around gods and monsters?

Malena—she did not say her name, not yet, but the name said itself in the room, had the weight of a ring in a pocket—leaned in until Luzia could see a scar on her lip that had never fully learned its lines. “I have been looking forward to meeting you,” she said softly. “They say you can hear the city when it whispers to itself.”

“I can hear you,” Luzia said. “It is not whispering.”

“Do I offend?” The woman’s smile broke like a wave hitting a wall only once.

“You exist,” Luzia said. “Sometimes that is enough to offend.”

“How honest,” Malena said. She reached into her small bag—the bag was older than she was, older than everyone here, made of leather that remembered salt—and drew out a single folded handkerchief. It was white. It was clean. It smelled, faintly, of jasmine and something else, something like the air in a hospital corridor at three in the morning. She placed it on the table between them. “A token. There is ink on it that does not wash out. I was told you liked things that do not wash out.”

Don Mateo made a sound in his throat. The secretary, who had been pretending to alphabetize the pens, made the excellent decision to leave the room.

“Why are you here?” Luzia asked. Asked it like she was asking a cloud why it had chosen this patch of sky.

“Because I can be,” Malena said. “Because this city is a table where powers play cards with crumbs. Because your name is an interesting shape to write. And because—don’t be afraid now—because sometimes you do not arrive in time, and I like to see what you bring when you are late.”

Luzia did not glance at Taita. She did not run through the catalog of the names in her pocket. She held the handkerchief under her eyes without touching it. The threadwork was not from here. The letters embroidered tiny in one corner were not even letters she recognized. The slightest stain at the edge—barely a tea’s shadow—smelled of salt. Not salt like the Cathedral. Salt like the sea on a day that refuses swimmers.

“You’re going to ask me to choose,” Luzia said. “You’re going to build me a room with two doors and tell me only one is real.”

“I would never be so boring,” Malena said. She stood, and the air shifted. “No, princess. I am going to show you the floor where you dance—everyone loves to say you dance—has a crack you cannot see unless you look at it from below. I am going to widen the crack. And then, when I have made the room honest, we will begin.”

“Begin what?”

“Begin being ourselves,” Malena said, and the way she said that was like a promise you don’t want and a gift you can’t refuse. She moved past Luzia so close the smell of her rode the nerves on Luzia’s arms and left a wake that made Don Mateo cough into his sleeve. At the door, Malena paused and turned, and in the light the seam of her dress was a rip that had been mended quickly by someone who didn’t care to be neat. “Oh. And congratulations,” she said. “On missing the first bus. It will make missing the next one harder.”

She left. The scent lingered like a rude word at a wedding.

“You will not meet her again,” Don Mateo said. “You will go to your rooms and you will consider the optics. We will—”

“Tell me what she asked you for before I got here,” Luzia said to him without looking. “Tell me what you promised her because you liked the way her dress pretended to be clean.”

Don Mateo did not answer. He was not good at silence when someone else commanded it. The rain began again, this time in fists. Somewhere, a house with a tin roof lifted its shoulders to let the storm land.

Luzia picked up the handkerchief with two fingers as if it were a snake that had agreed to behave for a photograph. She slipped it into her pocket with the list. She stood up with her skin buzzing like it had been lightly electrified. She thought of the tunnel and the smear, of children’s names written in a hand that had never erased anything with regret, of boys with hats too big for their heads. She thought of the mountain listening, of the door that melted, of the word begin.

“Do not be late,” the handkerchief had said. She would be late. And she would be fast. And she would learn how to bring a room low without moving any chairs. The city scratched its back against the Andes and shook water out of its fur. She walked out of the Council’s house into a morning that had peaked and was already tipping toward afternoon, and Bogotá, faithful, treacherous, kept pace, the way a dog will walk close to a girl when it smells a rival king coming up the hill.By noon the rain had changed its mind and come back as mist, a finer knife, and Bogotá wore it like a veil she would never lift in public. Luzia walked fast because standing still made the worry climb her back with nails. Taita Esteban matched her pace without breathing hard, a habit of old soldiers and older uncles, and Jimena clattered beside them like a bracelet drawer thrown open, her earrings small bells that announced her temper. Yara had vanished for an hour and returned with her eyes full of screens and her hands full of empanadas that steamed like little arguments in waxed paper. They ate as they walked, because food tasted truer on the move and because sitting made the phone ring.

“She left you a handkerchief,” Jimena said around a mouthful. “Which is either romantic or insulting. Do you think it’s a challenge? It feels like a challenge. This whole city is a duel and the men in ties think the weapons are forks.”

“It’s a map,” Luzia said. She held the handkerchief inside her jacket pocket and let it cool against her ribs like a coin. “The thread isn’t ours. Someone made this with a needle to teach us something. The letters in the corner are not letters you can buy on a Christmas bauble in Unilago. They are… crooked. Wrong in a way that makes them right if you are from somewhere that never had its alphabet recognized.”

“You want a fabric witch,” Yara said. She wiped her fingers on her jeans as if they were steel. “I have three in my directory and one owes me a favor because I didn’t post her tax ID by accident while I was braining a mayor. She is in San Victorino on Thursdays until five and then she turns into a pumpkin and goes home to her grandchildren.”

“I know her,” Taita said, surprising them. “She sewed my wedding shirt with hands that had learned to thread needles while running from paramilitares. She will spit on your shoes if you ask the wrong question, so don’t.”

They cut through a block where the graffiti had been painted over by a beige so pure it made Luzia pry at the wall with her eyes to bring back the laughing saints beneath. The air smelled of fresh paint and damp cardboard, and in a doorway a woman sold socks that might or might not last a week. The market at San Victorino was a body with too many veins, and at this hour they were all pulsing. Vendors shouted the same words in different tongues, and the mannequins in camo lingerie looked like they knew secrets about wars that never made the news.

The fabric witch’s shop hid between a belt stall and a place that fixed phones with a screwdriver and faith. It was a space no wider than two women leaning against each other in a bus. Strings of tassels hung from the ceiling like rain you could walk through. The woman at the tiny machine had hair white as salt and fingers that handled satin like she had come to a truce with it after years of war. She lifted her eyes once, and all of them grew formal without meaning to.

“We bring you an old thing pretending to be new,” Luzia said, because if you are asking a woman like this for help, you start by telling the truth as if it were a dish of sweets you brought for her grandchildren.

“Princess,” the seamstress said, and her mouth smiled in the way mouths smile when they have lost teeth they miss. “I don’t do crowns. They snag in the bobbin. I do hems. Hems and shrouds.”

“Then you do what I need.” Luzia slid the handkerchief from her pocket wrapped in another cloth, the way you bring bread you did not bake but respect. She set it on the counter and stepped back, because even the brave do not want to be close when someone tells them a small object is a bomb.

The seamstress did not touch the handkerchief at once. She looked. She leaned down until her bunched hair brushed cotton, and she breathed in. Then she touched one corner with a nail and hummed, a single note like the thread on a spool when it is running out.

“This is not ours,” she said. “Not made here, not made in the places that pretend to be here. The cotton is short-staple but strong like a prayer blanket. The weave is too even for a home. It was made in a house where the machines do not make mistakes because the girls they feed do not dare sneeze.”

“And the letters?” Yara asked. “Those little insect letters. I thought maybe Armenian. Or something from a church that lets God keep knives.”

“They are from a place that does not exist anymore,” the seamstress said briskly, as if cutting a thread. She moved the handkerchief so the light skipped across it and squinted. “Not the script of any government I have paid taxes to. Something made by hands who learned from their grandmothers and then ran before anyone could burn their looms. You do not get this in San Victorino unless someone has come here to look for trouble. The thread—this white thread—it glows a little because it ate light once. Seas do that to thread if the boat it rode did not come to shore right.”

“Ghost thread?” Jimena said, delighted and frightened.

“Ocean thread,” the seamstress corrected. Her finger hovered over the stain that was not a stain. “And this. This is not ink. This is a blue made of an animal that lives in water we do not go into if we want our toes. I have used it to mark a bride’s heel so her shoe will know the direction of her beloved. It does not wash out because it is part of whatever it touches. If this handkerchief has touched your skin, it now knows you better than you want it to.”

“Can you tell where it was made?” Luzia asked softly. She could feel the cloth’s small certainty lodged like a buoy in her chest.

“I can tell where it was mended.” The seamstress smiled with half her mouth. She took a lens from a lanyard and bent low, her back an elegant bow. “Here, see? The hem was undone and redone by a person who did it in the dark, in a boat maybe, or a truck. They did not have time for neatness. The thread they used is from here. Not the store here, but here-here. Bogotá’s thread has a way of fraying because of the weather. You can’t teach thread to keep its manners in a city like this. The mender had nails bitten short and hands that knew how to steal and how to bless a child without being seen.”

“Malena,” Jimena murmured, because it tasted like a name that would learn to be any hand.

The seamstress looked at her for a beat too long and then at Luzia again. “You will pay me by doing what you already do,” she said. “There’s a girl in my building. Her mother wants to take her out of school to sell socks because the rent is shameless. You will find the mother work that pays a little bit more so she can be proud in a way that doesn’t use up her daughter’s back. You will do that and you will leave me some of your perfume because my grandchildren like to make fun of rich smells.”

“I will find her work,” Luzia said, and she meant it like a vow tied to her blood. “You can have all my perfume. It always smells better on other people.”

They left with the handkerchief rewrapped and the seamstress’s smell of hot thread in their hair. San Victorino pressed around them again and spat them into a street without a roof, where the sky had decided on gray and was sticking to it. Luzia felt people’s eyes flick to her face, to her scalp, to her hands, the way you glance at the gap in your teeth when you pass a mirror, not because it is your best feature but because it belongs to you. She had been looked at like that since she grew into her mother’s cheekbones. She had learned not to flinch.

“She mended it here,” Yara said. “Which means Malena, or someone holding her leash, took the original thing across water and then made sure it had Bogotá sewn on top of it. She wanted it to be us and not us.”

“She wants everything to be that,” Jimena said. “I hate her already. I was trying to keep an open mind. I could be polite at a ball. I could not spill wine. Now I want to spill wine and light it on fire.”

“Save the wine,” Taita murmured. “We may need it to bribe the guard at the aqueduct.”

“The aqueduct?” Yara’s head came up like a horse’s when it hears thunder that isn’t thunder. “Since when are we going to the aqueduct?”

“Since Malena is widening cracks that begin below,” Luzia said. “The Salt Cathedral is one kind of below. The city’s throat has others. Water, sewer, bone. The old aqueduct knows where the city keeps its oldest thirsts. If you want to start a panic without lifting a finger, you let people think their water has made a friend of the wrong queen.”

“I prefer not to be a queen of water that smells like trash,” Jimena said. “I like the ocean when it is a postcard or a bathtub.”

They drove east until the streets started getting narrower and then wider again with bridges, until the houses had the look of having been built for the view and then reminded that the view belonged to everyone, until the sky’s gray turned silver where it touched water. The old aqueduct sat like a ribcage someone had forgotten to bury properly, arches graceful as wrists, graffiti laced between pillars like a choir that had decided to sing swear words beautifully. Below, water slid past with the patience of a grandmother waiting for a child to tell the whole truth. A boy smoked under a bridge and watched their car with an expression that had learned its cool from ten men and none of their wisdom.

“You’ll ruin your shoes,” Yara said to Jimena, and Jimena said, “Then I will buy more like a capitalist pig,” but she rolled up her jeans anyway and tied her curls with a string that she bit to hold.

They walked along the lip of the water where the grass tried to be sober and the bottles tried to be invisible. Luzia let her hand hover over the stream until her skin learned the water’s temperature and then dipped the handkerchief in. The stain darkened as if smiling at the place that had given it ancestors.

“What are you doing?” Taita asked, not because he didn’t know but because saying it out loud makes some acts less like accidents.

“Feeding it,” Luzia said. “Letting it remember. If it belongs to her and to here, then it will give up a trace. Threads tell on those who wet them. That seamstress said the mending thread was ours. It will pull toward its siblings like a gossip.”

For a moment nothing happened except the ordinary magic of water making anything in it more beautiful. Then the cloth tugged like a fish that has noticed the hook. Luzia let the pull guide her feet along the bank, slow, the way you walk to keep a baby asleep. It led them under one arch and then another. The graffiti here said the city’s true things in letters too bright to ignore. The handkerchief pulled toward a discolored patch of stone, a place where the mortar had been chipped away in a shape like a mouth.

“She made her own door,” Yara said. “She loves doors. She only likes the ones that weren’t ours first.”

“Everyone loves to pretend to be a locksmith,” Jimena said, and breathed out when a bicycle sped past without hitting her knees.

The mouth smelled of damp that had not chosen a side. Inside, the tunnel breathed back—a long exhale, as if something big had finally decided to let go. Luzia put her ear to stone and listened. She had learned as a girl to understand the difference between nothing and the kind of quiet that means you are being watched. This was the second kind.

“We don’t go in blind,” Taita said, because his job was to remind them of rules that had saved their grandfathers and bored their uncles to death.

“We go in less blind than the people who were here last,” Luzia said, because her job was to break rules without breaking what they protected. She pulled from her bag a little tin that had once held mints from a country that no longer existed and screwed it open. Inside were three pills of light. She thumbed one and it woke, a soft glow the color of the inside of an eyelid on a sunny day. She put one in Yara’s palm, one in Jimena’s. Taita did not take one. He preferred shadows because shadows made his eyes speak native languages.

The tunnel was too narrow for comfort and too wide for ease. The walls had the moisture of secrets. Twice the floor dipped and twice Luzia saw in the dip something metallic, like a can tab or a coin, and twice she did not pick it up because there are coins that buy only curses. The smell was not the Cathedral’s smell. This was city-water, laundry, rat and rain, a trace of hot iron from the rails a block away. Underneath, a sweetness tried to rise and failed, as if jam had been cooked and burnt, as if flowers had been promised and never delivered.

They found the mark where the stone’s mouth opened into a room too square to be natural. The mark was lower than the smear in the salt, a child’s height, and smudged in a circle, as if a small back were pressed there by hands. Jimena swore. Yara’s breath made fog. Taita’s jaw clicked, a sound that meant he was speaking to a patron saint he didn’t like.

“Another harvest,” Yara said, quiet and furious. “They wait in the shining rooms for the parents to get tired. They wait in the kitchens for mothers to go find milk when the store has already closed. They wait under the bridges where the concrete teaches kids how to sleep. And then they take them through holes we fill with chewing gum and spit. It’s a miracle anyone grows up here without turning into the kind of ghost people have useful names for.”

Luzia knelt. She touched the stone under the smudges, touched it with her fingertips, the right ones, the ones she saved for listening. She did not get names—names do not stick to holes unless they want to—but she got a route, a line-of-flight that bruised her imagination and blossomed into a map. She saw a bus painted the wrong color, a bus that had been retired twice but still knew its old schedule. She saw a woman’s skirt brush a child’s knuckles. She saw a handkerchief lifted to a mouth and pressed there, not to silence but to soothe, as if the person offering comfort had learned it second-hand. She saw the city crouched as if to leap.

“She is staging a performance,” Luzia said. “She is building herself an audience and a stage. The lists are programs. The handkerchiefs are tickets. She is going to do the thing she came here to do in front of people who know good seats when they see them.”

“She’s a ghoul,” Jimena said flatly. “And she wants applause.”

“She wants order,” Taita said, and when he said it that way it sounded like the worst insult he could invent. “She is tired of improvisations. She wants a schedule. Men like schedules. They can deny coincidence if you give them enough tables to sit at.”

“Buses,” Yara murmured. Her light pill tossed tiny moons across the stone. “You know how the flyers go up when routes change? She said bus. The boy said he brought the messages on a bike because buses make him dizzy now. The harvests started when they cut the express to save money and made everyone late by twenty minutes. I have a cousin who does safety audits for transit projects. We can steal his passwords and make an altar with them.”

“Steal politely,” Taita said, because even stealing had its saints.

They came back to the light unwillingly. The day had matured into something like alertness. The hills were green with a sarcastic vigor that made Luzia want to climb something and then lie flat on the wet grass until the city forgave her again for not being a mountain. The aqueduct smelled like a promise almost kept. A man in a yellow vest walked past with a bucket and did not see them. A woman pushed a stroller wreathed in plastic and did see them but decided they were not her business.

They returned to Luzia’s apartment because there are some maps you make better with your shoes off. Her rooms were the kind that had been designed to hold paintings and instead held arguments. Every surface had either a plant or a paper on it, sometimes both. The balcony had a view of things tourists take pictures of when they are tired of pretending the city is not beautiful. Taita made coffee with his free hand while his other fed her old radio a battery. The birdcall station came on and made the room feel like a forest had pressed its face to the glass and was considering moving in.

Yara set her laptop on the table and made it spit windows. The map of bus routes webbed in neon lines that looked like nerves traced by a student who had not slept. She layered the dates of the six real lists and the three fakes. She overlaid security footage from corners that could still afford cameras. She added the hours people had reported going to sleep with a daughter and waking up with a police report that taught them how to write their own names without crying. The pattern, which had been nonsense to everyone not born for nonsense, began to tilt into meaning.

Jimena called her cousin who called a man who owed her a kiss and in exchange gave them a file no one was supposed to see, red bars like war paint where names should have been. It said: revision; it said: restructure; it said: optimize, which is a word that does not belong in a city whose bones were laid by people who did not ask for permission before they planted their bodies into roads. From the balcony, the city breathed like a sleeping animal hearing its name.

“They’re piloting night routes,” Yara said. “Four new night buses. The plan goes public in a week. Soft launch before the gala. If you want to kidnap a city’s eyes, you run a test when the sky is too dark for petitions.”

“Do you see the same numbers in the lists?” Luzia asked. “Do you see the stops? The names the council likes because they sound like saints? Do the children’s first letters make a road?”

“They make several,” Yara said. She rubbed her temple with a knuckle and made her face into a machine. “But this one. Look. La Perseverancia. Egipto. Lourdes. Tisquesusa. They spell out the bones of a prayer if you’ve been to public school and had a teacher who made you copy the oaths on the first day of class. The starred name on this latest list, the one that means princess, is set at a stop called Las Nieves. She wants to meet you where the city pretends to be cool.”

“Las Nieves isn’t a stop.” Jimena’s voice bit. “It’s a neighborhood. It’s a promise. It’s a circus. It’s a place you go to be someone you are not for three hours.”

“It’s about to be a stop,” Yara said. She zoomed in until the pixels argued. “They are renaming a platform. It’s in the internal doc here with twelve typos and a signature from a man who went to the same school as a minister’s mistress. They want to call it Nieves-Concordia because they think hyphens make order. They will announce it at the gala. They love announcing things at the gala because everyone is warm and full and clapping.”

“Then that’s where she will draw the line,” Luzia said. She stared at the map until it stopped being lines and started being arteries. “She will make a crack in the floor from below and then put a ribbon across it and ask for scissors. And someone like Don Mateo will laugh with his teeth and say yes.”

“You can’t go,” Jimena said immediately, because she is the friend who always says the thing no one else will and then feeds you when you sulk. “You can’t go where she asks. That’s bad manners. That’s… that’s saying you like someone’s tongue when you haven’t seen their hands.”

“I have to,” Luzia said. “If I do not go, she will dance anyway, and she will dance with someone who thinks the steps are flattery. She has already started writing my name on walls. Better that I choose where I bleed.”

“That is such a princess thing to say,” Jimena said, eyes wet, voice furious. “I hate that about you and I love you and you’re not allowed to make me pick.”

“We won’t let her keep the schedule,” Yara said. She had flicked her screen black and was staring at her reflection instead, which is something women do when they are deciding if they are afraid of the next version of themselves. “We break her clock. We make her late. We make you early.”

“How?” Taita asked. He set a cup of coffee by Luzia’s elbow. The cup was chipped at the lip in exactly the place you put your mouth. The sugar bowl sat between them like a white stone.

“We announce first,” Yara said. “We don’t have a gala. We have a parade. Not the kind with floats. The kind with flyers. We go to the artists who paint in ten seconds on rolling doors. We give them the names with permission. We ask the mothers. We put the names on every route of every bus. We hand the drivers envelopes that say not in my vehicle. We light up the stops so nobody can be invisible there.”

“They will say it is propaganda,” Taita said mildly. “They will say it endangers children by making them famous.”

“They already endanger children by pretending they are not famous enough to be missed,” Yara said, and she had the tone that put men on the defensive and made women text her at two in the morning to say thank you.

“I can talk to the drivers,” Jimena said. “I dated one. I hated his shoes and loved his wrists. He still writes to me when he dreams about cats. He has a mother with a mouth like a machete and a daughter who bites like a colt. He was born for loyalty. Give me a microphone and a room with bad chairs and I will have twenty drivers in tears and thirty more waiting in the doorway to take turns crying.”

Luzia drank her coffee and let the bitterness file her teeth. She saw the plan the way she sees music as a street map. It had curves that had not decided how to bend yet. It had nights that would end with someone at a clinic and someone else at a police station and someone else sleeping under a table because going home would mean hearing the kind of silence that followed certain phone calls. It also had something else: a rumor that would not make her sick to follow.

“Call the girls,” she said to Yara. “Not the ones with jobs that ask them to be nice. The ones who work at night and who know how to make a stranger stop when she says stop. Tell them we will put money in their hands in envelopes and that this isn’t a NGO but a favor. Tell them we will pay extra for good shoes and for having to talk to men who think they won the war.”

“I like them,” Jimena said. “They think my bracelets are stupid and then try them on when I go to the bathroom.”

“Call your cousin,” Luzia said to Jimena. “The one with the file full of night routes. Tell him that if he does not attend our parade he will have to attend Malena’s and she will not let him go home with his name intact. Tell him I will stand in front of any cameras he is afraid of.”

“And me?” Taita said, though he had already put on the jacket that meant he was going to talk to people he did not like and be liked anyway.

“Go to the school by the hill,” she said. “The one with the teacher who writes poems on the board when the electricity dies. Ask her for permission. Ask her for names. Sit with her until she stops shaking. Bring her a sandwich with cheese that sweats grease. Bring her a necklace for her mother painted with varnish. Tell her we will not be late.”

They moved like they were built for it. The apartment became a clearinghouse, a shrine, a kitchen, a war room. Paper grew. Coffee grew. The city outside shifted its weight and listened to itself.

By dusk they had a list of stops and a list of names that had volunteered to be seen. They had a roster of drivers who had sworn to keep their eyes open even when the rain made them want to blink. They had a playlist of cumbias that had no patience for grief. They had, in a cloth shopping bag, seventy-two cans of borrowed paint in colors with names like Gallo at Dusk and Unnamable Blue. They had not enough sleep and too much fear and a greasy handprint in the middle of the plan like a blessing from a saint nobody remembers.

They also had a text. It came to Luzia’s phone as she was tying her hair up with an elastic that used to be part of a bank teller’s paycheck. It was an image: a photo of a bus interior, the plastic seats gleaming slick, the yellow poles like school rulers, the window a rectangle of night. In the aisle, placed neatly like offerings, lay three pairs of children’s shoes. Each pair faced the door. Each pair had a small hydrangea bloom tucked into the toe, blue as bruise. The message under the photo said: You are learning to count. Good. Try counting the doors.

“She’s on a bus,” Yara said, over her shoulder. Her fingers had already hammered three names and four commands into a group chat that had a name you could not say in polite company. “She is on that bus now. She is on a bus that has a working camera and a driver who eats sunflower seeds and spits with accuracy. She is on a bus that will become holy if we are lucky and a crime scene if we aren’t.”

“Which route?” Jimena asked, already on her second phone, her voice sprouting sugar when she talked to men who had trouble saying no.

“The one that will be called Nieves-Concordia,” Yara said. “Of course. Of course she would rehearse on the stage before dress rehearsal.”

“Then we go outside,” Luzia said. She slipped her jacket on and felt the handkerchief crinkle, newly heavy with the day’s work. “We go to Las Nieves. We go with our shoes unpolished and our mouths full of names. We go before the buses bring gossip to the mountain and the mountain decides it is tired of hearing from us.”

A neighbor knocked on the door as Luzia was turning the lock. She was an older woman who had been a singer once and now kept a cat that liked to take naps on the wrong balconies. She held a plastic container of arroz con leche and a look like she had watched a storm break and was trying to decide if it had broken in the right direction. She pushed the container into Luzia’s hands.

“For sugar,” the neighbor said. “To make your tongue remember to be sweet before you have to use it. I had a dream that you were in a room with a floor made out of sky. You were dancing and God was complaining about the soles of your feet.”

“Tell God to send better shoes,” Jimena said, and the neighbor laughed and shook her head and shut her door softly as if afraid of waking the part of the building that slept to keep the rest of them safe.

They walked into a city that had put on its evening face, the one she wears when she wants to be loved by strangers and recognized by friends. Lamps made halos on puddles. Vendors lit charcoal and blew it into meaning. The wind carried laughter like a delivery. Luzia felt the map she hadn’t drawn press against her like a hand at her back. She let it steer her down to the bus stop where a sign said a new name was coming soon. The sign had been wrapped in black plastic and tied with a ribbon. A boy waited with a backpack he hugged like a person. Two girls shared a soda with two straws. An old man read a paper brittle as a leaf and peered at fate through his glasses.

The bus rolled up with the dignity of a crocodile. Its lights made everyone something else for a second and then forgot them. The doors sighed open. The driver had a sunburn on his neck and a sticker of a saint on his dashboard. He looked at Luzia once and then twice and then he lifted his chin, which is how men here say good luck without letting it look like a wish.

They stepped on together. The bus smelled like people and like plastic and like every other bus. It was not special, which is how miracles travel when they are honest. The shoes were gone. The hydrangeas were not. There were blue petals under the seats and blue bruises on the air. Far back, an old woman slept with her mouth open, and behind her sleep sat a shadow that had decided to be patient.

“Good evening,” Luzia said aloud, not to the bus and not to the shadow exactly, but to the space between them where something was being negotiated without her input. “We’re early.”

The bus moved. The city moved. The night got ready to be counted over and over until numbers meant nothing. Luzia put one palm flat against the cool metal pole and listened to it vibrate with the stories of the hands that had held on and the bodies that had swayed. She felt, under the humming of the engine and the heartbeat of the passengers and the shifting of small coins in bags, a second rhythm like a second city deciding, just for an hour, to walk in step with the first. She smiled, but not because she was happy. She smiled because her mouth needed the practice.The bus had the soft sway of a lullaby sung by someone who didn’t believe in sleep, and Luzia let it rock questions loose. She watched the aisle through the reflection in the window because reflections told different truths than the things they reflected, and the shadow at the back watched her back as if it, too, had taken a class in mirrors. Jimena stood with her hips braced against the engine’s hum and spoke out of the side of her mouth about shoes and saints, about the way hydrangeas only turned that particular shade of blue when the soil decided to grow acidic, and Yara hunched over her phone and made the bus’s public screen first hesitate and then obey. Where numbers should have been, the sign above the driver began to name stops and then, almost shyly, to name children: Isaías, Yasmira, Sofi. The passengers noticed the names in the way people notice when the temperature drops one degree. They leaned their weight inside their shoes. They checked the time as if that would fix the weather. The driver, saint sticker glinting like a small shield, opened his fingers and then closed them on the wheel twice, an affirmative only someone who had spent nights on corners would know how to read.

When the bus paused at a light that loved to turn red for people with plans, the shadow near the last row unfolded as if it had been folded by a meticulous aunt. Luzia smelled the lift of jasmine and the deeper layer beneath it, the smell of something sweet that had lost patience, and she did not turn her head because she did not want to give the moment her face. She felt the air shift and knew someone had leaned forward and spooled a lock of hair around a finger because that is what happens when a certain kind of woman sits behind you and wants to test the weight of her attention. “You count like a client,” said a voice that had never stood in line and yet knew intimately how lines bend. “With your lips. I prefer to count with my wrists.” And without waiting for answer, the presence in the back row rolled again into the angle of glass and street and disappeared at the next stop with the ease of a rumor stepping off a curb.

“Las Nieves in two,” the driver said, and the way his hands tightened was a warning and a prayer. Yara’s screen had flattened its frenetic color into an orderly list, and her thumbs flew as she told the drivers who had volunteered to open all doors at the same breath when they saw the signal, the signal being not a flare or a siren but something the city would understand: the first bar of a cumbia that every grandmother had hummed while peeling green plantains. Jimena moved down the bus with the unconscious authority of a girl who knows how to collect debt in jewelry and in favors, telling people in a voice that turned caution into hospitality that the doors would yawn open at the next stop, that no one should shove, that if they heard a whistle it was not a police whistle, it was hers and she had better lungs than most policemen.

They pulled into the platform wrapped in black plastic like a gift that had been in a drawer too long, and the sign that said a new name was coming soon had the self-importance of coats put on in a heat wave. The shelter was already filling with the people who made the city’s evenings hold together: a man with a stack of empanadas and a laugh that made strangers decide this was their corner; a woman selling cigarettes one by one with the authority of a customs official; a boy with a violin that had been taught to be brave; three girls in skirts too short to be practical and too perfect to be accidental, heels planted like anchor points in the asphalt. Further back, under an awning that collected rain the way a freckled shoulder collects sun, two men pushed a cart of paint cans tied together with twine and wore paper crowns some child had forgotten at a birthday party. Above all of that, in the kind of balcony from which grandmothers have learned to yell at grandchildren without needing to say names, a seamstress hung a length of white fabric like a laugh, and it flapped in the moving air with a shape that made people think of sails without deciding they were on a boat.

When the doors hissed and sighed, Luzia lifted a hand as if to conduct and the driver understood like a cousin at a wake; he let the three doors sigh open at once. The movement made the blue petals on the floor of the bus lift and spin as if someone had exhaled small galaxies. The smell shifted too, diluted by air that had known eucalyptus on its way into the city. As she stepped down, she felt for the seam of the crack that hadn’t opened yet. It was there beneath everything, the way a headache is present hours before your body admits to it, and she understood with a kind of a tender anger why Malena had said to count doors. Doors are mouths and exits and promises to leave. Doors put closings into a schedule. Three doors open at once make for a clumsy monster, but they let air through a body that would otherwise sweat itself sick.

They didn’t start shouting. That had been the plan and they kept it, because police like shouting and certain men in ties pretend to hate it and then later are photographed shouting into someone’s belly. Instead, the group that had been a group only in a chat room and in the mouths of women who sold arepas to women who sold their opinions took up brushes and began to paint names, one per pane of plexiglass, one per column of the shelter, one per trash can that had all day taken cups and cigarette ends and the occasional love letter. The paint made the air change the way frying makes the air change, and it smelled like a shoe store, like a school that had put on lipstick for a field trip. People stepped closer not because they wanted to be brave but because curiosity in this city has saved more lives than caution ever did, and someone started that cumbia in a speaker somewhere and the old ones started to sing along even if their mouths didn’t want to.

“The floor,” Yara muttered as if the ground could hear and decide to behave, and in the next breath the asphalt under the black-plastic sign gave a soft complaint like furniture moving. Luzia put her palm flat, the way you soothe a horse, and the way the vibrations ran through her bones told her where the crack wanted to run. It wanted to split the platform cleanly in two so a bus’s front doors would align with one side and the back doors with the other, so that someone like Don Mateo could say later, “How tragic, we did everything right,” while someone like Malena slid through that clean edge like a fish finding the seam between river and sea. She turned to Taita without moving her hand and he was already where he had to be, standing too close to people who did not like men near them and making them like him anyway, diverting weight with his shoulders and his smile and the authority of a man who had told men with actual medals to sit down and had not been shot for it.

“You’re early,” said the smell behind her, which was a style of arrival all its own, and then there was the white of a dress acting innocent as toothpaste and Malena standing as if the crack had been practicing for the curve of her spine. She looked cleaner in the wet light and dirtier under it, a magic none of the salons sale in San Victorino could provide, and she took in the painted names with a flick of her eyes that said she was not here for reading. “I hoped you’d be late, but it is unfashionable to hope. It is almost gauche.”

Luzia did not look at her hands because she didn’t want anyone to think about shaking them. She met those eyes and thought of the phrases that had been written about eyes like that and she decided none of them were convincing. “You invited me to a floor made of sky,” she said, because she loved women who answered metaphors with scented bricks. “I thought I would inspect the scaffolding before the guests arrived.” Around them the cumbia walked itself in circles and the names on plexi multiplied: Camila, Ángel, Milagros, Wilmer, Zoraida. The brushwork was impatient and better for it. The women with the short skirts stepped in and made their signatures curl like a girl’s hair after a day in rain, and one of them stuck a hydrangea petal into the corner of the O in Sofi and then nodded to herself as if she had straightened a picture.

“Cosmetology,” Malena said, as if she were in the business of grading other people’s attempts. “You are a cosmetologist of pain. You are powdered and ready. Consider me impressed, which is not a verb I enjoy.” She leaned in close enough that the outline of her lips was an impolite secret. “Do you ever worry that the city likes me better? You have always been reasonable. Cities are devils. Devils like to be entertained, not managed.”

“Cities like to stay alive,” Luzia said, and she had to keep her voice steady to keep the ground under her in one piece. “They like to keep their water inside their pipes and their children inside their names. If you came here with a boat in your mouth and a sinkhole in your bag, you have found a countryside full of potholes. We are not more impressed by holes just because your dress is white.” With her free hand she lifted the handkerchief the seamstress had diagnosed and let it hang from her fingers long enough for the sea to recognize itself in the stitch. It pulled not toward Malena but toward the square of plastic over the new sign like a needle toward a magnet, the mend longing to nest with the promise of a name it had been told to inhabit.

Malena’s smile pulled as if someone had tugged on a stitch too hard. “You are very good with theater. I appreciate theater. Let me contribute a set change.” She lifted her palm, a motion so contained it barely wrinkled the lace at her wrist, and under the platform the rumble became a low growl. The ribbon that cinched the plastic ruptured in the center like an artery, and the wrapping fell away in a slow spill. Underneath, revealed as if by a magician with a flair for municipal announcements, was the new sign: Nieves-Concordia, the hyphen a skinny bridge no one had asked to cross. For a breath you could hear people decide, each in the privacy of their teeth and lungs, whether they liked the hyphen or hated it, and in that breath Malena stepped back just far enough that Luzia, in reaching for the sign with her handkerchief, would have to remove her palm from the ground that wanted to open.

She didn’t move her hand. She pressed harder. She didn’t like giving the mountain or its cousin the street the impression that she could be played with like a balcony plant. “Yara,” she said without turning her head, and Yara, who had not lifted her eyes from the mess of code and maps and driver calls she had braided on her screen, understood the key her friend had not said out loud. The LED on the bus clicked over not just from numbers to names, but to a pattern. The pattern was not a route any transit engineer had sat and drawn. It was a nursery rhyme that public-school kids knew in their calves because that was how you learn meter in a hot classroom: La Perseverancia clapped into Egipto, Egipto into Lourdes, Lourdes into Tisquesusa, and on through neighborhoods that had been saints, recipes, battles, grandmothers. The rhyme traveled at a speed that hurt the way too much sugar hurts. Drivers on three other routes, cued by the signal, opened all their doors at once and let the rhyme into their buses like a draft.

It was the draft that saved the platform. The crack wanted a neatness—and evil in this city so often did—that would have made a clean split, a before and an after. The air that rushed in through all those open rectangles made the neatness stumble. The fissure’s first run went slightly off a chalked line, and then a little more off, irritated like a cat that had expected a lap and found a cactus. It veered to the left just enough to break the hyphen in the new sign and leave the words Nieves and Concordia looking like cousins in a family that sure as hell wasn’t going to share a kitchen. Someone in the crowd laughed the way you laugh at a wedding when the cake falls and you love the bride enough to make it the best part of the story. The laughter tumbled into other throats because laughter here is contagious when it refuses to be polite.

“You cheapen it,” Malena said, and the way her mouth made the word cheap turned it into an orchestra. “A performative breath. That is how you think history is done. What will you do when I begin taking them in the daylight? When I bring a bus full of parents to the riverside and teach them how to wail again the old way?” Her lip curled like a paper cut. “I am not the one who let the city’s bones protrude. I am only following the line where they already show.”

“You’re saying earthquake and pretending to be a poet,” Jimena shot back, because her mouth collected audacity the way mangoes collect flies, and for a second Malena’s eyes flicked to her as if irritation was a kind of attention she was unaccustomed to paying forward. “You’re saying you are a weathervane. You are a rotten bouquet in a nice room and we will open the windows until you learn it’s breezy here. If you don’t like the view, go haunt a casino.”

“Do not speak to me,” Malena said softly enough to flatten the dance of the paint fumes. “You will not enjoy the consequences.”

“I never do,” Jimena answered, but her hands shook and she tucked them into her jacket pockets where the safety pins lived. Luzia felt the shake through the air around her as you feel thunder before a strike and was not ashamed of the love that tore the air in two lengths.

“What do you want,” Luzia asked, not the way rich men ask when they know they can purchase a look, but in the way a librarian asks a child what ending they would prefer so she can choose the book whose last chapter won’t undo a hard week. The crack had slowed to a sulk and people were stepping carefully around it as if it were a temporary puddle, as if puddles had always tried to pull ankles in. The names on the plexiglass glistened. A man with a broom had come from nowhere and was sweeping blue petals into a neat pile that a child with hair like a catalog photo would later scatter with purpose.

Malena tilted her head and considered honesty as if it were a cucumber at a market, prodding lightly to see if it held water. “Witnesses,” she said at last, and her voice was not soft and not loud and full of invitation in the way of rooms with good drapes. “I want them to watch the change. Your Council will sell the change anyway; they will call it development or safety or modernity and hang it from their teeth like sugarcane. I like to make the animal squeal while they chew. If I take children, it is because I am an old god without a temple and offerings keep the goats away from my laundry. If I take children,” and the way she touched the edge of her white skirt at that if was a signature, “it is because I am furious with the way your city calls them invisible while photographing the things that are not them. I make them more visible than they can bear. That is a cruelty and a cruelty is sometimes a mirror.”

“You can make a mirror without throwing it at people,” Yara said, not looking up, but the way her voice snagged on the word people made the bus shelter into a throat.

Taita had moved, invisible until he wanted to be otherwise, and now stood in that space near two police officers where anyone else would invite a request for documents. He spoke quietly to both and handed one a folded paper with a permit that probably did not exist an hour ago and certainly did not exist yesterday, and both officers studied the painted names as if art might in fact pay their cousins’ rent. They were annoyed by their own tenderness and tried to hide it by adjusting their belts. You could not blame them. Tenderness in public is a stunt that takes more muscle than anyone tells you.

Luzia let Malena’s answer sit on her tongue like a lozenge she refused to suck. The ground had calmed. The buses arrived and left with the rhythm of a heart that had decided to ventilate the whole body. The drivers who were in on the joke opened their doors for an extra three seconds per stop, which is the kind of generosity that looks small to saints and enormous to sinners. On the opposite corner a girl handed out flyers that said not in my vehicle in type that had teeth, and watching a businessman who did not like flyers take one and fold it into his pocket as if it were a promissory note would have been funny if you were not made of nerves.

“Then dance with me under lights,” Luzia said. “Bring your witnesses. Bring mine. Bring the man who thinks a hyphen is a bridge and the woman who will not cross it and the child who knows when a ribbon wants to be cut. Bring your handkerchiefs and your clocks and your long vowels. Do it there in the room where they think money makes air. And know that I will open every door in that house even if I have to break the hinges with my own back.” It wasn’t bravado. It was plans stacked under promises, it was the seamstress’s thread and the driver’s thumb and the little boy with the too-big hat all arranged in a column like saints who have agreed for once to keep an appointment.

Malena laughed, not a sound like a bell, not a bad laugh, just a laugh that belonged to a woman who believed she had always gotten her way. “The Ball, then,” she said, as if she were naming a dog she didn’t expect to come when called. “I do appreciate a choreographer with spinal commitment. Do not be offended when the floor makes desert of your sky.” She touched the lettered front of the sign where the hyphen had broken as if it were the split in a lip, and for a second her fingers left a stain like seawater on wood. “Do not be late,” she added without looking at Luzia, as she stepped backward into air that did not push back and found herself in a bus that had just opened its doors as if at her request. The bus shuddered as she touched its step; the driver’s saint sticker fogged at the edges; three passengers coughed the way you cough when you smell a summer gone wrong, and then the doors closed and the bus took her away with a stateliness that made the people on the platform disapprove of themselves for watching.

They did not clap when she left. They went on painting. This was one kind of victory. A girl with a chipped bicuspid made a flourish under her brother’s name that would have made her art teacher proud and then leaned her cheek against her shoulder to keep from crying. The violin boy tuned his open strings out of habit, the best kind of faith there is, and eased a few notes into the common oxygen, itchy notes still, notes with knots in their backs. Yara downloaded a copy of the camera footage knowing the police cameras would lose theirs in the exact minute everyone wanted and decided to broadcast it at midnight without permission because she had never found permission to be relevant. Jimena started speaking to one of the officers about how hard it is to clean certain smells out of certain fabrics, how you have to soak without scrubbing, and both men found themselves nodding as if they owned a single shirt between them.

Later, when light had moved itself out of the street and the names on the shelter found themselves illuminated by the kind of blue that makes everyone’s skin look braver, they drifted to a stand that had turned a cooler into a shrine and drank coffee that had been boiled too many times and sweetened into forgiveness. The crack in the platform was caution-taped by a man who had not enjoyed the first half of his day and had decided to enjoy this part marking danger for once with authority. The plastic from the sign lay in a heap and two children had fashioned it into capes and were running in tight circles calling themselves storms. The old woman who had been sleeping at the back of the bus earlier shuffled by and tapped the O in Sofi with a careful fingernail. “I had a Sofi,” she said to the air and to Luzia and to anyone who would take the weight. “She went to study hair. They took her in a car with a rosary on the mirror. They left her hair on our front step like a cat brings a bird. Now I sew in the market and I don’t look boys in the face. But this O,” she tapped again, as if testing a melon, “this O is good. She likes round things. She will sit here until she is finished with the things they didn’t let her finish.”

Taita put a hand on the woman’s shoulder the way an uncle does when a niece stoops to tie her shoe, and in the feel of that hand was the only prayer anyone had energy for. “If you want to work somewhere else, there is a seamstress who could use someone with steady eyes,” he said without promising safety and without promising payment and therefore without lying. The woman’s shoulders tightened and then relaxed as if someone had pressed on the right nerve and she lifted her chin, which in this city is how you say yes without making the gods jealous.

By the time the paint had dried enough that rain would only soften the edges rather than wash them away, the neighborhood had decided to keep the hyphen broken for at least a week and probably a month, and somewhere a man in the Mayor’s office was practicing a statement that would use the word vandalism and the word tragedy in the same sentence and be applauded by exactly one audience. They packed the leftover paint, returned borrowed ladders, kissed cheeks without count because counting is for days you will remember later, and walked home along streets that recognized their pace. On a corner a girl in purple shoes that were not practical for running handed Luzia a flyer she had printed on a borrowed printer with a ribbon of ink that didn’t want to be generous. The flyer said, in crude letters that became elegant the more you read them, we will meet you on tile floors and we will make them grow grass. Luzia folded it and put it with the handkerchief because it was made of the same material, the kind you don’t wash out.

At her apartment, the birdcall radio had gone from warblers to something that sounded like a joke told by a creek. She showered until her skin gave back the day and then wiped steam from the mirror with the flat of her palm and met her own eyes the way you look at a neighbor you have seen crying and decided not to ask about yet. Jimena fell asleep on her couch with one arm across her eyes and the other across her stomach like armor, and Yara snored softly with her mouth open and dreamed, judging by the fingers of her left hand, of typing, which is a comic habit fate sometimes reserves for girls who dare. Taita sat awake with the radio low and the window open to listen to the night’s gossip and made a list in his head of the men he would have to speak to before noon if the parade of names was to be allowed again tomorrow; it was a list he did not write down because paper has a tendency to travel without permission.

Sometime between the hour the city calls cats and the hour it calls bread, Luzia woke to the smell of rice boiled with milk and cinnamon, and remembered the neighbor’s offering still on the counter like a good luck charm with a spoon. She ate it standing in the kitchen, half awake, and as she finished, her phone blinked its living green and gave a soft insect buzz. It was a message with a photograph that had not been taken here. It showed a room with a floor not of sky but of tile, the kind of tile with flowers frozen under a glaze so clear it looks like ice. There were shoes there too, not children’s this time, but the shoes of women who had money either because their husbands did or because their grandmothers had taught them to play a long game in short heels. The shoes were arranged around a glossed rectangle that reflected a chandelier which had decided to think well of itself. The caption read, with the sweetness of the same lozenge still unsucked: Bring your new names to my ballroom. Bring your sharp breath. Bring your girls with bracelets. I will bring a proper broom. The word “proper” wore perfume like a bruise.

She wrote back without conferring with the committee that were her friends because there are moments for democracy and moments for monarchy and she had the blood for both. She wrote: We will bring more than names. We will bring the drivers. We will bring the ones who clean your scent out of carpets. We will bring a radio that only plays birds. We will bring a seamstress who will spit on the floor to bless it. We will bring the bus doors and leave them open. The sending ring moved and the message flew and came back with a little delivered check mark that seemed to smirk.

On the balcony, dawn did that thing it does every day regardless, and spread itself thin and then thick and then civic. The city stretched. The mountain coughed. The buses snorted and edged their heavy bodies into the river of morning. Somewhere a boy with a hat too large for him woke and counted his sisters’ breaths until he got bored of being afraid. Somewhere a mother wrote over a name on a list with a pen that had chewed foam around its tip and pressed until the paper tore and she could feel how little the tearing did to her rage. Somewhere in a room with tiles and real flowers imprisoned under glaze, a woman in white plucked a black hair from her brush and wound it around her finger and said a name that was not hers to a mirror and waited to see if the door in the glass would open.

The plan grew teeth and then it grew legs. There were calls to make to the sound guy who set up speakers for a candidate’s rallies and to the woman who supplied the ice for those same rallies and thus knew which doors in the convention hall stuck when it rained. There were visits to the school on the hill to ask permission without papers and to give out rain ponchos that made children feel invincible. There were envelopes to fill and there were hands to press money into, which is to say there was trust to shove into the economy where it might turn into rent. There were drivers to feed late at night when the stomach grows ambitious and to laugh with at dawn when the stomach changes its mind, and there were names like spray paint in the throat, names to be exhaled as if they were smoke.

On the second night of painting, after the police learned how not to trip over caution tape and after Don Mateo made a speech on television about disorder as if disorder had just learned to walk, a boy no older than the little absences on their lists came to the platform and stood with his hands in his pockets and watched them write. He had a hat too big for him and a bicycle that had found ways to stay stolen, and when he stepped closer and tugged at Luzia’s sleeve he did not say hello. He said, “We saw you. My sisters and me. She told us to count the doors and we told her we couldn’t count so high. She said she would teach us if we brought her a present.” He kicked the toe of his shoe against the crack as if it were a cousin who needed reminding. “She likes candy made in other countries. She likes the colors on the wrappers. She said she would give us wrappers to play with. She didn’t. Can I paint my sister’s name in red. She likes red. She says it is not fair the only red the men like is on flags.”

“Paint it,” Luzia said, and stood there and watched him choose the ugly beautiful red that dripped on everything and made the letters look like they had come out of a mouth with new teeth. He wrote the name with a steadiness learned from mornings writing on concrete with water: Angie, the G too big, the E proud. Around them the city clattered and preened, and under everything the swell of something older than buses took a breath she did not mistake for permission and did not mistake for threat. It was just a breath. She had learned in this long life to love just a breath.The day sharpened its elbows and shoved, and Luzia let herself be jostled because that is how you learn when the city is nervous. She and Taita went by foot because it was faster to be delayed by people than by cars, and their route folded through streets whose shutters were still rubbing sleep from their hinges. They turned into the service alley behind the convention hall where the Ball would be held, the alley that smelled of out-breathed air and the chemistry of clean. Steam sighed out of the mouth of a drain like an old song, and a woman with arms like lampposts and a bun that could have held four pens and a pencil looked up from a mop bucket and measured them with a glance that did not waste inches.

“Doña Paulina,” Taita said, and he took off his cap the way you take off a weapon. “We need to talk to the queen.”

“You’re late,” she said, not unkindly. She wrung her mop with a twist that could have broken a chicken’s neck and propped the handle against her shoulder as if it were a pike. “The princes leave footprints that don’t want to be cleaned and the ladies spill sugar with their talk. Today I am a river with no patience. Speak.”

Luzia told her what she wanted to do as if she were confessing a crime she fully intended to commit again. She said that a thing without a temple was coming to make a floor think it was an ocean, and that she wanted to bring grass to the ocean and open all the doors without the alarms shrieking like geese. She said that she did not want to make work for women who already did the work of gods. Doña Paulina listened with the face of a woman who has thrown out her share of men and kept her share of secrets.

“Doors,” she said at last, and tapped her bottom lip with a knuckle. Her hands smelled of lemon and old pennies. “We have doors for the people who bring the ice. We have doors for the people who bring the meat. We have doors for the ministers who bring their own chairs. The fire inspector says how many can open at once and the man with the key breaks his key weekly on the lock that sticks in the rain. You can open doors if you stand near them with your hand on the handle and the eye of a mother of four. You can open doors if you are not afraid to get yelled at by someone whose suit costs a forehead.” She leaned closer. “What do you pay me for doing this in front of cameras?”

“A schedule that lets your daughters finish school,” Taita said before Luzia could offer her own blood. “A contract with fewer hyphens and more money in the boxes that matter. A security chief who listens when you say the exits are blocked by flowers. And a man to talk to your son about the army who doesn’t wear the army like a perfume.”

Doña Paulina snorted, her laugh like a broom handle against a sink. She shook their hands not to pretend they were equals but to make them complicit. “We put vinegar in the water,” she said. “When the smell comes, we wash with vinegar and salt, and we don’t ask anyone’s permission to do it. The women who change the linens will carry cherries to put in the mouths of the vases so the air thinks twice. Bring your grass. Just don’t leave me with mud.” She turned away and whistled a long note that gathered a small army of women from the shadows, each with a bucket, each with a rag slung over a shoulder like a sash of office. The army took the hallway into itself and moved like a river that had found a purpose besides downhill.

Yara met them at the loading bay with a donkey cart that had once been a truck. On it lay a door as heavy as a confession. It was green under its scratches and had the memory of a bus stamped into its bones: scuffs at the height of children’s hands, a little rust at the hinge where boys had hung to ride for free, a sticker of a sun half-peeled. “The museum thinks it is an installation,” Yara said, hair stuck to her forehead in threads like run-out stitches. “I wrote a press release that made curators cry, with phrases like urban river of passage and prosthetic of breath. The Foundation signed without reading. Everyone wants to look like they have a soul this month.”

The man at the gate who collected signatures and kept his own smiles had a cousin who owed Jimena a pair of earrings, so the bus door became art and was wheeled under white lights until it glowed like a saint who had surprised herself into faith. The gallery manager, a boy with a knot in his tie like a dimple, read the name on the label—Transit of Angels—and patted the door as if it might thank him. “How very… relevant,” he said, and smiled at his reflection in its chipped window.

The seamstress arrived with a satchel that had made trips only mule-backs can make and refused to be searched because some women carry their sovereignty the way other people carry allergies. She looked at the floor through the soles of her shoes and declared the glaze cheap and the flowers under the glaze prisoned but stubborn. She licked her finger and touched a corner tile and nodded as if tasting soup. “We can stitch,” she said to Luzia in a voice that would not carry beyond a sweep of broom. “Not your kind of stitching. A seam between the tile and what is beneath. It will not hold forever, but it will be an insult to anyone who tries to break it. I brought thread that knows water and salt and knees.”

“Spit somewhere,” Jimena whispered. “I promised them you would spit.”

The seamstress spat, neat, like a signature. Two caterers in black vests saw and smiled without meaning to. Later they would tell their cousins that the princess brought a witch to the Ball and the witch spit and the glasses didn’t break that night and so maybe the devil was accepting bids.

They went to the florist because hydrangeas had suddenly become letters and they needed alphabet and punctuation. The shop had a cooler whose breath made the room into a small winter, and the buckets were crammed with heads like theory: blue, pink, white, each color the report of a soil’s mood. The woman behind the counter had wrists wrapped in twine and the suspicion of a gardener whose clients snapped stems in photographs. “You want pink,” she said after a minute, when they said blue was an enemy’s signature. “Pink is a matter of pride. You feed the plant alkaline like a lie, baking soda and the memory of shells, and it turns girlish on you. People like to say that blue is more expensive. People like to say many things. How many do you want?”

“Enough to make a rumor blush,” Luzia said, which made the florist tilt her head as if someone had said a new holy word. They left with a promise of boxes tied with ribbon that would offend Malena’s nose and please old women, with sachets of crushed eggshell to be hid under the stage where the podium would stand, with a jasmine vine in a pot that had already decided to climb. Yara paid and touched the bell by the register three times as if ringing for service from the underworld, and the florist covered the bell with her palm and said softly, “Don’t do that unless you have soup ready.”

They went next to a place that sharpened skates in December and trowels in June and ironically specialized in fishhooks for reasons no one had asked it to, and there a mechanic with a hearing aid and a halo of hair around a map of scalp sold them lengths of chain and a handful of leather gloves that still smelled of the cows that had once had hopes. “You don’t buy chain unless you want to hold something that insists on movement,” he said, not looking up from the blade he was making tell him its name. “Make sure you don’t want rope instead. Rope forgives. Chain remembers.”

“Chain,” Yara said, and didn’t say for what. The mechanic nodded at Luzia as if recognizing a tiger from a page in a book and wrapped the chain in newspaper as if he were meat.

In the late afternoon, when afternoons remember they used to be evenings, they went to the seamstress’s tiny shop to collect things that did not look like weapons. Dresses like rivers. Jackets like arguments. Pockets sewn into places where pockets had no right to be and pockets sewn shut in case of greed. The seamstress had stitched charms into hems: a sprig of rosemary that would give courage to the mouth, a penny that had been in a Madonna’s fountain for luck, three hairs from a horse’s tail for speed, a knot tied by a laughing child for favor. She trimmed Luzia’s sleeve and muttered a prayer that wasn’t Catholic and pinned a little raven near the hip where a sash would hide it. “For messages you don’t want to hear,” she said, because women build in fail-safes and the seamstress had lost too many babies to let a princess go unarmored.

When dusk limped in, tired from the day’s stairs, they turned their attention to air. Yara had charmed the sound man with a soup of compliments and cables and now had access to the guts of the hall, its ducts and vents and the little cathedral of a control room with sliders that made theater of temperature. The plan was simple enough to be difficult: when the smell came, they would lift eucalyptus and pine through the systems in a way that did not scream cover-up but suggested forest. The swamp would not like it. Birdcalls would come in not as song but as a noise the building would think was its own heart.

“Do you think birds scare her?” Jimena asked. She had painted her mouth the color of a plum and then bitten it once so it looked like fruit.

“I think things that remember migration disturb anything that thinks it owns a horizon,” Yara said, fingers dancing over sliders with the confidence of a girl who had learned piano and left. “I think if we flood the room with the idea of leaving at any moment, it will make her ankles itch.”

“How do you flood a room with an idea?” one of the bartenders asked as he skewered olives into neat rows. He wore his bow tie at a tilt and his eyes on the exits.

“You do this,” Yara said, and played the sound of the first three seconds of a song every grandmother had taught on a porch. Then she stopped. The room didn’t exhale. It thought about exhaling. That is what ideas do when you make them loud.

The night before the Ball was the kind where dogs lose patience and men find reason, the moon a coin someone had chewed. The Council house glowed like a promise behind glass. Luzia went home and lay on her back and felt the floor push against her the way a stage pushes back against a dancer when it wants to test her knees. She slept in bits, the kind of sleep that comes in papers and must be collated, and woke knowing her mother’s left shoe had never been found after their last Ball before exile. She told the ceiling that if Malena tried to make a story out of that, she would tear the story’s dress.

Morning cracked its knuckles and started. The seamstress sent a message that simply read: I will be late, I am sewing something that refuses. The florist’s son sent a photo of pink hydrangeas with a caption like a declaration: the soil obeys some women, and my mother is one. The boy with the too-big hat did not appear and Luzia decided not to decide if that was good or bad. Don Mateo sent a string of messages with commas where apologies should have been: she will be on the dais; she has made a donation that will build a clinic, look at the numbers; the Minister of Energy has opinions; do wear something that makes them stop guessing.

They dressed in an apartment that had seen more sleeping on couches than sleeping in beds and laughed the way you laugh when someone is threading a needle through your waist. Jimena wore a dress that looked simple until she moved and became complex like a legal argument. She strapped knives to her calves and then replaced them with combs because this wasn’t that kind of party. Yara wore black because sometimes black is an exorcism and sometimes it is a stagehand, and tonight she wanted to be both. She had a small screwdriver in her hair as decoration, or that was what she told security. Taita put on the suit that had buried his mother and two of his enemies, softened a little at the elbows and stubborn at the seams, and as he buttoned the jacket he said to the air in the tone of a man who had made deals with scarier entities, “Hoy no, vieja,” to a ghost who had second thoughts about being dead.

The Foundation building shone with borrowed money and good intentions. The carpet in the lobby had been sat upon by presidents and by children told to wait, and the chandeliers had watched men lie and remembered how to glitter while they did. Women in dresses that made them reinvent posture kissed air by the liter. Men in suits practiced the faces they had cultivated for cameras. The Radio of Birds in the control room hummed along to the HVAC like a patient in an oxygen tent. The hydrangeas glowed in their vases like throats about to sing. Over the atrium, the bus door hung in a square of light and a placard said Transit of Angels: On the Ethics of Passage, and three people had photographs taken with it already, which made Yara shake her head and type something on a group chat that was mostly consonants and affection.

It began, as these things always begin, with the wrong speech. The Master of Ceremonies—a man with a jaw that had cost more than some women’s weddings—talked about generosity and about the city as if it were a casual acquaintance and mispronounced two neighborhoods that had more people in them than his favorite television station gets at three in the morning. Someone clapped for each cliché because clapping is easier than dissent in a room where the ceiling might be listening. Luzia moved through the place like a shadow trying to remember how to be a person with jewelry. She touched the bus door with two fingers and felt it vibrate with the throats of routes and the twitch of old doors that had been slammed by impatient lovers. She greeted the women who had set out the glassware and they gave her the look that means we don’t have time to like you but we will, later, if you survive.

When Malena came into the room, it was like a cold placed on a lip where a fever blister is thinking of blooming. Heads turned faster than men can stand to admit they are headless without being the center. The dress was white again because she believed in tropes, but the white was older tonight, like paper that had been written on in milk. Her hair was a river that had not yet decided which rapids to choose. The smell arrived not as storm but as fog creeping under a door. Women smoothed their dresses because the air made them. Men adjusted cuffs they would have adjusted anyway. The tiles, the ones with flowers under captivity, sweated in the perfect geometry of a skin's pores.

“Good evening to the donors,” Malena said without a microphone, and the room heard her. “Good evening to the peasants who clean up after the donors and to the peasants who are donors when no one is looking. Good evening to the princess and to the mountain and to the old gods who got bored of waiting for altars and came to the city to take a job.” People laughed because they didn’t know where to put their hands. Don Mateo took half a step forward and then into a smile because he had learned that sometimes the only response to a thief is a grin.

She did not wait for invitation to mount the dais. She stepped on it the way you step on a stain when you want to hide it without bending over. She touched the podium, and the seam where the jasmine had been tucked into the underside stirred hurt in the plant and sent up a little courage. She looked at the bus door hanging like a paradox over the room and smiled with her teeth for the first time, and the teeth were beautiful in the way of things that have never been used for biting apples.

“We will rename a stop,” she said, and she made the word rename sound like a communion. “We will build a clinic. We will—oh, it’s all so good, so noble, so hygienic. We will, we will, we will.” She laid her palm flat on the lacquered wood and every parent in the room stood up inside their skin without moving.

Across the hall, as planned, the seamstress took her thread between her fingers like a vein, kissed it once, and slid the needle into the little spaces between tile and grout. She made a stitch that history doesn’t record because historians don’t know which knees to look under, and with each lovely little push and pull, the floor forgot it wanted a crack and remembered it enjoyed being admired. Doña Paulina and her army positioned themselves around the hinges no one thought about and their buckets smelled of vinegar and remembering. Yara lifted a fader in the control room and the air grew a little forest behind the perfume. The sound of a bird—one of the uncomplicated ones, a gray-breasted, no poetry attached—pinged softly under the clink of glasses like a conscience.

“Doors,” Malena said, almost languidly. “I have never liked doors.” She swept her hand as if spreading icing on a cake and the ballroom’s automatic doors ceased to believe in timers. They juddered half open and stuck, a mechanical stutter that made two security men exchange a look like cousins at a funeral. The doors to the service hall thought about their hinges, and two gave soft prolonged sighs as if deciding to tell secrets. The door to the kitchen swung with a will and a waiter walking too quickly with oysters barely saved the oysters from becoming a metaphor.

“Open them all,” Luzia said to the man with the hearing aid who stood near the control panel for fire systems, and he, who had been carving names into the air with his eyes for forty years, pulled the latch on habit and called up the last time he had ignored protocol in the right direction. Emergency exits clicked, the sound small but destructive to the geometry desire likes, and a breeze walked barefoot through the room. The breeze carried eucalyptus and faintly, faintly, bus brake.

She stepped into the floor’s attention without needing to climb anything because the floor had decided it knew how to listen. She wore the raven near her hip and a handkerchief that a sea had once marked and she carried nothing else that would show up in a photograph and be argued about in columns. She said nothing to begin with. She just stood, the way she had learned from teachers who understood that silence is the first syllable of ritual, and let the doors do their counting. The hydrangeas in their glass verbs watched her, pink and puzzled. Malena tilted her chin, amused because she was inclined that way by design.

“If you want witnesses,” Luzia said when the room had breathed her into being, “you will have them.” She lifted her hand, and the bus door shining like a saint’s relic at a procession lowered on its pulley as if it had decided to leave religion. The chain rasped, the mechanic’s memory of cows rustled, and the door came down on wheels and kissed the tile with a little knock. Two drivers in black suits with safety stripes hidden beneath slid from their stations at the edge of the room to flank it, their hands on the handle as a man might brace a cradle. Their faces were church-serious. One of them had a scar like a comma at his temple. They were not there to stop anyone. They were there to offer an option.

Malena laughed again, a better laugh this time, warmer, approving of the show. “You brought props,” she said. “How adorable. Shall I bring actors?” She clapped once, so quietly that only people with wounds heard it, and from the service hall came a procession that broke five rules of etiquette and one of physics. Children. Six of them, hair combed as if this were a wedding, knees shining as if soot had been polished off them recently. They walked with that exaggerated care children learn in rooms where breaking anything is a fine, and their hands were empty and that was the most awful part, their hands that should have held cheap plastic. Every mother in the room moved, externally by an infinitesimal, internally by kilometers.

Doña Paulina swore under her breath in a pattern her grandmother had taught her and moved her army as if rearranging furniture. The seamstress’s thread tugged in her fingers with a sulk. Yara’s faders looked suddenly like ribs. Jimena walked, not to the children, because you do not rush a deer, but to the women who were putting out dessert and said in a voice like a supplication, “Give me napkins.” They handed her linen, folded, white as surrender. She shook them open and handed one to each of the girls on the edge of the room who worked in heels and happiness and did not trouble to declare it anything else. “When I whistle,” she said, and the girls nodded, their earrings turning, their eyes lighting in that way you only get when someone gives you instructions that are not demeaning.

“You said we would be seen,” Malena said to Luzia almost gently. “Don’t make me do all the work. Name them. If you name them they will be hard to steal. If you name them and they disappear, you will be told it is your fault. What will you choose? Silence or naming? It is such a tired dialectic and yet we go on performing it at great expense.”

“You have been reading cretinous columns,” Luzia said. “Try novels.” She lifted her chin and looked at the children and saw that their collars had been buttoned with hands that had left flour on their buttons. “Isaías,” she said, because he was in the front with ears that stuck out like a family story. His mouth opened. “Camila,” she said, because the braid down the back was too proud to ignore. “Sofi,” she said, because you say Sofi the way you breathe when you want to be forgiven. “Ángel,” she said, because there is always an Ángel who needs someone to say his name in a room where people pretend irony is a currency. As she named, the drivers’ hands tightened. Names embroidered the air like thread the seamstress would approve.

“Luzia,” Malena said with that lightness that is almost kindness and almost mockery. “We will dance and you will lose your shoes.” She put her two bare fingers in her mouth and whistled a thin note and the tiles at the edge of the dais buckled like a lip curling. One of the children tottered and caught himself on a chair back and made a sound like a kitten, and the sound traveled down the hall to the truck that filled ice and the man cutting lemons flinched.

Now. The napkins. Jimena whistled and it was not a thin sound. It was a bicycle bell and a market call and the first finger on the rim of a glass, and the girls in the short skirts and excellent heels moved like choreography never sees, smooth, sudden, collective, and they put the linens on the tiles the way you put a tablecloth on for saints. They laid the white under small feet as if declaring this ground to be dining. “Eat,” one of them said to no one and everyone, and the children stepped onto the cloths and the floor, insulted at last, paused its sulk to consider how a napkin is not a floor and how perhaps it is fine to allow a napkin to be a floor if you are losing a fight to mercy.

From the corner by the bus door, the seamstress slid her needle under the white and bit off a thread and made another stitch and whispered in her lost tongue a word that was probably the name of a plant and also the name of a saint and also the name of a girl who had refused to die all the way. The buses in other parts of the city opened their doors in unintentionally sympathetic rhythm because someone in a cab was listening to the cumbia and someone in a patrol car hummed along and someone on a motorcycle decided not to speed and the city, which hates to cohere, cohered.

The hydrangeas in their vases went pinker, so pink you could see grandmothers reconsidering their prejudices while holding their glasses of dry sparkling water. The smell that rode in with Malena pulled tight as if trying to exit through a window, and the eucalyptus flexed. The birdcalls came a little louder and people laughed because they did not know that birds in a ballroom mean survival and not interior design. Don Mateo stood with his hand on a chair back and felt suddenly as if he were standing in the last photograph taken of a dynasty and wondered if his tie would look silly to historians. It would.

Malena watched the napkins, the threads, the bus door with her head at an angle a cat would have disrespected. “You are making ceremony out of inconvenience,” she said. “It will not save you when I decide to bring water. I have boats. I have so many boats. The water loves me even when I forget its birthday.” Her voice rasped on loves as if it had to drag the word over pebbles.

“Then bring it,” Luzia said, and her mouth went dry because you should never ask a goddess to show you her weapon unless you are prepared to see your own bones, but also because she was tired of men and their speeches and because the seamstress was stitching her hands raw and because the children were swaying a little on their feet. “Bring it now. Here. Don’t do it in the middle of the night to a woman on a bus who has just told a joke that made strangers fall in love with her. Bring it where the donors can spill it on their shoes.”

For a second, the room turned its head as if scent had called it. The vents exhaled something like a laugh and like a cough. The chandeliers twitched. The tiles made a noise like a mouth ungluing from sugar. Somewhere, very far below, the old aqueduct considered if it was in the mood to be a metaphor again and decided that although it did not enjoy fashion, it did like to make itself relevant.

“Very well,” Malena said, and she opened her mouth and hummed. It was not the humming of a woman soothing a child. It was the humming of a thing that had waited at a dock until it had learned the names of all the knots and then tied itself a noose and called it jewelry. The hum went lowest through the soles of the most expensive shoes. It found the floor where the flowers waited to be praised and pressed up. People shivered. The glasses on trays chimed a small chorus and the men carrying them cursed theatrically.

Yara slid a slider and the doors on three sides of the room opened fully, which is a decision buildings unnaturally dislike, and the night came in with city and eucalyptus and the faint clean knife of rain. The napkins lifted at one corner as if wanting to fly. The bus door, which had seen rain in its life, smiled in its paint. The drivers lifted their hands just enough to look like saints in a mural, palms out, and every person in the room who had ever been on a bus felt a muscle memory resolve in their chest, the little relaxation you get when a handle is there.

Water came. Not a flood. That will be for another night, because even gods with boats must keep a schedule. It came in a language that tiles speak, a thin seep at the seam where the flowers met grout, a darkening that made the pink of the hydrangeas bolder as if daring. It licked at a child’s shoe and retreated because the shoe was standing on linen and linen smells of bodies and saints. It fingered the edge of the dais with a rude curiosity and was snapped at by vinegar. It came in and was forced out through the doors by a breeze made by a room with all its mouths open at once, and the birdcalls stepped sideways into the hum so that it sounded for just a breath like a song about a river sung by a woman who had decided to stop asking permission to live.

“Enough,” Malena said sharply, and for the first time she sounded bored in a way that was more fury than fatigue. The children looked at her and you could see in their faces the comprehension that some adults are a weather and must be dressed for accordingly, and that others are a building and must be exited safely. She looked at the bus door and there was no kindness in that look and the bus door shrugged like a fisherman who has found in his net a prophecy he did not order.

The thing under them—the old channels, the old thirsts—was not done even if Malena was. It shifted. If you had put your ear to the tile you would have heard rats reconsider programmatic loyalties and pipes revisit their joinery like old cousins checking whether their grudges had aged well. The bus door’s window fogged briefly as if someone had breathed on it from the other side of an old story. The chain creaked as if it remembered cows. The seamstress’s needle snapped and she laughed once like a woman who had bit her own tongue and tasted iron and decided it was delicious.

“After-dinner entertainment,” the Master of Ceremonies bleated into a microphone with the blank bravery of a man who has pureed fear into public speaking, and people clapped because it would be impolite not to. Don Mateo stepped toward Luzia with the look on his face of a man who is about to ask a daughter to consider her optics, and Yara coughed into her hand the word no in three syllables and backed him up with technology, and Jimena took the children by the hands the way a waitress takes plates and slipped them like tips into the kitchen where Doña Paulina’s army had already laid out chairs for little knees.

Malena stood at the mouth of the dais and watched the doors like a mathematician with a lover. The brim of her dress took a stain like a flag takes a wind and she did not move to avoid it. When she looked at Luzia, the look was not hungry, and not greedy, and not anything you could purchase something to cure. It was a look a mirror gives when it shows you not yourself but the person who stands behind you ten years from now and you are not sure if you are pleased. “Do not be late,” she said again, forced to habit by fate like the rest of them, and her voice had a chip in it now, a tiny imperfection that made it better like a clay pot that is a little cracked and therefore precious to cooks.

“I will be here when you arrive,” Luzia said, which is the bravest lie a woman can make and the truest promise if she has the correct set of stubborn friends. The grin that came off Malena’s mouth was quick and pretty and ugly all at once and then she was gone, not in a magic flicker but in the very ordinary way of a woman walking out of a room with a case of boredom under her arm.

For a minute the room behaved the way rooms behave after conversations they will tell their cousins about. People moved because not moving would be noticed. Women who had never ridden a bus came to stand by the bus door and felt, to their private chagrin, the little wash of relief it offers even when nothing is moving. Men whose work required them to drink shook their glasses with ice like rattles and laughed as if that were a reasonable weapon. The children ate, not because anyone told them to but because that is how you end a grand scene without letting it eat you.

Outside, the city hummed, adjusted the placement of her bracelets, flexed a new crack and decided not to widen it yet. The mountain sat and watched the room where once men counted coins and now counted donors and where tonight two women had counted doors, and it remembered when doors were caves and caves were mouths and mouths were names. The radios that played birds jabbered on, and some husbands who had married for status and some wives who had married for status took each other’s hands in the car afterward and didn’t let go for a block and a half, surprised by their own vertebrae.

Backstage, in the breath between applause and critique, the seamstress wrapped her snapped needle in a twist of paper as if it were a hair kept for luck and spit one last time to finish the blessing. Doña Paulina sat on an upturned crate, rubbed her knee, and told the story of how her grandmother had held a church shut in a storm with only her body and a braid. The drivers leaned against a catering cart and ate cubes of cheese like soldiers, and one of them cried quietly because he had recognized in one of the children a chin that belonged to the woman who sold him cigarettes and math, and it is difficult to be brave about chins.

Yara wrote a set of instructions for the doors and taped them in a place where only people who mattered would see, in language that made sense even if you had never seen a schematic. Jimena kissed a girl in the service corridor and the kiss tasted of vinegar and sugar and somebody else’s gum and she said, against the girl’s mouth, “Later we will dance on a floor that makes grass,” and the girl said, “Don’t you dare lie to me,” and Jimena said, “I have eczema, not lying,” and the girl laughed, which is a contract if you know how to honor it.

Luzia stood alone for a breath in the center of the room that had been a storm and let her knees learn what they needed to know. She listened for the rumor that would tell her the direction of the next crack and heard, before anything else, the sound of paper rubbed by thumbs, the lists being folded, unfolded, carried, lost, found, taped to refrigerators, tucked under saint statues on crowded shelves. She heard water decide it would like to participate again soon. She heard a bus brake a block away and it sounded like a long polite throat-clearing, as if a city had been waiting to be asked into a dance and had finally been asked and was losing its head about it.By morning the city had tired of pretending last night was a rumor. It woke with paint on its fingers and a sore spot where the hyphen had been split, and the news crawled up out of its beds in suits to explain what had happened to people who already knew. There were headlines with verbs that liked to posture—erupts, disrupts, haunts—and there were photographs taken from flattering angles of men in jackets looking troubled. Someone filmed the moment the bus door kissed the tile and posted it with a caption that made girls with pierced eyebrows laugh; the clip bloomed, and overnight men who had never been grateful for public transportation began confessing their first bus rides to strangers as if absolution were a trending topic. “Open all doors” was chalked onto schoolyard concrete in a handwriting that belonged to someone who had learned to run from dogs, and drivers on half the lines of the city gave back three seconds of their lives at every stop without asking who should pay them for it.

They had kept the children. Not for long, not as a rule, but the police wanted to count them as evidence, and evidence turns sour in rooms without windows. Doña Paulina set up cots in the laundry where the sheets steamed like ex-votos, and the girls from the edge of the room with their excellent heels slipped out of their dresses and into aprons and nursed six small bodies with soup, with mango cut ugly and sweet, with the kind of gossip that coats a scared heart in something sticky enough to buy an hour of sleep. In the morning, Taita walked two of the children home through a path of faces and took a half-spoken threat from a man who wore a jacket with fury stitched into the lining; he folded the threat into his pocket and handed it back with a piece of paper bearing a number that would answer after midnight. The other four had no one waiting at a door with a towel. They had aunties with work until eleven, grandmothers with legs that had retired during a carnival, teachers who could say three names of saints with a mouth full of pins. The seamstress requisitioned a corner of the hall for their kingdom and made paper crowns that didn’t say princess but did say owner, and for one day the idea of custody did not belong to anyone with a printer.

The Council called. The Council always called. Don Mateo made sentences that sounded like receipts: the Ministry would like to coordinate the messaging; the Foundation regretted unforeseen disorder; the donors were sensitive; the Energy portfolio could be jeopardized. Luzia let him finish because you have to respect ritual even if you plan to deny it. She was standing on her balcony watching a bus exhale a line of mothers and men who had adopted their grandfathers’ hats, and her city-sense was calling from the bottom of her feet like a phone buzzing in a pocket. “You promised her a stage,” she said, and he flinched audibly. “You promised her the air. We put doors in it. Thank me when you’re writing your memoir and you want to be the kind of man who admits he didn’t understand everything.”

He came back with his own ritual, another men-of-ties thing: an invitation to lunch somewhere where fish pretend not to be expensive. She refused politely because she did not want to hear the silverware agree with him. When he hung up, the radio that only played birds ticked over from a wren to something with a chest too proud for a city this size, and she remembered the seamstress’s split needle wrapped in paper. You cannot stitch a crack with air alone. You need people who know what pulls.

Yara’s feeds were a map of rage and relief and theory. Overnight she had cut together three angles of the ballroom and layered the sound of doors opening under the birdcalls until the clip became an earworm. She had also stolen, gently and with love, the internal communiqué from the transit authority about Nieves-Concordia and blistered it with annotations in red so it bled. Her cousin had sent a photograph of a white van with a black sticker you wouldn’t notice unless you had once spent a summer counting vans, and the number on the plate had humiliated a database enough to admit that it belonged to a contractor who repaired cameras. “She’s going to go daylight,” Yara said without turning around as she typed jazz into something without music. “Vans that fix cameras mean cameras that look away while the sun watches. She’s moving now. She learned what we can do with doors, and she will pick a place with no doors at all and say, show me your little tricks, then.”

“You think bridge,” Jimena said. She had slept with one of the napkins under her cheek and woke with a faint square printed across her face like a stamp of citizenship. “Or market. The places that pretend to be outside and inside at once. I vote market because it makes for better speeches. Bridges are for boys.”

“Bridges are for girls,” Luzia said. “We know what it is to cross and cry and not drop the grocery bag.” She had already laced her shoes. She wanted to walk the city before it decided which friend it wanted to gossip about.

They went to La Perseverancia because hunger is as good a divination as entrails. The morning there smelled like bones boiled with honesty and like the steam that comes off when onions give up. The woman who sold broth under a sign that had once had more letters looked over her spoon and tilted her head at the sight of their faces as if counting the new bruises. “You danced,” she said. “Don’t be shy. I don’t mean with your feet.” She ladled them dignity in bowls and slid a basket of arepas close enough to be a blessing. “She sends boys,” the woman said as if discussing a supplier. “Boys with hats and with hands like shoes. They stand just where the camera sees their good side. They say there will be candy. Yesterday one of them looked like my nephew and I asked him straight, do you need money. He said, I need my mother to stop crying when she thinks I’m asleep. We have no product for that, princesa.”

“The product is doors,” Jimena said promptly. “We are very innovative. We open them and people breathe and everyone loves us until they realize breathing makes workers think.”

“Workers think,” the woman said dryly. “You’ll be burned for such talk. Be burned here. We have water and a hose.”

The boy with the too-big hat came in as if the market were a church he had been told to mock and couldn’t. He pretended he hadn’t seen them and then did the math and decided the price of pretending was too high today. He slipped into a chair backwards and put his chin on the top of it. “She is angry,” he said, as if confessing an unpaid debt. “She told us last night that you cheated. She said air is not fair. She said I should bring her a pink flower because I made a mistake with blue and we should fix it.” He dug in his pocket with the deliberation of a thief and brought out a wrapper folded into a bird. The bird was not from here. The colors were wrong. The printing had that international arrogance that assumes you will recognize it whether or not it has earned the right. He set it on the table and refused to look at it as if it belonged to a dog that bit. “She likes these,” he said. “She said I could keep the bird if I came back with ten. I went to the store with the man with the tattoo of Jesus smoking a cigarette and he said we don’t stock candy that talks in that language.”

Luzia unfolded the bird with careful fingers. The paper was thin as a lie and slick as a promise. It smelled, coyly, of fruit that had never met a season. The letters were a script she didn’t speak but recognized for its expensive indifference to particularity. She pressed it to her tongue and felt a chemical ambition she associated with airports. “Where did you get this,” she asked without looking at him because sometimes children answer better if you ask the salt shaker.

“In a party bag that was not for me,” he said, then swallowed once, then twice. “At the hotel where the rich people liked the view. They set out a box with the kind of teeth that close and told the ladies not to take too many. The ladies took too many. A girl who works nights took two and gave one to my sister when she was looking at the fountain. The girl told me to run. I ran. She didn’t. Men in black made her stand with her hands behind the way they do when they want to tell your mother they are tired of mothers.”

Yara’s eyes had grown very still, which is what happens to a predator before it pounces and what happens to a woman who has learned new information she will use like a key. “The hotel,” she said, and named it correctly on the first try because it is the one with a view men like to throw their guilt off. “We’ll need a list of shipments. We’ll need the supplier that wasn’t there yesterday. We’ll need the man at the dock who thinks candy is a category.”

“The hotel will give you nothing,” Taita said, not because he believed in helplessness but because he believed in budgets. “It is built for privacy. The deliveries come with the linens and the trash leaves with secrets. You will be invited for cocktails by someone who wants to fall in love with your teeth and you will leave with a napkin.”

“I have a room there,” Jimena said blandly, because she had managed to turn occasional cat-sitting into a profession. Three rich women had learned to leave her a key when they fled their husbands and a fourth had decided to confess nothing. “Or my friend Salome does, which is the same thing. We can count candy with their towels.”

Luzia slid the bird into her pocket with the handkerchief and the flyer about tile floors. She could feel the papery stiff differences like rivals in her lining. She looked at the boy and said, “You want to be brave today. I have work for you which is not delivering gifts to a woman who makes your sisters invisible. You will take this” — she slid a small tin across the table like a magician refusing to use a dove — “to the man with the tattoo of Jesus smoking. He will give you a name. That name belongs to a woman at the florist’s son’s school who delivers eggs. You will walk with her and you will carry the heavy side of her basket and you will listen to the names she says because she says them like someone filing. You will not get paid today. You will be paid Friday because you will come back. If you don’t like the work, you will tell me and I will find other work because you are not allowed to be the kind of boy who thinks work is not for him because he is clever with bicycles.”

He looked straight at her for the first time because he didn’t understand whether he had been insulted and wanted to decide whether to be jealous of men who understood such things. Then he nodded once like a dog learning its leash was worth its meat, and took the tin without looking inside at the money wrapped in a band that said a grandmother’s name. “Can I paint my own name,” he said abruptly, as if remembering he had once been small enough to ask for things without trade. “At the stop. It is ugly. It looks like a shoe stepping on it. I want to paint it so big that if I disappear they will have to leave the house because my name won’t fit and I will be outside where they can see me.”

“You can paint it,” Jimena said. “And you can paint over it if you ever decide you want to be called by something else. That’s what grownups do when they’ve had too many names.”

He left with his hat unconvincing and his bike convinced, and the broth woman refilled their bowls with a shove that pretended to be accident. “The mountain will be watching you tonight,” she said as if it were weather. “Make the mountain laugh. She sulks when she doesn’t laugh. Sulking mountains make for bad soup.”

At noon the hydrangeas in three public planters turned the color of sky over an ocean that did not want guests. It happened quickly, a chemical tempering like envy, and the old men who played dominoes under their mild shade stopped and stared and then, with the practicality of men who had once had guns in their kitchens, moved their game to another bench. Mothers stopped, sighed, took pictures, and went on because a day can only bear so many emergencies. Yara posted the locations and watched the comments multiply in categories she could have predicted: the aesthetic, the apocalyptic, the agricultural. Hidden among them was a message that was not addressed to her: a string of numbers that, if read on the old radio, would spell nothing except to a woman who listened to birds and vents. She listened. The static shivered and resolved into a voice without breath, a thread of sound, sachet-sweet. “Do not trick me with plants,” Malena said somewhere between hiss and rumor. “You can make pink from blue. You cannot make salt sweet. Do not be late.”

“How considerate,” Jimena said. She had stolen pastries from a bakery whose owner loved her mother and held them like ammunition. “She sends reminders so you can put on lipstick.”

“She is telling us her clock,” Taita said. He pulled a chair over the floorplan of the hotel that Yara had stolen with charm and code and planted it on a coffee stain as if that were an anchor. “If she is moving candy like a psalm, if she is practicing with children like an orchestra before a premiere, if she is flirting with water in a room built to resist men’s sweat, then she will walk through the kitchen because that is where the city keeps its spines. Jimena, you will go in as a cat and become a woman if you have to. Yara, you will open every stupid computer that thinks it is a lock. Luzia, you will stand where there is no door and watch for one to be invented.”

The hotel tried to act as if it had never been named in a curse. Its lobby did that falseness that money loves: nothing smelled like anything except the idea of citrus. There was a bowl of candies by the check-in that did not include the wrapper-bird. The man behind the desk had eyes that had learned the trick of seeing a princess and letting the mouth remain neutral. Salome’s key liked Jimena better than it liked honesty, and the elevator coughed them up into a hallway that made your footsteps pretend they were softer. In the room, they stood for a minute and let the place do its work. Expensive rooms want you to think about decisions. They make you nostalgic for what you could have done with the money that bought this rug for a day.

Yara went on her knees to the dumb waiter, because sometimes the oldest doors are the ones that didn’t update their credentials, and she opened the panel with a sigh that the building mistook for praise. It smelled of apple carts and cigarettes and mint from a kitchen where someone had killed their breath out of respect for a girlfriend. She climbed into the square because she has the kind of bones that had never liked a desk and dropped two floors into a space she would have called a throat if she had been writing about it later. In the kitchen, women in hats that made them look like cleaned-up saints placed trays on tables with the economy of fighter pilots, and the pastry chef sang to herself in Portuguese the way you sing to a child when you know the child is actually a volcano.

Jimena went down the hall and found the service door and leaned against it as if she had always belonged with the lineage of a thousand leaning women before her. When a man with a clipboard looked up to tell her she couldn’t, she smiled the smile that had been made to make men reconsider their rules, and when he told her it was not a place for guests, she said she was not a guest, she was an apology, and he let her through because apologies, when they are dressed correctly, are convincing. She walked the path a dishwasher uses when he scouts for places to smoke and found the storage where boxes that had once been chocolate lay open-mouthed. She found the foreign wrappers in a bag inside a bag inside a bag and she put ten into her pocket and left ten when she wanted to take all of them because she is also a woman who knows that leaving bait is sometimes a kindness.

Luzia watched without moving in a spot where the weight of footfalls never made the carpet groan because she did not want the building to learn her step. She watched the lobby while pretending to admire the way the chairs had been taught to forgive anyone who sat in them. She watched the men with plates of cheese shaped like islands, the women with dogs that had pillows, the florist’s boy carrying an armful of baby’s breath with a face that said it did not know what babies had to do with anything. She watched the elevator doors too long and grew bored of herself and finally gave in to the habit she had sworn to break and touched, just with her fingers, the seam where the marble met the wood. The smell of the wrapper-bird had settled deep—someone had tried to clean it and failed because cleaning is not forgetting—and under it she found a cleaner thing. She found salt, yes, but the good salt, the kind that speaks of kitchens and alder-smoked fish, not the kind that lives in throat wounds. She followed it down mentally and it took her to the cold room, to a shelf where someone had once set a bucket of brine from a market in a port, and from there to a car that had been a freezer and to a boy in a hairnet who needed to call his mother and didn’t.

In the photograph they didn’t take, the lift opened and she saw herself reflected in a door with an underbite. In the photograph they didn’t take, the woman in white stepped from the elevator with a basket that looked like something a half-sister would take to church in a small town where everyone pretended to have slept. In reality, she came with a flat-knuckled woman pushing a cart of identical boxes and three men whose necks had not learned how to be still. The smell came not from the basket, which held flowers that had decided individually to misbehave, but from the seam along the hem, from a strip of cloth under the lace that had been washed in a sink the hotel would deny existed. She moved across the lobby without stirring dust and the flowers on the table nearest the door died very gently so everyone would have something to talk about in the evening.

“Do you like candy,” she asked the doorman pleasantly, and the young man, who had learned to ride the horse of this job without losing his temper, said that he had given up sugar because it made him sad. She smiled and left without forcing him to be wrong. The door closed behind her and Yara came up in the dumb waiter with a laugh trapped in her throat. She had been invisible to the pastry chef and had seen the wrapper-bird folded into twenty birds; she had watched a girl with a bruise in the shape of a man’s ring tuck one into an apron and she had wanted to scream because she knew the act had been both survival and an invitation. She had left a camera in a jar labeled basil because she wanted to watch the hotel forget and remember itself.

Jimena joined them with her pockets noisy. She emptied them on the carpet the way a magician might, and the birds unfolded into a flock of companies who had signed no contract with the city. Each one smelled faintly of shores. “She puts these in boxes with shoes,” Jimena said softly. “Not for children. For women. Women whose heels could kill you. She is making them a kind of communion. The bag under the bag under the bag—someone sewed it from a shirt. The stitches are sad. The armpits still remember the man who wore it. His sweat makes the ink on the label run.”

“She is building an army that is not men,” Taita said from behind them, and there was something like pride and something like horror in his voice because he had a daughter once and he had learned the economy of that sentence. “But she cannot feed them without making us do accounting. We will make it expensive to give free candy. We will make it complicated to bring it in a freezer. We will make the flower boy’s walk to the elevator take longer.”

By afternoon, the hydrangeas had turned in five more plazas and the aunties in those neighborhoods had turned the soil with spoons they did not mean to break. The florist filmed a little lesson in her cooler with her lips painted in a way that scolded the camera; she taught how to tip a pH without making a plant suspect you of treachery, and she told the city, “We are not helpless. Soil is opinion, not destiny.” The transit authority issued a statement that said painting bus shelters is vandalism and that there would be no tolerance for names where maps should be. The drivers wrote names on their route sheets like tattoos. The boy with the hat painted his name enormous and wrong, and a cop watching laughed and then coughed and then helped hold the ladder because it was the sort of day that could ruin a man’s uniform if he wasn’t careful.

The seamstress came late, as she had promised, her hair like the tail of a comet that has learned to descend on schedule. She carried a box that had been a box for wedding cake once and set it on Luzia’s table and did not open it. “I sewed this with thread that knows three kinds of water,” she said. “River, mountain, ocean. It will insult two of them and flatter the third, and I do not know in what order. Do not let a man touch it if he thinks he owns any of those waters. Make a circle with it. When she tries to hum, put your circle down outside her song. She will sing to herself for once.”

Inside, when they lifted the lid together, lay a rope of cloth, black and slate and a little green, braided with hair and ribbon and something that had the texture of the inside of a seed pod. It smelled faintly of sprig and of rust and of the first day of school. It had charms tied into it at drunk-looking intervals. It felt heavier than it looked, like a promise that costs.

“How much do we pay you,” Yara said, because she respects economics almost as much as she hates it.

“You pay me by arriving on time,” the seamstress said, and spat once into a tall glass with the formality of an oath. “And by telling the mountain a story it has not heard. You pay me by visiting my granddaughter with magazines that have pictures of hair and using those pictures for spelling lessons because she likes the names of styles better than she likes the names of saints. You will bring milk that does not cost a prince.”

The mountain told its own story before dinner was done. A bus on the route that pretended to be Nieves-Concordia stopped at a light and the asphalt decided to sink like a chair admitting someone heavy had sat on it. The bus listed but did not fall and everyone on it said their particular kind of Our Father. Two blocks away a pipe that had been a gentleman its whole life burst into a confession against a wall and wrote a long sentence that would have been obscene in daylight. The boy with the violin stepped back from where he had set his case and lifted his instrument and began to play a tune that sounded like somebody walking backwards carefully through their own kitchen. A woman on a fifth-floor balcony took in laundry with a speed that argued history. The city adjusted its weight and smiled at nobody and bared its teeth at the mountain like a dog warning a larger animal that it is not alone.

They carried the coil that the seamstress had made like pallbearers carry a small saint. The hotel would not be the scene because the hotel belonged to men who would pretend later they had no eyes. Malena loved public more than private because private is a language built for mercy, so they went to the plaza where the new sign would live in a week and found it already swaddled in black again because bureaucracy is a mother that forgets what she has already fed. The night was the right temperature for courage, a degree shy of comfort. The buses opened their doors and sighed and shut and opened again in a rhythm that would have been music without requiring a band. People leaned in to see what was being dragged and stepped back in the old choreography that keeps toes attached.

“Do you think she comes,” Jimena asked as she took one end of the braid and tucked it over her arm as if it were a shawl. “Or does she send a scent and let us make a fool’s circle and then laugh into her mouth with a man whose wife is wearing hydrangeas?”

“She is early when we are late,” Luzia said. “She is always late when we are early. We must confuse her as if she were a cat and we have learned what color string she will chase. We do not chase. We tie.”

They laid the rope on the ground in a ring that was not perfect, because why flatter geometry, and fed its end through itself so that it pulled like a living thing. The seamstress tied three knots with hands you would have thought belonged to a woman born in a rural century and in each knot she said, not loudly, names that might once have belonged to girls who had jumped rope. As she tightened the third, there was a sound as if a glass somewhere far away had quietly decided to crack. People stepped back not because of that sound, which they did not hear, but because the air had shifted its weight and the hydrangeas at the edge of the plaza went pinker. Yara set the bird radio on the rim as if it were a stone, and it chirped like something domestic that remembers a forest.

She came like the smell of a summer closet—that mildew that says you have forgotten to open a door. She wore white because she is not an innovator in costume, and she carried no basket today, because she had learned that baskets make her tender. Her eyes slid over the rope as if refusing to be flattered by something hand-made, and then she stopped because she is not an idiot. She touched the air above the circle and the braid tugged itself tighter like a belt on a breath. The crowd, which pretended not to be a crowd, leaned like grass when a dog runs past. “A child’s trick,” she said, and then with that slyness that makes even saints smile, “A mother’s trick. I have never been a mother. It is rude of me to say so out loud.”

“You do not have to be to learn what keeps a body in and another out,” the seamstress said, which in her mouth did not sound like an insult and was.

Malena moved to step over and the rope refused to admit the movement. The coil lifted a little like an eyebrow and her calf met resistance that looked like air but felt like a wet dog deciding whether to let you pass. She laughed, genuinely, the way a girl laughs the first time she learns a game she thought beneath her is in fact delicious. “You ask me to sing to myself,” she said. “How quaint. I never perform for fewer than ten throats at once.”

“Then consider us the worst audience,” Yara said. She had her hands on the bus door because she loved objects too much, and the door hummed because it wanted to be helpful. “We will not applaud. We will not buy candy. We brought vinegar.”

“Always with the cleaning,” Malena said, almost pleased. “Men think war is powder and women think war is of course we will be laundering until dawn. This is why I choose cities for companies. Men will always applaud; women will always stay late. What will you do when I begin taking water from men’s abdominal cavities instead of floors?”

“Ask for a towel,” Jimena said, spiking her hair with a useless comb like a crown. “And a mop. Do you want a opera or do you want to get to the point? We have all worked today.”

The circle held like a grandmother’s advice. Malena paced it once, twice, the way a cat tests exactly what you’re capable of, and on the third rotation she stopped and closed her eyes as if the day had been noisy. She hummed, soft, not an assault but a needle, and on the far side of the ring, in the dark between two bins where men ate sandwiches at four in the morning, water beads began to form on the concrete. They grew like pearls of sweat on the lip of a sick person. Three rolled into each other and made a bigger drop, and the bigger drop slid along a fault that no one had known existed. “That’s mine,” she said softly, and tilted her chin and the drop stopped because the rope sulked and would not let it think the plaza was a kitchen floor.

For a hot second Luzia saw exactly what kind of dance this would become if they did not cheat. It would decide itself along the old lines between what can be called sinister and what can be called sanitation. She thought of the boy who had wanted to paint his name so large there would be no room for him inside it, and she stepped into the circle not because she wanted to be brave but because circles are only useful if someone is inside them. The seamstress hissed in a language that had no s’s and lots of m’s and then nodded because if you do not bleed inside your own charms they turn on you later and charge interest.

“Your body stinks of air,” Malena murmured, half-delighted. “You have given up so much salt to the men you dance with. You have taught the mountain to think you are her daughter. Do not bring daughters to bother me. Bring me princes with flags and I will teach them to scream properly.”

“I don’t keep princes,” Luzia said. “They scratch the furniture.” She lifted the handkerchief and held it between two fingers in the air that separated their noses by three feet and a history. The cloth fluttered once toward the rope as if to ask permission to proceed and then settled to neutrality; it liked no one, which made it public property in the best sense.

They stood in their insult of a ring and opened all the doors they could reach and listened to birds and watched water put itself down like a baby being convinced to nap, and the people who passed pretended to be indifferent the way a woman pretends to be indifferent to her own beauty in a mirror. There is a kind of battle that looks like bad theatre to outsiders, and there is a kind of theatre that is the only way for women to make war in a city that loves to ask for blood and hates to see it. This was both. The boy with the hat stood with his bicycle between his knees like a priest with a lectern and watched the way people watched the first television in their barrio, and when Jimena asked him later what he had seen, he said, “A fight where nobody hits,” and then his ears went red because he thought it made him sound like a boy.

The rain came at last, not in a torrent, but in that fine-fingered way Bogotá likes, the mist that makes it hard to tell which parts of you are inside and which are out. The rope drank it like gossip and grew heavier, satisfied. Malena opened her eyes and did not look tired because she has never allowed herself the luxury. “You will be late tomorrow,” she said, a little too quickly. “You will be busy returning children you think you saved to men who know where doors are supposed to be.” She glanced once toward the hill as if remembering she disliked it and then toward the hotel as if remembering she owned its smell. “I will bring boats,” she added, hushed almost in deference to the seamstress who had bound her small, and then she smiled, an expression so lovely that if she had asked anyone in that radius to go to the river and drown there would have been volunteers.

“You will bring them to a place that hates to float,” Luzia said, not because she had a prophecy but because she had been a girl in a city with drains and had learned where they refused to be found. “Bring them to the market if you want shouting, to the bridge if you want men to pretend to be heroes, to the school if you want to be forgiven. Or bring them to my house,” she added on impulse she usually cut at the knees, “if you want me to show you what a door does when nobody asks permission to pass it. It holds.”

She left then because leaving is a weapon if you have the timing for it. The rope relaxed with a sigh like a shirt unbuttoned. The hydrangeas missed their chance to be saints for once and went back to being pretty. People went home trailing steam and arguments. A driver leaned his forehead against the cool of his bus and whispered a name that he did not know he had memorized as if it were a number. The mountain, patient as grandmothers, squinted into the plaza through the fog and considered, not without respect, the little ring on the ground that had kept a tide in its mouth and not swallowed.

That night, Luzia could not sleep, and when she could not sleep she did not lie still and think herself into a headache. She walked. She left Taita dozing in the chair like the sort of man who could wake up ready to run and she left Yara arguing with ghosts inside her machine and she left Jimena with a phone balanced on her stomach playing a song about a girl who did not want a boy and a boy who could not cope. The streets were medium empty, the kind of empty that means you know the names of most of the shadows. She went to the river that no tourist bothers with because it does not look like a postcard and it does not try to. She stood on the footbridge that liked to be called by a saint’s name and put her hand on the rail and listened to water like an eavesdropper.

It told her nothing new. That is the problem with water. It hears everything but it is loyal to the last story told. She leaned over it until the rain found the back of her neck the way a mother finds a collar and pushed up her sleeve and saw that the raven the seamstress had pinned near her hip had bled a little dye into the dress. She licked the spot and laughed at herself because she felt sixteen in that moment, which is not flattering when you are as tired as she was. She looked downriver and she saw, for a sting of a heartbeat, boat shapes. Not real. Shadows. But the river—mean little river, sweet little river—had understood the word. She closed her eyes and counted doors, one, two, three, four, until the counting stopped being a spell and became a rhythm you could walk to in shoes that weren’t built for it.

In the morning, the boy with the hat brought news with his eggs. The girl who had given his sister the wrapper-bird had not been at her corner. Two men had stood there and asked if anyone wanted candy and the aunties had laughed and the men had left without embarrassing themselves because they were new to this country. The hydrangeas in the plaza by the old aqueduct had turned not pink or blue but a strange color like the bruise on a kneecap three days old. The driver with the comma-scar had come to the stop early and left late without being told and his mother had called him a hero in a whisper and made him wash the word off his neck with soap. The seamstress had sent milk. The mountain had sent fog. Malena had sent a handkerchief folded into a shape like a boat and when Luzia unfolded it over the stove steam rose off the cloth as if it had been dipped in a kettle and there, in the wet, appeared writing that did not belong to any country that would outlive its own bridges.

She held the cloth up to the window so the light would be mean to it and read a message that had been written in a letter without vowels. It said: Bring me home. It said: Call me by my wrong name. It said: Count your doors. It said the same thing it always said, but with a new crease, a new insistence, a new hunger. It made her angry because it made her feel like a character in someone else’s play. She folded it again and tucked it where the raven could lean its beak and said to the tiles in her kitchen, “We will make you grow grass. And then we will make her mow it.”
