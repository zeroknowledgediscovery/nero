The winter wind in Saint Paul likes to fold itself into corners and wait. It wait in the alleyways that have names on no maps and under the bridge where the river freezes in skins and breaks them with a sigh. It wait in my vents, sometimes, when I sleep on the springs of the couch because the bed is too honest about what it is. A couch will lie. A bed never can. That’s one of the things I learned from this city.

That and locks. Hinges, too. Hinges have bad dreams when they’re left out in the snow, and you can hear them worry if you press an ear to the right part of the knee and breathe through your teeth so the breath doesn’t fog the brass. There are a hundred things like that. I keep a list in my head and a list in my drawer and a list scratched into the underside of the kitchen table. If you turned the table over you’d see it: ways to know a thing before the thing knows you. How to follow the whisper of underground steam like you’d follow a tune. How to hear a lost house key in the pocket of a drunk three floors up when he’s swearing at the radiator like it’s a priest. How to make yourself the same size as a coin so the bartender never sees you taking one more second than you paid for.

People call them skills. I call them politeness. I have a particular set of politenesses. I’m a goblin. We don’t take up much space, not the same volume as a person expects when they say excuse me and try to shoulder past on the sidewalk with their coffee and the sleeve of their coat brushing your cheek by accident. We fit under things and beside things, between the numbers at the top of the page and the words at the bottom. You either learn to fit or you learn to be trampled. That, too, is Saint Paul.

My name is Merrin Palgrave because someone thought it would be funny, once, to give me the stump of a saint for the first half and a street for the second. Palgrave, like there’s a grave in the name. Merrin, like merriment, which in our tongue means something else entirely, something like the way frost moves across a window when you exhale on the glass and draw your initials. I sign my initials a lot. Jobs like mine need signing, after, so folks don’t lose their nerve and pretend the help never helped at all.

I live above a bicycle repair shop on Selby that closes when it snows because bike dreams rot in February. The shop owner, Jao, leaves me a coffee on Thursdays and a broken bell on Sundays. We have a friendship built on salvage. There are plastic tubs under my bed with rubber bands, screws, washers, things I might need someday and things I will never need because you keep a few of those too. The floor slopes toward the river and if I drop a marble I can time the season by how long it takes to reach the crack under the door and vanish.

On the first day of the story—a story chooses where it begins; I usually would not pin it exactly—there was a woman crying over a goldfish. It wasn’t just any woman and not just any fish and not that kind of crying. She cried like she didn’t want to get caught doing it, and yes, there is a difference. She wore a coat that made me think of the Cathedral standing cold and bright on the hill, all composed lines and quiet. Her name was Lucy Sund, and she taught chemistry at the university in the long building with the giant windows that reflect the sky like a want they don’t know how to admit.

“Come in,” I said. I have a doorbell that sounds like a bottle cap being twisted slowly off a top. If it rings twice I don’t open the door. Superstition? You won’t catch me in a room with two clocks, either.

She stepped over the threshold and took in the space in a glance. Goblins watch how you look at their dens. It tells you how someone reads a room. They see the map on the wall, the cracked leather chair, the pigeon feather stuck behind the mirror, and you see if their eyes catalog or if they swerve. Lucy Sund cataloged. Her eyes were steady and dry by the time she reached the chair, and she sat without touching the arms, which I liked because the arms have a tack to them in winter from the glue that the upholstery has forgotten only halfway.

“You’re Merrin,” she said. “They call you Merrin the key.”

“I’ve been called worse.” I put the kettle on the minute she entered. A kettle has a god in it. If you’ve never heard steam argue with metal then you haven’t had interesting friends. “Tea? It’s violet. It tastes like sweets and headaches.”

“Water,” she said. “Or coffee if you have the faith for it.”

“I rarely do. Water, then.” I passed her a glass. She held it in both hands as if she was in a church and it was something blessed. It wasn’t. I’d scrubbed the rust off the sink a few days ago. The world comes off if you scratch it hard enough.

“I’m told you find things that are not lost,” she said.

“Most things aren’t,” I said. “They’re put down. They go to see how far they can go before their owners notice. And if they don’t come back, it’s not on the things.”

“My goldfish didn’t come back,” she said, and then there was the breath she took that had the shape of a cry and was not one. “I have a pond in the atrium. It isn’t a big thing. Ten fish when I went to bed. The door locked. It always is. In the morning, there were nine. Then eight.”

“Cats,” I said.

“I know cats,” she said with a stiffness that meant she’d worked out cusps and curves all day and had no patience for fuzzy riddles. “They leave signs. Wet paws on tile. Scales on the stairs. The water clouded with panic. This is clean. This is careful. It is deliberate. And it is wrong.”

“I like a woman with a good sense of wrong.” I fetched a pad and a stub of pencil. I don’t keep pencils with erasers. It makes people reckless. “Someone stole your goldfish.”

She touched the rim of the glass with her finger. “They didn’t just steal them,” she said, looking down into the water as if there were colors there that would permit precise speech. “They ate them.”

Saint Paul is a practical city. It is a city that believes in snow parking on alternate sides and in church basements with casseroles that have a theology of their own. It is a city that nods when I say I’m a goblin and nods again as if that explains my rent and disposition. It is not, generally speaking, a city that believes there are goblins who eat goldfish. Not in the Colonial sense. Not in the sense that an action becomes a habit becomes a man becomes a legend.

“It’s not a metaphor,” Lucy said, as if she’d read my list of ways people weasel around a fact they don’t like. “I found a tooth.”

She took a small object wrapped in tissue from her pocket and set it on the table. I glanced at it and looked away. You don’t look at sharp things straight-on. That’s another politeness. The tooth was a pale half-moon with a notch. Not human. Certainly not cat. I smelled pond water, the fern spice of the atrium plants, the faint metallic of a building’s sigh. The tooth was real. It had been in a mouth recently. My own teeth complained in sympathy, a sloppy ache.

“You teach chemistry,” I said. “And you keep a pond.”

“We all have our controlled reactions,” she said. “Mine involve orange fish and students who don’t understand that acids have feelings. I want you to find who is doing this. I want you to tell them to stop.”

“People who do such things rarely stop when asked,” I said.

“Then ask twice,” she said. “Ask three times. I’ll pay.”

“Paying helps with the asking.” I named an amount that made her eyebrows jump but not in a way that said she would leave. She agreed with a nod. We shook on it. Goblin handshakes are spine-straightening. Her grip was strong and cold and grateful.

“Take me there,” I said. “Before the wind changes. The wind has a way of smudging the crime scenes.”

We walked. The world was dark like an earthen cup. The moon wore a scarf thin as a thread. She set a pace that took me two steps to her one, which added up to conversation that arrived in pulses. The city changed underfoot as we crossed it. Mac-Groveland’s well-behaved sidewalks turned into the confident stalk of Summit and then the truer stories of Lowertown, where buildings confess to a past and the windows are often dressed in an old name that clings like perfume.

The atrium was in a building with a name like coordinates. Letters and numbers that meant something to donors and to a map that had too many edges. In the glass, night was darker than night. Lucy keyed the lock. No smudges on the panel. I checked the handle for conversation and found it had none; it wasn’t flirted with, torn by an unkind key, forced by a man with love and a crowbar. Whatever came here came with permission or with permission’s twin.

Inside, the air was humid and quiet. Plants angled. Plants always know where the rain is. The pond was an oval mouth in the floor, ringed with stones that had weekly conversations with kneeling hands. There were seven fish under the surface, each a slip of lantern light. My breath left small fingerprints on the glass of the room. Frost had reached for the edges and stopped, puzzled.

“Ten, then nine, then eight,” I said under my breath. She nodded.

“Now seven. I counted before we came. I count every time.”

“People count when they are preparing to be betrayed,” I said.

She made a sound that you hear when students break the only beaker you can’t replace. “Who would do this?”

Goblins who eat goldfish, I thought. I had heard of one. There was a name we did not say for him because names coax presence. He had a taste for koi in Como Park, for the glittering ones that float like monks in their saffron quiet. He had a taste for bowl fish and backyard fish and the tin flakes of dreams that children gave names and tulip tails. He had a taste and a story that followed the taste like a night train. He ate what everyone else thought was ornamental, which is to say, safe.

I knelt near the pond. The stones were damp. There were the faint sighs of algae and filtering. There was a thread of something else, too—something like the smell of coins rubbed hard between fingers and the clean cold of winter copper. I looked under the lip of the stone rim and found a scale dried to it by a drop of water. Not one of the seven. Older. Fish scales tell the future to those who grow up in places where low ceilings make you duck every day. This one said: a mouth came down gentle as a priest’s hand on a head. No splash. A snatch done with appreciation. And a tooth, yes, because the mouth had laughed at itself and scraped the stone. Vanity does that.

“He likes the taste of the place,” I said, and Lucy made herself wait to ask what that meant.

“Who?”

“He is a goblin,” I said, and there went the blink. The way humans do when the word lands. Most folks don’t believe there are sorts of goblins. Like pen knives, we are supposed to be small and general and always either useful or dangerous depending on who tells the story. I stood and rubbed my hands to get the pond’s chill out of my bone. “I can find him,” I said.

“And tell him to stop,” she said.

“I will try to be polite about it,” I said.

She watched me for a long breath. “When do you start?”

“I started when I smelled coins.” I turned and checked the other entrances with my eye. There was a short door with a maintenance sign and a men’s room that would be a woman’s if they needed it to be and a third door that had been painted recently in a color that wanted to be called durable. The maintenance door had a lock that could be loved into opening. The paint would say something under your fingernail. Locks, paint, hinges, the list ran under my breath.

At the maintenance door I pressed and the door pressed back. Overused, undertold. The key scratches at the handle were small and precise and recent. The janitor would savor his order; this was not his work. Someone else had the key or the key’s smile.

Lucy stood close enough that I could feel her sleeve catch my coat at the elbow. “Do you need me to—”

“If I do, I’ll say,” I said. “People bargain when you don’t say and then you look up and you’re cleaning someone else’s kitchen for the price of a story you didn’t want to hear.”

“You sound like my mother,” she said. “She believed in paying the right price.”

“She must be a saint,” I said, and heard the way my voice went odd on the word. Saint. I am from Saint Paul, yes. We live under its wooden bridges and behind its old paper walls and in the mews made for horses and in the span under the railroad where you can stand and feel the whole map thrum. The city is a saint the way saints are when people forget to dust their statues. There’s always a halo of something.

I could have picked the lock on the maintenance door wearing mittens with my eyes closed and half a song stuck crosswise in my head. It took me six heartbeats. Inside, the corridor ran away under white pipes. Pipes that told me their dates and their grudges. There was a room where rags slept and a room where a mop smelled like a dock in July. There was a ragged square where a latch had been filed thinner by someone who believed in shortcuts.

We followed the corridor, then took a yellow stair down to the shadow where the building admitted it had more secret than structure. The basement had been poured in a mood. It had bad corners and a penchant for weird echoes. We sidled past a huddle of old chairs and boxes with labels that promised they would remember later, and reached a door heavy enough to hold heat. I felt the wind under it. Not outside wind. A wind that comes from a thing moving through.

“Here,” I said, and pressed my ear to it. Behind it, a sound like a mouth drinking and chewing the hush. There is a word for that sound in my grandmother’s tongue. It means something like: he’s doing it again.

“You don’t want to be here for this,” I said to Lucy. “Go back to the atrium. Count again. If there are still seven I’ll show you the trick I use to make sure they’re the same seven.”

She didn’t move. “This is my building.”

“This next part is mine,” I said, and didn’t say please because sometimes please is a leash and sometimes it is a lie and sometimes it is the thing that drags you after like a tin can behind a wedding car. I looked at her in the way that goblins look when we need the favor to be real. She nodded and went up the stairs, her steps like percentages.

I eased the door open. It sighed. The sigh was answered by a chuckle that came straight back into my face. The air was wet and thin. On the other side of the heavy door was a narrower corridor and an older one; it slid along the belly of the building like a thought someone had had and then turned away from. And in that corridor, walking with the slouch of someone who is one dog shorter than his leash, was a goblin I knew of and had never met.

He wasn’t large. Goblins rarely are. He had pallor that made him look bathed in winter, and hair that had made enemies with combs and left the room before anyone else. He wore a coat that had belonged to a grandfather or a story. He walked with the rhythm of someone who measures his own appetite when he measures his steps. He held in his left hand something wet and orange and limp and in his right he held nothing, which in this case was more frightening. I smelled the ghost of pond water and the easy pride that some criminals mistake for intelligence. He turned his head and looked at me and smiled with the wrong half of his mouth.

“You have a problem,” he said. His voice was like something you found behind a radiator.

“Not the same one you have,” I said. “Yours has its teeth in you.”

“I have a tooth,” he said, and lifted his hand to show me. He had indeed. His mouth lit with the beauty that comes when a man admires his own ruin. “But you know that, Merrin Palgrave. I hear you know everyone’s teeth. It’s why you don’t smile in photographs.”

“Someone’s been telling stories out of school,” I said. “What are we calling you.”

“You know better than to call me,” he said. “You can think it if you like. Think Kettle. Think Kettle who likes the gold. Think Kettle who eats what no one counts. Think Kettle who does not take a thing a man uses to live, no, no, I am an ethicist, I am a soft and scholarly sin. I am the small ruin.”

“Be proud in private,” I said. “Put the fish down.”

His eyes narrowed, stretched. “The professor sent you,” he said, and then laughed. “Professor of what, professor of sighs? She had such a neat coat. She smelled like chalk and too much coffee and the need to pretend she’s fine when she isn’t. A woman after my own heart.”

“You have goldfish breath,” I said. “It suits you less than you think.”

“Everything suits me,” he said cheerfully. He spoke like a man with his hand in a bowl of candy. He lifted a finger smeared with the glitter of scales and sucked it, slow, solemn. “Listen, Palgrave. I know you know enough that you should turn around. You work for the ladies with their lost keys and the men who can’t find their houses because the snow has made the numbers shy. You work in small currencies. You get paid in thanks and cash and sometimes pie. There is no pie here for you.”

“You’re right,” I said. “I ate before I came.”

“Go on then,” he said, and the tenderness in his voice was a thing I used to put a bead of anger on a string in the middle of my chest. “Go back to your strings and keys.”

It wasn’t his mouth that made me angry. It was his arrogance. It was the way he kissed the idea that he wasn’t harming anyone because fish cannot talk and men only weep over a certain kind of loss. It was the way he stood in the private veins of the building like it was a thing with no nerves.

“You’re not the first,” I said, keeping my voice low because the corridor would remember words and repeat them later, when it suited. “I know about Como. I know about a backyard in Highland Park where a boy sat on his porch for three hours waiting for his fish to come back up and they didn’t. I know you like the ones with names.”

“I do,” he said. “Names are salt. Names make the heart burst in your mouth. They make a swallow more—how do you say it?—seasoned. You would know this if you loved things more.”

“I love differently,” I said.

“So go love differently somewhere else.”

I couldn’t throw a punch. That’s not a thing I do, not in corridors where pipes are watching. Besides, he had teeth and a grin and that wet hand and a left shoulder that would duck and my fist would hit brick. But I had other things.

I took a step and said a word. It wasn’t magic. I don’t do magic. It was a word my grandmother used when a fire needed to remember it would not be the last thing to stand upright in the room. It meant: no. Not a command. A boundary. I put the word in the place where his next step would fall.

He felt it when his foot touched the floor and his knee refused to bend the way it always has. He jerked and looked down. The fish slithered. He grabbed it with his right hand by instinct, which was what I wanted, because that tied up both his hands and I was already moving. I ducked low and pressed my shoulder to his rib cage, not to hurt him but to put us both into the space between yes and yes. The corridor gave a creak. He gave a hiss.

“You won’t always be taller,” I said, and he spat a laugh that hit my ear like spit in winter.

“I don’t have to be,” he said, “to live in a better house than you. You think me small time? You think goldfish are practice? We start with ornament, Merrin. We always start there. When I build I won’t have to lay my own brick. I will not cut my finger on a hinge because someone will do hinges for me. You will come knocking at my gate to sell me your dignity for a blanket in one of my rooms.”

“Tell me where you sleep,” I said. “Tell me where you lay the bones of your appetite.”

“Come find the castle,” he said softly, and that was the second time that night a word made my eye twitch in a place you can’t see. “It’s already growing. It has velvet in the walls. Have you seen velvet in walls? It breathes. It is like the inside of a pocket.”

He pushed with a strength that made me recommend to my shoulder that it quit being the important part of me for a while. I stepped back. He took advantage, as all of us will. He dropped the fish into his mouth. It slid down with a sound that made the hair on my arms stand up in a cold wave. He closed his eyes like a man who has just heard a hymn sung properly for the first time in ten years.

I could have run at him then. I could have done something we would both regret. Instead, I took a different politeness out of my pocket. I whistled. A thin, whippy sound that I learned under the railroad on a night when the frost told me that whistles are little keys you don’t need to hold.

The pipes listened. They respect a whistle. The corridor breathed in and then held its breath. The lights made a small disappointment sound and dimmed. For a second we were both in the half-dark, and in the dark every creature thinks of what it was when it was small.

He blinked.

I blinked.

The building chose a side. It was mine. Not for love. For curiosity. Buildings like to see what happens when they tilt the table a little.

Condensation ran down the pipes like a sudden sweat. The floor grew wet. He slipped. He caught himself with both hands. He swore in a language that had nothing to do with human words. The sound made the skin along my spine discuss whether it would return my calls. He glared up at me, his eyes clearing with the sharpness of someone who, for the first time, realizes he will have to work for it.

“Stay out of my rooms,” I said.

“I will make more rooms,” he said. “So many that your keys will get tired. Do you understand? I am not a thief, I am an appetite. I am not an intruder, I am a guest with a full belly and everyone is too polite to say anything. You can muss my collar tonight but I will not be stopped by manners.”

“Then by something else,” I said, because in this town we are patient with everyone until we are not. “Go home. I’ll find you. And when I do, you will put your mouth on better things.”

He laughed again, but it was the kind of laugh that happens at the edge of a cliff where you’ve mismeasured by a toe. He pushed past me. I did not grab. I let him go by the way you let a fire go when you’re guiding it into a fireplace from a carpet with a wet towel. He slouched down the corridor and turned into a stair that should not have been there. The wall swallowed him like a story does when it makes the first turn and no one you’ve met comes back for five chapters.

I stood in the wet. I listened to the building breathe. I put my hand on the pipe that had done me a favor, and I said thank you, and the pipe said something like don’t tease me. I wiped my hands on my coat and went up.

Lucy was in the atrium with her both hands around a mug she hadn’t had before. She had made coffee. It smelled like it always does at midnight: like apology and promise in equal measure.

“Tell me,” she said.

“He has a name,” I said. “He has plans. He thinks he has a castle. He thinks he is a king of pockets.”

Her face whitened under its professional. “You saw him.”

“I did,” I said. “He is a particular kind of our kind. He is the sort who eats what other people tell themselves is not important. He calls himself Kettle.”

“Kettle,” she said. She put the name on her tongue the way you put a blade down, carefully, and still cut yourself. “What do we do.”

“You lock your doors,” I said.

“They are locked.”

“Then you lock them like a person, not like a building. You sit and you watch and you keep the lights on like you have company. He uses keys that are made out of permission. Don’t give him any.”

“You’re telling me not to sleep.”

“I’m telling you to sleep in here,” I said. “I’ll be back after I go below.”

She nodded without argument. She had the orderly mind that does what is required. She dragged in a chair and a blanket and set her coffee on the low table as if she were at her own hearth. The fish moved under the water, each an exhale of orange. We watched them. We counted. Seven. Still seven, though my shoulder throbbed in twos.

“Will he come back,” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “He doesn’t think of this as yours. He thinks of it as his way. He will come back until he is not hungry or until someone tells him a better story.”

“Are you the someone.”

“I can try to be,” I said. “Saint Paul is not big enough for a goblin with that mouth.”

“I’ll pay you more,” she said, and that was the wrong thing to say and she knew it as soon as the words were out and winced. “Sorry. I didn’t mean—”

“You did,” I said, because there was no teeth in the truth that night. “Keep the coffee hot. If he comes back, you don’t say a word. You watch his reflection. Reflections tell on us. Every time.”

When I left her, the temperature smacked my face with a glove. I pulled my coat close. The sky was a small god with no friends. I cut south toward the river. There are mouths down there that only our kind find. There are names we don’t give to anyone else because we like our quiet too much. The city’s old bones turned in their sleep. The roads had that shine that says you will fail your footing if you think you are above the laws of friction.

Under the bridge, there is a gate. You don’t see it unless you come from an angle that knows it. You think you are walking under stone and salt and then there is a hinge. I pressed it with the back of my hand. It let me pass like a relative that is a little embarrassed about how long it has been.

Inside is the place I keep things that I cannot keep in drawers. Maps. Stories. A chair I stole from a lobby when I was nineteen because a man told me I couldn’t. Bits of copper wire that remember the voices of phones. A coat that belonged to my mother. On the wall, four framed pieces of nothing. They are the negative spaces where friends used to stand. Goblins don’t photograph easily. You take a photo of a goblin and you get a very nice chair in the light from the window and the stubborn feel of someone who will not be told to smile. So we frame the empty, and if it’s empty still, sometimes you say hello to it anyway.

I made the stove tell me its story. It told me about a pipe that had been coaxed into being friendly and a night two years ago when a boy with cheeks red from crying had fallen asleep under its iron and I had covered him with the coat. I asked it a question it could answer: had there been, recently, a goblin with a wet breath and a tooth and a laugh that could soften a screw? Yes, said the stove. Yes. He came through here two months ago. He laughed and kissed the door. He tasted like pond water and the old money people hide in dictionaries.

We have a network, we goblins. It is not formal. It is the thing you do when someone tells you a name that makes your skin move. You say it without saying it. You mark a hinge. You offer a caution in the way you pass a cup. In the underways, we tie threads around pipes when a problem goes by. I checked the pipe. There was a slender twine knotted there, the knot with the loop that makes you think of a mouth. I followed the twine with my eyes. It went along the wall into the dark. I took it down. Following someone else’s thread is bad manners. But I had my own.

I spread my maps on the table and marked where Lucy’s building lived. Marked where the boy in Highland Park sobbed. Marked where the old woman over on Como had called me because her pond had a ghost and I’d told the ghost to go to the river and he had, grateful, dripping. Marked the brewery where a cook who saved her tips in a coffee can had woken to find the can lighter and five runty fish in her sink not hers and all dead. This last made my blood move in a direction I don’t like.

He had a route. Not just because he was hungry, but because he was mapping. He was testing locks and brightness and permission. And he was headed, all his points pointed, toward the hill. The hill with the Cathedral and the mansions that look like they would be better churches than the Cathedral if they could be. The place where armchairs get upholstered twice more than they need to be because someone cannot stand to let a thing go even when it’s done its work.

He wanted a lushness. He wanted a life lived out in rooms that grew like fruit. He wanted velvet in the walls. He wanted tapestry with no moths. He wanted servants who would not say the word no. He wanted—something I did not want to name. It was bigger than fish.

I had seen a place like that, once. When I was younger and my knees had more ideas, I had worked a job for a man with a tie like a noose he didn’t know he wore. He had a mansion on Summit he let be cruel to people. I got back mostly photographs of embarrassment and a wedding ring that had decided to stay in the bedside drawer of a woman who was not a wife. I had watched a party once in that house through the gap where the vine never grew. People who had rooms did things you only do when you have more rooms. They made a certain sound when they laughed and it wasn’t about joy. I had gone home to my couch and my stove and thought: no.

Maybe you think goblins are always petty. I am. I have kept a penny I found in a church vestibule for nineteen years because of how it lay there not wanting to be found. But I am not that kind of petty. I do not want to build anything that makes other people’s doors thin. I do not want to be a man whose mouth makes parents explain.

My grandmother taught me a song for when the city is about to go crooked. Not to stop it. To walk straight while it does.

I slept very little. If you call what I did sleep at all. Between the stove and the table and the map and the little cupboard with the very good bread in it, I made a bed that held me up and down and sideways. In the morning, I woke to the river having its morning argument with the ice. I washed my face in water that had opinions and put on a coat that had the right number of pockets.

I went to see a man named Torvald who had been on the underfoot longer than I have. He keeps a shop that sells nothing. People come in and put coins in a jar and stand around like they meant to buy a thing and leave with a secret. It is a good business because people hate to go home with the exact same heart they left with.

Torvald’s shop is on Wabasha, where the street has decided to be honest about being cold and then cozy and then cold again. He is a troll. Fine, say it. Get the laugh out. He is everything a troll is supposed to be except foolish. Green, if the light is mean to him. Tall if the ceiling allows. Hands like shovels. He can make a quarter disappear and he never steals anything you will notice is gone. He is gentle. He is also mean if he has to be. I have seen him throw a man out who tried to sell something that wasn’t his. He throws you out with the air. You feel the whole room decide you are somewhere else.

“Merrin,” he said when I walked in. He says my name like it has one syllable too many. “You have the look of somebody other people are going to get tired of soon.”

“The look is called a face,” I said. “We try to keep them.”

“What brings you to my humble nothing.”

“Goldfish.”

His forehead creased. “We don’t eat those,” he said. “We never have. It’s an old thing. You can frown at it if you like but you will not change it.”

“Not we,” I said, and breathed out. “Kettle.”

Torvald closed his eyes. “Ah,” he said like it hurt. “Of course. He came in here last week. He tried to pay for nothing with a handful of change that smelled like a fountain and a laugh like it had crumbs on it. I told him to go bother someone who had said aloud that the world was for them.”

“And then.”

“I sold him a story,” Torvald said. “He thought it was a rug. He wanted something to put under a couch he hasn’t bought yet.”

“The hill,” I said. “He’s going to the hill.”

“Of course he is,” said Torvald. “That’s where the houses are that think they are better than their owners. He likes mouths. He likes to feed the grins of bricks.”

“Did he tell you where he sleeps,” I asked, and Torvald laughed until the light shook.

“He told me nothing true,” he said. “But when he left he put his hand on the door frame and he left a hair and the hair told me he had been staying in the old Heather building, down near the river, where the windows make promises they cannot keep. Room 2B. For a night. Maybe two. He will have gone by now.”

“It’s enough,” I said.

“I will help in the way I can,” said Torvald slowly. “I will tell the pipes on Summit that if they are asked to breathe warm in new walls they should take their time. I will tell the ovens to be stubborn. I will tell the stairs to count wrong.”

“That will make more than one man late for work,” I said, but we both knew that’s how cities do kindness to themselves. They slow you when you think speed is what you need. They make you sit at a red light long enough to decide to turn left instead and then you meet a woman who tells you a story you divest your sadness into and it saves you from something. The city is smarter than we are.

I left with the door telling my coat that I needed a seam mended. I went to the Heather building and let myself in with my politest skeleton key. The hall smelled like the carpet had decided to die and then thought better of it out of spite. Room 2B had been cleaned recently. That sort of clean that makes a place more haunted, not less. No hair in the sink. No note under the lamp. No feeling in the wall of a back leaned there that shouldn’t have. But the window. The window had its frost still on it, and in the frost someone had drawn a circle and two slashes: jaws. He had been bored. He had wanted to watch the river and lick his teeth. He’d wanted someone to watch him watch the river.

There was a single gold scale on the floor, resilient as a coin.

It’s a funny thing. The tiny sins. The ones that glitter. You can explain them. You can say: no one was hurt. You can say: the building will not miss one little shimmer. You can say: they grow scales like the trees grow leaves; what difference does one make. The scale made a difference. It told me what his hand had been doing. It told me how awake his mouth was. He was practicing. He had plans. He had an upper hand and he wanted to use it as a spoon.

I put the scale in my pocket and went to find a different friend. Her name is Dawn and she cuts hair for the living and spills salt for the dead. She is a witch in the way barbers are, with scissors that snip lies and combs that pull secrets to the surface like burrs. Her shop sits under a neon sign that has decided the letter R is too much work most days and remains a N. Her floor is always clean. Her sink is always full of conversation. She saw me and flicked a drape with a wrist like the start of a symphony.

“You look like the inside of a pocket,” she said.

“You do hair. You do metaphors,” I said.

“I do you if you sit. Sit. Tell me why you have someone else’s scale in your pocket. Don’t look surprised. I can smell them. Goldfish smell like anxious cheap. Like love that wasn’t expensive enough for the person who bought the bowl.”

She cut my hair for an excuse and I told her about Kettle and the river and the way he said castle like he thought it was a shirt that would fit him for the rest of his life.

“He’ll have found a sponsor,” she said. “No one builds a lushness alone. There is always somebody who wants to nest in the cushions in the first part of a story. He’ll have a person with a checkbook and a love of trouble who thinks a goblin will be easier to control than a human.”

“Who on the hill runs their own house and would invite an appetite in,” I asked.

Dawn snipped with elegance. “A woman named Marigold Vane. She keeps orchids and gossip. She has rooms for people she collects. She thinks collecting is kindness. She will be easy prey for a mouth that can turn gratitude into leverage.”

I felt something anti-gravity in my stomach, like I was perched over a stairwell and the banister was weak. “How do I find her.”

“You walk west,” said Dawn. “You look up at the house with the green copper that was new in 1914 and is now older than the handrails in churches. You come on Thursday during the hours when people who have help think they are alone. Or you go there when it’s dark and watch the windows. They will tell you how many hands live inside.”

“I am not good with ladies named after plants,” I said. “They are always very sure of their leaves.”

“Because they are rooted,” Dawn said, and brushed the little hair off my collar. “Because they know they are more alive than the upholstery. Go. Be careful. The kind of man who eats goldfish is the kind of man who will eat anything that looks back at him with awe.”

It was afternoon by then and the city had decided to be bright. The sky had its head on straight. People were out in the way they do here when they believe the cold might have lost interest. I tucked my ears under my hat and walked. Summit rose up like it always does, with the self-importance of someone who remembers every penny thrown at it. The houses were a mixture of joy and unpleasantness. I like the tiny ones best, the ones that know they are houses and not declarations. But I went to the big ones because that’s where castles learn how to speak.

Marigold Vane’s house was green and old and delicious in the way money is when it’s been converted into wood and copper and the sound feet make on hall floors. The front gate was handsome. It wore its security in a single quiet hinge. I listened. Hinge said: this one opens for people who pretend they live here. The house reflected the sky in a way that was a choice. I rang the bell with my left hand and stood in a way that promised to leave if asked right.

A woman answered. She wore floating things and a smile like a box of hairpins. It could poke you if she wanted. Her eyes were roses in the way that roses have thorns and not in the way that roses are punished for being soft.

“Hello,” she said. “I don’t buy. Not from the door.”

“I’m a neighbor,” I said. “I rob the post. I’m taking a survey about who steals fish.”

“You’re a goblin,” she said without flinch. “I love goblins. You all have very sensible shoes.”

“We like not falling down,” I said. “Marigold Vane?”

“She is me,” she said, and tilted her head in a way that made the sunlight say yes. “And you are?”

“Merrin. I live below. In the city. I came to tell you that someone with a mouth like a drain is coming to sit on your couch.”

“How refreshing,” she said. “People think I have too much seating.”

“Kettle,” I said. “He will use you for a stepping stool. He will stand on you to put velvet in his walls.”

“Ah,” she said. She put a finger to her lip and thought in the slow way of a person who does not like to move fast in public. “He came to a party here. He told me he makes friends with the parts of buildings no one else loves. He said he was going to be a prince. I have a soft spot,” she admitted, “for princes.”

“Make it softer,” I said. “Not for him. For yourself. Move your furniture out of harm. Stop inviting appetites. Eat your own food first.”

She looked past me at the street as if someone was about to walk by who would validate her structure. “Thank you,” she said, but in the tone that says: I hear a song but I will not hum along unless it becomes fashionable. “Do you need anything. There’s coffee, and little sandwiches.”

“Do you have toast made from bread someone else thought wrong for toast,” I asked, because sometimes you can tilt someone with food.

“I have a cook,” she said, which was not an answer.

“Well,” I said. “Happy luck to you.” It was all I could think. I could not stand there and give a sermon. I am not a sermon. I am a man who puts his ear to pipes and then tells them secrets they can live with. As I turned to go, I saw in the reflection of the front window that someone had come up behind her in the hall and stood with the confidence of someone who knows the corners in a room that does not belong to him. A shadow with a jaw.

He was already here.

I kept walking because sometimes you do the most polite thing you can do for yourself, which is not to climb into a trap. I made a left. I made a right. I stepped on the cracks because the cracks were speaking and what they said was: hurry, but not in your feet. I put my hand into my coat pocket and took out the goldfish scale. It was warmer. That was not good. It meant the mouth that had owned it was thinking of me, too.

When I reached the bottom of the hill, the wind said my name in the tin sign of a laundromat. It said it the way people say your name when they’re reminding you that you belong here. I thought of Lucy in the atrium with her coffee that smelled like better times. I thought of Torvald telling ovens to be stubborn. I thought of Dawn with her scissor songs. I thought of a boy with a porch and a pond and a sadness that sat down and refused to leave.

I went back to the river. The river held the city up and laughed at it and blessed it and called it a fool. The river had never changed. It did not care about castles. It did not care about velvet in the walls. It cared about the way we moved along it and the way we broke it in winter and the way we apologized in spring without saying sorry. I put my hand on the ice and it said: be patient and also don’t be.

I have a particular set of politenesses. I used one now. I asked the bridge to watch the hill. I asked the lamplight to tell me if a window turned into a mirror too quickly. I asked the alleyways to hide me when I needed it and to trip him when he didn’t. I asked the city to remember that even appetites have necks.

Night came like a blanket someone had knit in a hurry. I ate a sandwich that tasted like a complicated apology. I sharpened a pencil. I wrote on my hand: Don’t stand in front of him. Don’t let him show you his teeth like a magic trick. Don’t talk yourself into being smaller.

When the hour got to the part where the bars make bad decisions, I went back to the atrium. Lucy was awake. She had made a second pot. The fish were six.

Her hand shook once, then held still. She didn’t speak. I didn’t either. Words would have made a spatter and there was enough of that.

We sat. We listened. We counted again because hope is a habit. Six. Six. Six. I felt in my pockets for a miracle and came up with lint and a map and a coin with a hole through the president’s face where management had drilled it to tether it to the register. I put the coin on the table with the hole pointing north. I am not superstitious but I am not foolish enough to ignore the songs that used to keep us from walking off cliffs.

Just before dawn, there was a sound in the maintenance corridor. It was a breath and a thank you. It was a hinge that had been charmed with a story. I stood. I put my finger to my lips. Lucy nodded. Her face had the transparency sorrow tries on in the morning, when it isn’t sure if it is going to stay all day or take a shower and leave. We watched the door. It did not open. The sound paused and then moved on. That’s when I understood something I should have earlier.

He didn’t always go for the same door. He had a dozen ways in and a dozen ways out and a dozen friends who thought they were his friends when they were his furniture. He wouldn’t come when I put my back against the place he came before. He would do something smug. He would do something his mouth liked.

I went to the big glass and looked at it the way you look at a mirror when you’re trying to see past your own face. In the reflection of the pond I saw a shadow on the far wall that wasn’t a plant. I tapped the pane. Lucy’s head whipped toward the maintenance door and I shook it no. I pointed to the opposite side of the room where the ventilation grate breathed a quiet life. The grate wore screws. The screws had been warmed by something that wasn’t air.

I moved without moving. I sidled like a rumor. I got to the grate and put my ear on the metal. It said: an animal, but not. It said: a mouth. It said: you are not alone on the right side of the wall.

I had one small thing left. I took out the coin with the hole. I swallowed it. I do this sometimes; don’t ask. It makes your throat hum to a note the vents understand. The grate hummed back. The screws gave up. The metal swung and a hand came out of the dark toward me, one finger licked in pond and the nail filed on stone.

I bit him. Right where he would feel it. On the pad that a man uses to count money. He yelped, pulled back, and I hooked the grate with my other hand and pulled it closed. The screws took a breath and stuck home again.

From inside, there was a voice, all sugar and contempt. “You cannot stop hunger,” he said. “You can slow it. But you cannot stop it. You cannot.”

“We can aim it,” I said, thinking of a river. “We can cook for it.”

A sound like laughter. A sound like a coin thrown into a puddle. A sound like the paper-thin kiss of a fish lifted from a bowl. And then the ventilation system turned lazy and resumed its usual prayer.

I looked at Lucy. She had put one hand on her own heart like you do when you need to remind it to keep working. She nodded to me, once. She counted the fish again and said six and then she swore, softly, under her breath, in a way that made me think she was capable of throwing a plate at a wall if necessary, and that made me like her more.

We were in it then. It had begun. The city had been put on a low simmer. The man with the goldfish mouth had decided where he would put his first chair in his first room in his first castle. He was going to have velvet in his walls if he had to rip it out of grandmothers’ parlors to get it. He was going to eat the things people thought they owned and tell them they were relieved.

I left at noon when the sun had the nerve to pretend it knew what it was doing. I walked a grid and made notes. I whistled to the pipes and told stories to hinges. I told the bridges that they were not allowed to let someone cross if he said the word castle in a certain voice. The city listened because it likes to be asked. It likes to be the hero, even when it’s just holding a door.

That night I sat on my couch because the bed wanted me to be honest and I didn’t have it. I wrote on my table. I wrote on my hand. I drew a little house with velvet in the walls and put an X through it, like that would keep it from being built. I fell asleep like a man trying not to.

I dreamed. In the dream I was under the hill in a room made of green light and soundproofing. There were couches that sighed when you sat and tables that offered their corners to your knees and a fireplace that whispered keep me. Across the room was Kettle, sitting with his shoes off and his feet curled in pleasure like a boy’s at a circus. He looked at me with affection, which was the worst thing, and he said: you’ll come around, Merrin. Everyone likes comfort. And I said: not like that. And he said: but you already do. And I looked down and saw that the velvet in the walls had my handwriting on it. It was all the polite words I had ever used, stitched into fabric and pressed into sound. It was beautiful. It was suffocating.

I woke up with my hands on my own throat like a draft had tried to get in. The room was dark. The kettle on my stove had exhaled itself into a doze. The list under my table scratched my name. Outside, the wind had waited in the corner by my window and now it got up and passed through. He was already building. Somewhere, maybe on the hill, maybe in a place we had forgotten about on purpose, walls were becoming thick. He would live long in them. He would live soft. He would call it triumph.

I rubbed my eyes and lit the stove. The first blue of flame shivered like a small mercy. I took the map and drew a line from my place to the hill and then to the river and then around again. A loop. The city is a loop. It holds and releases, holds and releases. I would have to decide where to break it, and how, and whether anyone I loved would forgive me when I did.Morning put its hand over the city’s mouth and told it to breathe quiet. I made coffee like an apology to the kettle god for dreaming it into a liar, and the kettle forgave me with a single, dignified puff. The couch let me up with springs that had opinions about my spine, and I told them I would take their complaints to management. Management is me. The list under my table scratched the word castle until the wood made a sound like a tooth on a glass.

I put my coat on and my hat that has a worry sewn into the band and went to see the university before the students had folded themselves into their chairs and their phones. The atrium wore the last of the dark like a scarf someone forgot to take off inside. Lucy had been there all night; she had the look of someone who had argued successfully with herself twice. She lifted a hand when she saw me, palm up, the way you show a person you are not hiding a knife.

“Six,” she said, and there was a way her mouth held the number that wanted a safer number more.

“Not no,” I said, because we take our victories where they live. I knelt and let the pond tell me its temperature with a finger. The water was honest. The fish were honest in the way that creatures are when they cannot conceive of pretense. The plants fanned slow as saints turning pages. I could hear the building’s ducts above us, clearing their throats after a night of secrets.

“I have an idea,” I told her.

“Tell me it does not involve draining the pond and telling my students the fish resigned,” she said, and the attempt at a joke landed like a fork on a tiled floor.

“Not that,” I said. “You told me you teach young people who think acids have feelings.”

“They do,” she said. “On certain days they take revenge.”

“What would you put into water that would make it taste like a mistake to a mouth that knows coins,” I asked. “Not poison. I won’t do poison. Something that says in a very firm tone that swallowing is going to feel like a regret for a week.”

She set her mug down so carefully I thought of surgeons. “There are bitterants. Denatonium. It makes adults admit the word no. We put it in cleaners to keep toddlers from drinking the under-sink. It is safe, mostly, in the quantities we would use. I could add a drop.”

“To the whole pond,” I said, making a face the way a man does when he imagines his childhood and finds it has worn the wrong coat. “The fish?”

“They will object,” she said. “But they will live. I can test with a smaller jar first. I am not careless, Merrin. I have a lot of practice with not killing what I love.”

“It will make his mouth remember you don’t like him,” I said. “Memory is better than law.”

She nodded, already making a list in the air with her eyes. “I can pull some water, make the solution, reintroduce. If he takes another, he will spit it. He will go somewhere else. The trouble,” she said, “is that he will go somewhere else. He will find a place with no chemist.”

“The trouble,” I said, and added it to the map in my head, “is where else he is going.”

She looked at me over the rim of her mug and let me see enough of what the night had required that I knew I would not tell her the worst part, which was the way he’d said castle like a prayer.

“I’m going to the hill,” I said.

“Bring a rope,” she said. “Or a ladder. Whichever is more honest.”

I left her measuring out the bitter, counting drops with a precision that would make a saint jealous. The day had warmed by a degree; the winter noticed and sneered. I cut up toward Summit the long way, using alleys that had collected a century of glances. A blue jay watched me from a wire and gave me some advice in a series of clicks. I thanked it and did not follow the advice. If I did everything blue jays told me, I would be king of a trash can behind a bakery by now and covered in glory and frosting.

Marigold Vane’s house took sunlight like a compliment. I did not go to the door. I don’t like repeating my knock when I know the house has learned the sound. I went around, making myself a shadow where the garden wall met the service entry. Service doors are different from guest doors; they tell the truth without looking for applause. I let the hinge introduce me to the lock and slipped in on the back of a smell like onions and clean floors. The kitchen had three kinds of light: a window’s, a bulb’s, and the light a room makes when it is kept so well that gratitude becomes reflective. A man in a white shirt adjusted something in a pot without admitting it was soup. He glanced over. Some people startle when they see me in their kitchens. He didn’t. He had a face that had seen worse than goblins and had chosen a pan as the correct answer.

“You lost,” he asked.

“Practicing,” I said, and he nodded like the priest nods when you’re not sure you’re confessing the right way but you’re doing it earnestly.

“There’s a meeting,” he said. “Upstairs. If you like meetings from which you weren’t invited.”

“I’m very good at pretending I live there,” I said, and palmed a spoon I had no intention of keeping because sometimes you need a meaningless theft to make a room look in the wrong direction while you walk out of it.

The stairs from a kitchen are different from the stairs by a front door. The treads know the weight of people who carry. Their banister doesn’t like being polished because it prefers being touched. I went up close to the wall where dust hides when it’s tired. The house above opened into rooms that had been arranged according to someone’s idea of good taste and then rearranged because taste is a tyrant and sometimes you must be wrong on purpose to feel alive. I could hear voices down the hall. I could smell the mild panic of lemon oil.

The meeting was in a small library with a couch that had forgotten the names of the books. Marigold sat at one end with the posture of a woman who understands that the world will be improved by leaning forward at the right moments. Her hair had made arms of itself and embraced a comb. Across from her, a man with a neck that had made promises to bow ties and kept all of them tapped ash into a glass tray with a style that believed in itself. Between them, and to the side in a seat that looked like it resented being sat upon but was going to be hospitable about it, sat Kettle.

He had a tie on. It was a tie like a joke. He wore it as if wearing it made him own all other men’s ties. He had rolled his hunger back into a smile. He held a teacup in a way that made it look like a mouse he was deciding whether to eat. His left hand, the one I had bit in a dream and in a vent, was bandaged in a neat white. The bandage made his hand look respectable in the way dressing a wound does when it wants to be a cuff.

“I want a room under the music room,” he was saying in his voice that had been sanded smooth to impress the carpet. “We will call it a pocket. The walls will have velvet. Not red. Red is a story other people wrote. Deep green. The color of a long secret. People will come and they will sit and they will be safe to say the thing that makes them interesting. You will have a salon that is talked about in the corners of men’s mouths.”

Marigold was nodding, half hypnotized and half triumphant. “And the city,” she said. “Is the city fine with this.”

Kettle smiled with his wrong half. “I have permits,” he said, as if the word itself was magic. “Conditional. Use. I have a contractor. I have a man at a desk who thinks my name is something it is not and stamps forms because he wants to go home at five. I am very good at letting men go home.”

The bow-tied man offered a paper with a flourish. He had the shine of a person who has made a commission and hides his teeth for fear someone will tax the smile. “The walls,” he said, “will breathe with the soundproofing. We will need fabric. Yards. Roll after roll.”

Marigold touched the paper like it might tell her a fortune. “It will be delicious,” she said. “We can have Thursday nights. We can have music that is not invited to the front parlor. We can have poets with cigarettes like secrets. We can have scientists with forbidden beakers and the tiny spoons they use for measuring sins.”

Kettle’s eyes flicked toward the door and I remembered I am not larger than a hinge. I pressed myself into the seam where the books met the wall. Books are patient. They were not going to tell on me. They liked a witness. He did not see me, or he pretended not to. He looked back at the paper and let his mouth be pleased.

“It takes seasoning,” he said, and he said it as if nothing in the world could be easier. “Rooms need names like soup needs salt. I will take care of it. Leave the seasoning to me.”

My hand went cold. Marigold sipped. The man with the ash clicked. Kettle tilted his head and let me hear his tongue on his teeth in the space between a sentence and its echo.

I could not make a scene in that room. Even if I had walked in and introduced myself as the man who would ruin Kettle’s day, I would have done a theater and accomplished a headline and Kettle would have collected the attention and turned it into rent. I made a list of what I had: a barber who could snip a spell into hair whether the head knew it or not. A troll who could make ovens too stubborn to bake velvet. A chemist who could make a pond into a polite instruction. A city that liked me better than it liked a tie.

I slid back the way I’d come, through the dust lane past the stairs, into the kitchen where the spoon I had stolen teased me from my pocket and I returned it to its drawer. The cook watched me with a face that knew when someone had seen more upstairs than they intended and decided to share a small mercy instead of a question. He handed me a heel of bread without narrative. I nodded and tucked it into my coat. Bread keeps people honest.

On my way out, I passed the pantry. Pantries are gossipers. I pressed my palm to the cool wood of the door and told it a story about keeping food for the right mouths. It hummed back a warning that room under the music room had already started to make a hum of its own, like bees told to be quiet. I told it I would be back with mops that understood pride.

I bled myself into the day, down the hill, into the rooms below where we meet for real. Torvald’s shop had a crowd of one when I opened the door. A woman with a scarf knitted out of a color that didn’t exist before she invented it had her hand in the jar the way you do when you don’t trust your brain to pick a secret without touching it. Torvald looked at me and lifted his mouth in a way that kept a customer at peace and put a friend on alert.

“He is buying velvet with permits,” I said in a voice the floor knew how to keep.

“Of course he is,” Torvald said. “He has always liked doing wrong with a receipt.”

“He will season his rooms with the names of things people don’t think matter,” I said. “He will invite them in. He will make them ornamental. He will take and take and call it hosting.”

Torvald’s hands went quieter, which means he was thinking of a worse thing than we had said. “Tell me your plan.”

“I will make it so the pieces he needs to finish will not want to be finished,” I said. “I will talk to fabric. I will talk to glue. I will talk to the little nails that hold the tack to the chair when the chair is tired of being leaned on by that one particular elbow. And I will make his seasoning hurt.”

“How,” he said, and I gave him the smallest part, because we do not put the whole of our worry on one counter.

“Lucy has a bitter,” I said. “A polite no you cannot swallow. Dawn can put a haircut on a man so every time he thinks the room approves of him, his hair will fall wrong across his eyes and he will forget his line. Jao has bells that do not work and I can make them work once, for a minute, in a vent at the right hour. And you can tell the ovens to make bread only when I say so that the smell goes to the room under the music room and sits there like a rebuke.”

Torvald snorted into a handkerchief. “You want my ovens to refuse to bake for a moneyed house.”

“I want your ovens to feed the part of the house that hates the new part,” I said. “There is always a section that resents the addition. Old wood that was left in peace for ninety years and then suddenly a man with a tape measure. It will help if it has toast.”

He thought about it and nodded like a man agreeing to a minor crime with good theology. “Done. I will be insulted on a schedule. When.”

“Thursday night,” I said. “He likes Thursdays. Marigold likes Thursdays. In the meantime,” I added, because the problem wasn’t only upstairs, “I need thread.”

He reached under the counter and put a skein on the wood the way you set down a bird that bit you and you had to respect it for trying. It was the twine we tie to pipes when we warn each other. He twisted a length around his finger and tore it with his teeth. “Take more than you think you will need,” he said. “You will always need twice as much thread and patience.”

Dawn’s shop was lit like a decision. She had a man in her chair with a beard he had grown to keep himself from talking. She was teaching it about hindsight. I sat in the waiting chair and kept my hands on my knees because her floor likes that. When she finished and sent him out with a reminder to drink water and call his mother, she turned her whole face toward me. People underestimate the power of a whole face.

“He wore a tie,” I said without hello.

“Let him have his ribbon,” she said. “I’ll cut it if it tightens.”

“I need hair,” I said, and she didn’t smile because some requests don’t benefit from the joke that presents them to the world as harmless.

“For a knot,” she said simply.

“For a knot,” I repeated. “Not his. Mine. Someone’s. Hair from the city. And salt that’s not from a shaker. The kind that knows which docks it came past.”

She went to her drawer where she keeps the things you earn. She took a little twist of hair with three colors in it, all natural, all stubborn. She took a bag with salt in it that had seen a ship’s deck and maybe an argument. She added a small comb with two teeth missing and the memory of a woman who did not forgive easily. She put them in my hand and patted my fingers like a teacher.

“You’re going into a wall,” she said.

“I am going into a wall,” I said. “Will you come if I call.”

She squinted at my shoulder and said, “I’ll be at the east end of the block you don’t want me at, with scissors you’ve never liked. Tell the wall my name when it thinks it has opinions.”

The city closed around me as I walked like a book that has decided to be the right one. I checked the cracks and the way the snowmelt ferried cigarette butts to storm drains like little boats that had never believed in open ocean. I counted the windows with their curtains flat and the ones that breathed. I saw a boy take his glove off and put his hand on the bronze toe of a statue and make a wish that made his ear turn red when he heard it. I thought of the boy in Highland Park and tried not to wish I had met him first.

When I came back to Lucy, the pond was a polite argument. The fish swam in a way that said they had read the addendum and found it acceptable. She had a small beaker with a few drops of bitter in it and a stir stick with the patience of a nun. She saw my face which must have been a puzzle no one wanted to put together after lunch.

“How was the hill,” she asked.

“Hungry,” I said. “Your bitter is better. He is making a room under a room and giving it a name that people will think is a joke until they realize they gave it their jacket to hold and it never gives it back.”

She tipped the beaker and watched the pond play at disliking. “He will take from me again,” she said. “You know that.”

“He will try,” I said. “I am going to be in his way.”

She handed me a key. “To the maintenance,” she said. “And to the men’s.” She blushed and it was not at the word; it was at the idea that she had given me permission. “You will need them.”

“I have keys,” I said, and didn’t take them. “Keep your permission. It makes him bigger.”

She drew back and put the keys ring-down on the table. The ring made a sound that told me it did not like being put down. I took the sound and put it in my pocket as if you could. Sometimes you can. Sometimes you get to carry only the echo and that’s enough to wake a lock when it is sleeping on its job.

The day broke its knuckles and bled into evening. I ate the heel of bread from Marigold’s kitchen with cheese I had traded from a woman who sells only Wednesdays. I wound Torvald’s thread around my fingers until they colored. I tied Dawn’s hair around the bell Jao had left in a brown paper bag on my mat with a note that said this one has a wheeze, sorry. I took the comb and tucked it behind my own ear because sometimes you have to remind your head who it belongs to.

At full dark I went back to the hill. The house’s windows were lit like polite mouths. I slid into the side yard and put my hand on the foundation stones. Old houses like you to touch them; they’re vain. This one had vanity layered like cake. Under it, in the newly-cut space, the air changed its mind three times a minute. There was sound: not music, yet. Not voices. The sound of fabric sliding across itself and tasting the wall for the first time. The sound of men carrying sofas in their shoulders. The sound of a hammer that had learned to be careful.

I went to the vent that would be a vent into the new room. I fed the thread through with the care of a man telling a story to a child who is on the edge of sleep and danger. I tied the bell to the thread and flopped it gently until it lay on the far side with the hair looped neat around it: a pretty little no that would not ring until I asked in the right pitch. I braided salt into the thread and the thread into the vent and the vent into the brick by the kind of knot you only learn when your grandmother trusts you with the good yarn.

And then I went into the walls.

I have the shape for it. People act as if that makes going into walls easy and they are mistaken. Walls have resentments like families. They remember who put their hands inside them. They hate being opened and they hate being closed. This wall was new where it was old. Plaster from 1914 spoke with such dignity about horsehair that the new studs, bright pine with their high voices, were embarrassed. I slid along sideways and breathed shallow and kept my elbow from giving itself a name it wouldn’t answer to later. The velvet was there, not yet hung, leaning with the laziness of a cat in a window. It drank the dark. I reached a hand and touched it with the back of my knuckles. It was soft. It was sorrow. It was the kind of wrong that did not announce itself as wrong until your grandmother was dead and you tried to clean it and it swallowed the soap.

Voices came into the narrow like water under a door. A man’s that thought about invoices in his sleep. A woman’s that thought about candles that didn’t drip. Kettle’s, and the wall itself leaned in because it wanted to hear what kind of instructions a mouth like that gives.

“Here,” he said, very gently. Anyone who did not know him would have given him a strawberry for that tone. “This corner will be the corner where a person admits they’re afraid of aging. This corner will be for men who have not told their brothers they love them. Here,” and I could hear him place a palm on wood, “here we will put the chair where the woman sits who tells the truth and everyone calls her cruel and still they sit closer.”

He was making a map. Not of the city. Of nerves.

The contractor shuffled and grunted. “We got the fabric,” he said. “We got ten rolls. They cost me a favor I will regret.”

“You will not regret,” Kettle murmured. “You are part of something. There will be a list of names by the door. You will be on it.”

“I don’t need my name by doors,” the man said, and liked himself for the sentence. I liked him for it, too, a little.

“We all need the place where names hang,” Kettle said. “Don’t pretend, please. It makes me tired.”

I thought of the goldfish scale in my pocket and wished I had thrown it into the river that morning so it could go home to something bigger than both of us.

He moved closer. I could smell my own mistake from the vent in the atrium, the bite I had put on his hand with my mouth. He had put something on it. Oil? Violet? He wore his wound like a charm. He stopped in the space right below me and tilted his head the way men look at stained glass when it’s dark outside and they are trying to borrow the memory.

“You feel me,” he said, and I understood he was not speaking to the contractor, the woman who did candles, or the velvet. He was speaking to me or to the house, and I was not sure which I wanted more. “You are as bad as I am,” he continued conversationally. “You like the way the walls breathe. You talk to kitchen knives. You think beds are honest and you sleep on couches because you prefer to be lied to by the furniture you trust.”

I swallowed and the little comb behind my ear poked me in a way that said stop internalizing a man’s essay about you just because he learned to say it like a glass of water.

“No,” I said quietly for me, for the wall, for the velvet that would have eaten the word if it could. “I like rooms that know what they are and do not make rooms inside themselves to trap people into performing intimacy.”

He laughed. He tipped back his head and laughed and his laugh hit the beams and came back dressed up as a good time. The contractor grinned because he could not help it. The woman smiled because it is always easier when the man with the plans is pleased.

“You will like it,” he said. “You’ll come around. Even your friends will come. Even your troll will come and talk about bread. Even your barber will come and pretend not to. Even your chemist will come because she will want to know what happens when a thousand nights of people telling the truth evaporate into a ceiling and everyone who breathes under it catches a kind of cold they tell themselves is wisdom.”

I reached up and touched the beam above me and whispered a dirty joke my grandmother told when she drank and lied that she didn’t, because sometimes the only way to make a room decent is to ask your ancestors to fart in it. The beam creaked like a laugh. The woman frowned, surprising and quick, as if she had felt a small instability in her shoe that had made her consider sitting down.

Kettle stilled.

“You’ll ruin something,” he said softly. “You’ll make it cheap.”

“I will make it safe,” I said as soft. “For the people you will pretend to host.”

He moved and I heard his hand on the velvet. “Protection is not your job,” he said, and in that moment everything he wanted to be came through like breath on cold glass. “You’re a finder. You find lost keys and bones. You pick up pennies in vestibules. Leave rooms to people with money.”

“People with money,” I said, and my voice made the nails in the studs warm from shame, “leave rooms to the mice and the plaster and the cold. People like us keep them alive.”

He didn’t answer to that, because he couldn’t, and because at that moment a bell rang once the way a bell rings on the other side of a dream when you are already standing up. He straightened. The contractor took a step. The woman turned her head and called, “Front door,” and her voice was relief dressed as efficiency. I breathed out and put my mouth close to the hair knot and told it later.

He would try the atrium again before our Thursday appointment. He would test a new approach. He would not be deterred by bitter or bells or scissor knots. He would be deterred by a thing he had not yet put on his list.

I backed out of the wall like a letter going back into a mouth mid-sentence. I got to the vent, to the thread, to air that had decided to be enough. I slid along the yard and into the alley and my breath made a thief of itself and ran without me while I caught up. I made the river a promise I had no right to make and the river accepted it, which made it worse, because when water accepts a promise it means it expects to be paid.

At the atrium, the night guard had a book with big print and a thermos. He nodded at me like we were both engaged in an honest crime. Lucy had left me a note under the corner of the map on her desk. In small letters that made me want to give her a room with locks that loved her, she had written: students have named them. The fish. This one is Anchor. This one is Itay. This one is Number Seven because testimonial reality. She had added, You tell me if the names help. I have more. I can give them a seminar.

Names are salt, he had said. Names are seasoning. I tapped the glass very gently with my knuckle. The fish swam toward the sound the way children come toward the sound of their own names said by someone with a piece of bread. I whispered through the seam: Anchor. Itay. Number Seven. If there is a heaven for fish I hope it looks like ice in sunlight; if there is one for goblins it looks like a table with four chairs that fit and no one has to ask who is coming.

The maintenance corridor had a shyness to it now. The bitter had gone into the water and had laced itself into the air. The vents breathed like they were rehearsing a difficult speech. I lay down on the tile, which is a position of respect in some families and a demonstration of bad judgment in others, and put my ear to the floor. I heard a rat. I heard the soft slide of a mop in its bucket. I heard the second stair counting wrong because Torvald had asked it to. I heard a man’s shoe pause and go back because the person wearing it remembered he had left his phone in the car and could not be parted from it even for fish.

And then I heard the shadow on the other side of the wall. It had the sound of a mouth that had learned a lesson and had decided to argue with it. I slid along, pressed the grate, and felt it breathe. He did not try my grate again. He was not a fool. He tried the little window that sits at floor level and looks like a smile on the wrong face of the room. I had seen it and ignored it because it is what you ignore when you see it. He did not ignore. The latch clicked. I had my word ready, the one my grandmother used when a fire needed to remember its borders. I put it into the latch with my breath. It was not magic. It was etiquette. The latch took it and refused him.

On the other side, a mouth that could turn nice words into baptized cuts clicked his tongue and said, “Merrin,” only the way you say it when you are first beginning to understand you are not alone on your own chess board. He left. Not in a hurry. In a way that made sure I knew he was not afraid.

I lay there longer than necessary because sometimes to stop yourself from running you must pretend you are very involved with tile. The tile had a crack that looked like a little river with a very tired fish in it. I put my finger along it and apologized to it for being my metaphor.

Out on Selby, the neon made promises and people believed them because believing is warmer. I went home. The couch pitched its case at my back like a lawyer who intends to win. I told it you get better at making peace with honest furniture as you age and it would have to respect my process. I washed the taste of new velvet out of my mouth with cold water from a pipe that bragged about its age. I wrote on the underside of the table: Thursday, bell, hair, salt, ovens, bitter, Dawn. Then I wrote: don’t let him decide who you are.

Jao had left another bell that wheezed a little less. I took it apart with the love you give your third try at a thing. Inside, the tongue had been filed wrong by someone with enthusiasm and no training. I filed it right and set it aside and told it, If you ring at the right time I’ll introduce you to a door that has never met its equal.

I slept hard and fast and poorly and woke with the city at my window, pressing its forehead against the glass like a cat. The day between now and Thursday would be a practice in not setting myself on fire with my own plan. I went to Torvald and he told me the ovens had burned two batches and he was in love with me in a way that would pass by evening. I went to Dawn and she showed me a pair of scissors that had learned a new story about mischief. I went to Lucy and she said, “I saw him,” and then, “He spat,” and then, “He looked at the water as if I had embarrassed him,” and we both experienced a joy I hate to admit.

“You will be in your office on Thursday until I tell you not to,” I said.

“I will bring a blanket,” she said. “I will bring my graduate students’ worst habits and correct them in my head to keep myself from breaking my own windows.”

“In the night,” I told the pond, because it had done me the favor of living, “there is a man who thinks he will make you into the beginning of a menu.” The fish moved in their small, private eternity. I wanted to be sure they would never learn what a menu is. I wanted to be sure of many impossible things. I settled for a plan.

I went to the Cathedral because sometimes you need to stand in a room where people have said a word until saying the word made the bones simpler. I stood with my hat in my hands because that is a politeness I still remember. The space made the small inside me comfortable and the loud inside me shy. A woman near the front lit a candle and I watched it catch the wick the way Kettle caught fish: quick, hungry, a little proud. I put a coin in the box to pay the candle’s rent even though it was not mine. The coin had a hole in it, and I thought about swallowing another and did not because the world is not a vent unless you insist.

In the side chapel there is a saint with a stump for a hand and a face that agreed to this before he knew what agreeing meant. I said my name to him the way you tell a dog you mean no harm. He didn’t answer because he’s responsible. On my way out, I touched the door. Even church doors like to be thanked. It said: there are boys who come here and eat the quiet and go home and tell their mothers they’re full. It said: be gentle if you can and sharp when you have to. It said: do not let the velvet win.

Back to the river, the bridge, the underplace where maps become confession. I sat on a crate and made three knots with Dawn’s hair and Torvald’s thread. One was for keeping a door from making a decision without me. One was for tying a bell to a breath. One was for binding my own hands if I got excited and tried to be the kind of hero that dies for drama. I put the last one on my wrist like a bracelet and told it earnestly that I like to live.

On Thursday afternoon, the light decided to try its best. The hill puffed itself up like a bird. The people who would come to Marigold Vane’s new room ironed their excuses and their good stories. Lucy sent me a message with inconveniently perfect penmanship that said: It tastes like medicine even to me. I told the ovens to wait for my whistle. I pressed my ear to pipes and begged them to sigh at the wrong moments. I put the bell in the vent’s mouth and told it if it rang early I would put it in a drawer with pennies and it would be forgotten until morning.

At dusk, I went to the house.

In the alley, the trash cans had mouths. They kept them shut because the alley was invited to a party and no one had told it how to dress. I slipped along the foundation and felt the room under the music room breathe. It had breath now. It had a temperature. It had a word it repeated to itself the way boys repeat their crushes’ names. The word was my. Not even castle. Just my.

Inside, I could hear the start of it. Marigold laughing in a tone that you use when you are paying your own cover. A violin tuning the way life hurts and is fine. Kettle moving because rooms make room for him if you do not tell them not to. The stairs to the service entry dropped me into a hallway with a rug that had come from a place where rugs were taught to tell you how much they had cost. I went to the mouth of the new room and saw it for the first time with my eyes.

It was beautiful. I hate beautiful things that have forgotten why they are. The velvet absorbed the sound and breathed it back in kisses. The lamps made islands of warm where people could sit with their knees nearly touching and pretend the nearness had been accidental. The chairs had been chosen to look like accidents that had always liked each other. On a table sat small plates with pastries that had a price per bite if you knew how to divide your sins. People were already there, leaning, their coats dozing in the front hall.

Kettle in a suit is like a knife in a velvet sack. He stood with his head tilted back like a man who has taught himself to hear money. He saw me. Of course he did. He had expected me. His smile was the kind you give a neighbor when you want them to think they smell something only you can name.

“Welcome,” he said, and his voice did not carry because the velvet took it and ate it and made it into a hum. “Welcome to the pocket. Would you like to tell a truth. Would you like to hear one.”

I took a step into the room because if I stood in the doorway too long I would become a different kind of person. The velvet tried to name me. The chairs tried to see if I was the kind who would take off his hat. I kept it on because my ears get cold when lied to. I looked at Marigold. She glowed, which is one of the worst things money can make you do. She saw me and nodded like a hostess to a fireman who has come to inspect the exits.

“I’m just here for the ovens,” I said. “When the smell comes, you’ll understand.”

“What smell,” said a woman on a couch, amused in the way that makes you want to push a lamp over. “Is this a bakery.”

“This is a room,” Kettle said, and there was a warning in his mouth for people who thought a joke was their job. “And it is about to have bread.”

I whistled. Not loud. Not showy. A little sliver of sound that would make a pipe sit up straight and button its front. Down the hill, ovens considered their day and decided they were not done. Heat rose in places it should not and a loaf, three loaves, ten, slid into perfection, refused to hold their breath, and sent their idea up through the streets the way people send prayers: inconsistently, earnestly, with a lot of unintended detours.

The smell came into the room under the music room in a pool that made knees weaken and heads tilt. You cannot pretend to have an original thought when bread is in the room. It is too old. Six conversations stumbled in the same spot and picked up different threads that felt more honest. The violinist laughed mid-tune. Marigold’s eyes filled briefly in that involuntary way when the body makes you tell the truth you were not planning to tell. Kettle closed his mouth.

“Bread,” someone whispered, and I could have kissed Torvald’s big troll hands.

Kettle changed tactics the way men change lanes when the lane they want forbids them. He put his palms together like a monk who has just learned there are fifty new kinds of chocolate and said, smoothly, “This is part of it. This is what rooms like this do. They feed.”

“Then let them feed on bread,” I said. “Not on name-salt and cheap sorrow.”

He smiled, but his eyes were fresh stone. I saw the bandage on his left hand flex and relax and I wanted him to put the hand in his pocket because I was tired of knowing where it was.

The bell in the vent, obedient as a dog ready to disrupt a wedding, rang one soft, perfect ring at the precise breath when the room thought it belonged to Kettle. Everyone’s head turned toward the vent. Everyone thought: a bell. In a wall. That means something. Even the people who do not believe in meaning felt their hips realign to look at it.

Kettle said, gently, to the room and the wall and me, “Don’t be vulgar.”

“You were going to season,” I said.

He moved closer. Around us, people told truths with the suddenness of an accidental sneeze and then covered their mouths in embarrassment and relief. Marigold had put her hand on the velvet without realizing it. I saw her tug her fingers away and look down at them as if they had been kissed.

“I won’t take from the professor again tonight,” he said. “I am not a fool.”

“You took from her this morning,” I said.

“I spat,” he said, and virtued it as if he had invented courtesy.

“That was her courtesy,” I said, and delighted in the twitch at his mouth.

“You think you can starve me,” he said, and close his voice came soft as a confession into velvet.

“No,” I said. “I think I can ruin your appetite.”

He laughed without sound. He stepped past me and put his hand up to the velvet the way a man touches a horse he intends to own. The velvet seemed to lean into it. The room hummed. Marigold laughed at something kind said in a wrong way. The violinist found a note he had not planned and held it until it became a memory. People ate little pastries and looked at one another like rooms had never been honest before this one arrived.

In the atrium, in my head, the fish turned and turned in water that did not want to be a metaphor. On the hill, men wore coats over suits and told themselves there is a difference between desire and hunger. In my pocket, the comb warmed as if a head had leaned against it. I realized I was smiling and it made me suspicious of my own mouth.

We stayed in the pocket and did what we were built to do, which is not to be alone. Kettle hosted, which is what a thief calls it when he steals without concealment. I tied a knot under the table where a thread had been resting, not to trap his feet, not to bring him down, just to make the room catch itself mid-habit and consider a different one. The bell rang again in the vent like a cough. Someone said, “Tell us a story,” to me, and I said, “No,” because sometimes the only way not to be consumed is to be difficult.

Late, when the bread smell had turned into something people remembered to love, when the velvet had taken its first hundred secrets and was smug with them, when the violinist had earned a drink he did not have to pay for, when Marigold was tired in the way that rich women never let themselves be in public until they accidentally are, Kettle came to the door and leaned against the jamb.

“You are very tiring,” he said.

“Likewise,” I said.

He looked past me as if I were a window, not a wall. “Tomorrow,” he said conversationally, “children will cry at Como and men will laugh on the hill. Life evens out.”

“Tomorrow,” I said, “there will be locks that forget you in my city.”

He pushed away and made a little bow he had stolen from a film and improved by ruining. “There is a boy,” he said as if he were forgetting and not highlighting, “with a porch. He is waiting.”

I had not told him about the boy.

“I will find you,” I said, and what I meant was, I will make the city so inhospitable to your particular politeness that you will think twice before you use the word my again in a sentence without tasting blood.

He walked away because he had a room that would miss him if he did not. I stood and moved to the vent and put my face near it and whispered Dawn’s name into it and the vent carried it the way gossip carries anything that might lead to scissors.

On Selby, the wind had uncrossed its arms. Jao had left a light on in the shop and a note on the counter that said: mouse. I left him a coin with a hole in it to put on a string across the register because little rituals keep the big rooms from swallowing us whole. Under my window, the city folded itself into its corners and waited for me to tell it which corner to unfold next. I sat on the couch because I am not done arguing with bed. I wrote on the underside of the table one more thing: go see the boy. Then I blew out the lamp and the dark pressed its ear to my mouth to listen to me breathe.Morning sat on the curb and let the cold braid its hair. I put on my coat with the pockets I trust and told the kettle that today it was not invited to boil. It hissed a little in the way friends do when you tell them a truth that offends their hobby. The list under my table had scratched itself into a mood. Go see the boy. I took a pencil and put a dot next to it the way you put a fingertip on a pulse to promise you will return to it. The city had tucked its edges in against itself. Snow made a lace that looked tender from one angle and a conspiracy from another. I laced my boots tight because men who tell you about their castles sometimes make you run.

Highland Park in winter is a tidy pocket with nickels in it and a hole you only find when your coin is gone. The houses wear porches proudly like teeth that never needed braces. Kids’ bikes stand in the cold as if waiting for court-ordered visitation with spring. I walked past a snowman with a hat too decent for his job and a stick arm that pointed toward the river like he was telling it to knock it off. I knew the house not by its number but by the way the air around it had practiced holding a breath too long. Grief does that. It tries to be polite and ends up being a draft you can’t find the source of.

On the porch there was a boy and a blue plastic bucket and the kind of determination you only see in saints, soldiers, and children who have been told they cannot fix a thing they love. His cheeks were chapped red in two clean flags. His mouth had learned a new line in the past week and it didn’t know whether to keep it. He looked up at me without surprise, because goblins in Saint Paul are not surprises if you are busy. He had a hat with a pom that had the gravity of despair. The bucket had a fish painted on it and a crack along its happiness.

“I came about your pond,” I said, and the courtesy of it felt like an insult to him and he handled that in a second and put politeness on like a jacket with a rip he didn’t have time to mend.

“My mom said you might,” he said. “She said you were a man who could hear doors think they were handsome.”

“She is not wrong,” I said. “Can I see it.”

He nodded and rose in a way that insisted he had not been waiting for me and had, at the same time, set out a cup in case I arrived. The yard was square with a fence made of a patient man’s weekends. The pond wore a lid of ice with a patch cut by someone who respects air. There were stones around it that had been chosen one at a time and loved the way the boy loved the fish he had put there in the hot month when everything makes sense. On the porch railing hung a net he had not used because he is a better person than I am.

“They had names,” he told me as if preparing me for a diagnosis. “Not fancy. Truck. Orange. The one with the tail was Yellow because I’m not stupid and because she was. There were ten. I counted. Then there were nine. Then there were seven. Then there were zero without meaning to be.”

“You waited,” I said softly. “You thought they would come back up if you gave them a reason.”

He coughed a laugh that had been practicing not crying. “My dad said leave it. My mom said to take the names off so I wouldn’t get hurt more. I didn’t. I kept them. If they came back up I wanted them to remember. It’s dumb.”

“It’s not,” I said. “Names are a way of holding. Sometimes when you stop holding a thing it falls the wrong way.” I crouched. My knees discussed it among themselves and filed a formal complaint I told them I would locate later in a drawer with receipts. The ice rim was neat on one side and wounded on the other, where fingers had pressed. The stones were scrubbed, like a boy had decided cleanliness was a prayer and tried to bring back fish by washing their porch. There was a drain cut into the far corner where the yard tilts the way yards do, to give the water a place to be a secret. The grate over it had been told it was a toy once and it had believed too hard and broke a little. I put my gloved hand on it. Warm, for winter. Not by much. Enough to tell me that the city had done a kindness and run a small line under here so pipes wouldn’t live in regret. Enough to make a tunnel taste like a way in.

“Anything else missing,” I asked, and it felt like burglary to use that tone in a boy’s yard.

“My pocket knife,” he said after a second that got lost. “But that was before. I lost it maybe. Or somebody took it because I left it on the rail. I’m not mad at them because maybe they needed a knife more.”

“Your name?” I asked, because you cannot protect a person unless you know what their bones say when they roll over.

“Eli,” he said. He wrapped his hands under his arms and stood the way we stand when we are pretending we are not cold because another problem is more important.

“I’m Merrin,” I said. “I am rude when necessary and polite because it keeps my teeth. May I touch the stones.”

He gave me a permission like a blessing and I took it carefully because I had told Lucy not to hand them out. The stones whispered in a voice like the one old jars make when you open them in a basement with no light. They said fingers. They said fingers that loved. And then they said a mouth that was not a mouth a boy should know. A mouth that meant to be kind to itself. A mouth that took one and was very proud about not taking two.

“He isn’t a cat,” I told Eli because he knew this and he needed me to say it. “He won’t leave pawprints. He’s good at coming ’round things that believe they belong to people who aren’t paying attention right now.”

“I paid attention,” Eli said with the kind of heat that would bend iron if it stayed long enough. “I did. I did every night. I came home and sat and I counted and I made sure they were eating and I told them I would be there and when it got cold I made sure the bubbles were bubbles and not ice pretending.”

“I know,” I said, and there is a way goblins know and he saw it. The part of him that had been humiliated by grown-ups making gentle sounds and telling him not to be so attached relaxed out of its dignity and let me be a little useful. “He is a man. A sort of mine. My kind. I am ashamed to say it out loud but it’s important. He believes that if you care about a thing he has the right to discover it first. He wants to build a place where caring is how he collects rent.”

Eli looked at the crack in the bucket as if the bucket had been consulted and given the wrong advice. “So he’ll come back,” he said. It wasn’t a question. It was a new line his mouth had to learn and it was going to say it until it owned it.

“He told me he would,” I said, because I won’t lie to boys on porches. “He told me you were waiting. Which means he thinks he knows your name now. We can change the taste of it.”

“How,” Eli asked. “If I named them, did that make him like them more. Is that our fault.”

“No,” I said quick and sharp, and the pond listened. “Names are not invitations. They are handholds. What we can do is teach him that your names are the wrong seasoning. He likes salt. We will give him nutmeg when he expects pepper. He will spit and leave and be mad and still leave.”

Eli thought a minute and you could see him choosing between old man rage and seven-year-old violence and the kind of simple tools children have when they are correct. He walked inside without asking me to follow and came back with a marker and a scarf and a sandwich his mother had put on the counter in the shape of a yes. He sat down with officialdom. He took the marker and wrote on a paper folded into tags. He held them up for me to read as if he were presenting homework to a god who grades weird.

“Car Payment,” he said. “Grout. Dentist Appointment. Shoe That Always Hurts That You Keep Anyway. We can change them when we want. We can call them something else if it makes them feel ugly. I think he would not like to eat Grout.”

I laughed and it reset my jaw. “You are vicious,” I told him. “Keep that. It will save you from men who try to sell you comfort when what you need is a blanket.”

We tied the tags on the stones because fish are not the only things that can be named. We named the drain Late Fees and we named the little blue bucket Not Your Business and we named the copper line that warmed the edge of the pond February, which even in Saint Paul has to admit it’s wrong sometimes. I took Torvald’s thread, not all of it, never all, and looped it under the grate and drew it up through the stones and tied it around the bell Jao had left that wheezed a little less. I tucked Dawn’s hair into the knot in a way that would make the knot remember whose scissors it feared. I set the bell just so in a small wooden birdhouse that had been waiting on a shelf for a spring that had not yet earned it. We put the house near the drain because bells like to be near mouths; it keeps them honest.

“When it rings,” I told Eli, “you will not move forward. You will not go near. You will not be a hero. You will put your hand on your chest and you will count to seven and you will blow out the air like you are blowing out candles you are too old to be excited about. You will whistle this,” and I gave him the sliver I give to pipes, the one Torvald’s ovens answer because it sounds like things getting done, “and I will come. How long will it take me.”

He looked at my legs and looked at the street and made a calculation that made me want to buy him a map. “Four minutes,” he said. “If you run like the men on TV in old shows. Or less if you cut across the O’Sheas’ yard because their dog is old and nice.”

“Two,” I said. “I have tricks you haven’t met yet. But I appreciate you seeing me for what I am and not what they put on billboards.” I took the coin with the hole through the president’s face and gave it to him. “String this across your pocket,” I said. “Not because it will keep your money safe. Because it will remind your pocket it has a job and sometimes your pocket forgets.”

He took it like a knight takes a favor and did not make a face at the word President because he has not yet had to think about whether Presidents deserve to have holes drilled through them. His mother opened the back door with a face that says: I am weary of being brave in my own kitchen. She saw me and the bell and the boy and the names. She had in her hand a sponge and a fork and a spoon because she had not known which was the right tool to bring outside today and had decided to try them all. We told her what we had done and I watched the place in her shoulders where fear makes its second home unclench a little enough to let her lungs express themselves.

“Thank you,” she said and did not say I don’t believe in goblins and did not say are you good and did not say can you make my son different. She said thank you and fed me a bite of the sandwich because when we save each other in this town we send you home with carbohydrates.

I stayed on the porch the way a man does who is bargaining with his own plan and losing on purpose because he knows that is the correct loss. Eli showed me the spot where he had sat for three hours the night the last fish didn’t come up and taught me a whistle he had made that calls rabbits and told me the rabbit never came. We pushed a little snow off the rail and he told me the names in case vowels matter more than ink. I told him that in my grandmother’s tongue, the word for Grout is the same as the word for a silence that does not mean consent. He liked that. He repeated it. It sounded like the inside of a pipe that swears.

I left him with the bell and a scarf and a plan that kept him from having to be brave at the wrong part of the day. On the street a mail carrier put her hand on a mailbox the way you do when your mother’s chair is empty. I passed a man scraping his windshield like a penitent and he nodded because goblins with purpose have right of way. The wind blew an opinion up the hill and I let it arrange my hair on the left side and not the right because Dawn has taught me that hair cooperates with certain missions and sabotages others.

Como Park has a quiet that is different from church. Church quiet hopes you are listening. Park quiet hopes you are breathing. The conservatory roof made sugar out of light. Outside, the pond wore a thin ice like a tired man’s laughter that was still trying to do the job. In summer, koi lie under lily leaves like monks in their saffron and children say the word fish the way a prayer would like to be said. In winter, the signs are askew and the men who tend the water wear hats with brims that the wind respects.

I stood at the edge and let the water tell me if anything left it last night that should not. Como has a memory like clean glass. It reflects exactly what you show it and nothing else. I smelled a mouth on the other side of an hour and the mouth had said the word mine like it was a blank check. He had come. Not last night. Recently enough that the metal had imported a trace of him and kept it to show me because parks are petty and let you know when a guest did not leave a tip.

“Help you,” said a voice that measured out caution and decided not to short me. I turned. The keeper had a beard too practical to be a metaphor and hands that could find coins dropped last summer with just a swish of their weight in a net.

“I’m Merrin,” I said. “I’m here about your missing monks.”

“We didn’t go public,” he said, impressed at being annoyed.

“That’s because the public will be awful about monks,” I said. “You have a man who thinks ornamental is his to demonstrate. Has he been polite to your locks.”

He scowled in a way that would curl paint if he let it. “He was a perfect gentleman to my locks. That’s what bothers me.” He put a foot up on the low wall and leaned as men do when there is something worse to tell and they want the posture to carry part of the weight. “He knows our vents. He knows the service hours. He knows my guy with the midnight coffee and the way he listens to the radio and thinks he’ll hear it tell him to look behind him. He’s not a raccoon.”

“He is a kind of that,” I said. “But with ties. Do you have names.”

He glanced at me and the glance meant: I don’t need to tell you, and meant: you already know, and meant: it hurts anyway. “We name them. Jo and Sam and Bright and the one with the nick in his fin we don’t name because you don’t make a friend of a sheep if your job is to have sheep and not eat them.”

“You can say a name like a warning and it works,” I said. “Do you want me to make it taste bad in here for a while.”

He blew out, slow. “They tell me there’s a bitter. I got a cousin who licks batteries for fun. He says he’ll volunteer.”

“Chemists exist,” I said. “We have one. We will enlist her at scale. We will salt our rooms different.”

“Scale,” he said, and then he flushed because he hated the pun and himself for laughing, and we shook on it. I touched the vent and let it decide if it wanted to be a whistle or a siren. It chose whistle because sirens are drama and Como hates drama almost as much as it hates people who don’t put their cups in trash cans. I told the pond three jokes so it would not feel used. The pond told me it had seen a boy at the fence last summer with hair like a wheat field and a face that said every fish here is mine and I told it boys like that are allowed to talk hyperbolic to water as long as they grow into men who replace porch railings.

There is a small door near the conservatory that has been a small door since 1935 and has no interest in promotion. I leaned in, took its temperature, and found the imbalance that meant someone had convinced it to like them. Kettle had gone through like a memory, not a burglar. I tied a thread there not to trap him but to get him to feel my idea of hospitality when he put his hand on it next time. I tucked a bell under the metal shelf where a potted fern performed photosynthesis like theater. It would ring if the air on the other side of the door turned warmer from the inside out. The keeper watched and didn’t ask. A man who lives with fish learns to let someone else do their job if they’re doing it with reverence and a little spite.

On the way out, a kid ran past with cheeks full of questions and slipped and didn’t fall because winter can be generous. His dad caught his sleeve at the right second with two fingers and a prayer. I envied them both for a minute and then didn’t, because envy is a ladder that leads to roofs you have no business being on.

Kettle likes to make an early stop in a day that belongs to him. I went to a place he would try next because men who invent their rooms try to invent their routes. Down on Seventh there is a shop that sells secondhand glass—the kind with edges they tell you are dangerous and the kind old windows sigh through when you lift them. The owner keeps mirrors in a way I admire. She stacks them with space between them so each can believe it is the only one being looked into. Kettle likes mirrors because they season. He had not been yet. He would be. I wrote a note on her counter that said if a man with a wound all wrapped like an apology comes in and he tells you he’s building a room, tell him all your mirrors are spoken for by saints. She read it and said, “I don’t have saints,” and I pointed at the mirrors themselves and she nodded because she does.

I walked, and the city changed its face as it does when it is deciding if it is going to be angry today or accommodating. I put my ear to a mailbox and it told me that the woman on Summit with the hair pins had sent a letter to herself, addressed to the room under the music room, with a check in it and a story she was going to tell on Thursday that would make a man cry in public and pretend he had something in his eye. I put my fingernail under the flap where the glue had been proud of itself and I talked it out of its vanity. The letter stayed. That’s the politeness. But the check forgot where it was going. It would show up later in a pocket where money is less powerful.

By evening I had three calls I had not expected and two I had. Dawn sent me a little bag with hair from a woman who had cut it off because she was done being spoken to by her dead boyfriend. Torvald sent a boy with arms made to carry flour and a loaf that was a sermon about heat. Lucy sent me a photograph of a beaker labeled in a hand so neat it could balance on a glass rim and not fall: Denatonium. She had written under it: I will not use more than necessary. I will hate every drop and the fish will forgive me because I will explain.

I lay down on my floor because my couch had opinions about the day and my bed was still a judge. The old boards rattled the way horses used to when people’s boots were kinder to them. I shut my eyes and tried to think of nothing. Nothing is difficult in cities. The pipes keep putting in a bid. The neighbors’ stoves hold a grudge about being old. The river is never impressed with your goal to be blank. I thought about Kettle saying children would cry at Como and my hand went to the place in my chest that is for knives people I have never met drop into without wiping them first. I got up and put on my coat because the only cure I know for thinking about what a man has promised to take is to go stand where he thinks he will and watch the space without him in it.

Marigold Vane’s house had its lights modestly arranged. The room under the music room breathed even when it should sleep. I could feel it on the sidewalk. It had begun to believe people had left pieces of themselves in its walls and would need to come back to reclaim them. I touched the brick where the kitchen’s heat vent shows itself and it said: he is busy counting. He is counting confessions like coins. He is counting collisions like tips. He is polishing the word pocket on his tongue until it will slide between people and open them without nicking skin.

I went around to the service door because I keep my dignity in larders. The cook looked at me with a face that could slice onions while reading the paper. He poured me coffee and put in it something he kept in a jar with a rubber ring that said December. I told him what Eli had done with the marker and the boy’s mouth and he said a word in a language my grandmother had refused to teach me because she said some rooms deserve their own secrets. We stood there and were quiet in the right way. He told me a mouse had learned to listen and I told him that happens if you keep a kitchen clean enough for guilt.

There are nights in Saint Paul when you can feel the city tilt an imperceptible degree and nothing falls and still you know something would if it had been left on a ledge. This was such a night. I went back to the river because the river knows when to slap your hand and when to hold it. Under the bridge, the gate had an itch like a thought. I opened it and the underplace harrumphed in the way old rooms do when you turn on a light wrong. I sat with my maps and my thread and my three knots and made a small adjustment to each because plans that survive first contact should be distrusted as much as plans that die instantly.

Two knocks came where one should have, and I went cold, because doubles are not my favorite and I do not open doors to two of anything if I can help it. I listened. The second knock had a hurry that the first did not, and when I put my ear to the wood I heard not Kettle and not some city inspector with a conscience newly minted, but a boy who had taught a bell to be honest.

The run up Selby happened under my feet and I watched it from above, which is a trick you should not tell children about. The wind tried to put a hand in my pocket and I told it no in the tone my grandmother reserved for fires that wanted a second log against instructions. Eli’s yard had acquired a ring in the air the way metal acquires one when it wants to show a person their reflection is a liar. The birdhouse bell had rung twice and then lost its nerve. Eli stood where I had told him to. He had both hands on his chest and his face was doing math. His mother stood behind him with a pan because humans aren’t stupid, and it is always good to have a pan when someone with a bad mouth decides to visit.

The grate had tried to refuse and had been told a story it could not argue with. I could smell oil on metal and a little violet because Kettle likes to be theatrical when no one is watching. I got down on my belly without dramatics and put my cheek to the stone. The drain had been coaxed into calling itself a door. I said the word for not yours and the drain said I know that, but he told me a story about rooms and I remembered the time my pipes were new and flattered, and I forgot my job for a second. Drains, like people, want to be important. We have to forgive them for how they choose to do it.

“I have another word,” I said, and this one was from a season where my grandmother had the flu and still made dumplings and I watched the pot and learned the way a boil looks when it’s about to be itself too much. It means: back. Not leave. Back. Like when you put a book where it goes and it admits you have a point. The drain agreed with it, because drains like to be back where they go.

On the other side of the world, a hand with neat white wrapped around it paused the way a hand pauses when the nerve that runs through the palm remembers a mouth. He was there. Not the whole of him; he was too clever for that. He had put a piece of him through to make a point because men who build rooms think they do not have to attend to small points anymore. He flicked his finger against the hair knot I had laid there and it bit him and he admired it and then his breath came through the drain and tried to be a story.

Eli’s bell rang once, not out of duty but out of spite. I grabbed the line and pulled the hair into a tighter grip on the metal so it would remember pain the next time someone flattered it. I leaned close and said, “Leave the boy alone. I will feed you something else.”

It was the wrong promise and I knew it when I said it, but sometimes you give a wrong thing to a mouth to stop it from chewing on the right thing. He tasted the word feed and let his tongue touch his teeth to see if they were sharp enough. “Bread,” he said, amused. “You bake like a troll. You season with names and flour. You are quaint.”

“Quaint saves boys on porches,” I said. “Quaint keeps parks from having to explain absence to children who have not yet been taught how to hate men properly.”

He breathed laughter into the metal and I heard it sing. “You think I will be dissuaded,” he said. “You think a bell in a birdhouse is a wall. You think a child can rename sorrow and I will say thank you and go home to my comfortable rooms.”

“I think you have confused permission with a wardrobe,” I said, and his mouth made a mistake that looked like pure annoyance and that is when you press, always when you have a man angry because he cannot accessorize with impunity. “I think you have put on Marigold Vane like a coat and you plan to hang her up when spring comes and you will go out in a shirt you stole from a newsstand. I think you have built a pocket that has a hole in it and you have not seen it.”

He said nothing for a count of nine. He is not superstitious, but nine does things to a teeth. When he spoke, he leavened it. “Thursday,” he said. “My room. Bring your troll. Bring your barber. Bring your professor with her bitter. Bring the boy with the names if you have no shame. Bring them all. I will serve bread.”

He withdrew himself out of the drain with a sound like a prayer you don’t admit to saying out loud because it might work. The bell quieted. Eli’s breath made two little flags in the cold. I got up and found that my knees had decided to be Protestant about my choices and I told them to relax. Eli looked at me hard.

“He said you would bring me,” he said. “You won’t.”

“I won’t,” I said, because now we were past politeness and into doctrine. “He says many things. He says castle like it’s a dessert and pocket like it’s a kiss you don’t have to pay for. He says bread like he invented it. He will not have you in his room. You will be home with your bell and your names and your mother’s pan and you will learn a new whistle because the world keeps trying to take your mouth and you must give it its own job.”

He stared at the birdhouse and then at me. “He sounds like the man who lives down the block,” he said with the savage accuracy of children. “The one who borrows ladders and doesn’t bring them back and then tells you he improved them for you.”

“Exactly that man,” I said. “Only with velvet.” Eli made a face like a coin that refuses to turn over. We went inside and his mother gave me a casserole on the condition that I return the pan, which is the way love is traded in Saint Paul after six o’clock. I promised to eat it and also to lie about how much salt I put on it so she wouldn’t feel judgment. She looked past me at the yard and the names and we stood together and hoped with the practical shape of hope this city can bear.

On the walk home I stopped under a streetlight that had collected moths in summer and opinions in winter. A bus rolled by with four people inside slumped into their evening like it was a bed they would let themselves be honest in. Marigold’s hill was still lit, a little. The room under the music room had quieted. Kettle was somewhere with a bandage and a theory. I do not believe in men who make rooms for people to tell truths unless they have also made rooms for those same people to sleep without consequence. He had not. He would not, unless the city told him to, and the city could, if we asked right.

I ate half the casserole and left the other half for the version of me that wakes up at three and thinks about doing something unwise with rope. I sharpened a pencil and told it all the reasons not to stab Kettle with it. I wrote on the underside of the table: Thursday, bring Torvald bread and Dawn scissors and Lucy salt and ring the bell after the second violin tune. I added: teach the room to spit. I added: if he makes you tell a story, tell him one he cannot digest. I added: make sure someone you like is at Eli’s house when you do this, not because something will go wrong but because knowing someone you like is sitting on a porch with a pan and a bell makes the world remember itself.

When the night got to the part where trains talk in their sleep and no longer care who hears, there was a noise at my vent like a whisper trying on shoes. I went still. Not fox-still. Pipe-still. The vent coughed politely and gave me a single scale, laid on the floor like a coin from a god. It was not goldfish. It was something else. It had an edge to it that made my fingers revise their ambition. I picked it up and it told me a story about rooms that had eaten confessions and now had a taste for meat. It was not a scale from water. It was a scale from velvet, from the underpart of beauty you aren’t supposed to pry at. I held it in my hand and I said to the table, “We will need a different knot,” and the table said, “I have four legs and you have two hands and you’ve always managed with less.”

I slept an hour and dreamt of a door that opened onto a pocket and the pocket was full of bread and every loaf had a name from a boy’s marker and Kettle stood with his hands clean and said, “Pick,” and I said, “No,” and he smiled because he had cooked the no and it smelled like a lie. I woke with my teeth sore from holding back words. The wind had folded itself under my window and waited, because that is what wind does when a city is about to decide whether it is a room or a street. I put my coat on and my hat that holds worry like a coin, and I went to find the troll because ovens make promises too, and on Thursdays we keep them.Torvald had stacked loaves along his counter like small, benevolent saints. They cooled with the kind of composure you only get after a long rise and a good beating, and the room smelled in a way that makes men who have never apologized consider it. He had flour on his cheek like a finger had reminded him he was loved and he had decided not to wipe it off yet, in case the reminder was necessary again. He looked up when I came in and the air made a place for me the way old shops make a place for people who have spent money and grief within their walls.

“You look like a hinge that’s about to make a choice,” he said, and his voice had the echo of dough being turned out onto wood.

“I need bread that tells the room it has not invented comfort,” I said. “I need crust that says none of this is yours.”

He patted a loaf with the tenderness people reserve for animals who have not decided whether they will bite. “This one has a center that would break a man if he were intent on dishonesty,” he said, and I believed him because trolls do not get poetic unless the thing deserves it. He wrapped two in paper, tied them with thread that had learned patience from his grandmother, and handed them over as if they were tools, not food. “I told the ovens they were allowed to be stubborn about rich houses. They like permission. If the room under the music room draws breath, it will have to share.”

“I tied a bell in a boy’s yard,” I told him. “It rings true. It will bring me. If it rings twice, you will forgive me if I make a scene.”

“Scenes are sometimes efficient,” he said, and his face went soft in a way that made me like him even more. “I sent a boy to stand at the corner near Eli’s house with a newspaper and instructions to pretend to read. He is big enough to be useful and small enough to be ignored and he has a mother who raises bread the way some people raise armies. If the bell rings, he will whistle and I will run.”

“His mother gave me a casserole,” I said.

“She fed me when I came to fix her stove last winter,” he returned, and there are entire philosophies in the way trolls remember who feeds them. “We will be even when the saved boy grows up with ears that know the difference between a room that loves him and a room that wants him to perform.”

Dawn came in while we were still counting, her cheeks wind-made in a way that says the cold numbers you and finds you deserving. She had her scissors in a case like a violinist and a coil of hair with three stubborn colors braided together into a kind of rope a saint would tie around his waist to remind himself not to be vain about miracles. She leaned on the counter with an elbow that reassures wood.

“Have you ever cut velvet,” I asked her, because polite men lead with the relevant question when they invite witches to a house.

“I have cut dresses that believed they were churches,” she said. “Velvet talks big, and then bleeds the same as anything. Where does it stitch.”

“Under the music room,” I said. “It has a selvage that thinks it’s above being seen. I want you to find it and snip like a kindness.”

Her eyes warmed with the kind of joy that has no malice in it and all the mischief. “I will have to pretend to admire Marigold’s orchids,” she said. “I will have to say the word sumptuous without choking. Bring me near a seam and I will do the humble work that makes princes nervous.”

Lucy arrived with a scarf that made her look like a woman prepared to tell a complicated truth to a committee. She carried two small bottles in her pocket and the kind of guilt chemists get when they know they have made a thing that will taste like a lesson. Her hands were steady, and they always would be, because that is what she chose when she chose her life and it had chosen her back.

“This is not poison,” she said before I asked, which told me she had been arguing with herself the whole walk over and had decided to answer questions no one could bear to put in a mouth. “It will not harm. It will taste like regret. If it touches the velvet it will not stain; it will leave a memory that the fabric understands as no. If it touches his tongue it will remind him of a time his mother told him a thing he did not want to hear.”

“Is that safe,” Dawn asked, professional, curious, contained.

“I am not a villain,” Lucy said, and then the corner of her mouth remembered humor. “And even if I were, I am a chemist in Saint Paul. We do not poison rooms; we make them reconsider their choices.” She looked at the bread and the scissors and the thread with hair knotted in, and I saw her realize she was part of a religion she had not known she had joined. “I’ll be at the atrium until nine,” she added to me, “and then I can come for an hour. I have a graduate student who can watch fish with reverence and a timer. If he fails I will fail later and with interest.”

“You like Marigold,” I said, because honesty is a resource like copper and must be mined.

“I like the idea of money behaving itself,” she said. “And I like rooms where people speak and are not devoured. If we can make her room spit rather than swallow, I will like that more.” She tucked the bottles deeper into her pocket, checked that they could not betray her by clinking, and set her mouth the way you do when you are going to stand in a space that resents you and correct it gently anyway.

We parceled out the night like a recipe that had to be adapted for a different pan. Torvald would walk the hill at five and let the ovens speak when I whistled; he would stand in the service doorway and make the kitchen acknowledge its complicity. Dawn would slide in at seven with a woman who wants an updo and leave by eight with hair in her pocket that would make a knot into a tab you can pull if the evening gets out of hand. Lucy would come at nine with a scarf and a line about donors and air and the way buildings are made of molecules and manners. I would thread what needed threading. Jao would watch Eli with a radio turned low to an old song and a pan of coffee. The boy with the newspaper would whistle if necessary, and the neighbor’s dog would wag and pretend he did not see demons. It was as good as plans get in a town that knows how to shrug without giving up.

Marigold opened her door to the city at dusk like a person who has just discovered a doorbell and intends to wear it well. The lights were gentle and flattering without respect. A woman in a dress that wanted to be in a painting laughed on the front steps and touched another woman’s arm in a way that said I forgive you because you are me. Men in shirts that had convinced themselves they were uniforms lifted glasses and looked relieved to see one another because finally someone had sold them a place where they would not have to start from scratch. I slipped in through the service entry because that is where dignity enters a house.

The kitchen had decided to be stern with me. Theater cooking makes honest kitchens feel judged. The cook gave me a roll with no butter and a look that said he had been eavesdropping with skill and had chosen mercy. I ate like a thief and put my hand on the stove and told it if it had to go on strike a little tonight I would tell the union it had a case.

The room under the music room breathed its new name in the walls. Pocket, pocket, pocket. It was learning its inventory. I walked the hall along the back of the house where the plaster had a memory of being sanded by someone who took pride in his forearms. There was an access panel I had not met before; it did not want to be met. I told it my grandmother’s joke and it coughed and let me pass with the kind of begrudged goodwill that keeps buildings honest. Under, in, between—goblin cardinal directions that do not show up on maps unless we draw them with our fingers on someone else’s fogged-up glass.

The velvet was hung, and it had decided to like itself. It had taken in two dozen conversations and had the beginning of a palate. It preferred regret with pepper. It found stories about fathers easier to digest than ones about daughters. It liked the way money sounds when it apologizes for being money. It was a child with new teeth and an appetite for things sweeter than broth. I slid my hand behind it and found the strip where the fabric thinks it will not be seen. It was stitched to a kindness that had cost twice what it should have. I tied a hair knot there, small and mean and holy. Dawn came and stood in the doorway like a woman who has shoes and a mission and I brought my fingers down and pointed.

She moved like water that knows how to take a shape without breaking the cup. She lifted the velvet with two fingers as if she were lifting a cat out of a lap that had forgotten it had a meeting. She made one careful cut where the selvage thought itself immune. The cut was nothing, it was less than a cough, it was the kind of correction you make to your collar before walking into the room where you will humiliate a man by knowing more history. The velvet shifted. It realized it had a run in it and took a breath that moved through the fabric like embarrassment through a crowd. Dawn bent her head and bit off the hanging thread with a practical mouth and patted the place she had hurt with an apology that would keep the wound from getting infected.

“Thursday,” she murmured, and that was not information; it was benediction. She slid out, leaving the air sharper than she had found it and the room too aware of its own hem.

Torvald stood in the kitchen and did not fit and did not care. He had an apron the cook had thrown at him with affection that would be denied later. He held a towel in his hand with the confidence of a man who can grab a hot pan and not make a sound. He looked at me and I whistled once, very low, very long, and the ovens in houses along Summit repositioned their attention like horses when someone says whoa and means it. The bread smell rose like a theory from the basement of a university and took the stairs two at a time. It arrived at the mouth of the pocket with manners that were still too present to be trusted. People’s shoulders dropped back into their bodies. Someone said oh without dressing it up.

Kettle had the room already. He stood where the first confession would naturally arc and hit the wall and sit, and he held his cup as if cups are fragile and he is not. He wore a bandage with a flourish, which is to say he had learned how to turn a mistake into jewelry. He wore a suit that believed itself to be an argument. He smiled with the wrong half of his mouth and it worked on people who had taught themselves to love the wrong half of things.

“Welcome,” he said, and the velvet became a congregation. “This is a pocket. You come here to put your hand in and find what you left behind. You come here to leave something that will make you lighter to carry.” His tie sat in his throat like a vote he intended to win by speaking. The room sighed and the sigh came back dressed as enthusiasm. “Tonight we will taste,” he added, and there was the slightest flicker in his eyes toward the vent that hid my bell like a polite dog behind a couch.

Lucy arrived quietly like excellent habits. She had a coat that made her look colder than she was on purpose. She took a place near a plant that breathed with punctuality and she pressed the tiniest release of bitter onto the back of her own hand like a woman testing perfume at a counter she does not intend to buy from. She lifted her hand to her lip and learned the word no again and nodded and I loved her a little for being capable of following her own instructions. She pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and touched the wall as if she were adjusting a child’s hair before a photograph. She left a trace of denatonium like a new etiquette. It would not last forever, but it would be there when a mouth brushed up against the wall preparing to swallow the room whole.

Marigold glowed. It is a thing women do when they have built something they believe will outlast their decisions. She floated and she anchored and she entertained without the meanness that sometimes climbs onto the shoulders of hostesses without asking for a ride. When she saw me, she flicked an eyebrow and smiled like a woman who can afford to be curious about a goblin. I nodded at her the way men nod at bridges—respect, appreciation, a private calculation of whether the rivets are honest.

The first confession came from a man with a jaw that had learned humility late and too fast. He said he had been cruel to his brother because his brother was happy and he had not known what to do with the shape of another man’s joy. The room tasted it and approved. The velvet warmed under it the way flesh does under a hand that is allowed to be there. The second was a woman who admitted she wrote her husband’s emails because his grammar made her heart itch and that she had forgotten how to tell a sentence of her own without his name in it. The velvet took that and purred. The bread smell rose and made them both correct their posture and sit back so the chairs could have them properly.

Kettle moved through the pockets of people and arranged them without touching. He had built the rhythm of the room like a pickpocket builds a route; you would not feel your wallet go missing and you would double back willingly to the corner where the trick had been done to watch it again and be parted from something else. He took a glass from a woman’s hand and put it down and she thanked him for it. He laughed at something that was not a joke and men who had never been allowed to laugh that soft laughed too, and you could feel them falling in love with what they thought was permission.

The bell in the vent kept its word. It rang when conversations got to the part where a person thinks their humiliation is a gift and forgets that gifts come wrapped and with a card that says who they are for. It pressed a single tone into the soundproof and made the walls confess they were walls. Heads turned. Smiles faltered and then decided not to, and that was enough of a disruption to make Kettle have to work for it. He does not like to work. Men like that think effort is vulgar when the room has promised to do their lifting for them.

He lifted a small covered dish from a tray as if he were officiating at an altar and not an evening. I saw his left hand flex, the line of the bandage remember me without admitting it. He took the cover off and there were orange slips inside, not fish, not meat, not even fruit, but the idea of it—the flavor of a thing you tell yourself is permissible because it has lost its bones. He meant to take the memory of fish into his mouth in front of a room and let the velvet watch him invent appetite as a sacrament.

Lucy was there with her handkerchief on the wall and her face set like a beaker that refuses to boil. She had a bottle in her pocket and she was not going to use it in a way that would make anyone else’s choice for them. She breathed out. I breathed in. Torvald, in the doorway, lifted a bread knife and set crumbs free. Dawn slipped along the edge and leaned to a woman’s ear, and you could feel the woman’s hair rearrange its loyalties.

Kettle took his little offering of what he had convinced himself was not harm, and he raised it to his mouth in a motion that, if he had been someone decent, might have been a blessing. He let it touch his tongue. The velvet shivered because it knew it was about to be fed what it wanted. The bitter was there. It was not a slap. It was a memory. It was a taste that said not now and not like this and you should be ashamed of thinking this was yours. He jerked and did not, because he is very good at performance, but his mouth closed with a small, involuntary honesty. He swallowed wrong. His eyes, for a second, had in them regret he had not paid for. The room breathed in. He let himself cough once—stagecraft, redone as reality—and smiled as if he were pleased to be corrected by a house he was trying to own.

“Bread,” he said, smooth, and Torvald made the air full of it. It rolled into the pocket with the authority of ovens that have seen wars and weddings and said yes exactly the same way to both. People took plates and let their hands practice ordinary, generational motions. Butter went on crust with modesty. Salt went on butter with confidence. The conversation shifted into a key the velvet could not memorize quick enough to mimic and, frustrated, it sulked like a cat denied a lap.

“Delicious,” said Marigold, half to herself, and it was not the food she meant. It was the feeling of having held back what would have taken everything and called it hospitality. She looked at me and then at the corner where the fabric had a run it was trying to hide even from itself. She put her fingers there and felt it and I watched comprehension lift her shoulders the way a tight corset never could. In that second she was more root than leaf, more foundation than copper, more woman than hostess, and her money did something decent in her face.

“You are a guest,” she said to Kettle without lowering her voice. It was a sentence spoken by a person who has read her own name on deeds and letters for years and has decided to make new notes in the margin. “You are welcome in guest rooms. You will not put walls under my music room without telling me what they intend. This house has rooms for truth that was not invited, and they are called kitchens, and I respect them, and they do not require velvet.” She smiled as if she had said something small and not sacrilege to a religion she had nearly converted to.

The bow-tied man with ash in his tray adjusted his opinions as if they were cufflinks, and his eyes went to Kettle because he had made a habit of investing in other people’s appetites and was checking whether this one would continue to pay dividends. The velvet listened, because velvet is vain but not stupid, and this was the first time it had been told in a tone it understood that it had a limit and should be grateful for it.

Kettle stood quiet and his mouth considered rage and chose something colder because rage in a pocket only feeds the pocket. He tipped his head and the bandage flashed and you could see him rewrite his sentence. He leaned toward me as if confiding to a man who reminds him of a first error.

“You have made a room into a kitchen,” he said, low enough to be meant as intimacy and loud enough to be meant as humiliation. “You have taken a banquet and served toast. You will be thanked by people who do not understand what is possible.”

“Possible is overrated,” I said, and the floor under our feet released a knot I had tied and made him feel, briefly, that he was shorter than he had hoped. “Survivable is my preferred cuisine.” I stepped to the vent and put my lips to the seam and invited the bell to tell the room it was time to breathe out. It rang one polite, true, sufficient note and the velvet realized it had taken more into itself than it could carry with grace. It exhaled. It spit. It did not vomit a tangible thing—it released a breath that was stale and selfish and you could smell the names in it. People winced, not at the odor, but at the recognition. The room owned its appetite and the room confessed. It is hard to be seduced by a room that just told you it is hungry for you.

Marigold did not look away. She touched the fabric where Dawn had cut and felt where the lie had turned to simple cloth. “Tomorrow,” she said, and the room learned the thing it hates most, which is logistics. “We will take down the hangings. We will leave plaster and paint. We will let the walls be walls. We will let music go through them as it must, imperfect and generous. Mr. Kettle,” she added with a smile that had been honed on fundraisers and funerals, “you will be paid for the work that can be undone without harm. You will not be paid for harm.”

He bowed because bows are what you do when teeth would get you a bill for a new carpet. He kissed her hand in the air above her hand because he does not know how to leave without touching and she does not know how to be touched by a man who thinks he can buy the practice. He turned his head and looked at me with something like disappointment and something like respect and something like a long winter night he is planning to spend writing my name down in categories he understands.

“You have cost me a room,” he said. “You have bought yourself a city for another week.”

“This city was already mine,” I said, and the lamps approved because they like a man who knows what he belongs to.

He went, not out the door with the other guests but into the corridor that thinks it is discreet. I went after him because politeness sometimes requires an escort, especially when the man is walking away from a thing he called a castle and has to measure his back. The hallway held still. The kitchen thought about slamming a pan and decided not to. The service door breathed like a person who has chosen not to tell a secret until morning.

“Leave the boy,” I said to his shoulder. “Leave the fish. Leave the park. Devour your own confession if you must; the rest of us need ours to live.”

He didn’t stop. He is not the kind who grants you the gift of movement, but he did tilt his head, and that is how you know a person has granted you comprehension. “Do you know what it costs to be the man who tells truths in rooms,” he asked the door frame. “Do you know what it costs to be the mouth everyone thinks is a drain for their guilt. If I am not fed, I become thin, and thin men are cruel without artistry.”

“You do not have the monopoly on cost,” I said. “You invented a place where people hand you names. That is inexpensive. Go home. Build a wall without velvet in it. Teach yourself to sit in a kitchen and be quiet and wash dishes and be never thanked and attend to how it changes your throat.”

He laughed the way iron laughs when someone tells it a poem. He looked back with the kind of smile you use on a child you are about to teach a lesson you yourself failed at. “You will not always be there,” he said. “A room will open. A bell will be on the far side of the city. A boy will fall asleep on a porch, and I will help him wake up to reality.”

“We do not define reality the same way,” I said, and I did not explain my version because some kindness is not for men who chew it. He let himself out through a hinge that has been complimented too often and did not return my nod to the night.

In the room, people went on with their bread because the city is wise and requires mouth occupations when hard things happen. Dawn had a handful of hair she had not trimmed from any person there and she tucked it into her sleeve as if storing a gentler future. Torvald leaned on the door and took a bite of a heel like a sacrament and closed his eyes. Lucy put her hand on the wall again with her handkerchief and wiped away a residue that would have made anyone else feel righteous and made her feel like cleaning, which is a better theology. Marigold instructed the contractor to bring men at nine and I heard in his eyes the calculation, the grudging respect, the relief of a man who will not have to explain to his wife why their sheets smell like expensive glue.

I stepped to the vent and let my breath tell the bell to rest. It settled, and with it my own pulse, which had been trying to do too much for too long. The velvet learned its first lesson about limits. The room forgot its name long enough to become a room. Chairs relaxed in their legs. People remembered coats and parking and the way nighttime at street level smells like the city forgiving them.

On Selby the wind had reheated its leftover arguments and was serving them politely. I cut down the alley with bread under my arm and a plan in my coat and a kind of fatigue that lives in men who spend rooms without killing them. Under the bridge, the river made small teeth against its ice and called them music because the word comes cheap and we can afford it. I went to Eli’s and found Jao on the porch with a mug and a face that said he had revised his opinion of the wind several times and had landed on tolerable.

“It rang once,” he said, without moving his eyes from the yard. “And then not again. I used the radio to call songs older than you and the dog next door agreed with my taste. The boy taught me a whistle. He was very tired and very polite, which is what life is like sometimes.”

The bell in the birdhouse was quiet and content in the way of objects that have done their work correctly and know it. The tags on the stones lifted a little in the draft of the night and I read Grout and Car Payment and Shoe with a respect I have never been able to muster for poems that do not sit under benches. Eli’s mother had left a porch light on with the exact amount of commitment you need not to make a man outside feel surveilled. I left two slices of Torvald’s bread wrapped in paper and a note that said names are still names even when they are ugly, and then I went home and sat on my couch because victory is not the same as rest and beds have rules I had not won the right to break.

In the night I woke to the idea of velvet trying to grow under the floorboards and found my hand around my own throat until I realized I had slept on a thread and it had made a mark. I rose and took the velvet scale I had found at my vent and dropped it into a jar with salt from Dawn and a coin with a hole and a name Lucy had written on a label with neatness. The jar sang like the inside of a teapot. The sound meant: not yet, and also: not never, which is how these stories end when they are honest.

In the morning, the hill had ladders on it. Men stood on them with steadiness that made the world better. Marigold had coffee brought to people whose shirts did not cost as much as the rug they were taking down and she thanked them in a voice that was not defensive for once. The velvet went, rolled, carried, boxed, stored, or stormed, I would not know which until someone I know sees it show up in a hotel dining room in a different town and calls me with the news. The wall under the music room exhaled something that had got stuck there the night before and became blank, which is a gift.

I went to Torvald and returned the knife because he is the one who brings you home to yourself when you have handled heat too long. He listened to me recount less than half and said, “Good,” and cut bread and handed it across the counter to a woman who was going to her sister’s divorce and needed to show up with something honest. I went to Dawn and she cleaned her scissors like a priest and said, “If he puts velvet anywhere else I will hear it. That fabric gossips. It does not know how not to.” I went to Lucy and she stood by her pond with a student who took notes on fish and asked questions about feelings they are not sure their professors are allowed to have.

“He will try again,” she said. Her coat had shut the world out until it was ready to be let in and it had decided it was not yet ready. “Not here. Somewhere else. He will keep inventing pockets until he learns that pockets are for hands, not mouths.”

“We will keep letting rooms be rooms,” I said. “We will let kitchens do their old work. We will ring bells where we have to. We will name things badly when it helps.”

She smiled at that, and the pond rippled as if it understood joke as a solution and not a distraction. The fish remembered how to be fish. The air remembered how to be air. The hinge on the maintenance door decided to squeak in broad daylight because sometimes the thing you hide at night is not really a secret, it is just a chore you should have gotten to sooner.

I went to Como and the keeper had a ledger where he was writing with a pencil that had decided to be serious for a morning. He saw me and nodded and said, “No monks missing,” and I nodded back and put my hand on the rail around the water and told it thank you for not making me invent more tricks. He added, “If your man tries, we will be impolite together,” and I felt something in my back unclench that had been tensed since the first tooth on the table.

That afternoon I sat under the bridge and took the jar with the velvet scale and set it on the table and told it a story about loyalty. It hummed, a little off-key, and settled. Above me the city made noises you only hear when it is thinking about how to apologize. Somewhere Kettle was finding a mirror that allowed him to smooth his tie in a way that comforted him. Somewhere a woman looked at her couch and decided to sit in her kitchen instead and did not know why. Somewhere a boy threw snow at a mailbox and hit the number just right and believed he had magic for a second and he was right.

I could have stopped there and called it a day I had earned. There are days we survive and that is a feast. But the wind in Saint Paul had taken up residence again in the corners and folded itself in, waiting. It waits to see what you make of the fact that nothing is finished and the room you made spit will learn to swallow again if you are arrogant. It waits to see if you will tie your thread to something that will outlast you and trust that you will not be the one to tug it loose. It waits for the night you cannot be two places and for the bell you cannot hear. It waits for the man with the bandaged hand to find a new way to say pocket that makes the walls forget themselves.

I had bread crumbs in my coat pocket and salt in my hair and the smell of violet in my nose from a room that had nearly practiced a new religion. I wrote on the underside of my table: he will try the places I am not. Then I wrote: teach someone else the whistle. Then I wrote: be home sometimes. The chalk under my fingernails made a sound like a hinge being credited for good behavior. The kettle breathed to itself like a god with a small congregation that had finally asked the right question. The list under my table scratched something in my language that means not today, but I knew better than to pretend it had ever meant no forever.The day after the ladders went up and came down and Marigold Vane’s house remembered that walls are perfectly respectable naked, I taught the whistle to people who already knew it with their hands and just needed the tune. You can’t teach a whole city, not even ours, but you can stand in a union hall that smells like mop water and coffee burned the right amount and find the members who hold the keys to places no one sees and tell them a thing that feels like an old habit. They were custodians and night porters and the kind of security that knows your name because you are always five minutes late and they warm the door for you. Reina from the skyways had shoulders that turned winter into a polite suggestion, and a laugh that made a trash bin decide to roll itself three inches to be helpful. I showed her the sliver of sound under the railroad, and she showed me how to tap a plunger once against the floor to make a vent go quiet and stop telling your business. We traded. I told them the boundary word my grandmother used for flames that believed in themselves too much, and they told me which doors downtown are too proud and which doors are grateful and which ones long to be treated with gentleness because their hinges are old and nobody ever asks them how their day went. I wrote nothing down. Writing is for after, when the room has already become decent.

He did not leave us the courtesy of a week. The city is quiet in January, but it is a quiet with ears, and one afternoon the ears heard pockets speaking the wrong dialect. A rash of small vanishments walked Selby and Wabasha. Keys forgot their job and went on strike in great, jangling bundles. Coins shied away from pay boxes with the prim disgust of people who had been told the bus is for other people. Jacket linings unstitched themselves with the embarrassed zeal of novices and presented what they held to the nearest mouth. When men put their hands into their coats for confidence, they came up with lint and a feeling like heat lightning—nothing you could hand over, everything that made you swallow. He had found a new seam. He didn’t need velvet on walls when he could line the inside of a hundred pockets with a thin green that would never see daylight and would still taste of confession. He had become a king of pockets by remembering that pockets are homes, not just holes, and then breaking the lease on all of them at once.

I tried to pay cash for a loaf in Torvald’s shop and the coin would not leave my palm. It adhered like an apology and then slid away and pattered to the floor with a sound that told me my own coat had been told a story about who owned it. I reached for thread and found that my pockets, the ones I trust like cousins with spare bedrooms, had been stitched closed with a neatness I could not match on purpose. It was like waking up with your mouth politely taped after an argument you don’t remember losing. I sat on a crate in Torvald’s back room and the crate said, this is a good day to be wood. I took my comb and coaxed the stitches out, sure and slow, every snag a prayer for patience. My grandmother used to say that when the world sews your pockets shut it is telling you to leave your hands free for something besides counting. I do not always obey her when I should, but I know a liturgy when it walks through my door, and I preached at my own coat until it opened itself and apologized like a hinge in spring.

Reina called from the skyway with a voice that had lost none of its humor and all of its permission. “They’ve built a parlor in the bend between the eye clinic and the bank,” she said. “Nothing visible. Nothing you could bring a complaint to. But the glass is breathing in and not out, and the trash cans are saving their gossip instead of letting it go to the truck, and there is a bench that thinks it is velvet and keeps asking me if I want to sit and tell it why I leave my lights on when I’m not home.”

You forget the skyways until you don’t. In summer they are a convenience for people who don’t like to admit winter is a person. In cold like this, they are arteries, they are arguments, they are the way we pretend we aren’t a river town with honest wind and honest gulls. They hook corner to corner with their heads cocked, and at night they sing a faint high song that sounds like all the words you said under your breath when you thought the meeting should have ended ten minutes ago. I went up at dusk on the stairs that never mean to be a surprise and always are, and the city laid itself flat beneath the glass like a map you could read if you stood very still and listened to the bus brakes the way you listen to a poem when you don’t know if you like it yet. The skyway glass fogged as I approached because it had heard about me and wanted to see whether I was still as impolite as I had been last time. I put my palm on the pane and told it a story about ropes between ships and kindness between strangers, and it cleared its throat and let me see.

He hadn’t hung velvet; he had taught the walkway to impersonate it. A pocket is not a thing of cloth only. It is a promise you make with a seam. He had laid seams in an invisible curve under the glass where people set their lunch bags down when they take a phone call and hide their face. He had charmed the benches to keep names like confetti under their slats. He had convinced the trash cans that they were banks and secrets were deposits that earned interest if you didn’t look at them. People had started to stop there as if by accident. They turned their bodies toward the glass without knowing. They put their hands in their own coat and sighed and then looked lighter and didn’t know why they were colder.

Reina came up with a cart like a small boat and a mop that knew where the floor wanted attention. She nodded in the direction of a corner where a potted tree had grown into the shape the space had dreamed it should be. “There,” she said. “He doesn’t need a velvet wall if he has a plant with aspirations.” She watched me put my head against the glass the way men do when they remember a tune and are ashamed of what it makes them think of. “I can make it louder at night,” she added. “Vacuuming is an occult art.”

We did not go at it like heroes. We went like people who work for a living. She let me into the maintenance closet that powers a hundred acceptable compromises. The vacuums sat with their mouths open like dogs trying to be helpful. The door leaned out of the way and whispered, I hate being here and I love being useful. We tied one bell to a loop of hose and one to the handle of the mop and one very small one to the end of a spool of fishing line I do not use for fish. If a pocket is built in a place where people pass, you don’t try to tear it out in front of them; you teach the place to cough at the right time. Reina whistled my sliver and the ducts shivered like a horse tossed its mane, and the breath of the walkway went from inhale-only to a healthier mix.

He was there, of course, because he is a man who counts his little conquests the way some people count the days since last snow. I saw him only in reflections at first, in three panes, angled, the way a room makes you a kaleidoscope if it likes you. He leaned with his bandaged hand in his pocket like it was a pocket because he had decided it was and nothing in his life had yet told him no two days in a row. He talked to a bench with the confidence of one who believes furniture has waited for him to come home. The bench, to its shame, was flattered. He saw me in the pane on the right and smiled in the pane on the left and never looked me in the original because men like him don’t like to be seen without the flattering glass between. He wiggled the fingers of his wrapped hand at me in a friendly way that made my teeth want to throw a plate.

“Good evening,” he said, not turning, and the walkway carried his words along itself and underoted them. “You have very industrious friends.”

“You have very lazy morals,” I said, and Reina coughed, and the cough rang the bell on the vacuum and made a sound that in most cultures means we are interrupting something before it gets complicated. A man down the hall forgot his sentence and had to start over, and in the restart he decided not to say the thing he was going to say about his wife three floors above, and he took his hand out of his coat pocket like a man remembering his promises.

He moved his head fractionally so the pane offered me the clean line of his cheek when he pretends to be capable of regret. “This is gentler,” he said. “They will tell their truths on their way home without getting their coats off. They will not make a pilgrimage. They will not become performances. They will be relieved and buy a coffee, and the city will thank me by thinking better of itself.”

“You have taught a hallway to act like your mouth,” I said, and I watched the glass decide whether to fog and then decide that tonight it would rather be a mirror because it wanted to see if it could make me misbehave. “You are still eating what is not yours.”

He lifted a hand, not the wrapped one, and smoothed an invisible wrinkle in the air. “I am hosting,” he said. “Again. You cannot begrudge a man hospitality when the weather is this earnest.”

Reina checked the time the way people who work evenings become priests of time. She tapped the mop once and the pipes took a breath that was not Mr. Kettle’s. “The sandwich shop closes in ten,” she said into the air, and the air accepted the information as doctrine and started telling people to take their last sips. I set a hair knot in the seam under the sill where he had convinced the walkway to tuck itself, and the knot bit into a bit of arrogance and held like a small saint.

He walked, smooth, to the bend where through the glass you can see the Target sign pretend to be the sunset on short days, and put his bandaged hand flat against the pane as if he could push his idea through and patent the river. The glass did not accept patents; it has a union. He kept talking, for me, ostensibly for himself, actually for the city which he believes reads him the way gulls read bread. “This place collects lint and promises,” he said. “I am only improving it with a little purpose. Don’t be provincial because you like kitchens. Some of us prefer shoes.”

“Shoes carry you into kitchens if you love anyone worth the effort,” I said, and I made a note in my head that some day I would like to cook him the kind of soup that teaches your tongue humility. “You are going to start losing, Kettle, in small ways that seem beneath your notice. Your benches will prefer holding heavy things to hearing light ones. Your trash cans will develop boundaries. Your glass will fog on you and you will think it is a failed seal, and really it is the city refusing to let you improve it without consent.”

He smiled in the left pane again because he cannot let go of a trick that makes people go soft around him. “Consent,” he said in a tone that has ruined men, “is a story we tell ourselves when we have decided it is too late to be choosy.”

Reina banged the vacuum into the baseboard in a way that was not an accident and everything in the walkway jumped as if someone had said the wrong name at dinner. She said, very politely, to a bench, “You’re for sitting, darling, not for sucking,” and the bench went scarlet in the upper rung of its mind and made itself perfectly horizontal so no confessions would slide off and hide under it. A man in a coat that cost the amount of a month’s groceries adjusted his scarf and chose not to unburden himself of the thing he always unburdened when this corridor offered him privacy; he carried it home and tried the kitchen table with the lemon oil, and his wife did not mind because she had been bracing for once and he had turned toward her and not toward the city like an apostle. Small, beneath notice, except to the city, which is a fanatic for these kinds of conversions.

He did not stay to be bored by my plan. He left by going thin and slipping through the seam between glass and frame that a man in a suit cannot see and a goblin takes personally. I pressed my fingers against the damp he left and whispered the word for back into it, and the damp decided to dry where it stood as if on principle. Reina and I stood in the walkway and watched our own reflections try to make us behave. She pointed to the corner where the seams had gone tight and said, with no triumph and all satisfaction, “I am going to make it hard to sweep here for a week.”

He changed tactics again that night, because when you tell a man like that no in one language he will try another, and the new language he tried was municipal. You have not lived until you have watched a city hall filing cabinet fall in love with a man’s pseudonym. The permits office is a sleepy theater with one outstanding actor and six saints who make sure the coffee is not poison. I went in through the second door on the right that believes it is the first door on the left and said to the receptionist’s stapler, help, and the stapler cheered up and showed me its teeth. The woman who owns the stapler had a cardigan that had sat through more meetings than the judges at a fiddle contest. Her name was Inez, and it looked good written in block letters or looped cursive, and she had eyes that said I know the names people give themselves when they are buying their own birthday presents.

“He files as three people,” she told me when I asked for Kettle without asking for Kettle. “One is a man. One is a concept. One is a limited liability you could park your guilt in for a year before the meter would notice. We love concepts here. They don’t yell.” She slid a folder across without sliding it because she was not supposed to and we were not having this conversation and I will fight anyone who suggests that city workers are not artists. “He has a conditional for occupancy in a non-assembly space, proposed use ‘pocket salon’ in captain’s handwriting that does not know the words it wrote. He has an application pending to line a corridor with fabric that breathes under the category ‘sound amelioration.’ He has three letters of support from people who never come to hearings, which made me suspicious and then made me sigh.”

“Does he have a name he forgot to hide,” I asked, running my finger along the brass on the drawer to make it feel admired. Brass likes a compliment; it keeps it from teaming up against you.

“He forgot you,” she said, and there was a little thrill in her mouth because in a town this small pettiness is a spice we ration. “He left the signature line blank on one application and the hand that filled it later wrote in a different century. I tell you as a woman who has made a life looking at what men say they sign, this is not his legal. It is the man with the bow tie who buys ash trays. It’s half caution and half laziness.”

“I will bring him a cookie,” I said. “And ask him why he thinks rooms are improved by eating.”

“If you do,” she said, and handed me a stack of notices that had not been mailed yet because the envelopes were sulking, “give him this one instead. He missed his reinspection for the work at 132 West Seventh, second floor, suite that used to be a dentist and now thinks it is important.” She wrote on it in neat print, see you Thursday, and underlined Thursday twice, because even secular offices have devotions.

The suite on Seventh had old tile that had tried to remember teeth and failed. The waiting room knew a certain level of anxiety as its baseline and was grateful whenever someone who spoke in a different key came to sit for a minute, even if the someone had a bandaged hand and a laugh that thought it could soften everything in the world if you just let it talk long enough. He had hung velvet here, not on the walls—they were dead and noble—but in the pockets of the coats on the rack. You do not expect your coat to betray you while it is at leisure. People will leave fifty dollars lying around and guard it with suspicion, but hang a jacket with their whole self in the lining on a shared peg and forget it, because you cannot live if you suspect your own pockets. He had sewed a ribbon of green into the hem of each coat while their owners looked at their phones. Not visible. Not testable. A seam that told the fabric to warm when certain words were spoken. Names, mostly. The names your mother called you when she wanted a better version of you without breaking your heart.

I stood there and watched coats. If you want to learn faith, watch coats. They hold us together and give us up and keep us warm and go on without applause. I took my comb and made the smallest nick in the velvet thread on a brown wool that had earned its cuffs every winter since a mortgage, and I said quietly to it, you are a coat, not a confession stand, and the coat glowed with relief and adjusted its shoulders on the peg like a man remembering his posture. I moved along the row, and as I nicked and whispered, the waiting room made the sound rooms make when someone finally tells them what they are for. It is nothing you would hear if you were human and just human. If you’ve got even a little goblin in you, it’s the sound bread makes when you turn it out and it realizes it held its shape.

He came in while I had a mouthful of thread because of course he did. He did not startle. He doesn’t. He looked at me bent over a coat with my head cocked like a barber about to do a difficult ear and smiled in the mirrors along the hall because he requires an audience even when the audience is furniture. “You are industrious,” he said. “Do you not get bored of being the janitor of the soul.”

“Never,” I said, not looking up because men like him believe being looked up at is consent. “Do you not get tired of being an efficient plague.”

He put his hand on a coat, not to steal, just to be family. “I give people ease where they have none,” he said, and remembered the taste of bitter in his mouth and for a second hated me with a clarity I enjoyed. “You would have them shiver first and then be good.”

“I would have the people you eat sleep afterward,” I said, and then, because he needed to be told and the coats needed me to say it, “You are not a priest. You are a host. Hosts do not get to keep the cups.”

He touched his bandage to his thigh as if reminding the place of its story and went toward the room that had been a dentist and now wanted to be a green pocket with a brass lamp. I let him go, because you cannot block every door for a man who knows how to make more. I threaded Dawn’s hair through the coat pegs and secured it with Torvald’s tie of twine. It wasn’t a trap. It was a reminder. The next time the seams warmed and tried to take a name, they would feel their own fabric insist they were clothing and not theater. It would slow him and shame him and a shame that is not public is a shame that sometimes works.

Thursday came again because the week refuses to believe in remission, and the city had already set its mouth in that we’re-doing-things-are-we way that means good and bad walk close. Marigold sent me a photograph of a wall in her basement with plaster drying like a saint in a warm church; she had put her hand flat on it while it was damp and left the print as if to say I own this without owning you. Lucy had paperclipped three letters to me that all said, in different handwritings, I do not want to put bitter into my pond and I will if I must, and I answered each with the promise that the taste passes and the lesson stays and I will come scrub the glass with her on Saturday until both of us forgive ourselves. Torvald sent a roll under a boy’s arm with the instruction that it be delivered to a woman at the corner of Dale and Grand who had given him a coat ten years ago and who needed to remember why she did it. Dawn left a comb wrapped in tissue on my mat with a note that said, if he changes his hair I will know it before his mirror does.

We met the skyway again at twilight, because that is the hour pockets hope to eat in peace. Reina had arranged her cart like a military band. The vacuums hummed with the contentment of two hours well spent. The trash cans had their lids jauntily to one side to disguise the fact that we had knotted bells under the lip. We had agreed, without saying it for fear of drama, that if the pocket in the glass tried to be a mouth tonight we would make it cough and cough until it had to breathe the same air as the rest of us.

He arrived from the direction of the bank, because something about money makes him believe he has a flair when he turns corners near it. He was not alone. The bow-tied man from the hill had practiced look-innocent and was using his face as a rally. Behind him came people with their hands already in their coats, because the night had told them the hallway had softened. He would do some remark about how hard the day is, someone would offer a piece of themselves, and he would collect the garnish and go home with pockets full of the good line he had licked clean. He had brought a musician, too, not a violin this time but a woman with a small drum and a hand that knew how to make your heart think it had a second rhythm it had forgotten. He was spreading out, not because he needed to, but because expansion is his theology.

I stood at the bend, pretending to read a flyer for a blood drive. I have never given blood and I am ashamed of it and my blood knows why, and if you ask me I will tell you a story about a clinic when I was nineteen and you will forgive me because I tell it well and I will still not go. He stopped far enough away for the glass to preserve his aura and raised his wrapped hand in salute like a man who has no intention of fighting today and intends for everyone to know it.

“Don’t,” I said to the glass, not to him, and the glass leaked just a little fog and he looked at his reflection and saw what he hates most, which is the bit of himself that does not want to be clever, only warm.

He opened his mouth like a host to announce the evening’s flavor, and the trash cans, obedient to Reina and affronted by the tone he’d used on them last night, rang their bells one by one with the tone of a bar calling last call for drinkers who should not have had the first. The musician smiled because music never minds competition if it is honest competition. People’s hands came out of their pockets in a wave that was not dramatic if you were watching it with a camera and was a revolution if you were the kind of creature who has to count men’s fingers to know what room he is in. Reina made the mop say a sentence about buckets and the hallway made the sound of an ordinary place doing its job.

He stayed. He always stays when he can make staying look like a favor. He took off his tie and slipped it into a pocket and patted the pocket as if to check that it belonged to him, and for a second it did, because objects have a hard time saying no to a hand that pets them with confidence. Then the knot Dawn had taught me to love bit the seam and the pocket recoiled like a cat that had just been reminded it is attached to a body. His face did not show the pain. He is a good host. He turned and said to the bow tie, “There’s bread across the river,” and I loved him a little for not being able to bear losing two nights in a row in the same way and needing to deflect. The bow tie looked at me the way men in a hurry look at stoplights and chose to be late for once.

We did not win the skyway entirely. That is not how these stories go, however neat you make your knots. On the edge of the bend, a woman in a gray coat told a truth to the glass and left with her shoulders easy, and I could not find anything in me to call that theft, exactly. Room is room; sometimes a pocket forgets to swallow and the person walks away feeling better and no damage is done. It is Kettle’s hunger I mind, not relief itself. I walked the glass and told it, thank you, and it told me, you’re welcome, and I told it, behave, and it told me, try me, because glass is cocky even on its good days.

When I got home my couch had been blessed with crumbs and my kettle had developed a new whistle on its own, a little lilt at the end like a woman who remembers a childhood song wrong and loves it anyway. The jar on my table with the velvet scale in it had cooled. It had sung in the night while I was out and now it decided not to show off. I put my hand on it and it told me the scale had stopped trying to persuade the salt that it was not salt; the salt had, politely, won. I wrote under the table: pockets are rooms; teach coats no; ask benches their names; thank Reina; bread at night in strange places. I added: go to church kitchens, because if he is clever he will do the thing I hate most and convince a parish hall it owes him its late-night grief.

He did. He tried a basement at St. Luke’s with its folded chairs and coffee urns that have boiled and cooled fourteen thousand times and that will do so again until the Second Coming or Thursday, whichever arrives first. He came when the AA group was out and the Boy Scouts were in and there was a window open because someone has always got hot. He came with sugar and a laugh and an offer of a velvet runner for the credenza that a woman named Alice has been guarding for thirty years with the fierceness of people who know what gets lost when you try to pronounce mercy in architectural language. He got as far as the hallway because church basements are the kind of rooms that greet you like an aunt and ask you who your people are. He said his name, not his name, and the hallway remembered the funerals it had held and the cakes it had cooled and the bridesmaids who had taken off their shoes and danced because nobody upstairs could see. It puffed itself up and told him, in the wood, in the tile, in the steel, we are kitchens, and he stopped and smiled at the way you smile when you realize a building has decided you are not the guest it wanted and you leave because you don’t know yet how to be not in control.

I brought him a cookie anyway. Inez had underlined Thursday twice and it felt wrong to ignore her devotion. I found him at the reevaluation on Seventh, sitting like a gentleman in a dentist’s chair that had remembered blood and decided it would like to remember less. The inspector wore a sweater that had been repaired at the elbows by a spouse who wanted him to live forever so she would always have someone to argue with about salt. Kettle answered every question as a question. He smiled at me like we were being reasonable. I put the cookie on the tray and he looked at it like it might have a story under it that he could substitute for the one the inspector was writing down, and then, without hesitation, he gave it to the inspector’s clipboard. The inspector, to his credit, ate it and wrote in the margin in a way that suggested Inez would be pleased later. I did not talk to Kettle there. Sometimes politeness requires a silence in the presence of a man who has discovered a new way to tell you he is not done.

There were holes that day and the next where I could not be. You know this part. It is the part of the story where men like him get their way because they have two hands and you have two hands and the city has two thousand doors and the math embarrasses you until you lie down and pretend you meant to be tired. The bell on Eli’s porch did not ring and that was not an accident; he did not test it, and I thanked him by not coming anyway just to look. The bench in the skyway gossiped to Reina about a man in a blue scarf who sits there at exactly ten after five and empties a name out of his mouth the way you empty a shoe of gravel and goes home without it and then on Saturdays looks around his living room like something is missing and cannot name it and blames his wife. Reina named the bench Nothing To See Here and the bench shame-laughed and sat itself up straighter and asked her to forgive it every hour on the hour for a day.

He tried the conservatory at Como again and the pond was prim. He tried the lobby of the hotel that used to be a train station and the luggage stands rolled out a little to block his path and pretended they had lost a wheel. He tried a thrift store and found more consent than he knew what to do with and was struck quiet for a minute by a woman who tried on a dress over her jeans and let herself look tired in the mirror and then looked brave and bought it, and he had to step away because even men who build pockets cannot always bear watching women buy themselves back in public. He went to Summit and knocked on a door with copper in its bones and the house remembered Marigold and told him no without moving a muscle. He laughed and went around back and the kitchen door, rude and used to it, shook its head and pretended not to understand his language.

On the third day the winds changed. You can tell when you live where we do. The city’s ears turn a little and the river shifts its shoulder like a sleeper who has been given a better pillow. The sun tried to be honest. I met Dawn for coffee at a place with a stove that talks too much and she did the thing hairdressers do where they fix your head with one finger and no ceremony and you are better without knowing what she did. “He is going to go up,” she said. “Roof. People love the idea of a secret room under the sky. They will forgive it anything if you give them the sense they are alone with the city and it will keep their secrets because weather is less of a gossip than wallpaper.”

There is a roof I like downtown where pigeons have part ownership and sunlight owns the rest. The tar remembers arguments from 1982 that still want a vote. The door to it is labeled with a metal tag that says in capital letters MAINTENANCE and in smaller letters maybe WAIT. I took a key that is a whistle and a knot and told the door my grandmother’s joke about priests and dumplings and it was still funny to the hinge; the hinge remembered a man who used to oil it every Thursday and hummed for him and let me by. The skyline is ours and not ours. It makes hymnal noises when the wind is young. He had put chairs up there, of course. Low, confidences-once-removed chairs, and a little bar with nothing in it yet, because what you first stock a room with is breath. He had run velvet around the short walls so the wind would feel it and forgive it. He had invited people to stand at the parapet and tell the city itself. They had. You could smell the words cooling on the tar like rain.

I took the velvet down. Not dramatically. Velvet is a performer; if you pull too hard it will make it into a scene. I persuaded it that this is a terrible place to be a dress and a worse place to be a wall. I found the nails and told them the difference between holding and clutching and they fell out with dignity. I laid the fabric in one place where the sun would fade it into honesty and said into it, gently, not here. He arrived with his tie undone and his hair corrected by wind and took in the scene with an expression that tried to decide whether to be angry or amused and landed on appreciative because I had bothered to climb.

“You are not tired yet,” he said, and he meant it as admiration, which is also bait.

“I have eaten better coffee,” I said, and I had, because Torvald had given me a thermos that morning that had tasted like the smell of a bakery when the day is still trying to decide to be kind.

We did not fight. We could have, and both been bored. We stood on the roof and watched the river do that laugh where it thinks we are cute. He put his wrapped hand on the parapet and traced the small line of green algae that had a life none of us will ever write a poem about, and he said, very simply, “I was poor.”

“So was I,” I said, and he did not look surprised because he remembers my coat. “Being poor does not entitle you to steal the parts of people that cost them nothing and everything.”

He looked at his hand for once, not at my reflection. “It makes you hungry,” he said.

“Hunger is not a profession,” I said.

He smiled without malice, which is my least favorite of his smiles. “It is a set of gestures,” he said. “And I am very good at them.”

I put my palm on the parapet and told the roof the word my grandmother used for fire that was proud of itself after salvage. Enough. The roof, because roofs love to turn weather into a choice, tilted just enough for him to feel the error of expansion in his knees. He widened his stance, not in panic, in practice, and I put my hand on the velvet and it felt like a cat that has decided to go home with the person who feeds it, and I said to it again, not here, and it agreed because even fabric likes a breeze and a view but not at the price of being blamed when someone falls.

On the way down the maintenance stairs smelled like hands. I touched the walls and they told me names of men who kept them painted: Joe, Sam, a nickname for a woman who doesn’t name herself for strangers and is better at ladders than most. The door let me out with reluctance because I had complimented its screws. On the street Lucy walked past with a bag of groceries and a face like a person who has had to be brave for two days and is now going to let herself have bread. She told me, without preface, “I put the bitter in a weed-killer bottle and I hate myself,” and I told her, “I will take you for pancakes on Saturday and not ask you questions,” and she nodded in the way people nod when they have decided to let you be kind to them later and are penciling it into their calendar next to grading.

At Eli’s, the bell rang once at noon because the wind had an idea and then reconsidered. The boy showed me a new tag on a stone—Library Fine—because he is a genius at theology. His mother had left a note with the casserole pan that said bring it back dirty if it helps, and I almost wept in a way that would have offended the pan so I didn’t. Torvald lean-laughed when I told him and sliced a loaf in a way that made you think of the sound a pew makes when everyone sits at once. Dawn mailed me a photograph of a man’s haircut and a mirror that did not approve. Inez sent an email with no punctuation that said all caps, “INSPECTION PASSED BUT NOT LIKE HE WANTED,” and attached a smile in the form of a spreadsheet.

He tried a thing that would have been funny if it were not so elegant: he turned off the whisper in the skyway for an hour. He asked the glass to be only glass. It did, and it was a relief and it was unnerving. People walked and heard only their feet and the conversation of elevators. They discovered that the silence had been seasoning them. Some were grateful. Some were bereft. He watched, like a scientist with a notebook who cannot speak to his subjects or he will ruin the data, and he discovered that the city does not require his pockets to tell the truth, it can tell it alone when it has to. He hates that. He likes to be needed. He tries to be indispensable. The way to hurt a man like that is to survive without him and make it look good.

I did a rude thing the next morning and invited people to my underplace. Not everyone. Not a mob. This city is too small for mobs unless we are marching. I asked Lucy and she brought an empty jar and a pencil for writing guilt. I asked Reina and she brought the mop, because she says it has to see other people. I asked Torvald and he brought bread that had a hole in the middle like a story he wanted filled in; we are the filling. I asked Dawn and she came with her scissors politely asleep. We ate stale donuts and good bread and told no truths to each other at all, only stories about the places we loved to sit when we were children and where we put our hands when we were talking to someone we didn’t trust yet. Then we taught each other the whistle again, because names change and so do notes, and we promised aloud to give kitchens back their work whenever possible. It wasn’t a meeting. I do not do meetings. It was a room being a room.

He came all the same. Not to us. He is not that kind of brave. He went to a lobby at an office where the marble has a vanity and a stupid kindness, and he leaned under the security desk and kissed the underside in a way that told it it was part of something bigger and he needed it to behave. He tried to get the building to believe it was a pocket and that to be a pocket is aspirational. The building, having been revised a dozen times by men with suits and ideas who did not wash their own cups, considered it. It wavered. Buildings do. We forget that they are not moral; they are curious. I went there and I did not bring a bell, because sometimes a bell is too theatrical. I put my hand under the desk and said, in the tone my grandmother used for children who were five minutes from sleep and had decided to invent crimes to stay awake, later. The desk fell in love with the word later and lectured the entire lobby about it all afternoon by squeaking exactly when someone tried to take themselves too seriously. Later saved the room.

You want me to tell you that we beat him and he admitted it and went out in the snow and took off his tie and threw it in the river and let the river take his part of the story and we clapped and the city clapped with us. I cannot do it. He is a man which means he is a little boy convinced he will be better at grown-up than his father and he is a thief which means he will never reconcile himself to how easy it is to ask permission and be given it and he is ours which means he knows every hallway’s maiden name. He will try again. He will write my name on a napkin and fold it in a way that makes me nervous and put it in a pocket I have not sewn shut yet. He will call himself a host and he will get men who should know better to agree. He will find a new seam. We will teach that seam to be gentle with skin. We will make bells and bitter and bread into a chain he cannot eat through all at once. We will get tired. We will sleep on couches. Beds will forgive us eventually.

I put my ear to the city that night the way I put it to pipes. I asked it, softly, where its pockets really are when it is alone and feels like knowing. It told me three: church basements, true; kitchens, obvious; bus stops, which surprised me until it didn’t, because a place where you wait with people who are not in your life and you stand under a kind of roof and trust a timetable is a pocket if I have ever seen one. He will go to the bus stops next. He will offer them cushions. He will offer them heat bought with honesty. He will ask them to give him a little of that beautiful waiting. I wrote under my table: teach shelters to hum. I wrote: ask drivers what their doors say. I wrote: put bells in the benches and pretend the screws have always had holes for that. I wrote: bring Torvald and Dawn and Reina hot coffee in paper cups that know how to keep a secret.

The jar with the velvet scale sang again at three in the morning. Not loud. Not for show. A soft, almost-ashamed hum. It meant: there is a new fabric moving through town. Not velvet. Thicker. Cheaper. A feral upholstery that men buy when they intend to pretend their chairs will last forever and their parties will always be invited to by people whose names show up in the paper for winning instead of in the blotter for being messy at two a.m. I will have to learn that fabric the way you learn a neighbor’s dog’s bark. I will have to make friends with staplers and staple removers, both, because there is always a man with a little gun who thinks shooting metal into wood is godly and there is always a woman with a flat fork who goes behind him and fixes the angle so no one gets hurt on her watch.

In the morning the wind ran its hand through the city and the city pretended to mind and then leaned into it. I took the long way to a bus stop on Randolph where men with lunch coolers say the word afternoon like a blessing and the pole has a poster for a play somebody’s niece is in. The bench had been told a pocket-story and had been practicing. It hid a bell badly, like a child hides behind a sheer curtain and believes itself invisible. I smiled at it, very obvious, very kind. I rang the bell for it, not to call anyone, just to let the bench hear what it sounds like when it refuses to swallow. It liked the sound. It made the sound.
