The road ran straight out of Milton and into fields that were always a little wet, a little late, grass high around the fenceposts and dotted with the white flags of dandelions when the summer turned lazy. On that stretch in the mornings, Marko slowed his cruiser not because the law said so but because the fog from the river rose in old beds and hung low, as if the town were a sleeping thing breathing through so many missing teeth. The radio spat static like a cat; the dispatchers had a way of chewing words, maybe because their first cigarettes were lit before the sun, maybe because you only needed half a sentence to understand a where and a why in Milton.

He liked the way the town folded in on itself. The way the highway peeled off and left you with Main, then Main became a crooked handful of alleys and then those alleys dribbled down to the mill race in a gray-brown fizz. He knew the names of the kids who hopped the fence to cut class and float on inner tubes, and he knew who among the shopkeepers noticed a hand linger too long by the register. The badge didn’t change his stride, just made it something you could hear through a screen door: boots on wood, voice soft and a little low. Sheriff, sherif, depending on who carved it in their memory. He didn’t correct folks. People had the right to their own spellings of you.

Across from his yellow clapboard house—timbered in a century that believed in square corners and thick joists and a porch that rose like a proclamation—was the single-story rental where the neighbor moved in on an April that smelled of old snow thawing. She had a faded red hatchback full of boxes labelled in tight black print (books, papers, kitchen), and one of those little palm-of-your-hand radios in her pocket, music leaking like something you’re not supposed to hear but do anyway. She wore a navy sweatshirt flecked white with paint and a silver ring on a chain around her neck that clinked when she bent. The first time Marko saw her face it came up from behind a cardboard flap, hair in a knot, eyes a kind of thoughtful hazel. She looked like a teacher who could make a class hush without wanting to, and then let them laugh because she forgot they were supposed to be quiet.

“Need a hand?” he asked, stepping off his porch. He was holding a mug because the morning was old enough for coffee and young enough for breathing in your mouth. He didn’t look at the badge because he hated the way it reflected squirmy light into people’s eyes.

“I need a dolly,” she said, then smiled, and then the smile took the sting out, as if she’d meant it in another language where need and want were the same. “I’m Leah. Vale, like the valley you forget until you run into it.”

“Marko,” he said. “Like the game.”

“Marco?” She cocked her head, half teasing, as if they were already in a pool.

“Marko with a k.”

“Marko-with-a-k,” she said formally, and they shook hands, both laughing before their fingers had quite met.

He found the dolly under the broken lawn mower he swore he’d fix. They got into a rhythm: he carried the things that had corners, Leah the soft corners of pillow and sweater, the ridiculous bag of potholders that seemed to pour out and multiply the way socks disappear when you’re not looking. At one point a green ceramic bowl, the kind you don’t buy but inherit, wobbled in his hands and he caught it against his chest. Her mouth rounded in a little o, the sound of a thank you and a please at once. “My grandmother,” she said, touching the rim. “We ate oranges out of this.”

He could feel himself storing such facts the way he stored license plates, the names of Lorraine’s boys, the color of Mr. Petrovic’s boat. Oranges. Grandmother. The bowl green like the inside of a bottle.

By the time the sun had shucked the mist off the field, her living room had a couch and a lamp and the boxes that said books and papers were stacked near the window. The street was quiet but not empty; Mrs. Reyes across the way had her azaleas pruned into a hedge like a punctuation mark and pretended not to notice the newcomer while noticing everything. A dog barked twice, stopped, decided against the rest of the sentence.

“You a teacher?” he asked. It was the sweatshirt talking, and the neat labels, the ring on a chain.

“Used to be,” she said, and looked out the window for a second as if the used-to-be was walking down the sidewalk and she was waiting to see where it turned. “Worked at a school in Carson. Then a clinic. Now I suppose I’m between. My sister lives up in Fairmont. I’ve been meaning to be closer.”

“And meaning gets you as far as it gets you,” he said before he could stop it, and she glanced back at him, a small interest lifting the corner of her mouth. People had the right to their own spellings of what they were doing here, too.

“You’re a sheriff,” she said, making it not a question, as if the badge were an afterthought like dust on a sleeve. “Working nights? Is that why you’re moving furniture with me at eight a.m.?”

“Days this week. Nights next. We take turns. Milton mostly turns at the same time everyday, so you learn when to be around for it.”

She nodded, folded a blanket, smoothed it twice, an absent kindness. Her hands were quick, clean. He wanted to say something else—something that made her stay in this room a minute more—but he couldn’t find a hook for the saying. Outside, a crow made one loud cough of a call, stepped sideways along the telephone wire, judged them both and then flew off, as if disgusted by their indecision.

“Coffee?” he offered, lifting the mug he had forgotten he still held.

She pressed her lips together in a yes and a no, then gave in. “If you’ve got enough.”

He had more than enough. He always brewed too much and poured the rest into a Thermos he never took with him. On his porch the wood was warm. They sat with their mugs and listened to a delivery truck breathe in front of the Captain’s Catch—Milton’s idea of fresh fish was a weekly truck from downriver and a chalkboard that read cod, halibut, shrimp, no salmon today. Leah tucked one leg under herself and watched a bee worry itself against the glass of her window before finding the gap and slipping free.

“You don’t sound like you’re from here,” he said. She didn’t sound like anywhere, really. That careful, almost deliberate way of shaping words as if they might try to get away if you didn’t.

“We moved around,” she said. “Army kid. My father’s medals lived in a cigar box. My mother’s plants lived in coffee cans and died in every kitchen. I learned where to buy bread in a new town before I learned where to sleep. Maybe that’s why I like boxes. They keep things honest.”

“And Milton keeps them.” He gestured with his chin down Main Street. “Keeps, or keeps you. Most people who go don’t come back. The ones who stay don’t want to admit that staying was easier than leaving.”

“And you?” She turned, eyeing him over the edge of the mug. That ring on its chain tapped once at the ceramic.

“I like knowing where the edges are. You throw a rock in the river, you know where it’ll be in a mile. You talk to someone on Tuesday, you know what they’ll tell you on Friday. It’s a kind of kindness.”

“Hm,” Leah said. The sound was neither agreement nor argument, only something like interest to be returned to later. “Kindness can exile people, too.”

He didn’t have a right answer for that, so he didn’t try. They let the bee find its own way back.

When he had to go he left a note on her counter with his number—three numbers really; the department, his cell, the landline that was technically his mother’s. He didn’t write Sheriff next to the numbers. He didn’t sign it at all. As he pulled the cruiser away, he caught Leah standing near the window, palm pressed to the glass, as if she were testing whether the day was warm enough to open and let in.

The next weeks were a tapestry loosely woven. He saw Leah at odd hours: kneeling in her thin strip of garden with a trowel and a look of radical concentration, returning from the mailbox with smudges of ink on her thumb, holding the green bowl in the crook of one arm like a small planet when she took out the trash. He learned she drank tea in the evening and ate cereal standing up by the sink. She learned he let the dispatch radio ride shotgun in his house for an hour after he got off work, like a guest he couldn’t bear to ask to leave. They kept talking, in increments, as if the town itself were a stern aunt doling out conversation in approved doses.

One afternoon she found him under his porch fiddling with the mower. Her hair was down for once, a rope more than a thread, and it made her seem a stranger who had wandered into the precise house where Leah had just been. “I hate engines,” she said without hello. “They sound angry. Even when they behave.”

“You and me both,” he said, then pulled the starter and listened to the cough and grind. The mower thought about it, decided to be contrary, coughed again.

She sat on the end of the steps and bent, wrapping her arms around her knees. She was close enough that he could smell her—something plain like soap and something citrus that might have been the ghost of that green bowl. “I used to date a man who could take a carburetor apart with his eyes closed,” she said. “He did once, blindfolded, to prove a point. He cheated, though. He had his friend whisper the steps, like stage directions.”

“What was the point?”

“That he was too clever to be kind. I was slow figuring it out. Cleverness can pass for kindness if you squint.”

“You’re hard on cleverness,” he said.

“I teach,” she said, as if that were answer enough, and then added, “taught.”

He worked the choke, cussed under his breath, felt the catch and then the run, a rough spew of cut grass and joy. She clapped softly like a memory of applauding children. The sound went into him somewhere he didn’t know held sound.

“Come to the dinner at the firehouse tomorrow,” he said, surprising himself. The invitation rose like steam from something we do without consent. “Pancakes and sausages and a raffle for the new hoses. You can bring that green bowl and join the community in its syrup.”

“Do I need to sign a form?” she asked, the corner of her mouth tipping, and then she said yes. Later he would hold the yes up to the window and see, in the angle of light, how a yes can lean toward what it wants.

At the firehouse she walked as if she were crossing water. People noticed her, because she was new, and because Leah had a quality you didn’t see until she was standing in line in front of you and then you couldn’t stop seeing it. The bowl, empty, rode in her hands like a cup of rain. He watched her exchange words with Mrs. Reyes (I like your azaleas. Thank you, dear. They were my late husband’s favorite), with the McCourt brothers whose idea of conversation was to nod in the order of their ages, and with Eddie from the gas station whose jokes about gasoline were so bad they traveled through and came out good on the other side. He didn’t hover, but he orbited. He filled her coffee, more than once. He introduced her to Deputy Thomason, who was always a little bewildered, as if the world had recently been introduced to him, rather than the other way around.

Later, after the raffle, after the raffle’s bribed victories, after Leah had lost and didn’t seem to care, he took her outside and pointed at the scar on the water tower that wasn’t a scar until he told her the story. A spring night, five years ago, kids with spray paint clattering like bones and a weather vane that had tried to throw them and didn’t. “They painted a heart and then, in it, their initials. Then they painted over their own names, like they were practicing leaving,” he said.

“And you caught them?” Leah asked.

“I did. There’s catching,” he added, “and then there’s how you hold the caught thing.”

She looked at him. The light from the firehouse threw far and fell short in odd places, so that her eyes were dark and her hair lit like a creek. “How do you hold something you catch, Sheriff?”

“As if it might break,” he said. He didn’t add but as if it might hurt you if you do not. He didn’t add all the other things that crowded the words. Sometimes you say one thing because the rest won’t fit in the mouth you have.

Summer slid like a coin at the bottom of a pool that looked shallow until you reached for it. Word of Leah—Who’s the new girl in the little house? What’s her story then?—went the way word goes through Milton. It rounded corners and put on a hat and pretended to be casual until it had collected enough detail to be called truth. She was good at the farmers’ market, where the man with the apples insisted on giving her a bruised one for free if she bought a perfect one, and where little children tried to sell her things from their pockets: a button, a gray pebble, a yellow twist-tie. She was the kind of person who said yes to being handed an object without value. Marko loved her for it. He didn’t tell her so. He took his love like a ticket and folded it small.

He told himself he wasn’t one to fall. He had dated—that safe word, to date, like a calendar that turns and moves on. He had let a woman named Paula sit on his porch with her bare feet tucked under her and listened to her talk about driving down to Florida because if you didn’t go now, when would you go, then he’d never heard from her again. He had held a woman named Becca while she cried about the past and the past had settled heavy on both of them, as pasts will, and they had parted like people who have picked up something they don’t want to name. But with Leah he felt a steady interest that didn’t flare or burn off. Something like a seed that keeps being seed and then one morning is green at the tips. He waited and did not name his waiting.

Something in him liked the restraint. Something in him hated it.

He drove the county line and answered the calls. A cow got out on Carson Road, slow and stunned and stubborn; he made calls in his slow, patient voice until three people who could handle a cow arrived and handled it. A teen got into an argument with his mother’s boyfriend and broke two plates; Marko let the boy rage in the driveway until the rage turned into tears, then told the boyfriend how to be silent for thirty minutes without being cocky about it. He wrote a ticket for a man who always drove ten miles over and always apologized in a tone that suggested apology was his hobby. He was not exceptional. He was steady. He liked this about himself until he didn’t.

On an evening in early September, the clouds hung low and the air pressed like a hand on the back of a neck—thunder-season. Leah stood on her porch and looked up at the weather as if it were something she could bargain with. “I used to be sick every fall,” she said when he came over with his hands in his pockets, like a man walking into a room where he expects to be welcomed and yet is always surprised when he is. “When I was little. They called it the back-to-school flu, though I never missed school. I had perfect attendance like a superstition. I collected those little certificates in a folder. My mother saved them. After she died I threw them out and then went back and took them out of the bucket and dried them on the radiator and kept them again. Someone should have stopped me.”

“You had perfect attendance,” he said. He was smiling. He didn’t understand how the ache in the story balanced on the odd lightness of the joke.

She shrugged, embarrassed at the silliness of caring. “It’s stupid, isn’t it? In the end, who did I show up for? A certificate and a school that forgot my name a week after we moved.”

“People show up for themselves,” he said. “It can look like showing up for everything else. But it’s the first thing.”

She breathed out, a small sound. The first fat drops of rain hit the porch; one spattered their feet like ink. He felt the tug—the wish. Reach out, the body said. Just a touch stood between them and something. But in the thunderlight he saw something in the set of her jaw, a kind of bracedness. He didn’t know if it was for him or for herself. He eased back half a step.

Two days later Leah coughed five times in a row and laughed at herself for having counted. Later that night she messaged him—just the simple words of neighborhood now—Do you have ginger? Tea? He carried both across the street, wrapped in a towel because the kettle had shocked him with its small ferocity, and Leah met him in her doorway with a knit hat pulled low and the eyes of someone who was trying to be funny about how they felt.

“It’s nothing,” she said, hoarse. “I know everyone says that. But really. Just a tickle.”

“Isn’t that what they always say in detective shows,” he said, “right before it’s something?”

“Do you watch detective shows?” She lifted an eyebrow, the ring tapping the cup.

“No,” he said. “Only for the obvious jokes.”

She let him in and they sat in the cave of her living room, curtains drawn not for privacy but because the day outside glared. She dozed against her blanket and woke to throw out old campaigns of Kleenex, apologizing as if he were grading her. He stood on the threshold of the kitchen and listened for the alert from his phone. The town didn’t stop needing to be held because a neighbor had a fever. He resolved a quibble over a baseball field by phone because he could, and because the voices—grown men—were on the edge of laughing if someone gave them permission. Then Leah’s forehead burned his palm and he said, “Tomorrow the clinic,” and she said, “It’s just,” and he said, “Still,” and in the little tug-of-war of the adverbs he won.

The clinic was packed because an old warehouse in the next county had had a leak and people had breathed what they shouldn’t breathe and panic, like rat poison, had traveled by rumor. Leah sat with her hat pulled low again. A child across from her coughed a cough he was proud of. She looked at Marko and wrinkled her nose with a kind of rueful humor. “Perfect attendance,” she murmured. “Look at me now.”

He wanted to put his arm around her, simple as that. He didn’t because the clinic was a public place and because it felt like a spell to be broken if not careful. The nurse called her name—Vale, Leah—and he walked her to the door because he could, because in such small ways we stitch the fabric of the day, and the nurse glanced at him and then away with the practiced blandness of someone who’s seen the shape of care and of care cut clean with other things.

When she came out she had that blank expression people get when they’ve been told to take something seriously in a way that doesn’t feel like seriousness. “A flu,” she said, and made a face, as if the word itself were too small for the way she shook. “It’s going around. The nurse said rest, fluids. She said if this were a movie I’d be the hero who gets the plague and touches everyone and turns the town into a fable. She has a sense of humor I didn’t expect.”

“They need it,” he said. He didn’t add, so do I. The lightning stitched the sky in long, lazy lines that felt half commitment, half pretense. Some storms were mostly a rumor that made the trees posture.

In the middle of the night he heard his phone and woke like a fish pulled toward the surface. It wasn’t his work. It was Leah, two words: help, please. He didn’t put on his boots. He didn’t put on his jacket. He ran. The rain had stopped but everything shivered, dripping. The door was not locked. She sat on the kitchen floor with her back against the cabinet, eyes closed, face a pale wax. “Can’t catch,” she said when her eyes opened—breath, the missing word. He knelt and counted in the way they had been taught, not soldiers but not civilians either, you can train a body to some kinds of readiness; he held her hand and rode out the wave of her breath with her until breathing remembered itself.

The ambulance came soft and slow up the street, lights to slash but no siren. He rode in front because he was in a uniform or because Milton made space where it could. He turned and looked at her through the square cut from the patient space to the cab. Leah smiled at him, faint, that stubborn lightness of hers making a small joke of the oxygen tube. She tilted her head as if to say sorry. She pointed at his socked feet and made a face and he laughed, helpless. It felt wrong to laugh and wronger not to.

The hospital was a county one, cheerful against itself, walls painted the color of lemonade. The nurse with the humor was there, or her sister humor wearing another face, and she took Leah into a room with a bed that made the sound of air being rearranged. There were forms. There were questions with boxes. There was a chair that implied it would be acceptable to sleep there if one were desperate or foolish. Marko filled a box that asked for emergency contacts and put his number in a space he didn’t know if he had a right to occupy. He was not family; the word family held so many locked drawers. He thought, briefly, of his mother, of the afternoons he had sat in rooms like this and watched her watch the ceiling as if the ceiling were saying something she had to learn quick. He wanted to make a phone call. He wanted to not make a phone call.

Leah was gentle with the nurses even when she was not gentle with herself. She answered patience with patience. They fitted her with fluids and monitors and said the word observation as if it were soothing—a word that means we don’t know but we have chairs. When he was allowed to sit with her she held his hand and said, “I don’t like being looked at,” which made him laugh, which made her cough, which made him wince.

“Then close your eyes,” he said softly.

“They’re closed,” she said, and they were, but he saw the quick movement behind the lids, as if she were reading or dreaming quickly, turning pages in that thought-book she seemed to carry everywhere.

The next day, the hospital began to name her in its own way. Leah became the lady in 2B who apologized when the monitor blipped too loud. She became the one with the ring on a chain. She became the woman who said no to pudding and yes to ice chips and asked if the nursery down the hall played music at night because she would like to hear someone else sleeping nearby. The nurse with the humor was named Tamika—there, now he knew it, and it changed everything. She said, “You’ve got a visitor, Miss Leah,” and a gentle sarcasm slid under the words: a visitor, as if they were playing in the grown-up world pretend game.

It was a man in a track jacket with a faded high school emblem, bright sneakers, hair shaved close to the skull that made him look younger from behind. “Jesse,” Leah said. “I know you from the clinic,” and he grinned the grin of a person who recognizes a place where they have held a name more than once. He had a sister in 3A who had been there long enough to learn all the nurses’ coffee orders and then forget them. He had a laugh that was a little too loud and he turned it down when Leah flinched. “I brought contraband,” he whispered, showing the corner of a crossword puzzle book peeking out of his pocket as if it were a sin to know words.

Then there was Mrs. Bowen, seventy-nine and stern, who walked the hall with an IV pole like a partner at a square dance. She made Leah change the channel because she refused to watch people scream at each other on television. “They scream at each other because they don’t know they have small voices, not because they like the sound,” she told Leah, and Leah nodded and then told the nurse later that she had been scolded and found it surprisingly comforting.

Marko watched Leah gather these people the way she gathered buttons and pebbles, as if the brokenness of what brought them together—fever, lungs that needed a gentle hand, time that had started to disobey—were not the only story. He liked Jesse’s laugh; he liked Mrs. Bowen’s iron; he liked the girl doing her rounds with a yellow volunteer shirt and wide eyes and the way Leah made her relax in thirty seconds with a compliment about her earrings. She made a small world out of the hospital; he hovered at the edge of it, a man in a doorway who wanted to belong.

He visited between calls. He set the chair so it wouldn’t squeak when he shifted, learned to read the monitor and also learned to pretend not to be reading it. He took phone calls in the hall, with his voice pitched to this place, a tone he reserved for sudden delicacy. He watched a mother in slippers weep into a Styrofoam cup and then clap a hand over her mouth as if grief were spilling out of her, daring to be seen. In the bathroom over the sink a sign instructed one to wash as if one had touched something one could not forgive oneself for having touched. The phrase stuck in him like a burr. He washed. He watched his face in the mirror look older and then younger the way faces do when they are tired enough to be mistaken for someone else’s face.

There was a morning he came in high with a good mood—no emergencies overnight, a dawn that made Milton look like something no one had ruined yet—and Leah was already awake, reading and making marks in the margins of a paperback that had seen better days. “You annotate?” he said, half-teasing, because it seemed like such a Leah thing to do, to leave small trails for herself to follow later back into a thought.

“It helps me argue with myself,” she said, then reached for his free hand with her free hand and squeezed it. “I’m glad you’re here.”

It was nothing and it was everything. He leaned too far into the chair and it made the sound it made, and they both laughed at him, the chair and the woman.

In the hall, he met Jesse. “She’s getting better,” Jesse said, as if he were feeding Marko a thing Marko might mistake for bread or stone depending on the angle. “She’s getting better,” he said again, and the repetition was a form of prayer, which Marko did not correct because what would he correct in it.

“She’s making friends,” Marko said, a half-mirth in the words that flipped and showed its underside: worry.

“She does that,” Jesse said simply. “Some people walk through a room and it rejects them. She walks and the room expands.”

He liked the man and he didn’t. He liked the way Jesse’s hands looked as if they had learned to hold heavy things a long time ago and still remembered how. He liked the way Jesse looked at Leah without flinching at the color the fever had left on her cheeks. He didn’t like the way the word friend sat in his own mouth, half-sour; he wanted another word that he didn’t yet have the right to pronounce.

At night, he went home and sat on his porch and listened to the river not being where he could see it. He watched the square of Leah’s window across the street stay dark because she wasn’t inside it. The green bowl sat on her counter like a moon in another sky. He remembered the firefighter dinner and the raffle and the water tower’s ruined heart, and how he had said as if it might break, and how it kept turning to mean something he hadn’t intended but couldn’t now disown.

When Tamika told him there were restrictions—“We’re closing visiting to immediate family for a few days; the flu is chewing through us and I can’t have a parade out there”—he nodded as if this were only an administrative decision and not a door closing on a small world he had been learning to belong to. He told himself he was a grown man. He told himself there were many kinds of patience and this was one. He went to work and was impeccable with his handwriting on forms because that was something he could make perfect in a day that was not perfect.

Leah texted when she could. It’s full of stories here, she wrote once. He wrote back, You’re one, and then deleted the words and replaced them with, Bet. Another time she wrote, Tamika’s joke today: “I’ll give you ice chips if you give me a crossword clue,” and he wrote, What’s nine letters for mean what you say, and she sent back a heart that was more square than heart and he watched it blink on his screen as if it knew the shape didn’t matter.

And then, because town life keeps pouring through, there was a small thing that wasn’t small. A man called in a domestic and Marko went because he had to. He stood in a kitchen that smelled like oil and the last fight and he spoke in the voice that had made boys stop throwing rocks at the trains. He separated people without making them feel exiled from what they had said they wanted. He took a woman’s statement. He took a man’s empty mouth—no words left for him and none that could be given. He thought of Leah in her hospital bed—the way she opened a space around her; the way illness had made her still and made the world move toward her. He looked at the man and felt a flash of contempt he tamped down hard. Nobody is only the worst thing you did, he wanted to say, but he didn’t trust his throat to make it sound like belief.

He washed his hands longer that night, under the sign’s instructive voice, and saw how the day had written itself in small notations across his knuckles: a smear of grease from the porch’s failing railing, a pencil line. The kind of story no one reads. He slept at the kitchen table for an hour. He woke with his cheek stamped.

It didn’t get better quickly. Flu is a word that hides. It’s like saying rain when you mean a hurricane. It is old and ordinary and also terrifying in the way that small things are terrifying when they slip their leash. Leah’s fever made numbers he didn’t like; then the numbers calmed. She had a roommate for a day, a woman who hummed show tunes in her sleep and made a fan out of a magazine and fanned Leah when Tamika was out on a break. She made Jesse help her set up an illegal game of gin rummy and then forgot the rules on purpose so the game never ended and frustration never found a foothold. Mrs. Bowen told a story about the war that turned out to be about her first husband being wrong about the weather and never saying so.

At some point Leah gained a small cough that meant she could breathe more deeply. At some point she took off the knit hat and her hair, which had been the last banner of her stubbornness, lay flat against the pillow and made her look younger than her stories would suggest. At some point Marko stood in the doorway and wasn’t allowed in and he understood this wasn’t about him, and yet it was about him in the way all small humiliations are, and he felt angry at the hospital and then ashamed of that anger, and then angry at his shame.

He sat in his cruiser outside and watched the lit windows like a child watches his mother at the sink; not because she is doing something riveting but because she is there. He told himself it would pass, and the absurd thing was that he was right. Days are mechanical in their passing; they do it whether we beg or not. For a few of those days, he saw Leah in the company of others more than he saw her in his own company, and he learned something about what it entails to love someone whose kindness does not turn its face only to you.

Her messages shifted—new names in them. Jesse’s sister said the doctor looked like someone out of a soap opera, how can one trust that jawline. Mrs. Bowen and Tamika were in a feud about the television channel again; the junior volunteer confided she had taken a syringe home in her pocket by accident and cried when she realized and then smuggled it back like a spy. Leah laughed in the texts; he could hear it, even without sound. Once she wrote, I am being fought over because I exhale too loud. This must be how queens feel. He wrote, You’re a tyrant, and she wrote back, Shh, someone will hear.

He thought of taking time off. He did not. There was a festival out by the fairgrounds, and the deputy who was always new at whatever he was doing needed help with the man who walked around with pockets full of nails and an explanation that had holes in it. He visited a school to show his badge to children and let them tug at the metal. He spoke to a man who believed the government had put him in a box and kept sending him envelopes, and he said, We’ll get you out, though he couldn’t get himself out of the chair by Leah’s bed. He came home and ate food standing, like Leah did, and thought he was borrowing her strength but found himself in borrowed exhaustion instead.

The night before they planning to release her—observations made, numbers charted, breath returned like a guest who had taken the long road—he pressed his face to his hands in the dark kitchen and found it wet. He hadn’t known he was crying. The sound of himself annoyed him; this too he forgave and did not. He thought of his mother again: she would put her hand on the back of his head when he was small and had fallen and hold it there, not moving, not shushing him, a kind of hand that recognized that crying had a length to it and you could not abbreviate without consequence. Leah would go home. He would carry her bag; he would fill her green bowl with oranges and not say what he was doing. They would return to their porches and their evening tea. He could see the picture. It looked like a postcard of a place that existed and did not.

It was early when he went to the hospital, earlier than visiting hours in the new strict sense, but he knew the back way Tamika had jokingly taught him on a day when the rules were gentler. He carried a small book he had found in a thrift shop—a book of essays about lakes and mountains that made him think of air as something you could hold like a map. He had left a sticky note in it, a beginning of a thought to show her. He had shaved too close and the air bit his cheeks.

In the stairwell he heard someone singing. It wasn’t a hymn or a pop song, just the kind of tune that falls out of a mouth when the mouth is tired and the heart wants something to do. He followed it without meaning to. It was the janitor, a man with white hair and eyes like gray water, a man who pushed his mop like it had gravity built into it. “Morning,” Marko said, because you should say morning if you want to be allowed into it. The man nodded, sung the last two notes and let them hang.

Marko turned toward the room—Leah’s room the last two weeks, as if a room belongs to a person if they sleep in it long enough—and then stopped, because he heard laughter. Leah’s. Jesse’s. Tamika’s. Mrs. Bowen clucking like a chicken. It was a chorus. It wasn’t something you interrupt. He stood in the hall looking at a poster that told you how to wash a teddy bear in the hospital laundry and let the laughter wind down. He practiced his face, the not-smile that hides a real smile because real things sometimes scare people when they are expecting less.

Someone opened the door. Jesse. He smiled the easy smile that had made Marko dislike him briefly, before he decided that disliking a smile was cowardice. “You’re early,” Jesse said. Not unkindly. A little warning in it, though; the way men warn each other without wanting to admit they are being territorial on behalf of people who would find it absurd.

“Had a quiet morning,” Marko said. “Thought I’d bring her a book.”

“It’s a good morning,” Jesse said, stepping aside. “She’s going home. She’s been drawing family trees for all of us on a napkin.”

He went in. Leah looked small in the bed, smaller than a week ago, and stronger for it. Her hair was clean and lying obedient. The ring on its chain was a little to the left; how it had slid he didn’t know. She held the napkin, indeed a tree on it, with scribbles—Mrs. Bowen’s cats listed under offspring; Tamika labeled Matriarch; Jesse’s sister drawn as a long branch with lights. Leah looked up and saw him and her face did a new thing, something like what a hand does when it has been holding something for a long time and then lets go. Relief. That was the word. It slid into him with the first green of trees. He breathed.

“You brought me a lake,” she said, holding the book, reading the cover. “How did you know?”

“I don’t,” he said. “I guessed.”

“You guessed well,” she said. “You do that.”

“Sometimes,” he said, and they did not glance at the times he didn’t.

He helped her dress, that funny solemn ritual where you pretend not to see the intimacy and pretend to be useful, both pretenses nearly true. Tamika had packaged her discharge like a present with a ribbon of instructions. Mrs. Bowen patted her on the forearm as if testing it for something a patient needs that is not vitamins. Jesse fetched the green bowl from the bag Marko had brought because Leah had insisted the bowl go with her if nothing else did. They moved down the hall—a parade, familiar now to itself.

Outside, the air was a taste you can’t name unless you were raised where seasons show off more than they need to. Marko opened the passenger door of his cruiser anyway—badge got him that much—and Leah sat with care, as if she were sitting on a story she didn’t want to spill. She closed her eyes when the wheels started to move. “It smells like rain,” she said, and he wanted to tell her about the water tower and the heart again, as if repeating the story would make it true in some new way.

He helped her into her house, across a threshold that was the same and different, and set her bag down. The afternoon came in through the windows like a dog surprised to be let back in. Leah stood in the middle of the room, hands out unnecessarily to balance herself, silly, and he touched her elbow and moved her a little to the left, as if this were a dance they had done before and forgotten how. The green bowl sat in the center of the table. He put oranges in it without comment. She watched him do it, said nothing, then said everything, softly. “Stay a while,” she said. “If you can. If you want.”

He stayed. They drank tea. He told her something about a cow, and she told him something about Mrs. Bowen’s husband learning, at eighty, to mail letters. They were so careful with each other they nearly dropped what they were being careful with. The phone rang twice. He didn’t answer. The third time he did, reflex, and when he told dispatch he was off-duty for the hour the dispatcher made a sound like a blessing; maybe they could hear in his voice the particular level at which he had booked himself for the afternoon.

When he left, he stood on her porch one breath longer than usual. Leah touched the doorframe as if it could sign something for her. “I’m glad,” she said.

“Me, too,” he said. He had wanted to say I love—no, not that. Not yet. Or, maybe yet, maybe long before that. He kept standing a second longer and then made himself move.

Across the street, on his porch, the cup he had left that morning had a dead moth in it, a small pale boat on tea. He set it aside and sat in his chair and looked at the sky that had the color of paper a child has drawn on and erased and drawn on again. He folded his hands. He counted three breaths. He felt the world steady under him like a deck. Then he looked at her window and saw, because it was Milton and because he had trained his eyes to it, the flicker of a presence—someone else moving in the small downstairs room, someone carrying an object that looked like a book. He thought, Jesse. He thought, of course. He did not move. He did not feel the blow of it, not yet. He sat still and practiced the way he would walk across the street and be welcome anyway.

He rehearsed. He rewrote. In his mind he heard the sound of his own voice on that other day, on that sky-electric night. As if it might break. He held himself to his own half-made promises, not knowing what else to do. And the last of the warm air went thin, then cool, then cold, like breath leaving a room you don’t realize until your hands feel far away from your wrists.By night, the field behind his house made a sound like paper being turned, the dry blades rubbing and whispering. Marko sat with his elbows on his knees and let the dark fold the porch into fewer and fewer edges. The flicker in Leah’s window resolved itself into shapes that made sense and didn’t; an arm, a shoulder, the bend and straighten that meant someone was sorting papers or books. He thought he saw the crown of Jesse’s shaved head when he tilted to lift something. He pictured the bowl because he could not help himself, and whether it led the image or only accompanied it, the thought of oranges followed like a dog that learned its name on the first day. He did not cross the street. He let the cricket chorus make a fence. In his pocket the phone lay like a coin he would not spend because to spend it would mean admitting what you had wanted to buy.

He went to work in the way that has nothing noble in it and yet saves lives: he showed up, he checked the gasoline in the cruiser, he listened to his deputies make brief reports in the steady tone that made everything sound as if it could be managed if they only had the right-sized hands. The town did its due diligence of ordinary trouble. Someone shoplifted three cans of soup and a pair of nail clippers and cried when the clerk touched her arm at the door because she had meant to be better than that today and couldn’t bring it off. A man burned brush without a permit and then stood with the hose like a farmer feeding a snake from the faucet and told Marko he’d sworn to himself he would stop being the kind of man who broke small rules and here he was, watering his own foolishness. A high school girl sat on the steps by the post office and looked at her phone and tried not to look at her phone, every muscle in her body a diagram of waiting, and when Marko asked if she was all right, she said, “I’m making myself not text him back,” and he said, “It’s the hardest work there is,” and it was enough to make her laugh, which saved her ten minutes of self-torment and perhaps a bad decision.

A deer ran across Carson Road in the late afternoon the way wild things do, with a suddenness that is only sudden to the human brain. The pickup clipped it and spun it into the ditch, where it lay with its whole body suddenly condensed to the flare and flare of breath. Marko knelt in the brittle weeds and lay his palm on the animal’s neck, near the ear. Its eye, huge and glass with panic, stared at the part of the sky he had no access to. He spoke aloud because the voice does something even when the words are not theirs. “You’re all right,” he said, which was a lie, and then, “I’m here,” which was not. He did what he had to do, quickly, the way you snap a rope so it doesn’t hurt the hand it is attached to. He stood afterward and listened to the world take the shape back that the deer’s body had pressed from it. Old Petrovic, whose boat he knew the color of without looking, pulled his pickup off the shoulder and got out with the careful gait of a man whose knees had begun to write their own laws. “Hard work,” Petrovic said, not meaning the bullet or the weight of the deer at the end of it, but meaning the gentleness that precedes and follows. Marko nodded. On other days, in other fields, he had thought of his father, and how the man had taught him to take fish from the line as if he were waiting for the fish to agree. He thought now of Leah breathing into his palm, that night in the kitchen with the tile cold against his knees. He thought of the way she had said help, please, the two words wearing all possible meanings and still coming to him in the simplest way.

At home, he slept in his mother’s old room because the mattress in his own made a sound at a certain shift and had begun to annoy him in the small way that an unpatched hole in a shirt sleeve does. The rose wallpaper in his mother’s room had faded to a color that wasn’t in any catalog anymore; when the sun came through in the morning the flowers looked like they were pretending to be forgotten. He dreamed that he was fishing and that the fish were all silver rings, glinting and spinning on the line, and when he woke he had the odd brief conviction that he had swallowed something beautiful and would spend the day looking for it with his tongue.

Leah texted him after nine, as if she were waiting to be sure that nine meant morning and not night to whoever she was texting. A clear day, it read. Feels like I’ve borrowed it from someone else and should give it back unwrinkled. He smiled, because you cannot ask people to show themselves and then scold them for how much of themselves — their habit of metaphor, their courteous worry, their way of making even a cough a phrase — they hand you. He wrote back, Your landlord accepts returns with minor creases, and she sent a picture of the bowl with sun in it, the green glazed into a light that made it look like water from a country with different rules.

He went over after lunch because he had told himself honesty was a habit he could practice in hourly increments. Jesse was there, yes, sitting on the floor with a screwdriver and a lopsided bookcase that leaned as if it were listening to Leah. The man looked up. For a flicker’s half-heartbeat there was a startlement — the animal flash of borders being tested — and then Jesse’s face settled into its easy geometry again. “Morning, Sheriff,” he said, and Marko said, “Afternoon,” and they both smiled in the way men smile when they are measuring something they will later call respect.

Leah sat cross-legged with a box of paperbacks, evaluating each as if she were inviting it to sit in a row with its cousins and did not want to play favorites. The sweatshirt was clean and unpainted and her hair was pulled back with a ribbon that was probably a piece of string. She looked better and she looked precarious in the way bridges look when you first walk across them after a flood. “I’m arbitrating a dispute,” she announced. “Elie Wiesel refuses to be adjacent to the gardening manuals. He says they make him feel frivolous.”

“Put him next to the field guide to birds,” Marko said. “Let him have wings to look at while he does the work.”

Jesse snorted a laugh, not unkind. “And the detective novels? Do they get to sit by the poetry or are we afraid they’ll pick up bad habits?”

“They already have bad habits,” Leah said. “That’s why we like them.”

They arranged the shelves, the three of them, and by the time the slanted bookcase had been persuaded into an imitation of uprightness, the afternoon had bent toward that hour when the day shows you its scaffolding. Leah moved slow when she stood; she tried to hide the slowness as one hides a limp. Jesse noticed and handed her a glass of water without fuss. Marko noticed and handed her the chair with arms because he had seen too many people stand up and then not know what to do with their own hands. The small social calculus did its work without a sum being spoken aloud.

“Thank you,” Leah said at one point, and it might have been to the chair or the men or the bookcase or the afternoon. Her voice had more air in it; he liked the way it had learned to let air through again.

He found himself looking at the ring on its chain. It sat like a punctuation mark against her collarbone; what it punctuated he did not know. He had not asked. He had never asked. He did not know whether not asking was courtesy or cowardice. The world insisted on its distances. You can shout across a river and sometimes the echo you hear is only your own voice returning in costume.

After, they ate cold chicken on napkins. Jesse told a story about the clinic that was really a story about a man who couldn’t explain his pain without making frying-pan sounds with his mouth, and Leah laughed and said that sometimes words fail and you have to let your body try the sounds that come before language. Marko listened and learned the beat of the other man’s breath. He noticed that when Leah touched Jesse’s arm to get his attention she did it in the way one does when one knows what an arm is like when it has been asked to carry what was too much for it and did anyway. He noticed that when she touched his arm she did it differently, a lighter touch, a checking touch, as if he were a note she wanted to be sure she had played in the right key. He filed these facts away without knowing what he would do with them, in the place in his mind where he stored license plates and who owed Mr. Petrovic beer.

Milton spun on. The library said it was hosting a fundraiser and then the fundraiser was suddenly a day with tables and pies and a quilt that would be raffled but never won by the person who bought the most tickets, because Milton believed in a moral universe that punished obvious yearnings. The hallway beside the old card catalog smelled like floor wax and cinnamon. Leah put on a yellow volunteer sticker and sat at a table with the timid girl from the hospital whose earrings Leah had praised and whom Leah greeted as if they had worked side by side for years. “I’m Lila,” the girl said, blushing as if she were confessing something, and Leah wrote Lila on her own palm with a ballpoint as if the ink could anchor the day in place.

Marko stopped by in his uniform because the uniform had a way of making certain small doors open without anyone admitting there were doors. Mrs. Reyes had baked a pie with a lattice so precise it could have been a map of a gridded city. A boy with a cowlick sold bookmarks with quotes on them handwritten in all caps — HOPE IS A THING WITH FEATHERS, which made Marko picture a chicken wearing sunglasses. Leah stood up when he came to her table and didn’t sway, which made him unreasonably proud. He hovered, then bought three bookmarks and a slice of peach pie and was dispatched by the librarian to carry four stacks of donated National Geographics to the sorting room because he had arms.

He ferried paper relics and learned, from the limp of the old man who carried the other side of the box, the years in which the man had believed the world could be captured in glossy frames. “Do you remember when they photographed that Afghan girl?” the old man said with sudden fierceness. “I carried her face in my wallet for a week and then I felt like a thief and took it out.” Marko nodded because he did remember, and because he recognized that look of having held something too tightly and then letting go and not knowing what to do with the hand afterward.

Jesse arrived at the library and did not come straight to them. He conferred with the woman running the used-book table near the mystery section and then disappeared into the little room where they kept the donated clothing for the shelter. Leah looked toward the door and then back at Marko, an unreadable flicker across her face that made him understand that she had learned to practice neutrality long before this summer and this town. “He’ll come say hello,” she said, and then, hearing herself, made a face at her own tidy prediction. “Or he won’t. Either way the world goes on.”

“And we sell pie,” Marko said.

“And we sell pie,” she agreed.

In the middle of the afternoon someone ran in with the tight, high voice Milton gave you when the river spoke too loudly. A kid had gone off down by the mill race and not come back when called. It had been a game until the game had more rules than anyone remembered authorizing. Marko was turning before the woman finished the sentence. He didn’t make himself seem important by running; he made himself useful by moving. Leah’s hand found his sleeve and squeezed once, the way we bless people with our hands when we don’t trust our mouths to fit all the words in. “Be safe,” she said, and the words — a woman’s smallest prayer to a man who is going into the part of the day you can’t predict — landed in him and took their place next to the other simple sentences that stitch a life.

He drove the back road, the one he always took when the mill’s old foundations threw shadows onto the water like a grid. The air was a hard bright. The trees, halfway to letting go of themselves, clung to their leaves with a late guilt and then shook once, as if to say they were not done being trees. The path down to the race was slick with the day’s drips and the last month’s sediment; he had been walking it since he was a boy with skinny knees and a crush on the idea of disappearing into the green. The mother stood on the bank making a sound that was two syllables long and contained the child’s name and all the years of the child’s life. The boy’s friend pointed toward the culvert and then away from it, uncertain of the narrative that would look better afterward.

“Jacob,” Marko said, his voice tuned to sit on the surface of water without breaking it. “Hey, Jacob. It’s Marko-with-a-k.” He said it because Leah had named him that, and because a joke new to a child could be a rope to grab.

He listened with his skin more than his ears. There was the sound of the water doing what water does, and the sound, under it, of breath where breath didn’t belong. He went down expectant of the cold that always comes as a shock no matter how many times you pitch yourself into it. He felt the knot pull and then ease, and then there was a pant, a splash, the ungainly triumph of a small person being wrested from a large element. He held the boy against him and counted without moving his lips, the way you have to do if you want to be more useful than heroic. The child shuddered and barked like a seal and then cried the cry that comes after rescue: the one that tells you there will be a later to consider what happened.

They wrapped the boy and scolded in the good way and promised things they could not promise, like no more rivers for a week. Somebody had brought a thermos of hot chocolate, because Milton always had at least one person prepared to treat a crisis as an excuse for sugar. Jesse appeared at some point with a pile of dry sweatshirts, two sizes too big for everyone, because he had gone into the donated clothing room and emptied a drawer into his arms and thought, this will be needed somewhere. He pulled a hoodie over the boy’s head and drew the strings as if he were pulling a curtain against something that had no right to see.

“Thank you,” the mother said, to everyone and no one: a general benediction. She knelt and put her forehead to her son’s hair and breathed in the smell of river and boy and winter coming and let the whole body of oxygen in her say grace. Marko stood off to the side and let his own breath return to its natural work. He wanted to look at Leah across the library’s crowded aisle because that is what you want after you do something that has more than one word named in it — brave, stupid, inevitable — you want to find the person who will hold your gaze steady for a second and not make you explain yourself. But Leah was not here. She was perhaps selling a pie to a child who had stopped crying, or teaching Lila how to make change for a twenty without apologizing for taking too long, or sitting for a second with her head in her hands to make the room stop pitching because her lungs and the adrenaline had made a pact without consulting her.

He drove back up the little hill to the library with Jesse’s wet sweatshirt steaming on the passenger seat. They shared the small grin that men share when they have each made themselves useful and are embarrassed by the desire to be seen while doing it. Inside, the noise was what happens when relief bustles its relief around the room, collecting itself in the rustle of coats and the scrape of chairs. Leah looked at him from the table and stood; she took in the water on his jeans and the way his hair had been rearranged by river logic and, without making it a performance, she gave him back his steadiness. It was not like in the movies; it was not a kiss or a run across the room. It was the thing where one person makes the other person feel like the room has stopped turning quite so fast. He had not known until that moment that he had been turning.

“That mother will make him pancakes for dinner,” she said, as if reading a ray of the future off the puddle he made on the floor.

“The good kind,” he said. “With the edges crisp.”

“And a lecture,” she said, not unkind. She put her hand to her chest and rubbed the place under the ring as if something there ached sympathetically. “Are you okay?”

“I am,” he said. “And you?”

She smiled, the small tired smile of a woman whose exhaustion was honest, and said, “I have never been so happy to sell such an ugly paperweight,” which made him bark a laugh and scared Lila into putting three dollars into the donation jar because she thought that was what people did when adults laughed too loudly.

October unrolled itself in browns and golds and then, suddenly, a gray that meant the color had to be found elsewhere. Leah learned to pace her errands. She would walk down to the Captain’s Catch and buy a dozen eggs even though the Captain’s Catch had no business selling eggs, and she would stop twice and pretend she had meant to look at something — a flier, a painted rock in someone’s planter — because she was making peace with slowness and slowness did not want to be seen as a concession. Marko, who had never been patient with his own body if only because his body had never given him a reason to practice patience, learned a version of waiting that did not feel like waiting. He learned the hour she napped and the three hours she was most likely to answer texts and the day of the week when she felt brave enough to answer the phone. At work, he found himself kinder to the man who always drove ten over. He let the apology hobbyist talk longer before he wrote the ticket because sometimes the talking is the point, not the ticket or the going ten over.

One evening Leah’s sister came down from Fairmont with a casserole so sturdy it could have been used to shore up a sinking porch. Nina had the same hazel eyes but they were not thoughtful; they were appraising. She had the particular tightness in her jaw of a woman who has pledged to herself not to cry about her family in public and who keeps losing arguments with her own tear ducts in grocery aisles. Marko met her on Leah’s porch and knew, in the way one knows where the potholes are on a road you’ve driven forever, that this woman had already decided who he was and was busy revising that decision in increments. She thanked him for the night of the ambulance with a nod that was halfway to a salute and then asked two brisk questions about his schedule that let him see how she arranged people around her sister like furniture in a room with a draft.

“Nina is my general,” Leah said later, fond and exasperated in an old-sister way. “She tells me when to dig in and when to retreat. She has always had a map and I have always had a poem and we have learned to pass the paper back and forth without tearing it.”

Nina eyed the green bowl with curiosity she did not bother to disguise. “You brought oranges,” she said to Marko, as if they had to catalog the contributions of every man who crossed the porch.

“I did,” he answered, and was glad he had not brought a thing that could be read in any complicated way. The ring on Leah’s chain glinted once, an alert in the lamplight, and Nina’s eyes ticked toward it and then away with a look that made him think: she knows, or she thinks she knows, and either way the story will have to be told again.

That night, after Nina had gone and the casserole had proved itself against hunger and skepticism both, Leah held the ring in her fingers the way one holds a coin between between thumb and forefinger before deciding what to put on which side. She did not lift it from the chain. She rubbed the silver with the pad of her thumb until the surface warmed. “I will tell you about this,” she said finally, not asking for permission in the way a person sometimes asks without asking by waiting to see if you will stop them. “But not tonight.” He nodded, and the not tonight was not a dismissal; it was an invitation to a future with furniture. He thought of the way he had told the water tower story twice and the second telling had made it a promise instead of a confession. People had the right to their own timing of you.

The first frost came in thin white writing on the roofs. The river looked like a sheet hung out to dry and forgotten until someone in the house went to bed and remembered it and came outside in their socks swearing gently at their own mind. Leah put pine cones in the green bowl because oranges offended the eye in that light. She and Marko took to walking a block together when it was light enough, and when it wasn’t they sat in their separate windows and texted about the same square of black. He asked if she was warm and she said yes, and then added, “I always lie about being warm,” which made him stand and fetch her a blanket even though she could not feel the version of him that did that across the street.

At the Thanksgiving drive, the sheriff’s department handed out turkeys and forms and looked the other way when someone took two. Marko watched a man he’d arrested twice and warned a dozen times take a bird with solemnity and put it into the back seat beside his son and then stand and put his hand flat on the roof of his car for a second, as if he were blessing it for getting them where they needed to go. He thought, sometimes we are all this man, standing beside the bad decisions we own like a car we are still paying off and blessing it anyway for being what it is and not worse. He loaded two birds into Leah’s hatchback because she had signed up to deliver meals on the west side. “You sure?” he asked, using the question to cover the fact that he had already mentally plotted the route with the fewest hills. She said, “We are not delicate because we are sick,” and then ducked her chin because Nina’s voice came out when she got fierce and she always felt she had to apologize afterward.

On the second delivery a boy opened the door and said his mother was asleep and could they set the turkey down there on the little table with the missing leg and not tell anyone. Leah went in with the soft command of a woman who has taught children to find pencil boxes and their own names in the same five minutes before a bell. She wrote a note and taped it to the fridge with the cartoon magnet that said I OWE, I OWE, SO OFF TO WORK I GO in a font that tried to be merry. Marko adjusted the table with one calf to keep the bird from sliding and saw the collection of bills under the sugar jar. He didn’t touch them. He looked away and looked back by not looking, the way you do when you know a thing only subsists by not making a spectacle of itself.

They stepped back into the cold and stood looking at their breath like two people trying to figure out who had just spoken. Leah looked tired and in charge. “I forget,” she said, and then corrected herself: “No, I remember too clearly and then I forget I have remembered.” He didn’t ask her what exactly she meant because the exactness would come when it came. He walked at her pace back to the car and put his hand flat on the roof, briefly, because he had seen the use of it that afternoon and because it made the car, soulless thing, feel included in the effort.

Days shortened. Nights did what they always do in small towns in winter: they asked you if you had enough of what you said you needed and then watched to see if you lied. Marko’s mother’s house grew creaks he had never cataloged before. He oiled the door that led to the basement because at two a.m. it sounded like a girl laughing and he could not be having that. He called his mother once and then twice at the assisted living place where she allowed people to serve her tea and allowed them to think they were the ones deciding when it came. She asked him if he was eating and he said yes, and she said, “With another person in the room?” which was her way of saying, do not become the kind of man who thinks his own company is always enough.

He took to carrying a thermos finally because Leah had laughed at him for brewing and not drinking. “What is the point of that?” she had said, stroking the metal sides as if it were an animal she might adopt and name. “Make a habit of the thing that sustains you.” He did and found himself liking the way the thermos felt heavy in his hand in the dawn, a weight that said the day’s first choice had been made before the noises had even started.

On a Tuesday he stopped by Leah’s to return a book she had pressed on him — a slim volume with a blue cover about a man who walked several countries slowly and learned that there is nothing to be learned from walking that could not be learned by standing still except the standing still comes with a different kind of blister. He found her on the floor among maps. She had torn the county into pieces from the free welcome center brochure and was laying them out with a frown. “I’m trying to make it more honest,” she said. “They make the curves of the river too smooth on these things. It lies and then you get your feet wet.”

He knelt and took a scrap and rotated it and offered it, let it be refused, rotated again and made it fit, not because he knew but because he understood the desire to make a town tell the truth. They talked about the town the way you talk about a person you love who has not asked you for your opinion. He told her where he had first kissed someone and where someone had first kissed him and how those were different places; she put a pine cone on both spots as if to mark them for an expedition later. He told her where he had crashed his bike and had a scar and she told him where she had opened a door that she should not have opened and found something that she carried around for a year and then put down without noticing she had put it down, the way one day you stop checking the stove three times and don’t remember the day you stopped.

He asked about the ring without meaning to. It came out like breath turning into a word because sometimes we breathe and there is sound. “Who?” he said, and she knew what he was asking because the chain made a little sound against her just then like a coin against a plate.

“My father’s,” she said, and then, seeing his surprise, which he tried to hide and failed, she nodded. “It’s not romantic. Or it is, but not in that way. He wore it when he didn’t wear his wedding band, which is to say, when he was trying to remember himself. It is not a story that flatters anyone. He said it kept his hands from making fists, which was a lie, but not a full lie. When he died, my mother gave it to me because she did not want to wear it and she did not want to throw it away, and because she believed I would know when to keep it and when to take it off and set it on the table and say: not today.” She touched it, the chain pulling at the nape of her neck, and let her fingers rest. “There it is. You can file it with oranges.”

He breathed, which was what he had to offer. “Thank you,” he said, and the words did not feel ridiculous, because gratitude for true things never does. She looked at him with relief that he had not made it into the wrong kind of drama, and he loved her for that, which was not the first time and not the last and not a thing he said.

In December, the water tower got a new coat of paint. Not because anyone settled on a story about the heart and the initials and their erasure, but because rust has more authority than romance in budget meetings. Marko stood in the lot behind the firehouse and watched a man in a harness make his way up and felt the peculiar vertigo that comes of seeing a man you have never met not fall. Leah came and stood beside him without speaking and then spoke anyway because it is hard to be silent about everything. “I think often about the way you said that,” she said, without naming the thing, and he nodded, without naming it either, and they stood for a minute in the town that was theirs only insofar as they had chosen it, which is the only way towns are ever yours.

When he crossed the street later, Jesse was already on Leah’s porch, his hands jammed into his pockets, his head tipped back to look at a plane dragging a thread across the sky. He moved aside to let Marko pass, and for a second the two men occupied the same square of wood as if they were learning choreography. “We’re taking her to the tree lighting,” Jesse said. “You coming?” It was not a challenge. It was a question made of two other things: I will not cut you out, and I am asking you to be as adult as you have said you are.

“I am,” Marko said. He sent a text to dispatch, the honest kind, the kind that made his own day better: On Main for the tree. Call me if you need me. The response came with a smile implied in the rhythm of the taps: We always do.

They walked slow because Leah walked slow. They stood in the square with a hundred other people who had learned to pretend awe at a string of lights being made to behave. They counted down, because counting down makes an event where there would otherwise be only a switch and a brightness. Leah’s breath made small clouds. Jesse cupped his hands around his mouth and hooted when the lights popped, and then looked embarrassed and shrugged, and the shrug saved them all from having to discuss how big feelings make noise. Marko clapped. He felt a hand — Leah’s — curl briefly around his wrist inside his coat sleeve, a touch not visible to anyone not invited to notice. He let it be what it was. He let it not be more than that tonight. He breathed in pine and diesel and the particular sweetness of cheap hot chocolate. If there is a way to write down the precise width of contentment you can live with without asking for the next inch, he did not know it; he only knew that there were nights when he could be taught.

Later, when the square had thinned and the tree stood doing its job without witnesses, they walked home in their triangular pattern, not taking anyone’s arm but not pretending they would walk if one of them fell behind. At Leah’s door, she stopped and turned and looked at them both with the gravity she reserved for the end of certain conversations that she would later call beginnings. “I am not a prize,” she said, and they both flinched and then nodded, because of course, and because saying it aloud made it less likely that anyone would drift into the cheaper version of themselves that thinks prizes exist. “I am a person,” she said, and then let the humor she could not stop herself from making pull the corner of her mouth up. “But I would not argue with a trophy if someone gave me one for excellent tea.”

“You’d have to give a speech,” Jesse said, his voice relieved to be given a lower stakes to land on.

“I always give a speech,” she said, and they all laughed, and in the laugh some of the winter lifted and showed them the ribs under it, and they were not afraid.

The wind came up. The bowl sat empty in the window, waiting for whatever winter used for fruit. He had oranges in a bag, and he had the good sense to leave them for morning, and he had the better sense to know that good sense would not always be what he needed. He went home and took off his badge and set it on the table and put his hand flat on the wood and felt it be steady under him. He thought of rivers inside their banks and of hearts painted out and of a father’s ring that knew when to be worn and when to be set down. He thought of Leah’s hand around his wrist, precise as a light switch, and of Jesse looking up at a plane and inviting him to belong to his own decency. He slept. In the morning, the frost on the grass wrote its little brief letter and disappeared before he could read it twice, and he decided that was a good order for some messages: seen, admired, allowed to melt, not hoarded, not framed.Winter settled into Milton the way an old quilt gets pulled up in the night and you wake already under it, surprised at how it holds heat in the places you had forgotten needed holding. The frost on the grass wrote its backyard hieroglyphs again and again until even the maples gave up trying to read them, and then one morning the world went tight and glazed and even the telephone wires looked like someone had piped sugar along them in a fit of domestic excess. Marko learned the new creaks of steps and the fresh complaint of porch boards that had never before been asked to take on that much glass of air. The river made a different sound, hiss and whisper under its own skin, and his patrol took on a domestic route: checking on the houses he knew would have wood stacked, checking on the houses that would pretend they did, pressing his knuckles to doors not to knock with authority but to test a temperature like a nurse in a room where the patient is asleep. The radio crackled with the special staticky courtesy that comes when everyone is speaking a core of necessary words through scarves and teeth.

The morning the ice storm blew through from the north and then circled like it had forgotten its keys, the town went dark in a way that made the sky seem brighter than it had a right to be. He could see for miles and also not decide what any of it meant. He idled in front of Mrs. Reyes’s hedges and watched the azaleas accept their armor, each leaf carrying its thin shell like a coin. Leah’s house was a square he could count on in the gray, and he could see candles throwing their tolerant light against the window glass. Jesse’s hatchback sat with its trunk open and blankets in the back that had been there since the week at the hospital; the man moved like someone whose hands had already practiced all day and were happy to keep practicing. “Firehouse,” Leah said when he came to the porch, hat rim wet, her voice soft with having been used kindly already, and he nodded because it was the only answer to days like these. The firehouse had a generator, and Milton believed in the kind of civic love that expresses itself in coffee and extension cords.

Inside the big room, there was a smell that made you believe in soup even if you had never learned how to. Tamika was off shift and yet here, her scrubs covered with another layer of something that could get dirty without anyone minding, and she pointed people to the cots and the folding chairs and the table where the old card players had ceded their spot as if they had planned to be generous all along. Leah’s green bowl sat in the middle of a table like a minor sun, filled with clementines that looked absurdly cheerful and necessary at the same time, and children reached for them with hands that had been in mittens too long and then peeled and breathed the sweetness in like a cure. Marko carried in a box of extension cords like a man carrying a basket of snakes and let other people tame the problem into lines and outlets. He could feel the town making itself into a diagram he had seen before: who shows up, who sits, who curses under their breath about the plow that never comes, who suddenly finds themselves in charge of the children by virtue of having a voice that can turn chaos into a game. He moved back and forth between the generator and the closest door, gloves in jacket pocket because hands were better tools when they could feel.

There was a man who didn’t want to come in, a decent man with a good name and a bad back who insisted his house could keep him even if the heat did not, and Leah stood with him under the low eave and let the ice fall beyond them without making both of them part of its theatre. She did not coax him with softness that would make him feel himself diminished in his own eyes; she did not use the language of rescue because she had learned that kindness can sometimes be the hand that pushes, not the hand that lifts. “You can keep your house and still keep yourself,” she said calmly, breath visible and speech measured so he wouldn’t feel hustled by the weather, and then added, with that angle of humor she employed like a level to keep the thing true, “You can come in here for the coffee and then go back out and glare at your windows so they know you’re not taken in by their excuses.” The man’s laugh came reluctantly and then more easily, and he said he could stay an hour to keep an eye on the blowhards at the back table and make sure they didn’t cheat at rummy. When Marko watched him eventually fall asleep in a chair with a blanket over his knees and his stubbornness folded, not broken, he watched Leah across the room collecting paper cups into a neat pyramid and found himself rewiring his certainty about what moves people and what merely pushes them further into the wind.

Paula returned to town the way people do who have left and kept their boxes, as if there was a map they had always maintained for just such an entry and exit. He saw her through the firehouse window first, the tilt of her head the same and not the same, a hat that tried to make a different person out of the old outline. She was at Captain’s Catch when he made his rounds in the afternoon, the chalkboard absurdly confident in its declaration that the supply chain for cod was indifferent to ice. She leaned on the counter and held her elbows as if she had asked herself to be contained for this one exchange. When she saw him, she smiled in recognition and then watched him the way a person watches a photograph of themselves from a year they want back. “Florida was wet,” she said, because you have to say something that sounds particular when you come back from a place that is a noun more than it is a town. He said it seemed like it would be, and she laughed, and they went to the door and stood under the small awning watching the storm think through whether it would continue punishing the town for being this far north. “You look good,” she said, and then rolled her eyes at herself, and added, “No, I don’t mean it like that, I mean you look like someone who sleeps at night sometimes.” He told her about the hospital, about a bowl that fed people oranges when other things felt scarce, about a boy at the mill race and a mother’s hand on a car roof, about the way the plow made a sound through ice like regret. She told him about roads that don’t curve, about sunlight that starts to feel like a dare, about the way you can miss a place you were sure you were never going to. “You coming with me next time?” she asked with the kind of smile that tries not to make the invitation part of a test, and he shook his head and felt how the refusal did not come from a noble place but from the simple weight of the fabric of his days. She nodded like a person who had expected that answer and liked him better for the way it made him stand still in his own life. They hugged in the awkward winter way, about four inches of air between two coats, and he walked back out into the brightness with a relief he did not entirely trust and yet did not argue away.

The library reinvented itself twice before January had worked itself into the bone. They held a coat drive and then realized that what people wanted was not coats but a place to put the ones they took off, so Jesse brought in two-by-fours and built a rack that leaned as much as the bookcase at Leah’s but held up under the weight of denim and camouflage and wool. Then Leah put a sign on the door that read Thursdays, Six to Eight, Words, and people who had lived their whole lives not admitting what they could not read came in with the honesty people reserve for winter, because winter has a way of stripping the day down to its necessary tools. Lila sat beside Leah with a stack of notebooks and wrote her own name at the top of the first page of every one like a spell that would not be broken if the letters repeated themselves enough times. A man who had worked at the mill thirty years and never learned the way sound lays down on paper set his pen to his granddaughter’s name and made it look like a creek at first and then like a fence and then finally like a word that could be recognized by the girl who would receive the postcard he labored over as if working a field. Marko came and sat in the back without his badge because it seemed rude to bring authority into a room that was building a reliance of a different kind, and he watched Leah’s face change when a woman realized that the bus schedule was no longer a code built to mock her life. He had believed himself to be steady before; he did not realize how much might of his own had gone unused simply because he had never needed to lay it gently against the surface of someone else’s fear.

The overdose call came on a Tuesday that had been uneventful in the way you never trust, the way a good mood walks out of a room backward because it knows it is making you suspicious. He knew the address before dispatch finished the house number because Milton’s troubled places repeat themselves the way a song does when you’ve fallen asleep with it still playing. He was there with Thomason quicker than he believed possible, the young deputy’s face pale with concentration and determination wrapped around it like a bandage. The boy on the floor was old enough to have made decisions and young enough to have all his future printed on the inside of his eyelids. Tamika met them like a runner coming into a relay—she happened to be behind someone else’s steering wheel when the call came and Milton bent rules for people who made the town better—and the dance of hands and plastic and breath began, boring and necessary and terrible. Jesse was on the sidewalk when they came, because of course he would know this boy, because the clinic was a place where stories intersected and left their fingerprints. He stood as far back as he could and still be counted as a witness, his hands dug into his pockets not from the cold but from his wish to rip something out of time and put it down on the road where the road would roll over it and flatten it back to manageable. Later the boy blinked and coughed and said something so ordinary it sounded like a line in a play, and Thomason made a noise that Marko didn’t think the kid knew he had in him. In the cruiser, driving away in a careful grief, Marko called Leah and told her nothing and told her everything by letting his breath be heard at the end of each sentence. “Does it get better?” she asked, and he said, “Sometimes it does,” and then added, because he had learned to try not to make a hallway out of hope and make people walk down it too soon, “It gets different.” She sat with that, and in the silence he could hear the small shift of the chain at her neck, as if even the ring was thinking about how to behave toward days like this.

His mother had begun to misplace names the way you misplace coins—annoyingly, occasionally, and then suddenly in a way that makes you pat all your pockets with a seriousness you have never applied to small metal. She had been misplacing faces for a bit longer, which she did with a gallows humor that belonged to an earlier decade. “I should keep a guest book,” she told him when he came by with Tupperware that pretended to be real food, “and make all these friendly strangers write in it so I can thank them properly.” When Leah came with him one afternoon, bringing a mug with a broken handle that she had glued back on as if glue was a way of telling the world it could be forgiven for letting go, his mother looked up with a professional interest. “So you are the reason my son has been learning to drink hot things without making a grunt like a man twisting off a pickle jar lid,” she said, and Leah laughed and looked at Marko to see if he would blush as he had as a boy, and there it was, the whole circle of it, the way family can make you both older than your life and also five again. They drank tea until his mother declared that tea was good but somebody should take the kettle away from her because she was beginning to suspect it of having too much to say. Leah sat on the edge of the bed and put her hand on the coverlet and kept it there like a person anchoring tablecloth to table, and after they left his mother said, carefully, “You bring me people who look me full in the face. Keep doing that, it helps.” He drove home with the heat too high and his coat undone, letting the hot air and the cold air argue it out around his ears until his shoulders lowered to a reasonable height.

Sometime in January a section of highway outside town turned mean because the temperature couldn’t be bothered to remain constant. It slicked itself over in a way that looked harmless until tires rolled across and declared the chemistry to be otherwise, and Marko was out there with flares and a handful of bad news in his pocket, flagging traffic like a man trying to slow down the hour hand. A minivan lay on its side with a door pushed open and a child’s sock two feet from the place where the snow had failed to cushion the indignity. The father kept saying, “We’re okay, we’re okay,” in the voice of a man conjuring truth with repetition, and when the mother finally cried it was a relief to everyone because the tears made room for the boy to laugh at the brave, ridiculous snowman a volunteer firefighter had made out of shoveled slush. He came home from that one wet through, stung by his own lack of belief and surplus of it both, and found a note on his porch that had been weighted with a pine cone and a thermos leaning against the door. The note said simply soup and a picture of bowls, circles drawn with a generous hand, and he went inside and met the steam with his face and felt a particular tiredness unlatch and a particular steadiness return. It felt like a small religious practice handed down without anyone having to argue about doctrine.

On a morning when the snow got shy and made a thin powder over everything that insisted on not being covered, he parked behind the firehouse and looked up at the new paint on the water tower and saw, because the sun was out for exactly four minutes and the angle was silly and the air was so cold it tried to bite his eyes, the faint suggestion of a heart where the old paint had been scraped and painted again. It was a trick of condensation and memory and determination, and he laughed out loud in a way that would have embarrassed him had anyone he knew been there to witness it. He took a picture with his phone and sent it to Leah with the single word again, and she sent back a string of dots that looked like the trail of someone crossing the field and making their way and then wrote, I like the persistence of bad ideas when they are softened by weather, which made him snort coffee through his nose and salute the ridiculous and the true each in their turn.

It was Leah who asked him if he would drive her down to the bend where the river almost admitted to being beautiful in winter, the way certain people get better looking when they stop trying. She said it over the top of Lila’s head one Thursday, the library still warm from the exhalations of people who had tried and failed and then tried again at forming letters, and he said yes with the unthinking ease of a thing he had already decided before being formally invited. Jesse came to the porch as they were leaving and stood for a second in the doorway with his hands in his pockets and his eyes flicking from Leah’s boots to the sky and back, and then he nodded and said, “Bring her back before she takes up ice skating as a vocation,” and the blessing in it was of the kind men learn when they decide to stay in each other’s company past the first awkward alarm. The road had finally remembered that pavement was supposed to appear between patches of snow, and the trees along the river had the look of people gathered to watch something no one had announced. They sat in the car with the engine idling because it felt wrong to make the cold take up residence inside the cab, and watched the water slide under a lace of ice that had, in places, given up pretending to be complete.

She talked about Montana and a road with no fences where they had once gone on a summer that would not end, and he talked about the night the river had taken a cow and returned the tag two miles down with the number still readable. They passed the thermos back and forth with a generosity that had ceased, with them, to require stage directions. “When I was little,” Leah said, her breath making a small storm in the narrow space between her and the windshield, “I believed the river had moods and if you could learn them you could ask for things and get them. Now I think it simply has a body and it obeys its body the way we do as we age, with a kind of rueful honor.” He looked at her and then away because the look had too much heat in it for the air they were refusing to share with the outside, and he said that he had believed the road had moods and had learned them by buying tires at the wrong time and watching the men at the shop confer as if they were priests. They laughed and then sat quiet. The quiet was not the absence of talk so much as a ribbon laid down next to it.

He touched her hand and did not take it, which he had done before without making a ceremony of it, and she turned her palm up and let him make his hand into a lid for a jar of something sweet that ought to be saved and also ought to be eaten soon. When he kissed her, he did it with his eyes open not out of suspicion but out of a desire to bear witness, and her mouth—mint from the tea, human, not coy—met his with the gentleness of someone who has given speeches and has finally decided to say the line that kept knocking at the back of the throat. There was no orchestra, not even their heater hummed particularly dramatically, and still the engine of the day shifted a gear so smooth he almost didn’t feel it. They sat back and she made a face that was humor and nerves and delight folded into one visible opinion, and she said, “I am not promising you anything except to be fully present for what we say we’re doing when we say it,” and he said, “I would not know what to do with a promise that looked like a road map anyway,” and they laughed because literal maps were on her floor at home and literal roads were pretending to be benign under their wheels. When they drove back, they listened to the radio make a song into static and then back into a song, and he saw how the town sat on its winter afternoon like a cat on a radiator—sudent, cautious, pleased, pretending none of it was even happening.

Night came sooner for a while and then, nearly imperceptibly, began to delay itself by a handful of minutes each week like a child you have to call inside fewer times. Marko kept his thermos and his habit of leaving his badge on the table so it could listen to the house go quiet around it, and he kept the new muscle of reaching into his pocket and finding his phone and sending a message that wasn’t about a call or a problem but about a light on a certain porch that had failed and then rallied. Leah kept her chain and her ring and her energy in its new careful scaffolding, and kept also a small fleet of practices that looked like nothing and held the day together—the way she folded a dish towel over the back of a chair as if to make a place for a tired person to sit, the way she set a book aside with a finger in it and looked up when someone spoke, the way she said no to three invitations a week and yes to one without making either refusal or agreement a performance. Milton kept being Milton which is to say it kept trying to live within its banks and made a mess when it could not and then invited everyone to the firehouse with its extension cords and its generator and its oranges. When he lay down at night, Marko listened to the river the way you listen for a person in the next room to turn over and settle, and he let the sound convince him that steadiness is not a moral category so much as a weather pattern, and that learning to predict it is less the point than deciding to walk out into whatever it is with your hat on and your eyes open.The thaw did not arrive like a polite guest. It came at the edges and grew arrogant by noon, softening the ditches first until they thought well of themselves and then letting the river find its shoulders again with a satisfaction that was not personal and felt like it anyway. The ice went out in white rafts that smacked themselves flat against the abutments under the old bridge and then slipped away bearing twigs and, once, absurdly, a child’s purple mitten that had survived a season by keeping quiet about whose it had been. Marko walked the low streets after dawn in boots that had not forgiven the winter and counted the kinds of mud by feel; there was the mud that warned you two steps ahead with a squelch and the mud that told you only afterward with a tug at the heel like regret. The radio found its special worried tone that meant the weather was an accomplice. He sent Thomason to the west side with sandbags in the bed of the county truck and told him not to be stingy because this was one of those days when generosity could be counted and the number seemed to help. The town had already found its buckets and its opinions and was leaning over its own banks to talk to itself about what to do.

By midmorning the library basement smelled like all basements the week after a rain and the week before a problem. Leah stood at the top of the stairs, hair pulled into a rope, pointing not so much with her finger as with a line of intent that made even the state map on the wall pay attention. She had drawn a list on a yellow legal pad and was adding, subtracting, drawing little boxes beside each item that stalled progress until checked. “We’re moving the paper,” she said to Lila, and then to Marko, “and the coats and anything that will pretend to float and then won’t. I don’t have the heart to watch the shoebox photos do that thing where the ink lifts and makes faces into ghosts.” Her breath still had a winter’s care inside it and he watched her refrain from taking the box that looked heavier than she was admitting. Jesse came through the front doors with two men from the clinic who were used to moving bodies that had let themselves grow stubborn; they moved furniture as if it said their names aloud when they touched it. The librarian stood behind the desk with a stamp in her hand like a wand and stamped RETURNED on a stack of paper she had no intention of charging late fees for, and then put the stamp down with a small, decisive sound that suggested she had remembered herself in the face of water.

The county sent a man who looked like a man sent by the county—clipboard, cap, car that thought four-wheel drive excused many sins. He consulted a map and then looked up at the river as if the river would adjust its behavior to suit the grid, and when Marko spoke to him politely but with the exactness that meant this was not the first time he had done this dance, the man nodded in increments, made a phone call in which he sounded more uncertain than his cap allowed, and stepped aside enough to stop being a problem. Tamika, who had somehow acquired a whistle on a lanyard without anyone seeing who had handed it to her, corralled the kids into a corner of the firehouse with markers and twenty-five rules of a game she invented out of breath and patience. Nina called from Fairmont after lunch with a list of which roads were closing and which would pretend not to; she had the particular clipped relief of a person whose job is to look at maps and whose sister is living on one. “I can come down,” she said, and Leah said no in a tone that reminded both of them of the years when the older one had done the driving and the younger one had sat in the passenger seat reading aloud the way the voice we love makes billboards intelligent.

“Dock Street will go first,” Marko told Thomason when the deputy checked back in, leaving his boots on the mat and dripping in the threshold out of habit learned by being told once by the librarian and deciding he could comply gracefully with some laws. “After that the one house with the blue plastic playground. Don’t argue with Mr. Vedder if he insists he can build himself a Hoover Dam out of lawn chairs. Just tell him I said to come to the firehouse and save his breath for telling me how the county is wrong. It’ll give him a sense of purpose.” Thomason grinned and then sobered and said he had a family on Belmont who didn’t want to leave because their dog didn’t understand cots, and Marko wrote the name on his palm with a pen because he had run out of paper in his pocket for the day’s promises. He forgot to wash it off that night and found it there in the morning and laughed, because sometimes you need your own hand to tell you what to do.

In the mid-afternoon the kind of sound trees make when they surrender a branch came from the cottonwood by the mill race and followed it into the water with a crackers-and-plate crash. The branch snagged on a piling for a moment and then swung free like someone letting go of a quarrel late and dramatically. People who had been watching from behind fences exhaled in a chorus that rose without rehearsing. A woman in a sweatshirt that said GO LIONS DESPITE EVERYTHING crossed herself and then looked around to see if anyone had seen her make that small treaty with something ineffable. Jesse stood with a roll of trash bags under his arm and called to a boy on a bike, voice mild, the kind of mild that heads off later sorrow, and the kid pretended the message hadn’t been specifically for him but turned anyway because the math on certain days is simply: don’t be stupid near fast water.

Leah’s house sat just high enough that the gutters worried without making threats. She had lined her windowsills with towels in a way that made the old clapboard seem like someone was tucking it in. On Marko’s porch, the wood darkened and then lifted in a grain he only saw in spring; he pressed his fingers to the railing as if to feel the house register the weather. He had told himself he would not hover but the day lent itself to hovering; whenever he found himself useless he drove the next block and found usefulness again. He sent the high school boy who always hovered near trouble in the direction of the Captain’s Catch to ask Emilio to boil a vat of pasta because in an hour hunger would besiege the firehouse in the foolish way it always did after a fright had been ridden out, and the boy saluted with mock solemnity because a mission made him taller.

When the lights flickered for the second time and then thought better of it, Milton said a small unison prayer with its throat cleared and its voice deliberately secular. Marko walked his circuits of the firehouse like a man checking on stoves before bed and in his checking found Paula folding blankets in a corner and making a list on an envelope because she had arrived with that old slightly wicked smile and found someone to hand her a job without their having to discuss history. She looked up at him with a kindness that had no leftover sparring in it and said, “This is why I came back sometimes,” and he nodded because he knew; there is a way a town lets you be the person you hoped you could be when there is actual work to do. They moved around each other like people who had once danced and now were friends waiting to clean up after.

Leah ferried mugs with their handles all pointing the same way because it kept hands from fumbling and in a lull stood with her palm on the green bowl, fingertips resting against the glassy dip inside the rim like someone checking if a dream belonged to her. Lila hung a sign that read KIDS’ TABLE although kids of all sizes gravitated there because the crayons were all broken into the good size and because there was a pile of paper that asked nothing of you except that you draw the house you could picture when you closed your eyes. Mrs. Bowen appeared as if from the hatch in the ceiling and set up a card table and simply by setting it up made order pour itself into the room in two shy streams. Tamika blew her whistle exactly twice and then hung it around the neck of a girl who needed to know what it felt like to be the person other people looked at when something had to be done.

The river signed its name on the bottom step outside the Captain’s Catch and then stopped, not because it was moved by pleas but because something on a hill far away decided to delay melting. The water stood there like a cow in a doorway refusing to be led and Marko knew from the shape of it that they had until night and then till morning and then it would make a new decision. He sent people home slowly. The man with the dog on Belmont let the dog into the back of his truck and the dog agreed because he had already decided he would follow the boy anywhere this year. Emilio delivered pasta in foil pans that might once have held carburetors; he frowned at anyone who tried to pay him and said, “Eat,” like a blessing he kept a stock of behind the counter. The librarian allowed a temporary amnesty on fines and watched with gratification as this news, more than the flood itself, made people teary in a way they would later find ridiculous and thus remember with fondness.

That night, when the firehouse grew the particular hush of a place that has earned its sleep and the generator’s hum moved from insistence to presence, Marko found Leah asleep in a folding chair with her knees pointed into the aisle. He wanted to ease her into a position that would not punish her ribs and did not because waking someone into the kind of day they had just been holding seemed like an offense. He arranged someone else’s coat under her head and set the green bowl on the edge of the table within her reach like a talisman she would register before she registered the room, and he sat on the floor three feet away and let the day pass over him a second time. In the morning he woke with a crease on his cheek from the seam of the mat and a sore shoulder that he accepted the way you accept a note left on your windshield—annoying, instructive, not the worst thing that could happen. Leah woke with a line across her forearm from the chair and smiled as if the mark delighted her, like a stamp from a venue she was proud to say she had been let into.

The river, as if bored with its own performative rage, sank back with a sigh that only some people heard. People stepped into their yards and did the little accounting that comes with water. One man held up a photograph like a trophy, keeping his thumb off the corner as if that would unwrinkle it; another swept the same square of porch ten times, each pass collecting more grit and memory. Over at the mill race there was a new snag of branches that made a sculpture inadvertently modern; someone would remove it eventually, but for now the town admired the way the sticks looked like an argument and let it stand as a decoration.

Marko went to see his mother in a morning light that had the moral superiority of sunlight after hardship. She wore a sweater of a blue too bright to be an accident and had entered the mood that made the aides both grateful and amused. “Did the town learn anything?” she asked, not meaning the river or even the old stubborn men with their lawn-chair dams, but meaning: did you. He told her about the boy on the bike and the woman in the Lions sweatshirt and the pasta and the way the water had stopped one inch from righteous; he did not tell her about the fear that had left a brown circle under his collarbone because he knew the words for that and they were not language anyone wanted to use in midmorning. She watched his face with the intensity of a person watching their favorite television show while insisting they were only listening to it from the other room. When Leah came in, his mother lifted her hands in a little victory gesture that made the bracelet she still refused to take off slide and click. “There you are,” she said, and Leah came to the bed with that same anchoring palm and sat in the little chair whose job was to pretend it had been built for comfort. The room adjusted its light and they drank tea that had been steeped beyond reason and they called it good. When Marko stood to leave, his mother did the thing she did without thinking; she patted his chest twice like she was stitching the day to him to keep him from losing it on his way out.

After the flood came a series of days with a courtesy to them, low wind and a patience for small chores. The town did its usual three-step back into habit. Leah took the list she had made for the library and translated it into a thank-you note with twenty-seven names, three of them spelled wrong in precisely the way those three people always had to be spelled wrong, and she took a strange joy in those wrong letters because they meant there were still facts to be learned about how people named themselves. Lila asked if she could borrow a stapler and then carried it away like a pet she was not sure she would be allowed to keep, and Leah yelled after her kindly about returning it and Lila yelled back that she would if staples didn’t turn out to be more interesting than they looked. Jesse organized the clinic into an ark of supplies for a family who had discovered that the water had found the exact place the baby formula was kept and expressed itself there more eloquently than necessary; he drove the supplies over with an embarrassed generosity that saved everyone pride.

Thomason handled his first scene with no one saved and one person left and came into Marko’s office and stood without sitting, holding his hat with two hands like a man who had never learned to hold the thing differently. The old man on Dock Street had had a stroke in his chair after he decided to watch the water recede the way you watch a play wind down; his daughter called a minute too late to prevent the thing and a minute too soon for it to have become part of the day the ordinary way. Thomason said “sir” twice in a sentence and then stopped saying it for fear it would become the only thing he could say. Marko did the thing that had been done for him by a man whose cigarettes had made him smell like a machine shop; he told a story that seemed unrelated about a turkey volunteer drive in a year with no weather to blame and the way a man had put his hand on the roof of his car, and by the third sentence Thomason’s shoulders had dropped and he had put his hat under the chair and understood he had been given permission to lay down one awkward weight and pick up another that fit him better. They went to the diner and ate grilled cheese sandwiches because grief needs dairy and bread and the columns of a menu to keep from talking too directly to the body, and Marko told him that the next time he would not be better and also that he would be better in three ways the other man would not recognize until afterward. It sounded like confusion and felt like relief.

In March, the school invited Leah to read on a Tuesday morning. An invitation written in a marker someone had been too impatient to uncap properly arrived through Lila, who delivered it as if she were carrying a note from a king and also a kitten. Leah said yes because saying yes to a room of children who were not her students and yet might briefly be was like being offered a spare key to a house she sometimes walked by and admired. She picked a small book about a fox who learned the names of things by sitting very still, and then she picked a thinner book in case someone cried early and the teacher had to handle it. She asked Marko to come because the school always liked a sheriff who could kneel, and he came because the idea made him braver than he wanted to admit. The children listened in their varying ways—one with his fingers in his mouth, one with her head tipped as if she were hearing another story and enjoying two for the price of one, one with the intense stare of a gavel. Leah’s voice softened at the right places not because the book demanded it, but because she understood the architecture of a room with thirty hearts in it and the way you had to play the corners. After, a boy with a cowlick asked if the sheriff’s badge was heavy and Marko said only if you wore it when you were supposed to be doing something else, which got a laugh from the teacher and a long thoughtful look from the boy. Leah slipped a bookmark with a quote nobody in that room could quite understand into the boy’s backpack because sometimes sentences are seeds, and it is not your job to stay and watch them search for light.

Later they walked to the playground and sat on a swing without swinging like people who had decided not to get dizzy. Marko had the look of somebody who had let himself care in a way that made him more himself; Leah had the tired satisfaction that follows speaking aloud to a crowd without needing to climb a ladder. He told her he had dreamed of a house where the walls were maps and the floors were a river and he had to decide whether to go barefoot, and she told him she had dreamed of a room where every chair was a different person she had ever known and she was expected to choose one to sit on. They agreed that both dreams were reasonable and ridiculous and that it was good to have them on nights when the town slept.

The day after the reading, Nina brought down a box that had lived in Leah’s closet since a decade that felt like a number without a face. It contained too many letters to be read in one evening and too many photographs to be sorted into stacks without mischief. They sat on Leah’s floor and let the box demand their lives for a day and then gave it what they could spare. There was a picture of Leah at fifteen with hair that looked like an argument and a smile that looked like someone telling the river it could sit down now; there was a picture of Nina wearing a dress that belonged to a person ahead of her in age by five years and in confidence by none. There were letters from a man who had worked alongside their father and kept punctuation in his pocket for later, letters that used the word proud without pretense and ended not with love but with the plainer sincerity that men of that generation had been taught to trust. Marko saw a photograph of Leah’s mother standing on a chair planting something in a pot with a look of skepticism toward the plant’s chances and tenderness toward her own foolishness and understood in an instant where the ring had gotten the habit of cooling against the collarbone of a woman who would not remove it on command.

“Read me something,” Leah said, not because she could not read but because some words are better in a mouth not your own, and he did; a paragraph about the smell of motor oil in winter and the way it got into the cuffs of every shirt and the way some jobs invent history faster than people can, and he found his throat thick and then he didn’t. He told her he had put his number in the emergency contact space at the hospital that night and asked if she wanted him to erase it or keep it in its box, and she reached over and put her finger on his pulse and said, “I thought you understood we were not erasing so much as learning how the page takes ink.” Jesse knocked later with a small cake from a woman who ran a bakery out of her kitchen and a slantwise willingness to be included in whatever this was. They ate the cake with forks that did not match and argued about whether the frosting was ambitious or merely well-meaning, and the argument made them happy in the way that small tastes can, no matter what was in the box on the floor or the ring on the chain or the river outside, already back to pretending it was always this tame.

A storm refused to organize itself in April and blew around for three days making everything rude without being disastrous. At the end of it, the sky took a breath and unrolled a blue so frank it embarrassed bugs into hatching. Marko went out to Carson Road for the first baseball game and let boys laugh at him for not knowing the names of anyone under fourteen anymore. Leah came with a lawn chair that pretended to be comfortable and sat with the kind of attention you promise but rarely deliver, clapping with the same seriousness for the boy who struck out as for the one who made second with his hat crooked and his heart jumping. Thomason’s girlfriend brought lemonade and a look on her face that said she had fallen for a man who sometimes didn’t know what to do with his hands and she found that handsome. Mrs. Reyes wore a hat she had bought thirty years ago for funerals and decided was appropriate for spring, and scooped her azalea hedge experience into a set of opinions about stealing bases that made the men who had thought themselves generous with advice sit with their mouths closed like good guests.

After, Marko and Leah walked home past the water tower that was pretending innocence and the firehouse that was beginning to be a community center in all but bylaws. They discussed the new grocery clerk who apologized for handing you your change as if she had kept it too long, and agreed they would eventually tell her to stop with gentleness and a cookie. They passed Jesse’s place and heard a radio through the open window, a station that played the music of people making declarations in garages, and Jesse waved a wrench from inside and told them to come look at the little thing the engine had done that was a miracle or else a belated compliance with remembered maintenance. They stood in the garage with their arms folded in the exact way men fold their arms when pretending they understand diagrams and Leah threw a rag at both of them and said they were theater-goers at a very specific show and should at least clap with confidence.

On a Sunday afternoon, Marko found a letter on his porch with his name on it in a hand he knew from the library’s sign-in sheet. It was from the man who had signed up for the reading class and had figured out the bus schedule and had decided to write down the route in his own letters because memorizing is a kind of love and writing is another. The letter said thank you in a way that included Leah and Lila and Tamika and the kid who had sharpened the pencils and the dust that had allowed itself to be the first thing moved out of the way so the learning could come in. He took the letter across the street because he had learned that keeping certain pieces of paper to yourself is a different kind of selfishness than he needed to practice this year, and they read it together on Leah’s steps with the spring making a racket under everything. When they were done, Leah folded the paper in on itself with the care she reserved for the messengers of other people’s bravery and said she would put it somewhere dumb and perfect like the freezer, and he said his mother kept certain things under a stack of potholders because she believed in heat and barrier both, and they looked at each other as if they had been led toward a map they were only now realizing they were capable of holding between them without tearing.

The call came at dusk on a day that had made itself long for no good reason. A car off the road behind the old silo, the cliffside kind of drop that turns your knees to calculations before you have even started down. He heard the youngness in Thomason’s voice on the radio without needing any words. He said he was en route and he was, the cruise control of a man’s resolve adjusting to terrain. At the edge, a smear of dirt and a set of tracks where tires had thought about friction and then opted out told the story with the blandness of evidence. The wreck sat in a notch like a thing placed precisely there by a hand you would prefer not to think about. For once the town’s appetite for audience failed it; there were only two men and a sky and the sound a person makes when they try not to let the world know their breath has turned itself into labor. He went down with the rope like a man going into a well and said names in the voice you use to keep another person from leaving the room too soon. He had gone down into other kinds of difficult and this one required all the hands he had. The woman was not dead and not not and said one word—boy—and he saw it, the kid’s shoe against the seat, the ridiculous dinosaur on the Velcro, and then the kid, small and lodged between safety and luck. The math came and he did it, breaths and cuts and straps and how to bring two bodies up a hill that did not have an opinion about your plan. When they were up at the top, the world came back with its lights and noise and the woman’s hand banged against his sleeve once as if to sign the day, and the kid’s eyes found him with an expression of absolute betrayal that turned into gratitude while he watched—a look he would not be granted often in his line of work. Thomason made a sound of relief so naked it made him proud, and later he sat on his porch and found his hands shaking in the way that does not announce itself until the action is done.

Leah came and sat with him without asking and without making the chair creak, a trick she had learned from years of living near people she did not want to wake. She did not say “are you all right,” because it is an almost useless sentence. She asked what the boy had said, and he said, “Nothing; he made the sound you make when you are afraid of heights and then realize the ground is very good,” and she nodded with her whole body and they leaned back and watched night do its better version of rescue. He told her that the boy’s shoe had had a dinosaur on it and that he had hated dinosaurs when he was a kid because he did not want to think about big things that were gone, and she laughed with one eye closed because she could see him as a boy with thin shoulders and a stubborn jaw and she liked him for that. The green bowl sat in the window with something ridiculous in it—a roll of twine, a pair of scissors, a quarter—because this was the week the oranges had not made the trip up the valley, and he thought: sometimes we put the wrong thing in the right place and it still works because the place is right.

The next morning, the river said nothing about the night’s rescues and went on being itself. The town went back to lie about how early it got up and how late it went to bed. Leah went to the library and did the small mercies, and Jesse went to the clinic and made a list of medications a person ought never to run out of and then made another list for the ones people ran out of anyway. Marko checked his tires and his oil and his tone of voice and found each reasonably in range, and then went to see his mother who had forgotten which person he was today but had not forgotten how to look pleased to see a man come through the door. He found himself, in the middle of spring, saying a winter sentence he had stored like a coat in a closet: as if it might break. He stood with that in his hands and looked across the street at Leah kneeling on the porch with a coil of rope left over from something that had not required it, and he thought, perhaps the trick is to learn to hold. He did not say it aloud. He went over and held the other end of the rope and let the morning teach them both how to stand there with it, the sun doing its work without comment, the river pretending to be simple one more day.The weeks that followed the rope on the porch taught them how spring conducts its business in a town like theirs: not as a fanfare but as an accumulation of permissions. The dirt path to the post office forgot to be frozen, then forgot to be mud, then remembered to be walkable. The firehouse kept its extension cords coiled like sleeping snakes under the folding tables as if readiness could be laid down and summoned without drama. Leah’s laugh found more air around it and went out into rooms without apologizing first. Marko learned the names of two new men at the feed store and found himself saying their names back to them before sleep, a private inventory of the day that no one had asked him to keep. The radio maintained its steady rattle; if anything, it sounded relieved, like a throat after a cold, and even static seemed to carry a note of patience.

It was a boy with a dog who found the bumper in the shallows behind the old factory where the river liked to collect the town’s tin cans and its secrets. He was the kind of boy who always had to be told twice to wear socks and whose freckles appeared early in the year like newsprint under thin skin. He ran down Main with his hands extended as if the information needed balancing and shouted Sheriff in a tone that landed somewhere between alarm and pride. Marko followed him down to the bend, not hurrying so much as narrowing his attention, and there it was: the angle of rust under water that wasn’t just a rock being dramatic in sunlight. He called Thomason because Thomason needed to get good at standing in the first circle of a story without being swallowed by it, and he made the other calls that turned the riverbank into a small polite chaos of men and women who had learned how to be useful without stepping on each other. A couple of old-timers arrived in their baseball caps and leaned on the fence with their mouths set, their eyes doing the noticing their mouths could be trusted to keep.

They pulled on waders and slipped into water that still had winter’s sting near the ankles and searched by touch for the rest. The current tried to move them into the old low complaint that any place with water has about people in it; they did the math in their legs and kept upright. After fifteen minutes that contained a year, Marko’s hand found a door seam, and then the dumb blunt nose of a car, and then the way metal, when it has been softened by time, becomes almost tender to the press of a palm. The winch did its slow chant and the river let go in the reluctant way a child lets go of a toy you’ve told him belongs back on the shelf. People made the sound people make—one syllable long, rising and falling with astonishment’s shy grammar. The car breached, moss-draped and dirt-matted, a shape both familiar and more than a little mythic.

It was a sedan from a year the camera on your phone would not recognize at a glance, the kind of car built when steel had a different story about itself. The plates had nothing left to say. The glove compartment gave up a sheet of paper that had been pulp too long to confess. When they pried the trunk, somewhere a rumor stood on its tiptoes. They had done this before, in smaller ways, with lost bikes and wheelbarrows and the occasional shopping cart that would be embarrassed to be seen like this if shopping carts had the good sense to have shame. They had not, most of them, done this exact thing. The coroner came with his case and his face that could do solemnity without seeming to approve of death one way or the other, and the tape went up because there are times you must draw a line simply to remind yourself that lines exist.

Leah stood at the fence with her hands in her sweatshirt pocket, shoulders back against the sun. She did not call his name or wave or make any gesture that would require acknowledgment. She was part of the small congregation that gathers whenever a town’s past rises heavier than gossip. Jesse arrived with the quiet that men learn in rooms where bad news is shared softly and took his place, a little back, hands pressed into his jacket, like a man measuring the distance between what he can help and what he has to witness. The dog sat down and blinked, bored of history, and laid his chin on his paws and made a small groan to remind the day of dogs.

Word found names with the efficiency of roots in wet soil. By afternoon someone thought it was a Buick. By dusk someone remembered old Mr. Brandt’s son had driven a Buick that color once upon a time, even if this car hadn’t had a color in a decade. How long had it been down there? long enough for rumors to sand their edges, not long enough for grief to let go of its grip entirely. The state sent a man in a windbreaker who disliked mud and loved paperwork; he took photographs as if light were a witness he could bring to court. Thomason went stiff the way you do when you solve a riddle only to discover the answer requires you to go knock on a door. Marko put his hand on the kid’s shoulder and left it there long enough for the kid to breathe differently.

They didn’t pull bones from the front seat, not that day. They took the car away with the dignity you extend to an elderly relative who has to be helped down the front step in view of the neighbors. The town hissed and murmured and then, because it had its errands, went back to them with its eyes lifted to glance at the river each time it passed a window. In his office, Marko took a file from the drawer labeled FAMILIES and then from the drawer labeled OLD NOISE and put the two beside each other. The file about Mr. Brandt’s son was thin and smelled like someone else’s cigarette smoke—not the bad smoke of the present but the old film that clings to paper and makes it behave like it belongs to a decade that had bigger collars. A missing person report from a summer when he had been short enough to duck under the library desk without being scolded. The notes did not pretend to be exhaustive. The boy had gone after a fight with his father; there had been a girl—there is always a girl, though sometimes the girl is not a girl but a plan—and then nothing. The town had said he ran. The town had said he was seen in Columbus in ’03. The town had said he sent a postcard from a county fair in Nebraska that read wish you were here with no return address and handwriting like its own ransom note. The town had said so many things that didn’t require a river to explain itself.

His mother did not remember Mr. Brandt’s son, or remembered five boys at once when he said the name and pinned them all to one lanky outline. “His father wore his baseball cap into church,” she said decisively, which might have been true of an entire pew. “Your father always took his off at the door and smoothed his hair and then put the cap back on after the benediction, like he thought God had a rule about it and would thank him personally for carrying out the ordinance.” She smiled at her own recollection and forgot it in the same breath. Leah sat in the chair with the bowed cushion and took the memory as if it had been a letter handed to her by mistake and said she would return it to the right address when she learned it. When he told Leah about the car they had lifted, she closed her eyes for a beat longer than a blink and then opened them and looked not at him but at the space beside his head, as if even that much looking might make history anxious and prone to lie.

At the library that Thursday, she took the list she had made for Words and added a single line not for anyone else but for herself: Don’t make the dead do all the work. She told Lila to go get the copy of the map with the old boundaries of the county before the new road had persuaded people that it had always been there. She drew the river with her finger and then wiped the trace off the table with her sleeve as if she could keep its secrets from staining the room. People came anyway with their needs and their ordinary crises; a woman in an orange coat needed to figure out the form that would let her son play baseball if she wrote a note on school letterhead that she did not possess. Leah pressed the edge of a ruler into the paper and smiled the smile that invites people into thefts of propriety for good cause.

Late that afternoon, Mr. Brandt came and sat in front of Marko’s desk with the kind of subdued good manners that make grief almost unbearably polite. He had the hands of a man who had held the steering wheel of a truck through several decades of roads with their own agendas. He took off his cap and held it with the brim down, as if it might open and offer him, out of some ridiculous generosity, the certainty he had not had for twenty years. “You called,” he said, and his voice had the old well water in it that had not yet tasted of the town’s pipes. Marko didn’t push the file across the desk because paper was a poor translator. He said what could be said without the insult of cruelty masquerading as clarity, and watched a man’s face try not to be a field in high wind. Mr. Brandt was not, it turned out, a man who cried in the chair. He sat straighter and ran the side of his thumb along the seam of his pants and said, “Well,” and then, “Well,” again, differently, and then asked the first useful question of a long line of useful questions. After he left, Thomason looked up from where he had been pretending not to listen and said, very quietly, “I hate the way relief looks when it wears that suit,” and Marko said, “I know,” and thought how language sometimes goes respectable around suffering and tries to mind its manners until it has met everyone in the line.

The girl from that summer would be a woman now or a rumor. Her name was tucked in the file with a teenage flourish of looped letters that dragons would admire. Susan McCoy had worked at the Dairy Barn and had thrown a softball in the park with an accuracy that most of the town had politely ignored because accuracy in a girl’s arm made certain men uncomfortable. Ask her, the file suggested themselves; ask her if she remembers the way the boys slept that summer, the way they did everything with a kind of daily hunger a town cannot feed and does not dream of curing. But Susan McCoy lived three counties over and had taken her married name onto Facebook where her sons’ heads were shaved for team photos and her life had the bright, too-loud cheer of a person who had discovered that if you type cheerful enough, it can haul the day around like a trailer.

It was Paula who came into his office and leaned against the doorframe with the posture of someone who had never quite gotten over her affection for men in rooms making sense of civic trouble. She had a notebook again; maybe she had never stopped having a notebook, but it had been concealed before under a road atlas of wanting out. “You look like the man who decides whether the cake is done,” she said, and he laughed, because he had been thinking about ovens himself lately—the way heat transforms things without asking anyone’s permission, the way we tap the center to see if it springs back. “I’m writing for the county paper now,” she added without the pose of humility; she had learned to let the truth sit in the room with her. “They’ll want a piece that is not the state’s piece. The facts, yes, but the faces, too. I’m not asking you to go on record about anything you shouldn’t. I’m asking you where the town will choose to look so I know where to plant my feet.” He told her about Mr. Brandt’s cap and about the boys who had painted the heart on the water tower and then painted it out and about how the river had looked when it gave up the car, which was the hardest to explain because rivers don’t have faces and you cannot write about expressions on a thing like that without inviting scorn. She nodded and wrote two words—river body—like she was adding to a dictionary no one wanted to admit they used.

Leah did not stay away from the parts of the story that had teeth; she simply refused to put her hands in its mouth. She came to the edge of the fence and said hello to Mr. Brandt and spoke about the way his wife had made pickles with dill from a garden that never admitted to poor soil, and the remark let the man stand for a few more minutes before the weight of being in public collapsed his legs and sent him home. She made a list on a small card for herself that would not be read by anyone but her: Bring soup. Offer chairs. Ask people to sit with dogs when people go where dogs cannot. She stopped at the Captain’s Catch and asked Emilio if he would tell the boys to stop making jokes about catching more than cod; he raised his hand and said, “I am a fisherman and a man, I am doing my best,” and she said, “Do a little better,” and he grinned and did, because his heart was ridiculous and good and could survive a woman’s bluntness.

The county forensics did what they could to give the bones their first real pronoun in two decades. They took the time they had to take. The town waited in the way towns wait, by telling the story to itself over dinner and in the aisle with the bleach and outside church where the steps turned wet with people’s feet; repetition has a way of pinning things to the board even if the pin cannot find the exact middle. At the firehouse, Tamika folded cots while telling Lila to stop apologizing for tripping over the same corner of a mat; at the clinic, Jesse reordered what he already knew he had in the back room because he had learned that the body likes to find a rhythm wherever it can. On his porch, Marko sat in the chair that had belonged to his grandmother and the wood remembered her with an admirable loyalty; he pressed his thumbs into the arms where hers had made two polished grooves and thought about all the ways bodies leave traces besides bones.

The identification, when it came, came on a Tuesday, as if grief entire had enrolled in public school and learned the calendar. It was Mr. Brandt’s boy, which everyone had already decided in their private weather forecast but needed to hear from a person sworn. The state man with the windbreaker had a way of making the word confirmed sound like mercy; he had probably practiced it in his car. There was a meeting of the town that night in the church basement because that is where you hold things like this—the humidity of boiled coffee in an urn, the chairs set in a pattern that approximated equality, the little podium that could be moved to one side if the room needed to be more like a family and less like a hearing. Paula stood in the back with her notebook at her side, not raised like a weapon but close enough to make the moment real when she would need it, and Leah sat near the aisle because she did not like feeling hemmed. People said the things people say that they have practised like scales, and people said other things that were only in their throats because the day had put them there without permission.

Marko spoke with the precision he had taught himself to acquire around pain. He did not say, We failed you. He did not say, You ran, and we were glad to believe it. He said the boy’s name with its middle name; he said he had liked a particular kind of gum when he was sixteen that everyone else hated, a detail the room sat upright for, hungry for particulars the way a body grown thin is greedy for protein. Mr. Brandt stood and did not thank anyone or blame anyone; he said he would like the town to remember his son as a boy who had meant to come back. A woman in the fourth row made the small sound of someone’s old grief stepping into the aisle because it had decided to walk tonight, and Leah looked at her, and then at Marko, and saw the way he kept his hands open even while holding the paper he had written down the facts on.

After the meeting they went home in clumps with their sentences trailing behind like streamers that would get caught in bushes and be found in the morning damp and embarrassing. Leah and Marko walked together without holding hands not because they were hiding but because their bodies had already touched so many other bodies that day—handshakes, sleeve touches, brief squeezes of forearm—that leaving space between them felt like the kinder option. On her porch, she touched the ring with her forefinger and then touched her lip unconsciously like a woman remembering a line of a poem she had not written down. “Promise me something small,” she said, and he laughed before he could stop himself because she had named his particular appetite. “What?” he asked, and she said, “Promise me you’ll leave your mug here sometimes without washing it. I’ll be fine. I’ll wash it. I just want proof you didn’t try to finish being yourself before you crossed the street.” He said he could do that, and left the mug on the counter, the ring of coffee underneath drying to a stain like the first letter of some unknown alphabet.

Jesse came by later with a face he had never worn before in front of the two of them. He looked guilty in the way only lucky people can look guilty. He had an offer. A clinic in a town up the valley had a director with a heart attack and a want-ad that had sounded like the town begging in a voice it didn’t want recorded. They had called his name in the way you call someone’s name down a hallway with the doors all open. “I haven’t said yes,” he said quickly, and then, hedging honesty toward itself, “I haven’t said no either. I thought dumbly once that I was going to be the kind of man who never left rooms he had made comfortable for himself. That turned out to be a vow I took because I was scared of ambition and clothed it in virtue. Leah, I want to ask you if leaving would be a kind of harm here. Marko, I want to ask you if staying would be, for me.” It is a trick of the hour between one lamp being turned off and another being turned on that it lets men ask their questions with the courage of dimness. Leah told him what she believes about work—that it is a kind of honest love when done without vanity, that you give your days where your presence makes the arithmetic of suffering and relief add up to something survivable. Marko said that any town worth its salt ought to be a place you can return to without making a speech. Jesse’s shoulders found their proper position, and he laughed, private, at himself for needing permission. “Even if I go,” he said, “I will be at the firehouse when the generator stops behaving. Some things you don’t resign from.” He left with his hands empty like a man trying on the idea of departure in his pockets and not yet sure where to put his fingers.

The state wanted paperwork and boxes and formalities. The family wanted to choose a day. The weather wanted to be beautiful in a manner that would make everyone angry if they noticed it and so Marko asked the weather to roll its shoulders and behave humbly, and it did not listen, which taught him nothing new about the weather. They stood beside the plot that had had a name on it without a body for years and they put down flowers the way people put down the truth when they have finally decided not to argue with it. At the edge of the cemetery, Mrs. Bowen instructed a child that he could ask a respectful question and the child asked, “Do bones feel cold?” with the seriousness of a scientist, and Leah said, “Not in the way you mean,” and the boy nodded, satisfied, and went back to looking for the one ant that had found a way to make the stone into a hill.

His mother had a day in there that worried him; she went down into herself like the river in drought and you could see the lines of the bed under the quilt too clearly. He sat with her in the afternoon with the bad tea and the little window view of the flat brown field they had insisted on calling a lawn. She asked after an aunt he had never met as if the woman had been by that morning, and he said what the daughter in him might have said if he had been a woman and in possession of that exact kind of true lie: “She was here. She looked good.” Leah came the next day with lemon bars that had failed at being aesthetic and triumphed at being what they were supposed to be, and his mother, who had been cranky for three mornings in a row and therefore honest, reached out and touched the girl’s wrist with her fingertips as if checking a pulse, and said, “Thank you for not cheering at me,” and Leah said, “I have a strict policy about where I keep my pom-poms,” and his mother smiled and then bit her lip against the tide of forgetting that always made her embarrassed, which was the part that made Marko want to go out behind the building and lodge a formal complaint with the sycamores.

At work, forms grew more tedious as grief did what grief does and left behind the hangnails of administration. He signed things and corrected line items and made sure Mr. Brandt never had to encounter a person at a desk who was having a bad day and wanted to take it out on a checkmark. He reminded himself that if you only do the useful tasks that make a photo-op, you have not really done your job. He took Thomason out to the stretch of river above the bend and pointed at the way the water changed color where depth altered and he said, “That right there, that’s where people think they can still touch bottom, and that’s where we see them go under.” Thomason nodded like a boy being let in on a secret about women or engines. “And in town?” the kid asked, and Marko said, “In town, the place where depth changes is where a man has to take off his hat and say he does not know what to do. If you can put your hand on his shoulder at exactly that second, you’ll get through the day without the situation turning into three paperwork piles instead of one.”

It would have been satisfyingly symmetrical if the car in the river had had something to do with the heart painted on the water tower, if the boy who had been missing had been the boy who had climbed high and dared paint and dared erase, but the town refused to become its own parable that neatly. That boy moved to Indiana and sells parts for tractors and has a daughter who likes saxophone; Marko knows this because the man sent him a Christmas card once that had a picture of him in a coat that made him look like a person who had learned to forgive the wind. What the river offered instead was the lesson it always offers if you are listening: people go where they do, and only some of them come back for the version of them you remember. The rest live their lives somewhere else in good faith, and you cannot make a case against them for that.

All of this was the kind of news you fold small and put in your wallet, the kind that makes the day a better instrument if you keep it close. Leah’s literacy nights added another table and a box of reading glasses someone donated in a frenzy of wanting to be useful beyond money. Lila read out loud a paragraph she had written about the way the new coat rack leaned and called it a metaphor and Leah laughed so brightly that the men at the back table, who did not care for that word, smiled despite themselves. Jesse said yes to the clinic up the valley and then confessed he had not slept well for three nights because committing to the new thing made the old thing loom in a kind of narcissistic farewell in his head. Leah told him she was throwing him a cake regardless of what his head did, and he groaned and then asked if she would make the frosting less ambitious than last time.

In the middle of all that, in the middle of the steadying and the necessary flares, a girl named Avery went missing for three hours. She was seven and curious and had followed a cat with three legs two blocks farther than she was allowed. Half the town raised its blood pressure and a third of it raised its voice. Leah stood in her doorway with the ring high on its chain because she had been leaning forward saying the girl’s name like a prayer, and Marko drove streets he had driven all his life with a new set of lungs. They found the girl in Mrs. Reyes’s back yard, under the hedges, feeding the cat crumbled milk crackers and telling him in a serious voice that the reason you fall down sometimes is because you forget to bend. The relief that attended that retrieval felt vulgar after the car and the bones; it felt like cheering at a funeral because someone told a joke that landed exactly right. Mrs. Reyes scolded someone who needed it most and made lemonade like a champion, and Marko called his mother afterward and she answered the phone and said his name right away, which felt like a reward he had not earned but was glad to be given.

In April, the county supervisors called, with the bland menace of calendars, to ask if he would consider standing as the interim for a position one rung up from the rung he had chosen as his one; the person who had occupied that rung was retiring in the long complicated way people retire now, like ships deciding whether to pull fully into harbor or just sit there in the channel and let the rope slacken. He replied the way a man does when he knows the answer and has to train his mouth to be brave enough to say it. “I am a small-town sheriff,” he told Leah later on the porch, bringing the word out of his chest like a thing he wanted to see in the light. “And not because I cannot imagine other things. Because I do. But I have seen what happens when men decide to be the idea of themselves in a room without furniture. They lean until they fall over. I like the stairs I know.” Leah nodded and did not make the cheap pun she wanted to make because she liked him and because cheap jokes in the presence of someone else’s wrestling mark you as unkind on days when kindness is the only instrument allowed. “You turned down something people would call bigger,” she said after a minute. “Do you want me to tell you that makes you brave or foolish?” He smiled and said, “Neither,” and she said, “It makes you here,” and that was the word he wanted even if he had not known it.

Jesse’s going-away party was the best kind of wrong. The frosting behaved like a roof in heat; the cake gave up under the weight of affection and slid slightly to one side, and they decided to call it a metaphor before anyone else did. The clinic crew brought a poster with handprints because handprints are the proper autograph for the work they do, and the firehouse let itself be the room for laughter that night instead of the room for distress. Leah gave him a book rolled in brown paper and tied with string because ribbon was too fancy and string made you think of things you could fix; inside was a battered copy of a novel with a library stamp from before they had moved to barcodes, and on the title page she had written simply Be where, which Jesse pretended to need punctuation for and then laughed because he knew. He hugged Marko with the embarrassing sincerity that men earn at thirty-five, and said into his shoulder, “Make me earn coming back,” and Marko said, “Go do something worth migrating for.”

On a Tuesday like any other, after all of that, having done the little and the big in their proportion, Leah took the ring off. It was not a ceremony. She sat at her kitchen table with the green bowl full of something that would irritate the eye into thinking it loved it—limes, probably, because oranges had gone out of season and lemons were trying too hard—and she rubbed the chain between her thumb and forefinger and eased the ring over her head. She set it near the bowl and let it sit there without any speech about fathers and their old languages. When Marko came over later with the mug he had promised to leave and the coffee that would make him forget and then remember, he saw that the silver circle was not where it had always been. He did not ask a question that would make the ring into a witness. He sat and drank and told her about Thomason’s face when the kid got the bicycle certificate for wearing his helmet even though his friends had botched the courage quotient of adolescence and laughed at him for three blocks. Leah told him about a woman who had written her name for the first time without the letters going uphill and had cried quietly into the notebook lines as if the paper had promised to tell no one; she had left the ring on the table in reach of her fingertips and had not touched it once.

The water tower held its paint. The heart, if you knew where to look at dawn, made its seasonal ghosting at the edge of the new coat, a lesson in persistence and weather and the way both have their own stubborn grammar. Marko drove out to the overlook above the bend where the river curves its body like a woman trying to sleep with a baby on her chest and sat with his thermos and his day and watched the water not do a single trick for him. Behind him, somewhere up the hill, a man in a windbreaker was already forgetting his own name because he had said it while calling numbers to too many desks. In front of him, somewhere down the water, a boy on a bicycle with a dinosaur on his shoe would scrape his elbow and run to a woman who would not say You’re fine but would say I see, I see, good boy. He put his hand out as if the day were something he might hold, and felt, in the muscles of his palm and his wrist and the bones of the forearm that had learned to be useful without praise, the slight tremor that being alive makes when you are very quiet. He did not still it. He let it be there, the little animal that lives in your body and the town’s body and the river’s, and he thought again, as he had thought before and would keep thinking, as if it might break, as if it might break, and as if, held right, it might not.The morning after the ring had taken up its new gravity on the table, Marko woke with the peculiar calm of a person who has not been asked to solve anything before coffee and did not trust the quiet. The world outside had the look of something recently rinsed and set to dry, the air holding a trace of last night’s rain as if the town had hung its shirt on a chair and would put it back on a little damp without complaining. He poured into the thermos because habits get blessed by repetition, and he thought of the way Leah had left the circle of silver near the green bowl like a small moon come to rest beside a planet. He did not try to read the placement as a code he would be graded on; he put his palms on the counter and felt the wood still a little warm from yesterday’s sun, and he walked his day into being by naming what it would require—forms, streets, a conversation with Thomason about how not to apologize for everything, a check on Mr. Brandt that would be as undramatic as kindness had to be to be trusted.

Paula’s piece ran that week with a photograph so ordinary it made the town briefly suspicious of it, the picture catching the curve of the river with the old factory hulking in the background like a man pretending he had sat down on purpose. She had written in a tone that made even the people who distrusted tone lower their cups and listen, the article studded with the names you give a day when you want it to sit still while you tell it: the boy who had found the first glint; the old men at the fence; the woman in the Lions sweatshirt who crossed herself and laughed at herself for doing it; the dog bored of history. She had written Mr. Brandt as if he were larger than the outlines of his grief and smaller than his hat, which is to say, she had made him a person. She did not make the river speak or pull parable out of its sleeve, and for that the town forgave her everything it had wished to argue about. Marko read it at his kitchen table with the particular tension that comes of seeing your day turned into something you can hand to someone else, and he felt the small relief of not being misquoted by a person he had once loved and had learned to stand near without reaching for anything. He folded the paper not at the crease but at the paragraph where Paula had used the word again to describe that ghost of a heart on the tower and smiled because he recognized the day she had stolen the word from him with her ear and paid him back here with a little dignity.

He drove to Mr. Brandt’s at noon, a time that felt less like a pastoral visit and more like a man stopping by because he happened to be passing. The yard had been cut in lines that meant a son had once tried to get out of himself by making rows, and the porch smelled faintly of dill that had tried to come back in a pot and failed and been forgiven for its lack of ambition. Mr. Brandt sat with his cap on his knee like a ceremony that didn’t require music, and he said, “She did all right by us,” which was a benediction that did not need a subject. They talked about the weather until the weather had done its work on the room, and then the man asked the questions that the county had to pretend not to hear: could he see the car, would there be a place he could stand where he felt like a father and not a spectator, had anyone remembered the boy’s gum, that ridiculous flavor that tasted like metal. Marko answered what he could and was silent where silence was not an insult, and when he left he pressed his hand against the rail and left a warm print that faded in fifteen seconds and still felt like a signature.

At the library, Leah had a small cluster of people around the copy machine because the machine had decided to make one of its moral stands about paper choice and orientation. She handled machines the way she handled men, with respect for the parts that had been overused and with little patience for the settings someone had changed and then forgotten to mention. She wore a shirt with sleeves she had pushed above her elbows and a ribbon of sweat at her hairline that made her look industrious in the way a good day can make you proud of being a person who has moved objects from one place to another for other people. The ring on the table at home had not pulled anything visible from her expression, and he loved her for how little she asked the world to announce her changes. When he told her about Paula’s piece and the way Mr. Brandt had said it, Leah nodded and then, with a half smile, said, “We ought to bake Paula a cake and then pretend we bought it,” which was her way of not making a ceremony out of civility. Lila, overhearing as she fed the copier its pride back, asked who Paula was, and Leah said, “An old friend of the town,” and Lila wrote the name on her palm with a flourish as if she might meet the person later and would like to remember to offer a hand.

Jesse’s last week in town before the move rearranged the clinic into the kind of mess that looks like grief and is only boxes doing their honest work. He labeled everything too precisely, a man trying to make the future gentle by giving it a map of his drawers. He came by the library twice without a reason and once with a reason that sounded like he’d made it up in the doorway. “I think the scale is lying, and I think it always has,” he told Leah with a straight face, and she deputized him to carry two boxes of paper cups that would be cups regardless of their weight or opinion. The three of them—Leah and Jesse and Marko—stood on her porch one evening with the kind of awkwardness that makes jokes beg to be told and held them back because jokes would have been a disrespect to the week’s edges. Jesse said he had not realized people could learn him in such an unexaggerated way, and he felt improved by it, and Leah put her palm on his shoulder and said, “You’re better when you don’t rehearse,” which made him snort at himself in the way that breaks the spell of solemnity without wounding it. When he left, he turned at the foot of the steps and did not wave and did not salute, but he grinned with his head tilted as if listening for permission, and Marko found himself grinning back as if he were a boy at the edge of a field where two other boys had already chosen teams and this was the moment you find out if your name will be shouted or only nodded, and how both are, in their own way, a mercy.

The barn fire came in on a heat that had nothing to do with weather, a midnight orange the town understands in its gut and pretends to find surprising each time. Marko had just convinced his body to behave as if sleep were a thing men could ask for and get when the call shivered the house and slid down his bones. The line of pines behind the old Watkins place looked like a choir practicing the part where they pretend to be modest. He could see the plume from his porch, that flat kind of glow that never belongs to anything you would say out loud you love. The volunteers met the night like it owed them money, trucks at angles, the hose unraveling a clean, muscular logic on a yard that had always been messy around the edges. Heat stands at a height you can feel with your teeth, and he felt it, and he knew where to place himself, not a hero’s mark but the place where the crowd thins and stupidity thrives. Thomason moved exactly right—too fast and then not, burning off the rush and then finding his breath and letting it work for him instead of against him, and Marko filed that away as a pride he would not tell the kid he felt because praise has to be earned and then handled with a dry towel, not flung at a boy like a bucket of water.

The Watkins girl had gotten out with a rabbit in a towel against her chest, white-faced and laughing because some laughs are the body’s refusal to collapse into the dark. Mrs. Watkins kept trying to go back in for a pan that “nothing sticks to, you hear me,” and had to be held by the elbow with decency and a little harmless lying about where the pan had been set, and Marko found himself talking to her about spices as if nutmeg could keep a roof from collapsing if you pronounced it correctly. He did not see the board until it found him; his left hand took the insult and then adopted it without cursing. Pain is rude without being imaginative, and this was that kind, a high white pain that makes you blink once and count backward to something like sense. He shook his fingers, made his hand count anyway, and finished the thing in front of him because finishing is sometimes the only trick you get. Later, after the roof lay on the floor in a new geography and the air moved from scream to story, he looked down and saw the blood dried into a line across his palm like the seam on an old baseball and admired, with a detached gratitude, the way bodies make a mark of what they have passed through and then go on delivering the day to you as if you had not asked too much of them.

Leah cleaned the wound at her kitchen table because a person should be doctored in a civilian room if possible, the kind of geography where your body will not learn to tell a story you cannot stand later. She did not cluck. She did not scold. She poured the small brown bottle with the ceremony of a church you had not planned to attend and watched his face without making a face on his behalf. He felt the sting and put his jaw where men put their jaws when they want to move the pain to a smaller address. The ring sat on the table between them catching a squared-off glint from the fixture above, and he realized, with that stupid surge of affection you cannot teach yourself to be ashamed of, that he was proud of the object for minding its own business for an evening. Leah wrapped his hand with a gauze generosity usually reserved for packages meant to arrive intact, and she did the tape with neat flats because loose ends always find a way to bother the skin they live near. “You count in your head,” she said, and he said yes and found himself defending the counting as if it were a piece of furniture she had questioned as a match to the room. “It works,” he added, and she said she would never ask a man to stop doing a thing that worked simply because she preferred a different rhythm, and he laughed because she had told him about the rightness of his own instinct and he felt taller for it.

In Fairmont, a week later, Nina met them at the door with a list in her hand and a bruise under her eye she had disguised with powder and honesty. “Cabinet versus head,” she said, not waiting for the question and not offering sorrow where it was not due, and Leah kissed her sister’s cheek in a way that reminded both of them of being children and not being asked to explain what they had bumped into. Their mother had rearranged the photographs by frame size rather than importance, a reorganization that made the wedding sit next to the camping trip where everyone had been bitten and laughed about it because the tent had a hole and the rain had been only ceremonial. She greeted Marko as if he had been to see her yesterday and had come back to finish the sentence she had enjoyed, and when she looked at Leah she said “you,” with relief, and then took Leah’s hand and placed it flat on the bed as if she were returning a borrowed book to the shelf it had come from. They drank tea that had been left to steep while an attendant had been called away to tell a story in the hall, and they did not complain because bitterness sometimes tells you you are alive.

It took until the second day for the conversation about their father to be well behaved enough to be invited in. Nina called it before dinner, as if to say, let us get this done and then eat with relief. Leah held the ring in her hand before she spoke, not in a dramatic way, but with the simple logic of showing an object a story it belonged to. Their father had been a man who could build a shed with a window that looked like it had always meant to be there and could forget to come inside to eat until the ketchup dried in the bottle and you had to slam it against the plate to make it obedient. He had also been a man whose hands, when he was wrong and late and cornered by his own childishness, had learned the wrong lesson from how power sits in a wrist. The ring had been, he said, the device that kept his fingers from curling when the heat rose in his neck; he had lied kindly with this statement and also told a measure of the truth. “He loved us,” Leah said, and the sentence did not try to rescue anything from the parts it left out. “He loved us and he did not always love what life had made of him, and he learned to put his hand on the table when the other part of his hand had a memory it wanted to practice.” Nina told a story about the summer their mother had sent them to the store with a list and a five dollar bill and a note asking Mr. Petrovic to let them keep the change, and how they had stood there at the counter feeling like bankers and queens, and how when they came home their father had been sanding the chair he had kicked the week before in a way that made the sandpaper sound like an apology. Marko listened the way a man listens when he knows that being allowed to hear a thing does not mean he owns it, and when Leah placed the ring back on the table he felt like a person excused from an exam he had not studied for and still been nervous about.

The day Jesse left, the town found itself wanting to be the kind of place he would brag about to the new town without sounding like a liar. The clinic crew gathered around the hatchback that had served as a delivery van for tinctures of hope, and someone tied a ribbon to the antenna that tried to look jaunty and failed wonderfully. Tamika hugged him with the ferocity you reserve for men who had understood the jokes without your explaining them, and she told him that if he forgot how to flirt with a mop bucket at two in the morning she would drive up the valley and perform a refresher course. He put his hands on Leah’s shoulders and looked like he might tell a story and then thought better of it, a rare and decent restraint, and said only, “Thank you for never telling me I was right when I wasn’t,” to which she responded, “I try to limit people’s lies for their own good,” and they both laughed because they were the kind of friends who could raise their own eyebrows at themselves. He shook Marko’s hand and then did not let go immediately, an odd little pause where a man decides if he will make his sincerity visible and then does, and he said, “Hold the center,” not as an order or a compliment, but as an observation; there is always a center, and it always requires someone. The car went down Main, ribbon absurd, Jesse’s arm out the window not in farewell but as if checking the weather, and the town watched itself watch, a moderate spectacle that felt, even to those who complain reflexively, like something worth their notice.

Mrs. Reyes organized a fair without calling it a fair because the county had a monopoly on permits that would have required too many signatures and thus had a way of insulting the idea of joy. Tables appeared along the library lawn with pies arranged in careful moral hierarchies, and the boys from the auto shop set up a ring toss with old gaskets that had been cleaned within an inch of their life and gleamed like something wealthy. Leah sat with a jar that said Donations For Words and refused to enforce the suggested amount, which led to the two most generous acts of the day: a girl who poured thirty-seven cents in pennies with ceremonial concentration, and a man who had a habit of setting his rage on the counter at the Captain’s Catch like a bag of nails handing over two twenties with an embarrassment that made his ears red. Marko carried folding chairs and then pretended the carrying constituted the first half of dancing, which allowed him to accept being dragged toward the patch of grass where the high school band had decided on Motown for the afternoon in a way that confused people who had thought the teenagers did not recognize tunes older than their own birthdays. He did badly and well, which is how most men dance at forty in a town that knows their mother’s name, and Leah let him, because she had learned which kinds of competence mattered and which kinds did not.

Paula stood near the lemonade with her notebook at hip height like a secret she was not going to tell until it had agreed to behave. She had a look about her that women wear when they have grown into their faces and found that their faces do not require apology, and when she caught Marko’s eye she lifted her cup and made a small salute without trespassing into nostalgia. They met halfway under the shadow of the maple that had once been struck by lightning and had forgiven everyone for discussing it for a summer. She told him she had gotten invited to write something longer about the river and the way towns teach themselves to forget and to remember, and he said he hoped she would make the forgetting as plain as the remembering because pretending otherwise would be a sin of style and heart. She mentioned she was seeing someone who fixed bicycles with a zeal that had nothing to do with commerce, a man who believed in the holiness of chains, and he smiled and told her to make sure the man’s hands had a clean line of grease at the nail and no more, because that was how you knew a person loved their work and did not drown in it. They parted as if they had not parted once badly, and he felt in his body the quiet dignity of not having to inventory himself against anyone else for an evening.

His mother had one of the days that peel a body down to its infrastructure and then leave the room to see what the bones remember. He found her looking out the window at a man walking a dog and she asked him if he had remembered to take the bread out of the freezer. He said yes and then went to the freezer and took the bread out and set it on the counter because being caught without receipts was not a kindness either of them needed. Leah came in careful with a sweater over her arm because bringing a sweater is the gift of a person who does not want to tell your body how to behave but would like it to have options. His mother patted the sweater with a ceremonial two-fingered tap and declared it acceptable to its purpose, and Marko felt in his chest the small wreck of love that happens when a parent applies ancient authority to the present’s little artifacts. Later, on the porch, Leah let him put his head on her shoulder in a way he hadn’t since he had been nineteen and tired for reasons that had not yet declared themselves, and the simplicity of the posture did not embarrass him as it would have once. He stayed there a long minute and then sat up and drank the cold coffee anyway because the body knows what it likes even when the tongue votes otherwise.

The county supervisors called again about the rung above his rung, this time with a hint of impatience, which was their right since calendars have their own pride. He told them no as if it were only weather, an answer not requiring the ceremony of a letter, and hung up and went to the window and watched a boy on a bicycle negotiate the uneven seam where the sidewalk had been lifted by a root. The boy did it with the kind of casual mastery that makes you jealous for a second and then grateful for bodies that can still be taught. He sent a text to Thomason to take the new kid on third shift out to lunch and talk to him about the way people look when they’re lying to themselves, a skill useful for writing tickets and for living. He sent a message to Leah that simply read Rib roast at the diner special, and she replied with a cartoon of a cow with a suspicious smile, and the absurdity restored the day to its proper pitch.

It was the third Tuesday in May when the town learned the name of the boy whose bones had been in the river had been something else once, a nickname that only two men and a girl had called him and that had not appeared in any paper. Mr. Brandt stood up at the diner at breakfast and said it under his breath to Marko at the counter, and the word felt like a small animal released into a room where you could watch it choose a corner and make itself at home. It wasn’t really for the town; it was for the father and the sheriff and maybe Leah later if she wanted it. Names have weight they conceal under their clothes, and this one had carried a boy through three summers and a fight on a porch and then into a car and then down into water. Marko held the name in his mouth for a minute the way you hold the last piece of ice, and then he let it melt and swallow, which is a way of honoring a thing without turning it into a banner.

They found a day to scatter the last uselessness of the car’s story, a morning with no thunder in it and a false breeze that made the river seem industrious. The county men wore gloves because gloves made them feel clean in the presence of weathered filth, and the old men at the fence wore their hands bare because pride resists rubber. Paula did not bring her notebook in a visible way; she let her pockets hold her for once. Leah set the green bowl on the fence post with three apricots in it because apricots are the kind of fruit that looks serious until you bite and then humiliates you with juice, and she watched a child reach up and choose one with the solemnity of courtroom ritual and then giggle at his own mouth. Marko stood with his thumbs in his belt loops like a man trying on a posture he had inherited, and he thought about how the day did not require him to speak and thus might be the most honest day in weeks.

That night, Leah put tomatoes in the green bowl because tomatoes were what the neighbor had brought and you do not offend gifts by pretending you had a plan, and she poured him tea without asking what he wanted and he drank it. The ring still sat by the bowl, a citizen of the table for now, reverent and ordinary in turn, and he realized that some objects only learn their manners when removed from the theater of the body. They talked about a woman from Words who had read her own grocery list aloud by accident and then blushed and then kept reading because bravery is often nothing more than refusing to walk away from your own error, and they talked about Thomason’s tentative friendship with the man who fixed the copy machine because loneliness recognizes competence even when it does not know what to do with it at first. He told her about the way his mother had forgotten the word for the wooden spoon and called it “the stir,” and how he liked the sound of it and wondered if we had named things wrong all this time and ought to let the verbs rescue the nouns. She told him he should write that down in his small book that he pretended he did not keep, and he did not deny the existence of the book.

Summer did the thing where it pretends to arrive in a fanfare and actually sneaks in through the pantry—more gnats, less patience, a plastic chair that doesn’t cool off before morning. The boys posted up in front of the gas station with confident calves and precarious notions of immortality. The women counted the jars in the cupboard and decided whether this was a year for peaches or not. The firehouse took the generator out to show it some sun and then put it back like a pet people pretend to dislike in public and lavish upon at home. The water tower kept its decorum, and if you woke early on Tuesday you could see the heart thinking about declaring itself and then deciding the better part of valor is flirting. Marko and Leah ate dinners standing up because the long days kept offering them the second half of something that needed doing, and when they did sit it was with the relief of a person who has just found a chair in a room that had convinced them it had run out.

On a night that smelled like laundry hung in a house without air conditioning, they walked to the bend with no intention of rescuing anyone and the pleasant suspicion that they might rescue themselves a little. Leah had a stone in her pocket she admitted to having picked up in front of the school when no one was looking, the kind of private theft human beings commit in the service of keeping their hands busy; she turned it between her fingers as if learning its grammar. He told her about the call he had taken that afternoon from a woman who said her neighbor’s chickens were abusive, and how he had gone and spoken to the chickens and they had listened with more respect than most men, and how the women had been nicer to each other after he left because authority had absorbed the humor of their lives and redistributed it without cost. She told him about a sentence a man had read at Words that had the word chapel in it even though the man would not have been found dead in one, and how the word had suited him anyway—cheap light, old boards, a pew’s honest discomfort—and how she liked the way language refuses to be polite about who gets to use it. He took her hand and did not do anything noble with it, just kept it, and she leaned once against him like a person closing a drawer, and they stood there until the mosquitoes discovered them and sent them home.

In sleep, he dreamed of the river without-metaphor, just water doing water’s old arithmetic, and of his mother tapping his chest twice with two fingers, and of Leah’s ring sitting on the table growing cool and then warm again in the morning as if practicing being a citizen of several hours. He woke at four with the good foolishness that comes of knowing you can lie still for twenty minutes and not be punished for it, and he counted those minutes like coins he could spend without being shamed. When the sun pushed its first stupid, honest wedge between the houses and the water tower, he got up and went to the window and saw the day admit itself and he did not rush it. He pressed his hand on the sill and felt the paint flake, a law of surfaces nobody sues over, and he thought about all the things he could hold and all the things he would only stand near, and he found himself smiling because what he had learned by then had not been complicated and had saved him anyway: you can train a body to some kinds of readiness and one of them is the readiness to be tender in the middle of town with your hat off, as if it might break, as if it might break, and as if, held with an ordinary, stubborn gentleness, it might not.
