Bogotá was a mountain of echoes and wires. From the balcony of the brick high-rise in Teusaquillo, just above the jacaranda tree that always bloomed a little too purple in July, Mateo Santamaría watched gray clouds snag on the Monserrate cable lines. He had woken with the metallic taste of rain, and an old word on his tongue that didn’t belong to him. Guarín. Not a proper noun, not anything modern. It clung like the scent of ozone after lightning. He wrote it down on the margin of a grocery receipt, in his precise hand, then crossed it out and wrote it again with a question mark.

The birds fought on the roof across the alley. Somewhere below, a boy hawked steaming almojábanas from a basket, while a radio whispered vallenato through two walls and a ventilation shaft. It was almost noon. He hadn’t slept. The tea had boiled twice—Mateo had gone staring into the kettle as if the enamel mouth could answer—and cooled in the pot to a skin of milk that collapsed when he nudged it with the spoon. The spoon quivered, as if afraid to be noticed, then settled.

“Te vas a enfermar, M,” Lucía’s message buzzed on his phone. The L in her name was shaped like an umbrella because that was how she signed her prints. “Sleep. Or come to the studio. We have yerbabuena. And goss.”

He thumbed back a heart and an ellipsis that he never completed. The city seemed close enough to touch and far enough to vanish. In the mirror opposite the couch he avoided his own eyes and studied the plants, the afiches, the white patch in the plaster he never repainted after he pulled a nail and discovered the wall’s fine veins beneath. If he looked directly at himself for too long the room went thin. It had started three months ago, after the storm that cracked a jacaranda limb and turned the living room into a spiderweb of shadow.

He had walked up from La Candelaria into rain so hard it was like walking through a curtain of beads. The lightning had pressed flat on the city, a luminous lid. He had been holding exactly twelve coins, because he liked dozened things; he liked mapping. A brujo, if that’s what he was—and he had never liked the melodrama of the word—wanted patterns to knit under his fingertips. Twelve coins. Four steps between cracks. Two names in the left pocket written on folded receipts for salt and matches. That night he learned the pattern of the storm’s handwriting, and he learned he could read it.

And when he read it the rain stopped falling on him, just for a breath, as if the city was considering Mateo as a wedge in the wheel. A child on a bicycle, helmet loose, skidded past, trailing the wake of water. A blue plastic bag stuck itself to a bony tree, goldfish-bright in the lightning’s blush.

He reached up and the plastic bag was a goldfish itself, for a second. Not a fish, but the idea of a fish. The mouth opening and closing in the rain and asking nothing, only surviving. Little flare. It was gone when he blinked. Later he told himself he was faint, or had been watching too many screens.

But after the storm the mirrors became unruly. They brought visitors. They brought echoes that were not his. He would move and the reflection would be one beat late. He would reach for the kettle and watch himself reach for the knife. Once, he saw himself open his mouth and a sliver of bright leaf—a scale? no, ridiculous—flash on his teeth.

Across the city the rumors started with street kids and vendors who stayed up late because the rent insisted on it. An old man at San Victorino, who sold aquarium gravel in small bags next to lighter fluid and phone cases, told it to anyone who would listen: there was a wizard—no, a loco, uno muy raro—who ate goldfish alive like communion wafers, right out of his hand, and when he did it the light bent. Also the price of guavas went up. He always added that last detail, because the price of guavas always went up.

The name grew: El Acuarista. A joke. A laugh. A disgusted click of tongue. They said he had a little glass bowl, cuenco de niño, with water so clear it looked like dry air until the fish flicked. They said he kept the bowl in the pocket of a dark overcoat, and you could hear it tap-tap against his thigh when he hurried. He was seen at San Andresito and at Lourdes and once, they swear, floating in a reflection on the Bogotá River without a ripple. Somewhere in there, someone started whispering that when El Acuarista fell asleep, he didn’t breathe.

Mateo stayed indoors that afternoon and tried to not look at the mirror as he dressed. He had a meeting he couldn’t reschedule with a curator whose mouth was always on the precise edge of a frown, and a promise to Lucía he could not keep putting off. He put on the slate-blue ruana his mother had woven long before she was too tired to count stitches, and he watched himself try to square his shoulders in fabric that always looked like armor. He felt less like a wizard than a boy in borrowed clothes, and then he laughed because if he was trying to avoid melodrama he was failing.

He slid the folded receipt from the nightstand into his pocket. Guarín. The word sat there like a pebble. When he stepped into the hall he left the mirror behind him but carried it like an ache. In the elevator his neighbor’s dog sniffed his shoes and sneezed, as if he had come from a river rather than a dry room nineteen floors up.

“Buenos días, Mateo,” said the neighbor, a woman with saint bracelets and a thick black braid. “No se te olvide el paraguas. Está de humor la montaña.”

“La montaña siempre,” he said, and smiled. He liked being ordinary with her. He liked saying nothing true.

Outside, the rain was a commentary rather than a deluge. Street vendors tucked their baskets under awnings and flirted with each other in low voices. The man who sold herbal roots had a new bottle labeled in handwriting so careful that it looked printed: para los monstruos. For monsters. He waggled it at Mateo with a grin and Mateo, without thinking, bought it. It was probably violet syrup full of sugar, or a decoction of common holdfast. He lidded it and slid it into his satchel like an amulet anyway.

On Carrera 13, near a shop that once sold film and now sold SIM cards and lavender incense, he heard his name pronounced like someone tasted it: Ma-TE-o. He turned, expecting Lucía. Instead there was a man in a gray suit no longer tailored to anyone’s life, chewing on a toothpick. He had a face like a peeled twig. The man didn’t repeat the name, just smiled like they shared it.

“Conozco tu tía,” the man said. “Mejor que tú la conoces.” His voice was not Colombian; each vowel had been ironed flat.

“I don’t have a tía,” Mateo said in English.

“You do,” the man said in the same language, more or less the same accent. He held up two fingers like a V and then broke them apart, opening a space. The air went tinny. “We will talk. Not here.”

The man walked away with a rhythm that did not match his shoes. When Mateo looked down he saw a smear of faint green on his hand where he had touched his own pocket, as if he had dipped his fingers into pond water. He rubbed it with his thumb and it vanished, but the damp stayed.

He nearly missed the light, and a bus honked as it scissored past. When he turned right, he nearly walked into Lucía, bursting out of a corner café with a paper cup and a paint-splashed coat and a paper crown on her hair. She bounced back and caught his elbow like she had always meant to.

“Estás pálido,” she said, stripping the cardboard ring from her coffee to slip it into her pocket. “Like a man who dreams in snow.”

“You’d make a good brujo,” he said.

“Bruxa,” she said immediately, because she liked the ‘x’. “Anyway, we have goss. Two gosses. One is about a man who eats fish—”

“Everyone’s eating fish,” Mateo said, opening the door for her, grateful to be folded into the smell of espresso and sugar. “It’s Friday, Lucía. The whole city’s a pescatarian for exactly fourteen hours.”

“Not like this,” she said. Her mouth was laughing even while her eyes stayed pinned to him. “He eats them alive, Mateo. Poof. Little orange coins. And when he leaves, the bowls on the stall are empty and the vendor swears he only blinked and did not agree to the theft of property. And. Two”—she held up two fingers; everything in the world came in pairs today—“I have a call. From the curator. She’s late. Which means you are free. Which means you will come to my studio, and you will do the thing you said you did last night and make my lamp flicker. I need a flicker in my life.”

He let himself be pulled along. He drank the coffee she put in his hand. In the corner of the café, a television played silent footage of rain marching down Seventh Avenue and men in raincoats pointing at a map. A ticker muttered something about a strange theft from the small aquarium store near Parque España: glass bowls cracked, no fingerprints. A woman named something like Vela or Velez explained that her fish had “volado”—flown—and then laughed at her own verb and clutched her throat when she realized what she was saying. Someone on the internet slowed the video of a security camera and circled a shadow with a red spiral. The shadow did not move. The red spiral did.

The studio was a second-floor room above a bakery. The stairs were flanked by paper marigolds left over from a Día de los Muertos party, too faded to be brilliant, too stubborn to throw away. Lucía worked in color-fields that hugged the edges of birds and saints. She had cut out twenty paper fish for a children’s workshop and hung them on a line to dry; they flapped when the door closed, the thread whining.

“See?” she said, throwing her arms wide. “All your favorite omens.”

“I don’t traffic in omens,” he said, and took off his ruana and spread it on the back of a chair. “I traffic in maps.”

“A map is an omen you can fold,” she said, waving this away. “The lamp.”

She had a lamp shaped like a pear with a glass shade. It had been broken and repaired so many times that it wore its cracks like a city’s street map. She wanted him to do the trick: make the filament sigh. He focused, and counted: twelve, four, two, twelve again, like everything had to reduce to a number that felt safe. He sank his breath into the layers of copper in the wall. In his mind the city was a body, the wires a nervous system, the lamps organs that brightened when the right nerve was touched. He curled his fingers and the filament replied: a quiet dim, a brighter bloom. Lucía said “Ha” like a magician’s rabbit had winked at her.

“You should charge for parties,” she said. “Weddings. Bar mitzvahs. Brujo Mateo.”

“Sanación,” he said automatically. He had learned to say it like he was bored with it. “I help people sleep. I help the water boil faster. I help bread rise. I am not a wizard; I am a neighbor with warm hands. No hats will be pulled from rabbits.”

Lucía’s hand slid across his shoulder. “You still smell like river water,” she said. It wasn’t a joke. Her fingers were cool. “Mateo. You sure you’re not doing too much?”

He wanted to tell her about the mirrors. He wanted to say the word guarín out loud and have her tell him it was a cleaning product or a forgotten town near Tunja. He wanted to ask if she had ever seen the sharp end of a reflection. Instead he said, “I had a dream last night that the city folded along the seam of Séptima and shook all the coins out of everyone’s pockets. The coins rolled downhill. The beggars got rich and the rich got angry and nobody could stop laughing. When I woke up my pillow was wet, but I don’t remember crying.”

Lucía leaned her head against his arm and watched the lamp tick-tick as it cooled. “You should write dreams down,” she said. “Stop giving them to coffee and salt.”

He stayed until the daylight poured itself thin. The rain came back. Someone downstairs baked buñuelos and the smell was almost too round to be borne. He walked home with his ruana in a shopping bag because he didn’t want the wool to get wet and heavy. On the way he cut through a market where a woman sold small things that pretended not to be alive. Sponges that looked like flowers. Coral that resembled the city’s own spleen. A line of little glass bowls like moons.

“You are the one who knows lights,” she said without turning, because that was what everyone called him when they learned he could coax bulbs to behave. “Can you fix mine?”

Her bulb was an old one, almost antique, with a coil that had forgotten its own path. He breathed on it and it remembered. The woman pressed into his palm a coin that had been sanded until the face was just a blur. He flipped it. It landed on edge.

“Do you dream with water?” she asked.

“Everybody does,” he said.

“Not like that,” she said. She repeated his name, tasting it: Mateo. “Beware of swallowing your name, hijo. If you forget it’s yours, it will forget you. And then when someone else calls it, you will go like a dog.”

He was tired. He wanted to laugh. He did not. He went home.

The apartment smelled like a storm had passed through it while he was away. The plants were leaning toward the mirror in a way plants did not lean. The kettle was tilted, as if someone had peered into it. On the table, his receipt: Guarín. Someone else had written underneath it, in a spidery hand: GUARDIÁN. He shut the door with his shoulder and pressed his palm to the wood, counting the panels with his fingers. Four. Twelve. Two.

“You’re seeing things,” he said, to the room that did not answer. It was something his mother had said when he was small and anxious about ghosts and men with knives for hands that lurked behind the water heater. “Estás viendo cosas.” Things were for seeing. That was what they were for. He turned on the radio and a man was talking about football, and it was both an unguent and a hiss.

The television sat silent like an eye he had taped closed. He wiped a circle into the dust on the screen anyway and then frowned at himself. He laughed. He glanced at the mirror because he always did; it was a reflex. He stood in front of it and tried to see the trick. His face was his face: sharp around the cheekbones, mouth a line he forgot to soften when he was thinking. His hair needed a cut. He smiled and didn’t look like a wizard. He squinted and looked like someone who slept on buses.

“Who are you?” he asked his reflection as if it could answer without help.

“El que era,” it said. The mouth did not move. The voice was not his. It was bright as a coin.

He fell backwards into the couch, only because there was something soft there to fall into. He told himself it was a hallucination. He told himself he had not eaten and his brain needed sugar. He got up and made a sandwich he did not taste. When he returned to the mirror he took it off the wall, not roughly, but with the care you take with a patient who might bite. He set it face-down on the couch. Then he paced himself into a pattern. Twelve steps to the bookshelf. Four to the window. Two to the kettle.

He could have called anyone. He called no one.

When he slept he fell into the dark not like a fall but like a slide. He put his feet onto something soft and chilled and he knew he was walking in the shallow end of an old pool. The tiles were mosaics of fish with wide eyes. His hands were not empty. He held a bowl. He was not himself. He was inside a man whose coat was dark and heavy and wet at the hem. The bowl was a little aquarium that had fallen in love with the idea of being a hand. He lifted it to his mouth. The water told him a word. Guarín. He drank what it asked him to drink. His mouth opened like a door. There was a flash of co—no. He woke.

The room hummed. The mirror, face-down, pressed its rectangle into the couch. The radio had wandered into a late-night ghost program where the host said ufologist with loving precision, and a woman described waking up with notes written on her ankle in ink that would not wash off. Someone laughed and the laugh climbed the frequency and broke. The air smelled faintly of aquarium water. His tongue had a scrape on it, a little divot as if from a scale.

He sat upright and sat there long enough that the corners of the room lost their edges. He went to the sink and spat. The sink caught something that winked and skittered. He told himself it was an almond skin from the bread. He told himself to stop. He told himself to breathe. Inhale: four. Hold: two. Exhale: twelve.

Before dawn, his phone vibrated itself off the edge of the table and into the plant pot where the soil was cracked like riverbed. He dug it out and saw a message from a number he didn’t know. The text was tiny and precise and in Spanish and also in something older, though it used the same letters.

We will need the key. You were given it when you were born: a name you could open a city with. Do not feed the fish. Do not answer to the man in the gray suit. He is not a man.

He didn’t answer. The number blinked then disappeared from the thread, so that when he scrolled he could not find its parent. He put his phone face-down. Then face-up. He did not move the mirror. He slept.

When the morning came the city smelled like fried eggs and cold smoke and Friday. He had already cancelled the curator. He promised Lucía he would see her later. He went to Monserrate. He walked because the cable lines, trembling in their wind, made him feel like he was about to be strummed.

Halfway up the path he met a woman with a pack like a small altar. She was not young or old. She had hair you could tie knots in. She looked at his hands as if they were bleeding.

“You’re late,” she said, and there was a sleepy bird on her shoulder that was just the right degree of unbelievable.

“It’s thirteen minutes past,” he said, because his brain kept the time like a miser.

“Late,” she repeated, and handed him a paper bag with two goldfish inside. The bag was full of water and their mouths opened and closed like clocks. “Carry this.”

He held it like a sacrament. He didn’t ask why. The woman walked up the steps as if the mountain had been poured for her.

“Do you know me?” he asked.

“Not truly,” she said. “But I know you enough. And I know that when someone splits themselves into weather, there is always a bowl to catch the rain. Your bowl has been walking around town. This is not a metaphor.”

“Is it,” he said, and his throat went dry. “Are you my tía?”

“No,” she said with something like fondness. “I am a person who sells herbs and doesn’t ask questions unless she gets an answer. Call me Naya if you need to call me anything. If you need to call me, call the mountain. It brings me all the calls anyone can stand.”

They walked. The goldfish swam like two thoughts, bright and bright. He remembered being a child and taking home a goldfish from a feria in a bag like this, and it had died two days later because he had wanted it too much. He had learned to want differently. You hold delicate things in your mind instead of your hand. You don’t close your fist. You map. You count. You breathe.

“Don’t swallow your name,” Naya said, as if she could eavesdrop on his private repetitions. “If you wake up with a taste of mercy or metal, come to me. If you meet a man with no breath, go away from him the way you go away from a shadow that points in the wrong direction.”

“The wrong direction?” He wanted a graph. The mountain offered no graph.

“He will stand with his back to noon and still his shadow will point to daybreak,” she said. “He eats the wrong end of things.”

They reached the white church at the top. The sky was right there. People were lighting candles and praying loudly enough to let their neighbors know it. A woman leaned over a railing to see if her exhale could reach all the way to Usme. Mateo set the bag of fish on a stone to rest his fingers and watched the surface crease.

Naya put a coil of something that smelled like sun into his hand. He was about to ask what it was called when she beat him to it. “Guarín,” she said. “That is one of its names. It is a plant that has been told three stories and believes all of them. If you burn it, something that was not paying attention begins to pay attention. A guardian. But the first name matters, so don’t burn it unless you expect to be seen.”

He wanted to tell her the word had been in his mouth at dawn, and he had not invited it. He wanted to say his reflection had spoken without the courtesy of lips. He held the goldfish and imagined his apartment with its couch and its mirror and its kettle. When he looked down at the bag again one of the fish was looking straight up at him with a frown he could read: don’t be ridiculous.

“Why are you giving me this?” he asked, lifting the bag so that the sun printed it on his knuckles. “I am not a man for fish. I am not a man who has pets. I am not a—”

“Wizard?” Naya offered, not mocking. “Brujo? Words eat themselves. All words are knives that have learned to not cut. You are what you know and what you forget. Carry them until you find their bowl. There is a bowl that is missing them. There is a mouth that misses them too much.”

He felt suddenly, perilously like crying. It was absurd. He wanted to stop doing strange errands for strangers, and he wanted to stop pretending he was not relief to be told what to do. He nodded and she looked relieved at his nod.

“You will be seen,” she said. “If you want to hide, carry a candle. People look at the flame and not at the one holding it. If you want to be found, blow it out.”

He went down the mountain with the bag cradled. A boy who had been scolded into politeness held the door of the funicular for him with overdone ceremony. Mateo smiled and said gracias because he had been similarly instructed. In the reflection on the funicular’s window, the two fish were larger than they could possibly be, as if the glass had downloaded a larger past. His face was pale and tired and older than he should be. The reflection beside his face was not Naya; it was the man in the gray suit, and for a second the man lifted his hand and set two fingers against the glass like a vow.

“Don’t,” Mateo said, not to him, not to himself. The funicular doors closed and the city rose up to meet him like an old partner, one used to being led and leading.

He went back to his apartment the long way, through markets that sold saints and knives and shampoo in one aisle. He bought a bowl because one should not store fish in a bag for long. The bowl was round and harmless. He took it home and filled it with water and poured the fish into it and breathed when they swam and the water did not cloud. He set the bowl on the table opposite the mirror, though he did not hang the mirror back on the wall yet. The fish blinked. He put the coil of guarín beside them and did not light it.

On the television, he twisted the dial to the news, which reported about a wizard nobody could prove existed. He turned the sound down until the anchor’s mouth moved without audios. He looked at the fish. One had a notch in its tail that made it easy to love.

It was later, while he was reading a page of a book he had already read, that the bowl plinked. It was the sound of glass against tooth. He looked up sharply. He said, “No,” aloud. The fish looked like no as well. The word in his mouth turned like a coin.

“Mateo,” said the room, though he was alone. The voice came from an angle. “You are what you know and what you forget. Remember this. There will be a door. You will be both sides.”

“I do not consent,” he said, as if consent was what magic ate. He felt foolish. He went to the kitchen and drank a glass of milk because somewhere a grandmother insisted. He rinsed the glass and put it down and it made a note like a bell when it settled against the counter. Behind him the mirror, facedown on the couch, sighed.

He did not look.

He texted Lucía: I have fish.

She texted back eleven fish emojis and the question: pets or omens?

He started typing I don’t know and stopped after the apostrophe.

That night, because the mind is cruel, he dreamed of a man with his face and not his breath, walking through the city with a small glass bowl in the pocket of a dark coat, a bowl that should have sloshed and did not. The man’s mouth was open. The goldfish in the dreams had the eyes of someone who had loved him once. He woke with water on his lips that was not his own. On the pillowcase, a bright scale clung, thin as a leaf. He wiped it with his thumb and it disappeared into the weave of the cotton. The word came back, which perhaps had never left: Guardian. No. Guarín. The mountain in a hearth. A plant that knew his mother.

He stood up and his feet ached like he had walked in shallow cold. He walked to the table and looked at the bowl. The two fish lifted their eyes to him and did not accuse. Their mouths opened to a rhythm he could count. Twelve, four, two.

“I will not eat you,” he said, and felt like a fool and not like a fool.

On the radio, someone had called in to the ghost program with a voice that sounded reassuring and then had slowly not been. “I met him,” the caller said. “He is not ugly. He is ordinary. He smiles as if he has misplaced something and wants help finding it. He lives with the wrong echo. He doesn’t know he has himself.”

“What does that mean?” asked the host.

“The shadow,” said the caller. “He and his shadow disagree.”

The host made a sound like humor, and the caller’s line went dead. Somewhere a window closed.

Mateo lifted the mirror and hung it back on the wall because he had started to feel like he was dishonoring the object by refusing it its job. He looked at himself and he looked like a man up night two nights in a row. He looked at the goldfish in the reflection. In the mirror the fish were three.

He turned around and there were two fish in the bowl. He looked at the mirror and there were three. He counted, because counting could not betray anyone.

“One,” he said to the one with the nicked tail. “Two,” he said to the other. “Three,” he said to the third one in the mirror that lifted its tail with a tilt that was almost a bow.

The third fish opened its mouth and the mirror’s glass breathed in. The room chimed.

He understood then that one of the names of the man in his dreams, the man with his face, was the same as one of the names he had gotten wrong. He understood, not in the way you understand a sentence, but in the way the body makes dark decisions. The bowl. The reflection. The shadow pointing to dawn. He understood terribly and only partly. He reached for the coil of guarín and did not light it. He closed his eyes and saw the city not as streets but as a well. He saw his mother’s hand pushing wool through the same place again and again until a pattern emerged.

“What did you do?” he asked the mirror. “What did I do?”

The mirror’s answer was not words. It was a picture of a man in a fish market with nothing but the sky in his pockets and water walking beside him like a dog, and he knew that the dog had his name in its mouth and would not let go. He watched until his breathing slowed and then he put the bowl of fish on the floor and lay down beside it and watched the way the water described itself when they moved their bodies through it. He must have slept. When he woke it was late afternoon, and someone was knocking on his door.

He opened it to find the man in the gray suit and the woman from Monserrate standing together like they had never hated anyone. Between them was a third person he did not recognize, a teenager with a shaved head and a hoodie that said PUBLIX because the donation bin made no geographic sense.

“We need to talk,” said the man in the gray suit, and when he exhaled he did not fog the air.

“No,” said Naya, gently. “We need to listen.”

“Siempre,” said the teenager, and rolled their eyes because adults always made it a proverb.

Mateo stepped aside and let them in. He felt as though he had stepped into someone else's story and been told to memorize lines without a rehearsal. The bowl on the table quivered. The fish stopped moving, then started again.

“You have heard a rumor,” said the man in the suit. He took out his toothpick as if it was a wand. “You have seen a reflection. You have chewed on a name. Someone is eating goldfish. This disturbs you because you are kind. But what disturbs me is not the act. It is the hunger around the act. Tell me, Mateo, where does it come from.”

“I don’t know you,” Mateo said, and the teenager snorted approval.

“No one knows him,” they said, in English, to annoy the man. “No one can say what he is made of. He is a suit full of wind.”

“I am a messenger,” the man said, not annoyed. “I bring closure. I bring the end of things that do not know how to end. There is a man inside a story who cannot stop eating what he loves because he thinks this is the same as keeping it. He is wrong. While he is wrong, the world burns edges. The city you love is fraying at the wires. The mountain holds its breath. It will let go.”

Naya held up a hand. “Which is to say: there is a crack. Between what is and what is supposed. If you put your name into the crack, Mateo, and retrieve it correctly, this ends. If you put your name into the crack and let it be swallowed, you end. This is not metaphoric.”

“I’m supposed to save the world,” Mateo said. It came out before he could stop it and sounded asinine and a little comic, so of course he thought of Lucía and how she would have said it with a better mouth.

“You’re supposed to close the door you opened,” said Naya. “That is the saving, sometimes. Not banners. Do not think too much of yourself. It is a lock and a key. You have been both, in different dawns.”

The man in the suit’s smile widened incorruptibly. “Or,” he said, “don’t. Let the fish be eaten. Let the bowl empty itself. It is a kind of mercy. To stop eating is pain. To continue is easier.”

The teenager threw a glance at the fish and back at Mateo. “He’s gross,” they said, meaning the man, meaning the man in the mirror. “Don’t be gross.”

“I do not eat goldfish,” Mateo said. The room did not answer. He could hear his own voice and did not love it.

“You might,” said the man in gray, and his toothpick, which had never had a taste, glinted. “You might tonight. You might only in a dream. You are a door, Mateo Santamaría. The door swings. You have always known how to swing. You like the math of it. The hinge and the weight. The step and the breath. The twelve and the four.”

“Call him by his other name,” Naya said softly. “If you know it. That is how to begin.”

“Guarín,” said the word in his mouth, but it wasn’t a name for a man. It was a name for a thing that burned. It felt like throwing a match onto wet wood. It hissed and made the water breathe.

“Guardian,” the teenager said, in their best English. “That is cheesy, right?” They thumped the couch. “Tell me we’re not calling him that. He doesn’t guard. He steals.”

The man in the gray suit shrugged and stepped toward the mirror. He lifted his hand and his reflection lifted its hand and it was not the right gesture, not the one you made when you touched glass. It made something inside Mateo’s throat lift like a bird. The fish bowl trembled. One of the fish turned and turned again, undecided as a coin in mid-air.

“You will meet him,” said Naya. “You will think you should kill him. Don’t. You would only kill your own mouth. Teach him to starve.”

“How.” Not a question. It fell, flat, dull, like a name he had been asked to repeat at a roll call.

“Call yourself,” said Naya. “Be called, and refuse. Learn to be hungry and do not eat.”

The man in the suit smiled like it was a party and he had just opened the door. The teenager blew a bubble of gum with both sincerity and scorn. The candle Naya had not lit guttered in the air as if the air had decided to act like flame anyway.

Outside the window, the mountain bent its head. On the table, the fish were three in the mirror and two in the bowl, and one neck of the city hummed with a different voice than the one it usually used. Mateo stood and counted the breath so he would not count other things. He closed his eyes and the name felt heavy in his mouth, like a weight he could lift and lift again until he had the right kind of muscle.

When he opened his eyes, his reflection was looking at him with something like pity and also like expectation. He had a face. It was his. He had a mouth. He had kept it. For now. He felt ridiculous, and also exactly like the person he had been when his mother showed him how to purl and he had gotten it wrong and the wool had twisted and then he had gotten it right.

“Stop eating,” he said to himself in the glass.

The man in the gray suit laughed, delighted as any villain. The teenager clapped once. Naya said nothing, which was her way of nodding.

Mateo looked at the fish, at his name, at the mountain. He did not feel like the world’s savior. He did not feel able. He felt called in the way a pot is called by water. He lifted the coil of guarín and did not set fire to it. He put it into his mouth instead and bit down. It tasted like sunlight told no, and like old wood. It tasted like a door that would not open because it was already in the room. He cried without sound and learned the shape of the hunger he would have to teach himself not to obey. He learned the feel of his own breath refusing.

He learned what not to be, and loved it, and hated it, the way a healer hates the fever as he draws it out and knows that he is asking the body to enjoy something the body cannot. The mirror shivered, and his face steadied, and the third fish in the reflection stopped trying to exist. He sat down, and the bowl made a sound, and the man in the suit took one heartbeat’s step back, and Naya smiled with her eyes like a person who sells herbs and knows how to stop asking.

He stayed very still. He let the hunger pass through him like a train he would not board. He let the city discover itself without him. He let the fish open and close their mouths without thinking of them as coins. He whispered his own name. He did not swallow it. He kept it at the soft roof of his mouth like a prayer you don’t say aloud for fear the room will hear.

He did not know what would be asked of him next. But the mountain was listening. The bowl was not empty. The door was, for a breath, the right kind of closed. He exhaled.

He did not disappear. He did not eat anything bright. He did not look away from his own eyes. He did not answer when the mirror, just once, called him by the other name that was not a plant and not a guardian and tasted like metal and rain and thirst. He did not answer. Not yet.After they left, the room kept their outlines like steam on glass. The man in the gray suit had leaned forward at the end, the exact degree of a person who remains polite at doorways so people forget what teeth are for, and said something about having a schedule to keep that was actually about dying. Naya kissed the air near his cheek and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear that immediately escaped and made a map of her jaw again. The teenager put a sticker that said NO GODS ONLY WI-FI on the back of Mateo’s remote and grinned to see if he would notice. When the door closed, he could still smell the coil of guarín in his teeth. The taste had the patience of stone.

He fed the two fish three pellets by habit, counting them in that same whisper he used for steps and breaths, then decided he had already disobeyed his new rule by feeding anything with a mouth. He would have apologized to the fish if that did not feel like inviting further absurdity. He stood at the window while drizzle fussed over the jacaranda’s purple leftovers, and realized he was grateful for a city that could be bored by miracles. Bogotá yawned and checked her phone and asked him to buy bread. He texted Lucía the word bread without context. She sent back a photograph of two conchas and a slanted heart.

She arrived before he could invent a reason to keep her away, knocking staccato as if she were writing on his door with her knuckles. She had a paper bag on her arm and paint on her face where she had scratched an itch with the wrong hand. She looked around, sniffed as if seeking the smell of scandal, and put her crown on his head as a hello. He let it sit there until it slipped over one ear and he became a crooked saint.

“You look like you slept in scales,” she said, squinting. “And like you lied to a priest about it.”

“I resisted communion,” he said, gesturing at the bowl. The fish blinked with the dignity of diplomats. “And I had guests.”

She saw the sticker immediately and laughed without explaining, which made him love her more for that particular meanness. She set the paper bag on the table and uncovered its contents: a loaf of pan campesino, a jar of guayaba jam that had probably been intended for a gift basket, and a handful of yerbabuena twisted into a ribbon. She took the coil of guarín between thumb and forefinger like a small fossil.

“This is not for drinking,” she said, though her tone asked permission to say more.

“It is for being seen,” he said, and realized with a jolt that telling someone one true thing did not trigger alarms. He told her about Naya as far as he dared without making her into a myth. He left out the part where the mirror tried to add a fish to his life. He left out the mouth that had opened in his dream. He did not say guardian or door. He did say hunger in a voice that made her put her palm on his back as if he were coughing.

“You will not be noble,” she said into his shoulder, as if she were speaking to herself. “You will be stubborn. That is better. Nobility eats too much salt.”

He cut bread, and they ate dumbly, which is to say with joy that forgot to perform. When she left, she touched the frame of the mirror as someone might touch the forehead of an unwilling child and said, “Behave,” to it. He watched her walk away on the street, her paper crown tucked into her pocket like a ticket to a play she had already seen. Then, because the word from the missing text—that instruction like a kindness—had told him to find the key he had been given when he was born, he found his shoes and his ruana and went to his mother.

The bus ride was a pool full of voices. The driver had hung three rosaries and a lanyard of laminated saints from the mirror so that the road wore a disguise of beads. A girl recited her multiplication tables in a whisper only she could hear. Two men argued without raising their voices, about a player who could not keep the ball at his feet and a pastor who could not keep his hands to himself; the phrase "no le da la gana" applied to both. Rain stitched a hem on the windows and let it be. When he closed his eyes, the motion of the bus turned into counting, a little god tapping his rib cage with a pencil: four, two, twelve, breath, repeat.

His mother lived now in a shared place where each room had a window the same size, and the walls had been painted in vigorous colors by someone who knew that ordinary objects are happier when they live inside a spice jar. The room smelled like hand lotion and peppermint. She sat with a blanket knitted in squares she no longer remembered how to finish, a softness in her lap that was more memory than object. Her face had thinned toward bird. She looked at him and smiled; then looked at him again and smiled again because sometimes that is necessary.

“Mi niño,” she said, the ‘i’ long and singing. “You look like your father when you are ready to apologize.”

“I am,” he said, because he always was. He sat where she could see him and let his finger run over the edge of the bedside table until it found the nick he had made when he was a teenager with a key. He asked her how she was. She told him about the women who came and went with nails like exclamation points and hearts that were not always as big, and about the bird she watched at the window that might not be a bird but a leaf with a good lawyer, and about the nurse who had a different laugh for every patient. Then she stopped, the way a record stops and leaves the room safe.

“Mamita,” he said, and the tenderness in the syllables made him grit his teeth. “When I was born. Who came? Do you remember the woman who helped? Not the doctor. The other one. Not the priest. The—”

“She had hair down her back,” his mother said, and lifted her hand to demonstrate the weight. “Black like a rope they were afraid to swing on. Her fingers were crooked. She did not smile much. She was not my sister and I called her tía because I needed one in that room. She cursed at the doctor so beautifully that he blushed and turned around. She smelled like beans. She made a noise when you arrived. She said, ‘Ah. There are two. But one is a song only.’”

He held the arm of the chair until the wood pretended to be stone. His mouth wanted to say I knew it and diffused into more useful breath instead.

“I don’t have a twin,” he said, gentle for what he was.

“Not with feet,” she said. She was not cruel. Her eyes were as ordinary as a bowl. “Sometimes it happens and you don’t bury anything you can hold. You bury a chance, m’ijo. She said there were two names for you then. The priest made himself important with water, but she said there is a name the city understands and a name the world is willing to be called in your direction. One for when your skin is cold. One for when you are hungry. She told me not to say the second one aloud, except once when you were sick, and once more if I needed to call you back from a water I could not see the bottom of.”

He could hear the funicular in the distance without knowing if that was real. He wished for something to hold on the table that was not his mother’s hand. He found the small wooden box where she kept relics that had no religion except hers. In it: a ribbon from the hospital, rubber gone stale, printed MATEO with the vowels smudged; a safety pin bent too far to be useful; a measuring tape; a blue bead with a chip; a small scrap of paper with a name on it in a hand he did not know. He lifted it.

The letters were not old. The letters were older than the paper. They made a word with corners in it, a word that tasted like it had been bitten; there was an x and a j whose job was to be ghosts, and there was a breath inside it that had not been transcribed. He tried to say it. It did not sit on his mouth. It sat on his tongue like something his tongue wanted to teach itself. He did not force it.

“She said the name would change if we changed,” his mother said, settling back into the present as if against a pillow. “Like a plant you move from shade to sun and it decides to become itself in new green. She said if you ever met your shadow and it asked you for your name, you should give it water and not an answer. Do you remember when you had the fever that would not sweat? I burned a little of the coil she gave me. It smelled like the field under the sky in August. And I said your name out loud. You opened your eyes and told me I had put the bed in the wrong place.”

“I probably had,” he said, and wanted to cry for the boy he had been and the lungs that had been small. “Do you remember her name, Mamá? The tía who wasn’t.”

“Guarín,” she said, like something she kept in her pocket. “Ana. Ana Guarín. She was from somewhere that made her vowels lie down. She fought with her shadow every morning because she wanted it to stay in bed. She said she was tired of being greeted by what was not her, but she was not tired of greeting. I thought she would live forever, the way you think of bread and think it is the whole oven. But then the year the mountain kept its rain, she did not come, and when I asked, people made that face like someone else would talk better. You know that face. You make it when you don’t know how to count a thing.”

The name stepped into his mouth like a guest who had always had a key. He understood then why the word had put its elbows into his morning. It was a person and a plant and a task and a promise, and possibly a street he had walked down fifty times without looking at the sign. He put the scrap of paper back in the box and closed it, because some things deserve patience and their own dark.

They talked until the room felt the right size again. She touched his face the way she always had, like she was smoothing a page and he was words that would volunteer to be read. When he stood, she put into his hands the ruana she had woven before her fingers had learned the tremor that made knitting into drawing. He did not tell her he was already wearing it. He folded the one she had given him earlier and left it under her pillow, so she would discover it and remember she still owned something heavy and stubborn.

On the bus back, the city showed him her old knees. He watched three boys skate plastic lids along the gutter and declare the one who made it to the drain a champion. A woman hawked oranges and curses with equal vigor. On a corner he didn’t know for this purpose, a man sold mirrors of all sizes, their surfaces pond-green under plastic wrap, stacked like windows against a wall. He did not look at them. He tried to keep all his reflections inside his skull where they could be counted.

At Parque España, a knot of people gathered around what had been a fish stall. The bowls were empty. The blue tarp had been pierced as if intense attention had drilled holes in it. The vendor, a woman with hair dyed red as a dare, had a napkin clenched in her fist. She kept saying, “It was not fair,” in a precise voice she had probably only used before to count change. The man who sold aquarium gravel gestured with a bag of hot stones like a priest with censer. “El Acuarista,” he said to anyone who was coarse enough to listen. “He does not even chew. Have you ever seen a man refuse to work with his own mouth? It is insulting to the body. And now the guavas are—”

“Up. Yes,” Mateo said when the man turned to include him. “I know. Always.”

The man looked at him as if he had been caught using private slang and decided to forgive him. “You walk like a thirsty person,” he said. “I don’t sell water. I sell things that act like it.”

“What do you know about Ana Guarín?” Mateo asked, knowing the market had a mouth that remembered all people who had ever spent coins in it.

The man’s face became careful. He took his toothpick out to think with it, which was a small theft he would never admit. “She swore beautifully,” he said. “She said the mountain had to be asked with elbows. She could fix a colic with a look. She made the priest call her tía. She once told me I looked like a poor imitation of myself and I said I was saving money. If she is in town, she does not use a door anymore. If she is not in town, the plants still think she is. That is all.”

“Thank you,” Mateo said, and pressed into his palm a coin with a face still visible. The man weighed it like a question and shook his head at something only he could see. When Mateo turned, he made the mistake of catching his reflection in one of the wrapped mirrors in the stall. His face looked ordinary and not like a man who could ruin a day. The reflected bowls behind him, though, were not empty. They were full of bright movement, a thousand small flames swimming in a place where no water had been put. He did not blink. He did not move. He turned away as if that was something he could learn to do.

The teenager appeared like a card drop, leaning on a post as if gravity had gotten boring. “You walk loud,” they said, and then, because they had the extraordinary courtesy of serious young people, they added, “Sorry. That’s a bad way to start. I should say hi, I’m Valentina,” and when he blinked, “Val,” because you looked like a cough when you said the whole thing.”

He almost laughed. “I’m still between names,” he said, which was a joke nobody in their right mind should have understood.

“Cool,” they said. “It’s the worst highway. We found something. Naya said to get you only if you’d eaten, because the last person fainted and hit their head and now whenever she looks at raw eggs she cries. But you don’t look like you’re faint. You look like you want to punch a mirror and then apologize to it. Come.”

The way underground was through a door that insisted it was a closet. The building had once been a public bathhouse, a municipal insistence on cleanliness funded for a year and then forgotten when something else insisted louder. The tiles on the stairwell were blue as a good excuse. Val’s flashlight skated over a mural of swimmers with arms like commas and feet like quotation marks. Moisture licked the walls with the fatigue of a job nobody appreciates. At the bottom, an old pool sat like a conversationalist no one had addressed in years. The water was low, the mosaic fish in the shallow end were chipped in their eyes.

“It smells like coins,” Val said, pleased. “Right? If you bite it.”

“Don’t,” Naya’s voice said from the dark. She stepped into the light with a jacket tied around her waist and that listening she did like a blanket. “He came through here.”

“The man,” Mateo said. It was not a question. He could imagine the dark coat and the bowl and the absence of ripples, and the way a person can walk through a place without giving anything back to it, like a thief in a house who does not steal objects so much as the air’s willingness to be breathed.

“The appetite,” Naya corrected mildly. “He is his hunger. He is not a man until he stops being just that. He came through here. The water remembered. It made a little note.”

She showed him on the wall a pattern of damp that did not match the usual drool of pipes. It was a circle in the wrong place. It had a bite out of it. He put his hand near it, not touching, and felt the skin of the air lift like the hairs on a dog’s back when someone ugly whistles. He counted helplessly: twelve in, hold two, let four out, and then laughed because he had reversed it, and that small incompetence replaced fear with shame, which he could use like sand.

Val opened a backpack and took out a glass candle with a picture of a saint who had been scratched out with a coin so now it was just a man in a robe of light and no face. “If you want to hide,” they quoted, “carry fire. People love a small sun. They forget to count the dark.” They lit it with a lighter that had a sticker of a frog. The flame wore the room like a crown.

“And when we need him to see you,” Naya said, “you blow it out. We will be where we are. He will think you are where he expects. He is not a god, Mateo. I know we give that word to everyone we mean to forgive. He is a mistake that learned how to keep walking. This is a room where mistakes come to drink. You have two choices. You can stop up the leak with your name and hold it there until it stops wanting. Or you can give the hungry man what he wants and hope he gets tired. He won’t.”

“What does he want?” Mateo asked, because pretending not to know was the only foolishness he would not forgive himself for.

“Only ever the first bite,” Val said, with the crisp brutality of clarity. “He wants to stop the pain at the perfect bite. That is why he never chews. That is why he keeps going. He thinks if his mouth is always beginning, nothing will ever end.”

He pictured his reflection leaning toward a bowl. He pictured the second fish in the mirror that did not exist. He pictured a man who wants to live only in a first moment, and understood for a sliver the comfort of that cowardice. Then he did not forgive himself for understanding.

“We will be next to you,” Naya said, because promises are a language and she had chosen it. “Val will watch the door. I will watch your mouth. If you speak the wrong word, I will slap your face.”

“Okay,” he said.

He sat on the lip of the pool, and removed his shoes, and put his feet in the cold until his bones made a sound he could only hear from the inside. The mosaic fish were more beautiful under water, even chipped, because they remembered their instructions. He took the coil of guarín and tucked it behind his ear like a student. He put the candle within reach and breathed into it until the flame leaned toward him. He let his mind do its foolish thing and laid numbers over the room until they behaved.

When it came, it was not dramatic. He had expected a person in a coat, a shadow that bent the wrong way. Instead it was the kind of arrival that belongs to thoughts. The air tightened. The water lifted its skin. The candle made a note like a spoon against glass. A shape pressed against the room from the mirror side and then chose a place to put its foot. He saw what a body looks like when it has forgotten the conversation with breath. He saw his own eyes not blink when a drop of water touched them. He saw a mouth he could have had if he had not had a mother whose hands knew when to push and when to wait.

The bowl it held was the same as his, and not. It looked like glass that has been thinking for a long time and decided to become lake. It held a fish that was an idea of gold, and he felt that muscle in him—curiosity, hunger, pity, some compound—rear up.

He lifted the candle and did the opposite of what he wanted. He blew it out. The room did not darken; it shifted. In the mirror of the pool, he saw himself walk toward the failing flame, obedient, and he did not move. He held. He learned what a muscle is for when it is disobedient. The not-man turned toward the ghost he was given, that obedient decoy, and leaned with his bowl toward the mouth that was supposed to be Mateo’s.

“Stop,” he said, and he heard Naya say a word that was older than the coil and the mountain, a word that had always meant Stop in a way all things learned as children. The not-man paused, not because of him, but because the word stroked him the wrong way and he fluffed.

“Está tan fácil,” the not-man said, and his voice was not a voice. It was a current. It was the sound a spoon makes when it slips through thick sugar. He was amused by language. He offered the bowl to the reflected mouth. “Just a coin. Just a light. Just a never.”

“My name,” Mateo said, and the scrap of paper in his mother’s cache unfolded its corners in his tongue. He said it wrong. He said it differently than it had been written, because the room was different than the room it had been written in. He said it with his teeth and his breath and the part of the throat that makes a closed door out of gut. The not-man turned his head. He looked as if he were smelling bread. He stepped toward the real him, leaving the obedient ghost to hold the place like a waiter.

“You have two,” the not-man said, almost fond, and that almost was the worst part. “Always greedy. Always holding the second in your cheek.”

“I have one now,” Mateo said, and swallowed nothing. He opened his mouth to hunger and did not feed it. He did the simplest thing, and it turned into iron. He sat still while his desire panicked. He let it run around inside him until it tripped and lay down.

The not-man came close enough that Mateo could see the seams where he did not meet himself. It is a mercy, sometimes, to see the stitches. They are proof that someone tried. He held out the bowl as a man offers a drink to a lover he means to seduce. “Just the first taste,” he said, and this time the voice had a little of Mateo’s music in it. “After that, you can be forever.”

He thought of the boy with the fish in a fair bag who wanted and learned. He thought of his mother’s hands, which had set bed and breath according to a private geometry. He thought of Lucía’s crown saved for another day. He thought of twelve, four, two, and how breath looks when it obeys a little and disobeys a little and makes a life out of that.

“No,” he said, again, and again, until the word stopped tasting like a trick. He said his name the way you say water at a well so the well remembers it knows how to rise. He held his mouth like a door he was not opening, not because he loved the room behind it, but because the corridor needed to be walked first.

The not-man wavered. Naya put her palm on the back of his neck, which is not where people put their hands to comfort someone. Val said, “Dude,” in a voice so full of admiration and disgust that it made a scaffold around him. The water in the pool shivered as if a breeze had learned to do something new. The fish in the bowl that was not his opened its mouth and closed it and stayed alive.

He felt the hunger crash into him and look for a seat. He did not make one. He let it stand there awkwardly, holding its coat, waiting for an invitation to hang it, and when none came, it complained softly to itself and became smaller. He saw the not-man’s hands tremble. He saw a breath begin in a body that had stopped the habit for the sake of a bad trick. He saw the shadow shift on the tile.

“Don’t die,” he said softly, because he did not like endings after all. “Just don’t eat.”

The not-man’s face did a human thing. It failed to keep an expression. He looked surprised. He did not speak. His bowl tilted, and a single globe of water leapt, held its shape as if proud, and did not fall where it had been meant to. It fell on the coil of guarín behind Mateo’s ear. The room inhaled the smell of field. The mountain found a long throat and sang once from far away. In the mirror of the pool, the obedient ghost dissolved, as all ghosts do when you ask them for identification at the right time. The not-man took in a breath that sounded like paper changed its mind.

The candle on the tile, unlit, forgot itself and made a small flame because the air had decided to be flame and resistance was boring. Val laughed once, high and not derisive. Naya took her hand away from Mateo’s neck and patted his cheek once, briefly, a slap softened into benediction.

It did not end there, because endings are for festivals and funerals. They are not for rooms where water learns a new grammar. The not-man took a step back, and the second, and put his bowl into his pocket carefully as if someone had dared him to be kind. He looked at Mateo as if he did not want to forgive him and was being forced to reconsider. He looked at Mateo like a brother, or a man who has just sat down in a bus seat he believes he selected and discovered that someone had saved it for him.

“You are not a god,” he said to Mateo, which would have been funny if it had been delivered as an insult. “You are a hinge.”

“I know,” Mateo said, and the relief of being called by the right insult almost undid him. “I squeak when it rains.”

The not-man smiled then, and his teeth were human. He turned, not as reflections turn, but like a man who knows where the door is. He took his own shadow with him. He left some of his hunger behind, like a person leaves a jacket on a chair in a room he means to return to. The pool breathed. The candle pretended to be politely tired and went out.

Naya sank down to sit on the cold tile with a sigh that had half a laugh tied to it. Val flopped, as only the young and elastic and temporarily immortal can flop, and threw an arm over their eyes.

“You guys are so dramatic,” they said. “You should, like, start a band.”

They exited in the loud manner of people who had survived an obvious danger and needed to make noise to be convinced. Mateo carried the candle because it made him easy. He climbed the stairs with the feeling of a person who had learned he was not terrible at his job. When they reached the door, the man in the gray suit was there, leaning casually against a wall, chewing on a new toothpick, as if he knew all doors and had decided not to use any of them. He looked very pleased with the day.

“Closure delayed,” he said, not displeased. “Fun. We can do this for a while.”

“Go away,” Val said, bored and magnificent. “Go be a metaphor somewhere else.”

“Children have such appetites for safety,” the man said. He looked at Mateo then, head tilted like a collector considering an object that had escaped a finger. “You will find that starving is a hard religion to maintain. You have three days before it learns a new trick. You have people. That will help and hinder. Your tía sends her regrets, by the way.”

“She is dead,” Mateo said, and the grief came out of him so suddenly he had to lean his shoulder against the doorjamb. It had been a gossip before. Now it was a mouth. “Or she is something else.”

“She has changed jobs,” the man said, which was crueler than a yes. “She is very good at looking like wind. She is less good at the part where she remembers to be held. Tell her that if you see her. She will be offended. That will help.”

“Tell her yourself,” Naya said. “You know how to make a call no one wants.”

He saluted them with his strip of wood and stepped aside. His shadow lay on the floor like a cat who had enjoyed daylight. It did not point the wrong way. That was almost kind. They went past him with their mouths closed and their eyes open, like good thieves farewelling a house.

It was evening by the time Mateo reached his apartment. The mirror on the wall held his face in the right delay. He checked on the fish as a man kisses a child’s hair to make sure it is still a child’s hair. Two in the bowl. Two in the mirror. He exhaled. He took the scrap of paper from his pocket and placed it on the table and did not look at it. He turned on the radio until the voices made a net the room could sleep in.

When his phone buzzed, it was Lucía. She had sent a picture of her lamp with its cracked pear-glass, lit, and in the reflection of the lamp’s glass, without the trickery of a mirror or a pool, he saw the crown on her hair and the shadow of a man he did not know standing behind her, reading something on the wall as if maps were edible. He did not say anything dramatic. He texted: lock, and she sent back kk which tasted both like surrender and like laughter.

He boiled water, mindful of the kettle’s mouth, and made tea with yerbabuena and a pinch of salt because somewhere someone’s grandmother integrated superstition with electrolytes and saved a life that way. He held the mug. He did not drink. He waited until the hunger inside him realized it was not receiving gifts every time it asked the right way. It sulked. He let it. He folded the ruana over the back of the chair with the tenderness you give a coat after it has shielded your back in rain. He went to the mirror and did the foolish brave thing of putting his fingers to his own reflection. The glass was cold. It did not give. He smiled.

“You don’t know the trick yet,” he told himself. “We can learn it slowly.”

The city breathed. He did not listen for the mountain because he did not need to. The mountain will never stop humming. He slept without deciding to. He dreamed of a goldfish that grew legs and walked out of its bowl and complained about the floor. In the morning he woke with his mouth full of a name he did not say. He wrote it down, carefully, on the margin of a receipt. He did not cross it out. He did not add a question mark. He folded the paper and slid it into his pocket, because this is how you carry a key when the door has not yet declared itself.By the time the second morning slipped under the jacaranda and the purple that wasn’t loyal began to bruise at the edges, the apartment felt like a mouth that had decided to keep quiet. The fish made small commas out of their bodies in the bowl and the mirror, for once, did nothing theatrical. He put the folded receipt with the other name into his pocket with care he would not have wasted on cash, then made coffee and did not drink it until it cooled enough to admit it was bitter. He listened for a noise that would tell him the hunger had found a new trick overnight and heard nothing but a bus complaining about gears and a child telling a dog to stop loving strangers.

Lucía’s photograph of the lamp sat bright on his phone as if it had its own wire to a sun, the ghosted figure behind her teasing the back of his eye like a word on the breath. He sent her another text and received a thumbs-up with an onion beside it because her emoji logic was hers alone. He waited for no sign and then chose not to wait. The coil of guarín went behind his ear because rituals that look like habits are easier to bear than the other way around. He put the ruana on although the day would soften, because he liked the way its weight told his shoulders where to end. When he opened the door, the hallway smelled like a cleaner that had lied and a neighbor’s breakfast. In the elevator he looked nowhere and everywhere, hoping the glass would just be glass, and for once the building allowed it.

On the street, the vendors were not bored yet. A man with a folding table had arranged his saints with their backs to the wind, and their faces made a choir of advertisements. Someone had chalked an enormous fish on the sidewalk, its scales each labeled with numbers that did not add up if you added them and made perfect sense if you linked them with a finger and a hope. A young couple argued with small knives for words and then laughed together because even their fight liked company. He found himself moving more slowly than the city and, irritated by that, forced his feet into the rhythm everyone else had been born owning. It felt like cheating and he enjoyed the ease.

The studio above the bakery already held the heat of bread like a stubborn cousin. Lucía opened the door with paint on the side of her thumb, as if she had just remembered she was a person and not a brush. She lifted her chin to his crown of plain hair, approved of its reality, and kissed his cheek with a theatrical flourish that made the baker downstairs laugh through the floorboards.

“You came before I had a plan to mock you,” she said. “I will improvise. Give me ten seconds. Ah, there, look,” she added, because her eye was promiscuous, “you brought me an ear garden.”

He touched the coil behind his ear and refused to be embarrassed by a plant pretending to be jewelry. “Today we practice not eating,” he said, not like a proclamation, more like a recipe you repeat to make your hand measure right. “And we practice not answering.”

She tilted her head and narrowed her eyes, which always felt like a compliment because she was reducing her view of the world to make room for you. “You are either very boring or very brave,” she said. “Either way, you will hold something while I sew a thread through it.”

The studio smelled like glue and varnish and a citrus he could not locate, and her lamp hummed a virtue into the corner. He let her hands put him to work, passing her paper fish that had dried drift-flat and threading them onto a string he held taut, so the line turned into a sentence and then into a banner. The television in the corner showed silent men in suits doing that hand gesture newscasters do, the one that implies gravity even when the subject is ridiculous. He did not look carefully enough to know whether any of those suits were gray and had scheduled death in their diaries like a meeting.

“Tell me a not-secret,” she said, the way you tell a drumming neighbor a beat you can live with. “Tell me the thing you can say without selling your liver.”

“Ana Guarín,” he said, and his mouth smiled at the shape. “Midwife. Tía who isn’t. Swore the way a well swears when you throw stones at it and it pretends it didn’t enjoy that. She helped my mother bring me to the side of the morning that contained rooms and furniture. She told my mother there were two names for me, and I found one of them in a box that remembered. She smells like beans and August. I think she is wind now, and I think the wind isn’t a promotion. It is just a job with poor benefits.”

Lucía tied a knot the way a child ties a shoe, with confidence and wrongness, then tied another that fixed it. She looked at him in the space between bows. “If I were wind,” she said, considering, “I’d be the kind that ruins hair at weddings. Not the hurricane. The cousin that arrives drunk with gossip. Tell your Ana that if she needs a second opinion on taste, I am available and cheap. What happens if you burn your ear flower? Do you become legible?”

“Naya said being seen is an invitation you should intend. Today I intend yes, but shyly. The not-man—hunger—is learning, and someone told me it likes to learn fast. If I call too brightly, I call him too. I would rather he answer the wrong door.”

Lucía held a paper fish up and made it kiss the air beside his nose in blessing. Then the blessing left her hand as she turned toward the lamp. “The lamp is behaving,” she said, no longer teasing. “The filament is steady. But last night when I turned it off, for a blink it made a picture it shouldn’t have. A bowl. And not the pears we do not buy because we spend our money on paint and phone credit. A bowl like a moon pretending to be cheap. There was water. I saw a flash of orange like a bus. Then nothing. I only tell you because you look like a man who is bribing a god with not sleeping. If I become a mirror, you do the opposite of what you usually do.”

“Look away,” he said, and she grinned at having her language beaten to punch, then sobered as a cloud stepped through the room.

He lit the coil because hiding was not a reasonable game in a city that ate secrets for dusk. The first breath was dust, a promise of taste. Then the guarín spoke the field into the studio. Heads would turn in the hallway, and some would sneer, because the smell reminded bodies that their lungs had done more in older times than sit in classrooms and sigh. He placed the money of that attention carefully, turning the coil toward the window, letting the scent write its letters into the afternoon. Lucía breathed it and looked at her saints, who convincingly pretended not to notice.

“Hi,” she said to the air, as if the air had knocked. “We have tea. We have bread. We have a boy who insists on being a hinge. We have patience if you tear small pieces off it first.”

The décor answered first. The lamp’s crack-lines caught the smell and decided to glitter, a cheap trick that still felt like affection. The paper fish on their line turned with no draft. Somewhere, a child across the street laughed as if they had just driven a pencil into the back of a chair and claimed credit for a crime. The coil’s smoke lifted its shoulders and braided itself into nothing. Then, quiet, without drama, the window’s reflection thickened for the appetite of a breath.

He saw her as you see in heat, when the constraint of a thing loosens. No face, the way wind is a face to itself, but a decision that had learned to take human-size corners. A rope of hair and hands that understood the heritage of rope. The drag on the room was familiar, the way a room changes when a person you love steps in, and your back lets itself stop. He did not say Ana because names were coins as much as fish were; instead he touched his own chest as if she needed the reminder of which body got sought.

The figure’s twin gestures answered him: the way a woman offers a curse like a blessing because language wears both coats, and the way a person with crooked fingers signs quick with wrists because they learned to suffer joints early. The voice that arrived knew too many kitchens to be purely spirit. “You forgot your manners once,” she said, and he swallowed his laugh because he had not known yet that was what he had done. “Say hello to the breath when you take it. Say goodbye when you give it back. Say your names like there’s soup in them.”

“I am greedy,” he said, and again it would have been funny if it had been simply true and not also a plan refusing itself. “I open doors and stare at hinges. I let the wrong dogs carry my name.”

“You are stubborn,” the wind corrected, and he found himself a boy again, grateful to be insulted precisely. “Good. Stubborn makes better bread than noble. Bread needs time more than it needs applause. That thing that is trying to live on first taste is tired of being chewed by the second. It will try new mouths. It will lay bowls in places where glass is lazy. It will ask to be invited like a cousin who didn’t bring dessert. Don’t feed him. Don’t put him out. Make him sit while eyes get used to water.”

Lucía wiped her hands on a rag, her mouth quiet because quiet was her courtesy when she didn’t yet know how to be rude kindly. “If he stops eating,” she said to the air, petitioning someone who wasn’t a god but had earned a portion of prayer, “will he be a man. Not this, not hunger wearing shoes.”

“He’ll be what he is under first bite,” said the field. “Some men are snakes around their hearts. Some are chairs. Some are handkerchiefs full of beans. He is a dent in the world that thinks it should be a mouth. Teach him to be dent. You practice already. You make a hollow for breath and call it name. Don’t let him steal the hollow.”

The window wavered as if the view had suffered an embarrassment. He wanted to ask the question he had brought in his pocket, folded, a second name with edges that might cut the wrong finger. He asked anyway, because asking was the only reason to be alive sometimes. “If I say the name you wrote on a paper in a room my mother still irons into silence, will I be calling the right thing. Or will I call a mistake that will arrive politely and ask to borrow salt.”

“You will call yourself with your hands,” she said, and Naya’s voice sat down beside hers as a second chair. “Mouths are for saying yes and no and sorry. Hands are for names. Make the shape of it. Shape isn’t the same as letters. Let the letters be a ring you wear so you remember you are married to something. Do not show the ring to anyone who isn’t your wife. You know better than to flash a ring in San Andresito.”

“Yes,” he said, because obedience felt like a relief while it stung. “How do I make the shape.”

“Wait until you want to eat the wrong thing and then keep your hands still for as many heartbeats as it takes to be a person who can leave a piece of mango on a plate,” she said dryly, and he laughed finally because the bodega of his life had always kept mango in stock. “Also, sew. Or knit. Or braid. Reckless boys braiding their names with wire think they invented prayer.”

“Reckless boys,” Lucía sniffed, pleased on his behalf and hers.

The window sighed all the way down Seventh. The guarín finished its work of announcing him and the day resumed its own plot. He poured tea into two cups and set one near the sill as if visiting relatives preferred heat. The coil’s ash looked like an old map of a country that had decided to become river. Lucía took her cup and breathed the steam as a person who had learned she owns lungs. He did not mention the man in her lamp. There are only so many absurdities you ask someone to share before you start building a city out of them.

He left not because he wanted to leave but because waiting can harden in a room and turn into a chair that never lets you stand. On the stairs he met a boy with a soccer ball who studied his ruana with professional disgust and asked if he was a wizard and if he could make the ball obey better than the boy’s own feet. He said he could make nothing obey that did not agree to be seduced first, which the boy liked and repeated twice before deciding the sentence wasn’t good luck and dropping it. The bakery’s owner, a woman whose earrings could slice bread, held up a loaf with a pilot’s certainty and Mateo bought it because it was one less decision to make alone.

Naya’s voice drew him toward Plaza de Mercado Siete de Agosto without being a call and without being not a call. He found her with three people breathing her direction as if that would make their medicines steep better. Val sat on a crate, hands gripping the edge of the seat as if they’d learned to ride buses that way, their hoodie offering declarations to whoever needed a slogan. Naya watched a pot as if it might fidget away.

“You smell like field and studio gossip,” she observed, and he nodded because accurate description is a kind of love. “Eat. You have that fasting arrogance in your eyebrows.”

He ate what she put in his hand, a half arepa whose edges burned his fingers into attention, a banana that thought it was a plantain and no one had corrected. Val showed him a feed on their phone of people laughing about the fish thief and then not laughing about the fish thief because a grandmother had told a story that made the comments careful. The comments always want an altar. Today they gave one.

“He was behind her,” Val said, the way a person says there is a stain that will not wash. “In your girlfriend’s lamp. Don’t argue with the word. It was a good word. He knows glass. He likes when pigment is shy. He will move to shiny wood next. He will start eating the idea of wood. He will start eating the gloss off everything. He will say this means he is a vegetarian and therefore good. We will slap his mouth.”

“I asked the wind for a favor,” Mateo said, because it was possible to be absurd in front of teenagers if you pronounced it correctly. “She told me to make my hands say my name. I don’t think she meant I should spell it with thread, but I think she will forgive me if I practice badly.”

“Practice badly in my house,” Val said, their contempt caring as a mother. “We can watch you and send a meme when you mess it up,” they added, generosity disguised as threat.

They went to Val’s because Val’s place had a table that had never agreed to be merely a table. It held solder burns and pencil grooves and a map of Bogotá traced into it by a cousin who had needed to pass a school exam and never did because maps are not a way to save yourself if Brazil is having a special. A cat acknowledged their arrival by moving one ear and keeping the rest of its body inviolate. On the wall was a drawing of a person whose shadow had feet independent of its life and looked as if it had decided to start a union.

“Okay,” Val said, sweeping a space bare that had been full of useful junk. “Make your hands say that. Don’t think about letters. Think about the shape your mother’s mouth makes when she says your name after you climbed over a fence you were told to respect and you cut your thumb but you didn’t tell anyone until the blood had dried into a sermon.”

He took wire because it was honest when it hurt you and because copper profile loved electricity and perhaps electricity remembered. He cut a length and tried to circle it and it fought, a stubborn snake that resented being asked to be anything but rope. He bent, and unbent, and the wire did not think in curves so much as in tantrums. Naya watched him with a lizard’s eye that blinked once every century. Val filmed him without announcing the fact, their phone a small impolite witness. When his first attempt looked like a question mark and his second like a fish that had decided to become a key and then regretted it, he laughed and the laugh rippled his hands into something they could do.

He breathed. He counted. He let his fingers remember needles and yarn, the clumsy joy of purling until the wool forgave him. The wire changed its mind because he had changed his. The loop in the middle had to be wide enough to let a voice through and tight enough to catch its coat when it tried to rush out. He made an opening like a mouth refused and then eased. The shape that emerged was not a letter. It was the difference between taking and receiving. It sat in his palm and watched him and he watched it back until it admitted being a little beautiful.

“Okay,” Val said, their scorn voting green. “That looks like something I would let into a party if it brought beer.”

“Do you think it can close a door without breaking it,” he asked Naya, who had her own wire in her hands and had made a coil that made this look like a child’s crown. “He said I have three days before it learns to be more bored and more cunning. I would like to make a door remember no.”

“It remembers,” she said, and put her coil up against his and made a little doorway in empty air and then took it away to prove the absence. “It’s been waiting for a person to be tiring to hunger. Most people feed it three polite times and then move to new neighborhoods. You’ll be boring longer. It will either leave you or learn a new song. He won’t learn the whole song. He’s too fond of the chorus.”

They worked until afternoon turned its face and showed the other cheek. He practiced standing with his mouth open and not swallowing anything his mouth could hold. Val hooted when he drooled and then apologized because humiliation is a cheap trick until it works and then it is a sin. Naya told a story about a man whose name had been given to a parrot, and how the parrot grew rich on the power of being answered, and how the man had to learn to only answer when the parrot asked him to take out the trash because that was how you make a marriage not die. The cat yawned and knocked a pen off the table to prove gravity still put in the hours. On the wall, the shadow drawing looked smug, which shadows love more than truth.

After he left Val’s, the city had washed its face. Water made doilies under tires and made saints out of oil. He walked with the cumbia of a man who has a weight in his pocket and doesn’t mind. He cut toward Las Aguas because he wanted to see the fountain fold itself and because the place where he had opened the door by accident had been nearby, inside the storm that had written the sky into sharp script. He found the corner without looking for it by turning where his feet were sure and his brain had time to be ashamed. The tree that had once been a goldfish when he blinked stood there, busy with ordinary leaves, and he wanted to forgive himself for having made it do something a tree did not want to do.

The crack in the city he had felt as a bruised nerve had softened. It lay on the sidewalk like a scar that had gotten the message and was stopped being a story. He took the wire name and set it against the seam that ran between two slabs of bad intention. He did not press hard. He did not own the concrete any more than he owned his breath. He held his hand above it and counted until the counting grew bored and he did not. A boy on a bicycle shouted the name of a player and a curse and a joke. The curse hit the wire and slid off. The joke stuck and he let it. You do not clean a name of joy. He kept his mouth open and tasted rain that didn’t fall. He closed his mouth and kept the taste. Somewhere in the high windows, a woman leaned on her elbows and watched him without wanting to be responsible for the outcome. He did not ask her to be.

He felt the hinge of the door that had yawned during the storm and been invited to stay. It was cold, the way metal is when it believes you are not your friend. He did what he had practiced badly in Val’s kitchen. He made a shape in the air and asked the hinge to find it familiar. He said no with a voice that wasn’t angry and wasn’t eager; it was middle-aged and done with the errand. Deep in the concrete there was the click he had expected and the silence that was better. He stood for the extra seconds good endings require and then walked away, because lingering teaches doors mischief.

The man in the gray suit was nowhere. That was worse than if he had been everywhere. Instead, an old woman with hair tired of dye regarded him from a bus stop and shook her head as if he were the worst kind of nephew. “You’re young to be making such complicated faces,” she said, a god handing a compliment disguised as a slap. “Go home and take a nap. Do not ask the nap to be noble. Just ask it to be stupid and efficient.” He said gracias and meant it and would have bought whatever she sold if she had sold a thing.

He stopped by a pet store that pretended to be an apothecary for fish and bought food by calculating days backward and adding a small lie. He fed the two fish at home exactly what he had decided in the market and then counted to a number that made their mouths less interesting to his hunger. He turned on the radio and found a program that pretended to be about sports but was actually about the ways men practice calling each other dear without using any of those syllables. He let their idiocy hold his house for a while.

When the knock came, it was an old knock, the kind that remembers you were a child. He opened to find his neighbor with the saint bracelets, dog leashed and imploring the hallway for seduction. The woman looked at his face, then at his bowl, then at his mirror, without apology.

“Do you require a casserole,” she asked, which in the dialect of women with bracelets and dogs meant Is the problem something that can be helped by fat and onion. “Also I have an aunt who knows a man who knows a priest who will say a prayer if you bring him a bottle. No receipts.”

“I need to learn to say no to a bowl,” he said, because jokes got to the heart faster and made fewer scars. “And I am not good at priests. The dog is beautiful.”

“She is,” the woman said, and the dog turned her head to claim universal agreement. “I am baking. I will make enough for two. Do you like raisins. If you say yes, we will not be friends.”

He chose friendship and returned to his apartment feeling wealthier for simple transactions in which no one asked anyone for anything they couldn’t survive without. In the mirror, his face looked tired and human. In the bowl, two fish arranged themselves into a shape that meant peace, or resignation, or simply fish. He texted Lucía a picture of the wire shape he had made and she responded with a crown and a picture of a loaf with a bite missing and a message that said this is me not eating the second slice. He sent back the wind emoji and then regretted the stupidity and then let it be because some sillinesses can live without supervision.

Night came with the habitual pomp of a city that does not believe in night but is tired of arguing. The jacaranda made a shadow on his wall with elbows. He lay on the couch with the ruana over him and kept his hands folded on his stomach like an old man pretending to be dead to frightening children. He did not sleep quickly; he refused the trick of forcing; he let sleep be the guest that arrives while you tell a story too long; he let himself be bored into rest. When the dream came, it was a teaching sort, which are the worst kind for entertainment and the best kind for surviving.

He was looking down at a table with a glass top. Someone he trusted sat across from him knitting with wire, which was a fool’s errand and also could be done if patience wore boots. The door to the room he did not recognize opened and the smell of an aquarium entered wearing Levi’s and perfume that had not been fashionable for years. The man who stepped in was ordinary, with a pocket that held a bowl the way some men hold cigarettes and forget to smoke them until hunger stands on the nearest chair and claps. The man didn’t speak. Mateo did. He said his own name and it sat between them like a mountain pretending to be bread. The man reached for it and found nothing, and for a second his face did a human thing again, not the failing to keep an expression, but the keeping of one—disappointment edged with the absurd relief of not being fed.

He woke because waking is what cities ask of you in exchange for so much light. The radio had crawled into music and was playing a song that tried to be rude and ended up with a chorus you could hum in a grocery store without feeling like you were confessing a crime. He smiled, then didn’t. There was a figure in his mirror, not him, not exactly, wearing his ruana wrong and standing too still. The fish in the reflection were two and then three and then two again as if someone had been distracted from mischief by a knock at a different door. He kept his mouth shut and his hands easy. The figure in the mirror had a bowl in their pocket and then didn’t, and the not-having it looked like grief.

He spoke without moving his lips because he wanted to see if he could keep his mouth for unnecessary uses. “Sit,” he said, to the hunger and to himself. “We will do this without anyone getting what they have taught themselves to want.”

The figure did not sit; that would have been too sweet an obedience. It stood against the glass as a person stands at a bus stop after a day of asking for yes from doors. The man in the gray suit did not appear, which meant he was listening. And because he chose to pretend the absence of suits was a kindness he deserved, he went to the kitchen and turned the kettle on and stood in front of it until the steam took shape and then collapsed. He poured water into a mug for the sake of sound. He let the hunger hear water it could not have, because he was mean today in a way that felt honest.

He fell back asleep in a patch of the couch that felt like it had been made for him by someone with a tape measure. He dreamed Ana Guarín borrowing his shoes and returning them with river in the soles. He dreamed the man in the gray suit looking up at the mountain and asking it for a raise. He dreamed Val cheating on a math test by turning off the school’s Wi-Fi with a coin taped to the router. He dreamed the bowl, and the door, and the moment when you teach your hands what refrain means and why songs need it. When he woke, the light through the jacaranda had changed color like a bruise learning to be a story someone else would tell.

At mid-morning, the third new trick arrived dressed like a toy. A man on a bicycle stopped at the curb and opened a box and released three small drones that looked like fish with bad ideas. They whirred into the air and children cheered because machines acting like animals had been a religion before and could be again. The drones flickered iridescent and mirrored everything badly, like cheap makeup. He watched one lift above the bowl on his table and, in the drone’s camera lens, he saw the bowl doubled into a door he did not own. He took the wire shape, placed it on the rim of his bowl, and the drone’s mirror hiccuped and turned its eye away the way a neighbor turns off a radio when your favorite song comes on. The boy piloting it looked at his screen and frowned and announced to no one that interference was rude. Mateo opened the window and held up a coin. The drone tried to love the coin more than the bowl and succeeded because metal and attention have always owned machinery.

He texted Naya what had happened and she answered with an emoji he had never seen, a snail wearing a crown, which he took to mean Go slowly like someone ruling their own speed. He texted Val and received a photograph of a sticker that said YOU ARE NOT THE AUDIENCE and an address. He put on his shoes and did not bring the coil because he had decided to spend his seeing already and he didn’t want the day to feel owed more.

The address was a building that had forgotten what business it had been licensed for. The front room had become a classroom for women who knew how to wrap their heads against sun and wanted to learn the current language of bureaucracy. The back room was full of glass a man named Eduardo had decided the city did not deserve. He made bowls and windows and lenses and the kind of bottle that makes vinegar taste like ambition. His beard was a policy decision. He wore a shirt that had a stain that could have been a country. He had apparently been told to expect a hinge.

“I don’t make weapons,” he said, which is what men say before they make something that will be used to break a thing with dignity. “I make containers. Containment is a kind of war, but it is also a kind of love. What needs to be contained.”

“An idea that is bad at endings,” Mateo said, incapable of courting a lie properly. “It has learned to move through glass. If I can give it a bowl that has the right kind of edge, maybe it will prefer the bowl. Maybe it will wait there like an obedient thought. Maybe we can teach it something else while it waits.”

Eduardo smiled like a magician caught at the moment between pockets. “Then you want a lip that refuses to be a shore. You want glass that asks for permission before it lets a thing climb over. I can make that. It will take longer than you want. It will not be as beautiful as you lie to your friends it is. But it will work until we lose it. We lose everything, hijo. We just decide how interesting the story is on the way.”

He blew and turned and the molten obedient thing on the end of his pipe became less obedient with every breath. He whispered to it in a way that would have made a priest jealous if priests believed in glass. Mateo watched and thought of lungs and whether they were honest. Val filmed again because their memory preferred witnesses with pixels. Naya, who had insisted on coming and who had insisted also on buying a small bottle of vinegar to clean her swear words, put the guarín on the windowsill because smoke and heat speak better than one of them alone. The smell of August argued with the smell of burning sand. The bowl on the pipe decided to be itself and then, more importantly, decided to remain.

A lip that asked for permission took shape. Eduardo cooled it and warmed it and lied to it with breathing until it elected to lie back. When he set it in the rack to sleep, their hunger all sat up at once and asked how long, and he told them truth and it was the worst taste in the room. They would come back tomorrow. He asked for nothing in advance because he liked to make a thing and then decide what it had been worth. That was his religion. He refused payment with a generous mouth that probably had a bookkeeper for a wife who liked him less for it and loved him more.

On the way out, the women in the front room were learning the difference between a signature and a mark and one of them had a baby asleep like a slack god in her lap. The baby’s mouth did that dream suck and a woman not its mother felt her milk drop and laughed and made a rude sign at her own body. Mateo wanted to put his wire name on the child’s forehead like a blessing and then knew better and kept his hands.

He went to the aqueduct not because anyone told him to but because water had begun to believe his silence was conversation and he didn’t want to be rude. The man at the gate raised his eyebrows into heaven’s backyard and asked for a note, and Mateo gave him one he didn’t have, which the man had expected and let pass because writing is also a gesture and not only a proof. The water plant wore its bones. Pipes like thighs and valves like knees. A reservoir that did not care about any metaphor for it and insulted poets with its existence. He stood near a vent and watched the city’s drink get organized. He thought of the man that was his hunger and had lettered his mouth with rules. He wondered what a river thinks of a bowl. He wondered if he was a bowl and who had been arrogant enough to become a river in his direction.

He did not see Ana but the air did that thing where it forgets it stops at skin. A worker with a tattoo of a bird that had been drawn by someone who loved the bird and hated the man asked him whether he was lost. He said no and the worker said good and pointed at a bench with a covenant with shade. He sat on it and pretended to be a man who didn’t recognize his own reflection in a metal panel. The reflection did not try to add a fish. The reflection tried to be humble, which made him suspicious of it. He stayed until the bench made the back of his thighs disbelieve comfort, and then left, counting because counting makes leaving obedient.

At dusk the city struck a match for the benefit of those who insisted lamplight is an emotion. He went to Lucía’s with the loaf from morning reborn as an excuse. The smell of guarín had gone home. The lamp did not wink. The paper fish hung in a sentence that didn’t end and his mind wanted to correct it. He cut bread while she stirred something that made a soft shhh sound in the pot that made he and she say nothing that could not be whispered. She told him about the children who had made saints out of bad paper and told the saints to mind their hands. He told her about the glass bowl that would refuse to be used like a door. They did not say the words we are worried. They said adjectives and let the nouns take the hint.

She took his face in her paint-fingered hands and said, “I will put a packet of sugar in my pocket the next time I ride the cable up. Not for me. For the woman who wants to love sugar with all her teeth. And I will make a lamp to watch your mouth. It will not tell on you. It will only watch.”

“You don’t have to be in this,” he said, which was as thin a lie as he had ever told, because of course she did because he loved her as much as he was able to, and love recruits people into each other’s wars. “You can just sell saints.”

“I am a saint,” she said, insulted. “Never of the thing anyone wants. I am the saint of little knots that keep underwear from escaping. I am the saint of children who can’t remember their own names when the teacher calls them because they already walked out of the room in their heads toward the mountain. We do what we can.”

He slept there with the studio’s air like a spouse and the paper fish cracking their paper spines with each draft. He woke in the night because someone outside insisted on a song in a key no human throat should insist on. He woke also because the mirror in the corner had simply decided to be a lake. He did not sit up. He held the wire shape gently in his hands where he had learned it could do less damage. In the glass, the man who might be him approached and stopped at the exact place where a door would be if the studio had been designed for questions rather than paint.

“Sit,” he whispered, not unkindly. The man did not sit, but he did not move. He breathed once like someone trying it out.

Morning came with a voice that had bartered for an egg and lost and now would pretend not to want eggs. They ate quickly because leaving is easier when you feed it pretext. He went to Eduardo’s to find the bowl asleep in its new reality, still changing temper in a way only glass is honest enough to do. Eduardo picked it up with gloves that had known better days and tapped a fingernail against the lip. The sound was not a note so much as a decision.

“I lied,” he said, and there was joy in it. “It is beautiful in the way a scar is. If you do not drop it, it will make a window embarrassed when it tries to be a door. Take it. Pay me by letting me watch you stop something from behaving badly.”

He took it, the weight exactly untrustworthy, and loved it because it had asked for permission to have a lip. He carried it through a city that pretended not to notice men carrying bowls the way it pretends not to notice grief in the grocery aisle. Naya met him without announcement at the corner where the storm had once taught him a handwriting lesson and the guarín he had burned the day before lifted its hand and said present before any roll call had been called. Val arrived on a skateboard and was almost run over by a man who mistook impatience for urgency. They took places like people at a wake taking places around a pastry tray.

They did not call the hunger. It came because places remember and because it had learned to love glass. It sniffed at the bowl with a dog’s offense at a hand made into a fist. It circled himself around the lip without finding the opening because the opening insisted on consent. It tried to become the right question mark. It failed. Mateo waited until failing had exhausted it and then had the audacity to speak.

“You can use this,” he said. “You can put your mouth against this and practice wanting without taking. You can look and let looking be enough. You can live. You are allowed to live if you decide not to be just a habit.”

The not-man almost laughed in that way that had always felt like a man laughs when he wants to make your kindness into your own insult. Then the almost became a cracking and he was simply a person. It exhausted him. He put his bowl into his pocket and put his hand, instead, into his mouth the way a child does when it has been told the word no again and again and needs to comfort itself with the truth that hands exist. Mateo put the new bowl down on the pavement like an altar. The hunger stepped toward it and did not touch it and that was something. It would have to be.

They let the hour pass them. A bus’s exhale became their metronome. The mountain had its head in the clouds and the clouds acted like hats and made the city look ridiculous in a way she enjoyed. The jacarandas bothered bees into honest work. A saint fell from a vendor’s table and did not break, which made three men cross themselves without remembering they had left that trick in childhood. A boy on a bicycle learned to turn without falling and cursed triumphantly in a way only boys are allowed. The hunger stood and did not eat. Mateo stood and did not feed. The bowl did not fail, because it had asked to be allowed to help and it had been allowed.

Later, the man in the gray suit walked by stirring sugar into a coffee with a spoon he did not intend to put into his mouth. He regarded the bowl as if it were a woman he could convince to change grocery stores. He regarded Mateo as if he had missed a deadline and was going to start missing others, which in his religion was the same as praying. He tipped his chin in a acknowledge me that Mateo did not grant.

“You have two days,” the man said, rectifying his lie. “You are wasting one being beautiful. Get uglier. Ugliness closes doors.”

Naya took out her bottle of vinegar and dabbed her throat with it as if it were perfume and as if she had never knowingly permitted someone to insult her. “Go schedule a sunset,” she told him. “Leave the rest of us daylight.”

He smiled as if he had been fed, which made Mateo want to starve him so thoroughly he would have to learn to chew. The man left, his shadow pointing correctly, a worse insult than any angle could be. Val flipped him off with such artistry that even the saints in their plastic sleeves did not mind. The bowl sat on the ground being good. The two fish at home opened and closed their mouths according to their clock, and in the mirror, for the first time in days, there stayed two and only two.

When he went home, he set the new bowl on the table beside the old bowl and the smell of glass’s cool receded into the room’s ordinary. He wrote the other name on a scrap again and did not cross it out. He threaded the wire shape through the new bowl’s lip, not to lock it, but to remind it they were friends. The city sighed and made room for a man who was learning to be boring and a bowl that was learning to be a law and a hunger that might learn to become a person if someone showed it how to sit down without expecting to be fed immediately. He stood and felt ridiculous again and felt exactly right, and the balance of that stole his breath briefly and gave it back, which is how you know a thing wants you to live.Chapter 7

By noon the city had decided to forgive the morning for being ordinary, and in that forgiveness Mateo found a thin kind of courage that could be folded and put into his pocket with the wire shape. He moved through Teusaquillo with the new bowl wrapped in a towel that had once belonged to his mother, and it felt like carrying a sleeping animal that trusted him without cause. On the corner a man arranged plastic grapes into pyramids that would not survive wind, and he nodded at the bundle as if to say he saw the weight of it even if he pretended it was bread. Mateo wanted to tell everyone he passed that glass could learn consent if asked kindly, and then he wanted to admit that he was projecting, because people do that when they have learned a trick and are afraid it will forget them. He reached his building door counting the bolts without touching them and opened it with a palm that still smelled like guarín, then set the bowl on the table and watched his two fish turn into punctuation around it.

The rumor of a vigil reached him before anyone had planned it. Two vendors at Siete de Agosto had decided to keep bowls half full of clean water on their tables and change the water every hour, not to tempt the thief but to make their stalls into places where water could become tired of showing off. Naya passed this to him like a postcard with a joke on the back, and Val, who had nothing like patience for the respectable tempo of adult decisions, sent a message threaded with photographs of bowls in windows, bowls on steps, bowls in the laps of women who fed pigeons and had decided to feed glass instead. It was both ridiculous and serious in a way that made Mateo trust it, because in this city the useless and the necessary often wore the same jacket. He lifted the new bowl to the light and tapped his fingernail against its permission lip, and the sound it made did not carry, which was its beauty. It drew attention by refusing to.

He went to see Eduardo with bread and no money, and Eduardo made the face of a man who knows the value of his work and still enjoys being lied to with gratitude. The glassmaker had already started on a second bowl, less perfect than the first and proud of it, because perfection would have been impolite in a town whose sidewalks kept changing their minds. “You told me a story and I decided to believe it,” Eduardo said, wiping his hands on a rag that used to be a shirt and now looked like a map of a country where heat had been president for too long. “I am not your ally, hijo. I am your accomplice. That pays worse and tastes better.” Mateo promised him nothing in return but attendance, and Eduardo nodded, as if being seen was a currency he was tired of being denied.

The man in the gray suit was not on any corner and not behind any glass and not holding any sugar this time, which made Mateo’s scalp prickle as if something had moved against the hair there without the courtesy of a breeze. Absence is not kindness; sometimes it is a hunt. Lucía texted him two photographs that pretended to be about paint: one of a saint with a yellow halo and a green mouth because she had tried to mix her colors with a dirty brush and had decided against fixing it, and one of a table leg she had sanded smooth where a splinter had punished her ankle. Behind the saint’s glass, he saw nothing unusual, and behind the table’s gloss, he saw his own reflection arrange itself to be polite. He told her he would bring almíbar later if it rained, which was a sentence that said nothing urgent and everything true.

By midafternoon the gloss began to go missing from places where gloss had never volunteered. Coffee that should have slicked the lip of a cup refused shine. Soup put down its oil like a tired shawl and walked away. The lampposts that had learned the habit of catching whatever light the day had left stopped flirting. A man buffed his taxi with an old t-shirt and frowned because the car looked newly honest when he wanted it to look eager. Mateo felt it in his mouth, the way a word loses sugar and reveals its bone. This was one of the tricks the hunger had promised to learn, or rather had not promised because it didn’t make promises, it made intentions look like weather. He called Naya without dialing because some calls use a street corner and a plant and the old chorus of vendors, and when he turned, she was there, carrying a bag that clinked like jars praying.

“We’ll leave bowls where the city used to look at itself and liked what it saw,” she said, and he heard the river in the instruction, not because the river said it but because the river had always been tired of being memory and wanted to be present. “We’ll not set traps, because traps make liars of what gets caught. We’ll make rooms inside the air. And while we do it, you will practice being boring in public. The handsome fail at it. Pray you are only handsome when you sleep.”

Lucía walked up with her crown tucked into her back pocket for later and two paper cups that burned her fingers more gently than they burned his. She kissed the corner of Naya’s mouth, because she kissed people where their kisses would do the most good, and said she had seen the gloss go off her brushes and had been relieved. “Let the truth be matte,” she said, blowing across foam she had not paid extra for. “This week I want the city to look like it remembers it is not a product. Also I brought string, because if we don’t tie things to each other I get depressed.” They moved together like a trio that had rehearsed only once and already had critics.

Plaza de Lourdes took the first bowl because it had always liked to see itself dressed. They set it on the stone lip at the base of a statue that had lost its nose and gained a toucan sticker that no one had dared remove. The permission lip faced the street and refused entry with the kindness of a doorman who remembers an old debt. People came near and either scoffed or slowed; the scoffers were loud with their ankles and kept shopping, and the ones who slowed put small coins at the base without meaning to, as if old habits of offering lived in their pockets like lint. “If any of you takes the bowl we will know it because the gloss will come back to your hair, and we will follow the shine to your door and make a fuss,” Lucía told two boys eyeing the glass with their laundry list faces, and then made them laugh with a vulgarity that shook their respect loose and left their fear intact.

They walked bowls into corners where mirrors had once been and now the wall pretended it had never known them. They set bowls on the steps of a church and at the mouth of an alley where cats had organized their politics according to the hour before dawn. Val met them at San Victorino with a skateboard under one foot and a string of small bells that would ring if a wind that had not been invited examined one place too closely. “He’s in love with his own shadow today,” Val said, showing them a video of their own reflection refusing to keep up with their hand. “It’s boring. I’m bored. That means he is trying to become interesting. Don’t let him. If he becomes interesting we’re doomed.”

In a café they took a table that had known cards and fists and put the bowl squarely in the sun-stripe. The waitress with weary hair asked if this was a party and did they need plates, and when Lucía said yes to the first and no to the second, the waitress nodded because that was the order of things in a city where ceremonies cost less than dessert. The bowl sat, the lip made no proclamation and all the proclamation it needed to make, and a person passing by with a pair of shoes in a plastic bag stopped and asked politely if the shoes looked as good as they had on the sidewalk and now they did not. “It will be unfashionable to glow for a while,” Naya told them, and the person said that was fine because their cousin glowed and it had never helped him find work.

By evening the vigil had become obvious enough that the man in the gray suit could no longer pretend not to notice. He appeared beside a bowl on the steps of the Planetarium reading a program as if he had paid for it and learned a secret that the rest of the city was too married to its errands to understand. He smiled like a man who approved of children when they were quiet and asked if Mateo felt heroic yet. Mateo told him he felt unwashed, and the man nodded as if that was a punchline they had rehearsed together. “Gloss was the only thing holding your people together,” the man said, stirring his coffee with a spoon he still refused to taste. “You will learn that matte is only adorable for a weekend. After that, you will beg for shine back, and you will pay any price a mouth asks.”

“We have vinegar,” Naya said, dabbing her wrists with it again because the suit’s cologne smelled like an apology written by someone else. “We have bread. We have a child who knows how to turn off a router with a coin. We have a mountain with nothing to do but listen. And we have a hinge that refuses to squeak when you want him to.” The man tipped the spoon toward Mateo like he was knighting him and walked away humming a tune that television used when a game show had run too long. He left his shadow behind only for a second, and the shadow caught itself in the bowl’s lip and hissed like a cat unloved by a door.

In Lucía’s studio the lamp chose to behave, which was how Mateo knew the hunger had gotten bored with glass in small rooms and would be moving to larger, more public surfaces. He and Lucía cooked something without a recipe and made it edible by counting aloud, which was as much a prayer as anything else they had in their pantry. When he slept on her couch the mirror did not try to add a third fish, and he woke briefly happy, which he did not trust and decided to savor anyway because sometimes distrust ruins the food. He walked home in dawn that had been undercooked by the night and found his neighbor’s dog asleep outside his door with a casserole cooling on the floor beside her; the woman with the bracelets had taped a note to it that said no raisins and a drawing of a saint that looked like a very serious potato. He ate too much and loved the diabetes and left the dish washed on her mat with a sprig of yerbabuena tied to the handle like ribbon.

The second day smelled like schooling. Eduardo delivered a second bowl and a third that had cracked while cooling and still wanted to serve and would have to be taught to be happy as a plate. People had started to bring their own glass bragging about its temper, and he had to be kind and refuse because only certain lips knew the shape of no as a hospitality. The city did half the work without direction; someone set a bowl in the window of the small aquarium store near Parque España and the woman named Vela-or-Vélez who had once made everyone laugh on the news day looked at the bowl as if it had been a new kind of fish she had been waiting for and had forgotten she had. Across town buses wore bowls on the dash beside the saints like silly hats, and the drivers laughed and then did not laugh because the bowls insisted on being taken seriously no matter how much plastic glitter the saints were dripping.

It was at midday that hunger took a risk like a teenager. The Bogotá River had never promised anyone beauty, but for one hour it put down oil and picked up a mirror’s job. The rumor came in a voice that had learned to talk over the market and arrived with a crowd because everyone knew where to stand for the wrong miracle. Mateo found it not by map but by the way sound changes when water thinks it is a screen. The surface was still without being quiet, the way a throat closes in an argument. They saw him before he saw himself: the not-man at the far bank where the trees had decided to live out their angry years. He held no coat because he wore rain. He held no bowl because his pocket was a lie. He bent, and the surface behaved the way surfaces behave around men who say please without an appetite for the answer.

Mateo stood with Naya and Val and a half circle of curiosity and fear and saints around the bowl Eduardo had made for this and not for this. The permission lip looked ridiculous near a river that had never understood permission unless it came as concrete clenched against its sides. He stepped into the shallows because the mosaic fish in the municipal pool had trained his feet for cold and because standing back felt like an insult to a conversation he had started. The not-man looked up with his borrowed face and smiled not in malice but in success, which made the malice worse. He would drink a first sip of river and teach the body of the city to stop believing in endings.

“Call him by the shape,” Naya said, her hand steady at his elbow without touching because touching sometimes pulls a person back when they have chosen a ledge for a reason. “You have hands. Use them. No mouth today unless it is to say what you have already learned to say without wanting to be applauded for it.” Val stood with a bottle of vinegar in one hand and a slingshot in the other and announced to the crowd that if anyone tried to film, they should at least get his good side, and someone said he didn’t have one, and the laughter made space in the air where fear had been sitting with its knees up.

He raised his hands and made the wire shape without wire. At first his fingers were blunt as chalk and then the old learning returned, the knitting, the braid, the little habits a boy learns when he is taught to keep his fingers busy so his mind does not fall into wells. He made the loop that allowed light to pass and the bar that asked for consent and the curve that offered, not demanded. He held it over the bowl, and then beyond the bowl, and then over the place on the river’s surface where a mistake had decided to go fishing. The not-man paused, not because he had obeyed but because a habit was being denied at the exact right time and denial shocked him more than shouting could have done. “No,” Mateo said, low and uninteresting, and then kept his mouth out of it and repeated the shape with his hands until they learned to do it without his permission.

He felt the old door hinge under his collar bone and the click he had found in concrete, except this was a hinge made of breath against weather and would require him to be humbler than he had practiced. The river made a face he had never seen it make, which was the face of someone postponing a kiss. The lip of the bowl did not amplify or scold; it stayed there being itself until there was nowhere for the first sip to go that did not shame the mouth that wanted it. The not-man straightened, which was a victory, and in doing so admitted he wore a back and a spine and the old debt to gravity that men fall behind on when they pretend they are better than bones. “You are making rules,” he said, and the voice rode water as if he had hired it. “Rules tickle. I will itch until night and then scratch.”

“You will practice starving,” Mateo answered, not as a teacher but as a man who had once been told no by a plant and had liked the discipline. “You will practice being alive without calling that bite eternal. You will become heavy. You will discover a chair. We will give you a chair if you promise not to eat it.” People in the crowd snorted in the way of people who have lived too long next to government and recognize a negotiation in any weather, and somebody shouted siéntese entonces and someone else added with a kindness that sounded like mockery that it was a nice day for sitting.

The not-man’s face failed again and then kept an expression that was not beautiful and was not interesting and was therefore promising. He stepped back from the river’s vanity and left it with its old job of holding birds and garbage and sky and a little girl's paper boat, and the sky returned to blocking out television for children whose mothers did not want them to be advertised to by clouds. The crowd did the thing all crowds do when the miracle fails to produce fireworks; it broke into small churches of opinion, and those churches went to buy empanadas. Naya added a pinch of salt to the bowl and then scolded herself for superstition, and Val took a photograph of the river looking ugly and posted it with a heart, which is how you tell a city you’re on her side when she is not giving you her best angle.

Word sneaked ahead of them the way smoke gets into clothes without setting off the alarm, and by the time they returned to the market they found a woman with hair dyed a red that refused to correspond to any fruit announcing to anyone who would accept a compliment and a scolding at once that she had known from the beginning the thief was a saint and a dog at once. The old man with the aquarium gravel for sale shook a small bag of stones like a dull maraca and asked Mateo, without irony, if he planned to organize a schedule for the bowls like a bus route so they could be expecting him, because being surprised made his heart do a thing it had been warned not to. Mateo told him the bowl would be where permission needed to be practiced, and the man patted his cheek with eyes as soft as worn socks and said that was the worst answer he had ever enjoyed.

That evening he sat with Lucía and Naya and Val and the two fish at his table, and the bowl sat between them like an older cousin that everyone felt protective of and a little irritated by. They ate bread that had decided to rise anyway because flour remembers better than mouths do, and they took turns telling the day to each other as if none of them had been there and would never be there again. Lucía said the mountain had spoken to her the way a baker speaks to flour, which is to say with exasperated tenderness, and had told her to make a painting that did not show light but made a shadow more than it had a right to be, and she had and it had offended her and she had kept it anyway. Val confessed to turning off three routers that did not belong to them because the comments had gotten rude, and then confessed to turning them back on because ignorant people have a right to their shouting, and Naya told them a piece of gossip about a priest who had apologized to the wind because he had mistaken it for a god and the wind had refused to forgive him until he washed his hands.

When the knock came, they did not jump, because they had been practicing not jumping for two days and this was a chance to learn whether the practice had done anything a body could spend later. It was the neighbor with the bracelets and the dog that loved everyone in the hall equally, and she brought a pie negligent of crust and generous with filling, and told Naya that the smell of the coil had gotten into the pillowcases and that if the smell was called by a name in her grandmother’s village would someone please tell her that name before she made one up and embarrassed herself in front of the ancestors. Naya said guarín and the woman repeated it four times and decided to say it as if she had invented it, which is how a word makes a home. Everyone ate more and forgave themselves for being animals, and when the neighbor left her bracelets had learned the rhythm of the room and stood against the dog’s sigh.

Sleep came with strings on it, and he let it drag him a little because resisting everything is a religion that will not keep your teeth. In the night he dreamed a library where the books had been replaced by bowls of different lips, and people came with their hunger and checked out permission for two weeks with the option to renew. The librarian was Ana and she had rope-braid hair and she told him his late fees were due in hands not coin, and when he tried to apologize she made him practice instead, which was her love as much as her meanness. He woke with a mouth full of a name he did not say, and he used his hands to speak it into the air as if he was kneading sound, and the air behaved as if it understood enough not to make a scene.

On the third morning, which the man in the gray suit had insisted would be the one that demanded a new trick or punished the absence of one, the city opened its windows faster, as if anticipating something, and then laughed at itself because anticipation is a vanity. The gloss had learned humility and then boredom, and it was returning in small patches that seemed to choose the heads of people who had behaved well at lines, which delighted Mateo because he loved petty miracles. The bowls remained, and the permission lips refused or allowed as a chair refuses or allows, and Eduardo brought a fourth and a fifth and said that if anyone tried to pay him he would be offended on behalf of the glass because it did not enjoy money’s bad breath. People had started to greet the bowls the way they greet saints at parades, with two fingers and a quiet show of sincerity, which almost made the bowls blush and made Mateo declare without a vote that blushing bowls were to be discouraged.

He expected the suit to arrive wearing a threat folded into a compliment, and when the man did appear he did not speak right away. He stood very close to the bowl on Mateo’s table and watched the fish as if he were ready to learn their names in order to misuse them. Then he smiled and said, almost kindly, that boredom is harder to keep than hunger. “You will tire of refusing a little before he tires of wanting,” he said, and Mateo understood this as both prediction and weapon. “It would be best to fail soon so that you can stop insisting on a virtue that does not suit you.”

“The only virtue I own is counting,” Mateo said, not looking him in the mouth because mouths are traps that think they are doors. “And the ability to sew a small mistake until it becomes a useful scar. I don’t care if those virtues suit me. I wasn’t fitted for them. I inherited them from women who never asked to be seen and were and made do.” The suit’s eyes flickered because there was nothing to grip there, and perhaps because a man who believes virtue is a wardrobe finds it irritating when someone opts for a uniform.

“Then let’s count together,” the man said, and he lifted three fingers, then two, then none, and the room went momentarily thin as a trick. Shadows shifted, not like people but like habits, and for a second the mirror thought about generosity. Lucía said an ugly word that made the saints on her phone’s case avert their hologram gaze, and Val, who had appeared in the door without knocking because knocking was not their genre, threw a coin at the gray suit’s foot. The coin balanced on its edge, as if refusing to agree with gravity out of spite, and then fell, heads up, as if obeying a rule. The man smiled because he loved a good rule when it could be weaponized, and then he stepped back as if he had tripped over a small girl’s patience.

They went to the place where the crack in the city had first promised to be a door, because the suit was right about one thing: endings dislike repetition, and you close a story sometimes by finding the beginning and refusing to imitate it. The jacaranda had finally decided to let go of color it had been hoarding, and the ground under it looked like a carpet nobody vacuumed because they were sentimental about footprints. He laid the wire name in his palm and made the shape above it with the other hand until he could feel both as one, which was embarrassing and true. The permission lip of the bowl faced the seam between slabs, and for a long minute nothing happened because nothing passing for nothing happened every day in this city and preferred not to be singled out for attention.

He did not say the second name aloud because he did not have the right or the need. He said his own with his hands until the air around his wrists learned the apostrophe of it, and then he lowered his hands and put them in his pockets like a man who had lost his keys. He waited. He counted. He felt the old hinge under the concrete argue with the new one under his ribs, and he asked them to find each other the way two people find each other under a stuttering streetlight because they were told to by weather. The click, when it came, was both loud and small; it could have been a bottle cap, or a pistol, or a child deciding against a lie. He looked at the suit, and the suit looked at him, and for one second the man’s shadow pointed toward daybreak and then corrected itself out of pride.

“You will get uglier,” the man said, gracious and absent already because absence was his home. “Practicing no makes faces mean. I will visit when your beauty has become insufficient to distract people from your meanness. I love men best then.” He left with a step too neat for someone who claimed to love the mess of appetite, and Naya picked up the wire name and kissed it without sentiment and placed it back in Mateo’s palm as if to say that hands who hold a thing should be seen holding a thing so they do not pretend it happened in a dream.

For a while, the day insisted on being a day and not a lesson. Lucía sold one painting for less than it deserved because the woman who wanted it listened properly when she talked about light, and Val managed to not be suspended from anything for an entire afternoon which they announced as a triumph, and Eduardo confessed the fourth bowl had a bubble that made him love it too much to give away and they had to argue him into letting the city borrow it. The neighbor brought coffee that had remembered its gloss and told them her dog had learned to sleep in the exact patch of sun that moved across the hallway and she had adjusted her errands to watch this phenomenon as if it were television. The fish opened and closed their mouths in the bowl and in the mirror, two and two, until the number itself got bored and returned to being what it was: a number, not a promise.

Night decided to be theatrical after all, perhaps out of spite because the day had refused. Clouds arranged themselves like a choir and remembered a song no one had requested. Mateo stood at the window and counted the seconds between what he saw and what he heard until the pattern felt like a body he could rest his head on. When the first hard rain came, the jacaranda did less than expected and more than required, which would be a good epitaph for any tree. He smelled metal without fear because he had learned which kind of metal wanted to be bitten and which kind wanted to bite back. He placed the bowl on the floor because there are times you ask sacred things to act like household objects, and you treat them better if you put them at your feet.

He dreamed no heroics, which might have been the best gift. He dreamed of his mother sitting with Ana, both of them young and mean and kind in the way you are when you refuse to forgive a world that forgives itself too easily. He dreamed that they braided his name into his hair and then cut it and put it in a jar and told the jar to behave, and it did. He dreamed of Eduardo’s bowls lined on a shelf in a museum that refused to be a museum because museums in this city always want to be parties, and of people reaching out without touching, and of the security guard who did not tell them to stop because he had learned a rule more useful than the one posted on the wall. He dreamed of the man in the gray suit sitting in a chair that creaked like a confession, and of hunger tired out like a toddler stripped of sugar, and of the mountain in the distance listening so hard she forgot to rain.

When he woke, the word he did not say did not choke him. He carried it to the kitchen and set it down beside the vinegar and the yerbabuena and the bread crumbs and let it be among those ingredients that make unremarkable mornings. He thought of a door and decided not to open it and counted himself brave for such a small refusal. He sent Lucía a message that said only pan? and she answered with a picture of her lamp again, still lit, still cracked, still a pear that refused to rot, and in the reflection he saw himself normal and his hunger bored, and he laughed aloud because boredom, properly cared for, can be a miracle you do not have to pay for.

The city went to work pretending not to notice itself being saved from a story, which is a courtesy people rarely extend to heroes in other places, and he forced himself to sit and eat and wait. He would be asked something else soon and he would have to decide which of his two names had the right to answer. Until then he would practice. He would hang bowls where doors thought they could learn new tricks. He would fail to be interesting. He would count twelve and four and two and pretend not to be in love with breath. He would knock on no door with his mouth that his hands had not first made credible. He would stand at the window and watch the purple that had been too proud give the sidewalk back to feet, and he would be grateful to a city that lets men be hinges without asking them to be locks.Chapter 9

The first sign that hunger had stopped courting glass and started listening to sound was small and comic enough that the city didn’t notice. It happened in kitchens and buses and barbershops: the radios began to swallow beginnings. A bolero would open its mouth and not find the first syllable; the announcer on a fútbol station would inhale for gol and stop at go, the word hiccuping near the lips of a thousand men who prided themselves on finishing. In cafés, spoons tapped porcelain and the clink failed to arrive, the note refusing its entrance like a diva unpaid. Mateo heard it first as a tiredness in the air, the way a room feels after a laugh that lands wrong and stays hovering without a chair. By midmorning, Val sent a video of a street preacher whose hallelujahs would not start, his mouth making the shape and the sound arriving late enough to look like an insult; a chorus of vendors around him said ay no at the same moment, as if synchronizing disapproval could mend the physics. Naya arrived through the smell of cilantro and rain with her bag of jars and said that of course the appetite would go for the first bite of sound next, because surfaces are surfaces and hunger is a geometry teacher with bad boundaries.

They took the bowls that had learned consent and found they were useful and not, because lips that refused hands had to learn to refuse ears. Eduardo listened, palm flat to glass the way a man listens to a door and decides if it will spit splinters, and told Mateo that a bowl could be taught to hum no without singing mean. He had worked in a shop once where bells were tuned to call men away from lunch, and he remembered that the easiest way to vex an echo was to give it nothing to do but recognize itself. They strung copper like a lopsided garland along the permission lip and wrapped the foot of the bowl in ruana wool that had been combed of burrs, and when Eduardo struck the rim with the back of a spoon the sound it made was not a note but a nudge, like a hand on a shoulder that says later. In the market they set the new bowls near speakers and asked the city to keep talking. They watched people’s throats learn patience, the way patients learn to swallow pills by convincing their mouths to be doors for a second and then go back to being hospitable.

Ugliness arrived right where the man in the gray suit had promised to find it. Mateo discovered that saying no to shine had earned him love and that love had expected him to be gentle about it forever. The curator who had frowned on an edge called with a voice trained to make injury sound like opportunity and asked if the museum could borrow the bowls for an exhibition on social practice and emergent ritual so that donors could be reassured that the city was still capable of turning its emergencies into objects. She wanted to call it The Permission of Glass. He pictured the bowls under bright white, their lips tired by applause, the hunger drifting through the open doors like a man who had paid for a ticket. He said no without apologizing and felt the meanness of it right down to his knuckles; the curator went quiet for the length of a menu and then told him that she would be obligated to tell the papers that he was anti-institutional, and for the first time in his life the phrase tasted like a blessing. When he told Lucía, she chewed the inside of her cheek like gum and made a growl that did not belong in any human throat and told him she would paint the museum behind a glass it could not exit, as penance.

The syrup para los monstruos, which he had slid into his satchel weeks ago with a shrug and a superstition, began to ask for work. The vendor with careful handwriting told him what it had been meant to do: stain the tongues of children who were learning the pleasure of saying yes too fast, a pretty purple that would tell mothers whether their offspring had been polite to candy or to neighbors. It was sugar and violet and something that had learned stubbornness from a plant; if you touched it to your tongue, for an hour your mouth would betray you, showing the world what you had been willing to let into it. Naya snorted and said there were subtler ways to keep secrets honest, but Val loved the rudeness of it and staged a dare in the plaza where anyone who wanted to swear off answering to the wrong call for a day could let their tongue be purple and therefore public. The sight of bus conductors flicking tongues like lizards and laughing at themselves made the city forgive the vigil of bowls its seriousness. Grandmothers approved because approval was a hobby, and kindergarten teachers approved because at last a moral lesson came in a color that would keep children from despair.

The first time the new hum from the bowls stopped a sound it was cruel and necessary. A thief with a saint tattoo had learned to whistle women out of their concentration when they were counting change; he liked the first second of each coin, the way eyes glance up for one syllable of reprimand and soften because reprimand is permission’s older cousin. He whistled at a woman carrying a baby and the bowl at her elbow sang its no, which was not a note and yet made his lips go inert. He tried again and the second try failed to happen in the same way, which is worse than scolding. He blinked as if someone had turned off a tap inside him and let his cigarette go out so thoroughly he forgot where the flame had been supposed to live. The woman lifted her chin as if to thank no one and everyone and kept walking, and later when he tried to retell it, he could not start the story with the whis; he had to begin with the le that followed and he wasn’t a man who liked seconds, so he stuck to talking about shoes.

It would have been enough to keep bowls humming and sound honest if hunger had not remembered monuments. Cementerio Central, which had been kind when people demanded elegance from air and cruel when governments demanded silence from names, learned to be a speaker box. Val sent a picture of their shadow sitting on a mausoleum roof as if it were a couch with a license, and the captions were joyful until two names in the wall lost their first letters, as if someone had bitten them. The A in ÁVILA became a hole. The J in JULIA did the same and the name breathed differently in a way that made everyone who had ever been a girl angry. Names matter in cemeteries, because what else can you count when you visit a stone, and the idea that anyone would eat the first sound of a person was sufficiently ugly that even those who liked dramas shook their heads and went home to fetch vinegar and bread.

They went at night because night in a cemetery tells men with gray suits to behave and makes dogs out of shadows with better manners than humans. Naya wore a scarf with an attitude and carried a belt of little jars as if she were an aunt about to perform miracles involving beans and shame. Lucía brought a sack of flour and announced that men who had ever tried to walk smooth paths in street shoes would learn humility tonight. Eduardo came, unusual for him, with a bucket of water he had convinced to accept a coin without swallowing it; he said it was a trick taught to him by a cousin who had stolen rings for a living and then had made a profession of returning them. Mateo carried the newest bowl and the oldest and a wire shape that had learned more in his hands than he had asked it to. When they arrived, old women with rosaries like weapons had already formed a line not out of respect for order but because discipline comforts grief, and they told the bowl good evening like a neighbor.

The man in the gray suit leaned on a tomb as if it had ever been an appropriate thing to lean on and said that biting the first letters of the dead offended no one because the dead had no mouths. Val told him to get off the stone and used words as if they were cheap for once, the way teenagers sometimes do when the air needs salt. Naya set the bowl on a vault lid and added one pinch of flour to the rim, whispering to it as if flour had learned to make grammar nervous in a different century. The permission lip did not sing; it tugged at the night as if the dark had ducked a handshake. Together they watched for the trick; hunger used to arrive with a coat; now it had learned taste and would use patience. It came, finally, as a wind that smelled like open books and wet stone. It came as a cough in the throat of someone who had been silent long enough to turn into a myth.

“We do this the ugly way,” Mateo said, because the day had taken too much of his kindness, and the ugly way meant breaking something before it had earned the break. He took a mirror from a plastic shrine, one of those cheap silver-backed rectangles that the dead like because they show your face as plainly as your sins, and smashed it on the stone. Gasps made routines in the crowd; old ladies clucked and then nodded because yes, sometimes Saint Whoever needs to witness a crime to remember why they were wrung into a saint in the first place. He apologized aloud to the object because being impolite to glass makes no sense if your religion is to ask objects to help you. He spread the shards like coins that had sworn off being exchange and set the bowl in their circle; the hunger that had been trying to bite alphabets slunk toward the little lake of silver and stopped, as a cat will stop when a puddle yields back its own whiskers. It put its mouth to the shard and discovered the taste of itself; no one enjoys that first bite. It recoiled and for the space of one long gossip the names on the wall kept their letters.

After, a boy who lived behind the market’s broom closet and sold matches as if they had once made fire asked Mateo if ugly was always going to be the recipe. It was a fair question and his eyes asked it with contempt and hope, both of which trained the soul better than faith does. Mateo told him the trick was not ugliness for its own sake, but the refusal to let pretty rules drown you when the river changed its mind. He said he would buy the boy matches only if he promised to stop trying to sell them to ghosts and start cornering men in suits with their hands in their pockets, and the boy laughed a little too loud and agreed to the wrong thing with a good heart.

On the second night of sound refusing to be born, the buses filled with quiet and then with stories about quiet. A driver named Tino who had lost three teeth to someone else’s mood let a bowl sit on his dash and told his rosaries to stop showing off. The bowl taught the horn not to blare at an old woman crossing the street on a diagonal angle that had offended geometry, and Tino discovered that his chest ached less when the horn had to ask permission. By dawn, the benches at the aqueduct were occupied by men who had come to hear the city without its syllables and had been surprised to like it. Mateo sat with them and counted until the counting gave way to being alive, and the river said nothing meaningful and also everything necessary, which was the language of its patience.

It was there, watching the water that had been insulted by a screen and was now nursing its anger into dignity, that he noticed the man in the gray suit standing beside a worker’s cigarette with his hands tucked into his pockets as if his own wrists bored him. The suit was not alone; with him was a woman Matteo had seen in photographs of protests and in videos posted to online groups that insisted every wound was a conspiracy. She had a voice that enjoyed microphones and a smile that enjoyed lights. “We should make it a thing,” she said, not looking at the river but at the men who had come to not hear. “We should make the city watch itself. A festival. The Museum, the Plaza, the Cemetery, all at once. We will sell attention to people who can afford to put down their phones and see what they are buying. We will call it Silence. We will call it No.” The man in the gray suit admired her teeth and let her own the idea without reminding her of herself; that, Mateo realized, was one of his tricks—he did not need credit when he could spend someone else’s appetite for it.

He felt a meanness rise in him that he decided to keep, like a cat that refuses to be lured outside at night. He imagined the bowls under banners, their hum turned into content, the permission lip tutored into spectacle. He stood and went toward them with the not-smile that happens when a hinge decides to be a lock for a day, and the suit opened his mouth to greet the fight and shut it when Naya arrived between them with a jar of vinegar. She opened it and set it on the rail like perfume and the man stepped back because whatever he was, he did not love the smell of old honesty. The woman who loved microphones said something clever and cruel and was proud of it; Val, arriving on a skateboard that had suffered injuries and survived better for it, filmed without comment and then put the phone away because sometimes refusing to archive a mistake is the kindest way to strangle it.

The jacaranda outside the aqueduct had not finished its work of letting go; petals made a rug that made shoes honest. They sat on the curb like men who were neither saints nor villains and Mateo told Val that they would have to get uglier in a way that would get them yelled at by the right people. You can be forgiven for denying an exhibition; you cannot be forgiven for denying a celebration. It was decided, then, that the bowls would go away for a day, pulled from corners and bus dashboards and saints’ laps, and everyone who had been grateful would feel the absence like a missing tooth they could not keep their tongues from prodding. It was a cruel kindness, and it would show the city that the hum could not be bought with a schedule or a sponsorship. Naya raised an eyebrow as if to say that she had once stolen a saint on the ninth night of a novena and no one had died and much had been learned, and Lucía kissed the air three times in front of the plan and said if people cried she would bring them bread and the purple syrup and insist they laugh at their tongues.

They executed ugly with panache. Eduardo wrapped the bowls in gray towels and wrote on the door of his shop closed for remembering in chalk that made the door look properly modest. They left one bowl where no one would see it, in the old bathhouse underground, watching the mosaic fish with their chipped eyes because even ugliness owes a debt to gratitude. The rest they hid as if hiding were a religion that saved people, and in the spaces where glass had stood people frowned and then told stories about how important it had been for them to have a noise that refused other noises and then were forced to notice that they had learned to say no with their mouths and their throats and their hands without asking permission from an object. It was childish and miraculous and Val celebrated by not posting for twelve hours, which made three people message them in panic and then sit and learn a skill called waiting.

For two hours the suit was delighted, because failure was his job and he had been paid; for two hours hunger tried to eat first syllables and was made ridiculous by silence that had chosen itself. He came to the bathhouse because he had followed the habit of hope to its easiest home, and they were waiting around that one last bowl not like believers but like carpenters. “You will run out of ugly,” he said to Mateo conversationally, as if they were cousins in a kitchen arguing over the last arepa. “You are a beautiful man pretending to be unpleasant and that is a performance, not a profession.” Mateo said something vulgar that would have embarrassed his mother and surprised himself by how much pleasure he took in it, and Val clapped with both hands for form even if the content had surpassed their taste.

Lucía had brought her lamp and set it near the water so that its crack-lines, which had learned to accept not to be repaired, shivered into maps on the tile. She had painted the permission lip of the bowl with a transparent wash that did not change its behavior but did inform the eye that something thoughtful had occurred, and Naya pretended to scold her and then kissed her, because talent has to be punished with affection or it will walk arrogant into a wall. They lit the coil of guarín not to be seen but to pay their tithe to the field. The room smelled like August and vinegar and men who had taken off their shoes to attend to water, and when the hunger tried to step through the reflection it stepped into the smell and was made rural by it against its will.

It was not a victory so much as a lesson stuck, and that would have to be enough for a day. The city could forgive only so much cleverness before it asked cruder prayers. In the evening, the wind brought word that the cable to Monserrate had hiccuped and resumed, the car shivering in its calm, and the boy at the lever had blamed weather when the weather was nowhere to be found. People had taken pictures of their fear and posted them and gotten little hearts, because the appetite the suit courted worked its way into even the most innocent electricity. The mountain sent a message that was both a summons and a warning; Ana made it sting when it reached his ear so he would know to take a jacket. He wrote a note to his mother in a handwriting that remembered to be round where it should be and told the neighbor with the bracelets that if his door made an ugly noise when men in suits knocked, she should not speak to it, and the dog licked his wrist with a tongue that owed nothing to violet syrup.

They went up at night because no one decent schedules a spectacle on a mountain after dark and therefore darkness is the only time anyone sensible tries to save anything there. The funicular ran thin as a promise, and the men at the bottom who had learned never to be surprised made the sign of the cross on their thighs, which they believed was somewhere God didn’t get bored of looking at. The bowl was wrapped, the wire shape slept in his pocket, Val rolled their eyes at the incline as if the angle had behaved rudely, and Naya counted her jars with the intimacy of a woman counting beans she intended to make into an entire feast. Lucía wore a ruana made for small gods and big shoulders and carried a candle and refused to be ashamed of the cliché because clichés are the only right tool sometimes. The car shook once because anything with a cord will shake when it senses a lust near it, and the city spread below with the sullen beauty of a party that forgot to be fun and will be more honest for it in the morning.

At the top, where saints had scraped the sky for favors and lovers had promised everlasting things in voices that hadn’t yet learned to crack, the wind was dressed for an appointment. Ana arrived without elbows and with them; she wore the night like hair and let the bowl’s lip look provincial beside the curve of the mountain. “He will try to make the cable a sentence that never ends,” she told Mateo as if she were reminding him to bring a sweater. “He will try to convince the mechanism that beginnings are better than arrivals. You must be uglier than physics for an hour. You must tell a line to love its end.” He took the coil between his teeth for a second and tasted August and no, and breathed it down until his lungs remembered to be loyal. He put his hand on the metal like a man swears to a tool, and he turned to his friends and told them the worst thing to hear on a holy hill: that they would have to be impolite to a holy object and ask it to remember steel before romance.

Val cracked their knuckles in a way that did not impress the mountain and then impressed themselves, and Naya set vinegar near the cable’s mouth where it entered the machinery that could turn a city into an instrument of prayer or of panic, depending on how the wind liked you. Lucía went to all four corners as if a square could be made out of altitude and said something vulgar into each of them in a different register, not to insult but to remind this place that language belonged to those with mouths and not to men with stories about them. The bowl sat on stone and pretended not to care about the view; Eduardo had handed it to them with a grip he had not meant to show and had told them the lip would not help with metal, and they had told him the lip would help with mouths and that would be enough.

Hunger came late because it was learning manners in the worst possible way. It arrived not in a coat and not in a shadow but in a schedule, written into the pulley with a tidy pencil. The car jerked its little jerk and the couple inside, who had planned to be on a hill for a promise and not for a physics lesson, clasped hands because the alternative had decided to be ridiculous. Mateo put his hands into the shape of his name and held it there until his arms shook and shook again, and he felt the cable consider an argument. He had to make himself ugly enough to disagree with a machine he loved. He put his mouth against the steel and said no in the register that bores prayers and wakes drunks, and the cable hummed a complaint and then obeyed like an animal that is tired of dignity.

It wasn’t dramatic beyond the hearts that noticed. The car slid into the station as if nothing holy had been asked of it, and the couple who had not wanted to die were a little disappointed, which is a thing that happens when you are saved without fireworks. The suit did not show because both absence and presence would have pleased him and he had decided to go fishing for compliments elsewhere. The mountain took off her hat and shook rain into the room as a reward and a scolding, and Ana braided the wind around the bowl like a net for a second and then let it fall back into night because nets are not a lifestyle. They stood under the eaves with the stupid relief of people who have done a mean thing to a machine and been forgiven by all parties who matter, and they did not talk because talking would have mistaken the quiet for an ingredient. He wrote the other name with his hands into the wet air, and this time it didn’t try to be a letter; it persisted as a shape, and the shape belonged to him for one breath longer than it had yesterday.

He descended carrying the bowl like a child who had fallen asleep between houses, and the funicular obeyed not because it was well but because it had been reminded of usefulness, which is better. On the way down he saw the city flatter than truth and felt the ache behind the eyes that comes when you have been stubborn too long at an altitude the body resents. The jacarandas would be making purple into rot while he slept and the saints would be setting out early to sell themselves to kitchens again, and the river would decide what to reflect after it had had its coffee. In the reflection on the glass, the third fish did not try to exist. His face looked older and not interesting, which had been the aim. He kept counting because the night loved being counted. He loved it less for that and loved it anyway. He reached the bottom with a bowl, a mouth that knew no better, and a city that had permitted him to be ugly on her behalf for one hour without charging him interest, and he decided to accept the generosity without thinking of what it would cost him tomorrow.
