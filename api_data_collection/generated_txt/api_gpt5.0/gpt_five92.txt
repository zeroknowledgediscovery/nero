The day my mother said the world had turned gentle was the day I started carrying a folding knife.

“Not for fighting,” she said, pushing my hand away from the blade to the handle. “For prying staples out of your shoes. For apple skins. For opening boxes. There’s nothing left to fight.”

She was wrong, or she was right in a long sweeping way that didn’t touch the little knot that had formed in my chest months ago and tightened at night. You can live under a quilt of safety and still thrash. I put the knife in my pocket and forgot it there only when I needed it most.

From our building you can see the three towers that bracket the river. They rise like matchsticks dipped in copper, names gleaming in the morning: Kestrel, Matra, Lumen. Each belonged to a woman whose face hung on the news tickers and charity galas, faces that smiled and told us to breathe, to drink water, to take our breaks. Bosses, billions, and microdoses of kindness. Men still worked there, naturally; they wore lanyards like leashes except the leash led to coffee and quiet floors and a Monday class on who to ask for help. All the roughness had been swept out of them, so they said, in exchange for something that didn’t have a word yet. It wasn’t surrender. It wasn’t peace. It was like lying on warm stone.

At breakfast, a commercial: a warehouse floor lined with ferns, a conveyor belt slowed to accommodate stretching. A voiceover I recognized—Eleanor Prism, a CEO so soft-spoken the captions had to carry her—“You are not a machine. Please stop pretending you are a machine. Machines are terrible at being you.”

My mother’s eyes were wet. She was never sentimental about the right things. “See?” she said, tearing her toast in half to hand me the part with more jam. “We used to quit and make popcorn when the bosses came on. We used to sit in our cars and breathe like divers before we went in. Don’t ever do that. Promise me.”

I promised with a mouth full of blackcurrant. The jam was from my great aunt, up in North Slope, where she lived in a house that leaned on its elbow against the wind. With some relatives you receive cash around holidays. From Great-Aunt Salome you received jam and small envelopes with clippings: a cartoon, a recipe for a soup that sounded like a Scandinavian ghost, a photo of a pine cone that looked like it was thinking about something. She wrote in a pencil worn to an impatient stub. She had hands that belonged in weather.

It was a surprise to find that the men I had started meeting online spoke of her like you might speak of a storm front. They did not know her name until I typed it and then erased it and then said it aloud to the empty apartment to see if it made a sound like a secret. Salome. Sal-OM. Stone rolling down a hollow. They called her The Aunt. When they spoke about her, at two in the morning, their voices had the frayed brightness of insomnia.

“It has to be blood,” Deke said into his mic, after I sent him a message about small metaphors and nurses and how maybe I could avoid anything sharp. “You can’t do a blood oath with chutney.”

“It’s not an oath,” I said, the kitchen light ticking like a bug. “It’s a metaphor. You don’t have to do the literal thing for the thing to count. Sacrament and sacrifice are cousins not twins.”

“Cute,” Deke said. “Write it on an index card and tape it to a candle. We’ll see if the sky opens.”

He had the flat certainty of a boy who had become convinced that only doing something outrageous could count as doing anything at all. His certainty was a blanket in the room we shared at 1 a.m., covering the bare floorboards, covering our toes. He had joined the Ember Sons. He wanted me to say it like you’d admit to liking an old band again. I would not join any group that named itself that much. Still, I had clicked. They used old words like bulwark and stout and line. They had a crest, a pretend one, a watercolor of a hand holding a candle. A candle burns down, yes, but the hand holds. This was how I was drawn in: not by rage, but by the idea of keeping.

“Women run everything,” Deke said. “They won’t stop until the last rough thing is wrapped. You think softness doesn’t smother.”

Behind him, in his tiny box on the call, his mother walked past in a robe with a cloud of steam around her from the kettle. She paused, put a fresh mug by his hand, kissed his head, and did not ask who he was talking to. The camera trembled when he whispered. “There has to be pushback. Symbolic logic.”

Symbolic logic meant eating my aunt.

It had arrived in the chat like a dare and then tensed into a plan, as if the internet was a muscle. The link led to an argument in paragraphs: a man with a pseudonym referencing iron argued that the only way to break the algorithm of softness was to feed it a glitch, a grotesque interruption. “If we devour the cusp of the benign, the machine will cough,” he wrote. “We must stop being fed and feed ourselves. Blood into the gentle engine will jam it with life again.” He used footnotes to lectures I could not find, a manifesto written in Lisbon on poor paper, men with notebooks in basements under yoga studios, the name of a mountain I’d never climbed.

He did not pick Salome for me. It was my doing. I typed in the chat and backspaced and typed again. That she was old. That she had lived in a building designed by a woman who salted the window frames to keep out moss. That she had never been married (“What is that supposed to mean?” I said to the empty kitchen. “It means nothing. It means she had a life.”) That she made jam instead of money. That she sent clippings. That she believed in the gentle engine and refused to see its slow grind.

“She’s perfect,” someone typed.

I went to bed with the rot of that word in my mouth.

School the next day was practice exams and the smell of disinfectant and a mural in the hall that depicted the city as an open palm. Our principal wore a navy dress with pockets and spoke about resilience without clapping when she said the word. On our desks lay clear rulers with the words “you matter” screen-printed in a font that looked like faraway candy. The girl in front of me had braided her hair into a crown while the teacher wasn’t looking. She turned in her seat to ask if anyone knew which CEO had the best neck scarves. We were professional children. We were being raised like houseplants: a little water, a little sun, turn us twice a week. It was working. The air felt breathable.

On the way home, I passed the base of the Kestrel tower. A video played on the translucent wall: a debate between Eleanor Prism and a man whose sleeves were rolled so far they looked like tourniquets. He kept jabbing his pen. She kept pausing. It was not mercy, the way she paused, but something else. The man’s points buttered themselves and slid down. At the end she said, “We are just choosing not to do harm. That takes work. That takes a lot of work. That is all this is.” She smiled not like a winner but like someone who had remembered a joke. People around me clapped. I clapped as a reflex, to hide the way my hands shook.

At home, I took out the knife, opened it and closed it, opened and closed it, like a pair of lungs. I peeled an apple. The peel came off in a single curling ribbon and fell like a red snake into the sink. I thought I should feel hardened by the task before me. Instead, the idea of it spun me soft: my thoughts kept sinking into other thoughts. I imagined going to see her with my mouth full of promises that I would never make. I imagined a ritual that didn’t require the thing to be done. I imagined biting my own hand instead, or biting a tomato sprinkled with salt and telling no one. There are so many ways to fool yourself if you practice.

When the bus cleared the last row of alder trees and spat us out at North Slope, the wind had already started scuffing the road. The houses here leaned back as if someone had shouted. It smelled faintly of old sugar and soil: people here put things up. They trusted winter too much not to. I walked to her door and knocked with the side of my fist; knocking with knuckles had always sounded to me like wanting to be let in. With the side of the fist you say: I am already here, I am part of the wall.

She opened half an inch. Her cat lunged through the slit and then stopped, confused by its success.

“Nate,” she said. “Your head is taller than it used to be.”

“You see me like once a month,” I said. “You can’t use time as an excuse.”

“I can use anything as an excuse. I’m old and this is my home. Come in and fix my sink.”

She had asked me two days ago if I could look at it. I had said yes and then regretted it immediately, because it would put me in her kitchen and there are places where knives belong and places where they do not. Her kitchen smelled like the end of summer. She had been boiling pectin; the air had a trivial sweetness that made you think of little things with lids.

“It makes that cluck noise, like a chicken with secrets,” she said, tapping the pipe. “I’ve pretended not to hear it for six months. But the shelf keeps moving as if it’s standing on a migrating glacier and I don’t want to wake up one day to find the sugar sleeping with the potatoes.”

She spoke in loops. I loved and hated her for it. I myself was in a loop. When she turned away to lift the kettle, I imagined putting both hands on her shoulder blades and pushing. In the fantasy, she was made of paper. She folded into a crane. She flew. I turned the faucet.

“It’s just a compression nut,” I said, because knowing the names of things had saved me a few times. “It’s worked loose. You have to talk to these every once in a while. They don’t like to be left alone.” I tightened it. The cluck subsided like an animal settling in its sleep.

“Good,” she said, hoisting herself onto the counter without a sign that counters are not chairs. “If we could talk to all the compression nuts we might be okay.”

“Mm.”

“Hmm.”

She had noticed something in me. It’s impossible to hide something from a person who folds her receipts into perfect cranes and puts them on the curtain rods. She paid attention to the weather of little things. She was looking at my hands.

“You’re haunted,” she said.

“I’m a teenager. We come that way.”

“There’s a particular fuzz around you.”

“I’m underdeveloped.”

“You’re overdeveloped in exactly one way, and underdeveloped in your ability to set things down.” She hopped off the counter. “We’ll need soup. Everyone needs soup.”

“It’s June.”

“There’s summer soup.”

She took carrots and garlic out with the efficiency of a person who could do this in the dark. A row of jars on the shelf, amber and red and orange. I thought of what Deke had said and then corrected the thought, because it felt like blasphemy even in my own skull: This is not chutney. This is soup. This is a woman who stayed alive a very long time and would keep staying alive if the world was decent.

“What are you reading?” I said, pitching my voice into the space above the pot.

She breathed out through her teeth, like she had been waiting for permission. “Logs.”

“You a sailor now?”

“Botanist logs. I used to write them. They’re so dull you’d think they were written for gods. With a little shorthand, like a mother’s note slipped into a pocket. ‘Moss thick by the dock.’ And I know who that means. I know what it means that the ink goes down in a rush three lines later. I know who brought me a tomato in their pocket that day and I know we ate it leaning against the shed pretending we were not being watched by the mosquitoes.”

“You miss it.”

“I don’t miss anything. Missing is a trick. It doubles the thing. My friend Iris, who runs something up there with the copper spire, would tell you you’re supposed to miss as self-care so you buy a throw pillow. I have no pillows. I do soup.” She took the knife from my hand as if I had not noticed it was open, and set it down next to the lemon. “Your father was probably like this,” she said. “Did he talk himself into corners?”

“He talked himself into circles which is worse. Circles at least get you back to the beginning. Corners make you stand with your nose to the wall.”

“And then he left. I remember him as laughter and knees and then as someone who only nodded.”

“You remember everyone as laughter and knees.”

“And look what it’s done for me.”

The cat jumped onto the back of a chair and stared at me as if I had come to steal the house. I looked away. In the blotched glass of the window I saw my own face and wondered who it belonged to.

We ate soup sprinkled with pepper that tasted like a memory of fire. Between spoonfuls, I told her things that weren’t a plan but could have been mistaken for one. I told her about school. I told her about Deke, but only the part that sounded like friendship. I did not tell her that he had sent me a PDF titled “To Make the World Sharp Again” that was a masterpiece of circular logic, an Ouija board arranged with numbers. She did not ask. She told me about her neighbor who played cello on her porch every morning for thirty minutes regardless and regardless. “Even in wind,” she said. “Even in rain. She has found a way to pull a music out of damp.” She told me about a workshop she had, about the way you could mend cracked glaze with lacquer and gold dust and make the crack the most honest part. I could tell when she was lying for my sake because the lies were too pretty and she preferred her truths with a little hunch in their shoulders. She was avoiding something. So was I. We were staging a truce. It was beautiful and unbearable.

After the soup, I pretended to go and then turned back at the door. The cat flowed around my ankles like a dark-spilled oil. The house made its evening clicks, the sound of a mind arranging a dream.

“Auntie,” I said.

“Salome,” she said.

“Salome,” I said, because I was trying to be particular in every way I could. “Do you ever think the city is...an arrangement. I mean, of course it is. But more arranged than anyone is admitting.”

She laughed, and the laugh did not make me feel better. “What did you think it was? An accident? Of course there is an arrangement. I prefer that to chaos.”

“An arrangement that is softening everything. My teacher, Ms. Lai, said we were in a ‘tender era.’ She hugged the whiteboard when she said it. She loved the squeak.”

“It isn’t soft,” Salome said, and then corrected herself with an uncharacteristic seriousness. “No, it is soft, but softness can be a blade. That’s what they don’t tell you. It’s just a different kind. When I press my thumb to a sprig of thyme, I am aggressive in a way that would embarrass your principal. We are violent to the right things. When women run companies, we choose different targets. We cut different cords. The engine is still an engine. You still oil it and curse it. Don’t let the ferns fool you.”

“But what if it’s poisoned us. What if we are dying of kindness.”

She picked up the lemon from the cutting board and rolled it back and forth beneath her palm until the oils wept and the room shifted in its brightness. “You’re not dying,” she said. “You’re growing. It hurts because everything is too close to your bones. You’ll get used to that. Don’t call it poison because it feels strange.”

I could have said it then. I could have said: someone says I have to eat you. I had practiced it as a joke. “You are the only one I love enough to devour,” I had said to the mirror, and then flinched at myself like a boy who had caught his reflection wearing someone else’s face. But to say it to her would turn it into a story, and stories have a way of making impossible things seem like the next step in a recipe.

Instead, I said, “I think I’m supposed to do something. I think I’m the kind of person who has to do something.”

“Everyone is that kind of person,” she said. “We are just not all the kind who are given a job that looks like a job.”

“What if my job looks like a crime.”

Her eyelids flickered. Her hands went still. She had been a scientist once, and in that pause I saw the training sweep up from her bones like old sap—a cataloging, a widening, the way you make your mind empty in order to weigh. She did not speak for a while, because she did not want to say the wrong thing and then be held to it like a post.

“There are crimes that are simply the name we give to sudden kindness,” she said at last. “And there are crimes that are crimes. That’s not a helpful answer. I’m sorry. Would you like to take the lemon with you? You can have that. You can take my lemons and see if that helps.”

“I’m planning a menu,” I said, and for a second we were both startled into laughter. The cat sneezed. The house relaxed.

I left without the lemon. The knife was in my pocket. I felt it like a coin in a fairy tale, one that burns if you take the wrong path.

On the bus, Deke messaged me: you gonna do it or do i find someone with a pair

The bus shuddered, and all of us inside swayed like leaves. The driver hummed the same riff he always hummed. A woman across from me was using her phone to look at pictures of dogs in sweaters and making all the appropriate noises of mercy.

I typed: don’t do that. then: there’s no deadline. then: we’re not saving the world. we’re not even saving ourselves. we are teenagers throwing stones into water and waiting for a sound other than a splash. i’m not sure there is one.

Deke, who was used to me doing this, sent a skull emoji and then a candle. Then: read this. He sent a story about a boy in another century who had to steal salt from his mother’s table to bargain with a river. It was nonsense. I loved it. I couldn’t use it for proof.

When I got off, the wind slapped me like a mother who knew I had been about to put my hand on a hot stove. It was late. The sky pulled itself thin over the roofs. The building door stuck in the frame the way it always did; you had to lift and lean, as if the door weighed something only a certain kind of person could lift. Inside, my mother was asleep on the couch with a book open on her chest and a glass of water sweating onto a magazine. The TV had paused on Eleanor Prism’s face, the captions waiting for us to return to them. I turned everything off and stood in the dark as if it were a chapel.

In the morning I went to Kestrel.

“Are you here to see anyone?” the woman at the desk asked. She had the hard beauty of someone who had worn a helmet at some point in her life.

“Just looking,” I said, and was surprised when that worked. The lobby was an indoor forest. Each tree had a small plaque: what it was called, where it came from, who had donated it, what changing light would do to it over the next decade. People sat on benches and worked while birds flitted on jets of invisible air. The birds were mechanical; when they landed their feet trilled like bells. It was supposed to be calming. It was creepy if you breathed correctly.

A plaque on the wall said: We have nineteen floors where nothing happens. It is very important that we stand around together doing nothing. Call it culture, call it rest, call it room for error. You will never be asked to justify it. —E.P.

I thought: if you wanted to destroy this, how would you do it. I thought: if you wanted to save this, why would you do it. My thoughts were arranging themselves into questions because questions feel like progress even when they are a way to sit still.

On the mezzanine, two women were arguing in front of a whiteboard with magnets shaped like fruit. “You can’t require joy,” one said, plucking a pear off and letting it fall into a cup. “Happiness quotas are the stupidest thing we’ve tried.” The other woman gestured with a marker, polka-dots of ink on her fingers. “We don’t require it. We count it so it shows up on the spreadsheet so it keeps existing. If you can’t see it, it gets cut. I hate that that’s true more than anyone.” They noticed me and did not stop. The argument had the feel of algebra: you could solve it, and whatever answer you got you would still have to double-check. They were harmless. They were also dangerous in the way all office fights are dangerous: they calcify into policy. I memorized their faces the way you memorize a pothole.

“Hey,” a voice said. “You’re a kid.”

“No,” I said automatically.

“Want to ask me something.”

She was small, but small like a valley, contained and surprisingly deep. I knew her face without knowing why. Her hair was cut in a way that made me want to get a ruler and check the angles. She wore a scarf that would be mentioned in the comments of any video she appeared in and given its own fan accounts. Eleanor Prism.

“Yes,” I said, as if I had decided that only answering yes to anyone would keep me alive. “Why is it all so...soft. Is that condescending? Do you think we’re vegetables.”

Some part of me wanted her to slap me. For her to be hard, so the story would make more sense.

She did not slap me. “I think we are animals,” she said. “I think we need soft things to survive. Soft is not a slur. You’re carrying a little knife. Are you embarrassed about that.”

My hand jerked. “No,” I said. “It’s for apples.”

“Good,” she said. “Apples are the only way we get through mornings.”

“Do you think you’ve damaged us. The men.”

“Yes,” she said, and the honesty of it made my eyes burn. “But not the way you think. We have taken away a lot of reasons to perform the worst parts of yourself. That feels like damage if you loved those performances. It is also a relief. You can sit down. You can stop clenching. Everyone can stop clenching.”

“What if someone needs to do something terrible for the sake of the world.”

“You want me to absolve you in advance,” she said. “So that when you do it you can tell yourself a woman told you to. No. I won’t give you that. If you do something terrible you will have to own it and then live with the ways it wobbles through everyone around you. That is not a threat, that is logistics.”

“Thank you,” I said, because thanking is what you do when someone puts something heavy in your hands before you’ve realized it’s too heavy to lift.

“Tell your aunt I still have her mint cuttings,” she added, walking away. She did not turn to see my face. She did not need to. Of course, they all know each other. Of course, softness is a network. Of course, everyone is someone’s friend.

I went to the library and printed out three pages from the Ember Sons site: a page of instructions that read like poems, a list of precautions that read like a curse, and a single line I had underlined five times: Only devotion has force. I folded the pages into squares so small they could have been coins. On the way home, the wind ate one. I let it.

Night again. The city creaked. The knife in my pocket felt like a lie I kept telling. I dreamed of red string. In the morning, I told myself I would wait, I would wait for a sign, perhaps the sign would be a phone ringing from an unknown number and then I’d pick up and a voice would say, “Don’t do it.” The phone did ring. It was my mother asking me to get milk.

At the grocery store, a woman in a blazer arranged the yogurt cups so that the flavors made a gradient. She smiled at me as if I had succeeded at something by noticing. There was a station near the door where anyone could grab a snack if they were hungry. No one watched the station; there was nothing to steal because the act of taking redefined itself in the presence of so much permission.

Deke messaged me a map.

don’t be dumb. the longer you wait the more your courage turns to porridge. head north. today. she’s old.

As if being old made you edible. As if being tender made you a target. I typed back: i’m not an animal

He said: you are.

And that wasn’t wrong. I walked.

The day had the jittery light of days when something will happen, even if the something is that nothing happens but it happens with intensity. At the end of her street, two kids were using a stack of pizza boxes as armor, whacking each other with foam swords. One of them shouted the name of a dragon and then corrected himself because the dragon’s name had become unfashionable online. The correction made him laugh. Our lives were ridiculous in the way all good lives are ridiculous. Try telling that to someone who has decided he must use his body as a lever.

At the door, I did not knock. I pressed my ear to the wood, then laughed at myself and knocked anyway.

She called: “In.”

Her voice sounded like it always did, the opposite of a portent. It said: bread. It said: come fix my clock. It said: be here for a while, do not hurry to leave, leave when you need to and I will not pretend grief, do not punish me with loyalty. It said: humans are silly and I am silly with them. This is why prophecy is cruel; it makes that voice into a test.

Inside, she had her sleeves rolled and a lemon on the counter again like a dot at the end of a sentence.

“I thought you’d take the lemon,” she said.

“I was worried it would be a symbol.”

“Everything is a symbol. Choose yours.”

“I’ll take something else.”

She lifted the cloth covering a loaf of bread. She pressed two fingers into the crust. She looked at me looking at her hands pressing into the bread.

“This is the part of the day,” she said, “where I think of how stupid we were when we were young. Which is to say: how brave. We thought we were the only ones waking the world up. We were waking ourselves and the world was making coffee and nodding. This city belongs to women who are on their second pot. They are nice and they are nervous and they are not going away. You can sit in the corner and be a philosopher about it or you can join the tea brigade and rinse cups. Both are noble. One gives you someone to talk to.”

She waited for me to say something. I did not. The knife in my pocket had a weight that did not match anything I was.

“I know about your little club,” she said, and the words were a hand that opened the window and let in cold. “They sent me a letter, by mistake. Addressed to the wrong S. A letter about eyes and edges. Boys do this. Every ten years: the words change, the bone is the same. Somewhere there is a room with a bad printer and a man who paces.”

“It was a mistake,” I said in a voice that wanted to be older. “They’re not a club. It’s an idea.”

“Oh good,” she said. “Everyone knows ideas can’t hurt you.” She wasn’t cruel. She said it with a lazy kindness that made me burn. “You haven’t asked me to sit. That’s your tell. Usually you make me sit so you can stand over me while you talk like one of those doctors who enjoy telling people about naming opportunities for wings. Today you want me taller. You want the chair. You want to be younger.”

“I don’t want to be anything,” I said. “I want to be someone who doesn’t have to do this.”

“What, then.”

I said it. At last. I said the thing like it was a prayer and a joke and a dare, and my voice broke open the room. After the words were out they arranged themselves in the air over the counter and sat there like a strange bird.

“I have to eat you,” I said, and time did not stop, because time is rude like that. The kettle clicked. A car passed. The cat leapt from the chair and missed and had to pretend he had meant to fall. She looked at me and did not look away.

“Well,” she said, because she had been raised not to leave a statement standing there without a coat. “How much.”

“What.”

“How much of me. It’s a practical question. I need to know if I should write a note for the woman who gets my recycling. People need hints at bad moments.”

“Don’t do that.”

“Do what.”

“Make it easy.”

“I’ll try and make it hard then,” she said, and her voice went low, and I saw the girl she had been, smuggled by freight and fever into this old house. “Your father would have loved this. A deed that made him feel both brave and doomful. He would have carved a spoon to commemorate it.”

“Stop putting him in this. He left. He didn’t even leave with any effort. He left sideways.”

“Better men have left straighter. It still leaves a hole. Don’t fill the hole with my liver.”

“I wasn’t—” I gagged on the word. “I wasn’t going to—”

“You think I don’t read? I have a computer. I know boys. I love boys. I have eaten with boys. I have held their faces while they threw up. You think this is new. You think you discovered the ritual. Nothing is ever new. You are uniquely loved, not unique.”

“Then say no,” I said, which was the most childish thing I have said since I was six. “Say stop me.”

“I have no power you don’t give me,” she said. “If the spell is to eat me and the spell is in your head, I can only hit your head with a spoon and hope. Sit. Sit.”

She set a plate in front of me. Bread. Salt. A little dish with oil in it that caught the light. My body did the thing bodies do when you give them bread. The knife lay on the counter. My hands lay on the table. Everything was a verb and a noun at once. Eat, it said. Eat. Eat. Eat something else. Eat anything else.

“You could take a piece of me in a way that keeps me,” she said, speaking like she was telling a story to someone in another room. “A swab of saliva. A clipping of hair. A pinch of blood. Animal. It would be enough for any magic that isn’t pure theater. Most magic is theater. Men think theater is beneath them so they go make a mess to feel superior. Meanwhile the women at the back clean glitter out of the carpet and call it a miracle. You could do the theater and call it truth.”

“They say it has to be real.”

“It’s real if you do it,” she said. “We could make a marinade for the idea. We could cook it until it falls apart. We could feed it to the neighbor with the cello. She’s too thin. She needs fat. Eat your aunt, yes, the way a cat eats sunlight. You’ll still be guilty. That will still be yours. But you will not be a boy who did something he can’t sit in a room with for the fifty years he has left, because that’s the trap. They don’t build countries for you anymore, so they build traps.”

I could feel Deke through my phone, glowing. I could feel a thousand men in a thousand basements with their notebooks, waiting to be validated by a boy in a kitchen. I could feel my father laughing in a bar, not knowing why. I could feel myself deciding and then undeciding and then calling both decision and undecision integrity.

“How much,” I said, an echo in a bottle.

She got the kit she kept for splinters. It was in a tin with a picture of a bird on it. She opened it with the practiced care of someone who has done this for others and for herself. She took the needle from its paper. She heated it with a match. She pricked the pad of her thumb. She held it over my plate and let one drop fall onto the bread like a terrible olive.

“Eat that,” she said. “Eat that, and later you can decide if you’re a wolf or a boy or something else. And if you decide to be a wolf we will deal with that then. We have wolves. Life is not terrifying because of wolves; it’s terrifying because of how lovely lambs are. Don’t look at me like that. Eat.”

My mouth filled with water. It was not dramatic; my body had been trained well by soup. I picked up the bread. I bit. It tasted like bread and salt and whatever oil does to a tongue, and beneath it, metallic as the taste of biting your own lip, a small clean hurt.

The moment did not alter the color of the walls. It did not split the day. The sky above the house remained gray. Outside, a truck rattled past, hauling someone’s new couch. The knife remained on the counter, uninvolved.

She watched me and I wanted to tell her that I loved her and that she had done a brave thing and that bravery is never enough and that I would still have to walk around with the boy I had been who would have bitten a different thing if she had asked in a different voice. Instead, my body, which was smarter than I was, swallowed.

I sat back. I waited for some machine to cough. I waited for the city to flicker. The lights did not blink. Somewhere, women who ran things kept running them at a pace that allowed for breath. Somewhere, boys planned a ritual that would ride on the back of some other excuse. The soft did not harden. The gentle did not crumble. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

“See,” she said, as if I had managed to open a jar. “Now you can decide what you are next. The deciding is the only part, in the end. Everything else is garnish.”

I thought of Deke’s skull and candle. I thought of the tiny underlined sentence in the printout in my pocket. Only devotion has force. I thought of how slippery devotion is, how easy it is to mistake attention for love and love for hunger and hunger for a moral that will be applauded in rooms where men pace in front of bad printers. I looked at my aunt and saw no monster, no keystone, no soft engine. Just a woman who had fed me so many times she had lost count. Just someone who had put her thumb into a loaf of bread and told the truth. The most terrifying thing I had eaten was my own idea.

“Tell Deke,” she said, as if she had read a text over my shoulder, and maybe she had, the way older people read things, through the air. “Tell him the women are very dangerous.”

“But they’re harmless,” I said, with my mouth, and she laughed because we were finally speaking the same language.

“They are harmless the way moss is harmless,” she said. “Try walking and see how you slip. Try holding still and see how it scours. Harmlessness isn’t something you get to use as a sentence. It’s a setting.”

We cleaned up. We put things away. We set the knife back in the drawer with all the other knives that weren’t for anything like this. I took the lemon. I took a jar of blackcurrant jam. She kissed my forehead in the place where babies have soft spots and boys grow scar tissue. When I left, the wind had stopped. The street had that weird pause, as if even air needs a smoke break.

On the way home, I texted Deke a picture of the bread crumbs on my plate. He responded with a line of clapping hands and then: next time the whole prayer

I typed: there won’t be a next time. we did theater. it worked. the city is exactly as it was, which is to say, not at all. i can’t explain it

He replied with one word: coward

I put the phone in my pocket and took it out and put it back ten times like a heart I could control. When I got home, my mother was awake and cutting coupons—which is an act of worship if you think money is god. She looked up and saw something about me and did not name it and loved me for it anyway. On the TV, a new ad: Matra Solutions introducing an initiative to reduce meetings that don’t need to exist. The slogan: Be somewhere else if you need to. In my pocket, the paper pressed against my thigh: Only devotion has force. In my mouth, the taste of metal had faded into something like pride and something like shame and something like whatever broth becomes after you’ve eaten whatever was in it.

I slept. In my dream, the city was a field of bread and we ate our way across it, arguing about whether the crumbs meant we were lost. In the morning, light. Very simple light. The kind that doesn’t suggest anything about what you should do. The kind that just exists. I decided to be a boy for one more day and see what happened if I refused every test that seemed staged for me. I decided to remember the feel of a lemon rolling under my palm. I decided to carry the knife because you never know when you’ll need to open a box. I decided that if the world asked me for a crime, I would find a way to do something tender instead and then live with the complicated echo of that. I decided that the next time a man with a notebook in a basement told me about a ritual, I would bring soup to his door and see if he could eat in front of me without crying.

At school, Ms. Lai wrote on the board: “Please do not confuse rigor with cruelty.” On the news, Eleanor Prism said: “Please do not confuse care with control.” On the internet, Deke typed a paragraph that started with: “Please do not confuse boyhood with—” and I did not finish reading it. I ate my aunt. It was not enough. It was too much. It was not the point. It was the only way through a part of myself that wanted to stand at the edge of something and howl. I went to the cafeteria and got a second helping of mashed potatoes. The woman with the hairnet said, “Big day?” I said, “Yes,” and she said, “Good,” in a way that made me want to panic and to be calm at the same time. A sign on the wall said: Drink water. I did. It didn’t fix anything. It was still the right thing to do.The day after I decided to be a boy for one more day, Ms. Lai handed back our practice essays and asked, gently, if anyone wanted to revise. I had written about rigorous kindness and how it leaves fingerprints more than knives do. She had circled a sentence where I said “We are all janitors of each other,” and written in the margin: “Tell me what this actually looks like.” The words felt like a cup held out for water. All morning, my classmates bled glitter glue onto posters about urban wetlands and the ethics of snack distribution in long meetings. Someone had started a petition to let the plants in the atrium go to seed instead of keeping them clipped into polite geometry. The announcement over the loudspeaker thanked us for remembering sunscreen. I used my clear ruler to measure the distance between two holes someone had punched into the bulletin board and pretended I was calculating the circumference of an argument.

At lunch, Deke thumped his tray down across from mine and grinned like someone who had stayed up all night building a fort out of rules. He had that fever-pale look, like the inside of his eyelids had been showing him slides. He had taped the Ember Sons crest—a watercolor fist holding a candle—to the back of his phone case. I pretended not to see it, which is also a way of seeing.

“You’re invited,” he said, and slid a folded paper across the table with two fingers like he was feeding a cat that might bite. “No more screens. In a room, finally. We do things in rooms now.”

“I have a room called home,” I said, because my mouth liked to make little useless barricades. “I sit in it. It’s enough.”

“It isn’t,” he said. “You did a play with bread and now you’re trying to call it life. Come meet people who don’t think food is an argument. It’s tonight. Under Bluegate Yoga. Seven. Don’t be late, we voted to despise lateness.”

It was almost sweet, the way he thought structure would save him. It was almost sweet, the way I thought I could stay away. I said I might come. He nodded as if I had signed something. When he left, my mashed potatoes had gone a skin on top, like a lake in an early winter pretending. I ate them anyway, because I didn’t think the world needed me to start disdaining skins. Ms. Lai walked by and rested her hand on the top of my head for a second like she was blessing a loaf. “Tell me what that looks like,” she said again, low, not just about the sentence. I couldn’t tell if she meant the future or the petition about the ferns. I wanted to say: it looks like nineteen floors where nothing happens and nobody asks why. It looks like my aunt’s thumb pricked and a drop on bread. It looks like a boy walking away from a dare and shaking with the effort. But she had already moved on to a girl whose braid had fallen apart, and I let the moment pass as if it were a bus that would circle back.

My mother texted to ask if we owned a ladle. The question was a trap designed to catch a day by its ankle and swing it around. Owning a ladle felt like a moral stance in our house. I looked in the drawer and saw that we did not. I wrote back: we own spoons and ambition. She wrote: that will do. I told myself the room under Bluegate was another person’s problem. I told myself I would go home, make a sandwich, watch a documentary narrated by someone whose voice would make me feel smarter than I was, and fall asleep with my mouth open on the couch like a dog. I walked past Bluegate on purpose. The sign was a painting of a shoulder joint cradled by vines. The chalkboard out front said “Tonight: Candlelight Stretch. Tomorrow: Breath for People Who Hate Breath.” A man in a scarf identical to six other men’s scarves adjusted the chalkboard and smiled at me with the exact amount of nonthreat you learn from a corporate training with a tasteful montage of hands. I kept walking until my feet remembered that you can stand up to your head.

The door down to the basement was propped open with a brick the size of a book. Stairs received me like a throat. The air smelled like toner and damp and coffee that had decided to be philosophy. Inside, Deke was there with an energy that made me want to clap just to get some of it out of the room. About twenty men in various stages of boy were spread along plastic chairs pretending to be pews. The youngest had the clean-shirt urgency of the newly converted. The oldest had faces like docks—weathered, used, useful, a little splintered, the kind that make you want to tie something to them and trust the knot. On the wall was the crest, magnified and printed with a printer so bad it had chewed the hand into stairs. The candle was a rectangle. My chest hurt with the effort not to laugh or cry. I found a place near the back where the shadow picked up after the fluorescent lights lost interest.

A man with elbows like the corners of opinions stood up and began to talk. He had the voice of a person who had taught himself how to be believed in rooms just like this. I would have known him anywhere because he was the kind of man people think must be named Clark or Adam but who, in this context, had called himself Wrought and asked us to call each other by our chosen metals like we were pretending to be swords.

“We are here,” he said, “because we refuse the drowning called care.” He had a way of pausing as if waiting to be interrupted by history. “We are not against kindness. We are against sedation. We are against your bosses telling you to hydrate while they grow your leash out of silk. We are against the sterility of a world that asks you to be harmless and calls it good. We will make a noise a tender machine cannot digest.”

It was too easy to hate him. Hating him felt like a hobby I could take up and enjoy responsibly in the evenings. He did not say anything untrue at first. He named things that were true in ways that made them untrue, which is a trick anyone can learn if they practice with a mirror. He asked us to imagine being eaten by moss. He asked us to remember how it felt to be told to breathe by a video. He asked us if we had known hunger lately, and half the room laughed because their mothers had learned to pack snacks.

Deke caught my eye and nodded, which in our language meant: see, see, he is singing our song. Wrought pulled up a slide on a jittery projector that showed the three towers like instrument strings. He talked about air feeds and maintenance protocols and small sabotages that would feel like an earthquake because the floors had been taught to equate quiet with good. He had names for the acts. A Quieting that was actually noise. A Cut that was not a cut. A Meal in which no food was eaten, just an idea consumed publicly until its bones showed and everyone clapped because it was over.

I realized I had been waiting for it. I had been waiting for him to say The Aunt, and when he did not I found myself stupidly angry. It shouldn’t have mattered that I had made Salome into a secret. He didn’t deserve her as a symbol. He didn’t deserve anyone. My anger had the cheap taste of oxygen and then the lead taste of having something real underneath it. I lifted my hand, felt like a child asking to go to the bathroom, told myself I would keep my mouth shut, and then heard my voice tell on me.

“I ate her,” I said, and everyone turned, and Deke put his forehead on the chair back in front of him and muttered Jesus with the wobbly reverence of a boy who didn’t mean it. “Not the way you want. A drop. Bread. Salt. It did not make a dent in the sky. I went outside and the wind was still wind.”

Wrought looked at me with the interest you give an insect that has carried the tiniest piece of glitter across a table. “Theater,” he said. “I’m not against it. Theater is bread for the eyes. The world has overfunded theater because it is cheaper than blood. I am not calling you a coward, son. I am calling you someone who has not yet met the wall that wants you. Our work is not suggestion. Our work is force. Only devotion has force, and devotion is proved by harm.”

He had stolen my sentence and sharpened it in his mouth. The room hummed. I felt everyone’s bodies calibrating to the possibility of a task. I thought for a second I would choke on the smell of toner and coffee and want. Then the door opened and three women came in carrying thermoses and a tray of paper cups with careful fingers. They wore the high-visibility vests you put on if you want to be seen as staff by anyone who has a conscience. Their hair was braided and pinned, their wrists humming with rubber bands. The one on the left looked like someone’s aunt and also like a marathon. “Tea,” she said, and she did not say anything else because the offer took all the air it needed.

The room rearranged itself without asking permission. Men who had planned to be hard had to deal with sugar. Men who had planned to be wolves found themselves holding cups. The smell of lemon and mint pulled at the part of the brain that is seven years old and being handed half a cookie by a person who knows you stole the first half and does not care. One of the women stood near me and checked the thermostat with the efficiency of someone who knew this building better than any of us. Deke stared at his tea like it might call him by another name.

“We have a permit,” one of the women said, when Wrought finally found his voice and asked who had sent them. She held up a piece of paper and I had to laugh because it looked like every other piece of paper except its power came from the fact that it existed when a man needed to see it. “Bluegate’s community nights are covered. You can talk revolution, we bring hydration. You can talk harm, we bring heat. Everyone gets to finish their sentence with a throat that works. Are we clear.”

“We’re clear you’re chaperoning grown men,” Wrought said, and he made the word chaperoning into a slur, which didn’t work because it sounded like a soft cloak you’d borrow on a bad night.

“Good,” she said. “So no one chokes.” She poured me tea and slid a wrapped sugar across my knee. She had the forearms of someone who had carried twenty cups at once through a crowd twice a day for twenty years. I wanted to hug her with a gratitude that would embarrass us both.

The tea didn’t win the room. Nothing wins a room. Rooms are stubborn and proceed according to the math of their furniture. But it complicated the math. Complication is the kind of sabotage I understand. Wrought adjusted and asked us to consider the specifics of “the Kestrel event.” He said it like a wedding. He said we would enter as if we were employees because men know how to be employees even when we pretend to despise it. He said we would find the nineteenth floor and set the alarms to a frequency that would make birds fall. He said we would pour vinegar into the humidifiers for the ferns and watch as the gentle curled its nose. He said we would pry open the panel that made that soft rain sound in the lobby and stuff it with rags so it would sound like a body rolling down stairs. He said we would leave a note that read: This is what waking feels like.

I could hear the men falling in love with the image of themselves in vests. The women with the tea kept pouring as if the plan were an allergic reaction you treated with warm liquids and time. Deke looked at me the way boys look at each other right before they do something that will become a story they tell each other until they are old enough to stop telling stories. He wanted me near him when he put his hand in the electric panel so he could say later that I had been near. He wanted me to be his witness even if I was not his accomplice.

I thought of the plaque at Kestrel that announced nineteen floors where nothing happens. I thought of the girls arguing about happy metrics, and Eleanor Prism’s scarf making its own wind as she walked past. I thought of my aunt’s thumb and the bread. I thought of the cello on the porch next to Salome’s house playing against rain. I didn’t think of my father on purpose, which was a sign he had won something.

The meeting ended in a clatter of chairs that sounded like an applause track for a mediocre sitcom. Men folded flyers into pockets as if paper had ever saved anyone. Deke clapped me on the back hard enough to burp me like a baby. “You coming,” he said, and the question wasn’t a question, it was a dare with a ribbon. I told him I needed to get a ladle. He called me ancient. He said he’d text me a time and a way in. He said if I didn’t come it would be proof of something I didn’t want to think about. He hugged me with one arm like a brother who had somewhere else to be.

On the way up the stairs, the woman with the permit caught my eye and with a tiny motion that made me want to kneel handed me a napkin with a number on it. “If you’re going to go somewhere dangerous,” she said, “tell someone who knows how to find stairs in the dark.” The napkin smelled like orange peel and a clean kitchen. I put it in my pocket next to the printout I kept rubbing as if friction would turn it into a charm.

I went to my aunt’s without deciding to. The weather had that in-between arrogance of late June, telling you it could do anything and you’d call it summer. Her neighbor was on the porch with her cello, bow moving in a steady line that was almost more interesting than the sound. Salome had a list on the wall by the door titled Things That Make It Bearable numbered to twenty-three and unnumbered after that. She had added to it in a handwriting that had more loops on bad days. Today the loops were under control. She saw me and did not ask, which is what love looks like when it’s mature and tired.

“I need a story,” I said, and sat with my back against her refrigerator because the refrigerator did not care what I was. “Not a pretty one. A story with mud and dumbness in it.”

She stretched her legs out so her feet touched mine, a ridiculous bridge that worked anyway. “When I was twenty-one,” she said, “the road commission decided to take a straight line through a stand of spruce that had been doing fine for longer than we had been doing anything. We did the usual pretty things. We chained ourselves to the trees in vintage dresses and floral shirts. We wrote to committees. We turned our bodies into punctuation marks. The men cutting had orders and we had slogans. Everyone cried for the same ten minutes and then we started again. At some point we remembered to feed them. I don’t mean hand them food like tips you give a dog. I mean we moved the camp stove to the edge of the cut and made something so simple it was impossible to say no. Bread. Broth. A tomato sliced open with a jackknife and sprinkled with the same pinch of salt we used on our own tomatoes. They kept cutting and they kept eating and at the end of two weeks a man who had slept sitting up for a decade put down his saw and wrote his daughter a letter on the back of the menu we had made that said, ‘I have been thinking of gentleness like it was a lie they told to sell me soap. It might not be. I might be stupid.’ The road went through anyway, because roads go through at least the first time. But the next one kinked and the next one looped, and if you ask the right person in a room with a printer, they will tell you it is because they felt silly eating our soup with their gloves on. That is what I have. Mud. Dumbness. Tomatoes. A man who changed a little. A road that didn’t go straight because a woman stood there with a ladle.”

“I told Deke I was getting a ladle,” I said, and wanted to cry and throw a chair and call my mother all at once.

“Good,” she said, because she loves objects that admit what they are. “Bring two. One for the enemy. He’s you, remember. He’s you on a day you didn’t get soup.”

“He’s going to Kestrel,” I said. “They’re going to pour vinegar into the lungs of the building and make it cough birds. They will make a noise and call it waking.”

“You can go with them and pour it out,” she said. “You can go ahead and ask the woman with the scarf for help and she’ll tell you to tell her friend Iris that you’ve been brave in a way that doesn’t feel like bravery. You can stay home and be a boy which is work. You can stand in the lobby and hold out your hands like a guardrail and ask men to pour their vinegar into your palms, which will hurt. I am old enough to tell you there isn’t a right choice. There is a ridiculous choice that makes you more like yourself.”

“I don’t know who that is.”

“You do,” she said, and picked up a jar with a label that read Blackcurrant 9 because we had gotten to nine and forgotten to plan for ten. “He is the one who did a tiny wrong thing in my kitchen and then sat there and let the night not absolve him. He is the one who didn’t make me into a story bigger than my stove. He is the one who keeps forks in the right drawer. He is the one who brings his mother milk unasked because a text counts as asking. I’m mocking you. I am also right.”

I wanted the world to give me a ritual that was a knife. It kept handing me lemons. “Do you know Iris,” I said. “Do you know Eleanor. Are you out here exactly two steps removed from everyone who can make a guard fall asleep.”

She smiled the way you smile when a child sees how a trick works and still claps. “I know everyone because I have fed everyone. That is the only network that matters. I will call Iris and tell her I have a boy who wants to do theater so hard it cracks something. She will tell me she has just the thing. Please pretend this is difficult for her. It makes her feel like a woodpecker.”

When I left, she put a hand on the back of my head and pressed gently, a cue dogs understand. The cello next door was still pulling its line through rain. I texted the number on the napkin and a woman named Leda texted back in a tone I could hear through the letters: we have you. I texted my mother and asked if we could own a ladle. She sent a picture of herself holding one like a trophy and said, already solved. I texted Deke and said, I’m coming, but I need ten minutes at the start to do something stupid that will make everything worse and better. He sent back an emoji that was a volcano and then the word: hell yes.

That night I put the knife in my pocket and a ladle in my bag. I wore a vest I had borrowed from a boy who worked maintenance at the school who liked me because I carried heavy things when he didn’t want to. I braided a little of my hair badly because I had watched a video and failed and not being good at things in public was also a ritual I was trying. The city looked like it does when people have decided to behave: lights, small movements that mean work, deep pockets of nothing where work isn’t needed. Kestrel’s lobby glowed like a well-meaning aquarium. The birds on the air jets made the sound bells make when they are trying to be bells quietly. A woman at the desk looked up and decided I was allowed to be. The floors above hummed with the electricity of rest, which is real electricity, which is more dangerous to play with than the angry kind because it will not punish you right away.

Deke met me by the fern wall and punched my shoulder. He had shaved badly. He had wrapped a scarf around his lower face as if breath was a trademark. Three boys I didn’t know rolled a tool chest into a corner like we were in a play where we had props. Wrought was not there; he had sent lieutenants with names like Slate and Temper. They nodded at me like they were not sure if I belonged to the part of the plan that works. I asked for ten minutes. Slate looked at the clock with a theatrically long sigh, which is a luxury you get when you think time belongs to you.

I went to the desk. “I’m here with the tea,” I said to the woman with the helmet-beauty who had the nametag that read T. “We’re going to need a place to put ladles and the bad decision unit of the Ember Sons.”

She blinked once and then laughed into her sleeve. “Of course,” she said, because someone had told her once to always choose the path that made paperwork easier. “Nineteenth. We have couches no one has cried on yet. It would be a shame not to start.”

On the nineteenth floor, the lights were lower in a way that said someone cared about how your eyes feel when you are not using them for anything. There were blankets and a glassed-in box full of plants that didn’t look like they would ever be forced into shapes. There were little signs that said: Nothing is required of you. There was a woman asleep with her mouth open on a beanbag, an intern who had learned to nap publicly. There was a table that wanted tea. I set the ladle down and it made a sound like a spoon learning responsibility. Leda arrived with her thermoses and her vests and her eyebrows full of certainty. Eleanor Prism walked in wearing a scarf the blue of clean water and looked at me as if I was a class she remembered loving.

“Please don’t absolve me,” I said before she could do anything with her face.

“I won’t,” she said, and then she made me want to cry by wiping a ring of dust off the edge of a plant tray with her thumb. “Where will the noise be.”

“In the lobby,” I said. “In the ducts. In our heads.”

“When the birds fall,” she said, “we will pick them up. We will make the alarm into a metronome. We will make noise into music whether you like it or not.”

“That seems like cheating.”

“Everything is cheating,” she said. “That’s why fairness is a mess. Go talk to your boys.”

On the way down, I passed teams of women in clothes with pockets and men with hands in those pockets because they had been taught to make themselves smaller when they didn’t know what to do. I found Deke and Slate crouched by a panel that looked like a blank face. They had a tool wedged into an expression. I knelt and put my palm flat on the wall like I was checking for fever. I said, without any particular authority, “Wait,” and for some reason all of them did. The birds jingled like someone had breathed through teeth in another room. The ferns made mist that turned my hair sticky.

“This is theater,” I said. “And theater is not beneath you unless you want to keep losing to people who are better at it. We can make this scene into something else. We can pour the vinegar into a bowl and call it a blessing and ruin your line. We can make you show your faces.”

Deke’s mouth made a small mutiny, and then he smiled in a way that broke my heart because it was exactly how he smiled when we were eight and we stole a marshmallow before dinner and he needed me to be the part of the plan that would keep us from being caught. “Let’s do both,” he said. “Noise and tea. Vinegar and ladles. Blood and bread. Let’s jam their softness and then fix the jam we spilled.”

“It won’t impress Wrought,” Slate said. “He needs proof.”

“Of what,” I said. “That care is control. That control is care. That we can be animals without being monsters. That only devotion has force. Be devoted to something that doesn’t require a janitor with a mop to come after you like a god.”

I saw it: the tiny swivel. It’s not redemption; I don’t believe in redemption as an event. It was a small turn of a cog in Deke’s head that made a new sound even if he kept walking. He nodded and took the bottle of vinegar out of his bag and held it like it might grow teeth. He unscrewed the cap and the air went sharp with the smell of pickles and sudden decisions. He poured it into the ladle I held and my wrist burned where a drip had gotten free. We walked together toward the nineteenth floor as if we had been given a job that was both beneath and beyond us.

I do not know what you call what happened after because words muscle their way to the front of a line at times like that and make you think you have named something when all you have done is hand out hats. Men brought their rags and their voltage and their hunger. Women brought their thermoses and their permits and their eyebrows. The birds fell and were caught and some of them trilled in shock and some of them were quiet and we put them on the couches and their little mechanical chests rose and fell in a way that would have made a crueler boy kick to see if it was real. Someone turned the alarm into a rhythm and the cellist from my aunt’s porch appeared in the doorway because of course she did and she did the oldest trick, which is to make the noise into a pattern your body can carry. Slate swore and then cried and then swore about crying. Deke held a handful of rags and looked like a saint because saints are just people who do something with their faces at the right time of evening. Eleanor Prism walked through the lobby laughing because it was ridiculous and dangerous and hers. Leda shouted about sugar and men threw their vinegar away into a sink labeled Greywater and the pipes did not complain. I held the ladle and my hand stung and I thought about the story Salome had told me about the road that kinked because someone fed the cutters soup.

Afterward, because there is always an afterward and it is always the part we will not document well enough, we sat under the plaques that said Rest is Work and drank tea that had lost its heat. We did not become good. We did not become forgiven. We did not fix anything you can photograph. We made a noise that was not what we expected and we did not die of it. Deke leaned his head on my shoulder for one minute like a boy who had stood at the edge of an idea and become tired. I texted my aunt and said, We poured it out. She texted back, Wash your hands. Then: You can come get the logs whenever. Then: If they arrest you, call Iris, she is terrifying.

On the news at two in the morning, a camera showed the lobby and the birds and the vests and the cups. The caption said: Disruption at Kestrel Becomes Community Care Event. Voices off-screen called it performative. The comments said it was performative. I had no argument for that except to say that we had performed and felt the stage under our feet and realized it was a floor and were embarrassed enough to stand up straighter. Wrought posted a paragraph that started with, “Please do not confuse theater with force,” and ended with, “Boys will have to relearn teeth.” He had printed flyers by morning. He had a room with a bad printer to go back to. He had pacing to do and he would do it until he wore a groove.

I slept for two hours and woke with my mouth tasting like lemon and pride and some small shame that felt like a cousin I would learn to live with. In the shower, the water stung where the vinegar had touched my wrist, and the sting felt like a blessing, like a reminder that some substances announce themselves and you have to believe them. My mother made toast and did not ask and cut the crusts off because she loves to do it even if I’m too old and then put the crusts in a bowl for the imaginary ducks we feed by eating our own crusts later. On my way out, she said, “You smell like soup,” and I said, “I am soup,” and she said, “That explains the steam,” and kissed the side of my head with a mouth full of toothpaste.

At school, Ms. Lai wrote in big letters on the board: Please do not confuse spectacle with change. Under it, in smaller letters: Please do not confuse change with being seen. And under that, in a hand that looked like someone else’s because she had let a student write it: Please do not confuse rigor with cruelty. I turned in my revised essay. It had forks in it. It had a ladle. It had nineteen floors of nothing. It had a boy who wanted a knife and took a kitchen instead. It had a line I knew she would circle because she can’t help herself. The line said: We will practice being harmless until it is not harmless to anyone anymore. Ms. Lai looked at it for a long time, then looked at me and did not nod, because nodding would have made it into church.

On the internet, the Ember Sons posted a new crest—a candle balanced on a spoon. People argued in the comments about whether that meant they were selling out or evolving. Deke sent me a picture of his wrist where the vinegar had caught it and raised a welt and wrote: that hurt. It’s not proof, I wrote back. It’s a souvenir. He sent three knife emojis, then a pot. He said, let’s plan something. I said, I’m going to my aunt’s to read logs. He said he’d come. I told him he’d be bored. He said he wanted to be bored. He said he wanted to see the cranes she made from receipts. He said he wanted to hear the cello in the rain.

We went after school. The wind pushed at us like a friend who loves you enough to be rude. Salome made tea and put a bowl on the table labeled For Underdeveloped Boys as if she kept such bowls for different visitors—For Women Who Need to Cry, For People Who Think They Are Philosophers, For Men Who Think They Are Knives. Deke sat on the floor and read her logs with the concentrated awe of a boy who has been given a beautifully dull thing and told it matters. He found a line about moss thick by the dock and looked up and said, softly, “This is someone’s whole life.” Salome said, “Yes,” and did not add anything because the sentence had done its job. The cello next door chased a storm out of the yard. We were harmless, which is to say we were dangerous to everything that wanted us to be worse.

When we left, Salome gave Deke a jar of jam he held like a medal he had stolen and could not admit he loved and said, “Do not eat me with this,” and he said, “I won’t,” and looked at me like I had eaten the moon. The street smelled like someone had mowed a lawn far away and the scent had gotten tired on the way to us. I decided to carry my knife and my ladle and my aunt’s logs in the same bag like a stupid toolkit. I decided to keep deciding, which felt like lifting something heavy and finding that your arms know how. I decided to stop waiting for the machine to cough and to start listening for the small sounds the moss makes when it grows over a road. I decided to tell Ms. Lai what a janitor does, with verbs. I decided to ask Eleanor Prism to come to career day and, in front of everyone, show us how to take a scarf off and make it look like you were more dangerous that way. I decided to text the number on the napkin and ask if they needed volunteers, and they did, and they scheduled me for Tuesday evenings to pour hot water into cups as if that was a service that could keep a city upright.

On the bus, a kid in a shirt with a dragon on it that was not unfashionable yet asked his mother if men were over. She said, “No, sweetheart, they’re on lunch,” and pointed at me with the tiniest tilt of her chin like: this one is carrying a tray. The city kept being itself, which is a terrible consolation and the only one we get. I put my hand in my pocket and pressed the knife down until its hinge clicked against my palm. I pressed the ladle into my thigh where the handle made a dumb bulge. I ate the jam with a spoon in my head and saved the actual jar for a morning when I thought machines were winning. I went home and did my homework like a boy with a schedule written in pencil on a piece of paper tacked above a desk with tape that had been reused until it had the memory of other walls in it. There were sirens later and there will always be sirens. There was a tiny bird on my windowsill that clicked and then stopped clicking and watched me without fear. There was a text from Wrought calling us theater and a text from Leda asking if the burn had blistered and a text from my mother that said: dinner is soup. There was everything and then there were dishes. I washed them and didn’t break a single plate, which felt like a small revolution that did not need to be televised.Chapter Five

The logs were dull the way a horizon is dull until you have walked toward it for hours and realized you were wrong about what distance does to a person. Deke spread them out on the floor in my living room like he was laying down tracks and the cat hair on the rug drifted to their edges as if it wanted to learn botany. My mother made us tea and put a plate of sliced apples between our knees and kept not asking why we were so gentle with paper that had already been kind for decades. The entries came in threes and fives, never two for some reason, as if the person who wrote them had a superstition that a day was not a day unless it had a rhythm a hand could drum. Shorthand, then the clean longhand, then a small drawing that pretended not to be sentimental. Iris’s name came up in notes in the margins where Salome had traced out who had been there when a crate surprised them by being heavier than anyone admitted, or when a storm made a sound like someone sliding their palm across a steel table. We read about spore counts and the recurrence of a lichen that had the habit of appearing in places designed to “discourage persistence,” which is a way to say the city sometimes tried to sterilize corners and the corners refused.

Deke, who had made a crest for his phone and who loved the idea of teeth, lifted his head from a page where the entry read: “Moss thick by the dock. Shouts from town. Cassie burned the stew,” and he said, in a voice I will admit I keep trying to drag out of him like rope out of a well, “You could hide in this. You could hide and come out better instead of worse.” He touched the drawing of a kettle with a handle drawn over and over because whoever had sketched it had liked the way handles insist on themselves. He put his finger on the line that said “Shouts from town,” and he said, “This is how it looks when men make a noise and women make soup and both matter and neither is enough alone,” and then he winced and said, “Sorry, that sounded like a poster,” and I wanted to kiss his forehead for hearing it.

We took the logs to school because Ms. Lai had asked me to show her what the janitor sentence looked like and because carrying something in public is a way to make a promise about it that you cannot break without an audience. Ms. Lai bent over the pages as if she were eavesdropping on a party at a neighbor’s apartment and trying to guess which season had just ended by the way the laughter shifted. She made the kind of noises teachers make when they are trying not to be moved by something old and domestic. On the board she had written: “Tell me what this looks like,” in three colors that looked like a traffic light for feeling. I drew two rectangles and labeled one The Work That Makes The Work and the other The Work. Then I wrote underneath them, in small letters, “A list taped to a door: 1) move the kinks in the hose, 2) replace the tape, 3) tape the tape if you have to.” Ms. Lai looked at me as if she were deciding whether to send me to the principal or to dinner with her favorite librarian and then she said, “Add verbs,” and walked away to fold a girl’s braid back into itself with the kind of hand that can do three things while standing still.

That afternoon, on a roof with a copper spire that made my teeth buzz if I stood under it too long, Iris met us with the air of a woman who knows how to make an entire building turn at her voice if she chooses to lower it at the right syllable. She had the sort of hair color that had happened by forgetting to care in the sun for forty years, and her scarf was not a scarf but a strip of an old sail. She carried a pair of shears that could cut a ruler in half without nicking a blade. “You are the boy who ate his aunt,” she said, not unkindly, and I realized then that the network we had been walking through was not a map but a root system and that secrets travel down if you pour a little water at the right points. “I have nothing to say about that because I was not invited. I do have mint cuttings, and the humility to tell you mint does what it wants so you will take all the credit if it survives and blame me if it dies.”

We followed her along a path of corrugated metal that sang if you stepped wrong. She spoke while she arranged things, which is to say she did not stop moving to tell us anything. She clipped and tucked and wiped the rim of a bucket with the back of her wrist and told us that wind is a habit and that you can talk to it if you remember to address its jealousies. “This city was not built by anyone with a steady hand,” she said. “It was built by people with pockets who did not want their keys to jingle. If you want a door to stick, you train it. If you want a river to slow, you give it a pantry.” She handed me a tray of mint like a deck of cards. “Take these to the nineteenth floors you love so much. The birds do not like mint; they pretend not to know what a plant is unless it’s on purpose. People will crush the leaves in their fingers and forget a stupid plan they had just long enough to hear better. That’s what I have. That and a name you can use when the people at desks are tired of pretending they don’t see you. They’re not saints. They are simply choosing a different exhaustion.”

Deke asked her about Wrought, because he wanted to understand the version of himself that had the most attention. Iris rolled her eyes in a way that could have cut paper. “There has never not been a Wrought,” she said. “He is a position, not a man. He holds a place so people who need to touch a wall find one. He will hit you with a syllabus in the dark and call it freedom. He will make you feel tall. He is not the point. The point is your hands and who gets to keep them when you are tired. Do you want to carry the ladder or kick it. Do you want to be trusted to be bored in a way that doesn’t poison the room.”

On the way down the ladder, I looked past the spires toward the three towers and thought about how architectures talk to each other across air. Kestrel had already become a story with a headline, and Matra would be next because stories are greedy and want trilogies. Deke said, “We could make Matra ring like a bell without scratching it,” and I didn’t say anything because I didn’t have the breath to argue with the boy whose mouth kept making music and trouble. Later, the Ember Sons posted a thread with the title “The Quieting at Lumen, A Plan for Dust,” and it felt like someone had written the future on a napkin and slid it under a door. They wanted to release powdered sugar into the air returns and make the sprinklers fall in love with a fantasy of winter. It was pretty if you didn’t think about mold, which is exactly how boys think when they are redrawing maps and pretending rivers like to be told where to go.

At dinner my mother gave me the ladle she had purchased like it was a small animal that would require my attention for years and said, “I signed you up for Tuesday nights with Leda. I told her you can lift five gallons and listen to a complaint without believing you have to solve a person’s life to hand them a napkin.” I asked her when she had become the sort of woman who enrolled me in gentle militias and she said, “When I grew up. It’s hideous. You’ll hate it. It works,” and tore lettuce with her bare hands as if it were a ritual she had invented.

Leda’s Tuesday nights smelled like oranges and dish soap and the good kind of tired, which is the kind that comes from finding a rhythm and keeping it until something inside you dilates enough to let sleep in later. The vests were hung on hooks by the door like a row of small consent forms. People came in looking like they had been scraped raw by their day and left with the particular face that means nothing has changed and I can breathe again. The first week I poured water until my wrist buzzed and listened to a man explain that he had been told his job was no longer a job but an arrangement and then told that his arrangement had been taken and re-arranged. He had the voice of a person who has learned to respect the bureaucracy of feelings without liking it. I did not fix him. I put another cup on the table and he cried into it a little and then thanked me as if I was a door that had been where he needed it to be at three in the morning.

Between cups, Leda taught me the little unteachable things you only learn by standing close to someone who has decided to be good at something small. She showed me the way you tilt a thermos when a line gets long so that gravity learns how to help instead of hinder. She explained how to read a crowd by the way they pick up stirrers. She told me that permits mean nothing until you make someone believe they mean everything. “There are two kinds of rules,” she said. “The ones you enforce by standing still and the ones you enforce by moving quickly. The trick is knowing which saves the night.” In between, she told me the names of the women in the vests, and every third name had a story about a cousin in trouble or a garden that had refused to grow or a train. She asked me about Wrought as if he were a new bus route everyone was annoyed about and then said, “I’ve poured tea at his meetings before they learned how to lock doors. He likes to pause. Pauses are dangerous because they sound like thought and are often just admiration of one’s own echo.”

The night of the Quieting, the Ember Sons group chat sprouted arms and grabbed at us. Slate sent maps and timings that tried to make panic look like choreography. Deke’s messages were half-fever and half-sense. My aunt texted a picture of her cat sitting in a colander with the caption, “He has decided to be pasta,” and I took it as a blessing or a warning or an excuse to breathe. I wrote to Iris because I had promised to use her name when I needed someone to put a weight on the right part of the room, and she replied, “Already on the nineteen. Bring me boys who can carry a bucket and keep their mouths shut for twenty minutes.” I told Deke I would be there and he sent a line of knives and then, apologetically, a spoon.

Lumen had a lobby that wanted to be a lake house and a haze machine that made Monday mornings look like a music video about productivity. The security guard at the desk had a crocheted blanket on her chair and the kind of gaze that makes people stop fighting. A sign near the elevators said: “This week’s learning: Impatience is a kind of fear.” The Ember Sons had planned to release their sugar from the mezzanine at the hour when stress hormones dip in people who have found a groove and want to believe in it. They had planned to tip the sprinkle into ducts and call it a baptism. I had brought a ladle and mint cuttings and Iris’s name and the part of my body that had learned how to take a shoulder in my hand and steer gently when a boy is about to choose a door he will spend a decade describing to therapists. Leda arrived like a god dressed as a small, busy woman. Eleanor sent someone not herself because you can’t fix every room by throwing yourself into it and also because she was eating dinner with a niece and had learned to keep those appointments as if they were treaties with countries with better lawyers than yours.

We split the sugar. Not into ducts, but into bowls set on tables where we had written in dry-erase marker: “Welcome to the experiment. You can put your hands in it if you want. You can not put your hands in it if you want.” Deke poured the first bowl and the air turned into a fairground memory before anyone had consented. Slate interrupted him with a hand on his wrist and I lifted the ladle and said, because someone had to say something foolish with enough conviction to make it a tool, “This is the part where theater becomes cooking,” and then we stirred. It was pretty, which meant we were in danger and also meant people came closer. Men in vests that were not our vests sniffed and smiled like dogs allowed to sit inside for once. A woman with a badge that said Facilities Supervisor in a font that looked comforting and expensive walked up and sighed and said, “Please tell me you have a permit,” and Leda lifted hers with one finger and then added, “And a plan to vacuum,” and the woman’s shoulders unhooked themselves like a bra at the end of a long day. Behind us someone turned the sprinkler system test tone to a softer pitch and the prickly part of my neck relaxed.

It would have been a triumph if we had been the kind of boys who needed triumphs, which we are not, not yet, not if I have anything to do with it. It was messy and it took a long time and a man knocked a bowl off a table with his hip and the sugar made a lake on the floor and we kept our feet under us and cleaned it with rags carried like flags. Wrought arrived late with his coat collar turned up like a charm against kindness and saw us with our hands in bowls and looked stricken in a way that made me feel he was not evil, just someone who had fallen in love with a mirror. He asked, loudly, “What is this,” and I handed him the ladle and he dropped it like an accusation. He said, “You’re defanging it,” and Leda shot back, “We are doing dentistry,” and smiled a smile that had saved people from going to prison before and would again. Slate slipped and swore and then said sorry to the floor, which is what happens when you do something embarrassing in a place where politeness has a gravity.

After the sugar came the birds, which had learned from Kestrel and took one look at the light and went back to their shelf like old men who know when a bar isn’t theirs. After the birds came three teenagers who had not been invited and had the alert eyes of kids who have realized that adults will explain anything if you let them. They watched and did not ask and then helped anyway, which is the only test I recognize. After that came a man from the Ember Sons with the kind of voice that makes rules sound like favors. He started a chant that did not fit the room and died the way a chant dies when its echo is too baffled to join. After that came a woman who had never been to Lumen and who was looking for a friend and who stood at the door for a long time reading the little signs aloud and then walked straight to our bowl and put her hand in the sugar and cried and laughed at the same time. After that came the vacuum and Iris with a bag of mint and a pair of shears. The sugar disappeared like a decision, and the mint took its place in small jars we labelled with days of the week because people like to think about what day it is when they are deciding whether to cry.

There were consequences, of course, because consequences are the only faithful thing in this city besides old women and taxis. A piece went up on a site that pretends it is a magazine when really it is a sieve for attention, arguing that the gentle engine had co-opted a protest and turned it into soup, and in the comments a boy with a photo of a wolf for an avatar wrote, “We should have stuck to blood,” and then a girl wrote, “Grow up,” and he wrote, “Never,” and I wanted to hug them both and send them bracelets with their favorite words embossed on them like allergies. Another piece went up the next morning with a headline that made it sound as if the building had hosted a craft fair, and that enraged Wrought enough that he made a video from the basement of Bluegate in which he placed his hands just outside the frame like a promise and said we had proven his point by making it easier to breathe. He wanted a room that made it harder. He wanted a future you had to sharpen yourself to enter. He wanted us to starve and call it discipline. He wanted to be right. I knew then that his devotion was to being right, and it has force, yes, but it is the wrong flavor.

When the rush had thinned and the floor had stopped pretending to be snow, we sat with our cups and our shirts stuck to our backs and our hands smelling like salad and mechanic sugar. Deke leaned back and put his feet on a chair and got a glare from a woman with a lanyard with keys that could open any door and put his feet back down without being told a second time, which is what being civilized looks like when it actually earns the name. He said, “Wrought is going to call me a traitor,” and he said it like he was trying on a shirt in a color he had avoided and discovering it did not make him disappear. He said, “You turned the scene into your thing and it worked and I hate that it worked because I loved the old scene,” and I said, “You loved the rehearsal,” and he said, “I loved the costume,” and we stared up at the feeling of a ceiling that had been doing its job for a very long time without getting any applause.

On the way home, the city breathed even though nothing had happened if you were a camera. My mother had left a bowl covered in a towel on the counter with a note that said, “If this is not soup when you lift the towel, it will be something else and that will be fine.” The towel covered a bread dough that had done its best. We pressed our fingers into it and believed in warmth. My phone pinged with a text from a number I did not have, which always makes you feel both wanted and invaded. It was my father, who had apparently decided the thing to do after your son accidentally invents a secondary career as a very mild saboteur is to come back into the story with a sentence that did not apologize and did not ask for anything, because men like to believe in a third category that gets them out of both. He wrote, “Heard you’re in the paper. Coffee?” and I stared at the word “coffee” as a proposition that didn’t hack at me with its teeth. I said yes because I am cruel to myself and because I wanted to see if his knees were still jokes or had become furniture.

We met at a place with a chalkboard sign that said “This Is Not Coffee, It’s Hope,” which is the sort of thing that would have made him laugh once. He had shaved his beard into a smaller version of a beard and his hairline had retreated with more dignity than his sense of obligation. He hugged me with that shoulder-forward male thing that is a way of touching without admitting it, and he smelled like a person who has tried three kinds of soap and still thinks he could do better. He said, “You look like your mother,” and he meant it as a compliment that might be deflected and I let it go into the air like a balloon I had no intention of delivering anywhere. He asked me about school and I told him about Ms. Lai and the way she writes so politely you feel guilty not understanding her. He asked me about Kestrel and Lumen and I told him the polite version and the impolite version and he laughed at the impolite parts and nodded at the polite parts and that was the first time I thought, you can be two men in one manufacture and some days the right one shows up and you half forgive the other for existing.

When the coffee arrived he put his fingertip on the rim of the cup and moved it back and forth like a man testing the temperature of a decision. He said, “I left because I wanted to be the kind of person who can see around a corner,” and I said, “You left because it was easier than learning to go in a straight line,” and he said, “You sound like someone who knows what a straight line is,” and I said, “I know what a line is when it is a lie,” and then we both smelled the sugar on his sleeve because he had hugged me and the bowl had been there, and he smiled a little without using the parts of his face that make it vulnerable and said, “You smell like a kitchen,” and it should not have mattered but it did. He told me about his job as if it were a person he was seeing that his friends did not love and that he knew had a good heart anyway. He told me about a woman who was not my mother and was not a threat and also was not a consolation. He told me about a therapist who made him sit in silence until he learned to hear his own jokes before I did. He did not say I’m sorry because he has never been good at that and because I would have tasted the metal on the bread and resented him for using a sacrament he had not paid for.

When I told him about Wrought he made a face I have only seen him make when he sees a man talking to a woman at a bar as if she were an instrument he could play without sheet music. “Don’t get used,” he said, and there it was, the fathering, late and wonky, creeping in sideways like ivy learning to be a ladder. “Find the room where someone laughs at the right time and sit in the back and stack chairs at the end. If the man at the front never laughs, leave. That one will ask you to believe in him over yourself and it will feel like religion because in a way it is.” He gave me a twenty folded the way men fold money when they think it’s still a talisman and I gave it back because there are rituals I am not interested in performing even if it would make the story neat. He put it in the tip jar without making a show of it and I was forced to admit he had learned one trick while he was away.

Midweek, my aunt called to say her thumb had gone red and fat where she had pricked it and I should walk with her to the clinic because she wanted to make a scene in case anyone tried to treat her without commenting on the fact that her hands were a miracle. She also wanted to keep me from sitting alone making schedules for my own heroics. The nurse at the desk wore an enamel pin that said “More Pillows, Fewer Pills,” and had the kind of voice that makes you put your phone away even if you were doing something useful with it. The doctor was very young, which is something we say because we are afraid of youth being competent. He looked at the thumb like a person in an art museum trying to puzzle out why some paint makes you feel something and why other paint does not. He told her to keep it clean and admired, aloud, the fact that she had not let it get worse out of pride. He told me to watch for red lines traveling up her arm like trains you don’t want to catch. He asked about the blood on the bread with more curiosity than judgment, and said, “The ritual did something to you,” and I said, “Yes,” and he said, “Then it worked,” and I almost reached out and patted his sleeve, because that kind of pragmatism is rare in the very young. On the way out, my aunt stopped in the gift shop to buy a ridiculous card with a lemon on it and the words “You’ve got this” because the world refuses to let a symbol die even when it has been exhausted in service of a point.

The following week at school, Ms. Lai announced we were going to have a day about labor, which made half the class think we were going to have to give birth and the other half think we would have to stack chairs for hours. She had a group of custodians come in, men and women with keys that glinted like fish in their bunches, and asked them to talk about their favorite noises. One woman said, “The sound a wheel stops making after you oil it,” and a man said, “The way a vacuum doesn’t quite sound like anything,” and another man said, “A trash bag that doesn’t whisper because it fits right,” and I fell a little in love with all of them because you can only trust people who have favorite sounds that are not your own voice. Afterward, while our classmates faked their way through sympathy for a job they had been raised to believe was for people who failed tests, I followed a custodian named Omero down to the boilers and learned what real heat is and why you should never touch a thing just because it’s glowing. He had a screwdriver he called “my second son,” and a little shrine taped behind a valve with a photo of a dog and a saint whose eyes were crossed out with tape because Omero believed in getting rid of the gaze of saints. He let me hold a piece of pipe that vibrated like a living thing and said, “Buildings are bodies, yes, but not one body. They’re a room full of bodies that have to learn how to be together without killing each other,” and I wanted to ask if that meant we should all carry wrenches, but instead I said, “Thank you,” in a voice that sounded like mine.

That night the Ember Sons chat degenerated into a fight about whether spoons are complicit, which sounds like a joke until you are in the room and a boy with a shave that makes his skin look like a ballet thinks he has found a lever and you realize you are going to have to decide whether to make fun of him or tell him to go to bed. Wrought posted a schedule with a “Cut” planned for the next week at Matra, proposed as a clean severing of the “leashful lanyard logic” of the lower floors by knocking out the badge system for a day. It would trap people in places where they would have to talk, which is the kind of coercion men like to call natural. I wrote to Iris and she sent back, “Please do not break my elevators. They are my hobby. Tell your poet to go read to ducks,” and then, in a separate message like a benediction, “Come help us clean the filters on Eight.”

On Eight, the filters were a felt that had learned shame. We wore masks and said sentences that had numbers in them and took breaks to stare at a poster that said, “This is not nothing,” over a picture of a hand putting a cup in a sink. Deke came and I watched him learn how to unfasten a thing without hurting it and it almost broke my heart because people do not praise boys for this enough and then they wonder why boys like Wrought. We worked until our spines sounded like accordions and then sat on the floor and let our heads fall onto our knees. Iris brought us orange slices like we were seven after a soccer game and we ate them as if they were complicated. We watched the weekend staff arrive with babies balanced on their hips because childcare at Matra had won a fight with two budgets and four old men and decided never to be polite again. Eleanor came by because she is a person who is incapable of staying away from a place where filters are being changed and said, “If the badge system goes down, we’ll open the doors and count heads by hand. It will take longer. It will be funny. Your poet won’t have the drama he wants. He’ll go somewhere else to find it,” and then she smoothed a wrinkle in a poster about stairs and said, “It is frustrating how easy it is to make a terrible thing into a joke if you have forty women and an email list.”

Wrought moved the location of the Cut three times because someone had told him he was predictable and nothing terrifies a preacher more than becoming routine. In the end he settled on the library because he wanted to prove he did not fear rules that existed for good reasons. We went, not to stop him because there are men you cannot stop without becoming him, but to be there when the thing he planned turned into something else. The library had a new piece of software that whispered to you when you were about to forget to stand up and a row of plants so carefully humble it made me laugh and then apologize to the plants. Wrought stood in the entry and announced we were not going to cooperate with the system and then handed out a set of printed cards with instructions on how to give each other permission to do exactly what the system wanted us to do, and everyone in the room discovered that theater is not just ours and began to play. Elderly men asked shy students for consent to borrow chairs and people who had never spoken out loud in that room before read poems they had not written about doors. It was ridiculous and we were in love with it and Wrought was furious and Deke put his hand on my shoulder as if to say, it’s not that you were right, it’s that this room wanted to be this anyway and you thought to ask it.

After that day, the Ember Sons became two groups that were still convinced they were one. There were boys who wanted the basement and boys who wanted the nineteenth floor, and they argued at midnight about whether sugar had betrayed blood and whether teeth had anything to do with soup. Wrought made another room with a worse printer and the rest of us went to Omero’s boiler and cleaned the lint screen and marveled at the way heat obeys when spoken to it in the tone reserved for stubborn animals. I brought the ladle everywhere like a joke that kept growing teeth and found myself tempted into rituals more complex than I had planned: a drop of vinegar at the threshold of Matra to keep away the idea that we were holy, a sprig of mint under a poster about metrics to remind us not to drown in numbers that love themselves too much, a bread heel tucked behind the radiator in my room for the mouse I had never seen and thus could love.

There was a night when I came home and my mother was not there at the hour when she is always there scolding the dishwasher into closing. I sat on the kitchen floor and learned that panic has a temperature, which is different from the temperature of the room. Then she came in with a plastic bag full of limes and her shoes in her hand and said, “I saw a movie by myself,” and I cried because she had saved the world and I hadn’t noticed and I had also saved nothing that day and she kissed my forehead and then scolded me for not having eaten something on schedule. She said, “If your little club asks you to give them your calendar, tell them no,” which is maybe the most radical thing anyone has taught me and I am trying not to forget it.

At school, the petition about the atrium plants going to seed became a referendum on whether chaos was sexy and half the student government tried to co-opt it and the other half tried to kill it with procedure and Ms. Lai wrote the words “mess” and “maintenance” on the board and drew a line between them that had a kink in it, which she apologized for and then refused to correct. We held a vote under the ferns and then ignored the vote because it was obviously wrong in a way that made me understand governance in a way that was more useful than any video. Three days later, the plants had twelve more flowers and a small sign appeared that read, “This is not a precedent.” Someone had crossed out “not” and someone had crossed out the crossing out and then someone had made a small drawing of a lemon and we all went about our lives because you cannot live in a referendum and not become a slogan.

The night before the planned Cut-that-was-not, I dreamed of a room with no doors where all the men I had ever admired were standing around trying to remember how to sit on the floor. They put their knees up and their arms around their knees and their faces did that thing men’s faces do when they are being careful in case someone is filming. In the dream I walked around them with a tray of cups and a ladle and every time I tried to hand one a cup he shook his head and pointed at his mouth like a child who doesn’t know how to say water yet, and then Iris walked in and said, “You cannot help people who have turned refusal into a personality. Offer anyway,” and I woke up sweating and made tea like a man who had been given an assignment by a god he did not believe in and did not want to disappoint.

I do not know if any of this is enough. I am not interested in enough anymore because enough is a number and numbers walk into rooms like they own them. What I know is that the day after the library we went to my aunt’s and Deke asked to tie the string for the cranes and Salome taught him in two moves how to make the corners admit they were corners and not ideas of corners, and he failed and then he did not and he held up a crane that looked like a bird that had changed its mind and we applauded as if we had just seen a trick that will never be pulled off again, and maybe that was true. When it was time to leave she put jars into our hands without asking if we could carry them because she knows who we are and believes we can figure out weight. On the porch the cello was practicing the kind of song you play when you do not think anyone is listening, which is to say the best kind. Deke said he wanted to be bored more, and I said I knew a boiler that needed dusting, and he said, “That sounds like theater,” and I said, “Good,” and he said, “Good,” and for a second our faces were the right faces for the world we were in even if the world didn’t deserve them.

On the train home, a man stood up and apologized for taking up space with his body. He did not need to apologize, and the woman next to him said so by touching his sleeve, and he cried the quiet kind of crying that makes you want to stand in front of a building with your arms out in case the wind has gotten meaner since you were twelve. I went home and washed dishes and watched through the window a neighbor teaching their kid how to ride a bike without pitching forward in fear. The kid went into the street as if the street had been made for that, and I had to sit down because sometimes the city remembers what it is for. In the morning, I brought the mint to the nineteenth floor and Deke brought the sugar to Leda’s sink and Wrought brought his fury to a room with a door that sticks and we all did our little jobs. I am not brave. I am not coward. I am something like a janitor with a knife and a ladle and an aunt and a teacher who keeps writing verbs on the board with her small careful hand. I keep waiting for a machine to cough and sometimes I think I hear it at the edge of sleep and then I wake and it is the radiator or my own mean brain, and I make tea and stir and go to the room where nothing happens and stand still and wait for someone to need a cup.Chapter Seven started with a leak that wasn’t a leak so much as a decision the ceiling had made about gravity. It was the kind of damp that turns paint contemplative. Omero called it “a weep,” which was kinder and more accurate, and he showed me how to listen with the palm, not the ear, for tremor instead of drama. The water found the seam above the hall outside Ms. Lai’s room and printed a Rorschach that looked like a dove if you wanted it to and like a hand if you were in a mood. Ms. Lai, who insists on the world being literal so that metaphors have something to push against, set a bin under it and wrote on an index card: “This is not the worst thing.” She taped it to the bin and went back to teaching compound sentences as if punctuation could keep us from making the kind of choices that don’t fit in parentheses.

The Ember Sons had split like yeast in warm water. Wrought kept the basement with the printer that ate verbs and spit out nouns with teeth. The rest of us found ourselves in rooms with windows that opened a polite amount and in lobbies that practiced how to be public without breaking. Deke had taken to carrying a rag in his pocket like a talisman, which would have been funny if it weren’t also a little beautiful. He wiped the rims of cups without thinking about it and only realized what he was doing when Leda watched him and handed him a second rag so he wouldn’t have to choose between dirty and dirtier. He was still lit by something that wanted to be fire, but it flickered now when confronted with tea. I tell myself that’s growth and not fatigue, and perhaps for once I am right.

My father texted me after midnight with a photo of a stool he had built that was three-legged in the way a promise is three-legged: technically stable, secretly wobbly. He wanted me to sit on it and tell him if he had gotten better at weight distribution since he left a house that had needed him to know how. I typed back that I would, and then did not sleep because my brain decided it was a good night to list all the things I had done on purpose and all the things that had occurred anyway. In the morning, the city’s face looked puffy with sleep, softened at the edges by fog rolling down from North Slope like someone had decided to condition the air. People on the bus were gentler in fog, like voices in a kitchen after midnight. It felt like the day had taken a bowl in both hands and was asking us to speak into it.

There was word of an Audit. Not the cruel kind with spreadsheets like guillotines, but the kind the towers did when they wanted to prove to themselves that their kindnesses were not decorations. They called it Sift Day. The three towers would open twenty-one doors each that no one ever saw and invite anyone to watch how the quiet was maintained, how air was coaxed into being breathable, how alarms were taught not to panic. Iris told us in a tone that made me stand up straighter that Sift Day was the most vulnerable day of the quarter because it invited people who were bored to become gods. Eleanor posted a video in which she took off her scarf and held it like a flag and said, “Please do not confuse transparency with confession. We will show you the pipes, not our bones. We will show you bones another day.” Wrought posted his own with a black background and a voice softened to a whisper, asking whether we were going to allow the gentle engine to domesticate even our rebellions. He wanted us to come with pocketfuls of sand and turn valves until something important remembered how to scream.

I went to Salome’s to borrow a sweater because fog is a liar. She was trimming thyme with the gravity of a judge condemning a very small crime to time served. The cat had discovered a new corner to glare from. She had a cut on her forearm she refused to explain, which meant it was either something so ordinary it would make me yawn or something so stupid it would make me argue about ladders. I told her about Sift Day. She nodded with that small, private smile she wears when the city is about to play at honesty. “Bring a pencil,” she said, and the way she said it made me check my pockets for a pencil I had not packed. “People behave better when they think you will write them down. People behave worse when you think you will remember without writing. Offer them the mercy of being recorded.”

Ms. Lai turned Sift Day into homework with the shamelessness of a poet who has accepted tenure. She gave us little books the size of palms and said we would get extra credit if we wrote down three things that looked like lies and three things that looked like work. She told us to look for places where kindness had a schedule and to ask the person holding the schedule how they kept it from feeling like a choke. She asked us to come back with three verbs we had never used before in school. “Do not bring me desire,” she said, smiling like what she wanted was plain and what she would get was not. “Bring me maintenance.”

Kestrel’s nineteen floor looked like a hospital for plants had married a nap room. Leda had set up a hydration post like a punch bowl at a wedding where everyone was already married to exhaustion. The birds were quiet in a way that felt chosen. Men and women in vests explained how the sprinklers recognized smoke that meant unplanned burning and how it differed from theatrical fog. A child stuck her hand under a faucet and shrieked because the water came out warmer than she expected, and her mother laughed with the kind of relief you only get when a scare turns out to have been designed by someone who anticipated something besides peril. I watched a maintenance worker adjust a sensor like he was tuning a violin, tilting his head to hear a frequency that lived in the corner of a room no one visited on purpose. He had a tattoo of a wrench on his wrist that was so precise it made my fingers ache.

We lost Deke for twenty minutes and found him staring into the gut of an air handler with the reverence of a pilgrim in front of a relic that turned out to be an elbow. “It’s gorgeous,” he said, and the word came out of his mouth like someone else had taught it to him. Iris introduced him to a woman from Matra who ran the filter schedule and he tried to flirt with her using the phrase “differential pressure” in a sentence that would have been unforgivable if it had not been so sincere. She arched an eyebrow and then taught him how to slide a cassette out without smothering himself in lint as if she had decided to be kind to this new species of boy, which is to say, an older species of boy, learning to carry.

There is always a moment on days like this when the room you love betrays you. In the middle of the third tour, the alarm stuttered—not a true alarm, but a shudder like an instrument remembering a trauma. People looked up with the unanimity of fish. The birds made bell feet without moving. The tour guides smiled the way people smile when a toddler falls and might cry. Leda glanced at the ceiling with the calculation of a woman inventorying exits. The sound passed. We breathed. A woman next to me said, as if narrating a final exam answer to her own future, “I did not panic because the room did not panic,” and wrote something down on the little card they had given her at the door that read, “Notice things.”

Wrought made his move at Lumen, because of course he did. The plan was nothing as pretty as sugar and nothing as dramatic as blood. He had chosen to sabotage the clock system, a choice that was either poetic or pathetic depending on how much sleep you had had the night before. The rumor washed through the soft architecture like a rumor does: quickly, inaccurately, true enough to be useful. He and his boys—not all boys, not all his—would unplug time. Employees would emerge from meetings into a lobby where the hour had forgotten itself. Elevators would refuse to remember what button meant what. People would call their mothers at noon thinking it was nearly night. He wanted to prove that care was a spell that only worked when synchronized, and that any kindness owed you a schedule.

We went because we go where there are wrong ideas with open doors. I had mint cuttings in a tray like playing cards. I had Leda and three vests and a ladle that had become, absurdly, something I would have grabbed if the building were on fire. Iris sent a text that said only: “On my way. Bring pencils.” Eleanor, the kind of leader who hates to make a calendar bleed, stayed at Kestrel to hold a hand if a hand needed to be held. She sent someone with a scarf she had worn yesterday and a permit we did not need because what we were going to do would look like nothing until it didn’t.

Lumen’s lobby had the shined patience of a museum for the trivial miracles. A sign near the desk said: “Sift Day, nothing expected of you,” and someone had added, “Ever,” in pencil and someone else had erased it and added, “Sometimes,” and it felt like a conversation you could live with. The clock over the desk had been turned to face the wall as if it were being punished. Wrought stood near the mezzanine rail with his back very straight, the posture of someone who believes in arteries. He had a little crew of narrowly shaved boys and broadly bearded men and two women in boots that made a noise you remember, and he was holding a cable like a snake he had charmed. He looked up at the ceiling as if telepathy were a plan. He saw me and made a face that was not contempt or love. He looked like a person holding an apology he didn’t know how to spend.

“Time,” he said, loud enough to bounce, “is the leash,” and I almost admired him for choosing a metaphor with teeth. “Today we cut it and see who still knows how to walk.”

I wanted to stand on a chair and talk about bread. Instead I walked to the woman at the desk and asked, “If the clock goes, what happens to the sprinklers,” because I am learning to phrase my resistance in logistics. She smiled in that way you respect when you’re about to break a rule and she chooses not to see you. “They don’t care,” she said. “Fire has its own hours.” She offered me a handful of paper clips like holy medals and pulled out a sheet labelled Incident Template, which I swear is the sexiest thing I have ever seen because it means someone else has done the favor of planning for your worst day.

The thing about a clock is that it is not one clock. There are little ones embedded like seeds, there are big ones that make an announcement of themselves, there are soft ones in brains that misread each other when panic enters the room. Wrought and his men unhooked what they could reach and called it victory. The lobby paused. The sound system made a hiccup like an apology. A child climbing on a couch laughed because his body only knows three times: now, later, and never. The mechanical birds looked at each other with their bell-feet and one trilled out of turn and then pretended not to have. People drifted to the desk, then away, like a tide that refuses to be scheduled by the moon.

Iris arrived with a coil of coax and a basket of clothespins as if she had gotten the call that time was slipping and decided to hang it up to dry. She walked past Wrought without letting his words land on her and climbed the mezzanine stairs with a grace that made the metal less embarrassed. She handed out pencils and told people to write down exactly what their bodies thought the time was. “Don’t look at your phone,” she said, “unless you need it to call a nurse.” People wrote 10:15 and 1:00 and Friday and Once, which told me everything I needed to know about us. She clipped the cards to a line she strung between two pillars and the lobby filled with this ridiculous laundry of guesses. “There,” she said, tying a square knot with a tension that would hold, “now the hour is visible.”

Wrought opened his mouth to make a point and Leda stepped into the space between him and the nearest set of ears with a thermos and a plastic spoon. “You don’t get to own silence,” she told him companionably, as if they had planned this. “It’s a commons.”

Deke stood at the base of the mezzanine looking up at Wrought like a son at a father who keeps changing his name. He had one hand on the rail, the other on the rag in his pocket, which made him look like a person negotiating with himself about what he will put down first. He caught my eye and I could see the motion of his thoughts like a fish under a dock. He is not mine to save, but I will claim the work of being near.

The strangest thing happened then, which is that nothing happened. The elevators did not soften. The emergency lights stayed at their chosen glow. A meeting let out and people saw the time turned upside down and chose, unanimously and absurdly, to sit on the floor together and count to sixty twice, which is not how minutes work but felt like it should be. The lobby hummed like a mouth filled with sugar. Wrought pulled a plug that should not have pulled and an outlet that had been waiting politely sparked like a small animal on a dry rug. The spark startled him less than it startled the boy with the camera behind him, and I think about that boy sometimes still, whose footage we will never see because he put the phone in his pocket and used both hands to make sure his friend didn’t fall backwards into a chair.

The clock at the desk remained facing the wall. The woman with the nametag that said T lifted it like a scolded child and set it down sideways like a painting being considered for a new spot. Above us, on the nineteenth floor, a sign lit: Rest. The birds trilled in a key that made my teeth feel organized. Iris called down from the mezzanine that she would need tape and someone handed her tape in a relay that felt like a religious practice. I set the mint out on the tables and people crushed leaves and rubbed the scent on their wrists like a ritual against bad hours. Leda lined up cups. We breathed in. We breathed out. Wrought stood very still and I saw the failure sit on his shoulder like a cat who didn’t like him but liked his heat. He could have laughed and joined us and I think his life might have turned then, but he did not. He maintained his posture the way a person maintains a story long after it stops feeding him.

Later, after we had faced the clock and let it face us and convinced the room that minutes were no danger, I found Wrought by the automatic doors negotiating with the air. He looked like he had come from underwater. He watched me watch him and softened exactly the way a man does when he notices he is being seen as a person and not a structure. “You made a carnival,” he said, not accusingly, but not with approval. “You made time into kindergarten.”

“We let the hour be boring,” I said, because there are days when I can speak plain. “You wanted fear. We didn’t let you have it. That’s all.”

He laughed once without letting it get to his eyes. “You’re going to keep them safe until they can’t fight,” he said, and said it like a curse and a benediction. “You’re going to lull them into a life where waking is an insult.”

“I’m going to keep the sprinklers from thinking fog is trouble,” I said, because I am cruel to metaphors that want to be dictators. “And then I’m going to go home and make soup like a peasant and sleep like a rock and wake up like a boy and go to school and write verbs for a woman who deserves them.”

He wanted to be angry at that but his body wouldn’t let him because bodies understand soup. He nodded once and slipped away into a lobby that didn’t love him and didn’t hate him and would have given him a cup if he had asked.

We went back to Matra because the filters on Eight never stop wanting. Omero was there with a plastic bag full of bolts and a box of donuts that had sweated under their lid. He had a new sticker on his cart that said: “This is not nothing,” because Ms. Lai’s index cards have a way of leaving their natural habitat. Deke made himself useful without announcing it and when he dropped a screw he made the small sound you make when you have learned not to curse in rooms where other people are trying to concentrate. Iris gave me a look that said, “You are making the right kind of mistake,” which is the highest praise I know how to want.

That evening, my father had me sit on the stool. It held me, and then it didn’t, and then it did again as if it had decided who I was. He laughed with his whole face and said, “I never learned the trick of sandpapering between coats,” and I said, “You never learned to stop calling work a trick,” and he took the sentence like a man who has finally signed for a package that kept being redelivered. We fixed the wobble with the kind of attention you give a baby’s head and he asked me, hesitating, if I would teach him how to make soup so bad it would be better next time. We stood at the stove with a noise like argument and cut an onion, which is the only way I know how to forgive a man who left is to make his eyes water and then hand him a towel.

At school, Ms. Lai collected the little books with our Sift Day notes and read a few aloud with the permission we had granted with our eyes. There was one where a girl had written: “The woman at the desk knew my name without looking, which means they keep lists of us, which I both love and fear.” There was one where a boy had written: “I touched the pipe and it hummed like a cat I did not deserve.” There was one where someone had written: “They let me sit without folding my legs the right way and no one told me my body was wrong,” and the room felt like a bowl of something steaming. Ms. Lai wrote three new verbs on the board: decant, poise, unjam. She handed my book back and had underlined a line where I wrote: “We are practicing boring heroics,” and in the margin she had written: “Yes.”

The Ember Sons chat looked like a field after a rain: trampled in ways you can map. Some boys left for other rooms with worse printers. Some boys stayed and started arguing about solvent and soil. Deke posted a picture of his rag folded in his pocket and a poem he had written that was bad in the right way, which is to say it had a wrench in it and a heart and a comma in a place where it did not belong but wanted to. Wrought sent a link to an essay about teeth and civilization and boys replied with pictures of hands holding cups. I muted the thread for an hour for the first time since I had joined and the silence felt like a good violence.

In the evening, Leda had me try the Tuesday rounds without her. Not alone, just in front. “You will hate being watched,” she said, “and then you will forget you are being watched,” and that turned out to be the entire secret of both maintenance and adolescence. I spilled once and a woman with a lanyard on loan wiped the spill before I could reach it, and the grace of that made me stand up straight as if posture could repay debts. A man told me his daughter had started asking if he had taken water that day and he didn’t want to lie to her so he took water even when he didn’t want it, and I told him I took soup for my aunt even when I was angry because longing is a lousy diet. He nodded like I had said something intelligent and I managed not to correct him.

I went to visit the cello woman, because there are debts with no due date. She sat on the porch with her instrument in her lap like a large child and the bow on her shoulder like a blessing. She did not ask who I was because she knew in the way people know who lives in the houses next to theirs when everything is mostly fine. She played a piece I did not recognize and then told me it was something she made up when her son’s bus is late and she needs to keep her hands busy. “It’s the waiting,” she said, laughing without apology. “It’s always the waiting,” and I wanted to tell her that she had solved a part of life I keep poking at with expensive pencils. I asked her how long she played and she said, “Exactly as long as it takes for the first person to stop looking out the window for the bus and go sit down,” and that felt like a working definition of art.

There was a night when the wind kicked and the power browned like a person changing their mind. The soft city turned its head and showed a hard angle. My mother and I walked the hall checking on neighbors like we had been trained by poster campaigns and childhood. The woman at the end of the hall who never spoke let us in and showed us her drawer full of candles organized by scent, and I realized I had never considered what it looked like when a life chose lavender as a weapon. We lit four and the room became a chapel for a god I could believe in: small flames doing their job with no promise of applause. I fixed a breaker I had no business touching because Omero had taught me enough to be dangerous and also enough to be safe. After, my mother and I ate toast in the kitchen in our coats because you should eat something when the world shows you its teeth.

The next morning, Eleanor had posted a note on the glass of Kestrel like she was taping a sign to her own forehead: “We failed you for twenty minutes. We practiced what to do next. Thank you for not making a joke we couldn’t bear.” In the comments, a boy with a wolf icon had written, “You’ll be sorry when a real storm comes,” and a girl had written, “A storm is a kind of maintenance,” and a man had written, “We know,” and I put my phone in my pocket like a bad tool and went to work.

Salome sent me to the store for flour and the clerk, who knows me as the boy who buys lemons, asked if I was the one who had put mint on the nineteenth and I said yes and he said thank you, and I said it was not mine and he said that was the point. I bought two bags of flour because carrying weight on purpose is how you prove to your body that you earned your dinner. When I got back, she had written on her list: “Things That Make It Bearable, number twenty-four: finding the right screw without looking,” and I added twenty-five: “adding to someone else’s list,” and she didn't cross it out, which is how you know permission when you see it.

I do not know when Chapter Seven ends in a life. It doesn’t close like a book; it recedes like fog. What I know is that the day after we faced the clock, Ms. Lai added a new sentence to the board under all the “Please do not confuse—” liturgies. She wrote: “Please do not confuse ease with mercy,” and she underlined mercy until the chalk crumbled and she laughed at herself and blew the dust off her fingers and corrected the underline with her fingertip. We sat still and did not clap because the hour did not ask for applause, and somewhere, on a porch, a cello told the rain it could be music if it tried, and in a basement a bad printer chewed the corner off a manifesto and no one cried about it, and on a nineteenth floor the mint remembered what it was for without our help. I put my knife in my pocket and my ladle in my bag and my pencil behind my ear and went to the boiler to see if heat had remembered us. It had. It always does if you listen with your palm.Chapter Nine

The week announced itself with a hinge that would not shut up about its job. The door to the copy room began to squeal each time it remembered it was a door, the kind of noise that makes teachers close their eyes in prayer and teenagers say they will fix it someday without meaning it. I carried a little bottle of oil from Omero like a saint smuggling relics and taught myself again how to be patient with screws that refuse to turn until they are warmed by conversation. Ms. Lai put up a card that said, “This is not a crisis,” and under it another that said, “It is also not nothing,” because she can’t resist fairness even when the stakes are the size of a hinge. The door considered our case and quieted down as if it had been heard in a way it could accept. It felt like a small treaty with physics, the kind that holds until the weather remembers its temperament.

Flyers for the Night of Edges appeared in boys’ bathrooms and on the underside of cafeteria tables where gum has been building kingdoms for years. Someone had used a good printer for once and a font that wanted to be a throat. The flyer called for a citywide refusal to let time and schedules and emails count as proof that we exist. It listed five places “to make a cut visible,” including the transit control for the river trams, the badge readers at Matra’s west door, a clinic’s appointment board, an egg timer in a bakery, and a school bell system “so we learn to be our own alarm.” The list had the pride of a plan that has never been made to put on shoes. Deke stared at it a long time and tried to laugh and it did not quite come out. He said Wrought was getting sloppy with romance. I said sloppiness is a gateway to cruelty, and he put the flyer in his pocket like something he would give back to the city with a note pinned to it that said, “Sorry, misplaced.”

Salome decided we were going to the tool library because she had noticed a draft where there had never been a draft and preferred screws to superstition. The tool library smelled like ferrous patience and people who insist on returning things. A woman with a name tag that read BESS in a hand so decisive it made me want to spell my name better explained the rules with the bored precision of someone who has caught three generations lying about deadlines and forgiven them anyway. Salome checked out a torque wrench like she had won a battering ram in a raffle and a coil of poly rope that remembered other knots. I found a section labeled Oddities and lifted a clamp shaped like a yearning hand. Bess saw me and said I could borrow it if I promised not to use it on people. Salome leaned on the counter and asked after Bess’s granddaughter as if she had personally invented the child. Their voices braided into a net and for a moment I understood that this is the opposite of secrecy: it is a network of women who remember each other's errands across winters.

At school the Rigor Fair pinned itself to the gym with a thousand binder clips. Tables showed off projects that were all verbs: mend, unjam, brace, weatherstrip, swale. Ms. Lai made me write our sign in letters that admitted to their errors. We called our table Boring Heroics and arranged mint cuttings beside diagrams of filter cassettes like a florist had fallen in love with HVAC. Deke stood there with a rag folded in his palm and explained to men with boy bodies how to unfurl a rag without shaming it for being wrinkled. A girl from the sophomore class, Tamsin, brought a jar of screws organized by mood with labels like “contrite,” “opinionated,” and “finally,” and I put three in my pocket as if luck could be threaded. Ms. Lai tried to walk by without inducting herself into our cult of maintenance and failed. She leaned on the table and said, “Tell me what this looks like,” for the sixtieth time that month, and for once I did not answer with a sentence. I handed her the ladle. She laughed at herself and held it like a baton until her face remembered too much and then set it down gently, as if anything requires a witness to be put down properly.

The storm came like a rumor that turned true when nobody was ready to stop telling it. The air thickened until the city’s sound became soup, and then the first clap made windows flinch. The long line of roofs visible from our kitchen took on that soaked felt look that means you should pull the couch away from the wall and make a pile of towels just in case. North Slope went pale on the horizon like a bruise admitting itself. My mother dug out candles in the way some women reach for scarves, choosing with a seriousness that makes you love them more. Omero texted a picture of a boiler eye growing worried and wrote: “You hear it too, right,” and I did, in my hands, in my teeth, in my urge to inventory ladles. When the rain went horizontal, the city switched over to a different grammar and told us to stop using the future simple.

Wrought posted a video from the belly of a substation that shouldn’t have been accessible to poets. He said the Night of Edges couldn’t have asked for a better choir. He said systems reveal themselves under strain and that devotion looks best in lightning. He said the phrase “purifying crisis,” and I said a bad word, which I try not to do since my aunt will hear it from three blocks away. Deke did not answer my text, which is a sentence that can ruin a dozen dinners. Then he did. He wrote: “He wants to trip a breaker chain on the west river tram bank. Says ‘allow the city to admit its dependency.’ I’m probably in over my head. Bring a bucket.” He added a knife emoji and then took it back and sent a spoon, which is our entire theology.

We took what we had. Iris met us at the tram control, hair under a cap, face set in that concentrated mercy that keeps buildings from doing their worst when they are frightened. Leda distributed vests like penance and a pack of clear plastic ponchos that turned us into an army of thoughtful shower curtains. Omero arrived with tools and a curse for the man who had designed a panel to look like a cabinet. A man from the city who had never sweated in front of men who weren’t on a team started trying to speak for the weather, realized he didn’t know the words, and decided to hand us the keys instead. Deke appeared soaked and a little scared and did not pretend he had been brave in a way that would have made him handsome. He took my wrist and put my hand on a live panel not to shock me but to make sure I felt what he had felt moments before when Wrought had stood there praising the hum like it was a hymn. He smelled like a boy who had just realized wind can be a bully and a teacher.

The west bank had already taken on water in the petulant way it does when a storm throws all its weight at the angle of the river. The control room talked in three colors, none of which I speak natively. Iris does. She said words like “isolate” and “throttle” and “float,” and then turned to us and translated into boy: “We are going to keep the thing from thinking it has to sacrifice one of its arms to keep the rest dry.” Leda set up a table under an awning and poured tea that tried to steam despite the air deciding it was already done with that. Deke told me Wrought had left to find a worse idea because the room had chosen prudence, and I wanted to hug every worker who had simply given him the look we reserve for men who try to supervise the rain. We braced the panel doors against blowing and tied a tarp where a tarp didn’t want to be tied. Omero did that magician trick where you say the wrong sized wrench out loud and the right one appears in your hand because you have trained your eyes to forgive numbers under stress.

Then someone yelled about sandbags because yelling is the cheapest way to get a plan. The city’s van was backed into an intersection that had suddenly remembered it had always been a pond. North Slope leaned its elbow harder on the wind. I ran because some assignments to be a mammal come with speed. The hardware store on Walnut had one gate half down and a sign that said Closed Due To Intention. Inside, the lights were out and the piles of buckets looked like a philosophy. I banged and then banged again and then took the knife out of my pocket because sometimes the right thing has a blade. The gate yielded to a human committed to being shameless, which is not a crime in storms. I left a note in my stiffest hand on the counter that said “Borrowed twelve sandbags and a scoop. Hourly. —N.” I came out feeling like a thief being chaperoned by a parish. A couple I had seen once under the ferns held open the van door and pretended I was a hero because we needed the story to stay upright until the bags made gravity stand in the right places.

Back at the bank, people we had not assigned jobs to had assigned themselves jobs. A woman in a sundress that was now a stormdress directed the line like a conductor rehearsaling a rescue. An older man with hands that had learned once to tie ropes that matter made sure the bags did not sag in the corners. A kid with a dragon shirt held a flashlight like a prayer and swore under his breath every time the light stuttered and nobody corrected him because sometimes the sacred words are all the words you have. We built a low brown wall that wasn’t a wall so much as an argument with water. It held because the water chose to be reasonable in that one small place and because we were willing to stand there until it changed its mind.

Wrought sent a photograph of himself standing under an overpass where the storm made thunder ideas. He was soaked and beautiful in the way that tempts boys to join, because being wet is a kind of costume. He shook a chain that did not belong to him and shouted about leashes even though no one could hear him. Leda texted me a picture of her thermos instead, and it was the most erotic thing I have ever seen because it was a vessel of decisions that nobody would choose if they wanted applause. Eleanor sent three words I will keep on a scrap of paper tucked into my spine: “You are enough,” and added four more to save me from swallowing: “So is everyone else.”

Salome called in the middle of it all to tell me her window had decided to be an ocean and she was thinking of becoming a fish. Her voice was steady in the way people’s voices are steady when the thing is not the thing yet. I heard the cello in the background doing the kind of scratch you do when you are telling rain you will not give up your spot on the porch. She said she had a leak quilted into submission and would like to know whether the city was planning to stay where it was or go somewhere else entirely. I told her the river was pretending to remember a path it had not taken since before women taught it manners. I told her to put a towel where the window and the sill argued. I told her I would come if something insisted on being an emergency at her address. She grunted because she hates promises she hasn’t extracted herself and hung up on me to go do something a plant would approve of.

We held the line until there was no line, just a sense that the room had decided it would rather be a room. The breakers stayed faithless only where they had already committed to being that way. Iris taught two men to breathe in count with the lights, which sounds like nonsense until you have seen it work. Deke swore, then apologized to the panel when he bumped it with his hip, and Leda raised an eyebrow at the apology and then smiled because that might save us when nothing else does. Wrought was trending in two side rooms of the internet and losing ground in our room, which is the only map I trust.

When I finally made it to North Slope the next morning, after the rain had finished its argument and left our faces stupid with relief, Salome’s house was drying itself with the cunning of an animal. She had bowls lined up like a choir, each catching a patient drip. She had written “bearable” on the wall and erased it and written “annoying” and left it to wait. The cat had decided the bathtub was a fort. She had a cut on her forearm bandaged in a way that made me promise to check it again in an hour without being asked. She handed me a pan of screws that had been soaking in vinegar and said to shake them until they forgot they had ever been married to rust. We shook them like maracas in a room that had learned three new leaks overnight and she told me about lying awake counting the creaks of a building that insists it is still growing when really it is remembering. She said, “We got the wrong storm,” and then laughed because she is smarter than her own drama and amended, “No, we got the only storm, which is the kind that helps you find all the places you lied about sealing.”

The cello woman folded her music away with the reverence of someone who has learned to put an instrument down properly. She came over with a thermos and a bag full of something heavy and sweet. She came in like she had been invited in a lifetime ago and we had simply forgotten to tell her she could stop knocking. She sat, put her bow on the table, and unloaded eight scones with the kind of gravity you reserve for meat at the end of a siege. We ate and chewed and did not pretend food is anything but a god we invented to keep ourselves from killing each other when we are tired. The cat tried to baptize himself in the tea and we saved him and he pretended we had humiliated him beyond repair. We talked about the way the street smelled now, how you can learn what your neighbors keep in their basements by the scent that rides out the door the day after the night.

At the shop where I had borrowed the sandbags, the gate was up and the owner had a mop in his hands like a cudgel against despair. He had my note pinned to the corkboard along with a picture of a baby making a face at a lemon. He accepted the bags back with the modesty of a man who knows there is nothing more embarrassing than being thanked for survivals that did not depend on him. I tried to pay for the scoop and he tried to refuse and we engaged in the ancient ritual where men pretend they do not want money or pride, and in the end we did the decent thing: I bought twelve screws and a length of chain we both agreed would be useful in the kind of future that believes in gardens.

The Night of Edges did not happen the way a manifesto would recognize as a victory. The tram stayed up. The badge readers blinked like old dogs and got over it. The clinic saw two people without appointments because rules felt silly for twenty minutes and then rules remembered what they were for. The bakery turned the egg timer while the lights flickered and saved its bread, which is a sentence I would like on my grave. The school bell stopped at 11:12 and Ms. Lai stood in the hall and clapped her hands and said, “It is whatever time we say it is,” and nobody believed her and everyone followed her back inside anyway.

Deke and I went to check on the filter on Eight because we were superstitious about leaving anything that could be cleaned dirty on a day after a storm. Omero had written a note on a rag that said “You did this” and I pocketed it because some praise expires if it sees daylight. We stood in the corridor with the panels that sound like thinking and did not talk because talking is a sport best left for afternoons when your hands are clean. He put his head against a door and said he could feel a room deciding to forgive us for something we hadn’t done yet, and I told him to be careful about rooms that are that generous. He asked me if I thought he was still a member of something and I told him he was a member of the group of people who have held a ladle in a room that was making up its mind, which is the only membership that has survived, historically.

My father called and did the meanest thing: he asked me for help with something as small as hanging a shelf. It is very difficult to remain angry with a person who asks you to bear weight in a way that will embarrass you if you fail. We went to his apartment, which was clean in the way apartments are clean when no one cooks and the windows are careful about who sees. He had been brave enough to buy the wrong kind of anchors. We made a pilgrimage back to the hardware store and stood in the aisle like men facing their gods. He made a joke about screw sizes that would have humiliated me six months ago and I found myself correcting him gently and then apologized in my head to all the registers of my adolescence that still love contempt. We hung the shelf imperfectly. It held anyway. He brought out a jar of his own jam that he had made like a man trying to be a person I would not blame for using sugar as a hiding place. It was pear and full of chunks and tasted like someone had tried. He sent me home with two jars, one for my mother and one for Salome, and I did not count that as restitution because you cannot, but I ate some on toast later and allowed the parts of my body that are not interested in moral math to feel nourished.

At school, Ms. Lai added three words to the chalkboard litany that made the room go quiet as if we were waiting for a verdict. She wrote, “Please do not confuse urgency with importance,” and then, because she is incapable of leaving us without an action, she wrote under it, “Please do not confuse importance with loudness.” She asked us to name the quietest important thing we had seen during the storm, and I said, without wanting to be that boy and being that boy anyway, “A man handed his phone to a stranger and said call your mother, I have battery,” and she nodded and Deke raised his hand and said, “A sewer cover blinked and then decided to behave,” and she looked at him as if he had just learned a second language.

The Ember Sons split by then had names we were not supposed to use in public. There were the Forts and the Floors. The Forts had a basement and a printer that had learned to spite paper. The Floors had nineteen floors where nothing happens and a schedule of Tuesdays. Boys made their declarations in slogans they would regret later and men left without writing speeches. Wrought posted a video with his back to a wall and asked us to consider the cost of weather that is allowed to say no to us. He wanted thresholds to be the old kind that take blood and I thought, with some shame, that I had no interest in handing him mine again even in metaphor. When he talked about devotion now I could hear that he meant to himself, which is not immoral but is dangerously unambitious.

Leda invited me to train two new Tuesday kids, boys with shoulders that weren’t sure where to go yet and eyes that kept asking to be told what to want. She made me show them how to wrap a burn without giving a pep talk, which is harder than it sounds if you like to narrate ethics. One of them cried because someone thanked him with too much sincerity. The other one asked if he could wear the vest home and Leda said yes with the kind of caution you use when you hand someone a candle and you don’t know how good they are with gravity. We watched them leave and then Leda said, “There’s a moment when a boy chooses not to be a weapon. I live for that. It almost never happens on camera,” and she used her key to lock a cabinet with a twist that felt like a period at the end of a run-on sentence.

I wanted to give the storm a good ending and it refused me because it was busy becoming repair. We walked our hall with a bucket and a sponge and an idea of civility. The woman at the end of the hall allowed us to see her without her lipstick, which almost made me kneel. She had a drawing of a trombone on her wall and I asked if she played and she said she did when she remembered to be alone, which told me all I need to know about people forever. Salome’s thumb healed exactly as much as it needed to and then decided to scar in order to remember. The cello woman played a scale that makes the light in a kitchen behave itself. Omero took my hand and put it on the side of a boiler and said, “There,” and all I heard was a hum, but I nodded because sometimes you respect a language you will never speak.

At the end of the week, we held the Rigor Fair again because it had gone well and because everyone wanted to feel useful without pretending to be unique. I wrote a new sign that said, “Practice is not punishment,” and put it next to the mint on a table that had been bowed by more arms than we deserved. Ms. Lai brought a bag of lemons because she is an honest woman and wrote “Please do not confuse ease with mercy” in the air with her hand before she set them down. Deke made a joke about knives and peeled one in a long spiral and we watched it like children at a birthday party watching a trick they refuse to get bored with because getting bored would require pretending we don’t care about obvious miracles. We ate the lemon dipped in sugar and it was sour and sweet and my mouth made water and my head made figurative language and I decided to do the opposite for once and put the ladle away without a speech.

The city wrote nothing about us that mattered. The towers issued statements about resilience that made me wish statements would learn to eat soup. Wrought put out a pamphlet on heavier paper than his ideas and boys handed it to each other breathless and I did not judge them because I can read the genealogy of my hunger in their hands. My father sent me a picture of the shelf with something sitting on it, a plant that did not mind being a beginner. Ms. Lai circled a sentence in my essay that had gotten louder than it deserved and wrote, “Shh,” with a smile drawn so carefully it could have been a tiny ship. Salome added to her list on the door, number twenty-six: “Remembering where the draft got in,” and number twenty-seven: “The first good sleep after noise,” and number twenty-eight: “Mint that survives even when you do not,” and then she crossed out the “even” because survival should not be adversarial.

That night I went to Kestrel’s nineteenth floor and sat with my back to the glass and my eyes full of the city in its new clean smell. A man asleep on the couch snored respectfully. The birds ticked and tilted their heads like people keening for gossip. Leda’s vests hung in obedience. Iris had left a coil of rope on the table with a note that said, “For the next time you think a knot is a metaphor, tie it first.” I tied one badly and then untied it and tied it again because this is the entire point of being given hands. I put the knife back into my pocket and the ladle into my bag and the pencil behind my ear. I waited for the machine to cough and it did not, or else my body had decided it was done needing that sound to prove I was awake. I went home through a city that had been embarrassed by the storm into saying thank you to drains, and slept with the kind of sleep you get when you have carried weight that wants to be carried and set it down and not broken a plate even once.Chapter Ten

The first sound of the week was a pencil breaking in a way that made everyone in the classroom look up as if something bigger had snapped. Ms. Lai did not sigh because she refuses to make her breath punitive, but she did tilt her head and say, “Please do not confuse patience with passivity,” while she sharpened the pencil like a surgeon who had decided to do small medicine today. Outside the window, the fog that had pretended to be a personality last week had receded into being weather again, which felt like a demotion and a relief. The copy room door, beneficiary of my truce with oil, behaved itself all morning and then decided to complain again right when a teacher carrying a stack of papers wide as a moral panic tried to shoulder it open. I stood and put my palm on the hinge as if it were a forehead and it remembered me, which is to say it stopped whining without making me beg. Deke slid into his chair a beat late with the loose-shouldered apology of someone who has earned his lateness and still hates wearing it, and he handed me a folded flyer with an embarrassed face that made me want to praise him and scold him at once. The flyer was for the Night of Edges that had almost been a week ago, the ink still rich as if a printer somewhere had not accepted the storm’s verdict. He whispered that Wrought had added a postscript, something about “teeth needing drought,” and I bit my tongue because if I start making jokes in class I will never stop. The board had a new sentence under last week’s liturgy, in Ms. Lai’s neat square: “Please do not confuse repair with erasure.” She underlined it once and then put the chalk down deliberately as if refusing a second underline was the rigor today required.

Kestrel announced a Festival of Redundancy in a tone that would have made you laugh if the city hadn’t recently been embarrassed by very simple failure. The posters were tasteful, which is to say they looked like invitations to a wedding between two concepts that had already lived together for twenty years and were finally getting around to telling their parents. “Come see how the gentle engine fails in pairs,” it said, and then underneath, in smaller type, “and how we love it anyway.” The schedule read like a story where the protagonist is a spare. There would be demonstrations of hand pumps next to the pumps the hands had trained, a room with two clocks where the important one was the one a woman wound after lunch, a class on writing down the things you only remember because your body does them. Iris sent me a message that said, “Bring paper,” and Leda replied with, “Bring cups,” and Eleanor added, “Bring a serious face and then abandon it at the door.” Wrought posted his own counterfestival called The Clean Break in a font with too much spine, promising sessions on “refusing fallback” and “living without nets.” The comment section became an honest fight for once, not a performance, because even boys who like poetry have learned to love backups since the storm.

At Matra, Omero and I started a project that made him happier than any sabotage ever could, which is to say we sat down together at a metal table with a stack of cheap composition books and began a Manual. He called it The Shadow Guide because he loves drama when he can stuff it in his pocket and because “shadow” sounds like something you can walk with. It was a list at first, then a system pretending it wasn’t, then a set of sentences that decided to be a grammar. How to calm a valve that believes in thunder. How to talk to a stairwell with your hand before you trust your eye. How to choose the right rag for a mess you could have prevented and how to forgive yourself when you didn’t. How to open a stuck window in a way that leaves everyone’s pride intact. Iris added a chapter with diagrams that looked like music about tying a knot where the knot is the least interesting thing. Leda wrote a page with the heading When They Start Crying and then crossed out “they” and wrote “you” and drew a thermos next to the paragraph like a punctuation that could be poured. Eleanor sent a voice memo we transcribed, insisting on sections titled “How to nap,” “How to leave gracefully,” and “How to return without audience.” Salome contributed a recipe in the language of industrial maintenance, which is how to make soup when the building is a body: decant, simmer, brace, salt, rest under towel, monitor for shudder.

Deke loved the idea of a manual because it allowed him to be both poetic and obedient, a combination that makes boys stand up straight without noticing. He proposed a section with a ridiculous title, Only Devotion Has Force But Please Define Devotion, and we let him because it made him sit in a chair and not run toward something with his chin out. He wrote about what it means to show up on a Tuesday and pour until your wrist aches and you are no longer narrating your goodness, just doing the job, which is devotion I can accept. He wrote about sweeping a floor that will not praise you and determining to sweep it again tomorrow and how force, in that definition, is not what knocks a thing over but the thing in your hand that keeps moving in a circle until the dirt gives up. He did not show this section to Wrought, which felt like a better divorce than yelling.

The Festival of Redundancy began with an embarrassment of chairs. The nineteen floors opened their doors as if with a yawn and we walked into rooms designed with the kind of kindness that scares men who mistake cruelty for spine. There were posters that said “Two ways to stop a drip,” and then images of a wrench and a dish pan, and Leda stood in front of them with a pointer she had found in a drawer and used it as if she had been born to redirect attention. A girl from the eighth grade came with her grandmother and asked if she could learn to wind the clock and Iris let her and the look on the grandmother’s face when the girl’s fingers met the key would have undone a worse city than ours. The birds practiced falling and being caught and we timed them with a metronome so they could pretend they were musicians. There was a room with two switches that controlled the same light and the sign on the wall read, “Love means either will do,” and I knew it was manipulative and I still liked it. Omero made a joke about cross-linking that no one laughed at because we were all too busy being moved.

Wrought set up his Clean Break in the basement of a dental office because he enjoys a joke he doesn’t have to acknowledge. He put up a banner with teeth that had been sharpened beyond use. He talked about how redundancy is a sop for cowards who have decided to live forever. He asked if we wanted to be men who can track our own shadows or men who pay women to hold the flashlight. He handed out pamphlets with a single word on the cover—EDGE—and men held them the way people hold church programs before a funeral when no one cried yet. Deke went because he is tempted by altars, and he stood in the back and then came back upstairs and stood in line for a demonstration where a woman showed us how to restart a humidifier without yelling at it. He did not say anything mean about Wrought to me, which is how I knew the part of him that wanted drama had been fed enough to behave.

In the middle of the second day, Matra’s childcare announced a lockdown without menace when an elevator got shy again and decided not to open. It was not a crisis; it was a whimper with a schedule. A teacher with the eyelashes of a saint texted Iris who texted me because carrying a rope has consequences. We went with a basket and a coil and a bag full of snacks that had learned their jobs. Iris attached a line to the handrail with the calm of a person who has taught more than one child not to panic. I held the basket and she lowered it, and the children inside the elevator cheered as if we were pirates who had brought oranges. We sent down juice in boxes with straws attached and a book of pictures of faces making clear expressions because sometimes children need to be told what their faces are doing in that box. Deke performed the only magic trick that matters in a stuck place, which is he sat on the floor outside and talked through the door about boredom like it was a friend, counting with the children and then inventing a counting that had nothing to do with numbers. When the doors finally decided to be doors again, the kids came out like astronauts and the teacher thanked us with the ferocity of someone who understands that the right rope is a sacrament. Wrought posted a paragraph about how we had taught dependence and I threw my phone on the couch as if disrespecting a tool could starve a man of attention.

Ms. Lai turned the Manual into curriculum with a slight apology because she knows adolescents hate being turned into a class. She asked us to choose one entry and translate it into the language of a story, not as a metaphor, as a precise narrative. I picked the page titled To Unjam Without Humiliation, which is a skill useful in machines and in classrooms and at family dinners. I wrote about the time in the library when a printer refused to spit and how you resist banging it until it ducks and how you speak to it as if it were a person who wants to be seen doing its job, not yelled at for failing. I wrote about asking the person at the printer to step back and breathe and how stepping back is not banishment but permission to be wrong without witnesses. I wrote about my father’s shelf and the wobble and how we made it accept weight not by threatening it but by admitting what it was. Ms. Lai underlined the sentence where I said, “We are a city of jams disguised as deadlines,” and she wrote, “Careful,” because she knows when a boy’s sentences want to become slogans, and she had no patience for slogans unless they were honest and could lift a bucket.

At night my father brought over my knife like a cat bringing you a mouse it did not kill. He had sharpened it because sharpening is a kind of apology he can manage and he had not made it sharper in the way that would have pleased the boy I used to be. He had given it an edge that understood fruit and cardboard and the job of opening a box without making a performance of it. He did not ask to be thanked because he is learning at a rate that would embarrass him if he had a classroom to sit in again. He put the knife on the counter and asked if I had room in my manual for a section titled How to Admit You Are New, and I said yes and took out the pencil I keep tucked behind my ear like I invented writing. He told me the story of a screw that had said no until he left the room for twenty minutes and came back with less pride and the screw made a small sound and turned, which I will not forget because that is exactly how men behave, and sometimes boys.

We found ourselves in a argument we did not know we were having about who owns the words we had chosen for the Manual. The Floors, which is what we had become without admitting it, wrote pages in the cheap books and took photos of the pages and passed them to women in vests who passed them to men with carts who passed them to a kid who runs a site with a name that makes adults flinch. The Forts, which is what the sons in basements call themselves when they want to feel stone in their mouths, took the words and printed them on heavier paper with holes punched so they could be bound in red thread and called the collection The Book of Teeth. They changed nothing, which should have been flattering and was infuriating. Wrought posted a video flipping through our pages as if they were his. He paused on Leda’s When You Start Crying and said in a tone that wanted to be sympathetic and managed to be cruel that men have been denied tears so long that this instruction was a necessary part of their liberation, and I went to the sink and turned on the water and set my face in the steam because some sentences do not deserve a plaza.

Eleanor invited us to a room that was the opposite of a basement: high, glass, a wind garden with plants that teach you to ignore their shyness. She did not wear her scarf because it had worked too hard the last two months and she had put it to bed. She asked to see the Manual and she read without narrating her thoughts, which is the kind of love you do not expect from a person who lives on screens. She said, when she finally did speak, that the parts with instructions felt like poems and the parts with poems felt like instructions, and that we should print it cheaply and widely and be prepared to burn copies in front of an audience if that was asked of us because we could print more. She suggested a new section: How to Be Wrong in Public without Leaving the Building. She dictated the first line, “Say ‘my mistake’ with your mouth and then with your hands for a week,” and I wrote it down and wanted to love her the way the internet loves her and refused myself the indulgence because she is a person and I do not want to help turn her into a symbol that will then be used as an excuse to throw a rock.

The tool library called to tell us the clamp shaped like yearning had a previous life as a metaphor and we could keep it if we promised to stop treating it like one. Bess said that tools work best when you name them something boring, like Number Three, and I wrote a section for the Manual that read: “Call the thing you love by its job.” Salome edited it with a red pencil and added, “Also call the person you love by their name,” because she cannot resist making sure the practical bleeds into the sentimental. She brought over a lemon the size of a fist and told me to choose my symbol because she was tired of monitoring my metaphors, and we both laughed without ending the laughter in a lesson so that it could evolve into a shared joke instead of a curriculum.

The city announced a Day of Hands where everyone who had ever been paid to care—nurses, janitors, teachers, plumbers, the woman with the permit—would have a table on the plaza and show children how to do one small thing that looks like nothing and is the hinge on which the day actually turns. Ms. Lai dressed like a librarian disguised as a janitor and brought a box of pencils and a sign that read Verbs. Leda set out cups and a bowl of sugar and a bottle of vinegar with a label that said Look, Don’t Touch. Omero arrived with a length of ducting he had bent into a curve that made the light feel domestic and a little dangerous. Iris showed a knot and then made everyone undo it. I did the thing I do: stood, listened, lifted, kept a ledger on scrap paper of who had come by and what they had understood, which felt like a secret promise I could keep.

Wrought held a counter-assembly on the other side of the plaza at a table with sharp angles where boys could come and be told that their hands have been stolen and they could reclaim them by refusing to hold cups. He wore a shirt that made his posture into an accusation. A boy with a wolf for an avatar approached his table and then turned and approached ours and took a cup and did not look anyone in the eye and drank and then put the cup down like he had been trained to hide the evidence of his need. Wrought saw him and made a face and I almost felt for him because losing a boy to sugar can feel like losing a war if your god is hungry. Then a woman in boots who has had no time for nonsense since she was twelve came to his table and asked him to help her move a crate of water and he did, because the body knows before the mind, and I decided to love him exactly that much and not an inch more.

We printed the Manual and left it in stacks on tables where people were tired. We put copies in the elevator and in the room with the two clocks. We tucked one under the keyboard of the man at the desk with the nametag T because she sees everyone and deserves to be surprised. We brought a stack to the basements because we are not petty to the point of withholding medicine. The cover was ugly because we made it late at night and thought Helvetica would save us and it didn’t and that was appropriate. Ms. Lai wrote “proof” on the first page and then crossed it out and wrote “practice.” We wrote our names in the back in tiny letters after a page that said, “If you are holding this, put your name in it somewhere hidden so that when you are tired you can find yourself.” Deke put his initials where the binding catches and smiled the small, private smile of a boy who has stopped needing applause every hour.

On a Tuesday that forgot to be special, the alarm on Eight tested itself with a chirp and then remembered it had an audience and quit. The filters that we had left alight with our good intention went gray at the edges because air is an honest enemy. I was in the hallway with a wrench and an opinion when Omero told me to put the opinion away and just use the wrench. We pulled the cassette and the smell that came out was the smell of a city that refuses to wash its hands between feelings. Deke swore by habit and then laughed at himself and then moved his mouth in a way that meant he was about to say something sentimental and didn’t, which is growth in any species. Iris came by and said we had earned a snack, which is the only grade I believe in. We sat on the floor and ate something wrapped in paper that might have been food and might have been hope and we did not talk about Wrought because not talking is sometimes the only power you have over a man with a camera.

My mother printed the Manual on the cheap printer at home and put one in the kitchen drawer where she keeps the good scissors and the bar of chocolate she claims is medicinal. She folded the pages with the fat competency of a woman who has folded every kind of letter. She read aloud from the section titled When You Hear Yelling In A Room You Are Responsible For and then she fixed me with the look I grew up under and said this applies to boy rooms also, not just boilers, and I said yes with my hands by drying the dishes in the right order. She added a sticky note to the page that said, “Remember the ladle,” which is how domestic instruction becomes law in our house. My father came over, saw the Manual on the counter, and did not make a joke about men writing cookbooks, which counts as progress and a small miracle. He turned to the page about being wrong in public and read it like he was trying to swallow a stone and then he said, “My mistake,” and then he fixed a drawer that had been refusing to close since January and did not announce it and my mother said thank you with a laugh that let the kitchen know it could relax for an hour.

There was a boy in our class named Rowan who had been born with a talent for any sport that requires you to collide with something and call it courtship. He is the kind of kid older men recruit and poets risk false metaphors on. He has kept his distance from both of our rooms, the basement and the nineteenth floor, because he thinks he knows the cost of belonging and he has been saving. He came to me after school with a face that had been practicing asking a question until it bruised. He wanted to know if the Manual had a section called How To Stop Believing You Are Only Useful When You Are Bleeding. I flipped pages and pretended to look because sometimes pretending is polite and real and I said yes and read him the part about sitting down on the curb with your head between your knees and letting your heart slow and using a rag not to stanch blood but to wipe a table. He nodded like a man at an altar and then went to Leda and poured for an hour without comment and left his rag folded on the table as if it were a hand he intended to offer again.

In the basement, Wrought held up our pages and accused us of co-optation, which is a word that tastes like old coffee. He called us houseboys, which made me laugh because it sounded like a role in a play from a century ago. He said we had taken male hunger and dressed it in aprons, and a boy next to him who had not eaten since breakfast fainted because fainting is what bodies do when metaphors get drunk. Two women with vests were there because of course they were and they caught him and a human can hold only so much rage in the presence of a person fainting politely on a vinyl floor. Wrought paused long enough to let his heart realize there were other organs here and then he kept talking, but softer, which is the only victory I wanted that day. We passed a thermos in the back because a basement is safer when someone has hands around something warm even if they are pretending to be iron.

On Friday, Ms. Lai put the Manual on a projector, which made me want to hide under my desk and pretend I was a furnace filter. She had chosen three pages, and she read them in a voice that would make anyone behave. Then she asked what was missing, and our class, a room full of children who are tired of being asked to confess every thought for a grade, said the obvious thing: there was no chapter called How To Ask For Pay. Ms. Lai smiled the smile of a woman who has been waiting for her students to remember the world exists, and she wrote, “Please do not confuse gratitude with wages,” on the board and underlined it the exact number of times we needed. We wrote that chapter over two periods and it was the most difficult thing we had done all year because naming your worth in front of your friends can make your throat decide to be a hinge again. We listed verbs like tally, demand, justify, decline; we crossed out justify and replaced it with remind. We handed the draft to Leda who took it as if it were a crackling baby and said she would bring it to a room with a printer that bit and make it real.

I went to Salome and read her the whole Manual with the kind of pride that lands like dust, not in your eyes, in your lungs. She listened with her head tilted as if I had become the weather. She pointed to one section, the one that said If You Have Done Harm In The Name Of Force, and remarked that we had gotten very good at writing about guilt without being asked to prove anything, which is a skill and a disease. She told me to add a page titled Ask Someone Who Doesn’t Like You To Edit This, and I wrote it in big letters and we laughed because what a terrible idea and what a necessary one. She gave me the lemon again because apparently it is a character in this story and I took it because apparently I have decided props make me brave. The cello next door practiced the notes that bruise and then heal in the same bar and we sat very still to let it.

On a Sunday that put on a shirt and called itself Monday, the city held a small ceremony at the plaza, not pomp, not even ribbons, just a circle where the people whose names never get read into microphones got to read the Manual out loud, each one taking a section they had lived. Omero read the part about heat and the way you check with your palm first because your palm is honest. Leda read the crying page and did not cry because she wanted to save it for later when no one would applaud. Iris read the knot page and tied one while reading and then untied it while not reading, which made three men in the second row fall a little in love and repent of not having ropes. Eleanor stood in the back and clapped at the right time and then left without being filmed, which is my favorite thing about her when she remembers to do it. Ms. Lai leaned into my shoulder and whispered, “Please do not confuse publication with permission,” which I did not understand until later when the comments came in and the city disagreed with us politely and thoroughly and we then had to decide whether the Manual was a fixed thing or a plant.

I thought I would end the week with a dramatic discovery and the week ended me with dishes. The kitchen filled with the steam of something respectable and undramatic and my mother hummed a tune meant for spoons. My father knocked because he is practicing and held up a jar of pickled something like a peace offering from a country with no army. We sat, the three of us, and ate a meal that would not become a story unless I made it one, and I tried not to because sometimes you owe a thing the dignity of being small. My phone vibrated in my pocket with the hunger of a world that loves to demand updates and I let it starve also. The Manual sat on the counter getting splashed and stained and I decided not to be precious about it because if a book cannot survive onion and oil it does not deserve its spine. I went to bed with the smell of vinegar on my hands and the sensation of rope still in my fingers and the knowledge that the knife in my pocket could open a box and the ladle in my bag could feed a room and the pencil behind my ear could make something official without anyone’s permission. I waited, out of habit, for the machine to cough, and it didn’t, because sometimes the city remembers it is a body and it breathes the way bodies do when they have decided not to show off. I dreamed of a page with a stain on it and a line in the margin in Salome’s handwriting that said, “Enough is when you can sleep,” and in the morning I believed it for the length of time it takes to wind a clock.
