The freezer hummed like a patient bell, a monotone at the back of the flat, a soft machinery that did not care about weather or time or the little drum in his chest. Abhishek placed his palm on the door and felt the cold climb into him as if he had pressed his hand onto a winter stream. The kitchen smelled of cloves and bleach, of tea leaves that had dried on the counter, of copper coins that sometimes made him think of sunsets. He had hung a garland of paper hearts from the lamp. They spun when the draft crawled under the door.

He believed in love the way moths believe in lamp light. Without question and with ruin.

He was small. Not child-small, not now, but small as a misprint in a thick book, something your eye could skip if you were tired. In mirrors he looked accidentally arranged: a nose like a hyphen, eyes like commas, a mouth that caught on words and then sprinted. Goblin, his grandmother had once said, laughing, pinching his cheek, and he had collected the word and tucked it away. It had made sense of the other words that followed him through schools and rooms and days. Goblin. Stooped and quick. Soft and sharp. A bump under a rug. A footnote in the dark. He grew up into it the way ivy grows up into a wall.

Love is a type of hunger. You could water it, you could feed it, or you could let it chew at your ankles until you heard bone.

He liked hospitals. The fluorescent wash of corridors. The way nurses moved: practical ballet, coin-efficient, trivial miracles with a smile. He watched them without blinking—how could he blink? You would miss it, the small mercies, a hand on a forehead, a pillow fixed, a word that lifted a person back onto themselves. He wore quiet like a suit. He made himself thin between the vending machine and the stale clock and learned the rhythms of shift changes the way a dancer might learn a score.

There was a bus stop near the emergency entrance where the wind turned corners like a dog, an anxious creature sniffing for entrance. The nurses gathered there after midnight, wrapped in their coats, speaking in that hoarse relief that follows an impossible hour. Names drifted. Laughter rang out and was immediately checked, as if laughter were a flame that needed cupping. It was here that he had first said the word darling aloud in years, a word that tasted like a soft fruit.

Not to them. To the air. Practicing. Polishing it on his tongue.

Sofia at night could be all teeth and secrets. The lattice of streets wore dew and dust, opera posters pasted over plumber adverts, the river of traffic razoring through. The city never smelled the same two evenings in a row; tonight it had turned its face toward wet concrete and roasted peppers. Lights speckled the mountain's shoulder. Somewhere a stray dog’s collar clinked against its tongue.

In the chapel off Shipka Street, Mr Mabie placed a plank of incense onto a coal and closed her eyes as the fragrance laced the wooden air. The church was old but not proud. It held its age softly, like a sweater that had been mended, its stitches showing if you looked and becoming beautiful when you did. She had come to the city seven years ago from a place that had more sheep than people, drawn by a vacancy notice that had been misaddressed. They had expected a man; they had written “Mr” as if it were a brick in a wall, immutable. She kept the brick. She did not need to explain herself to anyone except the person in the mirror and God on Tuesdays when no one else came.

When people asked, she smiled. She could wear a collar and a pronoun and leave both on the back of a chair at night. The parish understood her because the parish had more to do than misunderstand miracles. She was the kind of vicar who bought practical shoes and refilled the hand soap in the bad bathrooms and said the words “I’m sorry” and “I don’t know” without flinching.

News reached even the quiet corners.

“It’s the thumbs,” said Zora, who scrubbed the candle wax off the floor tiles with a knife and a patience that could have disarmed a war. “Did you hear? The newspaper does not put it on page one, but the nurses talk. He takes only the thumbs. The police say very little. Of course they do.”

Mr Mabie looked at her hands, the way Zora used her own thumbs to press the blade flat. Necessary tools. The world was a hinge. Without thumbs you could still pray, of course, but certain doors would be harder to open, certain jars more reluctant. “How do you know it's a he?”

Zora’s eyebrows did a formal shrug. “Because if it were a she, they would have said unwell woman, and because the world likes its monsters predictable. Because of the writing.” Zora tapped a finger on her skull. “You know it too. You feel it.”

Feel it. As if fear had a draft. As if the city breathed and you could read its breath. The vicar watched the smoke rise, a gray ribbon curling. She thought of the women in the parish in their white shoes and green scrubs, their hands always a little dry, their eyes training themselves to reconcile the impossible with the necessary. She thought of their names and the way names were the first blessing and the last thing a person had a right to. All week long, small pieces of the story had reached her like bits of paper in a wind: an aunt told a cousin who told a neighbor that a nurse had returned from a night bus with one hand bundled in her scarf; an orderly had found a note in a lift that read, Thank you, and I will always carry you with me, and taped it onto his locker as a warning.

No blood in the rumours. No gore in the words. Just the fact of absence, neatly tied.

She lifted her head and did not say the words that warmed in her mouth: Not in my city. As if it were truly hers. As if the streets did not go their own way. Instead she said a line from Compline, and then she said the line again as if repetition could thicken a prayer like soup.

Abhishek learned early that people did not look down unless they had dropped something they loved. He moved low. He let people step over him. He let the city's under-furniture become his world: the undersides of tables in cafes, the edges of potholes, the lip of a fountain where coins wore a thin green dream. The world above moved fast and tall and loud. The world below had more truth in it. He wrote names in a notebook with a stub of pencil. He wrote details because details made people close. Ana laughs with her wrist. Milena hums when she washes her hands. Dessislava is tired at 3:17 but hides it with a joke. In the margins he drew hearts as if they were commas stuffed with extra feeling, as if a sentence could end with a name and begin again with a hand. He learned the bus routes that knit the hospital to the city’s edges. He kept a calendar and circles. He kept his voice for later.

On a Tuesday the rain was fine as thread. At the end of a midnight shift, a nurse named Irena buttoned her coat in a way that was also a prayer and stood beneath the shelter with her bag tucked under her elbow like a child. She had braided her hair tightly because the floor was always trying to catch you. Her friend Niko lit a cigarette and then didn’t smoke it, just held it like a pencil in his hand, forgetting what it was for.

“Tell me again what your mother did about the cow,” he said, and Irena laughed because it was a ridiculous story and it had become their ritual, a way to sand down the rough edges of a night that had cut them both thinner.

They were watched from a place that was not precisely shadow, because you can make a shadow out of attention alone. Abhishek stood just beyond the frame of a billboard that showed a woman drinking water as if it were a better life. He lifted his hand and put it down. He had learned patience from the city; he had learned speed from his own blood. He thought of the freezer humming in the apartment with its bright domestic confidence. He thought of the white labels he used, the neat script. He would not think beyond that. You have to be careful where you put your thinking.

When the bus came with its blue breath, the driver looked at them tiredly and then softened when he saw the scrubs. In Sofia the bus drivers know everything. They know who is running to catch up and who is running to leave. Irena took a seat by the window and wiped a small oval to see. On the glass she wrote an absent-minded cross with her knuckle. She did not notice the other passengers enough, which is another way to say she was precisely a normal person. She did not notice the small man who did not sit but stood with his hand on the pole, head down as if reading something only he could see.

When she got off, he got off. When she turned, he turned. It was rain that made the sidewalks slick and the streetlamps shiver. She was thinking of her bed. She had a cactus named Slava on her kitchen table that was currently flowering as if it had secrets. She was thinking of her mother’s cow. She was not thinking of horror because the news turned horror into a series of neutral nouns and did not properly represent the feeling of someone else’s breath in your walk.

There are street corners where stories collect. The one at the end of Irena’s road had a bakery and two bins and a window with curtains that never moved. If you were the sort of person who believed in signs and patterns, you would have seen the way the air pooled there, the way the night was waiting with one eye open. When she stepped into the small square of yellow light from the bakery’s front lamp—a bulb they never turned off—the goblin moved.

Later she remembered only the smell of yeast and an index of panic. She remembered a voice that said the word wait and then the word please. She remembered cold on her wrist, colder than you expect from any human thing. She remembered a song, a ridiculous song from childhood that began with a frog and ended with a wedding. She remembered someone else’s heartbeat and the feeling that this had already happened in a smaller story and therefore you could get through it.

After, there was a silence so well-made you could drink from it. Later she would stand in Mr Mabie’s church with her hand wrapped like a gift and she would say, “He said he loved me,” as if it were a confession, as if the word itself could be an accomplice. She would not cry. She would be furious in a way that warmed the pew.

The city’s rumor mill spun like a toy. Police sealed things and spoke into microphones with words that had been ironed. The newspapers used phrases like chilling and spree and spate. A television panel discussed the human hand for half an hour, which was boring until it became obscene. In the wards and pharmacies these stories grew a personal accent. For the first time, Mr Mabie said her own first name aloud in an empty room and it sounded like it belonged to someone else. She called the hospital chaplain and offered to sit with anybody who wanted to talk, and the chaplain laughed and said, “Anybody? That’s a lot of souls, Mr.” People came anyway, one by one, with tea and without tea, faces collapsed and faces held together with thread, and they told her their favorite jokes and their least favorite nights and she kept them company until they could fall asleep for an hour in the side chapel.

“Why do you think he keeps them?” asked a nurse called Sisi who had brought her daughter to sit in the back pew and draw horses in the margins of a hymnal.

“I don’t know,” said Mr Mabie. “Some people keep anger. Some people keep stamps. Some people keep quiet. Sometimes the keeping is the problem, not the thing.”

“Maybe he is a collector,” said Sisi’s daughter wisely without looking up from the horse’s mane, which she had rendered as a waterfall. “People who collect think they are saving things. They think they are rescuing them from dust. But then the dust is in their heads.”

Abhishek read the newspaper on a tram and felt misunderstood in a way that made him grin. It was not about pain. He did not like pain; pain was loud and messy and made people stupid. He was tidy. He was careful. He had taught himself to sing without opening his mouth because he had learned the hard way the kind of songs that tumble out when you are not paying attention. He had lost something once, a long time ago, a small thing with its own heartbeat, and he had been told to get on with it, to get on with it, to get on with it. People were always telling you to get on with something. He had decided to get on with love. If the world was not equipped to hold exactly the right amount of love, he would store it himself, measure it, label it, keep it safe. The freezer hummed. The labels lined up like white teeth. He ran each one through his fingers as if reading Braille.

“Do you know the story about the goblins that live in the tunnels?” asked a man at the back of the sermon one Sunday, interrupting as if the parish were a kitchen and the vicar were stirring a pot he wanted to taste. He was new. He had a coat that looked bought to impress a job interview. He smiled too much with his mouth and not enough with his eyes.

“I know stories about a lot of things,” said Mr Mabie, resting a hand on the pulpit’s edge. “Tell me yours after we put the hymn away.”

He waited and then stepped up while people were leaving. He told her about the baths under the city, the aqueduct bones, the cracks where old heat still moved. He told her about men with flashlights and maps who had found shoes in places shoes should not be, and a child’s ball that could not have rolled there on its own. He did not tell her his name and he did not ask for hers and there was something performative in his curiosity that made her neck feel like it needed to be washed. He used the word we when he meant someone else. She nodded and thanked him and then watched as he drifted toward the side door and out, as if the city had exhaled him.

In her office, which was not an office so much as a room with a desk and a kettle and two chairs that did not match, she sat with her hands pressed together and let her breath find its own chair. She knew she had to stop him. The knowledge did not come with a trumpet. It came like a small quiet fact, like the way you know there’s bread in the cupboard because you were the one who put it there. She had no badge or nightstick, no special permission to walk in the underworld in good shoes. All she had was her voice and a city that had accepted it as one you could answer to. She had done hospital visits and funerals and side-of-the-road prayers. She had held a woman’s hand in an ambulance as the driver broke every rule and she had listened to a man confess the kind of small fraud that had eaten him alive. She could be patient. She could be stubborn. She could be a door, if that was necessary. Sometimes stopping a thing meant standing in the way until it stopped against you.

It was dark when she left the church that night. The rain had become a mist that did not drop so much as arrive. The city had wrapped itself in the kind of quiet that damp cloth has. Her keys jangled in her coat pocket and the sound made her think of childhood and the way all adults smelled like keys back then. She turned down the alley between the print shop and the dentist’s office. The alley had its own weather. She stepped over a puddle. The puddle reflected half the moon and a smear of her face.

The parcel was on the step like a polite cat. It was wrapped in butcher paper and tied with red string, the color you use if you want things to look celebratory. She knew before she picked it up that the weight was wrong for bread. She knew before she pulled the string that she should not. She did not pull it. She leaned closer and read the handwriting, which was neat and old-fashioned and patient. Thank you, it said. Then below, in a smaller careful line: For keeping them warm.

She lifted the parcel and carried it to the sacristy because the sacristy was an honest room. She placed it on the table and stood there as if it might change its mind and become less itself. The string slipped apart like a tame snake. The paper opened like a mouth. Inside, wrapped in muslin that had once been a dishcloth and still bore a faint pattern of oranges, sat a small transparent box. Everything in it was clean. Everything had been arranged with the kind of respect that made nausea a complicated response. On top of the box was a card. The card said Love is a practice. I am practicing. Beneath that, in the same careful script, a drawing of a freezer, and a row of squares like teeth, and in each square a name written so tiny that only an intent eye could have told you what it said.

She did not open the box. She did not need to. She knew what had been sent even before she looked at the corners of the muslin where the knots had been tied expertly, knots a nurse might make when binding a soft wound. The cold had seeped through the fabric just enough to make her skin report its presence. She felt, briefly, like the city had closed a hand around her throat and then decided to release her for later.

She picked up the card and read the names, and in the middle of the list she found Irena. She thought of Irena’s cactus flower and angry jaw and thought, to her own surprise, of a frog singing at a wedding.

It became something else after that. The police came, of course, and asked questions in the polite language of people who have understood that the person in front of them will not be useful until the coffee arrives. They took the parcel and they photographed the step and the alley and the dent in the third stair that had been there since before the priest who came before her. They did not ask if she was afraid. She would have said no and it would have been both an exaggeration and a prayer.

In his flat, Abhishek added a heart to his notebook and then another because one looked forlorn alone. He ate an orange, sectioning it with the care of a surgeon who remembered when he still was called mister and not doctor, not because he wanted that title but because titles give other people a place to stand. He wrote in the margin, Mr, because it appealed to him. Mr as a sound, as a rumble, as a hum. He wrote, He knows she has to stop him, and then he crossed out the he and wrote she and liked the way the sentence softened and sharpened in that instant. It made him giddy to be known. It made him panicked to be seen. He thought of the vicar’s church, of the way the stone held heat in the day and released it at night. He thought of candles. He thought of the sacrilege of a freezer in a sanctuary and smiled at himself for thinking it. He thought of a song. He sang it without sound.

Back at the hospital, Sisi showed a photograph to the other nurses. It had been taken at a picnic, all of them in casual clothes and hair loose, a cake with strawberries in the middle, the river photobombing them with a shine. Their thumbs hooked in pockets, on plates, in the air as if everything had been an approval. There were names. There were jokes written on the back in a black marker now thick with handling. They passed it around and said the word remember as if the word could be a blanket. They spoke of leaving Sofia and of staying in it and of changing shifts and of changing luck. The glow from the vending machines played trickery on their faces, making sorrow look like mere hunger. Their voices grew briefly panicked and then settled back into the slow tread of endurance. They would keep coming to work. They would check each other’s backs when they crossed streets. They would whisper, Love, to the patients who needed it and to the large empty corridor where nobody walked after midnight.

Mr Mabie went to the tunnels with a torch and a cheap map that had been folded and unfolded so many times it had learned the positions before hands told it what to do. She did not go alone because she was not interested in being a story herself. She took Zora who carried a bag with water and chocolate and two spare batteries and a length of red ribbon. They stepped into the city’s mouth and felt the old warm of it, a heat that had outlived purpose. The air was moist with other people’s breath from other centuries. They walked until the whole concept of directions seemed like a joke you could get tired of hearing. Zora tied the red ribbon to a pipe and back to another pipe, making themselves a lifeline, an umbilical cord to the street. They found a shoe where a shoe should not be. They found a tin horse that had the paint all rubbed off its sides from someone’s thumb. They found initials carved into a wall at a height too low for an adult. They found a silence that felt like an audience.

“Do you hear it?” Zora whispered.

“What?”

“The humming.”

It was there. But it was not loud, not a drumbeat or a train. It was the hum of a freezer in the back of a flat in a building above them where the lives were stacked like books and on the spine of one of them, written in a hand that was both elegant and shy, a name the whole city would learn to pronounce and then refuse to speak at all. The hum was everywhere if you were listening for it. The whole city hummed with all the small machines that kept love alive. Or tried to.

On the way back up, they passed two boys who had no business in that place if by business you meant anything legal or safe. The boys looked at them like cats do when you interrupt a ceremony nobody invited you to. The world carries a thousand parallel rituals at once. The boys went left when they should have gone right. Zora almost told them. She did not. There is only so much mother in a person that you can spend on strangers when you have daughters at home who will ask where you have been.

That night the city did not sleep. Or it slept with one eye open. A dog barked at an envelope. A couple argued about money and then about the way they argued about money. A train moved slow and the power lines sang. In a flat where the walls had been painted a yellow that made the winter less bold, a small man put a new label on a new square and made more room in his heart for something that had no space.

In the morning, Mr Mabie stood beneath the street tree outside the bakery and watched how the day built itself. Flour hung in the air like promise. She thought of the parcel. She thought of the freezer’s hum in a place she had not stood. She thought of breaking things and of making things and of the way the city wanted to keep the same face in photographs and in real life and could not. She looked up and saw a woman in a window pull back a curtain and look down at her and then close the curtain quickly. She saw a bus pass with the same tired driver who softened at scrubs. She saw her breath in the air, proving she was there, and the breath dissolved as if it had not been there at all.

Love is a practice. He had written it, and he had been right. Practice makes permanent, her old choir master had said, a correction to the hopeful sentence everyone thought was true. She imagined a goblin on a tram, making neat lists. She imagined his hands, not the damage they had done but the care they took with pens and paper and ribbon and string. She imagined the refrigerator aisle in the supermarket where she now could not stand. She counted days. She made a plan without giving it the dignity of that word. She wrote a sermon that would be about Moses and water and would be about none of those things. She took a deep breath and waited for the city to exhale.The morning began with a bruise-colored sky and a thaw that had crept into the city as if something behind the mountains had decided to exhale. The bells on Shipka Street were not loud so much as reasonable; they told you the time and then let you keep it. In the church, the congregation huddled into itself like birds on a wire, the winter coats steaming faintly as the radiators woke. Someone had put oranges on the altar rail where flowers normally went, a small rebellion with a peelable scent. Mr Mabie had washed her hands twice and still felt the idea of the parcel clinging, the cold of it bright in her palms even though the box was now an item number in the police office, wrapped with tape that said evidence in three languages. She did not need to think of the contents to think of the weight. She had written a sermon about Moses and water that was also about the habit of moving people out of danger and into a space where they could be named without fear. The words had arranged themselves the way a careful bread does, proving in their own time, rising in her head at night and sinking into the paper by morning.

She preached about rivers that saved and the people who made those rivers possible, about the work of lifting and the work of carrying, about the kind of love that looks like letting go. She told a story about a time she had walked home in the rain without an umbrella and had been given a plastic bag by an old woman who had been saving it for mushrooms; the bag had saved both of them from a kind of sorrow that swells when you feel foolish and wet at once. She spoke about practice, the way repetition can carve a groove in a life, and how you can choose your grooves, though it is harder than anyone admits. She did not say the word thumbs. She did not say his name, which she did not yet have, and yet she felt him as an audience inside an audience, a small listening that was listening to her specifically, an ear cupped to the door of her voice.

He was there. He had arrived early and taken a seat at the back where the light was forgiving and the draft did a loop along the floor. He had thought, for a foolish moment, of putting one of the paper hearts from his lamp into his pocket as a talisman, and then he had laughed at himself and left it for the lamp. He had washed his hands before leaving and stared, briefly, at his own thumbs as if they were foreign passports. He was fond of them as a pair, their competence, the way they made tasks certain. He told them to be quiet, as if they might chatter. In the pew he arranged his body in small precise ways that made him feel like one of those nested dolls, the smallest version of himself tucked inside the one he was using for the day. The sermon rolled over him like a tide and pulled back, and in the little pauses he heard the unspoken lines with more clarity than the spoken ones, which is how he always had listened to people. When she said that sometimes the bravest thing a person can do is unlearn something their own blood insists upon, he smiled. He was vain enough to think it was meant for him. He sat on his hands to keep them warm and to keep them honest.

Coffee after church had the usual choreography, the dangerous triangle of tables and elbows and sugar, the old men wedged into chairs like coins you couldn’t quite pry from the sofa. Zora had made banitsa and slashed the top with an expert impatience, and there was a lot of Thank you, Zora and a lot of Don’t cut the paper with that knife, it’s still got wax. A child tried to fish a slice of orange out of its skin with a plastic knife and made a mess that tasted like victory. People spoke of weather and a cousin who had gotten engaged and the way the buses were now never on time because the drivers were too kind to nurses and therefore the city was adjusting around small mercy. Abhishek moved through this world with the skill of smoke, touching nothing, being noticed only as a draft that scented vaguely of cloves and something else nobody could place. He watched the vicar speak to a woman with a headscarf who always sat on the right. He watched her listen like it was work and joy both. He took his time and he was slow on purpose.

He approached when the line for the kettle had thinned into charity. He smiled with his mouth and with his eyes, because he had read somewhere that only the eyes mattered and that the rest was stage set. He thanked her for the sermon and used a phrase like most nourishing which he had practiced on the tram to see if it sounded like a person and not like a card. She thanked him as if he had brought a practical tin of something to keep in the pantry. He asked after her hands. He made the question a joke, glancing at them like he could not help himself, as if a vicar’s hands might grow calluses from lifting the city’s mistakes. She showed him her knuckles and smiled a small warning around the edges, the way you smile when a dog is friendly and you have not yet met its teeth.

“Yes,” she said, and then instead of giving him the obvious next line she gave him a story. “When I lived by the sea, we would take beans and a blanket and sit where the sun bleached the rocks. If you left your hands flat on the stone long enough, the salt would write a poem on your palms. When you washed them later, you would lose it if you used soap. You had to let the sea do the washing. It took patience not to rush the poem away.”

He tilted his head like a listener who likes a detour because it lets him adjust his own footsteps. He told her he liked poems, which was true, and that he didn’t like salt, which was also true, and he laughed as if he knew he was being difficult. He introduced himself as someone else entirely because names are costumes and he had a wardrobe. He chose a name that would not be remembered unless she had a reason to write it down. She did not ask to write it down and he respected her for that choice.

The police had already called the church twice that morning, the first time to ask how the sermon had been, as if she had delivered it solely for their benefit, and the second time because somewhere else in the city someone had reported a parcel that turned out to be a new blender that a man had bought his wife too early for her birthday. Mr Mabie had learned the detective’s tone, the way it lay on the table and waited to see what she would put next to it. The detective was a woman named Boyanova who wore her hair in a practicality that had learned to be pretty behind its own back. She drank black coffee and had the sort of steady eye people give to children covered in jam and terrified of the evidence. She had told the vicar to call if the man came to see her, and she had not been specific about which man, because you do not say goblin in the daylight if you can help it. The vicar had decided not to be the city’s informant in the way the police meant. She would not trap him in a nave or a sacristy. But she would make a path and she would light it.

That afternoon she walked to the bus depot where the drivers took their breaks and played cards with cigarettes they did not smoke because they were repeatedly and solemnly promising their wives to quit. The air smelled of oil and peppermint because one driver liked to chew it to drown the taste of gasoline in his mouth, which his mother always said would poison him. She spoke to the drivers and asked them to keep a list of who softened at scrubs and by how much and which stops felt like the city was holding its breath. They made jokes because that is how men tell you yes and not to worry. One of them pressed a small sachet of dried mint into her hand because she looked pale. She slipped it into her coat pocket and later, when the coat hung in her office, the whole room smelled like a garden pretending to be a cupboard.

Zora took the red ribbon and cut it into smaller lengths and distributed them like sacraments. She gave one to Sisi and told her to tie it on her bag, and one to Irena, who had returned to work after a week that had been a year, and one to the woman at the bakery who had the habit of switching on her front light and then forgetting to switch it off until her husband shouted from bed. The ribbons swung and glowed like tiny arterial warnings. People saw them and asked and were told, and in that telling the city stitched itself tighter. In the market on Graf Ignatiev, a man selling cheap socks tied one to his stall and said it was to stop thieves from stealing his socks, and then when a boy did try to steal a pair he whacked the boy’s hand so lightly that the boy laughed and stayed to help fold the socks for an hour.

Abhishek felt the ribbon when he stepped into the street with it threaded through his notebook’s spine, a quiet betrayal of his own privacy. He had taken it like a pilgrim takes a pebble, partly because it made him feel witnessed and partly because he liked to be mistaken for a person with superstitions. He went home along the long way that made his legs ache in a way that could be mistaken for virtue. He thought about the sermon and the river and the way some women carried the whole city on their backs and called it walking. He wrote in his notebook with the stub of his pencil that was now more hand than wood. He wrote Mr, underlined, and then next to it he wrote a word from one of the dialects he had collected that meant aunt and was also sometimes used for the neighbor who watched your child when you could not. He wrote the word for love in three languages and crossed them out because the word was not the thing and sometimes it was a decoy. He ate a boiled egg with the concentration of a saint eating an orange. He turned the freezer down one notch as if he were turning a volume knob.

At the hospital, the rumor about the vicar’s parcel had matured into a legend that had the accuracy of a mirror seen through steam. The night-shift tea tasted like metal because the kettle had been scalded too often without sugar. Niko developed a habit of walking the female nurses to their bus stop which everyone pretended not to notice because acknowledging a man doing a good thing is sometimes like scaring away a deer by pointing. He told Irena another cow story because repetition is a bridge. She listened and then she told him one back about a neighbor who kept pigeons and taught them to return home by telling them he loved them, and how she had believed it as a child because children assume love is a map. She was wearing the ribbon Zora had given her on her wrist where the skin was still two tones of healed and healing. When the wind came it climbed the ribbon like a tiny climber and stayed a moment as if it had remembered someone.

A boy came to the church with eyes that had not yet learned to hide. He was not one of the regulars for whom prayer was a tonic, but he had the look of someone who wanted something he did not know how to name. He asked for a candle and then asked for a place to sit, and then asked for a place to stand because sitting seemed too much like making himself a target. He told Mr Mabie about the tunnels because he had heard from someone that she had gone down there, and he told her about a ladder he had found that led to a ledge that led to a hatch that led to a basement that led to a door that had not been opened in years. He said he did not open it because sometimes you do not, you just want to know that you could. He used the phrase we and then corrected himself to I and then back to we because he was trying to decide what kind of person he had become without telling anyone else yet.

In the evening, the vicar wrote a letter as if the city were a person and she were trying to be clear. She wrote to the goblin without calling him that. She wrote on church paper that had a crest it did not deserve. She wrote that love was a matter of custody, that we are custodians of each other and of our own worst angels, and that practice is not neutral. She wrote that she would sit at the bakery corner between midnight and two every night for a week and that nothing was expected of anyone who came except time. She did not ask him to return anything to her because she suspected that the ritual of keeping was too bound to his own marrow to be unlearned by request. She asked for something else instead. She asked him to write her a one-true-thing about the women he loved, not plural for number but plural for example, the way love can be a hallway with many pictures on the walls and all of them point back at you. She copied the letter by hand so that the ink could carry the weight of breath, and she left one copy on the back pew where the old men kept their newspapers, and one on the noticeboard where people posted rooms for rent and lost cats and cheap guitars, and one under the sugar tin in the kitchen because she knew some messages are meant to be found by accident.

He found the kitchen copy because it pleased him to go where he should not. He had made a study of the ways a person can belong without belonging, the way a person can open a door by looking like someone who should be opening doors. He had a jacket that made him instantly helpful and another that made people look away, and he chose with the same carefulness he used for labels. He read the letter and then read it again and then folded it into a shape that had been meant to be a bird but ended up being a boat because he had never learned to fold wings. He put it in his pocket and carried it home and unfolded it and placed it in the freezer because he could not help himself. Even paper, he thought, changes when it is cold. He considered her question and he closed his eyes and made a list that had more to do with the names in his notebook than with the contents of any box. He wrote things like Dessislava can write upside down and like to the left, and like Milena keeps a key in her sock and it has shaped her calf, and like Irena counts stairs when she is frightened and laughs on every seventh stair as if she had fooled arithmetic. He wrote without guilt and then he felt the guilt arrive late, a commuter in a thick coat. He sat with it and made tea and did not sugar it. He found the part in himself that wanted to be absolved and placed it in the freezer too. The hum held it.

Inspector Boyanova followed the ribbons with the focus of a tailor sewing a suit on a moving man. She watched the bus stops and the alleyways and she counted faces without a notebook because some counting is body memory. She was not accustomed to vicars inserting themselves into her maps, but she found she did not mind this one, perhaps because the vicar did not demand a front-row seat to her own heroics. When she came to the bakery, the vicar was there as promised, wrapped in a coat that was a respectable argument against illness, a thermos like a promise and a paper cup in case someone else needed warmth. The inspector did not show herself. She sat across the street where the window had curtains that never moved and knew, without seeing, that someone was behind them. The city is a spice rack, some jars labeled and some not. That night, nobody came. The next night, an old man came and sat and told the vicar about his wife who had died three winters ago and how he still turned to tell her the good jokes, which related to bread, and to doctors, and to buses, and how he had learned that grief is a club where the subscriptions are always current. They drank tea and the old man cried politely and then apologized, and the vicar said people who apologize for tears always have the best handkerchiefs, and it made him laugh harder and that was a mercy. The third night, a woman came who had nothing to do with the hospital and everything to do with a post office where someone had stolen her wallet and how she felt that a theft in your pocket makes your whole face feel dishonest. The fourth night, no one again. The fifth night, he came.

He was smaller than she had imagined from his ordinary voice. He had a way of appearing as an edit, as if the paragraph had shifted around him and he were now the intended sentence. He did not sit; he stood with a stillness that looked like gravity had decided to stage a demonstration. He held something that looked like nothing, a shape in his coat that was probably a notebook because certain bulges cannot tell lies forever. He said, “You asked me to write you a thing,” and his voice did that strange trick of being both careful and quick.

“I did,” she said, and she passed him the cup with the last of the tea because sometimes the body is a door to the inside of a person and sometimes it is just a radiator. “Did you?”

He nodded and then did a thing she did not expect. He took the cup and lifted it like a toast toward the bakery window with its everlasting bulb and he said, “To wrists that do not bruise,” and drank. He swallowed like a person swallowing an argument. He did not hand back the cup; he held it because perhaps he needed to hold something, and the cup had once held warmth and therefore had a memory of it.

He told her a small truth. He told her about a woman named Ana who had a way of opening the pill cabinet with her elbow because her hands were always doing something else. He told her how beautiful it was, a choreography with screws and labels he had rehearsed at home with jars of spices until he could have done it himself with his eyes closed, though he would have been clumsy. He told her he had not watched from behind a hedge because hedges were for people who thought themselves romantic; he had watched from the edges of rooms where no one’s eyes had ever purchased a ticket to look. He described Ana’s laugh in a way that made the vicar picture the inside of her throat and the place where laughter touches prayer on its way past.

“Why?” she asked, because in the end the word always knocks. “Why carry what should go with its owner?”

He did not take offense because he had prepared himself for this question and a large part of him enjoyed being asked. “Because,” he said, “they forget. They forget to keep themselves. Everyone tells them they are strong and then they must be strong as a job. I am keeping a part safe until the world is better. I label things. I am tidy. They are in my care. I am careful with them.”

“They are not yours,” she said, and she did not raise her voice because this was not the place for volume. “You cannot keep a person by keeping a piece. That is not love. It is jealousy with scissors.”

He stiffened like paper that had been left near a stove. He did not answer for a moment because something in him had to translate and then think if it would accept the message. He looked past her as if the city had prompted him with a line and forgotten to shout it. “I have lost something,” he said finally, and the words came out the way a loose tooth comes out, with no blood and a sense of vacancy. “And they told me to get on with it. I am getting on with it. I have made order of it. If I return them, nothing will have been learned. They will go back to opening cabinets with their elbows and laughing and dying when someone else’s hands are not clean enough on their behalf. My freezer is a song of care. It is the sound of not losing.”

She thought of the humming in the tunnels and of Zora’s knife flattening wax and of Sisi’s daughter who could draw a horse’s mane like a river. She thought of practice making permanent and of the way rituals can be prisons that people decorate. “Then let me keep you,” she said, because bluntness is the last tool in the drawer when the others have failed. “If keeping is love, let me keep you until you have learned a kinder lesson. Bring me the names and the labels. Bring me what you have made, and I will put them on the altar and shame God with them if I must, and we will sit in the cold and say their names until something gives up or gives in.”

He looked startled and then delighted and then disappointed, a whole childhood in three seconds. He shook his head not because he was saying no but because his head knew it should. The city was breathing elsewhere; somewhere a tram’s brakes sang metal to air and made a prayer of friction. He gave her the cup with an absent apology and put his hands into his coat pockets as if he were returning instruments to a tray. “I will write you,” he said, and she knew he meant it because the word had landed heavy. He stepped backward and then to the side because he did not like turning his back on people who might put a hand on him and change his direction. He was gone in a way that made her think of a trick with scarves at a birthday party where the surprise was not that the scarves disappeared but that they had been scarves at all.

Inspector Boyanova had heard every word through a sliver the curtains had left her and she did not like the feeling in her chest, which was not fear and not anger but a cousin of both that made you go very still. She did not call for the car or the men because he was not running and she did not want him to practice running on her watch. She thought instead about words that land heavy and where people bring their heavy words to put them down. She wrote the vicar a message that said, In two days there is a saint’s day and the church will be full. Do not be a hero. The vicar read it and imagined peonies in winter and laughed aloud because laughter is a way to make yourself lighter and this night needed every trick a body knew.

Two nights later, Sisi’s daughter put a ribbon on the chapel’s statue because it seemed wrong to leave the saint out. The girl asked if God had thumbs and whether he missed them when they were nailed and the vicar said the kind of thing that sounds like an answer when you are eight and like a riddle when you are forty. Irena lifted a tray of tea cups with her elbow because her wrists were still learning, and she did it with the ease of a dancer who had been told she could not dance anymore and had proved them wrong in a room with no mirrors. In his flat, Abhishek printed a photograph on cheap paper, a photograph of his freezer with its neat teeth of labeled squares, and he taped it onto the wall above the lamp with the paper hearts so that when they spun they brushed the edges of the picture as if to disturb it into memory. He wrote the names again, smaller this time, in a hand that had become its own prayer.

The saint’s day was a Saturday and the church smelled like sugar because someone had given the vicar a bag of Turkish delight without trusting her with lemon. The pews were full of faces lifted like plates. A woman from the radio stood at the back with a microphone as a coat in case breaking news put a chill on her shoulders. Children ran complicated races around the font. Outside, cabs moved like beetles with their antennae lit. Inside, the hymns were louder than the usual Sunday because a crowd has its own acoustics and because Zora had put out a basket of percussion instruments that children were permitted to shake if they shook them in time, which they did not, and it did not matter. The vicar wore her collar and a necklace in the shape of a ship’s anchor because the day suggested it and because sometimes you need to remind yourself that the sea exists even when you can only smell snow. She had put the letter’s question into her sermon again in a way only one person would hear. She had made a space on the altar rail that would look like coincidence and would be a precise invitation. She had told the inspector she would not be heroic, which was true in the way that saying you will not fly is true as long as the ground cooperates.

He was not in his usual place because the usual would be too obvious. He had put on a different jacket that made him look like a schoolteacher, the kind who still believes children are made of expensive porcelain, fragile and worth the care. He had brushed his hair with water and it had dried in a phrase. He had a parcel under his arm that looked like it contained nothing sharp. He waited for a moment when the saint lifted their painted eyes toward the ceiling as if to say, This is your circus, and then he walked forward as if he were about to ask a question in a lecture on ethics. He placed the parcel where anyone might put a gift of oranges. He did not tie it in red, because that would have been rude. He used brown string and small knots that could be coaxed open by fingers that had changed dressings in the dark. He looked at the vicar and in his face was the pale triumph of a man who has found a way to comply with a request while obeying his own rules.

Inside the parcel, when opened later after the hymns and the sugar and the radio woman’s questions about community, there were labels. There were dozens of them, cut with clean scissor edges, white as teeth. They were already written, each with a name in the careful old-fashioned script that had the patience of needlework. They had dates. They had small hearts drawn where the dots over i’s would go if the names had i’s. There were no thumbs. There was a card on top that read Love is a practice. I am practicing letting go. It was not a confession, and it was not enough, and yet it shifted the air in the room as if someone had opened a high window. The police came and were angry in the way leniency makes people angry when they have sharpened themselves for something harder. The vicar took the labels like a sacrament and set them on the altar rail where they would be seen and perhaps touched by a person who understood what that meant.

That night, Sofia lost power in certain quarters and the darkness was honest and unsentimental. The freezer hummed on because the building had been rewired by a man who believed in his own light. Abhishek lay on his back and looked at the ceiling where the paper hearts made a mobile of shadows. He felt, for the first time in a long time, like a person with a choice that was not only a choice between versions of the same mistake. He imagined walking into the church with the box itself and placing it on the stone, and the vision made him breathless, not because of the fear of consequences but because of the intimacy of the act. He imagined the vicar’s hands on the lid and the city inhaling, upward and inward, to see if it was that easy. He fell asleep with his hands on his chest, his thumbs pressed together as if they were praying privately to be left out of it.

In the tunnels, the ribbon Zora had tied fluttered in an air that had not moved in years. A boy found it and followed it and found only his own breath, which caves make important. On the sixth night at the bakery, no one brought anything in paper or string. The vicar and the inspector shared a sandwich that had too much pickled cucumber and tasted exactly like compromise. A woman with a suitcase paused and asked for the way to the bus for a village that no longer ran a bus and would not for another month because the driver had broken his leg getting off the roof. They told her a different route and she thanked them with the kind of gratitude that includes a curse for the city because cities require both to keep them honest. Snow began to fall without ceremony, flour from a baker with no apron, and it made the street lamps look like they cared.

Somewhere in the dark, a song about a frog made its way back to a man who had not sung in years and did not think he would remember the words. He found that he had kept them without meaning to, the way he kept everything, and when he laughed at the wrong line he laughed like someone who had discovered a hand in his own pocket and found it attached to an arm he could forgive.Chapter 4

The city woke the way a bruise does, shading from purple into something that could be ignored if you had errands. Snow lingered around kerbs and on the backs of benches like old men refusing to move. The blackout had taught apartment windows to treasure their own light, and so on this morning every curtain seemed to breathe a little more deliberately, as if the apartments had learned to inhale for themselves. Bakery air threaded the street with its yeast-laced promise, and in the chaffer of pigeons there were more apologies than usual, because pigeons know when they have been cursed and forgive anyway. On Shipka Street, the bells took their time, ringing as if they were counting not the hour but the courage it would take to carry it.

Inspector Boyanova stood at her window and pinned a length of ribbon to a photocopied map with a bulldog clip that used to hold divorce papers. The ribbons had crept beyond her case board and onto the edges of her desk like ivy, red against the white of the city like blood that had promised not to spill. She was a woman who trusted routes and hands, and since she could not yet hold his hands she held his routes, tracing with a forefinger the soft Venn of night buses and pauses where softness gathered around scrubs. The parcel labels lay in a sealed envelope on the shelf like teeth in a child’s pocket, tidy and unhelpful. Handwriting analysis had come back with the sort of truth she had learned to hate: male, educated in a tradition, patient hand, no tremor, inconsistency in Bulgarian diacritics that suggested either provincial school or a language learned in love rather than in a classroom. She thought of her grandmother’s hand on a shopping list, the way she made small hearts when she meant dots, and she thought of men who learned to write again when they learned to love again, and she rubbed the bridge of her nose until her vision hummed.

It was Zora who found the print shop that remembered a man who bought white labels and asked for string that would not bleed when wet. The shop had a bell that rang like a bicycle and a proprietor who painted her own nails with correction fluid and then told you how long it took to dry. She told the inspector about a small man with a careful face who smelled faintly of cloves and something metallic, like pennies in the stew, and who had asked if the red paper hearts came in a smaller size because the lamp he had at home did not deserve large hearts. “He asked if I had mint tea,” the woman said, gesturing toward a kettle as if it were a suspect. “I told him this is a print shop, not your auntie’s kitchen. He laughed without using his teeth. I do not like it when people laugh without their teeth.”

The vicar wrote her letter-back with the sincerity of a person cutting bread for someone who has said they are not hungry. In the sacristy, the mint sachet perfumed the room as if a field had been compressed into a pocket and could be unfolded if you only breathed the right way. She thanked him for the labels, for the practice of letting go even if the letting was technical and the go was only paper. She asked him to practice something else, something that would make his hands ache in the soft places: escort someone home without being seen, and then do it again and do it again until the hunger that turned his fingers into collectors grew bored. She told him to choose a nurse and make himself the wind that pushed her towards safety without her noticing that the wind had a plan. She told him to bring her the story of the night in which he had interfered only by staying, and she did not sign her name because he already had it, the way he had the shape of her voice in his pocket.

He received the letter in his mouth before his hands, the idea of it arriving like the smell of soup in a stairwell tells you everything about the family you do not know. He did not open it straightaway because he respected the discipline of his own rituals and because respect pretended to be safety when it had nothing else to wear. He put the kettle on and then turned it off because boiling water made him think of hospital instruments and he would not think of instruments in his kitchen. When he finally unfolded the letter he did it with the care of someone unwrapping a wound, and he placed his palm flat on the paper to flatten the memory of its folds. Escort someone home, she had written, and he laughed because it was both too simple and too hard, a trick with eggs that leaves shells in the cake. He chose Irena because he knew the pattern of her weeks and because her ribbon had learned his wind.

He waited for her outside the cafeteria, in the slice of shadow between the machines that sold chocolate bars with souls and the poster that begged for blood with a font too friendly for the request. He stood as if he had been forgotten by a queue, head down, hands still, ledger open behind his eyes. She came out with her bag hooked like a second elbow, hair tight, mouth already deciding what to say to the woman who watched the building where her mother lived because the pipes were arguing with the winter. He followed her at a distance that felt like a translation: not too far to lose the meaning, not close enough to insult the grammar of her independence. Twice, dogs appeared with the affection of the poor, and he was ready with the whisper he had learned in his childhood to send dogs elsewhere without making them feel punished. Once, a man bumped her shoulder in a way that had been designed to bother, and Abhishek quickened his pace in a way that suggested that the street itself had decided to be less hospitable to the man in question, and the man drifted left instead of right and missed the bus he had meant to catch, and he would later tell his brother that the city had turned on him for reasons it had refused to state.

Irena felt something that night without naming it. She reached her door with the sense you have when you have done a sum in your head and are certain the answer is right without remembering the steps. She looked down at her ribbon and told it a joke about cows, and then she went inside and fed Slava four droplets of water because the cactus had become proud, and pride in a plant is a sign it knows something about light that you do not. She put her coat on the back of a chair with a sigh that would have disappointed her if she had listened to it. In the hallway, Abhishek stood with his hand on the banister like a man listening to timber, and for the first time since he had decided to make order of what he had lost he felt useful in a way that did not require refrigeration. He wrote in his notebook when he got home: Irena stumbled on the third step because the mop had lied. I did nothing, and it mattered. He underlined did nothing as if it were a sacrament new to him.

Zora began a small school in the parish hall for anyone who wanted to learn how to make noise. It was not self-defense in the way the posters meant or the videos with men in trousers too tight for wisdom. It was a class in shouting, in the way anger can be a bell, in the way a ribbon on a bag becomes a flag if you don’t let it become a decoration. She showed them how to drop their keys without dropping their courage, how to rewind their headphones enough to be useful but not so much that they strangled the world out. She taught the nurses to swing their elbows like the hinges they were, and to look at each other’s reflections in windows as if they could multiply their eyes. The hall echoed. A man from the pharmacy came because he had sisters and because he had a face that managed to be both open and barbed. Children drifted through and learned to shout without apology, and they went home and told their parents that God told them to be loud and the parents were horrified and then secretly relieved.

Inspector Boyanova kept her distance from the class because the sight of women preparing in a room with a crucifix felt like stepping into a shrine she had no right to inventory. She sent two officers who were good at being large without becoming the point and told them to practice appearing and then being unremarkable. She took the print shop woman’s description and a copy of the CCTV footage from a bus that had recorded a small man with a neat coat adjusting his gloves as if he were apologizing to them. She triangulated a circle on her map that included three bakeries, two cheap hardware stores, a pharmacy that sold the good plasters under the counter if you smiled, and a church that had accepted parcels without collapsing. She walked the circle with her hands in her pockets and her head bare to the cold because hats made her feel like a civilian.

The freezer spoke more than it used to when the building’s cables chattered during the evening surge where every stove in the block lit soup at once and everyone believed that chicken breast could be improved by lemon. Abhishek listened to the mutter of his appliance the way a mother listens to a child with a cough, counting breaths, evaluating rattles. He had bought dry ice from a man who sold novelty fog to discos and had dropped the foam into his sink with the glee of a magician who trusts science more than rabbits. The dry ice made the kitchen smell like the inside of a clean shirt, and for a moment he had felt like a person with a party to plan. He taped a new seal around the freezer’s door and wrote the date on it as if his life depended on its neatness. He lay on the floor and pressed his ear to the humming panel and imagined the tunnels beneath him, the red ribbon, the old heat. He imagined returning one box, then another, like a man dismantling an altar to a god who never asked to be worshipped. The thought made him dizzy with a fear that had nothing to do with prison and everything to do with who he’d be without the ritual.

What he had lost had been named before it had been born, a softness that had been given a syllable as a kind of hope and a kind of trap. He had loved a woman who kept her hair short because longer hair made people ask questions, a woman who pressed the life inside her as if it were a bruise that could be encouraged out. The hospital had been a place of paintings held on the cusp of tears, colors refusing to run, and the nurses had moved around them like hands on a loom, weaving something that would become the fabric of their getting-on-with-it. A doctor had said the word inevitable in a voice that made the word mean nothing and everything, and someone had told him to hold his breath and get on with it and then to breathe and get on with it and then to eat and get on with it, as if the verbs were chairs he would sit on until one broke beneath him and he could be forgiven for falling. He had not been forgiven, because he had not fallen in front of anyone. The woman with short hair had left with her own loss, because people do not always keep the same grief in the same drawer and they do not always want to know where yours is.

He took the vicar’s letter to bed like a child takes a torch under a blanket to read one more chapter. Her handwriting had changed because a hand learns the shape of the person it writes to, and she had made her loops wider, as if she were making him space. Practice escorting into a discipline, she had written, and he had. He followed Milena one night and stopped at the corner where a boy in a hood looked at her in the way wolves look at the snow when it holds prints. He waited until the boy’s eyes caught his, and then he made a face that he had learned from old men, a face that said I have lived long enough to be tired of you and therefore I will not be amused. The boy’s eyes dropped not because he had been afraid but because he had been bored, and he moved on, and Milena turned her key with a flick like a fish. He went home light and sick at once. He wrote a list of small interventions: a cracked paving stone he had memorized and stepped around, a bus driver he had greeted by name to slow him down for a woman running, a beggar he had given soup as if soup could do anything about the weather inside a person.

The saint’s day hung around the parish like a cologne that refused to admit it had worn off. Children still shook bells they had smuggled home in their pockets and were caught by mothers who recognized the sound of their own sins performed by their children at half the volume. Mr Mabie sat on the front step with a bowl of walnuts and cracked them with a stone because the parish had a way of arriving hungry and pretending otherwise. She watched the street like a reader finishing a book, knowing the last page would be a cliff and pretending until the second to last that there would be a tidy end. The letter he had sent after the tea on the bakery step was in her pocket, a paper that had collected the shape of her thigh like a lover’s head. He had written a paragraph about a woman’s hand adjusting a drip and making it look like music. He had written a confession so small you could have mistaken it for delight. He had written his name as A. and she had decided that the rest did not belong to her yet.

A woman from the radio called to ask for a quote about resilience and got a paragraph about the sacrament of boiling water. “People think resilience is a kind of laminate,” the vicar said, and then regretted her tone because she had sounded clever when what she wanted was to sound useful. “But really it’s soup. It’s knowing you can make something edible out of what you have and a heat source and salt. It’s an argument between hunger and patience.” The radio woman was quiet and then laughed because she had not expected hunger to become theology on a weekday, and she repeated it on air in a voice that made it sound like the city itself had spoken.

Niko organized whistles because whistles were cheaper than courage and easier to distribute. He placed them in a box at the nurses’ station with a hand-lettered sign that said Please take one and please do not chew it between patients, which made everyone laugh and then take one and tie it to their lanyards where they would forget it and then remember it when the wind managed to put its fingers down their backs. He walked Irena to her stop with a talk about his mother’s knee and the way cold weather made it rehearse the past. She told him that Slava had bloomed twice and that this meant nothing and everything, and they both were quiet after that because it had accidentally sounded like a prayer.

The inspector had found the building. She knew the building because buildings have a scent and this one had an aroma of bleach and oranges that made her think of school at the end of term and a clean prison with good intentions. She stood in the courtyard and listened hard. The plumbing throbbed. Someone laughed in a high flat because a television show had rediscovered a joke from the nineteen-eighties and rehearsed it. Somewhere a hum surprised her, a harmony to the city's background ache, and she moved toward it with the slow patience of a person who had found a fly in a cup and wanted it out without making anyone else imagine the cup differently when she offered tea. She stood outside a door and felt the sound in her ribs not because it was loud but because it was low, because hum lives in bone. She did not knock. She did not take out her phone. She put her hand flat on the door and the door told her nothing she could take to court.

Abhishek was inside, lying on the rug with his fingers laced behind his head like a man pretending to be a man on a beach. He had one ear on the floor and the other on the future, which is an unprofessional way to live but sometimes the only one that works. He felt the presence in the corridor like weather. He imagined the shape of a woman standing with her hand on his door and smelling of the kind of soap that insists it is unscented. He smiled to himself because being known with that precision was an intimacy he had not expected to enjoy. He did not get up. He thought instead of the old joke about saints’ days, where the saints looked down and shrugged, and he waited until the footsteps moved on, and when they did not he closed his eyes and pictured the vicar’s hands pressing salt poems into the rock.

The next letter was less a letter and more a map. He drew lines from bus stops to doorways in a hand that loved geometry even if it had never been rewarded for that fidelity. He marked the thresholds he had watched and the nights he had kept without stealing. He wrote a small truth about himself that he had not written before: I do not like salt, not because of taste, but because it remembers. He told her that in the tunnels there were places where old baths were sleeping and that if you hummed the correct note the tiles would hum back in a key your ear would not admit was music. He appended a scrap of paper with twelve names and a thirteenth left blank. He put the scrap in his pocket and went to the church and did not put it down because he could not yet imagine leaving a blank in someone else’s house.

He waited at the back and watched her shift her weight between feet in the way that confident speakers do when they are trying to be honest. He liked the way she did not try to be charming and was therefore forgiven for being interesting. People came up to her with their cherries and their griefs and their jokes, and she took all of them with the unstartled grace of a woman accustomed to being someone’s coat hook. He imagined bringing her an object that would change nothing and show everything, and he found himself almost reaching into his coat before a child tugged at his sleeve because children assume an adult’s clothing is a kind of petting zoo. He knelt and let the child examine the seam of his cuff, and he found himself soothing a small sorrow about a broken pencil that was in no way his business and for which he offered the solution of his own pencil stub.

“Thank you,” the child’s mother said, relieved by nothing and grateful anyway, and he straightened and looked at the vicar and felt the shame that attends tenderness when it arrives late to a life.

They met again at the bakery step because traditions form around the places where chairs are cheap and light is reliable. She watched him approach and saw that a decision had thinned his face. He looked like a man who had sold a coat to buy a better story and was trying not to be cold in the meantime. He handed her an envelope in a way that made both of their hands the same temperature for a second. Inside were photographs printed on cheap paper; he had taken pictures of the labels in his freezer as if taking pictures were a way to refuse to keep the originals. The names were shy on the page, their edges fuzzed by the printer’s need for a new ribbon. The photographs felt obscene only in the way that any archive feels obscene when it is a record of things that should have been allowed to remain unarchived.

“I think I can give you one,” he said, and his voice had cracked itself open to make room for what it would try to pass. “Not yours. Not the state’s. One back to one person. Perhaps that is a crack in the wall. Perhaps you will put pebbles in it instead of cement, and I will not understand, and that will be the lesson.”

“Perhaps,” she said, and she heard the careful skepticism in her own tone and did not soften it, because men who like rituals need resistance or they mistake themselves for a church. “If you do this, do it clean. I will not oversee a ceremony. There will be no midnight box on a step and no ribbon tied like an apology. You will walk into a place with light and people and you will put it on a table and you will say her name and you will let them look at your face as long as they need to, and then you will sit down and listen to a lot of things, most of them unkind.”

He nodded, and the nod had relief in it, the relief of being told exactly which hard road to take. He left with his hands empty, and the inspector across the street did not follow him, because she, too, had decided that practice should be allowed its repetitions until the body understood what the mind had already agreed.

Irena had started to talk to her hand as if it were an ornament she had accidentally stolen and now had to hide in plain sight. She told it the weather and the way the hospital’s roses had decided to bloom in the courtyard in a fashion that made the smokers laugh like villains in a cheap play. She polished the nails she had left with oil that smelled of oranges and stood in her kitchen watching Slava pretend to be a better plant than cactus as if ambition were plant food. When the knock came that evening, it made the hallway smell like neighbors who have practiced heart attacks and keystrokes, the way all knocks do when you are tired. Niko came up the stairs with a carton of eggs because his mother had send too many and because eggs are apologies in a carton. Behind him, at the edge of her door’s sightline, a small man waited with a steady posture that made the air collapse toward him.

“Excuse me,” he said, and Niko turned like a man who is prepared to become a larger animal instantly if the script requires it, and the man lifted his hands in the universal theatre gesture that means I have come with the intention of being boring. “I will use many words,” Abhishek said, and his voice did the humor of that sentence without being funny. “But first, a table. This deserves a surface.”

They went to the kitchen because kitchens are where people decide to be reasonable. He placed the box on the table with the gentleness you reserve for newborns and weapons. The box looked like nothing special until you knew and then you could not unknow it even if you wanted to teach your brain that trick. He had wrapped it with a dishcloth that had oranges on it, and Irena’s mouth made a shape without sound because memory has its own alphabet. He untied the knots without flourish and did not look at her hand because to admire would be to insult. He lifted the lid and the cold breathed its little white ghost and came to rest on the table, and Niko swore softly because softness is sometimes the only way to swear in a kitchen.

“I am sorry,” Abhishek said, and he sounded like a man speaking a phrase he had rehearsed in three languages and chosen the one that had the most vowels to cushion it. “I do not want forgiveness. I will not take it. I am only returning what was never mine. I will stay and listen. If you want,” he added, because consent is a practice too.

Irena did not cry. Her face learned a new geometry, and she looked at Niko and then at the cactus and then at the man in her kitchen and then at her own hands that trembled with the precision of muscles obeying orders. She reached out and put her palm on the lid and felt the cold find her like an address. She did not open it, because she did not have to; she knew what a box can and cannot give back. She laughed, which surprised her and them both, a laugh like a crack forming in ice because spring, not because pressure. “You brought a dishcloth,” she said, and she was grateful for the tiny ridiculous detail, because ridiculous details are mats you can kneel on. “Sit,” she added, and Niko looked at her like a man who had been given a job in a language he did not speak and was proud to perform wrong.

They sat until the tea boiled, and in the sitting something in the room’s air changed allegiance. Abhishek told a story about a door that had stuck and a neighbor who had oiled the hinge and how some noises you learn to love and some you learn to abolish. Irena told him about her mother’s cow again because ritual makes stories useful, and Niko offered an egg to the man who did not deserve it and therefore needed it more. When the box was opened, nobody looked directly. They looked at the edge of the thing, the way people look at eclipses with makeshift viewers and the knowledge that their eyes are worth more than their curiosity. Abhishek did not reach and he did not instruct. He watched the way the air shuddered and then lay down.

The police were called after. They arrived with a correctness that made the room grow a spine. Inspector Boyanova stepped in last and did not make herself the axis of anything. She sat, because sitting is a way to say I am here to do a job and the job has rules. She did not arrest him, not that night, because he had brought a thing back and she was superstitious about momentum, and because handcuffs in a kitchen join too many objects with that same sound. She took statements like knitting, letting the yarn go where it preferred while her fingers coaxed it into patterns. She asked him for his name and he gave it, the whole of it, and she wrote Abhishek slowly, because she did not want to put an extra letter into a man where it did not belong.

Later, after the box had been collected and the table cleared and Slava had pretended not to notice any of it, the inspector stood on the stairs with the vicar and the night like a shawl. “You have your practice,” she said to Mr Mabie, and there was no bitterness in it, which surprised both of them.

“It takes,” the vicar said, and she did not explain whether she meant the practice or the sorrow or the lesson. She looked down at her thumbs and thought of salt writing a poem she had not yet dared to read.

Abhishek went home with the sound of the box lid in his ears, that small plastic acceptance of air, and he walked like a man translated into his mother tongue. He put his hands flat on the freezer and felt it hum like a lullaby that had learned a second verse. He opened the door and looked at the neat teeth of labels and thought of the altar rail with the names laid out like a grammar. He took one square out and held it in his palm and whispered to it the way someone says goodbye to the last piece of candy in a bowl. He put it back and shut the door gently, and then he turned the dial one notch toward quiet.

He slept and dreamt of tunnels where the tiles sang back in a key he could not name, where red ribbon fluttered in an air that had not moved since before he came to this city with his careful hunger. In the dream the vicar stood waist-deep in water that did not decide to drown, and she handed him a small frog with a crown that turned out to be a ring he had not earned, and he laughed and woke with that laugh still in his mouth and could not tell if his throat was raw from it or from the cold.

In the morning, parcels arrived across the city that contained nothing but labels peeled from jam jars, women’s handwriting with shapes like hills and men’s block capitals that refused flourish. People had misunderstood the vicar’s sermon on purpose, the way flocks do when the field on the other side of the fence looks greener and the fence has only suggestions for keeping. They had sent their own names to the altar, a practice of saying here I am with glue still sticky. Zora piled them and then made them into a banner across the nave, names touching names in a long declaration that looked like laundry and felt like a census. The radio woman came and put her microphone up like you put a hand under a bird, careful not to spook. Children traced the letters they recognized and made educated guesses about the ones they did not, which is also a form of prayer.

At the hospital, Irena’s ribbon had begun to fray in a way that made it more beautiful and less symbolic. Niko had a whistle burn on his lower lip where he had blown too hard during a practice he treated like a rehearsal for a burial. Milena forgot to hum when she washed her hands and then remembered and hummed a song that someone had sung about a frog at a wedding, and the hum made the ward seem suddenly domestic, as if a kitchen were available if only someone opened the correct door. A new nurse arrived, young enough to be admired as a solution, and she tied her hair in a way that said she was not interested in being a problem and would be anyway. She tied a red ribbon around her wrist because the ribbon has become fashion, and there are worse fashions.

Boyanova wrote the report that would not make anyone feel safer and sent it the way you send a letter to someone you will only meet at their funeral. She wrote that a return had begun, that practice had been performed, that boxes would be boxes until they were not. She wrote that a man had given his full name and that perhaps it was the city’s turn to introduce itself properly to the parts of itself it had always refused to keep track of. She wrote that she would arrest him soon, because that is what the state does with men who make private rituals public, and she wrote that she would bring him tea when she did because she had no interest in pretending to be more steel than she was bone.

In the afternoon, a bus driver placed his hand on the steering wheel and spoke softly to it, a habit he had not confessed to anyone because it made him feel old and tender. He saw a small man run too late toward the stop and felt the impulse to stop even though the schedule would punish him, and he stopped, and the man did not get on because the man had stopped too, distracted by the sight of a woman in scrubs and a ribbon crossing the street with a sandwich and a book under her arm as if she had decided to borrow the city from itself for a few steps. The driver laughed and pulled away and thought of the mint sachet he kept in his breast pocket and of the vicar who had looked tired and bright at once when she had asked him to keep looking.

Night returned with its crate of noises, and the freezer hummed and the tunnels carried their sleeping warmth, and above them the city practiced and practiced whatever it was that would one day become habit. Abhishek stood at his window with the paper hearts motionless because the air refused to move and he imagined learning the trick of loving without adding anything to the world except vigilance. He pressed his thumb to the glass and left a print that looked like a moon rising over lines that had been left by someone else’s cleaning. He wondered whether he had already chosen and whether choosing again was allowed. He thought of the vicar’s anchor and of salt and of the way the word darling tastes if you say it too often in an empty room. He did not go to the freezer, not that night. He tied a length of red ribbon to his notebook and to the handle of his door, not as a charm but as an acknowledgement, and he slept with the window cracked so that any humming in the street would be invited in and given a chair.Chapter 6

The thaw did not announce itself with trumpets. It slid in under doors and rested its wet head on the city’s knee until the city, distracted, patted it and called it spring. Snow retreated from the gutters like shy animals and left behind a sediment of cigarette ends and grit and the lid of a jar someone had been certain would be useful. Sofia smelled of metal warming and earth remembering. The river looked less like a caution and more like a mirror with bad lighting. People took off one layer and carried it in proud confusion, proving with their elbows that they had survived another winter.

At the hospital, the radiators stopped their righteous clanking and settled into a hum of civil service. Someone put a dish of cut lemons on the nurses’ station because it made the air taste honest. A woman came in with a jar of pickled peppers and tried to barter it for an appointment and the receptionist, who had been trained in several kinds of bureaucracy and also in motherhood, said the peppers were welcome but the appointment would require a card and a patience that outlived hunger. In the chapel corner of the ward, someone had hung a red ribbon on the oxygen cylinder as a joke and someone else had untied it in a panic and someone had tied it back on lower, acknowledging both truths at once.

Inspector Boyanova relinquished her hat to the morning and let her hair think for her while she stood by the board and moved pins with a tenderness that would have surprised anyone who imagined her life as the purchase of facts and the return of missing objects to their hard places. The print shop proprietor had given her another description in exchange for a promise to use her for official posters if the police ever wanted to warn people with a font that refused to be frightened. The CCTV loops had yielded nothing she could sell to a courtroom, but they had given her several small comforts: a man’s habit of dampening his thumbs on his tongue before turning a page, a woman steadying herself on the bus with minimal knuckles, a driver looking at the mirror and catching his own eye and liking himself a little. In the corner, the envelope of labels sat like a well-behaved animal awaiting instruction. She had written his name in her notebook as if the act of writing had built a bridge to him, and she had underlined it and then stared at the underline until it seemed to her that the line was a small road someone could walk.

Zora turned the parish hall into an instruction manual for resilience that had no pictures and therefore demanded imagination. She drew a map of the neighborhood on a sheet of paper so large it made everyone kinder to each other, because when a place is enormous you are less likely to step on your neighbor’s block. She circled the bakery and the bus stops and the corners that enjoyed their own shadows and wrote next to them in a hand that had worked for decades and refused to become pretty: Here shout. Here run. Here wait. She taught women with wrists that had learned a new caution how to reclaim their elbows as punctuation. She told them that if you say Stop with your whole belly, the air will part; if you say it with your throat, you will choke. The laughter in the hall had a workshop’s sound, not entertainment so much as focused relief. Mr Mabie moved among them with a bowl of sunflower seeds and an eye for the person who was practicing too hard because practice can be a way to avoid a task that has nothing to do with muscle and everything to do with saying yes when your brain shouts no.

The vicar wrote a set of prayers for hands and then laughed at herself and tore them up and started again with a pencil. The first set had been respectable and a little proud of its weaving of scripture and soap. The second set was less beautiful and more useful, a list of verbs: carry, lift, bind, hold, mend, point, refuse, bless, punch if you have to. She wrote one line for the absent parts: return. She visited three old women who had been young when bread lines led to marriages and taught their grandchildren to pack sandwiches as if they were storing summer in paper. She came back to the church with a bag of walnuts and the news that one of the old women had decided to forgive the city its rumors because rumors are the only currency some people have and she did not want to make anyone poorer.

Abhishek discovered that the city’s hunger for light was contagious. He opened his curtains as if he were letting a tame animal onto the balcony. The paper hearts above the lamp turned slower now that the windows were not tight against the cold; their shadows moved like thoughts even when no one looked. He wiped the condensation line off the glass with a sleeve and felt pleased by the streak he left, a proof of presence he could remove later in a flourish. He stood by the freezer and listened to its pitch, which had been altered by the building’s new warmth. He turned the dial back to where it had been and the hum deepened into something his sternum acknowledged like an old tune. He placed his palm flat and felt the memory of cold climb into him as if his body had been practicing a door trick. He took out a square and placed it on the counter and then put it back with the care of a librarian replacing a book on a shelf he could find in the dark with two fingers.

In his notebook he wrote, in the deliberate hand of a man undoing a spell by naming its ingredients: escorting is a practice, like chopping. He listed occasions: Milena, two nights; Sisi, once, a detour away from a man who collected conversations like stamps; Dessislava, none yet, because she had a bicycle and her speed mocked his care. He wrote for the first time a line that did not name a woman: Inspector Boyanova, outside my door, did not knock; knows the hum by heart; did not betray the ritual back to itself. He underlined did not as gratitude and instruction. He wrote, in a smaller hand that looked like a child’s apology: I wonder if she is tired of being correct in rooms that act as if correctness were a small vice.

He took the vicar’s last letter from the freezer and let it thaw on the table merely to watch the paper return to its old self. The fibres expanded with a reluctance he recognized. He spread it with his fingers until it lay flat without memory. The part where she had written black tea went cold in this house before it tells the truth made him smile; the part where she had written The altar is not a place for trophies made him wince for the second time. He wrote back with a new honesty that made his neck feel as if a collar were tightening, that polite panic of a shirt chosen too quickly in a dim morning. He wrote that he had returned one and that the room had not collapsed and that he was disoriented by the survival of furniture. He wrote that perhaps it would be better if he did not enter the church with a box and a statement like a man posing as a lesson. He wrote that he was tempted to deliver each piece in a kitchen, where hands are meant to take what is offered, and that he would listen and be hurt and be called names and accept what language had saved up for him. He asked her to tell him why he felt the freezer deserved a goodbye ritual.

She did not oblige him completely because she mistrusted answers that satisfied, but she gave him a measure. She wrote that every object used for a harm acquires a superstition and that the ritual of unmaking has power not because objects listen but because people do. She wrote that she had once boarded up a window where a boy had been found bruised and small and then, when the window had been replaced, had returned and sung singing games in the new light with children who would not have memorized the first boy’s geometry if not for the song. She wrote that the freezer was not evil, only employed, and that a thing becomes neutral again when it has held enough bread. She told him, lightly because weight can bruise, that he might buy ice pops for children in summer with the same attentive hands and that she would, if God gave her the audacity, bless the freezer with salt.

The return to Irena’s kitchen had not generated confession in the way the police would have hoped, but it had made a new kind of loud. The ward eyes changed how they held the space behind their backs. A patient who had been a stonemason before drink had turned his wrists into radios no longer tuned to labor watched the nurses with a respect that embarrassed him into silence. Niko found himself whistling in the stairwell, less a signal than an admission that he liked the way the stairwell made his breath into music. He bought another carton of eggs because gratitude had turned into a habit and he could not think of another shape for it. Slava, the cactus, produced a bud that looked like a punchline no one was yet brave enough to say aloud.

Rumors grew a new branch. A parcel had been left on the steps of a school and it had contained a broken clock and a note that said Time heals nothing, we do. It was not his handwriting. Someone with clumsy velocity had decided to join the chorus. The inspector’s jaw went tender with irritation. Copying is a way of refusing to invent and it endangers precision. She walked to the school and watched children run their complicated games that reorganize the laws of motion for a few minutes at a time and she thought about the discipline required to arrest a thief of gestures in a city built on borrowed rhythms. She left without scolding because the city does not respond well to being told to be less itself.

A meeting was arranged between the inspector and the vicar and a man from the ministry whose suit had been cut to a different season. They sat in the church, because the inspector refused the ministry’s rooms on principle and because the ministry’s tea burned like a secret. They sat on mismatched chairs and distributed their weight as if the chairs had feelings. The ministry man used phrases like narrative control and the inspector’s mouth went into a shape that could be mistaken for politeness by someone who had never seen her actually be polite. He wanted statements. He wanted an ending he could hand to the radio woman with only adjectives as garnish. The vicar said endings were for books and medicine and that people did not end apart from their breathing. The inspector said she would arrest him when he came to be arrested and not before, and the ministry man made a sound like cutlery in a drawer and said the city needed a spectacle. The vicar said the city had already had too many and besides, spectacles take both hands and she wasn’t in the business of tying anyone up unless they asked nicely and even then she would interview them first. The ministry man’s ears grew the pink of contained embarrassment and he left promising resources, which meant he would send a form.

That night, the tunnels were busier than their history preferred. Teenagers with torches and an appetite for photos took their dare across old heat and renewed dust. They found Zora’s ribbon and respected it the way you respect a sign that looks homemade and therefore more serious. They found a bath where tiles refused to fall even when they had been abandoned for decades and they took pictures and posted them with captions that tried to be droll and landed somewhere near devotional. They heard the hum, and because they were too young to know how to recognize an appliance by sound they thought it was the city’s background tune and they loved their home more for being able to make music without trying.

Abhishek dreamed in bright daylight for the first time since he had made the freezer his complicit heart. He dozed in a chair with the newspaper folded against his knee like a sleeping cat and his head snapped forward when the radiator hiccuped, and in that little jolt he saw the ritual of taking and keeping as a tunnel he had decorated so well he had forgotten how to climb out. He wrote upon waking: one box to the inspector at her window, in daylight, in front of people who are leaving a bus and thinking of soup. He wrote, daring himself and then immediately wanting a second hand to press his map flat: unplug. He underlined it and felt his pulse applaud and accuse.

The day he chose was ordinary in a way that made it a good stage. Clouds like plates. Buses with their usual wounds. At the depot, the drivers played their valedictory round of cards and let a queen slip as a superstition against fatalities. On Shipka Street, a woman unknown to the church except for her neighbor’s gossip lit a candle and asked for help with her son’s exams as if exams had souls that could be moved to mercy. Mr Mabie wrote a list on the back of a receipt: bread, soap, patience, ribbon, mint if kindness catches me, matches, courage if the shop stocks it. She went to the shop and bought two of each of the ordinary items and no courage because the shop did not pretend. Zora oiled the hinges on the vestry door because she liked it when objects agreed with her.

He did not write the inspector a letter. He did something harder. He walked to her building at the minute he had learned her patrol ended and her shuffling of papers began, and he stood on the pavement holding a box with no disguise, a plainness that felt radical. He was not performing. He looked like a man who had body and task and no costume fit for either. The building itself was unimpressive in the way buildings designed to humble their occupants usually are. He waited until a woman with a plant on her windowsill leaned forward and then backward and then forward again, and he raised his head the way a man raises it to swallow medicine. When the inspector opened the door, she kept her hand on the knob because she was old-fashioned and knew that people behave better when they are reminded of furniture. He handed her the box. He did not say a speech. He said, “This is two,” and she took it and she nodded and the nod contained several religions worth of ritual. She passed the box back to an officer with hands that were making a point of being gentle.

They did not cuff him. She asked if he would come inside. He asked if the room had a window. She said yes and the window was dirty. He said then it is honest and stepped in. The officer with the gentle hands said his name. He put his palms on the table like a promise and the inspector placed a cup in front of him that had once held coffee and now held only water and a reputation. He answered questions in a way that made the room warmer. He did not dramatize. He spoke of practice like a craftsman. He told them about the label machine and the way the tape produced a little tail and how he trimmed it because untidiness had begun to equal danger to him in a way that meant his body had been solving its own equation without his permission. He told them about Irena’s dishcloth, the oranges, and the way his hands had her memory on them now the way salt writes poems when you wait. He spoke of the dream that had the frog. He spoke of his loss without details because he was not sure if the details would be a kindness to him or to the room. He said he would take them to the freezer, not tonight, but soon, because it would take a small piece of choreography to make the unmaking safe. The inspector said no choreography, just light and people, and he nodded because the word safe meant different things on different floors of the same building.

Word got out because nothing good or bad ever stays in the box the city wants to keep it in. People spoke of it with the precision of hope and the sloppiness of fear. Someone said he had carried the box on his head like a porter returning from a long walk, which was untrue and beautiful, and the story improved for a few minutes and made two women smile at their own imaginations. Someone else said he had thrown the box at the inspector and she had caught it with a single contemptuous hand, which was untrue and made the inspector’s jaw tighten on behalf of the nobility of both objects and hands. The radio woman did not know whether to call it surrender, which sounded like an opera, or cooperation, which sounded like a memo. She called it a development and let the word hang in the air until a peacock could have perched on it if Sofia had owned any.

Niko took his mother’s whistles and ordered more. He told the nurses he had stood next to the man and had felt nothing except fatigue, which was true only in one leg and even then only because the stairs at Irena’s building had a way of taking more steps than they delivered. He did not express the way the man’s presence had made the room into a place where he had had to decide what manner of man he was, the way children and crimes do. Irena looked at her hand and said to it, without irony and without a smile, you are home. She opened a jar of pickles and the sound the seal made was the smallest celebration she allowed herself. Slava leaned into the sun as if it had engaged to visit and she didn’t want to be rude.

The night before the unmaking, because the whole city knew what it was without the police or the vicar naming it, Mr Mabie walked the neighborhood with a small bag of salt and a stick of chalk. She drew a fish on a corner where a small boy had once fallen from his scooter without dignity and recovered without boasting. She put a cross under the bus stop bench because once a woman had slept there and woken without her breath and the bench had held her like a proper thing and had not complained. She drew a ship on a door because inside a man and a woman were learning to argue without contempt and that is what ships are for: transport without drowning. She came home and put the salt in a bowl and thought about the freezer and said out loud, without blasphemy and without apology, that she would bless it, and God could send a memo if He had objections.

Abhishek sat on the floor and took inventory. Not of objects. Of reasons. He spoke them into the room as if speech could make them appear less heavy in his hands. He said the words as a list: loss, custody, order, gratitude, vanity, ritual, love, terror, pride, tidiness, faith. He noted which ones still looked him in the eye. He unplugged the lamp with the paper hearts and then plugged it back in because he found himself superstitious about shadows and it amused him. He went to the freezer and he put his hand to the dial and turned it one notch toward silence. He waited. He counted. He thought of the vicar’s salt and of the inspector’s window. He turned it again and the hum lowered. He did it in thirds, like a man descending stairs in the dark with a friend he is not sure he can catch.

When the hum ceased, the room did not become silent. New sounds rushed to fill the vacuum like neighbors bearing casseroles to a house where grief has taken up residence. The building pipes took the opportunity to praise themselves. Someone upstairs practiced three notes on a violin and called it a song. A stray dog’s collar clinked against its dish. His own breath embarrassed him with its importance. He rested his forehead against the top of the freezer and took the ritual seriously. “Thank you,” he said, and he meant the usefulness. “You have kept my worst idea tidy,” he said, and his voice made the lid vibrate faintly. “I will find you a better job.”

In the morning, people went to work without drama because drama is expensive and morning is stingy. The police did not rush. They gathered their forms and their patience and a van that smelled of rope and sweat and a hope for dullness. The vicar put the salt in her pocket and told Zora to bring the red ribbon for the door handle and a cloth that did not pretend to be anything except clean. She looked at her hands and thought of all the objects hands have been asked to sanctify and to ruin and decided that today they would operate like an orchestra that can play softly enough to make you weep in a room full of people pretending to be dry-eyed.

They walked together, not as procession, not as spectacle, but as errand. The inspector in front because this was her kind of door. The vicar a step back because she was in the business of thresholds and knew when to let other people knock. Zora behind with the cloth and the ribbon like a woman intent on helping a friend move house. The stairwell smelled of onion and eucalyptus. A child’s bike had been leaned against the wall in a show of trust in gravity. A cat watched with the contempt of a being that knows you cannot arrest anyone without also arresting yourself. They stopped at the door and listened, because listening is a skill that refuses applause. Inside, a chair scraped. The inspector knocked like a person who expects to be obeyed because she has chosen her reasons. The door opened like a person who expects to be surprised and is prepared to treat surprise as a courtesy.

Abhishek stood there with his neck bare and a cardigan that made him look more like a neighbor than a headline. He had a box in his hands and his face had the look faces wear when they have been rehearsing calm and have almost succeeded. The room behind him was orderly without bragging. The lamp with hearts was still and the hearts looked like punctuation, not romance. He stepped back because the invitation was the only power he wanted to claim. The inspector entered with the expression of someone checking a friend’s kitchen for knives because the friend has a habit of cutting fruit directly in the air. The vicar went to the freezer because an object, when it is about to be unmade, deserves the mercy of a familiar face.

The seal around the door had been new, the tape marked with dates in a hand that did not lie. The dial was at quiet. The hum had been absent long enough for the room’s air to remember its own cadence. “May I?” she asked, and he nodded, and the inspector nodded too because law and ritual overlap in surprisingly few places and she had learned to see when they did. The vicar laid the cloth over the lid for a moment, not touching, as if covering a body for a night before the washing. She sprinkled three pinches of salt, small enough to be invisible, because a handful would have been absurd and an insult to the object’s dignity. She said words that made no sense to anyone else because she was not yet ready to share them. She lifted the cloth and folded it because folding is an act of respect no one can argue with and then she put her hand on the handle and lifted.

Cold sighed into the room with the modesty of a friend arriving late. Inside, the order made a sound in the throat like commentary and she swallowed it. The labels were neat. The squares were in their teeth’ row. An empty space where the returned one should be declared itself without drama. Abhishek stood with his hands at his sides, palms forward slightly, the body’s confession. He began to speak the names, halting once where a diacritic demanded attention and he obliged it. The inspector wrote nothing. Zora stood with the ribbon watching the vicar’s mouth as if to learn a chant she could use in case of fire.

They did not remove everything at once, because any ritual that pretends instant clarity is lying for an audience. They took two, closed the lid, let the air adjust. The inspector bagged them as if tenderness were a job description, the labels showing through the fog of plastic like teeth on a child behind glass. Abhishek walked to the window and placed his thumbprint on the glass again and was relieved to see it, a proof of body at precisely the moment when the state was making ready to inventory his breath. He did not resist when the inspector lifted his wrist and he let the plastic circle itself there with a click that sounded exactly like what it was. The vicar tied the red ribbon on the freezer handle until it looked dressed for a solemn holiday. The cat watched and yawned.

Down the stair, the building listened. The elderly woman on the third floor who had once said her son was clever and unnecessary took the kettle off before it screamed. A boy whose bicycle knew the stairs better than his shoes held his breath through three steps and then forgot to be dignified. A door opened and closed at the exact second the party passed, not in fear but in that old Balkan tradition of privacy that is also politeness. Outside, the van waited in an unflattering color.

On Shipka Street, the bells were late because a teenager had slept through his alarm and run to the rope with his laces untied and the bells themselves laughed in their metal way and rang like the city needed to be told to sit still. People turned to watch the little procession that was not a procession. Some frowned and then decided they had left the gas on. Some made a mental note to tell someone that the vicar had a cardigan with a hole in the cuff and that made her more trustworthy. A woman from the radio arrived too late to pretend she had been there all along. She recorded the sound of the bells instead and used it later as if bells had opinions.

At the station, a room had been prepared that did not pretend to be anything except a room where questions are asked and answered, sometimes in that order. Abhishek sat and looked at the window and did not look at the camera because he preferred to believe that only people were watching. The inspector laid out, not with flourish but with respect, the paperwork that would collect him into the state. She told him how it would go because people deserve schedules even when the day is not kind. He told her he had unplugged the freezer and it was the most dangerous thing he had done and she said then you are a man who has not been on certain floors of certain buildings and he almost smiled. He said, “There is a frog in this story and I do not know what to do with it,” and the inspector made a mark on the paper near the words personal history and did not, to her credit, ask about the frog.

In the church, Zora hung the ribbon from the sacristy key and the parish came in the afternoon with jars of jam with their labels peeled off, with jars of jam with new labels that had jokes on them, with jars of nothing at all because a jar is its own promise. Mr Mabie spoke a prayer for objects that have done harm and would now be asked to do good—tongs that had once lifted war bread and now would turn sausages at a picnic, a rope that had once tied down fear and now could be used to anchor a child’s swing, a freezer that would be fed bread and fish and ice pops in a summer that had already begun to practice. Children ran bells across the pew backs until Zora pretended to be angry, and they believed her, because she was a woman who made anger as nourishing as stew.

In the evening, after the paperwork had learned his name and the small cupboard had learned his clean habits, the inspector brought him tea that had clearly taken a tour of the kettle before arriving and he thanked it with a theatricality that made her grin without meaning to. She asked him why he had left the paper hearts. He said the hearts were for light and the freezer had been for dark and he had decided that it was time to make them argue out loud. She told him he was going to be called many names before the city decided which one to settle on for its own convenience. He said he knew. She told him the vicar had blessed his appliance. He laughed with genuine shock, and for the first time that day he looked younger than his carefulness.

Night came down not as punishment but as permission. In the flat, the freezer sat with its ribbon like a bride who had chosen her own dress. The hum did not return. The room learned a new equilibrium. Somewhere else, in the tunnels, the old baths hummed back the notes teenagers had practiced without knowing, and the ribbon Zora had tied moved because an air older than the city had decided to turn over in its sleep. On Shipka Street, the bells rested and the ropes hung with the relief of work finished for the day. The vicar lay in bed and thought of salt and labels and the softness of the inspector’s mouth when it pretended to be made of iron. Irena held her hand up in the dark and said goodnight to it with more courtesy than she had offered herself in years. Niko took a whistle out of his pocket in bed and then put it back again because the sound was not for night.

Abhishek did not sleep much because release has moved into the room and was being a poor houseguest, pacing and opening the cupboards and asking if there were biscuits. He went, in the useful hours between one and three, through the inventory of his own body: feet that had walked a city like a pencil drawing its outline, knees that had learned the stairs of buildings he would forget at once, thighs that had remembered to bend for kindness, hips that had been made into shelves for boxes with the carelessness of a ritual, a spine that had held disciplines like a clothesline holds shirts and their creases, shoulders that had failed and had forgiven themselves for failing, hands that had learned a wrong prayer and now would be asked to unlearn, thumbs that had been turned into priests and would become thumbs again. He dozed and woke with the feeling that he had left a window open and found that he had not, and this offended his sense of metaphor, and then amused him in a way he wished he could explain to someone who liked him enough to enjoy his jokes.

In the morning he stood at the cell window and watched the men cross the yard with their hands in their pockets because cold still liked to audition for spring. Beyond the wall, a bus sighed into a stop and the driver pulled his shoulders in and out like a man trying to decide whether to be an accordion. He put his thumb to the glass and did not leave a print because the state had learned a better soap. He thought of the vicar’s list of verbs. He thought of return like a boat at last pointing at the pier. He thought of practice, permanent. He hoped that the freezer would like fish. He hoped for ice pops with ridges that matched the mouths of children. He said, to no one listening and everyone, “I am practicing,” and the day outside got on with it.
