The moor kept its own calendar. The heather had just turned, a purple tide contagious, run up to the edges of the old quarry and the blind eye of the reservoir, and the wind lied and said winter was nowhere near. Night worked faster than clocks above Marsden and Holmebridge and the little stitched villages that ran like hem along the valley seam past Huddersfield, and ink was pouring into the sky by the time Tom Scarr left the Stone Tap and cut up the trackless part, too stubborn to wait for the late bus or for his mate to finish his pint. He had new boots and a lump of pride. Curlew serrated the silence. Somewhere a lamb coughed like an old man.

He saw the first lilac smear on the stile where the stone pinched. He ran his finger over it and it came away with a smear that smelled like something from an old tin in a painter’s shed, and something of flowers, and something not right. Tom rubbed it against his jeans to be rid of it, and the stain turned darker in the denim, like a bruise press. The moon was only an eyelash but it was enough to turn the ruts silver. When the voice came, it came as if out of the stone.

“Lost?”

He turned, laughed. “You making fun? I live twenty minutes that way.”

“Almost nobody lives twenty minutes that way,” the voice said, as if it were tasting the shape of the words. “In any case, you’re walking on my edge.”

“You mean this’s your land? Didn’t think anyone owned up here,” Tom said, squinting, trying to gauge where the voice hid. In the dark you can get the impression words come from the ground like steam. It was only when he edged along the wall that he caught the shape, a knot of shadow that wasn’t a wall, that had angles and the suggestion of a face that had gone through fire or through too much meanness.

“Everything’s owned,” said the shadow, softly. “Even air. Even you.”

Tom laughed again, tried to make it just a drunk lad’s bravado stripped for the moor. “All right, mate. Good night.”

“What color,” the voice asked, “are you under your clothes?”

“What?”

“I asked,” the voice said, and moved. Tom saw, for a mad second, hands that weren’t the size of any man’s hands, long-fingered, the nails like bits of flint. A cap? No, a head that sat too low on shoulders, ears like torn leaves, eyes that caught the eyelash moon and made mirrors of it. He was not a small man. He was not a man. “What color are you?”

Tom swore and stepped back. “Get—push off.” His heel missed the top step of the stile, and he windmilled, the stupid ache of the pub suddenly gone. The last thing he was sure of, sure enough to carry, was the smell. Oil. Lilac. Earth that had never seen light. After that the moor clasped him like kin and the heather closed and the wind went back to lying.

By five in the morning the hens in Follybridge Yard were doing their soft gossipy mutterings, and the old collie knew the difference between those and trouble and didn’t lift his head. The cows steamed in the wet breath of dawn. Lady Follybridge had been out since half-five, and the Lady was which part and the Follybridge was which part depended on who you asked in Holmebridge, but if you asked her, she would tell you that Lady was only a legal sticker on the back of a boot, and the rest was cows and rents and hedges and the bleeding tractor that always conked when it chose and never when she had the time. She walked the line of the east field and saw the gap where the wall had tumbled and the sheep had no business even thinking of slipping through, but had. She clicked her tongue, muttered, “No no no,” like she could put the stone back with voice alone, and then fetched a barrow and set to.

She was taller than people remembered, because her grandmother had been small and fierce and had taught the village to expect a small fierce Follybridge and not a tall one with hair the mud color and hands that had not found a glove that didn’t lose a finger within a week. “Lyd,” called her grandfather from the oak by the lane, because he was the only one allowed to cut her name down to Lyd. “You eat?”

She looked up, saw him an assemblage of tweed and scarf and old man stubbornness, his stick held like a conductor’s baton. “Tea,” she called back.

“That’s for saints and liars. Bring the mug when you pass.”

She put a last stone on the top of the wall and wiped her hands on her jeans. When she pushed the barrow back over the field the sun had finally made the sky a color you could call something—washed copper maybe. She handed the old man a mug. He made a face like she’d given him vinegar.

“They said at the shop there’s another missing,” he said, without preamble.

“Who’s they?”

“They is the plural of Hazel at the post office. Which, in fairness, Hazel is the plural of herself. She knows the train times in Leeds and whether the chemist’s cat has worms and when young lads don’t go home at the usual time.”

Lyd leaned her hip against the tree and drank her own tea. “Missing how?”

“As lads go missing that haven’t remembered to ring their mums. He’s called something bite-your-tongue modern like Jase or Ryley. He didn’t come home after the Tap. His mum’s worked herself raw calling friends and they do a sweep of the moor they do. Police drop in and say words that taste of bureaucracy.”

“It was just talk before,” Lyd said. “You know that.” But the memory of last month’s flapping leaflets and voices pitched a notch higher than gossip would go; not names. Boys between seventeen and twenty-three. If you were older you were invisible. If you were a woman the danger had a different shape. “Hazel says paint,” old Alfred added, and looked at her over the edge of his mug.

“Paint?”

“Lilac.” He said it like it was a dirty word. “Daubed on the Kirkgate underpass, daubed on the stile by Black Hagg. She says it’s…some kind of, what do you call it, a calling card. Kids, says the copper. Kids with nothing better to do than play at spectres.”

“Your generation invented spectres and wrote them songs and sold tickets,” Lyd said. The old man smiled and took that for the peace offering it was.

She had cows to see and then a tractor to cajole, but under that her day suddenly had a second skin. It itched. When she went into the kitchen with its isthmus of a table and its chalkboard with a week’s meals that would never stick to their proper days, she saw the note in Hazel’s handwriting folded under the salt. A neighbor woman, all elbows and heart, had dropped it in the night because she knew Lady Follybridge would see it and not crumple into panic but move. Search party, 10 a.m., outside the hall. Bring whistles, dogs, torches, wear high-vis, don’t step into holes. Don’t go alone.

She looked at the clock and what it gave her back was permission to skip the tractor at least until this afternoon. She might have gone alone even with that last line, stubbornness has its own syntax, but the thought of three boys laid over one another like bad lines in a story sat on her chest and forced her to think of air. “I’ll go,” she said aloud to the empty kitchen, and the old collie thumped his tail as if she had said walk. “You’ll stay,” she added, and he sank back with a sigh the whole house had learned to copy.

The hall was a rectangle of stone and warm dust and had seen weddings and funerals and fund-raisers for the rugby team, and this morning it saw the small army of ordinary people who come when you say someone is missing. Lyd took a clipboard and a whistle and tried to see if there was anyone shaped like leadership. There wasn’t, but there was Ellen from the school who knew maps, and there was PC Uddin with a face of professional calm that looked like a mask she had to hold in place with her jaw. “We’re not in panic country,” PC Uddin said, to the room and to herself. “We are in the first hours when it matters. We spread out, lines, and we keep our eyes open. We watch where our feet go. We don’t assume, and we write down what we see. Okay?”

Lyd caught her at the door. “Hazel’s note said paint.”

The policewoman’s mouth pressed thin. “We are taking that seriously.”

“What color?”

“Lilac,” PC Uddin said, and it would have been a harmless color in any other sentence. “Try Wessenden first,” she added. “The rest of the team’s starting south.”

They formed ladders of people and took the moor in teeth. Lyd’s line walked east of Black Moss, and she laced her boots tighter than usual and found that the moor hissed under her steps like an old record. She learned the smell of the paint before she saw it: synthetic sweet. It made something in the back of her throat recall a childhood spent lying on the back step while her grandmother painted the kitchen, and then she saw it, and the memory buckled. The stone of the stile had been slopped with color with a nasty care, in bands as neat as a butcher’s apron. Someone had taken their time. Ellen made a note, the man next to Lyd took a photo. “Kids,” he said, not believing it. “Bloody kids, they do a TikTok and get their kicks. Last time it were cow-tipping.”

“Leave the judgments to later,” Lyd said, more sharply than she meant, because she needed her heart to stop trying to run. She went on, along the wall, stooping, and that was when she saw it, caught in a thorn: a button. A brown plastic nothing that could have fallen from any coat anywhere. But on the back of it, the manufacturer’s stamp and a little brace of thread like a vein, and a fleck of purplish paint that didn’t belong. She bagged it in the little zip bag someone had had the sense to give out at the hall.

By noon the moor had their sweat and their hope and kept their boys for itself. People went home because you can’t argue with Sunday dinner without feeling small. Lyd stayed longer than was sensible and then took the path down that cut under the railway viaduct. There was a culvert there, where water gossiped and rats lived scholarly lives and the concrete wore graffiti like tattoos. The viaduct threw a shadow like a great old thing at rest. She slowed, listening. It was quieter here, because even sound didn’t want to get caught underneath those arches. That was where she found the cat.

It was dead, but not long dead. More startling was the streak along its flank, a delicate smear of pale purple like someone had drawn their finger down the fur. It had been done with a brush you might use on pastry, careful, a little adoring. Lyd reached out and then put her hand firmly in her pocket instead. “No,” she said to herself. “Let someone in uniform touch it.” She walked away and then walked back and then made herself go home.

Up in the culvert, where the concrete had buckled over nothing and made a pocket of air and a pocket of dark, a creature watched her go. Its name was Jerry, because names mean different things depending on who gives them, and he had been given a few. He had picked one that tasted like something he could giggle at when he needed to laugh. He stood with his back against the cold, and took up the paper he had taken from a book he had found in a skip behind the college; it talked about pigments. You could grind dried petals, you could roast bones. You could heat stone in a pan and make it sweat its heart out. He had his ways. He liked the word lilac because it clung to the roof of his mouth like a sweet, and because humans said it as if it meant gentle. He painted the cat because he liked to practice before he would let himself be hungry. He had rules, he told himself, and when you have rules you are civilized.

He was a goblin, and in some stories goblins live all at once, in gangs in the thick woods, laughing and breaking and taking, but Jerry was a private sort, a neat sort, a sort that had learned to watch human faces until his own could pretend to lie like theirs. He hid, and he made plans, and he kept lists in his head. He was fueled by hate like other things are fueled by sugar or petrol. He believed there were clean things and unclean things and that he belonged to the clean because he had set his mind to it. Goblins were a rough breed, root-born and stubborn as coal, but he had decided he would be finer than that, he would be the one that made rules. He hated mixtures. He hated smudged lines. He hated faces that did not know their place on the little slope from better to worse. And he hated—without needing to say it out loud—the boys who walked with laughter as if the world had been tailored for them. In his head he organized the world into colors you should be and colors you should not, and every mistake he corrected with a brush.

He had mother once, or something that wore the shape of the word. She had spat, “Don’t look at them, Jerry. Don’t talk to those people.” She had meant some of the other things that lived under bridges and lived on milk stolen out of cats. He had watched a different kind of person and found that he could not do without watching.

He kept his brushes in a tin, rinsed until his filthy hands looked momentary clean. He had a small radio he’d salvaged that brought him voices and a version of weather. He whispered along when the talk turned to news and names. When it did not, he went out. He claimed edges. He painted them to make them his. In his mind, if he made the moor lilac, it was cleaner. It was his.

Lady Follybridge did not know him yet. She knew that her fence had a new smear, her stone a new stripe, and that when she peeled a flake of paint off the stile with a penknife it slid like skin under blade. She wiped her knife on the leg of her jeans and heard her grandmother’s ghost tell her that was no way to treat steel. “I’ll polish it later,” she said under her breath, and wasn’t entirely sure to whom she was promising.

Her phone buzzed. Nathan Rooke, who had been her friend since a school day when she had pushed a bully’s head into a trough and found herself in need of someone who did not mind sitting in the corridor with the punished. He worked as a paramedic now, which was just a way of moving the word helper onto a uniform, and he had a habit of finding out things he shouldn’t know. “You looked?”

“Looked and found nothing like enough,” she said. “Or found too much and it added up to nothing. You’re on shift?”

“On tea. Hazel says you’re on your way down to town. She says watch your bag.”

“Hazel says,” Lyd echoed, and smiled despite herself. “What do you know about lilac paint?”

“Enough to tell you that the lab says the smear on the underpass is a mix. Oil. A plant extract. Something that looks like chalk but isn’t, and bone in the flour. Someone with time and malice. Posh, careful malice. Why?”

“Someone’s marking. One of my sheep came up with a stripe this morning. Cat near the viaduct. Looked…lined up.”

“If this is some hogwash TikTok thing—”

“Do you think so?”

“No,” he admitted, and blew a breath that static made into a rush in her ear. “Don’t step under anything you can’t see the top of. Bring the knife you keep pretending is for twine.”

She laughed. “It is for twine.”

“Uh-huh. Wave it around once or twice so people think you’re dangerous.”

“People already think that,” she said, and hung up to the sound of his hoot.

The afternoon wore the dull expression Sunday afternoons wear in villages. Church bells, once. The sound of a quad bike somewhere on the other side of the hill, complaining. Lyd fixed the alternator on the tractor because sometimes you can make your mind go quiet by putting a hand to something stubborn and finding a way to make it remember its purpose. Alfred wandered and disappeared for a while and then returned with the sort of mushrooms the internet would warn you about. He set them down on the kitchen table and she looked at them like enemies. “For the photograph,” he said. “We can ask Hazel. She will have a chart.”

“Hazel is not a chart.” But she took a photograph because choosing to keep an old man who had taught you the names of the trees safe was a habit as much as love. He went out again just as the sky began to turn inward and the day thought about putting its coat on.

He did not get far; his knees were old and the moor took its rent in inches now. He stopped by the gate and looked down at the note tied there with baler twine. He had seen so many notes: bills, fliers, those little squares of paper neighbors leave that say cake so you forgive their gossip. This one had no many words at all. Just a line, written in a neat careful hand that did not belong in this century, and a smear of pale purple in the corner like someone had pressed a thumb to it to claim: Mine. The line read: Stop mixing.

Alfred frowned at it until his frown turned into a question he could not answer. He took it into the kitchen and set it under the sugar bowl because if it sat under sugar it could not be poison. When Lyd came in, smelling of oil and a day, he said, “You won’t like this.”

She didn’t. “Mixing what?” she said, as if saying it aloud would make sense happen.

“Whatever the fool thinks he’s keeping in rows,” Alfred said, but he said fool instead of devil and took a breath as if to taste what he had dared.

Lyd put the note in a plastic sleeve she had for lamb tags. “We should call Uddin.”

“We should eat first,” Alfred said. He said it as a joke, but the old man had a superstition that you do not invite the law until you have fed yourself, because once the law comes in they bring their own rules, and you may forget to swallow. They ate, and the cottage seemed to get smaller with each swallow, and the dark outside pressed its nose to the window like a curious thing.

When the phone call was done and the assurances made and the we’ll send someone in the morning placed carefully like a paperweight on a stack of unrest, Lyd stood and reached for her coat.

“No,” Alfred said, still in his chair. He knew her the way moor knows footfall. “You’re going to walk the hedge. You think he’s watching. He probably is. He’s not strong, not on the outside, a person like that hides behind paint and words and a pen. Don’t give him your back.”

“I’m going to the edge,” she said. “I won’t be gone long.”

“Take…” He groped around for an old word and found it, of all things, in his mother’s mouth. “Take salt,” he said, and laughed at himself. “I brought mushrooms and turn into a folk tale.”

She put a little twist of salt in her pocket anyway, because sometimes love is doing the old man a favor without making him see it. She took the twine knife, which was a knife for twine and also for other things if it came to it, and she took a torch even though she very much wanted to be a person who did not need one. She walked to the gate where the note had been and looked at the knot of baler twine and saw no new paint. She walked the hedge and found a smear there, and there, like a child had dragged sticky fingers along the leaves. She knelt, and her jeans took damp, and the paint flaked under her nail like something that would come alive if you watered it.

“Come out,” she said to the hedge, and surprised herself. “If you have something to say, say it with your mouth.”

Silence, shaped like a held breath. Then a rustle, half a joke, a movement two fields away. She stood, and the moor stood up with her, and she remembered being ten and feeling like the moor might teach her to read some day, if she asked sweetly. You didn’t ask sweetly now. You asked firmly and you waited. “I will find you,” she said, as if she were talking to a dog that had lost its name. “Whoever you are. You put paint on my stone, you left notes on my gate. You put terror into the necks of the mothers in this valley. I will find you.”

In the culvert, Jerry grinned and grinned until his cheeks hurt. He had seen her, had watched her walk, had catalogued the way she held her head like something that had once had a crown and had put it down and went back to milking. He liked her in the way a man might like a mountain he plans to carve his name on. He dipped his brush again and made another neat band on a slab of concrete. “We are going to do things properly,” he told the empty tunnel, the sibilance of the water agreeing with him. “No more smudges.”

Two days later, in the grey hour when even foxes look like second guesses and the mist does not decide whether it is staying, a boy named Ryley did not come home. His mother rang Hazel. Hazel rang Lady Follybridge and noted, not meaning to be unkind, that the Lady would be there sooner than the police. “He’s got a habit of taking the long way,” Hazel said, voice trying to be normal.

“And I have a habit of not giving up,” Lyd said.

She went. She stopped at the old bridge across the little stream that wanted to be a river when it was older, and she saw the paint on the arch, perfect bands like the throat of a pretty bird. She put her hand on the stone and felt the damp in its bones. She looked down into the water and saw a bloom of color caught in the weed, a pale cloud like a bruise had bled out carefully. She wanted to jump into the water with both boots on. She wanted to run home and lock the doors and windows and build the old rules back up around the house so that nothing itched. She did neither. She walked along the bank and found the place where the grass had been pressed down by knees. The paint was still tacky and it shone when the torch light hit it, which meant someone had been here in the not-long-ago. She held her breath. She listened, hard, to see if somewhere the air carried a note not its own.

“Stop mixing,” Jerry whispered, inches away through stone and damp, and smiled because whispering is another way of painting. He thought of the old man in tweed and the young woman with a knife for twine and he tasted the future like a sweet. He would have to be careful. The moor was full of eyes now, not even just the police; old women who had been girls in factories and men who had been boys in lanes, all of them with their heads up and their mouths thin. He liked it. What is the point of a hunt if the deer does not run?

Back at the house, Alfred took the note from under the sugar and held it up to the light. The paper looked cheap but the handwriting did not. He felt the way one does in an art gallery when a painting clicks and you do not know why. He thought of his mother’s blessing and the way she would not let him step over a broom if it lay across a doorway. He went to the mantel and took the old brass whistle down, the one his father had used in the war to line men up, because if you believe in talismans, then this could be one too. He put it in his pocket and went to the back door and looked out at the yard as if it might move in a way that would tell him what came next.

The day moved. The people did. Jerry moved, too, sliding through spaces people left in their lives, the way a rat can pass through a hole the size of your palm. He set things where he wanted them to be. He did a kindness for an old woman who had fallen on the steps, because it is polite to be kind before you are cruel, and because it teaches your hand not to shake. He watched for the boy with the R name, and he watched for the lady whose name tasted of bridges and the foolishness of building them in marsh. He bought a tin of something from a shop with a bell and stood at the door and let the bell ring and ring while he did not move, because sometimes you can see people’s insides by making them weigh whether to tell you to stop.

“We’re closing,” the shopkeeper said, and the voice was the voice of a person who has had to repeat themselves enough times to learn the flavour of their own patience.

He smiled, and left, and wrote STOP MIXING on the shop’s step with water, invisible, and watched it evaporate and pretended he had been powerful because he needed to be.

Lyd learned that a list can be a handhold. She wrote down all the places the paint had appeared. She drew lines between them that cut the moor into slices like cake. If this was pattern then it meant something and if it meant something then it could be stopped. She folded the map and unfolded it and shook it and laid it flat so that the folds didn’t insist on being valleys. “All right,” she told it. “Show me.”

The old man came up behind her and put his warm old hand on the back of her neck. “What are you doing, pet?”

“Trying to make sense from a person who will not give it,” she said. “Trying to stitch up a wound with wrong thread.”

“Then you’ll run out of thread and use wire,” Alfred said. “We are a people of stubborn.”

She smiled and let his hand be there long enough to work like a blessing. Outside, a magpie landed on the fence and shouted some nonsense and hopped and hopped as if it hurts not to dance. The day ahead hurried towards them. It would bring more paint. It would bring nothing. It would bring a boy, or a button, or a brush hair stuck in mortar like a message. It would bring, eventually, if that is how stories go, the breath of the man in the culvert smelling of bone dust and the old rulebook being put in somebody else’s fire.

And by the time the first real rain came, fat drops bruising the dust and taking dust for a walk down the lane, the lilac had seeped into the moor like a bruise that had decided on permanence. The sheep rubbed against it and caught it and shook their heads as if they could dislodge a dream. Lady Follybridge pulled her hood up and walked out into it like someone keeping an appointment. Jerry licked a finger, tried to taste the rain, and found it tasted of iron and a new understanding: the valley had decided. It had taken sides. The game he loved best had found somebody else who loved it enough to play to the end. He would have to change the rules to win. He tucked the brush behind his ear like a pencil and whispered to the stone, “Stop mixing.” The stone, if it heard him, did not reply. It had been mixed—sand, water, chalk—and it knew what you could make out of fuss and minerals and patience, which is to say almost everything.Chapter Two

Rain on the moor has its own handwriting. It scrawled across the bracken and wrote the old alphabet on the dry stone, fat looping letters that slicked the field paths and turned the sheep to smudges. Lyd woke to the mutter of it at the sash and listened long enough to know it meant to settle in, not pelt and pass, and there was comfort in that. The first brew tasted of roof tin and tannin, clean and dulling, and she took it to the door and watched the yard become a place made of circles—droplets in puddles, the rings of the old oak, the collar of the collie lifted when he lifted his head to sniff the weather. The kitchen had that first-rain smell, where everything old gives a little up and you remember every winter you cooked through while the lanes flooded and the lorries stayed on the A-roads. The note lay under a paperweight now, a little glass pig she had won three summers ago at the Holmebridge fête for guessing the weight of a ham, and it looked absurdly dainty over STOP MIXING. Alfred came in behind her tying his scarf even though he would be inside and made a face at the sky like bargaining. A day of rain was a day when the moor told people to mind their kitchens and their paperwork and not to tramp the peat, and Lyd took orders badly, but there was a Ryley missing and paint that crept, and water or no water would not keep her.

Hazel’s shop had weather of its own. The bell over the door never rang the same twice, because Hazel’s husband had rigged it with different bits of string that he replaced when he thought of it, and today it made a chime like a teaspoon tapped on a jar. The post office window had stamps of monarchs in three colors and a sign that said passport checks by appointment, and below that a hand-lettered bit of paper that said if you’re in a rush, you’re in the wrong village. Hazel herself had hennaed hair pinned up in a mess of hairpins that had probably been in that shop when her mother ran it, and her cardigan had moth holes that had become decorative by sheer insistence. She looked up from bagging screws for a man who had come in for one and would leave with three because Hazel didn’t like lonely things. “Lyd,” she said, as if that closed a paragraph.

“I’ve got your note,” Lyd said, holding it by the corner in its plastic sleeve. “He’s getting cheeky.”

“He is not a he,” Hazel said, and then shook her head and conceded to English. “It, they, a human with shins, call it what you like. Did you bring me the mushrooms or did you forget to trust me?”

“They’re on my phone where safety lives,” Lyd said, handing the device over. “And I’m not here about fungus, though if those are death caps I’ll boil Alfred in tea before I let him fry them.”

“They're horse mushrooms and perfectly respectable if given garlic and a pan that doesn’t sulk.” Hazel swiped through photographs with a confidence built on having swiped through other people’s lives for forty years. She stopped at Alfred’s careful hand with three pale caps and a thumb for scale and made a satisfied noise. “Not everything kills us, Lyd. Only what’s bored, and fungi are interested sorts.” Her mouth tightened, though, when Lyd pressed the plastic sleeve on the counter with one finger. “I’ve had two of those under my door since Saturday. One said KEEP TO YOUR SIDE. The other said WE SEE YOU. Both had the nasty little mauve thumbprint like a baby with a gentler mother had been let into paint.”

“Show me,” Lyd said, and Hazel plucked two envelopes from under the biscuit tins and held them up and then thought better and used tongs for pastry instead. The paper had that cheapness that tears in clean lines. The handwriting belonged to someone who had admired copperplate and taught themselves a cruel imitation. It had loops and a gravity to it. “I told PC Uddin,” Hazel said. “She told me to tell you not to go out alone. I told her the last person who told me not to go anywhere on my own ended up married and miserable. She smiled with her mouth and not her eyes. You know how she is.”

“She’s new enough to us that we keep trying to test her,” Lyd said, and felt a guilty heat for the village’s habit of folding people in tight and slow. “She’s better than we deserve and we’ll make use of that if we have to.” She glanced up at the CCTV camera Hazel’s nephew had insisted on installing after a spate of shoplifting that turned out to be bad memory and generous tabs. “You seen anyone that looks…how do I even say this without sounding mad…like he’s auditioning for a part in his own head?”

Hazel’s mouth did a small twist. “That man with the ears,” she said softly. “Came in yesterday late, when you could wring the air and get weather. Didn’t buy a thing, had that smile like he had a joke he wouldn’t share. Stood very close to the sugar. Why do the odd ones always hover by sugar? As if the body knows.”

“That’s a description I can boil down for a statement,” Lyd said dryly, but she felt a cold finger run down the nape of her neck. “Ears.”

“Like leaves you forgot to pick in time,” Hazel said, and her usual laughter sat this one out. “He did not smell right. I am an old woman who has worked a shop; you learn the difference between a lad who’s had a pint and a man who carries a smell like it’s part of his opinion. He smelled of something…used. Oil, like tractors. Bouquet in it, like one of those candles our Chloe buys that makes her flat smell of stuff that never grew near us. And chalk, but chalk that had been in a fire.” Hazel offered the tongs back like a benediction. “Fix it,” she added, and then shook her head at herself for saying it as if there were a lever people like Lyd could pull. “Or if you can’t fix it, then be the person who can stand to look at it long enough to find a person who can.”

Outside, the rain had shifted to that floating drizzle that never admits to being rain and gets into every stitch you own. Lyd ducked under the fly-posted board for the Holmebridge Players and the bit of gutter that took its social role seriously and hurried to the hall because it was a day to be among people. Ellen from the school had set up maps again, this time with acetate and old felt tips that bled. A group of teenagers who were having to learn what a village’s grief looks like without the buffer of distance stood around pretending not to wish to be elsewhere. PC Uddin had come in in waterproofs that looked like they had been ordered by someone who had never lived inside a cloud and her hair rode her head like a storm flag. “I need to ask,” she said when Lyd came up with damp shoulders, voice pitched low so the room did not take it on its tongue. “Alfred’s note—where did you find it exactly and what time? And has anything else arrived at Follybridge since?”

“Gate post. Late afternoon,” Lyd said. “And only the old superstition in my pocket.” She showed the little twist of paper and salt like you might show an inspector a set of knitting needles. “How much of this am I allowed to call what it is? Not for your paperwork. For my head.”

Uddin’s smile had teeth in it. “On record, we are pursuing multiple lines of inquiry. Off record, you can call it the thing you grew up calling it,” she said. “There’s a pattern to the marks, you knew that. I had our analyst in Wakefield look at the map and at an old set of parish bounds someone clever put online when the internet still had room for kindness. Your painter is hitting merestones, Lyd. Old ones. He’s lacing the places we used to walk and whack with sticks to tell the land where it ends. The lilac’s not random. It’s tidy. It’s almost respectful, if I can put a foul thing in a nice coat.”

Lyd put her finger on the map where Wessenden hooked like it kept a secret and traced the line down to the packhorse road. “Beating the bounds,” she said, remembering the brittle joy of it when she had been a child and a beadle with a stick had made them say prayers for hedges. “So that’s his lunatic sermon. Stop mixing. Stay in your field. Stay in your parish. Stay behind your old stone.” Her mouth went dry in that awful way that isn’t fear and isn’t thirst but something older. “He’s not only painting the moor. He’s painting people.”

“I’m telling people not to go out alone and the parish Facebook is telling me to go back to London,” Uddin said with the gallows humor of a person who has outlived others’ nonsense. “Ryley’s mother says he has a habit of not doing as he’s told because he doesn’t like anyone to think they own him. She said it proud and then she nearly bit her tongue off for fear of having made that a dare. We’ve got teams on the viaduct and the culvert and that horrible ginnel by the old builder’s yard where boys old enough for cigarettes go to make themselves into men and mostly end up with pneumonia.”

“Tell them to look for the paint and not only for footprints,” Lyd said. “He marks to warm his hands and/or because he’s got a ritual that calms his lunacy. If we see fresh lilac we’re close.”

Uddin nodded and then reached out as if to touch Lyd’s shoulder and stopped an inch shy, because lines were a thing even in a crisis. “And you,” she said. “You don’t go writing your own legend. You can be brave and not be daft. I’ll come by later and look at your wall.”

“I cleaned it,” Lyd said, and then felt all at once that she had scraped a signature off a public document. “I couldn’t stand the sight of it.”

“Then we’ll make do,” Uddin said. “We always do.”

You could measure a valley by how it talks when it’s scared. That afternoon, Lyd heard four variations before she had even made it to the yard. At the bakery a man with flour on his elbow took the hard line—“String the bugger up”—as if the village still had such rope and permission. At the school gate a cluster of mothers said mostly nothing because they were spending all their words inside their houses. Down by the rugby pitch a group of men pretended to talk about fixtures and said the word lad too often with their mouths gone small. Ruth the vicar stood under an umbrella that failed to keep anything truly dry and said to Lyd, “I have a cupboard full of candles if people need to leave them somewhere that isn’t a kitchen window. I don’t know where to let them put them. The church has rules about this that might once have been sense. I think we might borrow the rules and make new ones and ask forgiveness later.”

“Put them by the noticeboard,” Lyd said, picturing the welt of lilac under the bridge and wanting light where he had put color. “And put a bowl for coins and a note that says this will go to the mountain rescue or to the boy’s mother. It’s not rational. It will keep someone’s hands steady.”

Nathan caught her by the arm then, looking like he had not slept and would make a joke anyway. His paramedic greens were the sort of damp that never dries unless you back them up to a radiator and make them smell of dust. “We had a call midnight,” he said, workmanlike. “Old fella slipped on his back step because rain makes men think they’re still twenty. Nothing odd there. But on the step? Paint. Pale sodden purple. I took a swab because God keeps a jar of luck and sometimes he lets me steal from it. I told Uddin. She told me to tell you not to use me as your message board and that she’d buy me a kebab when this was done.”

“He’s dancing with us,” Lyd said softly, hating how true the image felt. “He knows where to touch so we see him and cannot hold him.”

“Then stop letting him lead,” Nathan said, and grinned a tired grin that had lines cut into it by grief calls and drunk lads and babies born in back seats. “Also, your Alfred told me to tell you that he put the mushrooms in the bin because you looked at them like they were witches.”

She would have laughed if the day had been made of any lighter cloth. She went home because the collie would need reminding that rules continued. Alfred had the kettle on because he believed the besieged should drink things hot and bitter. The whistle lay on the mantel where he had put it earlier and now it had company: a box of horseshoe nails, a twist of red thread, a little iron key that had opened nothing in living memory. He was building his kind of arsenal with the seriousness of a child packing a pocket for an expedition. “I was thinking,” he said while she took her boots off without taking her eyes off the rain. “About boundaries. Used to be if you wanted to keep the valley in its right mind you had a procession and you asked the children to beat the merestones with sticks so they’d remember where the world begins and ends. Some places, they’d bump the little ones on the stones so they’d remember with their bones. I used to think that was cruelty dressed in Sunday best. Now I think it was a way to say the land’s got a shape, remember it. This fool of ours—he’s decided he’s the beadle.”

“He’s decided he’s God,” Lyd said, and then immediately corrected herself, because God had never been so small. “He’s decided he’s the hand that draws the line where lines should be blurred by kindness.”

Alfred took the whistle down and weighed it in his palm. “I’ll walk with you,” he said without room for her to argue. “You’ll say don’t. I’ll say I’m not too old for a stroll. We’ll put on hats and we’ll go where you were going anyway. If you catch him you’ll need someone who’ll not pull you off him for fear. If he catches you I don’t intend to sit here with my tea getting cold and my stories falling out of my head.”

They went together when the light had that late gray that never quite becomes dusk in weather like this. The hedge wore beads. The road to the bridge had a fresh freckling of lilac, tiny glances at the base of posts, the kind of mark somebody makes when they can’t help themselves. Lyd put her hand into her pocket and touched the salt and told herself she did not believe and told herself she did and let the two beliefs hold hands. The stream was higher than yesterday and ran hurrying, as if a message had found it and it needed to deliver it to the Calder and from there to the sea and from there to somebody else’s business. At the arch, the paint had dripped in tidy tears. Lyd crouched and stayed there until her thighs told her to pick a time to decide and then decided to stand. Alfred put two fingers between his teeth, brought the whistle there instead because he remembered himself, and blew a note that made the rain listen.

From under the bridge came a small sound. It could have been a rat. It could have been water thinking. Lyd held her torch to the darkness where the old mortar wore suede. The beam took nothing at first and then picked out something that did not belong to bridge nor scrabbling animal—a jar with a lid, tucked into a neat cyst of stone. She reached out and then remembered Uddin’s mouth gone flat and waited. Alfred took the key from his pocket and tapped the jar like a person tapping a dormouse’s house. Nothing scuttered. Lyd used the knife for twine and teased it out of its niche. The glass was smeared with that careful mauve like a lover’s fingerprints. Inside, a spill of old paper cuttings, a lock of hair tied with red thread, a button that may have once closed something a boy had worn. She felt her stomach drop as if under a hill she had not seen coming. “We put him in church,” she said, not sure whether she meant the boy or the jar. “We have a word for that and it is wrong.”

“Witch bottle,” Alfred said, and shook his head as if telling the centuries off. “Except this is a goblin’s bottle and his prayers are on the wrong side of the coin. Put it back the way we found it. Tell the copper. Don’t give him the joy of stirring it.”

They placed the jar back with the precision of thieves in reverse. The rain spooled. On the far bank a shape shifted, and Lyd’s skin went cold. A figure unbent itself from a crouch too smooth for a person with the usual arrangement of bones, and a head turned like an owl’s turns to take an opinion. He could have been anybody, he could have been something else, he was both, he was the kind of thing you see and later tell yourself you did not, because the brain is a generous liar. “Evening,” the voice said, and it was the voice from the stile, the underpass, the stone. It was unctuous and patient and pleased with itself. “Lovely weather for a blessing.”

Alfred’s hand fell to the whistle and found the hollow and made the body remember breath. Lyd lifted her torch so the beam hit just wrong and did not give him the clean outline he might want. “You’re trespassing,” she said, and felt the old word settle cleanly between her teeth. “This is my water. My bridge. My dead.”

“Nothing is yours,” the shadow said, but there was a wobble at the word dead that made Lyd file it away and show it to Uddin later. “That’s the point, Lady. Everything needs a fence. I’m doing God’s work since you threw Him out with your college certificates. Stop mixing. It’s dirties all of you. Look at you.” He laughed a little on the last word. “Look at you. Mud on your cuffs and town in your voice. Pick a side and stand still.”

“I picked,” Lyd said calmly, though she could feel her blood make itself into a small river for her heart to cross. “And it wasn’t yours. Come and say that nearer if you’ve got the courage to back it.”

There are a hundred ways a person can move to tell you who they are. The thing under the arch did not move like any she would name a person. It slid, the way eels do, the way a second does when you spill it. It took a step that had too many parts in it and then thought better because whatever else Jerry was, he had read enough human lines to know that sometimes it is the not-coming that wins. “You’re going to make me work,” he said, and it was almost…delighted. “I do like a challenge. You didn’t answer my question, by the way. What color are you when you peel all that off? It’s important to know. Tells me where to put you.”

“In front of a judge,” Lyd said. “Or under a stone.”

He laughed without mirth and the bridge threw it back with a twang. “We’ll play catch,” he said, and then his outline scattered, not disappeared—there is a difference. There was the certainty of him taking himself back into a seam of the world where you could not reach because your hands are made of the wrong material. Lyd stood very still and then very slowly let her shoulders down, because animals teach you that the last thing you show an adversary is the cost. Alfred blew the whistle again, just once, and it sounded like an old rule refusing to lie down.

On the way back up the lane, past the hawthorn that had been there since a woman had married a man who did not deserve a pie, they met Ruth the vicar and three teenagers carrying umbrellas that made them look like hopeful mushrooms. Ruth took one look at their faces and knew something had graduated, small and awful. “We put the candles by the board,” she said, as if telling them of light might keep it. “Someone left a tin of boiled sweets. It seemed right. If you saw him, Lady Follybridge, I’ve a prayer for fools that I can say and pretend it’s for him. If you didn’t, I’ll say it for us.”

“Say it anyway,” Lyd said. “Say it for the mothers.”

That night had a thickness to it that did not let sound go very far. The house drew in, and even the old clock on the mantle ticked like it had been muffled in a pocket. Lyd cleaned the knife because if you were going to lie about what it was for you might as well give it the respect of your lie, and she wiped the grit from the torch with kitchen roll that Alfredo called a sin against rags. She laid out a second set of wet clothes to steam by the Rayburn and the smell rose like a memory of a hundred other storms. Uddin came, later than she’d said, soaked and unflappable, and they took the jar down together and put it in a bag with Uddin’s name on it and the little black marker that made things part of a case. “He thinks he’s the line keeper,” Uddin said when she’d written and photographed and done three careful circles with her shoulders to shake off the cold. “We’ll give him a line. We’ll pull it round him.”

Jerry stayed awake until dawn because he did his best thinking when the sky had not yet decided. He had a book of boundary stones he had borrowed without intent to return and he licked his finger to turn the pages and left a faint polish of lilac on the pictures. He thought of the whistle and of the woman with the light in her hand and of the old man who had not trembled. He thought of boys who smelled of beer and soap and their mothers’ anxieties on their cuffs and he felt the old hunger stir. Hunger is honest. He had starved it for days because there was so much to arrange and the arranging could feed you if you had taught yourself to get fat on control, but even a goblin has to bite something that bleeds eventually. He set down the book and picked up his brush like a man might pick up a cutlery knife he had promised not to use for anything but butter. “Stop mixing,” he told the tunnel, and this time the tunnel spoke back like he had taught it often enough to echo. He went out into the rain with a hood that hid most of what would give him away and moved along the edge of everything like he had been born on a line and resented it.

Morning came thin and then decided to be generous. The moor put back on its moor face. People got up and put their lives on like coats they knew were missing buttons. Lyd fed the cows and felt their breath on her cheek and thought of hunger that was not wicked and thanked the bodies that wanted nothing but food and warmth. Alfred read the bit of the paper with cricket and then without asking read the death notices because he liked to keep the village inside his head where it felt safe. The collie came to the door and laid his nose on Lyd’s knee like an old prayer. Nathan rang to say he’d left a thing at the end of the lane and when she went she found a thermos and a note that said in his once-detention hand you can pour this on a wound or a soul, i recommend option b. Hazel sent a text that was just a photo of a tray of pasties like small moons. Uddin’s message said: three more marks on the old packhorse way, all fresh, heading towards Intake. Also: we found a jumper. Not definitive. Not Ryley’s, says his mum. She knew to add that last like a kindness with edges.

Lyd washed her hands, took the salt, took the knife, and stood a moment with her hand on the old oak’s bark. She put her forehead to it and stole a little steadiness and thought, if you used to beat bounds for the children to remember, then perhaps you did it so that in a year when something with sharp teeth appeared, you did not have to teach them from the start where the edges were. She stepped away. She had things to do. The moor kept its own calendar and no appointment book of hers had ever been strong enough to argue, but today she meant to add one line of her own. She would go where the paint went, and she would not run when the voice called, and she would ask not what color he thought she was but what color he thought he was when he left off being only brave when people were looking the other way. She put her coat on and took the thermos and passed the whistle to Alfred, and the house watched them go with the air of a place that could keep every secret except the important ones.Chapter Four

Market day in Holmfirth pulled the valley tight like a laced boot even when the clouds hung low, and even when the rope between stalls sagged with rain, there were apples that remembered September and cheese that remembered grasses from fields no one had yet gridded with polite lines. Lyd went because bodies need bread and because the rhythm of coins changing hands had steadied women like her grandmother longer than she liked to think. She kept her coat up and her mouth down, took her eggs in a cardboard cradle and her bacon wrapped in paper that bled a little grease onto her palm, and let the noise of barter and gossip wash over the grit in her head. Jerry could not own market day, she told herself, and he could not take away the loudness of humans buying and telling one another their children’s bad habits as if that made the world sit up and mind itself. Hazel had a table tucked under the awning with two stacks of knitted hats and a box of those little torches that live brief and valiant lives. “If you won’t take a hat I shall bill you anyway,” she said, handing over a moss-green thing that looked like it could turn back sleet. “And there’s talk of doing a walk. Not the silly kind with people in glow sticks, the kind with sense. Ruth says a liturgy never hurt a fence.”

Lyd looked up and saw Ruth a few stalls over giving a leaflet to a man who was trying to pretend he could not read because pride is a bigger coat than need. The vicar’s umbrella dripped in a line, a metronome keeping time for a different set of rules. “If we beat the bounds,” Lyd said, tasting the old phrase and finding it didn’t sit wrong, “we do it to say there is no us without them, and the hedges want children leaning on them. We don’t do it to tell anyone to stay in their corner.”

Hazel nodded, counting change with the speed born of a long love affair with coins. “I told her to write two versions. One for God and one for people who need fewer Latin words to tell them to hold hands. And we’ll set the date on the board so the valley knows where to be when they want to be themselves. You’ll come and bring your whistle-bearing great statue of a man. He’ll teach the children how to walk in a line without thinking they’ve joined the army.”

He had the whistle in his pocket now as if it had found its own way there, and Alfred stood by the cheese man discussing rinds with the seriousness that other people apply to war. He caught Lyd’s eye and lifted his bag without triumph as if victory was bread and you didn’t shout about it in the street. She paid for the hat because the weather was not planning to relent, and paused by the woman with the honey and the stall with the dog biscuits because every brown-eyed customer in the village had stopped there and wagged a tail. She let herself be part of the ordinary, long enough for the hunger for it to stop being a sharp thing and settle into its usual ache.

PC Uddin found her by the fish van in a little riot of ice and silver. “He touched my car,” she said without hello, and when Lyd’s mouth did something that was not unkind but plain, Uddin tipped her chin towards the short parade of shops where the police vehicle sulked under the awning with a neat purple stripe on its bumper. “Two inches wide. Measured it with my warrant card for spite. He stood under my camera and painted on public property with neatness I wish I could find in my own kitchen. I’ll let the lab tell me what I already know. It’s his mix.”

“He’s making sure we all carry his colour so if we catch him we do it as part of his story,” Lyd said, feeling her shoulders want to pick up the old habit of holding. “Don’t give him your speech. Give him a fine that makes him think bureaucracy is a demon with good shoes.”

“That’s tomorrow,” Uddin said, half-smiling without humour. “Today I’ve a team out at Intake, and a call from a farmer past Holme that his calves were marked like marching bands. And a message from Wakefield that says the bones in that paint are pig and sheep and pigeon, not human, and that we can all sleep better with that in our heads even if our hearts won’t buy it. Nathan says he can spare an hour after his next call. He has a rope he says is clean enough for the inside of a drain.”

“You make it sound like you’re going to let me put my body into a place that wants to make it a fact,” Lyd said, and didn’t bother to make it an invitation. “If we go under that old vent at Scout where the kids dare each other, we’ll find a pocket. If we find a pocket we’ll find neatness, maybe jars. Maybe the edge of him.”

“We go,” Uddin said, and the word was a nail in a plank. “With heads, with someone above ground, with common sense, with the knowledge that ladders aren’t only for getting out of trees where you stuck a kite.”

The vent at Scout sat in a fold of ground that had once been industry and had the memory of metal. The grass round it had an acid green the moor did not countenance, and the concrete lip had graffiti in two layers, one that said names and hearts in bubble writing and one that had been painted later in tidy bars of lilac that made the names look like they wore pretty handcuffs. Nathan met them with rope and a face not long on sleep and high on stubbornness, and a friend from mountain rescue with a soft voice and arms that understood knots. “We said we were not doing this,” Nathan said conversationally as he coiled and uncoiled because hands keep their own anxieties calm. “And then we remembered we were all born with a condition called Not Learning. So. Rope on the dead man’s, you on the line, me on the blether. If I tell you to stop, you stop. If you tell me to stop, I tell you to stop louder. Uddin, you’re on the radio with the person in the van who will call my boss if I decide to be more useful than allowed.”

“Blether?” Uddin said, eyebrows up. “That’s the technical term, is it?”

“It’s the one that gets me smiles when I need them,” Nathan said, and tied Lyd into the harness like a man who had done it for people having worse days than this. “You fall, I say language we don’t teach the cadets, we all go home and you buy me dinner in three years when we stop shaking.”

The world under the lip ate noise. Lyd lowered herself into it with a private prayer to the oak and the Rayburn and to whoever else minded people who did daft things for good reasons. The smell was everything that had ever lived in damp and been forgotten, and laced through it, clean and wrong, the sweetness of lilac that made her tongue feel skinned. The torch made a wedge in the dark and found rivulets of ancient run-off and the scurry lines of things that prefer to live where we won’t go. The shaft widened in and down, a stone throat with soot on it from a century ago when fires were coin and no one thought that air remembered. Her boots found a lip and then a place where someone had kept coming back and a hole had become a path. She felt the rope move against her back when Nathan fed it and heard his voice strung down after her, saying nonsense about the last time he ate soup too fast and burnt the roof of his mouth. It was half for her, half for him, and she loved him hard in that moment for being a practical man with jokes.

At the bottom—or the shape the bottom chose today—she found the tidy. He had made a room where there should have been only neglect, and the neatness made her teeth ache. A pallet with a blanket folded right, a tin box with brushes in a row, a shelf made from an old road sign that said Give Way and he had made it into his own altar. More jars. Bundles of plant stems tied with thread. Chalk in a wrapped cloth. A page from a book about limestone cut with a knife and annotated with a hand she recognised from her gate, the little smug loop at the end of g’s. She did not touch because Uddin’s voice was in her ear even though the policewoman was above ground, and because the old superstitions like to hover where you cannot put your science. She let the torch rest on the shelf so it made a pool and looked for any shape, any hint of boy. There was a locker with a door rescued from a school and she did not like that one bit. She put a hand to it and it opened without a noise, because he oiled the hinges of his badness. Inside, no body. A coat. A hoodie. Ryley’s? She could not be certain and hated her hands for wanting to crush cloth to make it confess. A smell of soap with someone’s mother in it. A hair caught on a splinter. She thought of the jar under the bridge with its button and she shut her mouth hard around a broken word.

She climbed back out with the rope making decisions; when her head cleared the lip, she wanted the sky the way a thirsty thing wants buckets. Nathan had his tired grin back on like armour and did not ask what she had seen, only took the coiled rope back from the shaft with the ceremony of a fisherman thanking a net. Uddin listened while Lyd unfolded two clean sentences and a third dirty with grief, and then asked her to say them again for the radio because the world needed it. “We’ll swab,” she said. “We’ll bag. We keep speaking out loud in case what’s listening thinks we’ve stopped believing in consequences.”

Later, Lyd stood in her yard and scrubbed her boots because there is a rite in washing from the inside of the earth. The collie wanted to nose the mud and she told him no and he took the order like a gift. Alfred came out and held a towel like a butler and said nothing until she nodded and then he said many small things about the shape of the clouds and the way the privet had got above itself, and it was their way of placing her back in the day so that the night would not find her before she’d made tea.

News travelled the way news does that is a mix of fact and wish. The teenagers who had pretended not to be part of it posted on their group chat about a room under the ground and a hoodie that might be a boy’s and a rumour of a name carved into stone that no one would place until it was too late. Ruth called to say the candles by the board had a quietness to them she could not name and that she had written her two liturgies and would Lyd please read them and tell her which one stung less. Hazel rang to report that a strange man had stood by the greedy jar in the charity shop and put coins in one at a time with a smile you wanted to sand flat, and that she had watched him until he did the dignified thing and left. “Ears again,” she said. “Some people look like they were carved and lost bits. This one looks like he was made from good ingredients and then baked with the oven door open.”

That evening, when the rain had decided to leave and let the cold shoulder the work, Alfred tucked his scarf up around his mouth and said he had an errand because old men with old friends do not wait until morning when a thought nags. Lyd made a noise that had in it both approval and the knowledge that telling him no would be like instructing the wind. He went slow and kept to the pavement where he could, and the moon took a cold interest in his progress. Edie lived in a house that had failed to decide what century suited it and had made a collage. She greeted Alfred with a mug and the sort of embrace people reserve for boys they once minded through measles. “You’ve a goblin,” she said without ceremony, because Edie had taught children for forty years and believed naming things took away their worst powers. “And not the laughing kind that steals hats. The kind that gets good at penmanship and thinks that makes him a god.”

“You’ll have a book,” Alfred said, grateful for decisions. “You always did.”

She had three, actually, and a tin box with the label chalked once and renewed a dozen times, and she put them on the table as if laying out a spell and perhaps that was what it was. The books were the sort that do not travel far from a county; collections of say-so and warnings and recipes that used to be called charms when charm meant something you did with your hands and not your eyes. The tin had iron nails, and dried rosemary, and an old lump of salt that had sweated into a shape like a potato. “You don’t beat them with a stick,” she said when Alfred’s face did something with disdain that would have made him trouble in staff meetings. “You set them a different dance floor. Goblins are picky eaters. They don’t like bread that’s made of three flours. They hate their own names spoken back at them. They can’t cross water that remembers salt. They hate iron if it’s been kissed by a person who meant it. They hate red thread because it reminds them of surgeons. They can be made to answer a decent question if you put a coin on your tongue and keep your temper. I don’t know if any of this is true in this century. The trick is to act as if it is, and they come round to believing with you.”

“Do you have a name?” Alfred asked, gentle and bald. “Not the one he gives when he wants to laugh at himself. The one his mother spat.”

Edie considered a long time and then made the noise that means I do but it will cost. “There was a Jerry under South Head a long time. He liked sheep and paint and promising girls to bring them rings that we would never see. He fell into a hole with his own rules and someone put a stone over it and we called that a solution for forty years. They don’t die in the way we do. They sour, or they harden. You can chip them. It makes dust; don’t breathe it.” She pushed the tin across the table. “Take a bit of this and do not call it magic when you put it in your pocket. Call it old housekeeping.”

Alfred took the red thread because it had the look of a story, and the nails because iron is honest, and a pinch of the salt because Edie’s hand had blessed it whether she would say so or not. He walked home with a memory of mischief riding ahead of him, and for a moment he felt his knees belong to him the way they had when he’d run from his own foolishness. Halfway down the lane, a shadow unhooked itself from a hedge and smiled as if they were at a garden party and had found one another across a table laden with bad sandwiches. “Grandad,” Jerry said with a softness that made Alfred want to spit. “You’ve got the look of someone who’s found a manual. Bring it to me, I’ll annotate.”

“Go teach your tongue to be quiet,” Alfred said, and kept walking because age gives you the right not to duel. “I’m too old to give my breath to the likes of you.”

“Stop mixing,” Jerry said, as if repeating it could make it a drum everyone’s feet fell in with. “You’re doing your part wrong. You’re supposed to go inside and point at the television and shout at it, and I’m supposed to do my work. We each have our roles. Stay in your lane.”

Alfred stopped because some insults deserve eye contact. “My role is to outlast your rules,” he said. “I outlast trends and bad milk and governments. I’ll outlast you. You’ll get bored and change your tune. I won’t. That’s the problem with true north, son. It keeps itself.”

Jerry laughed and because he had read the book on people he did not bare his teeth like the animal he was. He made his mouth do the curved line that suggests someone has charmed him and does not have to work for their place. He stepped onto the road and the moon made a ribbon on the damp that did not cling to his boots the way it did to Alfred’s. “Let me ask you a polite question,” he said, and that word polite made something in Alfred’s belly knot. “Your granddaughter. What’s she made of? You all say she’s the Lady like it’s a joke you share and don’t want anyone else to hear. Is she mud? Is she a landlord? Is she town? Is she valley? This is important, to know what you are, so you can tell the rest to stay off you.”

“She’s made of the same as the rest of us,” Alfred said. “Bone and spite and borrowed ground. If you think you can weigh her you’ve picked the wrong set of scales.”

Jerry inclined his head as if at a sermon he intended to write a letter about. “We’ll see,” he said. “Take care on that corner. The ditch is generous this time of year.” He stepped back into the hedge and it swallowed him, because some plants remember when they were forests and keep their habits. Alfred swore under his breath in language his mother would have claimed not to know, and walked home with the old box in his pocket and the urge to nail red thread across every threshold in the parish.

The date for the walk went up on the board, and a pattern made of people began to assemble in the air. Ruth wrote in both versions, choosing common sense over correctness and keeping God where He did His best work, which was in the space between people’s hands. Ellen stood by the maps and drew lines that were old lines and then drew new ones over them in pencil and said, this is where we go if we want to be seen and this is where we do not if we want to keep our ankles. Hazel bought twenty-four whistles in an impulse that felt like an order and then took another twelve because you cannot know how loud you’ll need to be until you have been too quiet once. Uddin put two extra people on this side of the moor and one on the old ginny where the goblin liked to have his little parade, because cops on foot make some things shrink. Nathan wrote a list that had on it: rope, chocolate, plasters, spare sense, and then corrected it so that sense came first. The teenagers who had pretended to want only to leave the valley put on jumpers and turned up at the hall and tried not to look like they had been thinking about candles by their bed.

Jerry did what people do who crave an audience. He made leading marks like breadcrumbs and lined them up like a man learning to waltz. He painted a band on an old boundary stone and then a shorter band on a gatepost and then a tiny one on the nail of a stile, and he watched to see if the humans would bend their days to his path. He thought about the boy Ryley and how careful he would have to be to keep this one alive long enough to refine him and he told himself this was mercy. He found Uddin’s car and polished the lilac stripe until it shone and then trailed his finger on the bonnet to draw a letter only he could see. He crept into the church porch and left a white feather there, not because he believed in it but because humans did, and that made it a mirror. Above all, he kept to his devotion: clean lines, no smudges. He made a mark outside the charity shop and stood in the rain until Hazel looked at him through the glass and did not blink, and this delighted him beyond measure in the way that only opposition can amuse a despot.

The walk set off under a sky that had done its best to be clear and then chosen honesty instead. People held sticks because someone always has half a dozen spare, and hands found elbows like old routes do. Ruth wore boots that meant business and carried both of her liturgies, one in each pocket, because indecision is a kind of faith. Lyd had the hat Hazel had thrust at her and the knife for twine and the little twist of salt and the knowledge that this might be foolish and that foolishness sometimes cuts a clean path. Alfred had the whistle and the thread and a pocketful of nails and a mouth that was not going to say the wrong thing first. Uddin divided them into rows like dancers, and there it was: the old beating of the bounds made new by a valley that had learned grief and would not stop its own singing.

They went clever. They did not step where the moor would punish them. They tapped stones, and where someone had marked the line with lilac bands they put the tiniest of their own marks on the grass with salt dissolved and dripped, a sign you would not see unless you had grown up with Aunties who told you to throw a pinch over your shoulder. Ruth said her words when they came to water and her words when they came to thorns and her words when they came to the places girls had been kissed and then forgotten, and people let the language sit in them without needing to agree on the shape of the listener. Children were told the names of birds and whether this old bridge had ever had a troll under it and whether trolls were allowed in stories anymore, and the kids found the line between mockery and seriousness and walked it like a beam. When they came to the old merestone above Intake with the cock and ball lightly carved by a mason who could not help himself, there was a neat new bar of lilac on it and a posy tied with red thread that had no business being that particular shade. Lyd looked at the thread and it looked back, familiar, and her stomach went quick and cold. Edie’s tin did not walk here by itself. This was mockery and theft and an attempt at shame.

“Not yours,” Alfred said quietly, and took the posy down and said thank you to the stone for being steady for two centuries. He did not untie the ribbon because you do not undo the knot in a thing that is half curse until you are somewhere you own the floor. He put the posy in his pocket without the ribbon and the ribbon he wrapped around his wrist because sometimes you say I see you in a way the enemy would not read right. Ruth said, “We bless with a better hand,” and tapped the stone and spoke the plainer words about paths and cows and getting home again.

Jerry watched from a gorse that wore old yellow like a memory. He did not expect them to do all this. He had wanted small panic and bigger gossip, not this organisation that felt like the moor itself had hauled its old bones to a sit and told the children the rules of the house. He felt something curious and chemical in his middle, a mix of frustration and admiration, and he scolded himself for the second because if you admire the thing you’re breaking, you will leave it a corner of itself. He moved along the edge like a shadow looking for a wall, and twice he set a new line of lilac where he thought they’d see it and twice a hand went out and salted it, and the little sizzle that made in his head made him bare his teeth where they could not see.

On the last stretch before the packhorse bridge, the ground dipped into mean grass that hides water. Uddin saw it first and put her whistle to her lips and wrote sharp on the air, and the line checked like a horse going to its knees to accommodate a rider who did not want to fall. Across the dip, a piece of ribbon stood up like a red tongue; a marker someone had put to say this way. It had lilac dabbed on its end like a signature. The trap of it made Nathan swear into his collar. “He’s herding,” he said under his breath to Lyd, and she nodded, thinking of sheep and dogs and the kindness of fences and the cruelty of pens.

“Round,” she called, using the field word because bodies understand it, and the line took a gentler curve and the trick failed with a sort of noise that is not a noise but a change in the air at a disappointed mind. They gained the bridge like it was the last square on a game board. The candles by the noticeboard stood in their glass jam jars with a daft dignity even in daylight and someone had stuck a feather in the crevice where once there had been a notice about a lost cat. Ruth took it out and put it in her pocket and didn’t make a face, because sometimes clergy do their best work after the crowd’s gone home.

They were beginning to believe in themselves, which is either the start of sense or the start of trouble. Then a sound came from under the bridge that made the room that is a human chest feel too small. It could have been a water slap. It could have been a rat making its way across a shelf of stone to where the spiders made lace. It could have been a boy. It had the shape of a syllable in it: a small, thin oh, or ah, or the name of a God not yet specified. People caught breath at different places in their bodies. Uddin held her hand up and the line held with it, clever beast. Nathan crouched without asking for permission and put his face to the arch and made his voice into something you might take down from a high shelf. “Hello,” he said, and the old habit in his vowels soothed the way a kettle does. “We aren’t going anywhere. Say that again so I can find it.”

The sound came again and this time it was letters, not noise. It said help, and under it a flavour of something else, like someone in the room got the telephone line on their teeth. A different sound braided itself through the boy’s sound and Lyd’s spine did its own arithmetic. “He’s there,” she said, and she was already down the bank without asking the moor to cosign. Uddin hissed a command that had directives and care in equal parts, and two people were on their bellies with her in the slick, Hazel’s husband one of them, surprising no one. Under the arch, in the void between the stones and the water like a priest hole, there was a gap that would take an arm and then a shoulder and then a life if you gave it. The voice was inside it, and around it, and braided through it a second voice chuckled low and neat, a laugh practiced in silence until it sounded like stone.

“Stop mixing,” Jerry whispered from somewhere that was not a place bodies can occupy. “Bring me just the bits of you that were on the right side of the wall.”

“Shut your mouth,” Hazel’s husband said, and then remembered the presence of his own wife and went red as a fresh-cut beetroot, and Lyd loved him for having chosen words over fear. “Ryley,” she called, no nonsense on it. “Tell me your name so I can pull you through. Tell me it and I’ll put it on the rope so the knot knows which way to go.”

“Ryley,” the voice said, and you could hear that a child had said it a thousand times and had never thought he’d have to sign it out, a second at a time, under rock. The sound came thin again, like air through a reed. “He says…” There was water in the voice and something else as if the boy had been given script. “He says I don’t belong. He says I should pick. He says if I pick he’ll let me stand on a stone. He says—”

“He says nothing worth the time,” Lyd said, and then she did the thing that she knew she would do and had been hoping she could hand to someone else. She put the blade under her tongue, the tiniest part of it, a taste of steel that snapped the world into sharpness, and put the little coin Edie had given Alfred into her mouth beside it because tricks do not care whose lips they kiss. “Ryley,” she said again, mouth full of iron and money. “Tell me the thing that is truer than him. Tell me what you are made of that cannot be sorted.”

“Bits,” the boy said, almost laughing and then not, and his voice warmed like someone put him by a fire. “Football and chips and my mum shouting and my nan kissing my head and Lil saying she’ll kill me if I don’t bring her bag back and Sufyaan’s hoodie that he said I nicked and the smell of my bedroom after training and Mr Patel saying I could pass if I did not act the fool and the colour of the big wood in summer and the taste of my own mouth when I run and—”

“That’s enough,” Jerry said, with a fury he had kept behind a fence, because the answer to his question had been wrong in the most lovely way. “Stop. Chew on the right parts. Discard the wrong. You people are so messy.”

“Keep it up, lad,” Nathan murmured, because he knew how to coach a person through bad air. “Talk yourself your shape.”

The gap under the arch widened because water does what it pleases if it thinks you’re not watching. They would have to drag the boy a way and then down and then up again, which is a geometry some bodies will not give. Uddin had the radio open and spoke a string of tidy phrases into it that began with assistance and ended with location, and the sound of the helicopter was far enough away to be useless and close enough to make them feel responsible. Alfred held the whistle and did not blow it because this was no time for alarm. He looked instead at the ribbon around his wrist and thought of Edie saying name it and bind it. He put the thread between his teeth and tore a piece with a strength his dentist would scold, and tied it to the old bridge stone. He said, in his own head and in words the air could share, “Jeremiah,” because names have long forms for a reason. The wind that didn’t yet exist at the river’s surface moved an inch. The chuckle under the tone changed its note like the wrong person had walked into a rehearsal.

The first reach failed because the angle insisted on physics. The second took skin and gave back a curse and a laugh that wasn’t Jerry’s. The third caught cloth and this time instead of tightening, Lyd pushed, because a man who taught her to free a stuck ewe had told her once that sometimes you get the thing out by going in and making it unhappily aware of itself, that it relaxes if shoved. Nathan braced his boots and gripped the back of her belt because when people do brave they always need someone at the loop where their trousers say they’ll fall. There was a noise then like something deciding to be possible. The boy came forward in increments that matched the beat of a heart that could not believe it got to keep beating. There was skin, and then shoulder, and then a face that would have been handsome if it had not learned fear today, and then they had him, and everyone got wet, and nobody told the water it had done wrong because water will choose to sulk.

Ryley lay on his back and his chest did its tricks that make paramedics look like magicians. He looked up at the old bridge and the people with rain on their faces and said, not all at once but enough, “He asked me. He asked me what colour. I told him. I told him I’m all of them and he called that dirty. He’s wrong.”

“He’s very wrong,” Ruth said, and she did not bless him because he did not need that and the boy would have sniffed at it. She put her hand on his forehead instead like a nanna measuring a fever and said, “You’re home enough.”

The small jubilance that comes after peril stood on its tiptoes, ready to turn into relief if given half a chance. It did not get its chance. On the door of Follybridge Cottage, when Lyd and Alfred got back from the ferrying that takes a person from near to nearer, a mark waited. It was careful, it had been made with a thin brush and a set of lungs that thought patience was a virtue. It curled and it had leaves, and it had flowers, and it had words in stem form twined through their own calligraphy, and it was in lilac so pale you might have thought it was lavender if you had not seen it thick. It said: CHOOSE YOUR DITCH. Alfred’s hand went to the iron key on the mantel without thought and knocked it twice against the wood, and Lyd felt the old rage come up from the animal part of her that had learnt a thousand years ago to guard the door where the cooking goes on. She took the knife for twine and carefully, with a steadiness that felt like love in reverse, she levered the mark from the wood the way you take a tick from a dog, making sure the head came with it. The paint lifted in a thin film that came away with a whisper. She put it in a jar because sometimes you put the enemy on a shelf and you make it small by making it contained.

That night the valley slept badly. Ryley's mother slept in sections that were only almost sleep and woke with her hand looking for someone’s shoulder and finding shirt fabric. Nathan slept like a man who has wrestled and won a round. Uddin did not sleep because reports do not write themselves and also because if she kept still her brain would play the sound of a boy’s breath in a culvert. Hazel watched her CCTV on a loop and went to bed when she should have been putting milk bottles in the crate. Ruth sat by the plug where the water comes in and had a conversation with God that neither of them will admit was a row. Jerry lay on his back on his pallet and counted the cracks he had left in the ceiling of his hide and made a little game of joining them up into the shape of a cage. He told himself a loss isn’t a loss if it improves the game, and that the woman at the bridge had improved it by being what she had always been: a thing that would not sit. He whispered Stop mixing to the dark and the dark did not care, which taught him a small lesson about where to place his whispers next. He closed his eyes and saw a hand with red thread on the wrist and said Jeremiah in his head the way you shake your own bones to see if they are sound, and swore not to laugh the next time a man older than him dared to make a rule.

Morning had the gall to be pretty, which is a kind of cruelty we live with. Lyd put the jar with the paint curl on the sideboard and wondered what shelf in Uddin’s evidence room would be its neighbour. Alfred tied the red thread around the leg of the kitchen table and said nothing about why because superstition doesn’t like being looked at directly. The collie woke from a dog dream that had had rabbits in it and shook himself with the conviction of a priest. The Rayburn breathed. Somewhere on the edge of the land, a creature picked up his brush and walked to the next stone in his private calendar. The valley had decided, and the decision had teeth. The mixing would continue, as it always had in kitchens and fields and at the river mouth where the Calder told the other waters its gossip. The lines would be walked, and beaten if they had to be, and salted if necessary, and in the end, when the first hawthorn blossom made meringue at the hedges, someone would take a shovel to the place under the culvert, and someone would lift a stone they had no business lifting, and the glass jar would remember what it had held and confess, and the words Stop mixing would look as foolish as they always were. For now there was breakfast to set on, and a whistle to polish, and a hat to hang. For now there were new rules to write in a hand that had loops and gravity, and they would be kinder rules, which are the only ones that survive.Chapter Six

Fog spent itself like an old coin on the moor and bought not distance but quiet, the good kind that sits with you in the kitchen and does not need to be told a story to stay. Lyd woke with the feeling in her mouth that she had been saying no in her sleep and found her tongue tasted of iron in sympathy with last night’s tricks, and under that, tea. The jar with the curl of paint on the sideboard looked like a jar that had once held jam and now held the idea of a threat, and the pig paperweight gazed through it as if life were a refracted thing. Alfred had already been out and back to the yard and had left wet prints on the flag where his boots had thought better of dripping themselves on the mat, and his whistle lay on the table next to a plate where two crumbs had learned each other’s names in the night and had not been disturbed because even crumbs were safe here. The day pressed its nose to the window and found it squeaked, and somewhere a rook caught itself in laughter at a joke about weather that only rooks understand.

Edie came before eleven in a coat the colour of brick dust and an umbrella that had signed a pact with the wind and looked pleased about it. She brought the tin again, and when Lyd said she had a tin for her, too, full of jam jars and the lid from the paint that had come off the door like a scab, Edie set them down side by side and made the face of a person who has been in a classroom long enough to know when to be stern with objects. She laid the things out on the table like cards and told Lyd the names we had always had for them and laid history on top where it would keep them from swelling. She said red thread likes to live across thresholds and round wrists, and iron nails are happiest at corners, and salt in a line is not the same as salt in a heap, and if you are fool enough to call a thing by its childhood name you had better be ready for it to come in with muddy feet, and Lyd listened because she had come to a point where refusing old housekeeping had been shown to be vanity.

“You want water that has already met salt,” Edie said, with the matter-of-factness of recipes. “Sea. If he’s what I think he is—and if he isn’t he’s decided to take the costume from the cupboard anyway—he won’t put a foot where oceans have spoken. We used to bring a bottle back from Bridlington and keep it where the good knives live. When trouble came we’d put our finger in it and draw a line where we needed a line, so what lives on one side knows itself, and what lives on the other side knows it has to ask permission. You can laugh, but laughing is like washing; you do it and then you find you needed to, else rot sets in.”

“I’m not laughing,” Lyd said, and found it was true. She thought of the river under the bridge where the boy had said his name like vocabulary, and of the Calder telling stories to the Humber like a cousin taking liberties, and of the way Jerry had slid through space as if the world were less solid for him than for the rest of them. “I’ll go to the sea. I haven’t seen it in a while. It will do me no harm to remember that what we call horizon is a lie we tell the day to keep it from running.”

Alfred made a noise that had in it pride and the bit of fear he did not let sit on his lap. He tied the red thread round his wrist again, because Edie had told him it wanted to learn the way out of the tin, and he kissed the iron key with a great show of seeing if it made any difference, and because he did it with a straight face the house made room for the possibility that it did. “Bring me back the smell of the seaside,” he said, taking the mick in a gentle way that let permission out of his pocket at the same time. “Don’t bring me cockles, I can’t stand a food that tries to tell me about its own sand.”

It took Lyd longer than she’d admit to get to the car because there is a weight in leaving when leaving feels like play at the edges of a war. She rang Uddin and said out loud the inches of what she was doing in case any of the inches needed a badge next to them, and the policewoman made the kind of sound over the phone that says you’re mad and I am going to let you be mad because it might save us all, and then told her good, bring me a litre if you can because evidence rooms like to smell like something other than pencil. Nathan messaged a photograph of the rope coiled properly like a polite snake and a line that said if we’re bringing the sea inland, bring vinegar for chips and superstition for appetites, and Hazel sent a heart, which is what phones know how to draw of courage. The road to the coast stitched towns together, and the moor tried to keep her by leaning into the wind, and then the sky got made large by its own hand and the colour of the day turned to a thing that is not in houses.

Saltburn was the same and not the same because every seaside town has learned that its job is to pretend time is prepaid but the fashions on the pier and the paint on the fish-and-chip shop facades will betray it. Lyd parked like a person who could parallel if she had to and chose to be kind to her own nerves and put the car where no one else wanted to be. She walked the last bit because the walking told her legs to keep belonging to her. The sea was a language she had learned by accident at twenty and had not had to speak often since, and it came back with the good fluency of old jokes. It slapped and it told and it breathed and it paid no attention whatsoever to the person who had come to borrow from it. She remembered, because a grandmother had told her while she was shelling peas and missed a few because she was telling the past, that once the men had run to the sea like that lad Ryley had run to air and brought it back in bottles because no one had told them yet that you need not hoard the thing that does not run out.

She knelt at the edge where the tide had graciously made a little shelf and unscrewed the lids of three brown bottles because glass matters and brown glass forgives errors. She dipped them in one at a time, as if anointing more than collecting, and the cold ran up her arms without asking consent but without cruelty. She thought of Jerry and said under her breath because the sea will swallow anything you care to say if you pitch it right, “Jeremiah,” and when the wave came in it hit the tops of her boots and slopped like laughter and she let the small indignity sit because the sea laughs when it’s right to, not when you ask it. She put the bottles in her bag with the care you give eggs and walked back up into chips and small dogs and a man with a kite that was not catching as much wind as it had hoped. On the pier she stopped because she had come this far and men with tattoos were teaching their little girls to throw their arms out and claim a width of sky, and that was bankable.

On the way home she looked at the road and didn’t look at the sea because she would have stayed, and staying is not virtue in a woman whose fences are being written on. She drove back into cloud and found that the moor had sat up and put its jaw out, which is what it does when it sees you’ve been to see another element. PC Uddin’s car was by the gate when she turned in, and it had another stripe on it, courtesy of someone who had not been dissuaded by police decals. The officer got out holding a bag as reverently as Lyd was holding her bottles, and lifted it like she might a baby at a christening. “We had a call,” she said without ceremony. “Old man found a boot on the Black Hagg side. Men’s. Newish. Tom Scarr’s mother cried before I had told her what colour the laces were. It’s his. It was in a place that said not pushed but placed, and yes, there’s paint on the heel and in the tread and nowhere else. I have seen men make display before. I am not impressed.”

“Tom,” Lyd said, because the boy’s name had become weight not sound, and she thought of the first paragraph of this story and how people walk home thinking they can hear their own footsteps, and how sometimes the ground listens. “We get him back in the ways that count,” she added, not making it a question because questions give weather an opening.

Uddin gave the bottles the kind of look a woman gives a recipe when she’s willing to be taught. “Salt,” she said. “We’ll do our own mixing. You and yours do your old bit and I’ll do mine and somewhere in the middle we’ll fence him in. He came by the house,” she added, with an eye at the door that did not accuse but was professional as brick. “You know that. The print says brush not hand, I’ll ask Wakefield to try something other than pig to tell us which animal he prefers to be. He’s laughing at what he thinks are our corners. I’ve asked for a warrant to go at the culvert with more men and spades than look reasonable. I intend to bring up every jar he’s made until he feels his pockets get lighter.”

They took the sea into the kitchen and poured it not into a jug but into three, because things in threes ask the mind to behave, and Hazel, when she came up with pies in a basket that had probably been made by a woman with fewer hours for nonsense than sense, put her finger into one of the jugs and drew a clean line down the back of Lyd’s door without making a production of it. “I sold three hats to women who said they’d never set foot over a stile,” she said, like a person who was taking roll call of a kind of courage. “Ruth’s liturgies are better than she thinks. The second one will make the old ladies tut because she says God like He’s a neighbour with a toolbox and not an emperor we need to polish our manners for, but they’ll come and they’ll sing, and I am of an age to think that your goblin hates a hymn if it’s sung by a voice that has washed many a small boy’s knees.”

There was a quiet at the back door that belonged to someone who did not ring bells because bells are for people who were named at fonts. The collie lifted his head and did nothing with it because he had learned that some things are best reported with eyes. On the threshold, a posy sat, neat and small as if a child had picked daisies and taught them to stand in ranks. The thread binding it was not red this time; it was white, and the white had been brushed with a whisper of lilac that made the hairs on Lyd’s arms stand up because he was adjusting his rules to suit his theatre. Uddin leaned and looked and did not touch and observed, almost academically, that posies used to be medicine when the smell of people and plague required kindness in the nose, and that there is a sacrilege in turning courtesies into threats. Lyd put the posy into a jar and the jar on the mantel where the dead photographs look at the living and the living look back, and she smiled into the glass like she had just remembered an insult and had saved a better one for later.

That afternoon made a slow move into evening the way a second-hand bookshop becomes closed without ever having been open for business hours. Alfred went to his chair and bolstered his knees, which had begun to sound like brittle branches, and declared he would not nap on political principle. Ruth came with her liturgy folded in half and the paper not thinking itself above the job, and she and Lyd and Hazel tried out syllables in the yard where the sky could weigh them. The words were cemetery-simple and good; they said the names of water as if they were people, called the stones old without asking them to give up the job, and made a place in the air for people who needed a sentence to hold. “We will borrow from the old without pinching,” Ruth said, and produced from her bag a long string of small bells made from bottle caps and stubbornness, which she handed to Alfred as if he could be trusted to set their noise going at a time that would make the world adjust its shirt collar. He looked at them like a man given a flute and asked if she expected him to go round the parish as a cat, and she told him cats are priests if you let them.

Evening took its hands off and let night work. When the dark had learned the yard’s shape without the torch, Nathan arrived with rope again and a face that said two births and one loss and a cup of coffee that smelled like second chances. He had found, he said, a run off the old scout shaft that would let them sprinkle what needed sprinkling without putting bodies where rocks wanted them, and he had two men from rescue who were willing to be paid in pie and superstition to haul salt in a way that would make Jerry choose another hobby. They went—Uddin, Nathan, Lyd, and one of the boys who had been at the bridge earlier and had grown up an inch since morning because he’d watched a lad be pulled out of stone and thought, I can do a fraction of that—and they shook salt out through a length of guttering that Nathan had conjured from a van like a magician tired of rabbits. The salt chalked every edge of the tunnel mouth and sat in the air like breath if breath had grit, and when Lyd leaned her head in and whispered Jeremiah she thought she heard the old culvert swallow and feel better for it.

Jerry watched from beyond the reach of the line, not because he had to, he told himself, but because he had rules and one said you learn your enemy’s hands. He saw the way the salt fell and he felt it in his altar of a chest, where the usual hate sits like milk on a hob and makes a skin. He felt it go thin at the edges, and this irritated him in ways shame never had time to. He would have to move his jars, and he did not like moving things once set, and this pettiness told him more about himself than he had hoped to know. So he went up-valley on shanks that liked hill more than road and made a small pilgrimage to a place his mother had told him never to put his feet; an old gin trench full of silt and dreams in a field a man with eyes like flint had claimed for his cows. There he set a new little house because he felt better for having one, and he told himself it was not running to move your chapel if the congregation had started bringing vials.

Holmfirth had a market and then it had a hall, and between those two the valley kept most of its saints. Hazel decided, which is to say she stood in the shop with the little strings of receipts that try to make sense of one another, and at half-past five she put a hand-lettered notice in the window that said bring what you have to the hall, tea at seven, no speeches, and she forgot to put no goblins because something in her kind heart believed that even he would think a church hall sacrosanct in the old way. People came with dishes that had provenance, casseroles that had been asked for by the same fork for twenty years and changed the seasoning according to who had died and who had been born. There was moorland lamb and questionable curry that would have been bang-on if anyone had trusted cumin, and pies the size of saucers and sandwiches made without much butter because someone’s husband had been scolded by a doctor and now the entire parish paid for that diagnosis. Ruth put a bowl beside the door because candle money had gone into it so easily, and someone had written on it in felt tip, coins for mountain rescue, notes for mothers, your name for tomorrow’s list, and no one complained at the order of it.

Lyd stood at the back and let herself be fed in that way women of a certain height and obligation hardly ever allow. The collie slept under a chair and earthquaked when someone touched his paws. Alfred sat with his bells and did not make them jangle because there are moments when men who love noise love silence more. PC Uddin came in without uniform because there is a way to be a citizen where showing a badge clouds your face, and she took a paper plate and an apple and leaned on the wall and watched the room with a satisfaction that had its own edges. Nathan did the rounds of the old women, which was his way of being sainted, and ended up with a plastic fork in his back pocket that he would take home and forget and find a week from now when the pocket had earned other sins.

Jerry, of course, could not help himself. He did not come in because his rules were not quite that far gone, but he stood under the window where the yellow light did the decent thing and spilled itself onto the lane, and he watched the shadows move across the floor like fish in knowledge. He left, on the sill, a neat little jar with a bow tied round the lid like a child’s party favour, and inside it a smear of the pale mauve and a scrap of paper in his good hand that said choose or I will. It sat for ten minutes among the vases because Hazel’s hand was busy pouring tea and because Lyd, for once, had let herself be distracted by a description of a cat’s foolishness. It was the collie who told the room before anyone’s nose did. He lifted his head, gave a one-bark that had only ever meant one thing since he was twelve weeks old—stranger—and put his chin on Lyd’s boot in the way he had learned when he’d needed her to test a thought. She turned, saw the small neatness of it glint, and moved in the way women move when they are hungry and have found hair in the butter.

She took a dishcloth, because house-pride is broader than people think, and picked the jar up with it like a person tender with nettles. Hazel found a box, the sort of thing biscuits arrive in when a niece in Halifax sends them for Christmas, and they put the jar in the box and closed the lid and tied the lid with the red thread off Alfred’s wrist because he had cut it in half for spite. Ruth crossed herself because sometimes habits are good tools regardless of your piety’s status, and Uddin wrote on a label with her tidy block capitals and smiled with only three teeth because you can be tired and still have your jokes. “He will hate that we looked after his thing,” she said and put the box on a chair where it could feel wished upon.

After tea, as people began to put their coats back on and the room became again a place where meetings happen and children get called by their whole names and a hundred tiny mercies take place with the stealth of professionalism, Hazel yelled in a voice that could call cows, “Sit,” and because she had been in charge since she was seventeen everyone sat without worrying too much why. She did not make a speech, because Hazel is better than that, but she said, in that tone she keeps for parents who need a prod, “We have been mixed since we stopped being a handful of families called the same thing. We are tea with biscuits, we are breath with weather, we are the colour you get when you let wool drink more than one dye because you are cheap or because you are clever. Anyone tries to tell you you’re only one thing, you show them your drawers. They will get bored before you run out.”

It had been a long day and the valley is not cut from theatre cloth, so the cheer did not split anyone’s eardrums, but it was felt, and you cannot always say what that feeling does in the bones of a place. People went home with leftovers in foil and obligations loosened and an extra candle because habit is a blanket. Lyd and Alfred walked the lane because the air was pretending to be clean, and the moon, which had been a gossip last night, had decided to be circumspect and half herself. At the gate, the baler twine had a new knot in it that neither of them had tied, a small, neat trick, and Lyd put her thumb on it and told it no and it came undone like a penny finally lifted from the tabletop by a patient child. She locked the door on the night because there are days when you think that keeps evil out even though you know most evils are smoke and know how to creep where no wood says stop.

Sleep was patchwork and did the job anyway. At three, Lyd woke not because of nightmare but because someone had decided to throw a handful of gravel at the window like boys did when they were still clever enough to ask. She went to the sash and did not pull it up because she had earned caution the hard way. On the yard, a figure stood with hands in pockets and the posture of a person who makes their own coat hang right by force of will. It was not Jerry; even in silhouette you could tell the difference between a thing that liked wriggle and a thing that had trained its body to be a post. PC Uddin looked up without apology and said, “I couldn’t sleep, and when I can’t sleep I do the rounds we agreed to do in day because day is for show and night is for work. Did you know there’s paint on your gate again. Not where you look, where you don’t. Under the latch, like a kiss. Lilac. He’s clambering like he owns his hands.”

Lyd swore in a manner that would have made her grandmother smack her head with a tea towel and put a dressing gown on and boots because the moor has killed better women than the ones who went outside with bare ankles. They went together and shone torches where they had decided not to before, and there, on the underside of the latch where any person with the mind of a ferret would look and any person with a normal mind would not, was a thin wash of pale that had dried too quickly and left the tiniest of brush marks like fingernail scratches in satin. “He wanted us to miss it,” Uddin said, with professional pleasure at the puzzle, and Lyd held the sea water up and watched the moon fall through it and said, “We will not.”

She poured a little into her palm and ran two fingers along the underside of the latch and the line where the gate meets the post, and the smell, which is older than paint and older than bad rules, rose and filled the yard with a lesson about sailors so simple it felt like church. The collie came and put his nose to the crack and sneezed like a gentleman and then wagged as if the sneezing had made him righteous. Alfred, who had not been sleeping either because men of his age get up at three to count sins and stare down heartburn, looked at the three of them with a gentleness that made Lyd want to break and would not. “He took my whistle,” he said then, as if to apologise for having nothing else to bring into the conversation. “Off the mantel. When we were at the hall with the pies. I reached for it, and there’s the mark where it lay and there’s no whistle. I know every ghost of my own house, and that ghost says absent.”

Uddin swore and did it neatly, which is a skill they do not teach at Hendon. Lyd’s throat did a thing it had not done since she was fourteen and a teacher had pinched her with language. It was not the whistle—it could have been the bell rope, the jam pan, the photograph with the crease in it of a woman who had her face but not her patience—it was the reaching. Jerry had put his hand where men had hung hats, and had taken a small thing that made corners into sentences. “He’s writing his name on our mantel,” she said, and Uddin set her jaw like a woman about to go to a family wedding she had hoped would be cancelled. “Then we take the mantel down and make a better one,” the officer said, and if the metaphor was rough it did the work. “And we hang his name on our hooks and call it evidence until it’s obituary.”

The morning came late as if it had been detained elsewhere. Lyd took the bottles of sea water and walked each of the bounds she could reach with a pail and a free hour, and where the merestones stood she put a wet handprint on them as if baptising stone, and where a wall had a gap she made a small river and watched it find the lower line all by itself like water does. She stopped by the spot where Tom’s boot had been found and speak his name because you do not ask the moor to give back a thing unless you have said the exact thing you want set on your table. By the old packhorse bridge she met a man mending a bicycle with great exasperation and a smarter pair of pliers than any she’d ever managed to keep, and because this is how a valley relieves itself she ended up helping him hold the light while he swore in two languages with dignity and then thanked her like she had taught his wheel to be round.

When she got back to the yard the day had learned shouting. Nathan’s van was there with its rear doors open like a mouth that had been caught singing, and on the step of the van lay three things wrapped in plastic with police labels and anger inside. One was the whistle, deep-scratched where a hand with opinions had pressed too hard and carried it and had not been able to help making marks. One was a small flat paint tin half full of the lilac mixture, and a strand of hair was stuck in it that was not a hair any of them owned. One was a page out of a book Lyd had not seen, and that book had been a guide to the parish in a century when ladies carried parasols and men knocked their top hats together and still fell in the rivers because rivers enjoy equality. The page was the page on Follybridge, and on it a hand Lyd knew traced all the gates and called them by names they had not had in print. He had written inside her hedges as if they were a margin he could own.

“We nicked his pocket,” Uddin said without triumph, because she knew triumph invites backlash. “Edie’s cousin—don’t look at me that way, cops have cousins—saw a man with a face that looked like it had been trimmed badly by a well-meaning aunt, and he was standing under the ginnel at Kirkgate watching the school in a way that made her remember the time she was nine and kicked a boy called Martin. She coughed like a person who wants to announce a presence, and he flinched and his bag gave a sigh, and he ran, and she is sixty-two and full of good spite, and she put her stick across his shin the way she would across a badly behaved stove, and down he went, and he left us these. It’s not a lot, but it’s more than I had before you went to the sea.”

If there is a time to pray it might be when an old woman uses her stick in a ginnel with no one to see but her shadow and God, and Lyd made a mental note to put a pie in Edie’s oven without letting her see, and also to give her cousin the good packet of tea. She put her hand on the whistle through the plastic and did not pick it up because Uddin had trained her to resist the urge to hold the thing that you think belongs to you. The page on Follybridge made her feel for a moment like she had been seen from above by someone who did not understand scale. It also gave her an idea that sat in her chest like something that might fire. “If he’s mapping,” she said, half to the room and half to the moor that has better ears than some men, “then we choose the place he thinks he knows best and we make it wrong by a hair. We turn a gate into a maze, a latch into a question, a boundary into a mirror. He hates smudges. We are going to smudge.”

They set to in the afternoon like bakers with a new oven. Hazel found a coil of rope and three old curtains in the church cupboard that had been bright in 1973 and had forgiven a lot, and they strung them along the yard in a way that made the space truthfully itself and not itself at all. Ruth, whose Latin for Lyd had been rope once when they were girls under a desk at school, wrote on paper and stuck the paper to posts and made the words say things that were true and also not true if you approached from the wrong end, and laughed wickedly once and said God has always liked mazes, we’re only giving Him a chance to enjoy a local one. Nathan chalked lines on the stones, not straight, just shy of straight, and big enough to offend a man who tidied the edges of his own malice, and in the corners of the chalk he put small dabs of sea salt so anyone trying to correct the chalk would get stung and blame themselves. Uddin placed a camera where the camera could see and where Jerry’s eye would not. Alfred, who was meant to be only using his eyes, went to each threshold and drove one iron nail in by fingertip and then his thumb and then with the back of the Rayburn spoon because he had made an oath to himself not to use a hammer when it would wake the dead and his neighbours, and the sound of iron in wood made the afternoon think better of itself.

The first time Jerry came he did not come all the way to the yard because even he had habits about other people’s houses that had hung around from when doors were made of wood you could trust. He stood at the wall and licked a finger and held it up and tried to read the room like weather, and for once the room did not tell him what he needed. He hated that. He came the second time with a plan, which was to say he came to leave an insult and a mark, and he got through the first part with no bother because insults cost him nothing, but the second failed him because when he reached for the latch his hand felt wet and stupid, and not the rich kind of wet he liked to think he was, but a wet with grit in it, and his fingers thought about for the first time in a long time whether the thing they were doing had an audience. He did not say Jeremiah out loud, because he had learned, but something in his ears said it all the same, and it is a truth that most of us cannot bear our whole names spoken with love or malice without something in us turning to listen.

That night the moor let go of the fog and offered stars like stitches, and the wind went elsewhere to scold. Lyd sat on the back step with the whistle, finally, because Uddin had nodded and had put the plastic away and brought her the thing itself like a midwife with a baby, and she polished it with a cloth that had once been a shirt that had once been a man. Alfred slept in his chair with the little bells on his knee and his mouth open and the dignity of the elderly who do not care who sees what their bodies do when they are not watching. The collie lay on the threshold and dreamed rabbits into metaphors. The jar on the mantel held the curl of paint and the room held breath because a plan is a living thing for a while and its life is short and bright. Somewhere down in the bottom of the valley the culvert learned what it was to have salt in its joints and changed its mind about which way it wanted to drain. Somewhere up near Wessenden a boy took his phone out and put it away again because the lad he wanted to call would not answer, and he would try again and then he would come to the hall and stand in the light and say his name in full, and the room would say it back, and Ruth would pretend not to cry, and Hazel would not bother.

Before dawn, a shriek cut the dark in a way that you do not forget. It was not human, which is to say it was not designed to make you bring your own name into it, but it belonged to the part of the world that shares distance with us. It came from the direction of the builder’s yard and was followed by a drummer’s run of clatter. Lyd and the collie were up and booted in a minute because once your house has been written on you keep your coat near. At the yard, under the arch of corrugated tin that had softened in rain and sun and bad jokes, a fox lay on its side and looked sorry for having been born, its flank marked with a pale smear that had dried wrong and cracked and then wet again and the crack had hurt. The smell was this man’s business, and for the first time Lyd let the disgust show on her face because there are things you can be polite about and things you must name. Nathan arrived with a blanket and the fox’s ribs moved too fast and Hazel produced a shallow box from somewhere because shops never lose their knack for boxes, and they lifted the animal like it was someone’s lost glove, and they made it not die, and it did not die, and that was a small thing that turned out to be a large thing because three children had seen Lyd kneel and not mind, and that will keep a valley from saying yes to a despot when he offers neatness for costs.

Morning, when it came properly, brought a message on the parish page from someone who spelled like rain smells and had a profile picture of a sunset. It said the walk would be again that evening, and if you wanted to bring salt bring it, and if you wanted to bring your father you could, and if you wanted to bring your ridiculous dog no one would call you ridiculous to your face. Ruth added the liturgy in both versions and underlined the bit about water with three small waves drawn by a vicar who knows children like pictures. PC Uddin put a formal notice underneath that said in words that had never expected to be on a Facebook page that there would be a police presence and if anyone had ideas about masks they could take them to a bonfire where there was supervision. Hazel put emojis that were probably cows. Lyd put nothing because she was better in mud than on screens, but she went into the kitchen and took the sea and poured a little into a jug and then another jug and set them both beside the door.

She stood a long moment with her hand on the door-frame and thought of the first time she had been told that lady was a sticker you could peel and how she had laughed and tried and found glue sticks better than some titles. She thought of Jerry as a boy he had maybe been and the mother who had warned him not to look at the wrong thing and the father he might not have had, and she nearly found a corner of softness and then remembered Tom’s boot and the jar under the arch and how he had said stop mixing and meant stop living. She took the whistle to her mouth and did not blow it and felt its coolness with her tongue and thought of the note saying choose your ditch and how she had chosen the sea and the stream and the guttering under the eaves and any other watery thing the valley could be made to understand. She opened the door, and the day lifted its shoulder and pretended to be surprised she had asked it to dance, and if there is a rule that will hold in this parish, it is this: if a thing comes to your gate and tells you to step off your path, you take two steps further on it and make the path wider, and you do not burn your hedges for the sake of a clearer view.Chapter Eight

Morning laid itself flat as a bolt of calico over the valley and asked to be cut to shape. The fog had gone like a guest that overstayed decently and knew when to go, and in its place came a skim of cold that made the first breath in the yard a lesson. Lyd stepped out with the sea in three brown bottles in the pocket of her coat and felt the air pick and choose which bit of her to keep. The oak had a rime along the south side of its bark where the night had thought about hoar and thought better, and the collie went out, did the social business with the lane, and came back with the expression of a diplomat. Alfred sat with the newspaper folded small as an envelope and did not pretend he was reading it; he was planning, which in a man like him looked like making a list of tools. “He’ll hate us for the sea,” he said cheerfully when she put the bottles on the table, and he put his finger in one and drew a tiny, precise line along the lip of his mug and raised it to his mouth like a man tasting a sauce in a kitchen that did not belong to him. “Good. Let him have a proper job for once.”

By nine, the parish had its choreography. Ruth had come with her two liturgies folded into a third, an amalgam made from the pieces that had made old ladies purse their mouths and teenagers snigger and then unexpectedly sit up straighter, and the paper with its ink that had come from somewhere other than a printer made a small virtue of itself on the table. Hazel, whose house contained a cupboard that spawned flasks in numbers that would have embarrassed a scout hut, packed tea into a quantity of metal that said winter rugby and funerals, and she added into the basket a lump of cheese that had been pressed with a thistle and wrapped in cloth that smelt faintly of someone’s loft. PC Uddin came down the lane in the car the goblin had decorated and got out with a warrant in one sheaf and a thermos in the other and the look of a woman who knows her day will not stay on the lines. “Wakefield,” she said, by way of salutation, “woke on the right side of bed. I have paper that says we can go at the culvert, and more that says we can go at the gin trench up by Intake without waiting for men in suits to give me permission from a room where the only wet is in a vase. Mountain rescue will meet us at noon and swear at me in their polite manner. Until then I will pretend I am only here for tea.”

Jerry woke mean and stayed mean. The salt had got into his head in the night and turned his dreams into little marbles he could not catch, and he hated salt for the way it refused to become part of any plan that wasn’t bigger than him. He packed because he liked to pretend that moving was his idea. He wrapped his brushes in the shirt he kept for good, which was a shirt he had never actually worn and only handled when he wanted to have a prop for the life where he belonged at tables, and he told himself names for his colour that would make it more than a mix. He went to the shelf with the jars and he took three and knocked a fourth by accident with the ridge of his wrist, and the glass did what glass does when it is reminded it is merely cold sand glued back to itself, and it shattered into opinions. He did not say the bad word because he had taught himself not to enjoy the small relief of swearing when he could put that impulse into the big relief of controlling and hurting, and he scraped up what was left of his own neatness and hated himself for having to. He thought of the woman with the light and the man with the whistle and the old woman with the stick in the ginnel and he told himself he respected them, and he knew that respect in his mouth came out tasting like the thin skin of milk you peel off and throw to the cat. He took the bundle and the tin and the pocket book with the edges of maps from a time when lines had more pomp and no mercy, and he went into the tunnel with his head low, and the salt told him to duck in a voice that sounded like someone else’s victory.

The second walk was a bigger animal than the first. Word had done its work, and fear had been made into work also, which is the decent thing to do with it, and the hall coughed up people like a chimney that had started right. The children who had been carried last time walked this time, holding hands with one another and not their mothers as if the village were a single small animal at loose ends. Men brought sticks and women brought bells and two lads in hoodies that had seen better zip pulls brought a drum that had a crack in it and made do. Ruth stood in the doorway with both liturgies in one hand and a pencil behind her ear and gave small, simple orders to a dozen souls who had forgotten that they wanted to fight her authority. PC Uddin looked at people’s shoes and redistributed feet like a stage manager with a taste for outdoor performance. Nathan had rope and a smile and a grim little kit in his pocket that made people feel less foolish for carrying nothing but sandwiches. Hazel handed out torches and hats and a packet of toffees so hard they would outlast trouble, with the caveat that anybody choking on them could answer to Nathan’s wounded look.

They took the merestones as you would a staircase you’d used as a child: hand on the rail, eye on the worn bit where other feet had gone, a light tap for memory. The sea water ran down the old stones like a blessing that had decided to be practical, and the salt sat in corners like a cat of uncertain temper. Ruth read whenever she felt the air accept a sentence, not to fill silence but to make it hold the right thing, and when she came to the bits about water she changed the wording, because she had been to the sea once in a blue dress and had not liked the taste of it, and now she needed to. “We call you Calder, and we call you Holme, and we call you clough and clapper and cut,” she said, voice neither posh nor village but vicar, and the people whose great-grandparents had broken their backs for other men’s ideas paused long enough to let their own bones remember. Alfred carried the bottle-cap bells and shook them as if he had been entrusted with a colt that needed to know the route and would kick if you were not light.

At Black Hagg a new band of lilac shone smugly on a step and two boys half his age had the sense to be furious and then to behave. Lyd read the mark like writing and wiped it with brine that came from a place Jerry would not go, and the colour turned paler and then paler still and then disappeared not into the stone but into the air, and the air took it and changed none. Hazel laughed then, a small bark like the collie’s, and said, “Not everything you put down belongs,” and a child near her took that word and kept it for later. They went on, the way people go on when it is not usefulness that moves them but repetition, which in villages is a motor as sweet as any tractor if that tractor will only start.

At the packhorse bridge, a little string of jam-jars stood and the candles inside guttered because the day had turned unreliable and the wind was a friend wanting to show off. Someone had put a feather where the usual note about a piano teacher might go, and Lyd flicked it away with a minute check to see if Uddin had her eyebrows up, which she did. Under the arch, there was no new jar because Jerry did not waste theatricals where an audience had lately eaten, but there was a smear on the stone you put your palm on as you lean, and it was so delicate that if you had not been taught to notice you would not. Lyd put her hand over it the way a woman might lay a hand over a teacup to keep flies out, and she felt through skin to skin something that wasn’t exactly a heat. “He wants it to feel like part of the place,” she said, low for Nathan’s ear and Uddin’s notebook, “but the place has its own taste and he can’t cook with it.”

The gin trench sat in a fold of the field that had been a trench when men thought it sensible to slice into marsh and say now you will behave, and it had been filled three times and sunk four. The grass over it had the look of hair over a scar. Men from mountain rescue were there with good boots and rope and a vocabulary of caution, and they greeted the crowd with the friendliness of people who do not want to have to save amateurs from their own interest. Uddin held up the warrant and did not wave it like bunting because it was not that sort of day, and one of the lads—that was the proper age—looked at the paper as if he might have an opinion and then nodded because he had already sorted the kit that would not get either of them killed. They put a frame over the old mouth like a doctor puts fingers on a pulse, and in went the camera, and on came the monitor in the van, and the moor had its photograph taken from the wrong side. Vines had crept in where people had failed, and old brick whose poor was someone else’s profit showed its belly. There were shelves of mud that once were steps for shins, and in one recess the thing all of them had come to see: jars, in a row, tucked into a hollow like eggs in a box.

Nathan swore without words, which was a thing you do with shoulders and breath, and the rescue lad said he could get at the first and second without needing to dig a soul’s grave, and Uddin agreed without making it a command that finds its way later into court as arrogance. The rope measured out, and the lads went down like verse is supposed to scan. They came up with glass and old hair and a smell that made Hazel swear and apologise to no one but her own sense of what is owed to air, and the labels were made with block letters and the day adjusted to the knowledge of being catalogued. One jar had a button in it, another had the bit of ribbon that had been taken from the merestone, another had a coin in it that looked like it had been put there by a hand that did not understand currency or had decided to misunderstand on purpose. The fourth jar would not come because mud had had it, and the fifth, when the boy got his hand to it, came with a little live squeal of suction that put skin on everyone’s teeth. In the sixth, when brought to the light and held to its own false grace, there were two boot laces and something that had once had texture and now had only the idea.

“What are we looking at,” Uddin said to the rescue lad with a flatness she used when she had to help someone else be less shaken than their body wanted to be.

“The place he prays to and the place he hides in,” the lad said, without making a point of how he did not mean God or a chapel, because he had been taught by his grandmother to say clear things where people could trip. “And a souvenir stall.”

Tom was not there, and the knowledge came as both relief and harm because an answer hurts as much as a corpse in certain lights. Lyd took the small coil of laces and tucked it into a bag with a hand that did not jerk at the last second, and she thought like a farmer thinks: if this hole has been used, there is another, and if there is another, it is not up here where the salt is a threat to a tidy man. “Stone cold bright,” she said to herself, and then she said it to Uddin because saying things aloud made them belong to more than one head. “He spoke of a stone and a cold and a bright. The reservoir sluices are stone. The water under there is cold in a way you can’t argue with. The grating shines when the sun catches it and looks like someone who got rich. It’s a nasty bright. That could be where a rule-keeper hides things.”

“We’ll put a guard there and call Leeds for a man with a hat who likes to say he is a specialist and bring him without his hat and make him earn the weight of his boots,” Uddin said, and got her phone out and said sentences that were turned into dispatches in a room with a dry floor. She looked then to Lyd the way sometimes she did when she had to check she was doing her job in the right parish. “We do two things at once. We pull up every jar before he can write a treatise about his need for them, and we make the water decide for us. You—” and she looked at Nathan and the rescue lads and then back to the group entire, “—have work with rope and spades, which is what you came to us to be given. The rest of us will walk with kettles and a recipe Ruth made for saying names at stones that aren’t graves and will damn well not become ones.”

If the day had been only mud and jars and the feeling of being too late without being late at all, it would have been enough to fill a week. The trap had to happen the same day because Lyd had learned the pace of men like Jerry and it was brisk, and because you do not leave China out in a house where you know a child who kicks. They went back to Follybridge and set the yard the way she had planned with Uddin and Nathan and Alfred and Hazel and three teenagers who had the capacity to be nimble when they could be bothered. The chalk was laid in lines that almost made sense and then did not when you looked again, the kind of sense a fox would laugh at. The sea water was poured in a cross under the latch where only fingers that had no shame would go. The red thread was run not straight and not in a way a ribbon could be laughed at, but in a web that connected the old iron nail heads as if memory could be strung. There was a posy, because bait sometimes is not only the obvious, and it was made of hawthorn in leaf and a sprig of rosemary swiped from Ruth’s parsonage bed without apology and a lacing of grass that had been cut the long way, with the blade. It had no ribbon, and that was a statement.

Uddin put the camera where the camera could be a magpie with more luck. Nathan had rope but not in such a way as to make the yard a proof of his trade. Alfred had the bells and a stick and a pocket with an old coin in it, and he had decided at last that superstition has only ever been a name other people give your habits when they don’t have your weather. Hazel left the front door of the shop on the latch and stuck a note on it that said back in ten because the valley knows when a woman is lying for a cause and will not grass. Ruth put her liturgy in her pocket and tied a string of bottle-cap bells across the gate because some noises tell some creatures that they are being foolish, and she hoped this was one. Lyd took the whistle, hung it on a nail, looked at the nail, and then put the whistle on a hook a hand’s breadth to the left of where it had always lived. It would not matter to a person who didn’t know the house. It would make a man like Jerry itch.

Dusk came reluctantly, like a dog being asked to leave a warm rug. Lyd lit no lanterns because light calls its own audience, and because the yard had enough bright lines in chalk to make a man frown. The collie lay not at the threshold but half in the kitchen and half on the flags, and if you had asked him he could not have told you why he had picked that position, and if you had told him he was a curtain he would have disagreed. The first noise was not footsteps because Jerry was not careless. It was the pre-noise that comes when someone has admonished their body to be small. He came to the gate and breathed at the latch and waited for the latch to betray the salt with a smell so thin it could be mistaken for memory. He slid a hand under and his skin learned the sea in the way a child learns a new swear, in a rush, with delight and wickedness and an immediate knowledge of the consequences. He did not snatch it back because he had spent years training small parts of himself not to betray big aims, but the line of his shoulder went wrong into his set of wrongnesses.

He stepped, because he could not not. The chalk took his foot and told it a lie, which was that straight will get you home, and the foot told the leg, and the leg told the back, and in a man who has always believed that the shortest line is virtue this is your only kindness. He began to walk the misline, and it pleased something awful and tidy in him to follow an instruction he had not himself given, and that pleasedness brought him another inch in. Lyd let him, because floors are teachers and haste is a thief, and she counted a beat and three and lifted her chin at Uddin in the window where the camera saw, and Uddin nodded like a woman with a game bird in the pantry. Hazel, who had never fancied herself a general, felt bossy and did not hate it, and put her hand on the bell string, ready to make a wrong noise when a wrong hand went for the right kind of latch.

He was smaller in the yard. It was not that his bones seemed fewer, though that was true if you looked dead-on, but rather that the place did not allow his laugh to echo. He smiled to make the edges of himself feel their lines and saw on the bench that someone had placed a posy that had thought thrown at it. He moved towards it and the chalk asked him to go round the long way, which he did because he could no more deny a tidy direction than a bee could ignore a bloom. He put out a hand and his finger brushed rosemary and he jerked like an old dog looks up when a child drops chips. It was not that it hurt him; it said something he did not expect to be told by a plant. He took the posy and this was the moment, and Lyd moved like weather. She had the coin on her tongue for the old rule that had last been used by a woman with no teeth and a house with a clean doorstep. She had a thread between two fingers, pulled up and set so it would catch at any shape that did not remember being human. She had breath and she used it. “Jeremiah,” she said, in the same tone she had used to call a ewe in from a storm when the ewe had got too proud to admit she was cold. “Where is Tom?”

He fought because he had rules and one of them was never answer when the word is yours. He tried to say something clever because that is what he had when the rules did not quite cover the day. He made the first noise—a laugh—that always did him good service, and found it fell in the yard like a biscuit in tea that is too strong and unforgiving. The coin in Lyd’s mouth made the vowel of his name go true through the air, and because he had lived so long in pretend bows and pretend laughs this truth cut. His hand tightened on the posy and the rosemary bit him a small bit anyway and he spat, not blood, because the world is not daft enough to give us that, but opinion, which in men like him is more potent than bodily fluent. “Stone,” he said, because he could not help starting with the word he had been idolising. “Cold. Bright. You said it. You’re good at this game,” and he would have stopped there and made a jink away into cleverness if it had been any room but this one. “Old valve under the draft at Butterley,” he blurted, and there went half his power because it had been given instead of taken, and the coin picked the drizzle of truth out of the muck he had wanted to pour. “He tastes of iron. He’s not drowned. I’m not wasteful. I’m not—”

“Kind,” Hazel said from the doorway as if reading out a grocery list, and in her mouth the word was a stone a man could trip on. “You’re not kind. That’s the word you’re trying and failing to audition for.” She pulled the bell string then because there was a flinch in Jerry’s shoulder that belonged to a body that was about to remember it was good at running. The sound was such a cheerful wrongness that it made him go still, because for a second he remembered a different day when he might have been made to stand and clap and behave. In that second Nathan moved from where a wall makes you shadow and went at Jerry’s legs like a scrum he had loved when he was soft and younger. Red thread, when tied around the wrist of a thing that wins by slither, is perhaps the only gift a story can take from itself and turn into something that works in a kitchen. Lyd looped it and the thread did not burn or shriek or any such fair nonsense; it settled into being, and Jerry looked at it with a personal affront that had nothing to do with magic and everything to do with control.

Uddin did the only thing that made any sense to a part of the world that needed boxes to tick as well as jars to empty. She stepped forward with a pair of handcuffs that had come on a government docket and clicked them in place on a wrist that had just learned red. He hissed because he was not used to the weight of other people’s metal on his own urge to mark, and his eyes went wide, and for the first time in a year Lyd thought he looked his age—which was to say all ages and none, but particularly the bit between a boy and a man when boys make rules because rules feel like muscles. “Jeremiah Whit,” Uddin said, speaking the name fully because someone’s cousin had found it in a council ledger and because the yards had been waiting to hear it spoken like that. “I am arresting you on suspicion of abduction, criminal damage, theft, assault, and whatever else this day decides to confess before tea. You do not have to say anything, but if you do not, and if you later do, your silence will have less theatre than your usual taste, and I will not be impressed. Do you understand?”

He smiled because he was a creature that knew how to show his teeth in any weather, and then he spat and it landed on the chalk and made a tiny clean dot, and this offence to tidiness bothered him more than the cuffs. “You’re mixing,” he said to Lyd, with a reverence only a purist can give to something he hates. “You’ve poured your sea into your farm and your church into your yard and your gossip into your police. It’s obscene. It’s wrong. It’s clever. You will have to pay. I’ll have the bill sent to your soul.”

“You’ll send it to my door,” Lyd said evenly, because the only way to answer melodrama is to needle it with a better everyday. “And I’ll put it under the sugar and forget it. Where’s the key to the valve?” She did not expect him to have it because she was used to men like him having influence where they could not reach a knob, but she asked because questions are fences and because the coin was still on her tongue and its weight could be useful for one more pull. He made no answer, and this time the truth did not drop off him like scale. He moved his wrists in the cuffs as if the movement might persuade them to drop the habit of being useful, and Alfred, who had once put his hands into the hair of a bull without being hit, stepped closer than a wise man should, his bells silent for once. “You look tired,” Alfred said, and in his mouth tired was a curse. “We’re going to make you more tired. You’ll sleep in a room with light at wrong times. You’ll learn that not all lines are yours to draw. You’ll remember your mother, or the thing that wore the sound of her, and you’ll hate it for having told you that you deserve the wall. Then you’ll learn to live with it, like the rest of us who were told stupid things.”

The car took him because cars are part of this story as much as streams, and Uddin put him in with the care a person saves for lifting a box with a spider in it when there is a child watching. He sat, and the lilac stripe on the bumper caught the yard light, and he smiled at it like an old friend, and then he winced because the sea had got under the nail of his thumb and set up shop. “We go now,” Uddin said to the watching that had assembled without clapping, and she shut the door on the goblin and his rules. “Nathan, you and me and two from rescue and anyone who can keep their knees under them without help to the valve at Butterley.” She met Lyd’s eyes and did not say don’t come and did not say come; she did not have to. “Hazel, you shut your door and you lock it and you let nobody in who doesn’t have your phone number and a good reason. Ruth, keep the kettle on and lie to anyone who you need to until we have something that isn’t the word hope. Alfred, if you’ve another coin in your house for love of God put it somewhere I won’t find and then tell me where it is. Lady Follybridge—” and the use of the Lady made the yard stand up a little and made Lyd wish less than she might have for a smaller name, “—bring your sea.”

The valve sits where men put it when they wanted water to obey. The path to it is the sort people say do not exist and that teenagers find at once and torch with their phones. The stone works look like something built by a small empire that wanted to last longer than its budget, and in summer there is lolling and in winter there is sheet ice that writes stories on old women’s hips. Tonight it was cold and bright with a nasty bright and the stone breathed and there was noise in the water that could be laughter if you were the sort to attribute such generosity to a fluid. The grate showed its teeth to the lamp like a brag. Nathan went down the steps with a coil of rope and knees that complained because knees are the palimpsest on which a life writes its weather. The rescue lads went with a basket of the sort that should only ever carry sleeping babies and too often carries men who swore they were not drunk and were wrong. Lyd went down with a bottle and the sea went down with her and she put it to the iron and the iron did not answer but the men did, because superstition is a language you never meant to learn and discover you speak when it counts.

At the bottom, where the water has a voice and the iron has a hand, there was a thing that had been made aggressive on purpose: a wheel, and a lock. Tom’s boot lace was there in the corner where someone had left something after leaving something else, and the taste in the air was wrong the way cheap perfume is wrong in a church. Nathan shouted a slow word up the steps that meant weight and care and two people and a lever, and the lever came, and the care came, and the weight, to its credit, did not throw any of them into a story you have to send flowers for. The valve had a trick, as every valve does. Jerry had placed a sliver of metal in a groove in such a way that the wheel could turn and show off and nothing would change, and this was his nature made engineering. Uddin swore in the quiet way she does when mechanics are rude to her, and Nathan laughed because he had seen men put coins in meters to fool landlords and you cannot shock a man who has worked ambulances at two in the morning. He put his fingertips where the cold could tell him he had skin and felt for the sliver and found it and fetched it out with the pocket blade Lyd had sworn was for twine, and it cut the pad of his thumb as if the valve wanted blood and he told it, not tonight. The wheel moved when moved and the water answered like a blunt man giving you his name for the first time. There was a sucking and a change in the note and then a cough that belonged to both stone and river, and under it, in that ugly lovely sound a body makes when a tight thing lets it change its mind, there was another sound, thinner and madder, the sound a man makes when he is learning he is still a person.

Tom Scarr came back into the world without much grace. He came thin and white in the face and his eyes had seen too much of a kind of dark that is not night, and he did not like being pulled at, and he did not like salt in his mouth, and he liked Lyd’s hand under his head as little as any boy likes a woman's hand when he has done something stupid and is going to have to admit it. But he came, and when he breathed the air did the decent thing and went in and out, and Nathan made his jokes about soup and good behaviour and not making him look foolish in front of the lads, and Uddin had her face on that made judges forget their first thought, and Tom said, in an accent he had thought he had left behind because towns do that to boys, “Mum,” and Hazel, who had no business being there and was there anyway because a valley holds hands and pretends it is a coincidence, said back, “She’ll be here the second you decide to sit up,” and he did because he was not idiotic enough to fight every woman in the valley at once.

Back at the yard, the bells on the gate rang because the collie had knocked them with a wag and because the night needed to have a sound that wasn’t water or men’s boots or the human noise on the back-end of fear. Jerry sat in the back of the police car with his head turned like a crow and watched the way a village can be itself in an emergency, which is to say better than in many other times, and he smiled because he had given them their day and therefore owned some of the feeling they were having. He set his shoulder to the door without conviction because he had learned doors are less cooperative than rules. He looked at the lilac stripe on the bumper and decided if there had to be a joke, it might as well be this one, and he felt a small prickle in his thumb where the sea had stung him and it made his mouth go sharp, and he repeated to himself, silent and small, the thing people like him say when goodness embarrasses them: it won’t last. He had no idea, because monstrousness is as blinkered as goodness, that lasting was the wrong measure.

The night did what nights do to days like that: it trimmed them a little, it put the edges in, it reminded all involved that there would be more work in the morning, and there is not a story alive that becomes sense in one go. Lyd went home with dried sea on her cuffs and water in her hair and iron on her mouth and a new line in her head where an old line had been. She wiped the salt off the latch because iron will rust if you love it too desperately, and she lifted the bottle to the shelf and put it beside the pig and the jar with the curl of paint and the key that had never opened anything and the posy now dry and yet still insolent. Alfred was asleep in the chair and the bells had made a small nest of sound on his knee and he looked like a man who had fought and had been allowed to sit down, which is a gift not every man gets in his life. Hazel had gone off with Tom in Nathan’s van and a blanket that had been blessed by the church by accident and on purpose both, and Ruth had left a sheet of paper on the table that had, in Lyd’s own, plain, wicked, hand, the instruction for the bit of the liturgy you say when you bring someone back from a machine. Uddin left the car at the road end and walked the last way because she wanted to feel the ground, and because there are nights when you need to listen for the sludge of mischief that is not yet done.

Under the culvert, the salt sat, and a rat went to lick it and did not, and that saved its life and cost it a story to tell its children. Up by the gin trench a fox with a bare patch where élitist paint had lifted skin wove itself into gorse and dreamed of chickens who had also survived something. Down in Wakefield someone who had never seen Black Hagg put a file in a drawer and thought of their lunch. In the tunnel that had been Jerry’s first altar and then his second, the jars settled to dust in a temper that had nothing to do with men, because glass has a clock and it does what it pleases. The merestone with the rude carving wore a salt handprint like a meringue and thought nothing of it, because stones have their own vanity. The bridge remembered a boy’s shoulder and a woman’s coin and a prayer that had not said God out loud and liked it. The sea lay a long way off and said to itself in chuckle and sigh, I do not have to go anywhere to be in everything, and it was not wrong.

In the hour before dawn that belongs to people with conscience and babies and the badly organised, Lyd got up because sleep is a blanket with holes when you are in the middle of a row, and she went to the door and stood and listened. The yard had its own story and she had been in it long enough to read, and the chapter it wanted to write said: not over. She let herself stand in that and feel the weight and the small victory and the larger push. She thought of the phrase choose your ditch and felt a laugh come that had no spite in it. “We choose the one that takes all rivers,” she said, not to be clever but because the phrase had landed at last, and the collie huffed approval as if she had finally thrown the ball far enough to be worth his legs. She looked at the whistle and at the nail where it now lived, and she left it where it was, because a woman learns where to keep her tools without asking every night what a man would do, and outside, under the first tatting of birds, a thing that hated smudges lay in a cell that smelled of the lives of men and decided that rules could be sharpened and turned into knives, and the valley, without asking permission, began the work of blunting them.Chapter Ten

The valley woke with the odd modesty of a place that has surprised itself. It stretched its lanes and found them still underfoot, tested the bridges with a whisper of water and got no complaint, and sent the rookery into parliament in case decisions had to be made. Lyd stood in the kitchen and watched steam lace the window where cold had drawn its own ferny handwriting in the night. The jar with the curl of paint had been moved an inch by accident and it looked smaller for the disruption, which pleased her. Alfred had already traced a damp finger along the table edge and declared the Rayburn needed her riddle solved later, and he was reading the court pages as if the magistrate might be hiding behind an advert for stairlifts. The whistle on its new hook had learned the shape of the nail already, and that, too, pleased her. In the yard the collie made a circuit like a priest and checked where the salt lines met the stones; if dogs had tongues for superstition he would have passed an opinion.

By ten the first car with plates from elsewhere nosed the lane like a rat, and then another behind it with a logo on its flank that knew the price of a headline. Hazel had seen them earlier on the road and had put in the window of the shop a notice that said press is a plant, grows where you water it, and had made her hair pins look like armour. The bell she had on today had a note that said mind your voice and she used it. “We are a village not a theatre,” she told a woman with eyes like cold tea and a pen that had bitten three men already. “We sell screws and we sell stamps. If you want statements buy bread.” The woman bought two loaves and tried to ask the flour if it knew how to cry, and Hazel buttered the silence with an offer of a hat and the reminder that hats do better outdoors and journalists do better away from soup.

PC Uddin came up the lane between cars as if she were late to her own party and had decided that being composed was half the battle. Her uniform did the work of saying the day had to pass through a filter. “We put him before the magistrates this afternoon,” she said to Lyd without preamble, and the pronoun had in it all the years of having to take the human out of a problem so the law could fit. “Remand is called for. He has asked for you.”

“Asked for me?” Lyd felt the word walk up her spine and reach for a chair it had no business sitting on. “What for, an audience?” She tapped the jar with her knuckle, a small domestic knock that announced nothing and made the curl womblike in its glass.

“To admire the shape of his cage,” Uddin said with the dry that keeps tears out of a voice. “He thinks he can run better if you watch him. I told him no. He told me a story about what mixed means as if I didn’t come from Bradford with aunties who did more mixing in a kitchen between eight and nine in the morning than he has in a lifetime with his little brush. He won’t be set loose on a room again today. But he will try to get out of the walls by the old route. He wrote stop mixing in his own spit on the interview table and looked pleased with himself like a child who has managed punctuation. We have cloth and disinfectant. For my sins, I have also a file that says two drifts of paint in town overnight, both thin, both on the underside of things. Copycat or apprentice, I cannot tell yet. People like to move in herds when fear is fashionable.”

“You’ll be a shepherd today,” Alfred offered from his chair without looking up. “You were yesterday. This place would rather nibble heather and mind its own knees, but it will come when called if you blow the note right.”

They had decided last night in the hour before tea had found the table that the valley would beat the bounds in daylight with a throat and not just feet. Ruth had finished her liturgy the way women finish knitting when they are pretending only to be counting stitches; it had the roughness of usefulness and a dry hinge of humour where your mind doesn't stumble. She arrived with the papers folded into a hymnbook and three strings of bottle-cap bells around her wrist like bracelets for a saint of salvage. “I’ve written a sentence I’m not sure God will like,” she said to Lyd in the yard where salt had dried into the cracks and made the flags look like an atlas. “It says: we bless what refuses to mind our categories. He can argue with me about it later, I’m busy today.”

“God,” Hazel remarked from the gate, “is not a man who will send you an email about wording. If He is, I’ll be on the wrong committee anyway.”

The hall made a room out of anybody who walked into it. Ellen from the school had put up the maps again, now with four small squares pinned at corners where the old merestones turned with the land and asked knees to remember. The teenagers came wearing jumpers that meant they were part of something and not part of it, the fine wire they walk along. Ryley came, thinner by worry, with his mother who looked as if the kitchen had been a ship and she had been at sea without the usual timetable; she wore a look of hard learning and took the liturgy from Ruth’s hand as if she could spend it. Tom Scarr’s mother came, too, with the kind of statute of a woman who has been stopped and is now moving again in spite of the world. Tom himself slept two streets away under a duvet that had become a pen; phoned men who used to write about rugby were telling each other how the air is not simple when you have had its absence in your mouth.

Outside, the press was learning what happens when a place builds a fence out of women with aprons who are not afraid of a camera. Hazel made tea and put it into hands that offered microphones and the microphones forgot their job for a second. Uddin put a constable in the lane with a face that looked like a cousin and not like the heavier shoes of the state. A man with a too-white smile tried to film the posy on the mantel and Lyd stood in his line of sight until he learned embarrassment, and if embarrassment is not justice it is a useful appetizer. Alfred shook the bottle-cap bells at a child who had been told to stay near and the child laughed and the sound went up to the hall ceiling and sorted dust for a moment.

The walk set off with less theatre than yesterday and more purpose. The air had that light in it that is not light but the promise of it if cloud behaves, and the ground underfoot had learned, too, not to give so much that you felt you were asking a field to oblige you. People tapped stones and said names out loud this time; the old game had been to make the children shout their surname so the valley would learn it, and today they shouted the names of the birds, of the bridges, of each other, because if people around you can call you back by your first name you do less wandering. Where a new thin bar had appeared on a stile under the lip, Uddin got there first with a handkerchief soaked in sea and wiped it away like a mother cleaning a face before a photograph. “Not on our furniture,” she said under her breath to no one and someone. “Not in a colour that doesn’t belong to the wood.”

Edie walked with a stick that had learned the measure of her from years of girls and boys and their borrowed parents. She would not be told to stay behind because behind has never suited her, and twice she thwacked a post that had picked up a stripe overnight as if it had been a naughty child with chalk, and twice she said the word no like a password. Ruth read where the hedges asked her to, and where she thought a hedge might shiver at such old interference she stopped and let the children read instead, and they did it with the kind of seriousness that tells you a line has been laid where one was needed. The valley gathered itself around its stones and looked cheerful with it in a way that fear cannot bear.

He had not been in a cell a day and already he had found a way to conduct a new service. Jerry in custody was a thing that made two systems grind against each other: the neatness of charge sheets and timetables, and the appetite of a man for audiences. He had a pencil when his solicitor came, and though he was prevented from having it when she left, he had had enough time to make neat lines on his paper cup and arrange them into a scale, and when the custody sergeant told him to bin it he smiled and said, “You keep what you like,” and went back to memorising the timetable up on the board the way he had memorised the routes a rat can take through stone. He asked once for chalk, to keep his hands busied; he was given a stress ball that had forgotten its purpose. In the exercise yard he walked the painted track and corrected its corners in his head as if that could make them behave, and he spoke to a lad with a neck tattoo about how hard it is for a man to be asked to live according to other people’s lines. The lad, who had two children and a mother he was afraid of, told him to keep his sermon for someone with time, and Jerry’s smile got thin.

They arraigned him in the afternoon and he tried his charm on the magistrate like a practised key on an old door. The court had that tired municipal smell that never leaves places where chairs are placed to be obeyed, and Lyd stood at the back because Uddin had asked her to come not for theatre but for eyes; the valley does better when its eyes are there. The press had to keep behind a line which is always good for them. Jerry stood and in his standing made a thing of the standing, which is the trick of men who believe in their own outlines. He gave his name as Jeremiah Whit and said it like three separate choices. The clerk read the list, which was unpleasant enough to salt a room. When told he would be remanded he did not make a story of it; he only tilted his head the way you see in a jackdaw, and the room learned he would go quietly when the noise could not be made into music. As he turned his eyes the way a boy who cannot resist a dare will turn them, he caught Lyd’s face and the familiar trick lit under his skin. He mouthed a word and she did not mouth it back, and the word was choose, and she mouthed eat instead and his eyebrows made a small error and the error calmed something in her she had not known could be calmed by the sight of a man losing his place.

Back in the parish, the copies thinned after a day and then flamed in one bad hour down by the ginnel where lads think privacy belongs to anyone who can spit far enough. Ellen caught two with paint on their fingers and took the paint off their fingers and put it onto a stone in a circle that made them more bored than told off. “You want colour, you put it where it helps a boot,” she said, and they did, because being useful is a drug if you’ve only ever been told you are noise. Uddin told three grown men that the fines for criminal damage are more than their manicure would like and that being part of a madness is not an alibi. Ruth put a note on the board about mixing, and wrote the words soup and choir and family tree under it and drew lines between them with a felt-tip and put a heart on none of the ends, and someone on the parish page posted a photograph of a Yorkshire pudding and wrote this, and liked their own thing.

In the evening the walk went the way walks do when the second day has more comfort in it than the first. There is a worse thing than the first day of anything; it is the day after, when the world assumes your promise has burnt itself out. The line broke apart in places and reformed without anyone barking orders because bodies that have done something together once do not need to be instructed quite so often. At the big stone that had got called rude by people who had forgotten that masons like a joke, Lyd put her whole palm to its flank and heard in the thick under-sound the little drum of runners’ feet from forty years ago and sixty and one hundred, and she was ashamed for a second at having let a man change what a stone meant in her mouth. She wiped the shame with salt and with fist, and then she laughed because a collie had got in among the bells and had made himself into music.

The second night after the arrest was kinder than it had any right to be, as if the valley had decided that now it was allowed to sleep one at a time. Lyd slept the way a woman sleeps when there is rope coiled and salt dried and a whistle that has somewhere to be, and she woke to a magpie with more opinions than any one bird can carry. In the yard the chalk she had used for misline had blurred with dew; it looked like a memory of a diagram you could not quite reproduce. She thought about wiping it away and thought better, because there is a moment when you do not tidy until the lesson has held for a run.

After breakfast with crumbs they did not apologise for, Uddin came by with a bag that would have been ridiculous if you were not used to the fact that all salvation travels in jam jars round here. She laid them out on the table as if they were photographs of a boy you are trying to match, and she smirked at her own folly in doing so. “Nine,” she said. “Nine since last night we took from under, down and up and in. Bones that Wakefield tells me are pig still, buttons that might have been stolen off Tom’s too, hair that Hazel says might be this and might be that and she won’t say more because she is old-fashioned in exactly the right way. I have a sheet that says Mr Whit cannot be blamed for anything that took a footstep in the last twelve hours because he has been having his dinner in a cell under my responsibility. So the thin stripes—copycat, as I said, or echo. Edie says echo as if that is sensible in a century with chest freezers.”

“Echo,” Edie said when she came later with the tin again and found a spot for it on the table that was not a spot it had had before. “You tidy a spell into the world—don’t make that face at me, call it a habit with decorative intent—and the line sits in the air for a while whether or not the person who drew it’s gone to sit on a bench and sneer. Like the heat from a good oven when you switch it off. After a bit the ghosts eat it. Or hunger eats it. Same thing.”

There was the other job now, the one that had seemed like a joke when Hazel made it into a sentence in the shop doorway and now had to be worked: to overpaint. Not disdain, not scrub and forget, but to layer. Lyd called the children to the yard with paper and Ruth called her choir and Helen from the pub who painted signs because her grandfather had and she was stubborn with nostalgia, and a lad who sprayed bikes in a shed brought his masks because if you are going to paint together you can avoid killing one another with thrift. They made a colour that was not lilac and was not a pretence at moor; it was made from what was in trays and tins and oddments, and it was the colour of someone in a knitting group whose scarf grew too long because she liked the conversation. They called it bruise-water when they needed to be poetic and kettle-steam when they were not. They took it to the marks that could not be salted and to places where the thin copy stripes had aimed for glory, and they painted over in the most arrogant way possible: with children’s drawings of sheep and frogs, with maps of the packhorse road in pencil refined later in bright, with uneven spirals that made three grandmothers snort and then applaud despite themselves.

Hazel took the camera from her cousin the one with the soft hands and a knack for light and she made photographs of each overpainting and put one in the window of the shop each morning with a price that said this is not for sale and a note that said the money is for mountain rescue anyway. The press tried to buy the right to the images and was told to bring scones and a degree of respect, and two did and discovered that their faces looked better when they had pie in them. A lad in a coat that had cost him his dignity in Leeds but made him feel safe on the valley’s edge posted a picture of the rude mason’s stone with its salt handprint and wrote in his swoopy font: new rules, anyone can read them, and that got likes from further afield than was comfortable, and it made a girl in Huddersfield think she might come on the bus next time and stand by the merestone if only to see if she would feel it in her bones.

On the third morning Lyd went to the sea again because the first bottles were half down and because she had promised herself she would not make the sea into a charm you leave to go stale on a shelf. She took Edie with her because Edie glared at motorists in a way that improves roads. They went to Saltburn and then on to Staithes because Edie had an acquaintance there who made pots that looked like they had sea in their bellies, and they bought three with money Ruth had said came from the jar that had been meant for candles and therefore still served light. “Keep them near the door,” Edie said, turning a pot like an apple to see which cheek to bite. “Not because a goblin cannot cross if you put a pot there. Because you, living in your day, will see a pot in the corner of your eye and remember you have sea in your house and not just air and stubbornness.”

At the sea they met a woman with a dog who behaved itself without trying and she told them about her son and how he had gone to university and learned to speak to water in equations and come home to find the river had learnt algebra without his help. They sprinkled a little salt water on their shoes when they left not because they were superstitious but because it made them laugh to behave as if that would do any harm. When they came back to the edge of the moor the air was a different shape and it fit their faces like a cloth laid over bread to rise. Lyd took the pots into the kitchen and put one near the door and one by the lintel and one by the place the collie liked to make his half-and-half threshold bed, and the collie sniffed and accepted the sea as if it were a cousin with a bag of bones.

The first hearing done, the paperwork satisfactory, the jars counted, the paint thinned, there came a day that did what all decent days do after trouble: took up the unglamorous. Lyd walked fence and found where frost had made a liar out of a staple. She untangled baler twine from hawthorn with curses in her head because the thorn had done nothing but grow and be itself and men had insisted it make neat corners. Alfred sorted a drawer that had contained every screwdriver they had ever claimed to own and discovered that two were actually butter knives gone wrong. Hazel took delivery of a new batch of torches and refused to sell one to a man who wanted it for a reason she disliked without knowing why and sold him a length of string in case his better self needed to tie something instead. Nathan slept a full night and woke guilty and then remembered that he had earned the right to wake without his body trying to predict a siren. Ruth wrote notes for Sunday that had no man’s name in them at all and that would possibly cause letters.

Jerry waited, and prisoners are made to learn a kind of waiting that is a craft. He did not paint in his head, for that would be to give the room his favourite activity. He chose instead to itemise. He itemised the other men’s postures and matched them to animals in a menagerie he had once been dragged to as a child and hated. He itemised the ways in which the officers moved and decided which ones he should admire so that admiration could later become a tool. He itemised the rules of the place and corrected them under his breath and thought himself the keeper. When word came that he had two visitors he went out with the eagerness he had trained out of his face long ago and made it into a polite interest. The visitors were a man he owed money to for making introductions and a woman who had intended to be a solicitor once and had become something else because men had told her she’d be a fine secretary. They talked to him through the glass because that was the rule, and he made a point of looking at the woman like she could be useful and at the man like he had called for him, and somewhere down the corridor a constable yawned and thought of her mother’s Sunday. He asked after his brush, as if any civilised country would be small enough to deny a man his tools. He was told no. He asked whether his filings could be arranged by colour, and the woman looked at him and for half a second her face arranged itself in pity, and this enraged him more than any of it.

The formal beating of the bounds took place on a Saturday with weather that had written its very best letters. People came in their boots and in their best shoes because they had not read the note and needed to be convinced by mud. There were sticks, yes, but they were gentle sticks, the kind you tap, not the kind you strike boys with. There were ribbons because children like them and because colour is a thing you hold when a man has tried to claim it for a threat. Ruth read the liturgy in the version she had made herself out of a dozen grandmothers and four psalms and two lads’ jokes. It said: we borrow your lines for memory and we don’t pretend they are walls. It said: this is where we come back to when we get lost, and also this is where we leave from when we go and make fools of ourselves elsewhere. It said: we have sea in pots and salt in pockets and bells on strings and a whistle and a key and a coin and hands, and we will use what we need and then wash it and put it back for the next lot. Alfred rang the bells without making a festival of it, and their sound went into corners and shook useless things down and left useful ones tidy.

At the last stone before the packhorse bridge, a boy asked his father why we beat a thing we love, and the father said, “So it will remember it is ours and we are it,” and the boy said, “That is mixing,” and Lyd, who was near enough to hear, said, “Exactly,” and the father smiled like a man who had not expected to be told by a woman that his child had made sense. At the bridge, candles were lit because people like an action and because wind likes to make that action humiliating and because we all like to do the useless thing that is useful. Hazel looked at her watch and found it was the time she would have taken in the milk and decided to take nothing in for once. Nathan watched the faces and checked them against the list of people who break at a different hour than they think they do, and he saw none of them break today and he liked that. Uddin stood a step back from the noticeboard where the feathers used to sit with pretension and now sat with a note that said if you must leave symbols make them edible, see Hazel.

When it was done, people went to the hall because food is the only moral afterwards. Children drew again on paper but this time the adults drew too because they had been given permission not to be judged for the shapes that came out of their hands. Ellen organised a table of pencils and got in a fight with a teenager about whether pigs’ bones in paint meant the future was rotten or only as rotten as usual and they both enjoyed themselves more than they admitted. Edie, who had thought herself done with school, taught a five-year-old how to draw a merestone with chalk and how to press hard enough to leave a proper mark and then how to rub it out and still keep it in your arm. Ruth took the bit of liturgy that had not made it into the final and put it in her pocket and resolved to leave it there as a reminder that she did not have to be right, only precise. Alfred put his bells away without drama and took a sandwich like a man who had earned the right to not pretend he was not hungry.

Late, when the hall had become a place again instead of an event and the washing up had reached that joyless stage where you pretend plates are in conversation so you can keep your hands in hot water, Lyd walked down to the bridge by herself with the collie doing an affronted trot because he had not been invited and had invited himself. She put a hand on the arch and felt no new jar and no thin line, and under that the heavier line of the water doing its job. She took the coin from her pocket and put it under her tongue and said Jeremiah without malice and the echo did not bring him because he had been put where his name did him no more favours, and she took that as good. She said Tom and Ryley and the names she did not say in public because people pretend not to collect each other’s names like charms, and she felt them sit in her mouth like bread. The collie barked because a rat had imagined itself important, and together they watched the candle stubs fail and then succeed and then fail again because that is what candles do when they are out of their element and still determined.

In Wakefield the custody suite smelt of coffee that had been made from habit and someone’s cologne that had not been properly chosen. Jerry sat on his cot and recited to himself a list of small failures he had seen today: a boy who did not look at his shoes, a woman who did not flinch, a stone that had been touched by sea and not minded, a policeman who had remembered to make a joke as he put on his gloves and therefore made the work harder for men like Jerry. He recited them backwards and then forwards until he felt he had control again, and he did not, and he pressed his thumb into the thin cut there and tasted salt that had travelled inland and scowled because the taste was older than his disapproval. “It won’t last,” he said into his sleeve, not very loud, and a man three doors down turned on his bunk and said, “What won’t? Your hair?” and the laugh that came down the corridor had no respect in it and did the work of two handcuffs.

The next morning the lilac seep made no new marks. It was washing itself back out of crevices and the sheep had taken what they would and left the rest in small neat smears on stone like shawls on chairs. Lyd put the pots of sea where Edie had told her and they became part of the corners, and when she went out to check the gate she found a feather, genuine, not stuck in with malice, lodged where a boy had tied bottle-cap bells to ring when the wind thought to play, and she left it there because not all symbols are theft and some of them are gifts left by creatures with no idea of our games. She went back in and put the kettle on and the water on the hob sang a little before the whistle did, which is how you know you live in a house.

News finished with them because the news likes to go where it can pretend it is the first to have discovered grief, and this valley had been living with grief longer than the news had hands. Hazel stacked the hats again and put the sign that said if you’re in a rush back up because living is a thing to be done at the speed of sauce. Ruth had a funeral and a baptism and reported that both had gone as well as could be expected and that God had been useful and not overbearing, which is all one can ask of Him. Nathan lost a patient and saved one and did the sums that don't add nicely and went to sit on his steps because sometimes you need to look at the lane to remind yourself why you do mathematics at all.

Lyd made a new list on a page of the old guidebook she had taken back from Uddin and been allowed to deface. It said: feed cows. Check wall at Intake where the weather bullies it. Take Edie’s pot to Ruth because the church should have sea same as men. Visit Tom’s mother with eggs because she will not accept help if you call it by its right name. Walk to Black Hagg even though your knees might ask a question. See about the birch sap that Nathan’s friend swears will do Alfred good whether or not Alfred admits it. At the bottom it said: mend. There was no object for the verb, because on days like these the object is the day.

On the way up to Black Hagg she saw a boy on a bike with his chain off and his hands black and his pride terrible, and she stood and held the lamp of her phone and kept her advice to two sentences and he did the rest because he was a boy and boys like to claim their own competence. She walked again and found herself at the old packhorse road where the men once carried cloth like theology and refused to let rain tell them what to do, and she put her hand to a post and felt the memory of a thousand taps and a thousand names and she did not add hers. At the top the wind had got drunk on itself and was making itself a nuisance to stoops, and she laughed into it and it took the laugh and scissored it up and dropped it over Holmfirth where someone looked up from their sink and smiled without knowing why.

Back at the cottage Alfred had laid the whistle down the way you lay down a small trumpet after a concert in a church that has surprised itself with acoustics, and he was asleep in the chair again and looked like a statue that had been given permission to nap. The jar on the mantel had the curl in it still and the paperweight pig had decided to be bored by it, which is a stance Lyd admired. She took up the curl in its glass and she took the coin and the key and the bit of red thread she had not used, and she went out to the yard and made her own little altar of useful things on the bench where she had cut twine and onions and foolishness for years. She did not pray. She said thank you to the day and to the tools, which is not the same thing and sometimes works better. She put the curl back in the jar and the jar back on the mantel and the house shrugged and accepted the mess of things that had been made part of it in a fortnight that had been a year.

Night came back slow and the fog spent itself again in layers as thin as arguments. The valley put the last of the bells away, not to forget but to preserve them; nobody wants to live in the sound every hour. In Wakefield Jeremiah Whit lay on his back and told himself he had not lost, he had paused, and the men near him brought up vivid dreams of their own small gracelessnesses and the goings-on of their own kitchens. On the moor a stone with a rude mason’s signature in the corner sat with salt in its cracks like lace and did not know it had been the eye of a storm. In the church Ruth left the back door unlocked a minute longer than usual because she had forgotten and nothing came in but an honest draught. Hazel put the sign away and put her feet up and then took them down again because the shop had an idea for the morning that involved a jar for coins and no big words, and she is not one to deny any plan that promises coins and kindness.

Later still, when the birds started writing in their small script on the top line of the day, Lyd went to the door because that is what she will always do. The pots caught some of the light and made it look like a foreign coin and she liked it. She could not hear the sea, because she would have had to be mad to pretend she could, but she could hear water in the lane, faithful gossip, and the Rayburn answering someone’s idea from the yard without contempt, and Alfred breathing, and the collie panting through a rabbit that had got away, and her own heart doing its old work. Along the wall, a spider drew lines with a competence that would have pleased any beadle and drawn Jerry mad, and Lyd, because she is herself, watched and did not interfere. The valley had chosen its ditch, which is to say it had refused to have one; it would take all rivers, as it had done quietly for centuries, and if a man wanted to stand in one and pretend that made him a god, he would be dealt with as a man who had gone paddling where he had not been invited, and whose mother had not told him enough about towels.
