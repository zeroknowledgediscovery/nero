The day the river air smelled like warm pennies and cut grass, Art ran routes until the sky took on the color of bruise-ripe plums. He was alone on the practice field behind the middle school, the one with the chalked lines ghosted from spring baseball, the one with gopher holes he knew by heart. You could hear the hum of traffic from Cobb Parkway and, if the wind leaned right, the metallic creak of the Big Chicken’s beak opening and closing. He told himself to plant his foot sooner, to look the ball into his hands, to fall forward when his weight went wrong, and he told himself these things in a voice so strict he almost believed it belonged to Coach Landry. He wore headphones looped around his neck, silent. He was his own noise.

His name was Arthur Price but everyone said Art. He never corrected them, not even when an aunt slurred it into “Ard” around Thanksgiving candied yams. He was eighteen and he did not yet know that people leave whole cities the way birds leave yards: suddenly, as if a page had been flipped in a book he hadn’t checked out. He did know how to move his feet. He knew the timing of a slant, the rhythm of cutting off a curl to make a defender bite air. He knew how to count his steps—one-two-three plant—and turn a lean into acceleration, the simplest magic he had.

“Head up,” Coach Landry would say, two fingers pinching the brim of his hat, eyes the faded blue of gym floor paint. “Run like you’re disappearing.”

Art ran until the light went weak and the mosquitoes came. He didn’t want to go home because home was a cul-de-sac in east Marietta where the street lamp outside their driveway stuttered like it couldn’t make up its mind. The air would be thick as syrup, his mother would be at the kitchen table, pinching the bridge of her nose over a stack of bills or a baking recipe, it switched week by week. Mia, his kid sister, would be in her room drawing dragons that ate shopping malls. Ray—Ray who had come with six months of good intentions and a monster truck, Ray who wasn’t unkind but wasn't his father—would be watching a show about people in Alaska trying not to freeze. There were nights when all those rooms, all those lives, felt like a set someone could strike and move by the end of the hour.

He limped a little when he climbed into his car. His ankle had been a question all summer, an answer he didn’t like. He rolled the window down and listened to the night. The radio gave him a song about someone wanting someone else to stay. He turned it off because want was a heavy thing to be alone with.

The moving truck was already parked across from their driveway when he turned onto Magnolia Glade. The cul-de-sac looked like a cartoon mouth: everyone’s yards and driveways like teeth worn down by the same grind. He cut the engine and watched a minute, his palms still buzzing from the JUGS machine. A woman in a tank top and paint-splattered jeans stood on the neighbor’s porch and squinted at a list, her ponytail sticking out of a baseball cap like it was trying to escape. A girl—no, he corrected himself, not a girl, his age, not a girl—carried a box the size of a microwave and laughed. A laugh you didn’t hear often on their street. It came from the chest and landed in the bushes and stayed there.

She wore a crumpled band T-shirt, sleeves rolled to her shoulders. There was dirt smudged under one eye like a thumbprint, and a thin chain around her neck that flashed when she turned. It took his brain too long to notice the pendant. An anchor. He looked away and then back, like the sky had shifted.

“Art?” His mother’s voice came from the porch, screen door groaning. Denise Price had a softness around her eyes that people mistook for kindness. On good days it was exactly that. “Don’t sit in the car all night. Lord, you and your staring.”

He got out and, without being told, he crossed to the moving truck.

“You need a hand?” he asked, and said it to the air, because he didn’t know whether to address the woman with the list or the not-a-girl with the anchor. He’d learned long ago to address the air; it was the one between everyone that kept things easy.

The ponytailed woman nodded. “You our neighbor? Blessed be, yes. I’m Nora. This is—”

“Rhea.” The not-a-girl shifted the box higher on her hip, peered at him around it. Her eyes were what people meant when they said green, not the pale kind but the darker shade you find under magnolia leaves. “You can carry the heavy ones since you got the jersey arms.”

He blinked. “I don’t have my jersey on.”

“You don’t need it. The arms keep the secret.” She smiled, and it showed him a front tooth chipped like a thumbnail, the kind of chip you get from living. “Grab those. They’re labeled books but my mom lied.”

“Books is heavy,” Nora said, not looking up from her list. “He knows what he’s in for.”

In the kitchen, Rhea put the box on the counter and wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist. She looked around at the bare walls and the way the light turned yellow at the edges. “We’re painting,” she said to no one, then to Art because he was there. “This is a house that wants to be light blue. Or maybe it’s me who wants it to be. Either way.”

“You’re from where?” He said it because Marietta taught you to ask. People didn’t land here often; they migrated, they were born, they stayed, they fled. “Like, your old place.”

“Norfolk,” she said, and it wasn’t the name but the way she said it, like the word itself held a map he didn’t know how to read. “By the water. You know.” She thumbed the pendant. “Our car still smells like diesel and salt and something that might be dead under the spare tire.”

“My dad’s from Brunswick,” he offered, which was almost the ocean but not. “Well. Used to be. I don’t—he’s—never mind.” The sentence ran out. He was not used to his words wandering out the door without him.

Nora laughed that laugh again and then it softened. “We’ll make do,” she said to the kitchen, to her list, to the moving boxes that had names like BEDROOM 2 and STUFF THAT BREAKS. “We always do, baby.”

They broke down the boxes and the sun went all the way down. They ate slices of pepperoni pizza on the porch steps because there was no table yet, and Art listened to Rhea talk about ships. She said “ships” like other people said “grandmother” or “church.”

“Every time I see one I forget how big they are until they’re right in front of me,” she said. “Like buildings that decided to learn how to float to make a point. They’re their own weather. One minute you think it’s a cloudy day and then a tanker slides past and all the wind changes direction.”

“You travel a lot?” he asked, feeling foolish for asking and unable not to.

“Not yet. Soon.” She made a face. “That’s a lie. I’ve been places. My uncle works on a tug and sometimes I get to ride out when they’re moving a big ship out. The deck is wet, always, and you have to learn that the floor is a different floor. You know?”

He thought of the practice field and how some days the sod gave, some days it held. “Yeah,” he said. “I know.”

When he went home, his mother watched him like you watch a stove when you’re not sure the pilot light is really on.

“Don’t lose your manners,” she said, as if he kept them in his pockets with loose change. “And don’t try to carry everything for them. Let people do their own.”

“I know,” he said. “They’re from Norfolk.”

“That ain’t their fault,” she muttered, which was one of her jokes that weren’t jokes and he didn’t laugh.

Later, lying in bed, the ceiling fan chop-chop-chop making a breeze of rough paper, he unpacked the day like a box he wasn’t sure he wanted to open. He found the way Rhea had stood in the kitchen like a person who’d already made peace with the room. He found her laughter — a shape you could draw if you had the right pencil. He found he’d looked at the anchor and thought not of sinking but of being held to a place long enough to catch his breath. It scared him, that thought. The last person who’d promised to stay had walked out with a seabag and the patience of a saint and just kept going. Art had been ten and had stood in the driveway until the mosquitoes found him, until Denise had dragged him inside and closed the blinds like the dark could cure anything.

It was two weeks before he saw Rhea again, really saw her. The rest of the city was damp with late summer thunder but the air cooled for kickoff. Coach Landry made a speech about discipline that got tangled with something about cowboys and he lost the thread, or maybe Art did. The visiting team warmed up with swagger like they were at a pep rally. It was only a scrimmage. It counted only in the way everything counted when a man in khaki pants watched with a clipboard and didn’t smile.

“You gonna show out or nah?” Deon asked, bouncing on the balls of his feet. Deon had a grin that could vault a fence; he was the kind of running back you couldn’t catch clean. “My auntie’s here. She came for you. Don’t embarrass both of us.”

“I don’t show out,” Art said. “I execute.”

“Execute what, my patience?” Deon laughed and thumped his helmet. “Boy, I swear you talk like a sermon.”

Harley, their quarterback, took a knee near the water coolers and looked like a magazine ad for someone else’s life. He had the helmet-hair hand sweep down. College letters in his bag. A father who shook coaches’ hands with both of his. Art liked him because he threw to whoever was open and that summer Art had been open more often than not.

“You good?” Harley asked, squinting at the evening. “You look like you ate a nail.”

“I’m good,” Art said. He wasn’t lying.

He checked the stands. He always did even when no one came for him. Denise didn’t like the way the bleachers made her back feel. Ray came once, drank a Coke too fast, shouted at a ref who couldn’t hear him, didn’t come again. Mia tried to draw the plays, her pencil making little Xs and Os and arrows like she could make sense of it all if she only kept drawing.

Halfway up, between two fat men in camo hats and a girl with a baby on her hip who kept bouncing in place because you had to, he saw her. No hat. Hair in a knot that looked like it might not hold. Rhea wore a hoodie tied around her waist, as if the night would eventually remember to be cold. She was talking to the girl with the baby, and the baby laughed and spat out its pacifier and Rhea caught it like it was a wide-open post.

The national anthem was sung by a junior with braces who hit every note like it owed her money. The coin flip looked like a ritual that no one believed in. The game began.

Art lined up wide, flattened his lungs, set his eyes to the place he needed to be three seconds from now. The first ball came easy, a slant that rolled off Harley’s fingers like it had been greased. The world made sense when it was a ball and a route and two hands. He caught it, took the hit, turned it into six yards and a memory that stuck in the collarbone. The second ball was harder, a curl that turned into a comeback when the cornerback bit. He stopped. The world kept going. The ball hit him dead in the numbers and he tucked it the way Coach told him to tuck anything you want to keep.

When he went back to the huddle, Deon bumped his shoulder. “You showin’ out,” he said, pleased. “Don’t lie.”

“Execute,” Art said, and realized that the difference didn’t matter.

During a timeout he looked at the stands again. Rhea had moved. She was two rows down now, closer. Her face was turned to the field, but every so often she watched the sky like the weather had a secret it was trying to tell her. He wanted to wave and knew that would be stupid and pictured himself doing it anyway. He adjusted his gloves and shook it off. Boys with hopes did stupid things and got laughed at. Men with hopes did stupid things and called it fate, which was worse.

At halftime, Coach Landry squeezed their shoulders in a way that was affection and a warning. He said they were sloppy in the red zone. He said the defense needed to wrap up. He looked at Art and lifted his chin to the ceiling in a gesture that meant, More, and also, Less. “Your feet,” he said, as if he’d been inside of them. “When you cut, cut. Stop trying to sneak.”

He ate two orange slices like they could save him. Deon moaned about cramps. Harley hummed a song about losing everything and Art wanted to tell him to pick a different one.

Once, when he was ten, he’d stood on the beach at Jekyll Island and watched a shrimp boat come in at dawn, the sun making the nets look like lace. His father’s hand had been heavy on the back of his neck. “You sit long enough, you see the water breathe,” his father had said, which was one of those things older men said where it sounded like wisdom or a way to avoid saying what needed to be said. It took Art years to realize that the thing that needed to be said was always the same: I am going, and I don’t know how to stop. The tide was in that day, licking at the pilings. When he closed his eyes now, before third quarter, he could still feel the grit of sand where it got between his toes and his sock. That grit felt like a promise, like staying. He wiped it away then; he wiped it away again, sixteen different ways.

The moment came late in the third. They had the ball at the forty-eight. Second and long because Deon decided to test whether two linebackers could occupy the same space and lost. The corners had been pressing. They’d been anticipating the slant, sitting on it like a joke they were tired of hearing. Harley caught his eye. Art nodded. The call was a post. He set up like a slant and then broke it like a habit. The corner bit. The safety took a bad angle because his feet were honest and he believed what they told him. Art ran, and the field opened like a door someone had forgotten to lock. The ball came like something he’d been born to find. He did not think. He did not count. He did one thing: he fell forward.

The stadium noise pitched up, and somewhere in the rise of it he heard a singular sound, thin but sure, like the whistle on a kettle in another room. It cut through the rest. A cheer that was one person’s. He smiled despite himself and it ruined the face he tried to keep, that serious mask he wore like equipment.

After, sweaty and salt-brined the way you get even inland, he walked the line of the fence where hands reached out, where old men gave large, papery palms and children looked up and knew that being tall wasn’t enough, you had to be something else too. He signed a program because the cousin of a defensive end had a Sharpie and shrugged in a way that made him feel both invisible and famous. He saw Rhea leaning her elbows on the chainlink, her anchor catching the stadium lights and flashing like an emergency.

“You run like you’re not even here,” she said. “How do you do that?”

He wiped his face with a towel, which only moved the sweat around. “Practice,” he said. “You know.”

“I do. When you practice leaving, does it make staying harder?”

He laughed because he didn’t have another sound ready. “You paint your kitchen yet?”

“We bought three samples. They all looked like toothpaste once they went on the wall.” She made a face like toothpaste was a personal failing. “You were good.”

“We were good,” he said, because he’d learned to be plural when it counted.

“Sure,” she said, not unkind. “We is nice. But you is faster.”

He told her goodnight before the words tried to ask more of him. He wanted to say her name and didn’t want to give it the kind of weight names had when they were said at fences and Fridays and sweat. He backed out of the moment before he tripped.

At home, Denise was half-asleep on the couch, a blanket of mail covering her shins. “Good game?” she mumbled, no question mark necessary.

“Yeah,” he said. “We executed.”

She opened one eye. “That a new word they teach ya’ll.”

“Coach likes it.”

“Coach also likes yelling at boys until his colon puckers,” she said, and then she snored.

He made a sandwich that broke in the middle and dripped mustard on his shirt. He ate it anyway. Mia came out of her room with one earbud in and a drawing the size of the coffee table. “It’s you,” she said, flipping it around. It was him, sort of. A figure with a football for a head, legs like lightning bolts, a cape that said MAR in block letters because she’d run out of space for -IETTA. Tiny blue circles filled the sky.

“What are those?”

“Eyes.” She looked at him like it was obvious. “Everybody watches when you run.”

“They’re watching the ball,” he said, and she rolled her eyes the way only a thirteen-year-old can roll them, like the insides of up there were much better than what was down here.

Two days later he saw the U-Haul again, smaller this time, only a trailer with a painting ladder tied with a rope that looked like it wanted to slip. The morning had gone gray and the humidity had gone somewhere else for an hour and everyone went outside because of it, neighbors in T-shirts talking about things they couldn’t fix: taxes, moss, knees. He leaned on the mailbox, a habit he’d picked up from a retired mailman down the street.

Rhea came out and stopped, holding a curtain rod like a spear. “Help me take this inside,” she said, no prelude. “I am going to turn this house into a boat. I mean it. I will find a way.”

He followed her in. The walls were halfway between what they’d been and what they were going to be. That kind of halfway looked sad on faces but you could get away with it if you were drywall. On the floor lay three paint samples. She was right. They all looked like toothpaste. He wanted to laugh and didn’t. It felt cruel to laugh at a person’s hope when it wasn’t all the way out of its box.

“You really from here?” she asked, balancing on a step stool and cursing lightly under her breath as she reached for a bracket.

“Born in Kennestone,” he said. “Blue ceiling, lots of yelling. Maybe that was me later.”

“Your dad around?”

He stood there, his hands on the curtain rod because she’d told him to. “No,” he said, but not in the way that shut the conversation off, more like the way that opened it up. “He is somewhere. There’s a city where he opens doors and someone says his name. But not here.”

“I get that.” She thumped the bracket with the hammered end of a screwdriver. “Mine is a foghorn in one place and a crossword puzzle in another, and sometimes a voice down a hallway. On a boat, you learn to do without anyone finishing a sentence.”

“What do you want to do?” He wasn’t sure where the question came from, only that it was shaped like him.

Rhea climbed down and tilted her head at him like a bird. It made her look younger for one second and then older the next. “This is going to sound dumb,” she said and he shook his head, not allowing dumb because he wanted to hear it. “I want to go.” She made a gesture like a wing. “With ships. Doesn’t have to be forever. Just enough. Deckhand, cook, scrubber, science person—hell, I’ll be the one who cleans up the coffee machine after it spews. I’ll do anything as long as the floor moves in a way that says it could drop out from under me and I’ll still be fine.”

“Don’t you get… scared?” he asked. The sentence had taken the scenic route, but it got there.

“I’m scared when I don’t try.” She looked at the anchor and then away. “It’s like the trying pulls the fear out and lets it sit somewhere across the room. It’s still there. I just don’t have to hold it.”

He thought about the field. About how the fear sat on the bench and watched him run, sometimes it yelled, sometimes it was quiet, but either way he had to pretend he didn’t hear. “My coach says to run like you’re disappearing.”

“Well.” She grinned. “Maybe you run like you’re appearing to you. Have you tried that?”

He shook his head, because the words were new and he didn’t want to nod at them yet like he understood. After they hung the curtains, they sat on the floor and ate the rest of a bag of corn chips. She drank from a glass with a crack in it that spidered up from the base.

“What if it breaks?” he asked.

“It hasn’t yet,” she said.

He texted her that night because she’d given him her number written on the back of a paint sample card—SALT SEAFOAM—and said, Just in case. He didn’t know what occasion justified it. So he sent a picture of the sunset over the practice field, which looked like it had been poured out of a syrup bottle: slow, bright, thick. His thumb hovered over the message box too long and then he typed: This is home, sometimes.

She sent back a picture of a picture, a photograph tacked to a corkboard—the kind that get faded at the edges. It showed three people in orange vests on a boat too small. The sky was rough. It reminded him that sky moves, too. Her caption: Mine moves.

He didn’t sleep right for three days. He wouldn’t have called it love—it was a word like a high shelf, out of reach, in a room you didn’t know you owned—but there was an ache that liked to hide behind his ribs and that ache had eyes and a mouth and hair in a knot that might not hold, and it was not going to be ignored.

Denise watched him the way you watch a pot you worry might boil over and make a mess at exactly the wrong time. “The scouts are coming,” she said, as if the sentence was a threat and a promise. “Your cousin says that boy from Valdosta got a look from Florida State. If they can look that far behind them, they can look north too. Keep your head.”

“I know,” he said, and he did know. The twenty-seven letters from places that had said we’re interested and meant we’re interested if you are the piece we don’t have yet, if you behave, if nothing better comes along, if you stay fast, if your body doesn’t betray you. Paper weather. Paper boats.

He went with Rhea to the Marietta Square on a Sunday when a craft fair had colonized the lawn. People sold candles that smelled like words—Hearth, Lumber, First Snow. Art sniffed them and thought, they smell like trying to cover a smell. He bought a lemonade so sour it made him blink. Rhea tried on a hat she didn’t buy. They sat on a bench and watched a woman sell birdhouses shaped like cathedrals.

Rhea pointed at the fountain. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “That little angel with its tiny fish. It looks like it knows something filthy.”

“You always talk like that?”

“Like what?”

“Like everything is part of a joke only you’re telling yourself.”

She thought about it, really thought. “I used to talk like everything would save me if I said it loud enough. Now I just—” she shrugged. “I talk. Maybe it saves me anyway.”

He wanted to ask what it would be like to be on a ship when a storm came in, to watch the water pretend it had teeth, to feel small enough to be honest. He wanted to ask why she’d moved to his street, if she picked it or it picked her. He wanted to ask whether her laugh was something she practiced or if it came out like that, unapproved. He asked her instead if she wanted a funnel cake.

They ate it with powdered sugar settling on their wrists like new dust. She got some on her lip and didn’t notice. He noticed and didn’t say anything and then noticed he hadn’t and still didn’t say. The sun slid across the square. A man juggled bowling pins. Someone played a fiddle that sounded like a fight between friends. The whole day felt like it could be held in two hands if you didn’t turn them over too fast.

At home that night, Denise tucked a strand of hair behind her ears that didn’t need tucking and said, “She nice?”

“Yes,” he said, and knew he’d been found out even though he didn’t know he was hiding.

“Is she trouble?” Denise asked, putting an onion on the cutting board like she was laying down a card that would beat whatever Art held. “The kind you want.”

“I don’t know.” It was true. It was also what people said when they refused to say the truth they were learning in real time.

“She got that anchor,” Denise said, and then made a face at herself, like she was being ridiculous. “Never mind. I got no room to talk about picks we wear around our necks.”

“Mom,” he said, and the word in his mouth was both plea and gratitude. She patted his cheek like he’d given her something to hold and then let him go.

Practice during the week was a long strip of sweat and grass stains. Art’s ankle tugged the way a kite string tugs, only when he wasn’t looking at it. He iced it in the training room and tried not to listen to the way Harley flirted with the stat girl. He thought of Rhea painting her kitchen the wrong colors on purpose, just to see, and he smiled into his compression sleeve and Deon caught him.

“You in love?” Deon said in a voice for teasing, which was also a voice for taking inventory.

“Eat it,” Art said, and shoved him with his good shoulder. “Not everything’s about—”

“It’s always about,” Deon sang, turning the word into a chorus.

That Friday the sky broke open and rain fell like it had been promised to someone else and they were getting the overflow. The field turned to soup. Coach Landry told them to tighten their cleats and their hearts. The game was the kind where you realized football had been invented by people who didn’t mind getting their hands inside a rib cage just to see how things worked. Art slipped, caught himself, slipped again. He caught three passes that felt like lifting a couch. He dropped one that hit him in the monstrous bone between sternum and stomach. It hurt and it embarrassed him and he got up faster because of it.

In the stands, no one sat. There were no umbrellas the size they needed. Rhea wore a raincoat the color of traffic cones. Her hair flattened to her skull in a way that made her look mean and he liked it. When he made a mistake, he could feel her not looking away.

On the way out, he stopped under the aluminum overhang and wrung his shirt. Rhea treaded water on the edge of the puddles. “You drowned?” she asked.

“Almost,” he said. “Came back to tell you about it.”

“Tell me later,” she said. “I’m freezing.”

Denise’s car smelled like french fries and damp towels. She handed him an old blanket and frowned at the state of his socks like they’d personally betrayed her. “I’ll wash,” she muttered. “What would ya’ll do if I fell over. Run around naked? Lord.”

He didn’t tell her that Rhea had texted him from the parking lot: Come over? Painting emergency. He didn’t tell her because he wasn’t sure if he would go. The line between good decisions and the other kind was slipperier than the field had been. He went home and showered until he could feel his skin again. He stared at his phone until the word emergency started to look like a made-up word. He grabbed his keys and left, telling himself he would go look, just look.

The kitchen smelled like wet paint and lemons in a box. Rhea had blue on her cheek. The wall was no longer toothpaste; it was something soft that he couldn’t name without sounding like someone he wasn’t. She had pulled the refrigerator away from the wall and there was a patch of ancient grape jelly behind it that made a statement about the people who’d lived here before all of them.

“There,” she said, pointing to a streak. “Look. This is what happens when you forget which hand you are.”

He laughed, and it felt like letting out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding since August. “Your emergency is streaks?”

“My emergency is I’ve been painting since noon and suddenly this room feels like a ship and I made the floor tip and I want to stand up straight.” She gestured with the brush. “Help me.”

He did. He cut in at the corners because he had hands good at catching hard things. He held the ladder when she climbed to do the top because she had hands good at letting go. They didn’t talk for a while, and the silence between them set like plaster.

“Tell me a terrible thing,” she said finally.

He blinked blue out of his eyelashes. “Why?”

“Because we’ll tell each other good ones otherwise. Because the terrible ones stick. Because it’s like flipping a coin and calling heads when you know it’ll be heads. The odds want your honesty.”

He thought of his father’s bag. Of Denise’s fingers pressed to her own forehead. Of the nights the neighborhood kids rode bikes until the streetlight blinked twice and what it did to your stomach when you saw your shadow and had no idea how it got so long. “I hate waking up before there’s light,” he said, simply. “It feels like I’m not supposed to be here yet.”

Rhea’s brush paused. “I hate leaving during the light,” she said, as if this had been a conversation across time they’d finally had in the same room. “It feels like I am supposed to be here still.”

He wanted to ask her not to go anywhere ever, and the want moved through him like weather, quick and full of static. It passed. He cleaned the brushes in their sink. The water ran blue until it ran clear.

After, they stood in the empty room and the walls dried without their permission. He looked at her, at the anchor, at the paint in her hair. He felt like he was falling forward, no ball, no field, just a motion some part of him trusted.

“Thank you,” she said, and took a step back like he might need more room than he knew to stand in.

He texted her when he got home that the kitchen looked like it belonged to people who knew someone who loved them. She texted back a picture of a bowl with lemons, like a invitation to make something of the rest of it.

The nights got shorter. They always do even if the moon pretends to stay the same size. School began with its assurance that there would be bells whether you listened or not. Art moved from class to class in a body that felt not entirely his, like the school had assigned him one and forgot to take it back. People said Good game, man, without looking up from their phones. A girl he’d kissed once at a party nodded at him like she’d seen him in a dream she’d already forgotten. He took notes to the drone of a teacher explaining an economic system shaped like pancakes. He drew route trees in the margins and understood exactly what they meant but couldn’t tell you why they made his chest feel better.

He and Rhea began to measure time in porch-sits. Ten minutes here after dinner, ten minutes there before the sky got coin-silver. Her mother worked late at a clinic and came home in scrubs that had absorbed the day in ways you couldn’t see. She would wave from the car and go inside and then come back with iced tea no matter what month it was. Sometimes Rhea would unspool stories about places where water met steel and refuses to be polite about it. Sometimes she would point out the way the neighbor’s oak leaned like a person who’d had enough and wanted a nap right there in the middle of everything. Sometimes they would not talk at all and the cicadas would take the space because they had more to say than either of them, and what they had to say was only this: we are here, then we are not, and in the middle there is a sound.

One night, he asked her what she wanted besides leaving. It was an ugly question because it made the wanting sound like a wrong. He asked it anyway because ugly things sometimes give you something worth keeping.

“I want to find something I can carry,” she said, and it took him a second to realize she meant the opposite of an anchor. “Something light. Like a song that isn’t heavy. Like a coat that isn’t wet.”

He nodded, pretending to understand. He didn’t, not yet, but he understood the gesture, the reach.

He dreamed of water after that. Not in a scary way, not the drowning dream. In his dream he was running and the field turned to river and he kept running and his cleats didn’t sink, they just got wet, and he was fine, he was better than fine, he was most himself, and the ball was a sun he carried under his arm and the sun did not burn him.

He woke up and the idea of finishing a sentence without being interrupted by the future felt possible and he rolled his ankle and grimaced and cursed and then laughed. Mia, walking past his door with a bowl of cereal, stuck her head in. “Injury report?” she asked.

“Probable,” he said.

She nodded, satisfied. “Mom says fix the porch light when you stop being a hero.”

He fixed it because if you left a thing broken in their house it became a family member with needs no one could tolerate. On the ladder he could see more of the street. He’d never looked down on it from this angle. It made everyone seem kinder, somehow. Rhea’s house looked like a painting of a house. He waved, reflex, and then laughed at himself because she wasn’t even outside. When he came down, she was on the curb, tying her shoe, like she had felt it. She waved, not reflex, like everything she did was a decision.

“Want to see something?” she asked, and that was how he found himself in a thrift store on the edge of town, down where the road turned to a kind of road that led you to places you don’t tell your mother about. The store smelled like old coats. It had a bin labeled Misc and another labeled Less Misc and he could have cried from how precise that was.

Rhea went straight to the back and rummaged like she had a metal detector in her hands. She dug up a Polaroid camera and rattled it like a doctor checking a knee. The clerk looked up from her crosswords long enough to say, “It works if you pray at it,” and went back to the grid.

They took pictures the way people take medicine when they don’t know what else might help. The first one came out too light. The second caught Art mid-blink. The third made it look like they were in a different decade, which was what Polaroids often did to the truth to make it easier to set on a shelf. They stuck one on the dashboard with a piece of gum until it gave up.

On the drive home, the sky stacked itself with clouds that had bodies. “Thunderheads,” Rhea said, running her finger along the horizon without touching it. “They look like inventions.”

“Why you know clouds?” he asked, part-tease, part-curiosity.

“Because they tell you how much time you have.”

He wanted to say: how much time for what, and chose not to. These were the kinds of questions that took you to the dock with a duffel bag in your hand.

Back on Magnolia Glade, a little kid across the circle fell off his bike. He howled and then stopped when he saw them see him, pride kicking grief out of his throat. Rhea went over and checked his knee like a field medic. “It will bleed,” she informed him gravely. “Do not be impressed. Blood is lazy.”

He blinked and swallowed his tears and then let one out anyway, because sometimes the thing you’re told not to do insists. Art felt something in his chest he didn’t have a category for yet. It felt like luck. It felt like dread.

That night, in the old hours where the day loses its edges, he stood at his window. The streetlights made circles you could stand inside and pretend you’d been chosen. Rhea’s house had one light on in the kitchen. He could see them moving inside, two shadows. He wondered if they ever watched him back, and if they did, whether they would admit it. He wondered if it mattered.

He pressed his forehead against the glass and made it fog. He drew a shape in it and wiped it away before he could name it.September arrived like a person who forgot to knock and then stood there anyway, damp at the edges, unapologetic. The mornings had that thin kind of chill that made your forearms look at each other and agree to grow goosebumps, but by third period the heat returned sheepish and stubborn like a dog that didn’t understand why you’d closed the back door. In homeroom, they handed out forms in colors that felt designed to discipline a person into adulthood. Art filled in boxes and didn’t write his father’s name anywhere because there was never a box that made sense for it. Ms. Faircloth, the guidance counselor who wore shoes that whispered down the hallway and necklaces made of beads the size of olives, called him in and sat him down across from a file that had his life in it reduced to paper and staples.

“I watched your film,” she said, like a confession. “You’ve got good hands and a way of not making a mess when you catch in traffic. That’s rare. A lot of boys treat it like whack-a-mole. You don’t.”

“Thank you,” he said, because he didn’t know what else to say to a woman who collected futures and handed out acceptable versions of them.

She slid a folder across the desk and it hit his forearm like a small, polite knock. “Applications are their own sport,” she said. “Deadlines, essays, the performance of sincerity. Think of it like a playbook. Everything is a page you call at the right time. When you write your personal statement, don’t write about wanting to get out. Everyone writes that. Write about something you know no one else knows how to say.”

He wanted to say he didn’t want to get out; he wanted to not be left, which was not the same thing, and also wasn’t something you wrote down because it sounded like a complaint you weren’t supposed to have. He looked at the list of schools: places he’d said out loud only as part of a game with Deon where they named the prettiest uniforms and argued about helmets like they were destiny. He saw Georgia, he saw Tech, he saw places farther that he had never visited except on a map, and he thought about his ankle as a yes-no coin he kept flipping under a table. He nodded because nodding kept people moving.

“Your mother will want to see this,” Ms. Faircloth said, with the certainty of a person who believed mothers wanted to see everything. “And, Arthur—”

“Art,” he corrected, without thinking, and then blinked at the sound of it, like he had caught his own name badly.

“Art.” She said it as if she was tasting something she’d never had. “Allow yourself to be happy sometimes when things are good. You can do more than one feeling at a time. You don’t have to pick.”

He carried the folder through the halls like a thing that would break if he looked away from it. In the cafeteria, the noise rose and fell like weather. Harley held court with a yogurt and two bagels, lecturing the table on the art of audible calls as if he had invented adult decision-making. Deon told a story about his cousin’s tattoo that nobody believed but everyone enjoyed. Art ate chicken nuggets in a pattern—dip, bite, dip, bite—as if he could create order by doing a small thing over and over in a way that brought an agreeable end. When he set the folder down, it was like announcing a birth.

“What’s that,” Deon asked, reaching as if he might open it without permission purely to test gravity.

“Homework,” Art said, and pretended to protect it like a person in a bank commercial protects a suitcase full of their child’s future happiness.

After school, Rhea was waiting by the fence with a donut in a paper bag. She held it out like a challenge and a reward. “I tried to save the good one for you,” she said, and smiled without apology for the bite mark in the corner. “It was a fight.”

He tore it in half carefully, as if he were responsible for its dignity. He tasted cinnamon and grease and an idea of apple. He licked a smear off his thumb and pretended that was the only time he would consider kissing something in public. She looked past him to the practice field where boys in white and blue were replicating pain for the sake of a future audience.

“You want to see something?” she asked, repeating herself on purpose like a person who believes the repetition is part of the incantation.

He had a study hall he never used to study and a promise to help Ray move a toolbox from the garage to the truck and a head full of sentences he had to write for people to judge and he said, “Yes,” before he could tell himself a different story.

They drove to the river that wasn’t a river and wouldn’t introduce itself as such. The Chattahoochee slid by like a secret that had already been told. At Cochran Shoals the leaves had begun to decide. The trail smelled like wet stone and someone else’s dog. They walked until the traffic on the other side of the water sounded like a faraway party they weren’t invited to and then stopped on a flat rock that had belonged to someone before them and would after.

“That way is Atlanta,” Rhea said, pointing somewhere the trees wouldn’t let him see. “That way is a place that pretends to be more south than it needs to be. That way is where it all falls apart and then meets again and then goes right under a little steel bridge with rust that looks like it might be the same color as good luck.”

He leaned back on his hands and pretended not to watch her as she watched the water. When she talked about what she loved, her voice shed a layer he hadn’t known she wore. She took the Polaroid out of her backpack and shook it like a traditionalist even though she’d been told by the clerk it wasn’t necessary. The picture came like a slow secret. It was of nothing much: water, trees, a sliver of his jaw, a leaf shaped like a broad hand. He liked that it looked older than they were.

“When the tide turns, you feel it,” she said, although this was a river that didn’t care about the moon’s suggestion. “People think water is soft. It isn’t. You ever push against it? Really push? It pushes back. It lets you know.” She ran her finger along the squint of current like she could take its temperature. “When I go, I’m going to keep a little square of whatever this is in my pocket, just so I don’t get stupid and think the ocean is the only thing that counts because it has bigger teeth.”

“You going when,” he asked, and he heard the way his voice borrowed steel from somewhere without asking permission.

“Soon if I can. I applied to a program on a tall ship out of Charleston. They take girls like me and give us rope burn and show us how to make knots that hold. They teach us how to listen.” She didn’t look at him when she said it. She looked at a stick that had failed to be a log. “It’s for a month. Maybe two if I don’t fall off the side or get in a fight with a gull.”

He watched a pair of joggers trudge past, breath loud and honest. He wondered if he could miss a person for a month he hadn’t known for more than a summer and decided he could because the math on missing didn’t obey units of time so much as the speed at which a person lodged themselves in the space between your ribs. He wanted to say: do not go, or if you go, leave something I can hold, but what came out was, “Where’s Charleston.”

“East,” she said, and grinned, because she knew he knew. “Far enough that if we both throw a rock, mine lands in a different kind of water.”

When he got home, Ray was in the driveway with the hood up on the monster truck like he was performing open-heart surgery without a medical license. There was a line of grease across his forehead that wasn’t a stripe so much as a decision to make his face look like it had done something useful. He looked up at Art and his expression did a thing Art recognized as a man hoping to be read as more than he appeared, which was a look he assigned to himself when he lifted a weight he could already lift.

“You got a second?” Ray asked, knuckles shining with worked-in oil. “I can’t get this clamp off. The manual says it’s an easy removal, which is code for this thing is married to the engine and they’re never getting divorced.”

Art turned his hat backward and reached in with a wrench. They were close for a moment in the kind of proximity where you smell a person’s soap and decide whether they know their own mind. Ray defaulted to kindness in a way that felt like resignation. He wasn’t Denise’s chosen, maybe he had been chosen by peace, which was a different skill.

“You played good last week,” Ray said into the engine, the statement turning into an elbow of sound. “You looked fast. I told the guy at the auto place you were mine, which is not exactly true but also not a lie, you know?”

Art tightened, loosened, tightened again. “Yeah,” he said, which covered more than one thing and used less than one word for it.

Ray eased the clamp free and held it up like a trophy smaller than the category promised. “I might be gone some weekends coming up,” he said, moving his body as if the words came out of his shoulder and not his mouth. “Got a job hauling down in Macon. Pays right. I’ll be back Sundays. Maybe Mondays. Depends who I’m hauling for. I figured your mama would tell you but you know how sometimes she don’t say a thing until it’s done.”

Art understood that as instruction to carry this information in a way that wouldn’t make the whole house fall over. He nodded and heard his brain whispering a different thing: they always go in ways that make sense to them.

That Thursday in practice the gopher holes worked on their own playbook. He planted on a five-yard out and felt the ground forget it was under him. The pain was quick and high and hot, the kind that made his stomach object, the kind that used the word pop without shouting it. He went a minute floating on the edge of himself and then came back to the huddle with a smile he’d learned from television, the one that said everything is fine and possibly even better than fine, don’t waste money worrying. Deon looked at him longer than the play warranted and nudged him with a kindness disguised as rudeness.

“What, you a horse now? We gonna shoot you behind the shed?” Deon grinned so big it was a flag. “Wrap that mess and go.”

He wrapped it. Bryce, the trainer who had a face like a small-town pastor and hands that knew exactly where pain hid, taped him up in a way that made him think of gifts you give to people you aren’t sure will like you for them. Bryce said, “If you were my son, I’d sit you,” in a voice that wasn’t a dare. Art said, “I’m not,” and they both pretended that wasn’t hilarious in a way that would make them both cry if they looked at it too long.

The next day, the men in khaki came with their clipboards like an invading species that learned to camouflage by wearing an entire golf course as a uniform. Coach Landry perfected his walk-away-that-looks-like-a-welcome. He sent them to the bleachers with nods that stood in for promises he had not signed his name to. He pulled the team into a huddle and held them there for a second longer than he had to, as if he could set their molecules by standing near them and frowning.

“You’re not a tryout for other men’s jobs,” he said, which wasn’t true but felt better than true. “You’re us. Play like you’re not explaining it to anyone.”

Art caught the first slant clean and ran out of bounds on purpose because his ankle could either be told what to do or it would do it louder. On the second drive he took contact and his bones debated justice in a way that made his eyes water. He felt Rhea in the stands like a light he could find with his skin even if he didn’t look up to see if she was there. Denise had stayed home because Mia had a fever that was pretending to be worse than it was to get cartoons.

Mid-second quarter, Harley read a blitz and the read was wrong. The ball went high because Harley’s shoulders remembered a hit before it happened, and Art stretched a different way than he meant to. When he came down, the ground wasn’t where he’d left it. The ankle rolled in a lazy way like it wasn’t attached. He heard something more than felt it, and the sound lived behind his teeth for a second and then in his palms. He didn’t lie down. He refused something as old as himself. He hopped off and waved off Bryce as if Bryce’s job didn’t exist and Bryce said, “Boy,” in a voice that filed a petition with the world for better sense.

He jogged the length of the field to trick his body into believing a lie he needed. At the forty he had to stop. Everything that held him up asked him why they were doing this. The people in khaki didn’t look up from their clipboards because they had learned not to watch the moment so much as wait for the statistics. When he finally sat, the cool of the bench felt punitive. Coach Landry knelt in front of him like a man proposing and squinted at the tape.

“We need you,” Coach said, which is the kind of thing men say to boys and mean it and don’t. “We don’t need you tonight if it means we don’t have you later. You hear me.”

He nodded because it was required. He looked up to find one thing that wasn’t asking anything of him, and he found Rhea’s face in the crowd. She had that set to her mouth he’d seen once when a door stuck and she had decided it wasn’t allowed to. She lifted her hands palm-up in the universal sign for What can I do from here. He lifted his shoulders in the smaller universal that said Nothing, and also Everything just by staying.

After the game, he listened to the cleats on concrete echo like an important sentence said in the wrong room. He showered and strapped and listened to the khaki men give polite advice to Coach about weight rooms and film study as if these were things he didn’t already worship. Deon was quiet in a way that meant he was calculating debts and paying them with his body the next week. Harley put his hand on Art’s helmet and knocked it twice in a gesture he must have learned from a father who liked to be seen loving his son in public.

Outside, under the glare of lights that made everyone look the same kind of tired, Rhea waited with a patience that looked new to her. She put a hand on the chain link and the metal pinged in a way he felt in his teeth. “Tell me you’re okay,” she said, because sometimes you ask a person to tell you a lie you can live with until the morning.

“I will be,” he said, and it was not a lie, not yet.

“I got accepted,” she blurted, and then clapped a hand over her mouth like she could put the words back. “The tall ship. It starts October twentieth. We sail south. They teach us how not to fall in. They teach us how to climb. My mom cried when we read the email and then said maybe she had onion in her eye from thinking about dinner, and I didn’t tell her it wasn’t dinner time and she wasn’t cooking.”

He put his weight on his good foot and felt the other ankle make a note of it for later. He wanted to say a very mature, supportive thing that would make her feel like the wind was behind her. He also wanted to say, Stay. He didn’t say either. He said, “Congratulations,” and his voice found a sincerity he hadn’t designed but was thankful for. “You’re going to be the person they measure the rope with.”

She laughed in a way that bounced off the aluminum and came back to them both. “That doesn’t mean anything,” she said, warm, and he said, “It does,” quiet, and she looked at him like she understood that what he said out loud and what he meant were sometimes good friends holding hands across a crowded room.

Denise waited in the car like a woman who had been presented with the bill before the check came. She watched him limp and didn’t make a face he could nudge into humor. “Get in,” she said, and her voice tried to be gentle and landed on tired concern. At the red light, she took his hand off his knee and put it back on the seat belt. “Don’t hold it like that. It’ll think it won.”

At home, she made him sit with his leg on a stack of cookbooks that turned Better Homes & Gardens into a functional altar. Mia came out with a blanket and a thermometer she didn’t need anymore and a drawing of a ship with footballs for sails. “This is you okay,” she announced, as if she could make it so. “Don’t contradict me.”

Denise stood with her hands on her hips in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room like she worked there. “I’m happy for that girl,” she said, with no lead-in, which was her way. “I am. For real. I like a person who knows when a thing is theirs to try. But if she takes you’s attention into water, I’m going to be mad at both of you in a way that’s ungodly.”

He almost smiled, because Denise believed in God like she believed in coupons: useful if you carry them, easily misplaced. “I won’t let the water have me,” he said, and meant it in a way he hadn’t expected to mean anything that day.

That night he couldn’t sleep for the way his ankle had a heartbeat. He sat on the floor with his application essay open on a laptop that had learned his face when he was thirteen and acne made him look like a constellation. He typed, deleted, typed. He wrote: When I run, I am trying to be where I should be before someone else sees me. He wrote: The first time something left without me, I thought it was my job to chase it. He wrote: The thing I learned from football is that you don’t learn just one thing from football. He wrote: I am not fast only in one direction, and then he laughed and erased that because he stood by the truth but hated the sentence. He wrote: My coach tells me to run like I’m disappearing. I think I’m practicing the opposite.

In the morning, the world arranged itself in its weekend shape. The cul-de-sac gathered men with coffee who liked to stand with one foot on a curb like it belonged to them more if their foot was higher than someone else’s. Someone had a garage sale that was really a junk migration. A small child tried on a baseball glove on the wrong hand and looked offended that no one told him when everything felt strange. Ray left at eight with the monster truck sounding like it was apologizing to the street as it left it. Denise swept the porch like she could keep leaves from finding their way regardless.

Rhea texted a picture of a duffel bag with a hole at the bottom that she’d patched with duct tape and a sticker that said WET PAINT. He sent back a picture of his ankle wrapped like a badly-decorated cake. She replied with a thumbs up and then, after a beat, a small anchor that on the screen looked harmless and in his chest looked like a different kind of symbol entirely.

By Tuesday he was at physical therapy in a room that smelled like clean ambition. Bryce sent him to a woman named Yasmin whose forearms could have been a moral. She showed him how to move without asking the injured part to carry the whole conversation. She said, “You ever see a table with four legs and one gets wobbly,” and he said, “We got one,” and she smiled, sharp. “Strengthen the other three. Don’t throw the table out.” She watched him balance on a pad that made the floor argue with itself and nodded when he wobbled and didn’t fall. “You’re not a hero for being in pain and continuing,” she told him. “Sometimes heroes sit down. Sometimes they learn to stand correctly.”

He took that back to practice and watched boys be mean to themselves in the way boys considered noble. Coach Landry walked by and tossed him a look that was both compliment and assignment. “Your eyes,” Coach said. “Start using them like they can make things happen other than watching.” Art nodded like eyes could be trained out of stupid and made a note to watch film without watching himself fall into his own errors like a person who enjoys them.

One evening, Rhea came over with a mason jar of screws and a hammer she held like a bouquet. Denise let her in and then stood there with her hands on her haunches as if she’d personally invited the problem. Rhea offered to fix the back porch screen that had been losing its argument with the frame since June. Denise watched her work with an expression that could have been appraisal or love or a combination that she didn’t always put on paper. “You sure,” she asked, as if any question could dislodge Rhea from a ladder once she’d stepped on it.

“I like when a thing knows it was wanted,” Rhea said, which made Denise smile despite a day at work that had been louder than it needed to be. Mia sat cross-legged on the floor with a flashlight shining up her face like a ghost telling a story and handed Rhea nails like a scrub nurse offering a scalpel. The three of them made a picture that would have won a contest if the contest had a category named: the exact way a house holds onto its people for one more hour.

When the screen was tight as a new thought, they sat on the steps and drank iced tea because that was what you did when your hands had done something. Denise told a story about the time she chased a man who stole a pack of cigarettes out of the gas station and how she’d flung a can of Pringles at his head with the precision of a person who could have had an entirely different career. Rhea laughed and leaned against the rail and the porch light put a circle on her shoulder like it was trying to claim her.

Later, alone with her, Art tried again to say one thing and ended up saying another in a way that still felt honest. “I keep thinking if I run fast enough I won’t notice anyone going,” he said into the space between their knees and the yard. “But I notice. That isn’t a thing I can outrun.”

“That’s not a thing you should outrun,” she said, gentle as a rule. “You can miss someone and still do you. You can want something and not apologize to the other wanting inside of you. People act like you only get one hunger. That’s not true. You can hold a plate in each hand. You can eat standing up.”

He laughed, surprised by the relief that the laugh carried behind it. “You talk like a sermon sometimes.”

“That’s because I’ve met a lot of preachers at boat blessings,” she said, straight, as if this were just a fact like gravity. “They aren’t all wrong.”

There was a pause that felt engineered by the night. The cicadas kept them both honest by refusing to stop and let them think they owned the silence. He reached for her hand because sometimes you just do the thing the sentence wants. She let him have it and didn’t make a joke. Her fingers were paint-slicked on the cuticles and warm in a way that made him want to pretend he had never been cold.

He kissed her on the porch because there was no inside version of it left to invent. It tasted like iced tea and work, like the moment someone hands you a towel when you didn’t realize you were wet. She kissed him back like she had known this was the plan since the day they moved in and hadn’t wanted to spook it by saying so. When they pulled apart, she looked at his mouth like it had said something important and would again if given a chance.

“Okay,” she said, and it wasn’t triumphant or coy. It was practical, like writing a date on a calendar so you don’t forget to show up to a thing you promised you’d be at.

After she left, he stood at his bedroom window again because boys are predictable and because some angles felt like proof. The kitchen light across the way was off this time. He could see his own reflection and the skinny boy he had been at ten standing there with a mosquito on his ear and a mind that had nothing in it but the sound of a seabag zipper. He almost told that boy, She is going to leave too, and it’s not going to ruin you, and then he decided not to be that person to himself. He pressed his forehead to the glass and wrote the word stay in the fog and then wiped it away before anybody, including future him, could argue with it.

By the next game, he could cut right and not left. Coach adjusted. Deon ran like he could make the earth skip and the earth did its best. Harley threw smart and then stupid and then apologized to anyone who liked him. The khaki men didn’t come because they had to watch someone else be the possibility of the day. Art played as if he were a person who knew what his body could and could not do and still loved it. He caught a pass on the sideline and tapped his toes like a dancer pretending to be a bird and the referee nodded with his whole head. He found Rhea in the stands and she did a small motion with her hand that he decided meant proud even if she was just flicking a bug.

After, they drove to Waffle House because breakfast food after nine is a language. The waitress called him baby and him sugar and her sweetie and her darlin’ and he kept count until he lost it because the words applied and didn’t and he liked the way they were free. They ate hash browns scattered and smothered and whatever else the cook decided to do to them with onion and logic. Rhea put jelly on toast the way a person paints a wall. She told him she’d bought a set of cheap gloves because rope is unkind at first and then unkind later. He told her he’d almost written about her in his essay and then didn’t, and she said, “Good,” and then, warmer, “Save it. Use all that energy for a thing that won’t get graded by a stranger who ate lunch while deciding your fate.”

They sat there past what the clock approved. A man at the counter talked to himself into a coffee cup. A boy in a paper hat dropped a plate and looked like he’d broken the moon. The cook cussed and then apologized to Jesus under his breath and Jesus, if he was there, forgave him, because the eggs were good.

When he dropped her at her house, she sat there a second longer than she needed to and he let the engine idle. “When I’m gone,” she said, finally, her voice trying something new and still brave. “Don’t stop practicing whatever this is. Don’t wait for me to bring the water back to you. Learn to make it yourself. Find a way to move that means you’re still exactly here.”

“I will,” he said, and meant it without knowing how.

He watched her walk up the path, the anchor catching the light one last time like a wink from a light far offshore. He drove home and the Big Chicken’s beak creaked in the distance, a noise he’d heard since he was a kid and never thought about as anything other than the sound of a place promising you that ridiculous things could be permanent if you let them.

That night he dreamed the river had edges, but when he stepped into it, the edges moved, and the movement made room for him. He woke before the alarm and watched the ceiling fan pretend to be a helicopter and thought, maybe that’s it. Maybe the trick isn’t disappearing. Maybe it’s learning which parts of you get to go and which parts stay, and accepting that sometimes the part that stays is the wanting itself. He rolled his ankle gently, listened to it whisper yes-no, yes-no, and then he got up because the day was asking whether he would. He answered by moving, which was the only answer he knew how to give that didn’t require the right words.Chapter Five

The first cool morning was a reminder that Georgia knows how to change its mind. The humidity that had held the city in its palm loosened its grip, and the air slid in thin, the kind that sharpened your skin and made the inside of your nose think of paper. Art woke to the sound of the garbage truck lifting and slamming and thought, for one sleepy second, that the ocean had rolled over and bumped its head against the curb. His ankle had opinions when his foot hit the floor. He flexed it gently and listened as if it might tell him the exact day it would forgive him.

At school, mornings came with breath you could see, boys exhaling clouds that made them look like blessed beasts set in line by a bell. Homeroom turned its predictable pages. Ms. Faircloth’s shoes whispered down hallways. The chain-link around the practice field held the day in its square hands and let the wind through because you can’t fence that. Art walked out with his backpack weighted by a folder of schools that sounded like postcards and a body that felt like a promise he had to keep and couldn’t make yet.

Harley had taped a strip of black across his wrist with JMJ in silver Sharpie like he was on a magazine cover nobody bought in this town but everybody saw. No one asked him who JMJ was; the initials were their own religion. Deon wore socks pulled to his knees and a grin like it was his and he was loaning it to the day. When practice started, the cleats bit into ground that had hardened into something with a memory. Art tested his right foot and then the left like each had reason to lie. Coach Landry watched with his hands in his back pockets, chewing a toothpick as if it told him something about boys that they refused to tell themselves.

“You got two choices,” Coach said when Art jogged past, not stopping him with a hand because the hand wasn’t the important part. “You can be a hero or a player. Heroes get statues and nicks named after them. Players get games. Pick often. Pick with your head.”

Art nodded and felt something in his chest agree without knowing why. He ran routes that had lived in his calves since June, cutting the out, throttling down on the curl, selling the slant with a tilt of his shoulder like a magic trick he had learned to believe. The ankle tugged but didn’t shout. Yasmin at therapy had given him a blue band and a list and told him to respect the part he couldn’t see, told him to trust that stillness is work too, and he’d written those words in his head and underlined them when he laced his cleats.

After practice, the sky went to that late-September purple like it was bruising on purpose. Rhea waited at the fence with her hoodie over her head even though she didn’t need it, even though hoodies in September felt like lying to your own body just to make October feel closer. Her anchor lifted at her throat when she laughed at something a kid with a trumpet was trying and failing to play a hundred yards away. He went to her because he had started to go to her the way you go to water in summer without asking whether you should be thirsty.

“You limp less,” she said, her eyes checking his gait like she had a list and he had to hit the marks. “Either that or you’re better at hiding it. I cannot applaud that, you know.”

“I know,” he said. “I’m not hiding. I’m not showing out either. I’m executing.”

She smirked like she was pleased by the way he said it. “You sound like you’re in the army. Execute this. Execute that. I’m going to get you a stamp.”

“Please don’t.” He leaned his forearms on the fence so he could look at her without looking like he was looking and added, “When do you go.”

“Three weeks and a handful,” she said, the words falling in a neat line that she refused to make sad. “We have a list on the fridge. I’ve crossed off ‘buy gloves’ and ‘call auntie with the cat’ and ‘stop being afraid in a way that takes up the whole car.’ That last one is a lie and I know it. I’m leaving it crossed out because it makes the fridge look different.”

He imagined their refrigerator with its magnets and pictures and the dumb gravity of lists that made life feel like it could be leaned against. He imagined Nora with her ponytail making its escape under a hat, reading the list and adding her own line in loopy penmanship: pay electric, call Donna, buy dish soap, tell Rhea I am proud in a way that scares me. He thought of his own house where the only list was the pile of mail on the kitchen table and the way Denise chewed gum when she did the bills, like she could trick the math with sugar.

He tried not to look up at the stands where the men in khaki had taken to appearing in little clusters like mushrooms. He didn’t want to pack his thoughts in a box and ship them to someone who didn’t want them yet. He tried not to count the days she had left and ended up counting them anyway because numbers were a way to feel like the world had joints you could see.

They walked home the long way, cutting through a side street lined with crepe myrtles that had given up on being pink and decided to be bark. Someone had put a piano on a porch and left it there, its keys exposed, a note written on painter’s tape: Please be kind. Rhea touched one key and then another and set two little sounds in the air like birds you didn’t know you owned. He wanted to kiss her then, in the open, with a yard sign that said someone had a graduate last spring leaning toward them, and he wanted not to because there were children racing scooters around their parents’ ankles and a dachshund with ambitious lungs.

At home, the porch light he had fixed stayed steady like a good man. Ray’s monster truck was gone, which meant he was correctly doing his job somewhere else, and Denise sat with a catalog in her lap circled with rings of iced tea like planets. Mia had white paint on one foot and colored pencils in her hair and was drawing a woman with a ladder for a spine. “It’s Mama,” she announced when Art asked, as if it were unkind that he didn’t already know. “She climbs too much.”

Denise snorted and didn’t disagree. She put the catalog down and said, “You hungry, Rhea. I got spaghetti the right way and spaghetti the wrong way. The wrong way is with hot dogs cut up in it and ketchup because I miscounted tomatoes and made do and no one can judge me.”

“I will try both ways,” Rhea said, and Denise handed her a bowl and watched the way she twirled the fork like you can tell something about a person by the way they commit to noodles. The kitchen smelled like basil and something burning in the oven Mia had sworn wasn’t her fault. The room held the kind of warmth that made you confident about the next ten minutes, if not the next year.

They ate at the table with the wobbly leg, and Art reached under and pressed his knee against the bad corner and kept the whole thing honest in a way that had nothing to do with virtue and everything to do with habit. Dinner, like most evenings, was a conversation that walked around problems and touched them gently because they weren’t guests who needed to be seated. Denise asked Rhea if she knew how to swim, and Rhea said yes and told them the sea teaches you humility even when you’re on a boat, and Mia wanted to know whether sharks felt like cats if you pet them backwards and Denise said do not pet sharks backwards and do not pet any animal backwards unless you like getting bit. Ray called from a gas station in Eastman with a laugh that sounded far away and said the traffic was rude like it had been raised in a house with a TV in every room, and Denise told him to drive like he wasn’t trying to impress anyone, and he said he was already the least impressive person on I-16.

After, on the steps with the dishes washed and stacked like advice, Rhea and Art shared the last of the store-bought lemonade that always promised more than it delivered. He told her about Ms. Faircloth telling him not to write about wanting to get out and she told him about a girl in Norfolk who swore she would marry the harbor and then did, in a way, by working a dock crane and walking around with grease under her nails like a wedding ring. He told her about Yasmin and the blue band and the religion of balance and she told him about a knot she’d been practicing that morning sitting on the carpet up to her ankles in rope.

“What kind of knot,” he asked, because it felt like asking about weather in a way that mattered.

“Bowline,” she said, pleased with the O shape of the word in her mouth. “It makes a loop that won’t slip and won’t jam if you trust it. You can tie it one-handed if you need to. They call it the king of knots. It’s unnecessarily gendered but we can forgive that if it holds.”

He held out his hand like a volunteer and she took a piece of paracord from her hoodie pocket the way a magician produces scarves. She wrapped, tucked, and pulled, and suddenly there was a small sturdy circle around his wrist that looked like it had been born there. He turned his arm and the knot rested against his pulse like it was trying to learn it. He didn’t say anything because sometimes you don’t tell the thing you’re given how much it weighs.

The next Friday brought a team from down near the line where Georgia pretends to be Florida. They ran fast, spoke loud, and wore their socks low as if skin would make them quicker. The bleachers filled with the usual rattle of coolers and opinions. The men in khaki came back with their jogger pants and folded arms and pens held upright like prayer. Dani, the stat girl with glitter on her nails, took up a corner near the scorers’ table and dunked pretzels in nacho cheese that had no relation to anything that had grown on purpose.

Art warmed up with the tape snug around his ankle and the bowline under it like a secret. He watched the defensive back he would see the most, a kid with two barbed wire tattoos that looked like the idea of tough he’d bought at the mall. He watched the safeties roll late like they were lazy and knew they weren’t. He made a deal with himself to take what the field gave him and not demand the thing he thought he was owed.

When the ball came, it came the way it does when you stop thinking you have to arrange its arrival. Harley hit the seam because Harley had seen the safety blink wrong, and Art ran through the space like a person who could see doors where other people saw walls. At the forty-eight he planted with the good foot and at the thirty-two he let the other foot do what it could without asking it to prove anything. He got hit in the ribs by a boy who would be selling lawn mowers in five years and got up with a bruise that felt like someone’s name written wrong. He caught for eight, for twelve, for five with three yards after because he wanted them more than the other boy did. When he came to the sideline, Coach Landry didn’t knock his helmet; he didn’t say anything at all, which said a lot.

Deon did his part and then a little more, pinwheeling his arms in the kind of way that made the crowd remember it had elbows. Harley made one dumb throw and one that made the khaki men pretend they had seen better so they didn’t have to show it on their faces. Art found himself at a place on the field where the hash looked like a map he could read and felt, for a minute, like he was standing inside a sentence that had decided to be kind.

In the second half the ankle chirped a note higher than he liked and he did something he had been sure he didn’t have in him: he waved himself out. Harley looked pissed for one blink and then nodded because he cared about next week more than he cared about this play and that is the thing about quarterbacks we do not talk about enough. Bryce met him with tape and eyes and asked nothing he didn’t already know. When he sat, Rhea caught his line of sight and made the motion again—palms up, what. He gave her a thumbs-up because sometimes you answer in symbols for the sake of the person who needs to see your hand.

They won by nine because the other team’s kicker developed a personal relationship with the left upright, and afterward the alumni who never left this town clapped him on the back and told him to get one more for them while they remembered being twenty. He found Rhea near the concession stand where the air smelled like wet popcorn that had sinned. She looked at him like she was taking inventory and found everything still on the shelf.

“You did the thing where you sat down,” she said, pleased as if she’d been waiting to use that sentence and got to. “You make it look easy and it isn’t and I’m not going to clap because that feels like the wrong response but I am impressed with your restraint.”

“I want to be able to go in October,” he said before he realized he’d picked the wrong word, and she raised an eyebrow and made it right with her mouth.

“Play,” she said. “You want to be able to play in October. Good. Same.”

They walked beneath the aluminum that made the night sound like rain and made conversation with the people’s heads above them and their shoes slapping out that hollow stadium rhythm. Denise had come this time. She stood with Mia under the food sign and looked like she might adopt a chili dog out of pity. She hugged him in a way that avoided wet spots he didn’t know his uniform still had and said, “You got sense,” which was her version of congratulations. Mia showed him a drawing of a helmet with the moon on it and said, “You should get this on the side,” and he said, “Only if Coach lets me be nocturnal,” and she made a face that tried and failed to be patient.

The next week filled itself how weeks do when a thing approaches. The apartment of days had suitcases in the hall and no one had zipped them yet. Rhea and Nora shopped for a headlamp and motion sickness pills and those little packets that keep things from getting damp in boxes. Nora came over with lists and Denise wrote a list right next to hers and looked at it as if together the lists made a bridge. They discovered they both said bless in the same exasperated way and that if you stand long enough in a kitchen you either cry or laugh or make another pot of coffee who needed none of you. They did all three.

Art wrote his essay and let Rhea read it on the porch where the words could escape if they didn’t like him anymore. He put the thing he wasn’t supposed to write in the middle where no one could accuse him of leading with it and then he set around it all the other things he had learned that were not about football but sounded like they were. He wrote about counting steps so you could forget to count them when it mattered. He wrote about how the field is fair to no one and thus fair. He wrote about Denise’s spaghetti the wrong way and how sometimes doing a thing wrong on purpose because you had to is still food. He put in one sentence that was almost too much and cut it, and Rhea made a face like he had put on a shirt backwards and she wasn’t going to say anything because she loved him enough to let him leave like that.

“You didn’t lie,” she said when she handed it back, tapping her nail on the few places where he’d changed a word to make a grown-up feel a feeling. “You told enough truth to be proud. You didn’t apologize for liking a thing you’re good at. That’s hard.”

“You really think I like it,” he asked, before he could stop himself, and the question left his mouth like a bird that had knocked itself silly against a window and found the opening.

She huffed, affectionate. “You like the part where your body and your brain stop arguing and agree to be in the same place. You like the moment where you catch and then everything inside you is quiet because you did the thing you could do. If that’s not like, it’s next to it. We can call it that until you’re ready to say it out loud in church.”

He folded the essay and slid it into a folder and then into his bag and then under the bed because some things you put where even you have to kneel to get them. He fell asleep with his ankle throbbing and his hand smelling faintly like rope, and dreamed he was on a boat he had no right to be on, doing a job he had been given without an interview, and woke up with the feeling that he had not betrayed anyone.

Two days before she left, she met him at the river early enough that even the geese hadn’t remembered to be mean. The path was theirs except for a man in a neon vest who nodded like he had been paid to witness the day begin. The water moved with that low authority it had in fall when it was resigned to the trees bossing it with their leaves. They walked to a bend where the current condensed and the sound made you think long thoughts without meaning to.

“I’ve been practicing the ladder,” she said, and it took him a second to remember that meant sleeping with her hands above her head so she could reach for a rung when the boat thought about throwing her. “I’ve been practicing sleeping while everyone else moves. I’ve been practicing not telling my mother to pull over and let me out because my stomach got opinions. Practice is funny. People think it’s what you do to get good. Mostly it’s what you do to survive your own mind.”

He threw a rock sidearm and watched it skip once and then surrender because this was the river, not a pond that needed to flatter him. He reached into his sweatshirt pocket and pulled out a small rectangle. He’d made one thing he could make without a ball or a field. It was a route tree he’d drawn with a Pilot pen on the back of a Waffle House receipt, six routes in fat black, arrowheads crisp, a little X for his stance. On the bottom he’d written, Don’t forget the hitches, like a private joke. He handed it to her with a sheepishness he hated and she took it with a reverence he hadn’t earned.

“I’ll put it under my pillow the first night,” she said, too serious for him to argue with. “I’ll dream your feet where mine don’t go right.”

She handed him something too, a small steel shackle, the pin screwed in just enough to move but not fall out. It fit in his palm like a lesson. “For luck,” she said, and then shook her head at herself because she didn’t believe in luck unless you did something to deserve it. “Or for remembering that sometimes you tie a thing right and sometimes you take it off and try again. Don’t wear it on your neck and turn into a man I would laugh at. Keep it in your bag like a good-luck rock if you have to, if that’s the language that helps.”

He put it in his pocket with his keys and for the rest of the walk the shackle knocked gently against his thigh like a small animal trying to make itself known. They sat on a bench that had been donated in honor of a man named Ernie who had loved birds and the Bible and had been good at both in a way the plaque believed mattered. A kid on a scooter zipped by and then returned to make a face at them and show them a worm he had found on the path that he was certain was a snake. Someone’s dog barked at the water like it could scold it into stopping.

“When you go,” he said, and heard how stupid he sounded even as the words arranged themselves. “Call me if you can and don’t if you can’t. I mean—call if you need. No. Call if you want. Call if you want me to hear your voice. I’ll—” He stopped and looked at the water and did not finish because sometimes you don’t get to write the last line.

She bumped her shoulder into his. “I will send you pictures of the sky you think you already know. I will send you a sound when I can figure out how to send sounds. I will bring back a word you didn’t know you needed and I will not tell you which one until I hand it to you. That’s my promise.”

He nodded and it felt like signing a contract with your head.

The morning of the leaving came in fog that made the streetlights into weird moons. Nora had stacked the trunk with duffel bags and a bucket with gloves and a headlamp and a thermos. Denise stood by the curb with her arms crossed to keep herself from wringing her hands in a way she’d promised herself not to. Mia sat on the porch steps with a hand-lettered sign that said BYE in bubble letters with teeth, because goodbye sounded too final and she was thirteen and knew how to make a word uglier so it hurt less.

Ray’s monster truck idled like it couldn’t decide whether it wanted to be useful or loud. He put one box into Nora’s trunk and stood back like he had done something noble. Nora wore two braids like she was going into battle and an expression that said she would show mercy to the weak and kill a man as necessary. She put her hands on Rhea’s face and said nothing anyone else could hear. Rhea put her hands over Nora’s wrists and said something back with a roundness that made Denise look away because mothers deserve their own language.

Art handed up the last bag, a beat-up green duffel with a zipper that had learned patience. He didn’t know where to put himself as all the versions of leaving took their turns. He thought about the first time he had stood in a driveway and watched someone go. He thought about the way his legs had hurt after that because he had stood so long without doing anything with them. He thought about Ms. Faircloth saying he could feel more than one thing at once and considered filing a complaint.

Rhea came to him in the shadow of the open trunk. The fog had settled on her hair and made it look like a skill and not a mess. “I have twenty minutes before my mother will turn into a different version of herself,” she said, soft. “I’m going to use ten on you.”

They walked to the end of the cul-de-sac where Magnolia Glade widened into a small stage no one had asked for. The Big Chicken was a rumor in the distance and its beak creaked once like it had woken up wrong. The air smelled like pennies again because sometimes the same smell comes back just to see whether you notice. He took her hand and she took his and then they didn’t for a second because their bodies remembered they were in a place where some man was raking his yard.

“I’m coming back,” she said, as if certainty were a muscle you could flex. “It is only a month and maybe some. I am not a ghost you will have to write poems about. I am not a test. I am a person moving around the world bringing my stupid laugh with her. If you need me to say I will try very hard not to fall off the side, I will say it. If you need me to say I will fall in love with something that isn’t a boy, I will say that too.”

“I don’t want to keep you,” he said, and now the stupid was bald and honest and he kept going because his throat had decided to trust him. “I want—this sounds bad. I want to be a place you can come back to.”

She licked her bottom lip and looked at his mouth and then lifted her eyes to his like there was a reason to go in that order. “Then be a place,” she said. “You are good at that when you remember that staying isn’t the same as stopping. Run like you are appearing. Do it like I am watching. And when I am not watching, keep doing it because you are watching and that matters more.”

They kissed like they had practiced not scaring each other and now were done practicing. Neither of them cried because they weren’t those people that morning. They breathed each other in and stepped back before the air could turn into a wall. She touched the spot on his thigh where the shackle knocked through his pocket and patted it once like a farmer patting the hood of a truck. “Don’t lose that because if you do I will call you and yell about how men lose good hardware,” she said, and he promised not to, knowing full well he would check the pocket seven times a day.

Nora beeped the horn not because she was impatient but because sometimes you have to move a story forward or it will crawl into the house and eat your kitchen table. Denise hugged Rhea like she had a note in her pocket that said how. Mia handed Rhea the BYE sign and immediately asked for it back because she wanted to hang it in her room and tell people it was art. Ray shook Rhea’s hand like a father-in-law in a movie who had to give an okay no one had asked for and then laughed at himself before anyone else could.

When the car pulled away, Art stood with his hands in his pockets not because he wanted to look casual but because he had to hold himself in. The fog made the street short and kind. The taillights became two careful cherries and then pink and then nothing. The Big Chicken blinked twice as if it had a sense of humor. Denise put her hand on the back of his neck and rubbed once, a circle with her thumb. It put him back in a place he could not possibly return to and he didn’t mind the ache.

“She’ll be alright,” Denise said, stating this because she needed to hear it in her own voice. “You better be, too. Stop standing like your feet can’t make a decision.”

He nodded and they went inside and the house felt different and not. The kitchen held an onion. The television offered people suing each other for ridiculous sums. The table with the wobbly leg was still wobbly. The list of schools was under his bed and his cleats waited by the back door like dogs who had learned not to scratch. He went to his room and pulled out the little steel shackle and set it on his nightstand and then picked it back up because it looked too much like a thing left. He put it in the bottom of his bag and then took it out and then laughed at himself and finally tucked it into the pocket of the hoodie he wore to practice because some decisions are not noble so much as practical.

Practice that afternoon had a lightness like a gym class with fewer rules. The guys ran routes with open mouths and jokes that rose like birds, and Coach watched and did not say he was happy because men of his generation who taught other men how to run believe in letting joy sneak up and tap your shoulder instead. Bryce made him balance on a foam pad one more time and rolled his eyes when Art tried to do too much too fast. “You cannot get there faster by standing on one foot longer than I told you to,” Bryce said, dry. “You can get hurt. Those are different medals.”

They went to film, the school’s cinderblock room with a projector the color of mustard and chairs that had seen better chewing gum. Harley paused a play and backed it up and said, “You see here how the safety is showing church and then goes to the movies,” and the room laughed because it was a joke that pretended to be about football and was also about being seventeen. Art watched himself on the screen with a distance he had not had in August and saw both the thing he did right and the thing he would do better. He saw he was not in love with disappearing.

That evening the house was louder than usual, as if it had to fill the Rhea-shaped quiet with noise so it wouldn’t echo. Denise tried a new recipe and cursed at the cilantro like it had cheated at a card game. Mia FaceTimed a cousin in South Carolina and showed him the BYE sign, and he said it looked like a monster eating the word and she said exactly. Ray came in with grease on his knuckles and a story about a man in a plaid shirt who had tried to sell him a washing machine out of a van and the way Ray told it made them all feel lucky to be in a world where such foolishness was possible and survivable. Art smiled when he wasn’t careful and let himself sit on the floor with his back against the couch and his foot up on a cushion and he did not get up when someone else could have gotten the salt.

Later, he went outside with his phone and stared at it like you stare at a pond so still you think it might be glass. He typed, you gone yet, and deleted it because he was not a man who made grammar mistakes when he worried. He typed, is the sky different east of Augusta, and deleted it because he sounded like a boy with a postcard collection. He typed, picture? and left it because sometimes you can ask for the small thing you want. She sent a photo of the road ahead, gray ribbon, trees turning the kind of green that lets go easy, and the tiny postage stamp of sky winning over the fog. The caption said, it’s pretending to be nice, and he laughed and the sound went around his own head and back in his ear.

He took the knot off his wrist and retied it in the quiet, slowly, checking over and under like a person who had learned his own hands on another day and wanted to remember them. He put it back, the loop snug, and imagined the deck under Rhea’s feet and the wind insisting on a shape for the day. He closed his eyes and saw the field and then the river and then a version of himself that was not running away from anything.

When the weekend came, he went to the middle school field where his summer had behaved like fate and his fall had been arranged by tape. He took a bag of cones because he had learned that appearing needs a map. He laid them out in a pattern that looked like nonsense if you didn’t understand, a slant from a reduced split, a dig behind a linebacker who would never be fast enough, a corner that bent instead of snapped because his ankle told him to be merciful. He ran them, breath steady, arms quiet, fingers ready, the little steel in his pocket sending its private knock. Cobb Parkway hummed like a cheap machine that still worked and, down the road, the Big Chicken turned its beak as if to say, everything ridiculous you grew up with is still here.

He ran until the light tilted and the mosquitoes staged their daily referendum and voted to love him. He ran when he wanted to stop because stopping is a thing you do when your breath and your head agree and that agreement sometimes comes later than you expect. He ran until the dusk took on that old bruise color he had known since August, more plum than grape, more ripeness than hurt. When he had done enough to convince his body that it belonged to him, he lay down in the grass, ankle talking a little, heart going like a radio you could trust for the weather.

He let the noise of the road be the noise for a change. The cranes far off at the mall did their slow dinosaur rotation. An airplane cut its line across the sky and he wondered if any plane had ever flown the same line twice and decided no, because even the air changes its mind. His phone buzzed and he rolled to his side to read it. It was Rhea, a photo taken from a low angle, steel, rope, a square of sail, a slice of sky so bright it made his eyes water. The caption said: found the floor, got my legs. He could hear the water in the picture even though the sound didn’t travel. He typed back, we executed and more, and she wrote, show out then, and he wrote, appearing, and she sent a little anchor even though they both believed in its opposite and he put the phone on his chest and watched the last of the light go and let wanting sit beside him without taking the only chair.Chapter Seven

The first night after Rhea left that the wind remembered how to be sharp, Art lay in bed and watched the shadow of the window frame slide across his ceiling like a slow metronome. The house ticked in its familiar places, the settling in the hallway, the hum of the fridge shouldering on, the quiet cough of the air vent that always sounded like it was undecided. He had tucked the small steel shackle into the pocket of his practice hoodie and worn the hoodie to sleep in a way that made him feel like he was hiding money from himself. When he closed his eyes he could see the picture she sent from the dock—ropes in polite coils, a square of deck, a shoulder with a smear of salt that had dried to a ghost—and he could hear the part of her voice that did not want to admit it was scared still finding a way to be honest about wanting.

October carried itself like a person late to a meeting with someone important. The mornings were brisk without committing, the afternoons apologized, and the evenings made promises they weren’t entirely sure they could keep. Football practices moved earlier because the light left sooner, and Coach Landry took the ball cap off in a reverent way he didn’t notice as he peered at the field like a pastor evaluating a sanctuary after a storm. Art’s ankle had learned to be quiet when asked, and he learned to ask more politely, which is one of the differences between an August boy and an October boy. Yasmin at therapy had introduced him to muscles he had never been properly introduced to, little supporters that lived lower in his calf and around his hip like bodyguards who had finally been given their own job titles. Sometimes he caught himself standing with both feet evenly planted and felt ridiculous pride, like a toddler who had thrown his own diaper away.

The men in khaki returned with clipboards and stadium blankets and voices pitched low so as not to scare the thing they were hunting. Harley shook their hands with confidence that didn’t offend and then threw in warm-ups with a ferocity directly proportional to how many of them had hats with logos no one in town had ever seen in person. Deon developed a new habit of pointing at Art across the huddle and announcing to no one that he would like twelve targets this game like it was a request at a diner. “You order off the menu,” Art told him, to which Deon replied that he would like his targets smothered, covered, and blessed, and Harley said, “Y’all shut up,” like a kind older cousin who had learned to make mothering sound like a dare.

On a Thursday he found a postcard in the mailbox with the postmark smudged and a picture of a lighthouse that looked like a prosthetic. The writing was in Rhea’s blocky hand that had always looked like it had been taught by someone impatient. It said, in not quite straight lines, that the ship had a name like a person and a kitchen they insisted on calling a galley which made even peanut butter feel ceremonial. She wrote that she had slept with one leg wedged on the inside of a bunk because the floor moved out from under you the way she had warned him it would and that she had found the right rope for her hands the way you find the right pen and decide that if you cannot steal it, you will at least remember the smell of the ink. She said she had been up on a yard—she drew a little stickly picture to clarify—and that looking down at the water in the morning made her understand why birds simply go. She signed it with a little square knot drawn almost correctly and then a confession that she’d been yelled at for leaving a coil ugly and that she had corrected it and the correction had felt, somehow, like a compliment.

On the Friday that turned cold enough to make lungs honest, the rival from across the county came to their field with a marching band that had learned one song and come to a different conclusion about how many ways it could be played. The bleachers were a collection of coats in colors no one would wear on purpose in spring, and Denise unrolled an old blanket with a wolf on it and draped it over her knees like a joke about keeping mean at bay. Mia sat on the step under her and kept count of how many times cheerleaders said the word fight without being paid for it. In the second quarter, Harley checked to a slant because the corner had gotten bored and decided to blink long and hard right before the snap, and Art put his foot down like a man testing ice and ran into a space that felt made for him. The ball hit him right in the place it should hit him and the first tackler turned out to be hands and air, and the second one hit all the right places at all the wrong times and Art spun because sometimes the body is smarter than your mind and keeps spinning when it gets surprised. He came to the sideline with grass in his facemask and the clink of his clip loosening, and Coach Landry grabbed his shoulder and squeezed the exact amount that told him good, but not yet.

At halftime, under the aluminum awning where boys shook water out of their helmets like dogs, Deon leaned back against the cinderblock and said, in a voice that pretended it wasn’t proud, “Your girl left and you got faster.” Art threw an orange peel at him and said, “Your boy stayed and got louder,” and Deon laughed in a way that made other boys, listening without looking like they were listening, exhale. In the third quarter, Art felt the ankle whisper and waved himself out on a second and short that made the crowd do that sound that isn’t a boo but is the cousin of a boo. Coach stood beside him pretending to watch the field and said out of the side of his mouth, “Thank you,” in a tone that put the word in a pocket that isn’t used often enough.

After the game, which they won because the other team refused to believe in tackling in the fourth quarter more than they believed in anything else, Art’s phone lit up with a voicemail that had been made six hours ago and had found its way through the machinery of cell towers and weather anyway. He sat on the curb outside the field house with his feet on the place where water had tried and failed to make a path downhill and listened. Rhea’s voice sounded like it had been run through cloth. She told him she had stood a night watch and finally understood why the stars had been named like they had jobs, and that she had learned what lee meant and wanted to pass it to him like she’d promised she would pass him a word he didn’t know he needed. She explained it in the kind of patient voice you use with a person you trust to learn something on the first try: the lee is the side the wind hits last, the place where you’re shielded, where you can breathe and tie what needs tying without feeling like the sky is your supervisor. She breathed out when she said it and he could hear the relief in that breath like a sentence escaping the dictionary.

At home, Denise fell asleep in her chair with the game on behind her muted, and Ray came in late and stood in the doorway like a man who had just come back from a place where directions don’t translate. He smelled like aluminum and diesel, a combination that always made Art think of men who knew how to fix things other people had the luxury of breaking. “You eat,” Ray asked into the dim, and when Art said he had, Ray opened the fridge anyway and stood there the way men stand in front of light when they feel like their decisions haven’t kept. He took out leftover spaghetti in a thrift-store container that Denise favored because it kept the sauce where it should be. When he forked it into his mouth cold, he winced and then shrugged and took another bite. At the table, he said, careful like crossing a creek in spring, that he’d be gone the next couple weekends because the Macon run had turned into a Savannah run and that paid better in a way that made the whole sentence look less guilty. Art nodded and didn’t bother to say he understood because this house preferred demonstrations to declarations.

Mia came in with a drawing of a ship whose sails were the shape of lungs, little bronchi lines running back down the masts. She had put eyes in the waves and a mouth under the bow. When Art raised his eyebrows at the mouth, she said, without a speck of drama, “Everything eats,” and then explained, with sincerity he could not fault, that she had started an art zine with two girls who wanted to fill a stapled packet with things they were trying to say but didn’t want to say out loud, and could she use the printer, and could he donate two dollars and some change for staplers. He did both and stood there while she held up the first issue, which had Come Hither written in a font that was exactly wrong and exactly right, and he smiled because the tiny things that make a life look back at you and grin are the ones the big things like to ignore.

Monday brought a letter in a large envelope with a return address that had looked like a joke to him since he was nine and Deon had explained to him that this was the place where the men on TV wore red like a statement about blood. Ms. Faircloth, when he brought it to her office and put it on her desk without opening it like a cat with something it had dragged in, lifted her eyebrows and said, “We do not worship envelopes,” and then slid a pair of scissors toward him like she was teaching him something about agency. He opened it and read a paragraph of words that had been written by a committee and approved by an office and yet managed to say something that had weight: the offer was there, a place at a table if he stayed what he said he would be and didn’t break. He didn’t jump or whoop or run down the hall to show Deon and have Deon lift him on his shoulders like it was a state fair; he held the paper and thought about the way Coach had said heroes get statues and players get games. He realized he didn’t want to be the kind of hero bronze makes. He wanted to be the kind of player who had to make lists about which socks were clean.

Coach Landry called him into his office after practice when the heat rising off the field made the room feel like soup and shut the door in a way that made Art sit up straighter than usual. Coach gestured at a chair with a hand that had been bitten by two generations of whistles. “This is where men start talking to you like they’re selling you cars,” he said without preface. “You nod. You listen. You don’t sign anything without your mama peeking at it and making her scrunch face first. You answer your phone only when you can hear your own voice, not when a win or a loss is still rattling around in it.” He took off his hat and put it on his knee and ran his finger along the sweat line like it was a map. “Also, not for nothing,” he added, softer, “playoffs go to the boys who remembered to eat breakfast in June. You did. Keep doing it. November is a mean month if you forgot to love the basics.”

At night the house did the thing it did where every time the heater kicked on, the whole structure shook its head like it had remembered a joke it hadn’t meant to tell. Denise told him, standing at the sink with her hands in soapy water and a patience that would never be paid what it was owed, that she had once gotten a letter she hadn’t shown him because the letter wasn’t worth the argument it came with. “It was from your daddy and also not from him,” she said, picking up a spoon from the water like it had something to say. “It was words someone else told him to write, honey. There are folks who think they can heal you by telling you how they hurt. I didn’t let it in because I wasn’t going to do that to you. If that makes me wrong, well.” She trailed off in a way that said she knew there were worlds where she would be the villain and wasn’t going to let them have this house.

The week the clocks marched back an hour like an army of idiots, Rhea called from a dock where gulls had opinions and told him a story about a simple job that wasn’t. They had come into a small harbor where everything was closer to everything else than it should be and the wind had gotten contrary out of spite. She said they had to take in sail at the exact tempo the wind would permit and she had found herself holding a piece of rope with a name older than her aunt and feeling as if it had the right to judge her. “I did not cry,” she said, matter-of-fact, proud in a way that was so unperformed it felt more true than any boast. “I did the thing of going slower to make it smoother and watched the older girl’s face until it told me I was allowed to go faster again. When we got it, the captain said, ‘Good hands,’ and I thought of you or maybe I thought of what you told me Coach says about the little things, and both those thoughts felt like good luck.” She told him she had eaten soup standing up and it had been the best soup in a way that had nothing to do with the soup itself and everything to do with who was handing spoons to whom. She said she was learning the names of wind not because she would tell anyone later but because the names themselves did something to you when you said them in order: breeze, fresh, strong, near gale, and then—that place she didn’t want to visit.

He learned to stop counting days and started counting how many times he had retied the bowline on his wrist. Each time he undid it and made it again, his fingers got smoother, less inclined toward panic, more apt to trust the loop was going where it had gone before. He found himself teaching Deon to tie it in the training room while they waited for Bryce to write enough tape around Deon’s thigh to keep a man two inches taller from leaning on him across the line. “Tie me to this bench,” Deon said, grinning, and Art refused the joke and just taught him the knot, and Deon shook his head and said, “Look at you, Scout,” and then practiced again when he thought no one was watching.

At Mia’s middle school a boy called her friend a name and took her pencil and she drew him with a fish head and gave it to him and the boy cried because the drawing was better at being mean than children are supposed to be. Art went to talk to the vice-principal because Denise refused to be a woman yelling at an office full of filing cabinets again, and he stood in a chair that was too small for him and explained that Mia’s second language was drawing and taking that from her was the same as pushing her down. The vice-principal looked at him with surprise that wasn’t unkind and wrote a note to put in a folder and said he admired a brother who used his words and Art almost laughed because his words were the part of him he liked least and most, depending on which hour you asked.

A storm came through at two in the morning and ripped the roof’s cheap tar paper up like it had been taped by someone in a hurry. It blew rain under the eaves and against the back door, which made a sound like someone begging to be let in and someone else refusing. The power went for an hour, and the Big Chicken down on Cobb lit up from a generator in a way that made it look like it had survived a war. Art stood at his window in the dark and listened to the rain try every part of the house, testing for soft spots. He thought of Rhea on watch with rain that was not suburban, rain that was water’s aggression made honest, and he pressed his forehead to the glass and whispered an apology to the sky for assuming its instability was personal. When the lights came back, Denise called out “Thank you, Jesus,” and then, “And Cobb EMC,” in a way that acknowledged the source even if she didn’t like it.

He received a second envelope that had a different shade of important and put it with the first without telling anyone because he wanted to see if wanting got smaller or bigger when you set it next to something the same weight. He discovered that want is like a sourdough starter. If you feed it, it lives. If you ignore it, it still sits there and talks under its breath. On a Tuesday Ms. Faircloth stopped him in the hall and told him she had read his essay again and that the line about the field being fair to no one and thus fair had made her want to clap in the cafeteria. On a Wednesday, Harley announced to the entire offense that he had decided to stop dating until after playoffs because girls were more complicated than cover two, and Deon told him very earnestly that he should consider dating cover three instead. On a Thursday, Coach handed out new practice jerseys and made a show of tossing Art a white one when Art had been wearing blue all year, and the boys hooted for reasons that made no sense outside of this building, and Art pretended he didn’t like the way white made his arms look like they belonged to someone who had done work.

Nora knocked on their door with a pie in a tin that had been used for pies for twenty years and an expression that said if anyone made a joke about pie, she would eat them instead. She came in smelling like industrial soap and coffee and hugged Denise the way women who have agreed to tell each other their tired parts hug. They sat at the table with the wobbly leg and discussed the absurdity of health insurance as if it were a neighbor who never returned a casserole dish on time. Nora told them she had a picture of Rhea up on the refrigerator next to a shipping schedule written in permanent marker so she could pretend permanence existed. She confessed that she had stood in Rhea’s room and folded a sweater she had left on purpose and then unfolded it because she did not want to impose order that wasn’t requested. Denise told her that she had once taken a shirt of Art’s out of the hamper and put it back on the floor because she suspected that particular shirt only knew where it was if it smelled like day four, and they both laughed in a way that allowed the room to exhale. They left the pie, which was pumpkin that tasted like all the years they had said no to dessert and shouldn’t have, and a note under the magnet that read, He eats too fast, tell him to slow down, and Denise put a smiley face next to it in ink and rolled her eyes at herself for putting a smiley face in ink.

The last game before the first week of playoffs came on a cold that made boys breathe like steam engines and made the sound of pads on pads sharper than it had been in a month. The field was hard at the edges and crunchy, a different kind of slip under your cleats, not mud, not slick grass, but something that wanted to make your hips argue with you about honesty. Art took the field and felt the bowline under his tape like a secret and the shackle in his hoodie pocket when he warmed up and then put the hoodie on the bench where everyone’s hoodies went to smell like nerves. Mid-second quarter he caught a ball high and paid for it low, a helmet in the thigh and a knee that only half loved him, and he lay on the ground for the count of one and then got up because he had learned that laying down can sometimes be romanticized beyond its usefulness. He jogged two steps longer than necessary to prove to Bryce, who was watching him like a hawk, that he had earned a few more snaps. Coach put a hand on his back as he walked past and murmured, “Player,” like he was reminding Art of a password.

After the game, when their breath made clouds in the parking lot and the world smelled like hot metal and old popcorn, he got a text from a number he didn’t recognize with a little voice memo attached. It was Rhea, stealing the boat phone in a voice that admitted guilt and refused apology, reading a list of clouds she had decided meant something when you were too far out to pretend the shore would save you. She said she had learned to tell a squall by the shape of it and that she had seen water standing taller than a person and felt, oddly, like it was trying to impress her, not kill her. She closed with a thing that made him sit down on the bumper of Ray’s truck: “I stood on the lee side and the world stopped being an argument for just long enough for me to tie the line and breathe. I want you to have lee sometimes when you’re running in a county that thinks wind is just a rumor. Make some for yourself even if you have to turn your own body to block for your own heart. That’s the word. That’s my word. Keep it.”

He took the long way home past the Big Chicken because sometimes he needed to see it to remind himself that a town could adore a ridiculous thing without explanation. The beak creaked and the eye rolled in a way that made it look like a bored god. He stopped at a red light with no other cars at the intersection and waited for it to be green because he had decided when he was eleven that the rules were how you proved to strangers you could be trusted when they weren’t looking. At the house, Denise was at the table with bills and Mia was on the floor with markers and Ray was on the couch with a wrench in his hand as if he had fallen asleep in the middle of a thought. Art went to his room and lay the shackle on the nightstand, then picked it up because it looked lonely, then laughed at himself for personifying a piece of hardware, and finally put it back in his hoodie pocket because sometimes habits are the only little faith you have.

The week between felt like the string on the back of a wind-up toy being pulled slowly. He got a call from a coach at a school with a bird for a mascot who told him he loved his tape and his hands and his “ability to separate,” which made Art think of divorce and he had to work to remember this man meant hips and timing. The coach said the word family so many times it became a sound and then a shape and then nothing at all. Art nodded and said thank you and hung up and wrote down the man’s name in his notebook and next to it the words sounds like my uncle and hoped that would mean something to him later. Ms. Faircloth cornered him at the vending machine and told him she had carved out a time slot for him to sit in the library and send emails with subject lines that sounded like sincerity had been poured into a glass and set gently on a coaster, and he said he’d be there and he was, which felt like a small miracle and also simply maturity.

He ran routes on the middle school field in the thin light after last bell and before dinner, cones set in a pattern that looked like a language only he and a few other boys on earth could read fluently. He practiced the small things: the eyes up before the break, the shoulders lying to the man across from him, the hands meeting the ball like it owed them rent, the second step low enough to tell the ground you respected it. Cobb Parkway hummed its tires-on-concrete hymn and the winter-brown grass tried to poke through his socks and he let it because small hurts are part of reminding yourself that your skin is still where you left it. He ran until the shadows turned mean and then he jogged home and the porch light he had fixed in October said, quietly, good evening.

When Friday came again, he dressed without hurry and taped the wrist on which the bowline sat as if he had tied it on the tape itself, and he looked in the mirror and saw a boy who didn’t feel like a boy and a man who wasn’t done being a boy and he shrugged at both of them and said, “Let’s go,” in a voice he recognized. On the field, the breath came easy on the first drive and he let it be easy, which is different from letting it be lazy. He caught a hitch and turned it into eight and clapped his own hands when he came back to the huddle because sometimes you are your own cheerleader if you want to be a player and not a statue. He found the seam and trusted Harley to find him and HARLEY DID and it felt like a sentence being finished in the right language. Late in the fourth, up by three with the other team trying to tell a different story, he ran a slant and then stopped like he had hit a wall only he could see and the ball came and he sat down into it and then stood up and turned and ran, and it felt like appearing. He went down on purpose when two men with angles that made no sense converged, and the crowd made a sound that wanted more, and Coach clapped once without looking at him, and that clap felt like lee.

After, when the town had done its honk in the parking lot and the boys had sprayed each other with something cold and tasted like sugar and bad decisions, he stood under the light with his helmet at his hip and looked up and saw that the stars had come back sharper because the air had cleared. He thought about standing a night watch and the way your body would try to convince you that dark is a reason for fear even when you know better. He thought about the word lee and how you could make it by adjusting your own shoulders relative to a wind and he smiled because learning to stand correctly had been a thing Yasmin had given him that he hadn’t known he would need for anything outside of a training room. He pulled out his phone and typed, we won, clean, and then, i’m practicing lee, and hit send before he could dress it up or take it back.

On Sunday, before church that he wouldn’t attend because football had made Sundays into a different kind of religion, he drove to the river that wasn’t a river, parked in the lot where joggers stretched and made deals with their hamstrings, and walked the path to the bend where you heard the water argue more convincingly. He sat on Ernie’s bench and took the shackle out and held it up, stupidly, like it might give him advice. A leaf big as his face slid by and got caught for a second in a little eddy and then broke free and moved on and he loved it for that in a way that embarrassed him. He took the Polaroid of the last good light he and Rhea had stolen in town from his bag and looked at it and then put it away because he didn’t want to make the picture do too much work. He closed his eyes and let his breath find the cadence he discovered on nights under lights when the ball is on its way and there is nothing else to be done. He sat, and the wind found him, and for a minute he made lee, and he smiled like a person who is allowed to claim a thing they made for themselves and hasn’t yet been taught to be ashamed of it.Chapter Eight

The first frost showed up like glitter someone had spilled in the dark. It glossed the lawns in Magnolia Glade and made every blade of grass into a thing that could cut if you touched it wrong. Art stepped out to get the paper because Denise liked to ask him what the news was and then ignore it on purpose. The cold bit his ears and moved in under the hem of his hoodie like a nosy aunt. He breathed and watched the air make a ghost of him and thought of Rhea on a deck somewhere east of them, breath smoking out in a place that didn’t pretend to be gentle just because the month had flipped. He had slept with the bowline on again and it had stamped a polite circle into his wrist he had to rub to make go away. When he bent to pick up the rubber-banded cylinder of headlines, his ankle said a quiet sentence he could live with. He straightened and said a quiet sentence back.

Inside, Denise had a stack of papers that were not the news and were more dangerous. The FAFSA sat like a dare. Forms with boxes asked the same kinds of questions in six different fonts, each box the square mouth of a fish expecting you to throw it the right bit of food. She had a pen in her teeth and a mug by her elbow and a look like she was going to sit there until either the forms blinked first or the day did. Mia padded in wearing a T-shirt with sleeves too long and socks that insisted on being stripes and poured cereal without looking at the bowl, like luck could be taught.

“What’s the news,” Denise asked, taking the paper like it was a hot plate.

“It’s going to be cold,” he said. “A dog saved a toddler from a ditch. The county wants to fix the bridge you like and break three others you don’t.”

“They always want to fix things that don’t ask for fixing,” she said, which was a version of a political philosophy she did not care to develop further. She tapped the top of the form with her teeth and then took the pen out of her mouth and sighed. “We’re going to have to call your father at some point.”

Art stood there with a breath half in and half out. The house didn’t get quieter because it was already as quiet as a house full of women and a bag of worry could be at eight in the morning. Mia looked up from her spoon with the kind of focus she had when she drew feet and hands and other parts that had too many lines. “Do we,” she said, not unkind, not hopeful either, just curious how the story was going to tell itself this time.

Denise didn’t say his name. She rarely did. She looked at the box that wanted information about a man who lived somewhere where his mail found him and training yourself not to ask how went an entire season of the year. “It’s how they make you say please,” she said of the form. “We will tell them as much as they can stand and then some. Then we will make up the rest. I should have been a novelist.” She made her scrunch face at the numbers and then at her own scrunch face because humor had been her method since before the boys on the line learned to hit in the cold.

He thought about saying he would call, that he could be the one who dialed and listened to whatever voice answered, that he could let the sound of it knock around in his head without breaking anything important. He thought about the gray payphone at the end of his childhood street, the only way a person could make a voice jump distance without a phone of their own, and how he had stood with his hand on the cold metal bar of the receiver and not dialed because he had been ten and there were numbers in the world you didn’t touch. He said he would go see Ms. Faircloth later and Denise nodded, grateful in a way that put its hand on his shoulder.

At school the playoff signs went up in the hallways like someone was marketing a movie everyone had already seen and wanted to see again anyway. The band had learned a new song or pretended to, and they practiced it in the corner of the courtyard with breath rising from their bells like the instruments were smoking in a bad way. Harley tossed him an apple in the locker room because Harley was the kind of boy who believed fruit made leadership visible and Art caught it and tossed it back because he did not need his quarterback to discover his hands had butter. Deon came in wearing a hoodie with flames down the sleeves like he’d borrowed it from a man who washed car rims for a living. He shoulder-bumped Art and said, “Two weeks until I teach my auntie how to say state,” and Art said, “She already knows how to say it,” and Deon wagged his eyebrows and said, “Not like I want her to.”

Coach gathered them before practice and did the thing where he cleared his throat and rubbed the brim of his hat and looked like a man who had lined up words and changed his mind about which ones to spend. He said less than he had on weeks without playoffs, which made sense if you knew him. “You did not get lucky,” he said, which is what people say when they don’t want boys to build churches on a fluke. “You got good when no one was watching. Play like the work shows. Don’t marry the moment. You’ll be widowers by the third quarter.” He stuck his toothpick at the ground and then left it there for a second, standing up as if it had a will. “Also, leave your phones in your locker. If a man wearing a polo calls you while you’re tying your shoes, he can call you after you untie them.”

They ran. The air made lungs honest. Art felt the ankle do that at-the-door hitch and smoothed the feeling with breath and patience. He ran his routes like he was showing a new boy how to do it, not because he thought he knew everything but because teaching yourself again is how you don’t start lying to your own body. He heard Yasmin in his head—don’t hang your hip in the break; he felt the tape on his wrist where the bowline sat under it like a concealed blessing; he heard Rhea’s voice say lee and he adjusted his shoulders a degree so the wind that lived even in this small world would hit him last.

After, in the cinderblock room, Coach queued up film of the opponent that had made a living this year out of making other boys look like they had planned badly. The safety they would see had a nose for the ball, which is what you say about a boy you are too kind to call a thief. The corner wore his socks at his ankles like his calves had earned air. “He likes to grab and then complain when you run through him,” Coach said, tapping the screen with the back of his knuckle. “Don’t let a man make you a lawsuit.”

On the way out, as the sky went the color of a bruise you could admit to, Ms. Faircloth waylaid him in the breezeway by the art room and handed him a stack of paper with a Post-it stuck on top. “These are scholarships for people who know how to write sentences where the first word and the last word remember each other,” she said. “You can do that. Don’t look at me like I’m a liar. Also, bring your mother at four if she can. The forms want to be confusing in front of witnesses who can shake their heads.”

He brought Denise and she wore the nice sweater she pretended not to own. She sat in Ms. Faircloth’s office in a chair that spun and refused to spin because dignity had been her daily practice since the eighties. The two women wrestled the FAFSA like an animal in a book where animals could be rescued by patience. They eyed the line that asked for a man’s social security number like it had teeth. Denise said she didn’t have it. Ms. Faircloth said then they would write a statement, and she turned to the computer and typed one with the firmness of someone who had written a hundred truths and fifty lies and knew when each belonged. Denise signed the last page with her whole name, the one that sounded like a singer, and then blew on the ink like a woman who had fought a kind of fight that left no marks on her and more on the table. When it was done, Ms. Faircloth hunted in a drawer and brought out a wrapped peppermint like a nurse at a pediatrician’s office. Denise took it and laughed and put it in her pocket because candy meant you had survived.

At home, the forms added their weight to the pile on the table and Denise made chili that beamed warmth without apology. Ray came in with a tired grin that tried to be more than it was and put his hand on Art’s shoulder and said, “If you need new cleats because the old ones are talking back, we can make that happen,” and Art said he was good, and meant his shoes and more than that. Mia spread her zines out for them like tarot and pointed at the cover of the second issue, which had a drawing of a bus stop with no bus and three figures seen only by their shoes and a title that said Already Here. She wanted them to come to the release at the café near the Square and listen to girls with haircuts read things they had written and pretend to understand, and Denise said she would do one better and bring Capri Suns like contraband and Mia rolled her eyes and then smiled because being twelve and then thirteen is a whole year of forgiving your people for making the wrong jokes.

On Thursday night he got a text from a number that had not been on his phone in years but had been in his stomach since before the word stomach made sense. He stared at the screen and the name did not appear because he had not saved it, which was its own act of mercy. The text said, Saw your name in the paper. Proud of you. It was signed with an initial that could have been anyone’s. He turned the phone over and put it face down on the table and watched the glass black back at him. Denise walked through the room with a basket of laundry balanced on her hip and took one look at his face and then at the table and then at the basket and said, “Do you need me to take something outside and set it on fire,” and he almost laughed because setting things on fire had been her hypothetical solution for most of his adolescence. He shook his head and the weight of it moved from his chest to some place next to the shackle in his pocket and sat down there like baggage that hadn’t been claimed and might never be.

The first playoff Friday felt like the kind of day you are careful with. The air did the clean thing where it smelled like the inside of a frozen bottle, like someone had scrubbed the town overnight and forgotten to tell anyone not to track in mud. The whole place looked at the sky in the afternoon and decided to wear more clothes than yesterday. The parking lot at the field turned into a county fair for a county that only had one ride. The bleachers clinked as people took their places in rituals they pretended not to cherish. The men in khaki wore beanies and had clipboards with corners bent from all the hands that had clutched them. A girl in a letterman jacket painted her face with an M like she had been drafted by an army of one town.

Art taped the wrist, taped the ankle, sat with his feet flat and his breath tall. He put the hoodie with the shackle in it on the bench like he was putting a little church down to hold their coats. He looked over at the student section for the dumb comfort of knowing he was part of a day that made useless sense. He found Denise wrapped in the wolf blanket, Mia beside her in a hat with a pom-pom on top that made her look like the idea of joy, and next to them Nora had wedged herself in and was shouting at nobody in particular. He had not expected her. She waved a mittened hand and made a face like she was going to eat anyone who hit him dirty and then smiled as if to say she was mostly kidding.

The game started with both teams trying to persuade each other they were not impressed, which meant no one did anything impressive. On the third series, Harley saw something that wasn’t there and threw into the ghost of a route that had been called for last week and the corner from the other team caught the ball with complete confidence in the decision-making of strangers. The stadium made that sound crowds make when their plan is interrupted and Art clapped his hands once and put them on his hips because he had learned that your face can betray your people faster than your feet. He came to the sideline and looked at Coach and Coach gave him a look that meant we don’t try to get it back in one gulp, that meant we don’t chase, that meant you can forgive a boy in public without teaching him to be weak. He nodded and leaned over the chart with Harley and drew with his finger how the safety had rolled and where the space would be if they stopped arguing with the picture in their heads.

In the second quarter, he ran a skinny post and got bumped at the top and did not widen and let the bump be the wind, not the law. The ball came late, behind his back hip, and he stalled his feet just long enough to make his body a pocket. He caught it and rolled and the man who had bumped him went past him, momentum making decisions that had nothing to do with intelligence, and Art turned up and took twelve. When he got up he patted the ball like it was a dog who had found its way home. Deon did a thing that would read like a miracle on the stat sheet and like a joke in person, cutting behind a man who had believed he owned the sideline, and suddenly the night opened in a way that had nothing to do with weather.

At halftime they crowded under the aluminum that made their breath sound louder and Coach said very little again. He said they would win the third quarter, not the game, and he said to treat the first series after the half like a riddle they already knew the answer to and he looked at Art and, with his chin, told him to stop looking up in the stands, which Art pretended he hadn’t been doing. He drank water like he had earned it and thought about Rhea telling him a week ago that she had learned to climb with gratitude that her arms could do it even when her mind doubted her and he thought about the word lee and the way he could give himself a pocket of quiet even here. He closed his eyes for one second and made a little wind block inside himself and when he opened them the field looked less like a test and more like a sentence he could finish.

The third quarter treated them like a friend who had a bill to settle. The first two plays were losses that crunched. On third and twelve, the other team sent a boy with no regard for literature and Harley stepped back and lofted one to a place where only a person with a ladder for a spine could get it. Art went up because that was the thing to do and because the body had a way of saying yes to the sky when a yes had been warranted long enough inside. He caught it and the safety arrived late and hard and knocked the breath out of him so that for a second he lived somewhere else. He came back and the sound came back and he lay there for the count of two this time and then stood and walked because if you can move you should when boys you love are watching. On the sideline, Bryce put a hand on his sternum in the genteel way a man checks whether a machine still hums, and Art nodded and Bryce nodded back and that was their whole conversation.

In the fourth, up three and then down four and then up one because the kicker on their side remembered he could be useful, Art ran an out-and-up that he had not loved since June. His ankle mistrusted the corner of it. He sold the out without apology and when the corner bit like a fish with no business near a lake, he turned and did not look for the ball because you don’t look back at a thing you told the universe you wanted. Harley threw, and the ball hung a beat too long, and Art saw in the white of it all the times he had been alone on a middle school field in the heat that stuck and had told his feet yes until the ground agreed. He accelerated the last step like a person telling a story fast at the end to get to the part that matters and the ball came down into the triangle of his hands. He tucked it and took three and then lay down where the coaches told boys to lay down when the clock was the thing being murdered, not the other team. The crowd groaned and then, seeing the result on the scoreboard become a number that made them feel safe, cheered because people forgive what works.

They won like a person who knows how to shut a door quietly. In the handshake line, the other team’s corner stared at him a second longer than necessary and said, “You ain’t fast,” which was an insult where he came from, and Art said, “I’m where I need to be,” which was a sentence that would not make sense to everyone and made sense to him. He found Denise and Mia and Nora, who slapped his bicep like she was testing a watermelon, and when he turned to look for a particular face in the crowd, he remembered and then did the thing where remembering didn’t break him. He checked his phone at the edge of the track and there was a message Rhea had sent whenever the ocean and cell towers had agreed. It was just a recording of lines slapping a mast and a voice in the background telling somebody to ease, and in the middle, her laugh, quick and controlled like a knife trick, and then, at the end, the mute snap of wind when someone had done something right.

After, the town emptied out into cars that smelled like blankets and arguments about routes and the best way to get onto 41 without sitting at the light for a year. Art went to the café with Mia for her zine thing because she had insisted and also because his body had learned that sitting in chairs that weren’t metal warmed more than your hamstrings. The café had a chalkboard that told you when the band you’d never heard of was going to pretend to be famous and mason jars that did too much. It was full of girls with bangs cut at home and boys with notebooks and one adult with a denim jacket who had appointed herself curator of youth. Mia read a piece that started with a list of ways to say hello and ended with a drawing of a whale disguised as a city bus. She didn’t look at him while she read but she looked near him, which is sometimes more generous. Denise clapped like someone had brought her good gossip. When it was over, one of the girls asked for three dollars for the zine and Art gave her a five and told her to keep it, and she said she would not because she had to make change to respect the economy they were building, and he nodded and took two crumpled singles and wondered if this was how men felt at farmer’s markets when they bought honey from bees with cool names.

Nora sat with Denise and the two of them watched the room as if it were their daughters’ heads when they were toddlers and had first learned to run. Nora squeezed Art’s knee under the table and he felt, in that squeeze, a woman’s gratitude for the way he had become an edge for her girl to lean against without falling into. “This place is good,” Nora said, meaning both the café and the county and possibly the chair she was in at that moment. “I am not mad at it. Not right now.” She bit her bottom lip like she was tasting the admission and then shook her head at herself and laughed.

On the way home they passed the Big Chicken’s ridiculous face and Mia raised her zine in salute. The beak creaked as if in acknowledgement and they all laughed for no good reason and then for good reasons because sometimes the place you come from is your anchor and sometimes it is just a landmark, and either way, it gives you a place to point.

The next day was the kind of Saturday that lets boys pretend their legs have nothing to do until six, and Art slept later than his body thought it should and woke up with his wrist imprinted with the braided ghosts of the bowline. He went to the middle school field with cones because routine had become his quiet, and he laid them out and he ran and he didn’t count. He worked on the slow things, the dead-leg at the top of the route, the get-small through the window, the first three steps that make a defender wrong before he knows he has been insulted. He felt the weather finishing its turn and thought of Rhea’s word again and again until it became less exotic and more like a tool in the junk drawer—you could grab it when something rattled and be grateful later you had it. He put his hoodie on the JUGS machine and the weight of the shackle in the pocket was nothing, and also not nothing, and he liked how the two things could be true until he needed them not to be.

On Sunday, an aunt who had declared herself family at a funeral asked Denise if they were coming to church and Denise said yes before she could think and then sighed because sometimes she said yes to things to make the day feel used. They went, and the sanctuary smelled like wood and breath mints and a past Art had been dragged through and learned to be grateful for. The pastor said a thing about loaves and fishes and making enough where there wasn’t and Art thought about the way Coach divvied touches between him and Deon and a tight end who only came alive in November, and the thought did not feel sacrilegious. A man sang Amazing Grace with a voice that had skipped practice three decades but had practiced grief every day at work, and when Art closed his eyes he saw, not the ocean, but the river, and the way it could pretend to be still while carrying a whole town past you inch by inch.

After, in the parking lot where the greetings took as long as the service, while Mia counted how many different shades of brown people could find for coats, Ray said he had a Savannah run that would keep him across two Fridays and that he would try to move things around because he wanted to be at the second week of playoffs and say he was there. He said it with a guilt that didn’t suit him and a hope that didn’t either, and Denise put her hand on his forearm and told him to drive like a man who had more to do than impress anyone, and he looked at her like he might cry in a church lot and then didn’t. On the way home, they stopped for gas, and at the pump next to them a man in a cap watched Art like he had recognized him and decided not to wave. The man’s face had the tiredness of a person who had saved up for a boat and bought one and then had to sell it to pay for his father’s hospital bed. Art swallowed a stupid taste in his mouth and then chewed gum because he refused to let his body do drama when it was tired.

Monday morning Rhea sent him a picture from some marina where the water wore a slick like it had dressed up for a photograph. She had her hands in her pockets and a smudge of something on her cheek and the caption said, I learned to heave-to, like she’d said she had learned to tie her shoes in the wind. He Googled it in the hallway outside economics where a teacher would never notice a small rebellion and read about turning a boat just so, about slowing, about making your own stillness in a moving world, and he grinned at his phone in a way that made Deon elbow him and ask if he was reading a love poem and he said, Yes, as a matter of fact, and Deon said, “Gross,” and then, “Also, proud.”

The week stretched toward Friday like someone pulling taffy. Coach talked less and made them hit more, a kindness disguised as violence. Harley started wearing a different wristband with plays that had names that made the boys feel funny—smoke, sugar, sail, stick—and he took to calling stick when Art saw something he liked in the safety’s blink. Ms. Faircloth handed him a manila envelope with two copies of something that wanted a signature and said she had called a woman named Bernice at a school in state and told her the only thing she had to say about him was that he did not make her feel like she was being lied to, and if that didn’t get him a scholarship, she was going to stop doing this and sell produce. Denise went to the store for more detergent and came back with two cheap towels and a plant like a pine that she set on the table and said, “He can watch us breathe,” and Mia asked if this was the kind of plant you apologized to when you did the dishes at midnight, and Denise said of course, it was a pine.

Their second playoff game was away, down near where the land gave up on being north. They rode the bus past dead cotton fields that looked like someone had torn open the earth’s pillows and couldn’t find the case. The boys fell asleep or made up songs or stared out the window like the screen saver on their brains had come on. Coach walked the aisle slow like a man on a slow-moving boat and put his hand on shoulders without saying anything because touch traveled better than speech at sixty miles an hour. Art sat with Deon and they shared a bag of chips that tasted like dirt pretending to be barbecue and they argued about who deserved the newer cleats and then gave the bag to the freshman who had been assigned to carry the kicking tee around like a squire.

When they got to the stadium, it looked like someone had borrowed a college’s idea of one, all brick and a scoreboard that wanted to sell you insurance while you cried. The crowd was larger in the way other towns’ crowds sometimes were, louder, not because their voices were better but because they had practice. They announced the visiting team like a caveat and the home team like a choir. Art taped, breathed, found the little lee inside his ribs and stood in it, then stepped out. On the field the grass tried to be good and failed, slipping because the day had lost its nerve, and he took shorter steps because the place demanded a different foot.

They fell behind early because their defense forgot the way to the ground and then remembered, and when the offense got the ball, Harley looked over and his eyes did that rapid calculation Art had learned to trust. They ran two attacks at the boundary to see if it would collapse and then hit a slant because it always does if you make a man believe you are stubborn. Art took a hit in the shoulder that would show up in the morning and held on to the ball like it had asked him not to embarrass it. The second quarter became a math class—down and distance and short gains and pain you broke into fractions. At halftime, in a room that smelled like a thousand boys’ failures, Coach closed his eyes for a second like he was praying only to the part of his mind that liked truth, then opened them and said the same thing he had said all month: the third quarter was theirs if they decided to eat it. They did, or it let them, and by the fourth they were one score up and the air in Art’s chest had decided to trust him.

On a third and medium in the last two minutes a boy called a timeout his coach didn’t want, which is a mistake that belongs to you forever. It gave Art time to retape his right shoe and to look up into bleachers where faces were the size of coins and not look for one face that wasn’t there. He checked the bowline by touch once, not because it needed it but because he needed it. The play called was a shallow cross where he had to run through the space where grown men like to tackle boys because it is legal. He ran it clean. He caught and did not turn up immediately because the safety had taken the right angle and wanted to punish him for it. He took the hit and then he did a thing he had been practicing all week with cones and breath—he sat down hard like a man who remembers that getting up is his choice. The clock ran. The ref waved his arms. The other coach ate his hat in a way only he could taste. They took three knees and then one more because Harley liked the symmetry.

On the bus home, boys slept hard with mouths open because pride makes you tired. Coach put his head back and allowed himself one minute of letting the noise pass through him without converting it into a lesson. Art took out his phone and there was a photo sent at nine fifteen, a square of ocean that even in a picture moved, and a piece of rope in the foreground like a casual wrist, and the caption said: Heave-to is laying low with purpose. He sent back a picture out the bus window of a darkness cut by streetlights and wrote: Found my lee between numbers, and she wrote: You’re speaking the language now, which made him smile into a dark filled with roadside billboards that promised cars, lawyers, forgiveness.

They got back to the school at a time when the only cars in the lot belonged to the night custodians and the boy whose mother worked the graveyard shift. The air had a bite that felt personal and they laughed at nothing in the way you do when the night has been kind enough not to show you your limits. Denise sat in the car with the heat on and a thermos by her knee and when he opened the door she handed him a cinnamon roll the size of his palm and said, “I brought this to see whether you remembered you have a mouth,” and he hugged her around the shoulders with one arm and let himself sink into her neck for one second without pretending he was too old to. At home he put the shackle on the nightstand and left it there on purpose and slept without dreaming because the body sometimes gives you a night off when you’ve listened to it.

Monday after that, Ms. Faircloth called him into her office and made him sit in the chair that spun and refused to, and told him another envelope had landed and if he was going to make a decision he could make it in pieces and he didn’t have to do it in the dramatic way boys in movies did with hats and tears. He nodded and looked at a poster on her wall of a mountain that had been telling people to hang in there since her first year at the job. She walked him through not just the glamour of letters but the arithmetic of classes he would need and the reality of being a person in a place where his name would be said and then misspelled and then sold. When he left, his head felt less like a balloon and more like a thing with walls. He liked it better that way.

He went to the river after last bell alone, the path more brown now, the trees resigned. He sat on Ernie’s bench and counted the seconds between cars passing on the other side of the water and thought about all the names for the same wind. He thought about his father’s text, and how the phone had made it into an object he could sit next to and not climb inside of, how the word proud could make a man angry if he let it, how he had decided not to let it that morning and maybe that counted. He tied the bowline with the rope he kept in his pocket now like a man who had accepted he might become the kind of person who carries rope for comfort. He undid it and tied it again, and when he looked up he saw a man teaching a kid to fish badly and loved them both for the failing and the try.

On the way home the sky in the west became the kind of color people in this town took pictures of and put on the internet so they could show their relatives in Ohio that life here had a little glamour. He laughed for no reason in the car and then found a reason when he thought of Deon’s auntie learning to say state like it was a new dish. He turned onto Magnolia Glade and the porch light flicked on because he had fixed it to do that. He walked up the path and the house took him the way a house does when no one is mad at anyone for being late. He stood in the kitchen with Denise and Mia and Ray and he let the noise be the noise, and he felt, inside his ribs, something he had been practicing, a small bend in the wind, a place to tie the line without hurry, and if he had been a boy who said everything out loud, he would have said, I made it. Instead he took the chili off the stove, set it on a trivet because Denise believed in treating tables with respect, and sat down at the wobbly-legged table that had held them all and would, if cared for, hold them tomorrow.
