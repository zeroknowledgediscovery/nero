In Naas, where the canal trains the wind into a thin silver whistle and the roundabout lights blink like grounded stars, a fairy named Nicolas kept a nest in the elbow of an old ash tree. The ash leaned into a field that was not a field anymore but the backs of three new houses and a narrow path trodden by bicycles and schoolbags. The old hedgerow had not been fully ripped up when the estates came, and so the hawthorn and ash pressed themselves into a crooked barricade, muttering in leaves, remembering cows. The tree stretched out one black arm over the concrete, and in the crook of that arm Nicolas had set moss, fox hair, a cracked egg cup for a wash basin, and a small blue bead she had once dislodged from a magpie's mouth.

When she folded her wings they were the smoky color water gets when it remembers peat. When she unfolded them, they hummed without needing to, and smelled faintly of nettle, which made human noses itch. She could pass as a girl if she wanted and often did, with a faded jumper and a skirt she had scavenged, her wings tucked so flat into her shoulder blades that even the most nervous dog would not whine. It is not true—at least, not entirely—that fairies have to be small. Nicolas was as tall as a girl who could have gone to the secondary school by the canal, if anyone had insisted. But no one insisted. No one knew.

She knew the lanes of Naas in the way a river knows its banks. The early stillness of Poplar Square before the bakery opened. The sloping green called The Moat where boys sometimes rolled, and where an old body lay under the grass telling stories to the rain. The dark-iron smell at the racecourse when horses breathed and everything large and beautiful shivered. The sound of the N7 humming far to the east like a giant asleep with a bad dream. She had been here a long while, longer than the houses that sprouted and circled and called themselves estates with birds' names, saints' names, Irish words pronounced with embarrassed mouths.

The neighbor. That's where a story turns. He lived in the last of the three new houses, the one with the damp problem that paint couldn't solve. A back garden the size of a pocket, a shed with a door that swelled in wet weather and had to be shouldered open. His name was Eoghan but his mother spelled it for the postman on brown envelopes: Owen. He had a bicycle the color of indifference and a habit of holding bolts in his mouth while he searched. He wasn't poor in the way old men describe from their childhoods, with shoes made of wishes, but money came into that house and heard the racket and wanted to leave again quickly. His father drove a van and then didn't, for a while, and then did again. His mother sang along to the radio like it had been invented to be a mirror.

Nicolas saw Owen first in June, after a rain that had made her wings heavy and her bones light. He was in the little wedge of garden, sitting on a bucket, his fingers trying to coax a chain back onto a sprocket. The afternoon tried to be bright and gave up halfway. He swore softly, not the words but the shape of them, and he looked like he did not know who he was swearing to. Nicolas climbed down from the ash and stood behind the hedgerow, her feet feeling each root as a familiar knuckle. She reached through the hawthorn, careful with the thorns, and took the loose chain in one hand, the wheel in the other.

"You're doing it wrong," she said. Her voice had been muffled with tree-sap and sleepiness all day, and when she spoke, it sounded like the first few notes of a whistle finding its tune.

Owen didn't start. He didn't do that human thing of turning the entire body in panic, or the other human thing of pretending he had expected a stranger. He looked up with his chin first, keeping his fingers where they were. He had pale scars on his knuckles that looked like he'd fought with a cat and lost.

"Am I? There's only the one way," he said, half a smile coming because he couldn't help himself. He put the bolt he'd been holding between his lips and said something that might have been "Go on so," which came out as the grunt of a boy with a bolt in his mouth.

She slid the chain back with a click and a slick smear of oil that marked her thumb like a small moon. She turned the pedal with one finger, almost unseen, and the chain took the sprocket as if the two had always been lovers.

Owen took the bolt out of his mouth. "Well," he said. "Are you one of the Monread girls?"

"No," she said. "Nicolas."

He cocked his head. "That's a boy's."

"It was my father's. He liked the way it moved in the mouth. Nico-las," she said, tasting it herself. The name felt like a river stone warmed by the hand.

"You're not from anywhere near here, are you," he said, and made it a statement to be polite.

"I'm from Naas," she said, and then realized that this was, in the simplest kind of way, the truth. She gestured vaguely to the hedge and the sky. "From here."

He nodded like that made all the sense in the world. He wiped his hands on his jeans and left two oil handprints like wings. "I'm Owen. You know that now. D'you want a Tayto?"

She did. Salt and vinegar crisp that made the mouth sting, even a fairy's mouth. She slid through the hedge and sat on the other bucket. The oil smell lifted and slid away and the air smelled like cut grass and the slick plastic of a paddling pool that had never held enough water to be honest.

He told her that the chain had come off because he didn't know what he was at. She didn't correct him because she liked the way the words fell. He asked her if she went to school anywhere. That was always the hard question, the likely one, the one that had stung in other mouths.

"I used to," she said, and let the lie stand a moment. Used to, as in, once, two hundred years ago or never, depending on which map you held. "Didn't suit me."

"Same," he said. "The head of year says I can come back when I'm ready, but I think she means when I'm less me. My mother says I'll be grand. My father," he said, and his voice put on a coat, "my father says things are what you make them or else they make you. The heaviest thing in this house is a phrase he's put down."

She didn't laugh at that because it was not funny. She looked past him at the windows that had seen too much television.

"Where do you go in the day, then?" he said.

Nicolas thought about the canal path where the reeds ticked against one another like old women, and the mews lanes where cats wrote letters in smell, and the floating softness under the ash. "Out," she said. "Names are little cages."

He grinned. He had a chipped front tooth that made the grin less like a brochure and more like a person. "Ah, you're one of those."

"One of which."

"The ones who say everything like it's poetry so if it all goes wrong you can say it never was meant to be normal."

"I am not anything like that," she said, and then she laughed because perhaps she was. He laughed too, and in that moment the sting of the salt and vinegar was the whole world.

They found each other by accident and sometimes by plan. Owen learned that the ash tree held a nest the size of a dream, and he respected it the way he respected the old men who sat on benches and told you they used to be something. He didn't climb without asking. He didn't peer into the nest. He brought her objects: a button shaped like a fox, the rubber end from a pencil, a penny polished by somebody's pocket. She let him hold the bead that had been in the magpie's mouth and watched how he closed his fingers around it, cautious as if the bead might bite.

In late evenings they walked the canal path. Nicolas's feet made no sound in the damp places, and in the dry places they sounded like a whisper remembering. He pushed the bicycle with the heel of his hand. Once a swan came at them, head low, wings in a deep curve like a saint's halo—if saints were furious. Nicolas held Owen by the back of his shirt and the swan remembered itself, which is to say it was satisfied that they were afraid. She liked the cool smell of the water, the black-blue shade where bream turned and turned like no thought ever stopped, only changed direction. She knew the names of weeds in a way that wasn't quite names, and he knew the names of footballers, and both seemed equally ridiculous and necessary.

"Do you live with your... with anyone," he asked, one night when the canal looked like a road to somewhere else and the moon had slid halfway under a cloud.

"People," she said, quickly. "Sometimes. We keep each other at arms. It's a thing with us. Very intimate, keeping people at arms."

"You're very strange."

"I know," she said. It didn't hurt her to hear it from him. Other times, words like that had made her feel like a button with no coat.

"Your family from around here?"

"They're from under and over. The hawthorn. The ash. The little places you don't look at when you look. Don't ask me to map it because it doesn't agree with yours." She touched his sleeve. "Do you know how long I've been here?"

"A while?"

"A while," she agreed. She rarely said times, because times were traps. But there had been a winter when horses with wooden bones had pulled coal along the canal, twitching in the cold, and she had watched boys in caps run and run; there had been a spring when every hedgerow hawthorn had been covered in prayers tied to a branch.

"You talk like you're old as the Moat," he said. "Maybe you are. Maybe you're just a girl with a funny way."

"Maybe," she said. She tucked something unsaid into the ditch and left it there.

At first he didn't ask what she was. Humans are the only animals who do this, she had learned: needing to know everything's name, so they can think the name and touch it with the mind. But Owen was careful with that hunger. He let it come and go. He told her about his mother’s shift at the supermarket, the way she came home smelling of grapes and cash receipts; about his father’s van, about the fines that had three zeros and no patience; about wanting, sometimes, to be the kind of person who knew how to want without hating the wanting. He told her he'd had a dog named Latch who had been too clever to be a dog, and who had been hit by a car one night because he was trying to do something opposable.

She told him that once there had been a well near the Jigginstown ruins where women tied ribbons and whispered at the stone, and that she had lain under the stone listening like a letterbox when the postman is late. She told him there was a hare who lived in the fields near the racecourse who knew seven words of a human tongue and chose never to say them because of the trouble words brought. She told him that the ash tree wasn't her tree in any sense that mattered, and yet it was the place she returned to like a sentence returns to the full stop.

"Do you believe in fairies?" he asked finally, almost laughing because the question came out like a dare he'd lost.

"I don't know," she said. "What would it mean, to believe. If you see a swan, and you tell yourself it's a man in a swan suit, do you believe in men or swans? And what did you stop believing in, to make room?"

"Ah now," he said, delighted, terrible. "Say yes or no."

She looked at him with her head tipped and he felt it, the tilt like a lever pulling his ribs apart in a good way. "Yes," she said. "I believe in people who are people who are also more. I believe in women who are crows when the moment asks for black feathers. I believe in old men who can hold back the rain by crossing two fingers. I believe that Naas is a town sitting on a town, and both of them are the real one. I believe you think you are ordinary and it makes you dangerous."

"I'll take it," he said, as if she had handed him a loaf of bread.

They never kissed in that first summer. There was the way her eyes moved when he spoke, slow, like she was untying him; there was the way he didn't touch her unless she touched him first; there was the way they stood after saying goodbye for a long minute, neither of them leaving, like people deciding who would be brave enough to turn and go. Those things did not require kissing. They were their own accuracy.

Only once did she show him her wings. It was a night of thick heat and unmoving leaves, the kind that makes the body impatient with even its own skin. Thunder swelled but refused to fall. Nicolas climbed the ash and sat in the crook of its elbow and felt the air pressing and pressing. Owen stood below, his hands in his pockets as if he was holding something small that would boil away if he let it into the light. "There's a storm and it won't storm," he said, annoyed at the weather like it was a person who had failed to show up.

She unfolded the wings and let them lift her just enough that her feet left the bark. They arched out like two shadows deciding to be themselves. They weren't bright. None of what is old and true is bright. They were the color of a river that has thought of sea. The air moved. The ash leaves trembled.

Owen stared and then put his hand slowly to his chest in a gesture he hadn't learned anywhere, an old one, the kind that belongs to sailors and the devout. He was not devout. He was not familiar with boats. The thunder cracked open like a rotten fruit and the rain came down with relief. Nicolas hovered in the curtain of water, laughing, and her hair stuck to her face in dark wires.

"You're—" he began, and then he closed his mouth on the word.

"I am," she agreed, landing, folding. "I am a thing you think is a story. I'm sorry to be so boring as to be true."

"It's not boring," he said, fiercely. "It's as if someone switched on a light I didn't know I had. I don't know how I'm supposed to hold it and still go to the shop for milk."

"You go to the shop for milk," she said. "And you hold it."

He went. He came back with milk and a pack of biscuits because ordinary is not the enemy of wonder.

It might have been simple, if the world had left them awhile. But worlds never do. People saw Owen standing on the canal path at odd hours and made up stories that were less interesting than the truth. His mother said, "Who is she then?" and meant someone with hair, not someone with wings. He said, "Nicolas," and she said, "Like the name," and didn't push. His father met him in the doorway once, late, and said, "Your face has ivy on it," and Owen reached up, surprised, and pulled a leaf of ivy from his hair and didn't know whether to be chastened or smug.

The first pressure came from the stables, which is a fine sentence on its own but it means nothing until you know that near Naas is Punchestown, and near Naas is a dozen fields where the ground is hooved into memory. Horses bring people, and those people bring money, and the money brings other people with the desire to stand near money to see if any of it changes its mind. Owen had always watched horses with a longing that made him embarrassed. They were too big to want, horses, but he wanted.

It was late August. The town had been full all day: small jockeys, large owners, voices with new vowels. Owen had spent an afternoon helping a man fix a generator that hummed like a trapped thing, and for once he was paid in cash and flattery. The man introduced him to a girl called Orlaith whose jacket had buttons that looked like they could tell stories. Her hair was the same color as the pips of an apple. Owen felt suddenly aware of the oil under his nails and the way his accent went for a walk when he was nervous.

"Nicolas," he said later, sitting on the path by the ash, and she came upside down to look at him, her hair reaching toward the ground like a second person.

"What," she said, amused. "You have a voice like a kettle. Boiling and not yet."

"I met some people," he said. "Very... horsey."

"Horses are honest," she said, and thought of the hare who wouldn't speak.

"They asked would I come out to the yard. Help with a thing. There's work. They're all," he groped for the word, "polished. And they talk about Cheltenham like it's the old country. And they asked me like they meant it."

"Good," she said, simple, bracing herself against the thread that ran from him to everything else, as if it might be tugged.

"Would you," he said, faltered, stuck, "would you come?"

Nicolas hung there and considered all the ways she could fold herself into that world and all the ways she would fail to fold. She had once lived in a big house for a month one winter, when the price of coal had meant a family could not keep all the rooms warm. She had sleeped under the piano. She had met ladies who talked with their teeth showing all the time, like they were smiling at a joke they had told themselves and it had gone stale. She had watched the way money took the shape of everything it touched. But this was not that. This was a yard with hay and dung and the slap of leather. She could be in a yard like that. She could be a shadow in the corner that nobody minded, a second smell behind the smell of horse sweat.

"I can come," she said. "I'll be very good and not change into anything alarming."

He laughed, grateful. "Don't. They're delicate, the lot of them, and they pretend they aren't. Will you be all right, though? It's a different kind of... you know. People. They'll look through you until they decide not to, and then they'll never stop looking."

"I can be air," she said. "I've done it before. I can be a wall you lean on and forget to thank."

"Don't," he said, almost angry, which was new and not dreadful. "Don't be a wall. You're a person."

"I'm a person and a wall," she said, lightly, because heaviness would make him buckle. "I'm a door. I'm the hinge. I'm a small grammar mistake that makes the sentence honest."

He smiled then, but he rubbed his thumb like there was oil there that he couldn't get rid of. "Come tomorrow so."

She came. She walked through the yard with him as if she belonged there, which is the simplest spell in the world and the hardest to pull off. She half-closed her eyes to the way eyes followed them. It was Orlaith who greeted Owen first, her hand catching his elbow in a motion so practiced it could not be accidental. Orlaith was pretty in the way a sleek horse is pretty: you admire but you think of how fast it could throw you. She looked at Nicolas for a long second, a small assessment, not unkind but not kind.

"You're the mechanic," Orlaith said to Owen, and the word did a little dance in the air, an English step with money's shoes on. "We need the yard lights at the back. They've gone feral again."

"I'm not," Owen said, polite, "I'm not exactly—"

"You're a genius," Orlaith said, and laughed, and took him off, and flushed around him the way tidy girls flush when they admire a stray dog that will bite them only later. Nicolas watched them go. She stood still enough to be a shadow. Stable boys and stable men and women with hair clipped back in military fashions walked by her, not seeing or seeing and pretending not to. A horse turned its head and looked at her with its long-lashed eye, and she bowed to it, because why wouldn't you.

"You with them?" a woman said beside her, and Nicolas started because the woman had come up soft as a thought. She had arms crossed and a face that had been windburned to sense. Her hair was gray in the front like a declaration. Her boots looked like she had worked in them and never kicked anyone with them unless they deserved it.

"I am," Nicolas said. "Sort of."

"Who are you then," the woman asked, not unkind, not kind, the way a gate asks you if you have hands.

"Nicolas."

"Louise," the woman said. "Don't let them make you stand. If you want tea, make tea. There's no one here important enough to mind."

Nicolas wanted to kiss the woman's hand for saying that and did not, because this was not that kind of story, not yet. She went to the kettle and made tea like she had worked there three years. She put the mug in Owen's hand when he came out, the grease of the generator shining on his wrist. He said "Thanks," as if he had earned something.

After that, there were days that looked like this: the yard, the tea, the horses whose breath made clouds in the mornings. Owen seemed taller, somehow, even though he was the same size. He moved as if he had been set a project by someone who liked him and wanted him to do well, which is a love that looks exactly like work. Orlaith laughed with him, not in loops but straight lines. He came home with stories that had proper nouns and numbers and the thrill of belonging.

He still came to the ash. He still brought penny buttons and the odd sweet and the things he didn't tell anyone else, which he thought were secrets and which were simply the parts of his life that had no slots to fit into other people's stories. He still said goodnight twice and then again, because he couldn't leave. But there were moments—a glance at his phone, a "Tomorrow I'm wrecked but the day after maybe," a tiredness that didn't want to be seen—that stung her like a nettle through thin skin. She told herself that she loved him in a way that didn't have room for the human chaff of jealousy and wanting. She told herself that her kind loved without ownership, without the little claws. She told herself many noble lies.

Autumn came in like a horse who knows the way. The leaves changed like they had decided to die flamboyantly. The canal held the sky and pretended not to be proud of it. Nicolas woke in the night under the ash and heard men laughing where there should have been silence, saw the shards of green glass glittering like a constellation on the path, smelled piss in the hedgerow and anger in the air. She lay very still and named each smell until the world went back to something she could hold.

Owen biked in the mornings to the yard and came back in the evenings with his shoulders squared in a way that said both "I am somebody" and "I am tired." He told her about a horse named Night Fax who wouldn't let anyone touch his ears. He told her about Orlaith's mother who had opinions that came with hand gestures. He told her about a man who said "class" to mean two different things and didn't know he was doing it.

"They're good people," he said, drowsy, leaning against the ash with his eyes closed. "They work hard. And they see me. You know. They look and don't flinch."

"I have never flinched," she said, lying down beside him in the leaves. Her wings pressed between her shoulder blades. "Even before I knew enough to know you."

"I know," he said, and his hand found hers without looking. "You were the first door that wasn't a door that closed when I touched it."

"What are doors for," she said.

"For letting in," he answered, and slept without going home.

Rumors began to float like thistledown, and human mouths caught them. Nicolas heard them because she could hear what a blackbird said to a lamppost and what the wind said to a stub of wall. She heard it in the kitchen of the yard when someone thought the kettle was too loud to hear through. "That lad Owen," someone said, with fondness and appraisal mixed in the same spoon. "He could be something if he keeps his head." "Doesn't have to go back to that," another said, and meant the estate, the small garden, the oil handprints on jeans. Nicolas listened and the words crawled on her skin, very polite, very interested, eating a little as they went.

Sometimes she came home to the ash and it wasn't enough. The nest seemed small. A rainstorm and the drones of the road seemed like the only vocabulary the night had and she wanted a new language. She flew in small tight circles under the leaves until her wings trembled, and the trembling made a sound like a hidden wound. She told herself that the newness in Owen's life was not a removal but an addition, the way you put a new shelf on a wall and nothing falls. She told herself she was not anything that could fall. And yet.

The first real cold of the year took the town in its fist and squeezed. The edges of the canal saw white. Nicolas woke with her hair stiff in places where she'd breathed it wet in the night. She flew in a little dart to warm herself and the air hurt her cheeks. The ash creaked. She went looking for warmth the way a fox does, clever and shameless. She found it in the yard, in the kettle, in the horse breath and the steam that rose from backs. She found it in Owen's grin when he saw her, like the grin had been waiting behind his face all morning and now someone had let it out to run.

Orlaith was there with a scarf like a banner. She said, "Nic—Nicolas, isn't it? We're having people Friday. Come, sure. There's a fiddler and some bad wine. We'll pretend the bad wine is good and that'll be half the fun."

Nicolas blinked. People had invited her places. People had invited her out of places. She was in the habit of saying yes to invitations as if she were swearing an oath, and then later failing to arrive. "Friday," she said. "Yes."

Owen looked at her sideways, proud and something else. Louise, the woman with the winded face, said nothing and watched everything, and Nicolas felt, briefly, all right.

On Friday, Nicolas tried to wear clothes that folded her wings without choking her. She tried to lose the smell of leaf and soil and found she preferred to carry it in with her like a secret. The yard was louder, not with horses but with people who stood near horses and took their courage from the nearness. The fiddler was indeed bad. The wine was worse and happier. Orlaith’s voice flashed in and out of rooms. Nicolas stood in a doorway and felt relevant and irrelevant, a paradox that gets you through many human nights.

Owen moved through sockets of conversation as if they were the holes where wires go. People laughed and put their hands on his shoulder. Orlaith laughed and put her hand lower, on the top of his back, and Nicolas watched the small moment and felt her stomach clench like a hand catching at a falling jar that still might break. Owen saw her seeing and crossed the room to her and said, too quickly, "Are you all right?"

"Of course," she said. She meant it. She lied. Both.

The fiddler found the right tune and all at once everyone was moving like they had remembered their knees. Nicolas danced for a bit, feet quick, an old step she'd learned from a woman who wore a red coat and whose laugh had felt like a ladder against a house. Owen watched and then looked away, because to watch too long would make his heart show its palm. Orlaith watched and then clapped, genuine and not gracious. Louise watched and did not smile and Nicolas loved her for it.

Later, outside, when the air had the exact temperature of a lost breath, Owen leaned against the wall and said, "You're a miracle."

"You keep saying it like it makes it less likely to be untrue," she said.

"Maybe I'm reminding myself so I don't go soft and stupid."

"Go soft," she said. "Go stupid. That's where the good things sit and wait."

He stepped closer then, a little, and his hand lifted and then did not touch her face, because there were people in the yard behind him and because the night had ears. Their breath made ghosts. She could feel the warmth of him lifting off like a small sun.

"Tomorrow," he said. "We'll walk. I haven't had the canal in weeks. It will be jealous of me."

"Tomorrow," she said, and knew, with the kind of certainty that doesn't comfort, that tomorrow would be a more crowded place than they thought. She touched his hand gently and felt all the little scars on his knuckles.

As she turned to go, she heard Orlaith calling to someone, a bright fearless sound that wanted the world and expected to be granted. Nicolas saw the curve of Orlaith's neck and felt an ache like hunger. Not for Orlaith, not exactly, but for that kind of uncalculated wanting that money teaches you and protects you from and makes you pay for twice. She had wanted in as many languages as there were hedges around Naas. She had wanted slow, she had wanted quick, she had wanted until her wings needed new feathers. She wanted now, and the wanting made her generous and cruel.

Nicolas walked home under a thin moon, past a group of teenagers with breath like cider and bravado, past the church where a janitor locked the door as if he were closing a box with a dangerous thing inside, past the canal which lay like glass ready to be written on by frost in the morning. She climbed the ash. She lay in her nest and looked up through the fork of the branches and saw the universe pretending to be small. She closed her eyes and let the sound of the world's heart be enough.

It was, until it wasn't.The morning put on its thin white shirt of frost and went about its business. The canal was sheeted at the edges, a milky lip the thickness of a fingernail, and each reed wore a sugar of cold that would not sweeten anything. Nicolas woke with her cheek stiff where her breath had frozen and melted and frozen again. She shook her hair and little flakes fell onto the moss of her nest and disappeared as if ashamed. Down in the pocket garden there was a sound of the shed door being persuaded by a shoulder, a set of curses that had good manners and bad timing, and then Owen came into the cold with his hands shoved in his pockets as if he might warm the weather if he scowled enough.

They met on the path where the ash bent over like a parent leaning to hear. Nicolas dropped from the crook without fuss and landed like a thought that had been waiting for a mouth. Owen was grinning and trying not to show he was grinning, because people had taught him that you never hand the world your soft underbelly even if the world is your friend. They set off side by side, her feet making the old whisper and his tyres clicking over a bottle cap so it sang for a few seconds and then gave up. The air was a bracing that couldn't stop itself telling you how alive you were, and their breath reached toward each other and didn't quite meet.

"Everyone at the yard was ruined this morning," he said, pleased in the way a person is pleased when a thing is hard but they are harder. "And Night Fax let me touch his ear. Just left me. I thought he might take the hand off and swallow it for the spite, but he didn't. He blinked like I'd told him a secret."

"Maybe you did," she said, and watched the water because the water was doing that thing where it told the sky's future in a broken script. "Horses know when they're loved in a language they don't have to learn. It's rare enough in people."

"You're very kind to us," he said, and then he bumped her shoulder with the heel of his hand because the kindness was a coat he couldn't wear without tugging at the hem. They walked a while not talking, which for them was not quiet but a shared translation. Runners came past with faces like saints in paintings, fierce and suffering, wearing bright warning-colour shirts that told the day to move. A woman passed with a pushchair and a dog that was trying to be a friend to the pushchair while also considering whether the canal might have a duck it could invite to dinner. The canal ducks laughed at all of them because ducks are rude and they can be.

"Tomorrow is jealous," he said, remembering himself and their promise, and then he stopped because the path ahead of them was indeed crowded, but not in a way his mouth had a word for. Two men in high-vis jackets were setting a tripod with a camera perched on it like a long-armed bird that ate distances. A third man held a measuring pole and looked as if measurements had carved him out of something softer and then forgotten to finish the job. There were notepads and a clipboard and a roll of red-and-white tape that said Danger without really meaning it. They stood where the path pinched and the ash reached out over the concrete with its black elbow and its hand of leafless finger-bones. The men were talking not to each other but to the air, the way people do when a decision has been made elsewhere and they have to pretend this is where it lives.

"Morning," Owen said, because he was good and couldn't help it. "What are you at, then?" He made it friendly because the world is easier when the door is opened and not kicked in.

"Survey," the tallest man said, in an accent that wore Liffey water and city boots. "Path widening, safety works. It's busy here of a morning and of an evening, and there's been incidents. We'll sort it."

"Sort it how," Nicolas said, and her voice made the word sort stretch as if it could be coaxed to mean something better than it did. She stood with the ash above and behind her, so that her shadow was crosshatched with twig and twig again. The high-vis men looked at her the way men sometimes look at things that don't come with a reasonable invoice, and then looked at the tree like it would be rude to talk to the girl and not the bigger thing.

"Trim this fella back," said the one with the pole, tapping the bark as if it was a cow asleep in a byre and not an old body that had kept itself upright through years of wind. "He’s in the way. He wants encouraging, this path. We’ll make a left and a right of it and straight as a sermon. There’ll be bollards, lighting, the whole thing."

"Trim," Nicolas said, and smiled the way some people smile at funerals when they know the person in the coffin had asked to be burned. "Trim is a nice word you put on a chair and eat a biscuit on. Trim is a lady with a hedge-clipper. What you mean is cut, and what you cut you take, and what you take doesn't sit back down where it was."

"Here now," said the city water man, conciliatory, because men in high-vis are taught to be kind until it's time to be the other thing. "We put notices. It’s all above board. It's safety, love. We had a man on a bike take the bark off his shoulder, he said, and nearly the skin. You wouldn’t want that."

Owen's fingers had gone into his pocket and found nothing to busy themselves with. He traced the rim of his phone the way some people might trace the lip of a glass, trying to drink what wasn't in it. "How much," he asked, practical because he had to be something. "How much of it, like." He gestured at the ash with the start of a sweep that became instead a rub of his eyebrow.

"We'll be tidy," said the measuring pole, which is the same thing as saying nothing at all. "We'll be in and out. There'll be new lights. Will we say sorry now or later and you can decide which you liked better."

Nicolas looked at the red-and-white tape as if it might be a snake, and then at the ash. She reached up and touched the bark with two fingers, a quick kiss of a gesture, not wanting to make a ceremony where there might yet be an accident to be prevented. She could taste the ash on her tongue because her speech and the tree's skin were neighbors. "You'll post a notice," she said, and made it sound like a spell, which made the men uncomfortable because they were superstitious in the way all men are when the words fall sideways. "And people will have a week to pretend this isn't decided. Then you'll come with your van and your tidy."

"A fortnight," said the city man, pleased to be able to offer the world a bargain. "And safety barriers. And flags."

They all stood in the cold and made that shape of bodies that is agreement without consent. The men packed, shoulders up against the hurts of the air, and walked away with the tripod over a shoulder like a rifle made to measure. Owen watched them go and his mouth did a thing like it took a step and came back. He looked up at the ash and his face wore a child's expression the body has to grow a man around to protect it. He looked at Nicolas because she was the person he looked at when there wasn't anything else to do, and because in his body there was an old thought that said the right person can change the scale of a day by a quarter turn.

"We'll do something," he said, helpless and brave. "We'll—write letters, like. You'll know who to write to, will you. You'll have a person. You always have a person."

"I have people," she said, and smiled because it was too late to hide the fact. "But my people aren't the ones with clipboards. They are the ones who never learned to write because the writing goes where it wants and tells on you when you need it to lie. There are others," she said, and thought of the woman at the yard with the wind's face and the girls who knew where petitions went to be folded and unfolded. "There are people who stand in front of vans and are very reasonable until they are not. But this is a small path. This is a small ash. It is not the last or the first, and the men will come anyway. I am telling you this so when the shame of not winning comes, you won't let it eat everything else."

"I hate that," he said, immediately, because he hated being prepared to lose more than he hated losing when it took him by surprise. "I hate it when the thing doesn't even give you the dignity of being a tragedy. It just goes on and you are meant to congratulate yourself for not crying the whole time."

"Then don't congratulate yourself," she said, and she poked him in the upper arm, which was a new intimacy that felt to both of them like something they'd been practicing for months. "Just don't cry the whole time for free. Charge it to the next life and get interest."

They turned back because the day had to be walked even if the end of it was not where they'd hoped. Owen wheeled the bicycle with excessive care as if he might bruise the path, and Nicolas walked on the grass that remembered cows and which had not yet been taught to forget them. They talked about everything other than the ash for a while because there is a technique to loving a thing that might be taken, and one of the oldest parts of it is to look aside until you can look straight. He told her about Night Fax allowing his ear to be held as if he'd been paid to behave and had negotiated the price. She told him about a fox she'd watched in the white morning, stepping as if each place it put a foot had asked for permission and been given none.

Back at the yard later the smell of horse and cordite cold were a balm and a rasp. Louise stood with a rope coiled in her hands as if she knew a hundred knots and had tired of all but three. Nicolas went to her because she had decided in the part of herself that decides things without asking the part with the questions. "They'll cut the ash," she said, and let the word cut do half the work of the sentence.

"They will," Louise said, and it was not comfort or despair. "They cut us all the time. The head is a thing they like to take off first. It's clean that way. Will you stand, then, or will you do the other thing. There's always an other thing, if you can live with what it costs."

"I could stand until my feet are part of the concrete," Nicolas said, and in her mind she was already under the path with the old people who have no names, laying her body in the way of what comes and knowing enough to be still. "Or I could ask. There are courts. There are judges. There are old men in sheds who know how many of each tree we have and what the law thinks of them. He thinks I always have a person. He loves that I have a person. I want to be the person this time, and also I do not."

"Be both," Louise said, as if you could order that off a menu. "Stand in front of a thing and write a letter behind it and ask a councillor to make a phone call that will be ignored, and after all that you will at least have done your bit and not only because of him. Then when the saw takes the limb and the lads swear because the sap got in their sleeves, you can have your grief without the little hooks. You'll wash cups and not cry into them and think yourself noble and you will be wrong and right at the same time."

"You are no use to me," Nicolas said, and then she laughed, because this particular uselessness was the only kind she would accept. "Do you need me to be air any time soon. I can do air like a profession."

"Be a girl," Louise said, and for a second her eyes were not a yard, not a rope, but something else that had learned what to let go. "If you can. If you can't, be a gust that knocks a thing down and say you don't know how that happened."

Orlaith came past then and touched Owen in the place between shoulder and neck that Nicolas had watched the other night, the way you might demonstrate the location of a hinge. "There's a man this evening wants the generator dismantled because it squeals like a pig at market when it warms up," Orlaith said, and she made pig at market sound like an invitation to mass. "And you'll come after, will you, to mine. There are three of us and we will ruin a pizza and be proud."

"Tomorrow," Owen said, and looked at Nicolas to show he was choosing her, even as he also chose the pizza, which is a thing people do when they are trying to make a triangle behave like a line. "The canal. The ash. We'll be jealous of each other."

"And what are you," Orlaith said to Nicolas, light and dangerous the way only a person who has never thought of the price of light can be. "Are you coming to the ruination or do you float off after dark."

"I'm a floater," Nicolas said, sweet, making it sound like the kind of insult you couldn't quite bring yourself to use. "I float and I sink and in between I am unhelpfully buoyant. Eat the pizza and be a queen and ask them to bring you things. If they do not, you will know what kind of kingdom it is."

Orlaith laughed then, delighted in the way of a person who hears a tune she doesn't understand but hopes she will be credited with dancing to. She went, and Owen lifted a spanner as if lifting a salute. Nicolas touched the horse called Night Fax under the jaw where the skin went like silk over bone. He allowed it because the new morning had changed him, or because she did not use her hands in a way horses mind. She whispered something into the horse's hollow that was not an ask and not a gift, and the horse breathed out as if he'd let go of the old coin he'd been keeping at the back of his tongue.

That evening in the ash there was a paper nailed into the bark and the nail had gone home and had no intention of leaving. Nicolas took the paper by its corner and read the words, black and tidy and pretending to be open to discussion. There was a date and a time and an email that belonged to a person who would leave the job in four months for a better one with a slightly larger printer. She read it twice and then said aloud the names of the men in it, because names put out into the air don't sit comfortably when guilt comes and wants to make itself a bed. A bicycle wheel came by, and the boy on the bicycle had a scarf up to his nose, and his eyes said I am fifteen and I am invincible and I am very cold. He did not look up. The ash held its breath the way some people do when the person they are in love with leaves a room to get a drink.

The next day, which had no obligation to be kinder, gave them a council office with a glass door and a woman who wore a lanyard as if she'd been born with it. Owen had taken a shirt that had seen two interviews and a funeral, and he buttoned it all the way because his nerves liked to put their hands in a pocket and that pocket did not exist. Nicolas wore the jumpers that made her look like the girl she was passing for, and she flattened her wings so far back she felt bone talk to bone and tell it, not now. The woman at the desk said, "How can I help," in the tune of a person who had been taught this song and had learned to like it in the way you like a hymn for its rhythm if not its god. They filled a form and then another form appeared, like a rabbit brought out of a hat by a tired magician, and Nicolas wrote her name in letters that had been taught to her by a nun long gone to ground, and Owen wrote his in letters that could fix a generator.

"We'll record the objection," the woman said, not unkind and not kind. "We have a process. It will take its course. Health and safety trumps. You'll understand. Children and bikes and the like. We can't have—" She gestured at the air, and the air was kind enough not to demonstrate falling.

"If we gather signatures," Owen asked, already thinking of doors and faces and how ashamed he would be to knock on some and not others. "If we have, you know, numbers."

"It's all taken into account," the woman said, and her smile was a bowl you could drink nothing from. "You're doing the right thing. Mind yourselves on the way out, the steps are slippy."

Outside, the cold had put a crust on the morning again and it had no intention of letting anyone through to the soft. Owen looked at Nicolas as if to ask did we do it, and she looked back as if to say we did something, and in the space between those ideas a tenderness sat down and made its lap available. They walked to the bridge and leaned on it and watched a man take bread out of a bag and loft it toward ducks who pretended they were starving to be polite. "I hate that you told me to be ready to lose," he said, without heat, as if stating a rule about electricity.

"I didn't tell you to be ready to lose," she said, and took his hand because she could and because she wanted to test whether hands could be warmer together through gloves. "I told you that losing is a thing that knows your address. It comes without knocking. You don't have to put the kettle on for it. You can let it stand on the doorstep and pretend you're in the bath and can't hear."

"I'll stand it on the doorstep," he said, and then he laughed because a man across the water had slipped not on the steps but in his own thought and recovered with dignity that should have been awarded a medal. "I'll make it write its name in the book and tell it we've no room."

The days after were a loop of the three things they could do. They stood at the ash and spoke to anyone who would speak back and they were patient with the ones who said, "But don't you think the lights would be nice," in voices that made nice sound like a prayer and a threat both. They went to a meeting in a room with a carpet that remembered better shoes and they watched a councillor learn all their names and then misplace them with ceremony. They went back to the yard because even when you are trying to keep a tree from being cut you need to eat and if you do not stand near animals who do not lie by habit you begin to think the lies are oxygen. In between, little things happened in the world that added up to a sum they tried not to see. A robin started landing on the ash's lower branch and looking at Nicolas as if to say, I am not responsible for your dramas and also I might be. A boy in a hoodie kicked the red-and-white tape and said, "Hup," with admiration, as if it were a thing he'd built himself and not the ribbon on his own future. Owen's father got a job painting warehouse roofs in an estate near Sallins and came home smelling of solvents and success and didn't say thank you to anyone because he'd learned it was safer not to tell gratitude your house number. Owen's mother sang to the radio and cut articles out of the local paper about classes in the community hall where you could learn to make soup in bulk without crying.

On a Saturday that was meant to be only a Saturday, Nicolas was in the nest mending a thin place on a wing with spider-line and patience when the ash trembled not with wind but with a warning. She went still as silt and listened downwards and sideways to where the things that live under and alongside pass their news like a bowl for hands. The whisper that rose was not words but a pressure under the skin that said, move. She wrapped her jumper around her shoulders because it was a thing that comforted humans and sometimes it comforted her if she played along, and she went toward the canal, stepping in the white grass where fox had written a sentence earlier and the sentence had already blurred.

At the bend before the bridge the path had gathered a knot of people the shape a body makes in that moment before it falls asleep and resists it. There were the men from the field that was not a field, there were teenage boys who use their hands to draw circles in the air when they are trying not to punch something, there was a woman whose baby wore a hat that made it look like a tiny, offended bear. There were two Gardaí, one old enough to be polite with experience, the other young enough to be polite with ambition. Owen stood with his bicycle leaned against his knee the way a person leans on a promise and expects it to hold. He saw Nicolas and his face went through three expressions and decided on the one that said, I do not know yet if this is the story we'd like it to be.

The swan lay in the narrow of the bank, half in and half out, wings folded wrong like a bedsheet taken off by someone unfamiliar with the trick. Its neck was long in a way that necks should not be long. The white of it was not white but cream and grey and the off-colour of wet. A boy stood nearest it with his hand halfway out and his mother had captured his sleeve at the wrist and held him with a force that would become poetry later when he remembered it. The older Garda was saying, "They are vicious enough when they're hale, lads, and even gentle things will do you a harm when they're sore," and the younger was saying into his radio the numbers of their day. The ducks had gathered a polite distance away and were muttering about the inconveniences of drama. The canal water licked at the swan's feet as if asking would you not go in again because you belong.

"It's hurt on the ice," someone said, and someone else said, "A dog," and someone else said, "A fox," and someone else said, "A van," because vans have long sins in towns like these. Nicolas stepped close because she did not know the dignity of staying away, and she bent and put her hand under the place where the feathers met the skin at the breastbone, a place that in any creature tells you the truth the mouth is not ready for. The swan's eye opened, black and infinite in the way small things can be infinite if you make the mistake of looking with your insides. It saw her and it did not know her and then it did, and she felt the knowledge pass into her like cold. She kept her hand there and sang something without voice and the older Garda looked at her as if thinking of grandmothers and wells.

"Don't," Owen said quietly right behind her, not because he didn't want her to, but because the instinct of standing men in the presence of hurting things is to say don't in case it is the one word that keeps a tide back. "Do, if you can. Do if you must. But if it bites I'll break its beak across my knee and the county will have my name in its book forever."

"It will not bite me," she said, and to the swan she said nothing because it was polite to be silent when an animal was dying. She moved her hand and felt for what was broken and what was only frightened, and she found the end of a life there, waiting behind a door that had been left on the latch. Sometimes you can push it closed again and you must, and sometimes you cannot and you must not. She let her breath be slow and called, not with a mouth that could be seen, for a thing that moves like a long shadow over fields that used to be fields, and the part of the world that answers to such calls considered and then came.

It was not a procession the humans could see fully, because it would have been indecent to show all its bones. It was a sliding change in pressure, as when a storm decides to be a storm and men look up from their tasks without knowing why. It was the sound of a horse at a far gallop, the beating of air as if a very large bird had thought about flying. The hare from the racecourse ducked under the guard-rail with a movement like a thought abandoning a bad idea, and it stopped in front of Nicolas and sat, which was already wrong enough that even the teenagers stopped their hands drawing circles and let them hang. It looked at her and she looked back and a moment passed that was the size of a field and the width of an eyelash. Then the hare said, in the human tongue that it had seven words of and hated to use, "Do not spend," and then it ran like no human thought could catch it.

"Jesus Christ," the young Garda said, and then pretended he'd said nothing because the old Garda was looking at him and the old Garda had a face that said that in his day no animal spoke in public and if it had he would have offered it tea and asked for its vote. The mother looked at her boy's sleeve as if it might cure itself. Owen put his hand on the back of Nicolas's neck as if to keep her from floating away in front of anyone who would write it down.

The swan died not like a candle but like a lake freezing, slowly and in great silence that she could hear like a weight. She took her hand away because taking your hand away at the right time is a sacrament. The Gardaí made phone calls and the county sent a man with a van to lift the body with respect no matter what the jokes said later in the pub, and the ducks went back to work, and the boys moved their hands again. Owen stood very close and said, "What did it say," and she told him because there was no point being an ark for words if you would not pour them out when the ground was dry.

"Do not spend," he repeated, and his brain went at once to money because his brain always did the sensible stupid thing first. "What would we spend."

"Everything," she said, and brushed the back of her knuckles over his cheek because she could not think of what else to do. "We will want to spend everything to save something that should be saved by its own right to be. We will spend sleep, we will spend kindness, we will spend good will in the corner shop and the patience of your mother and the tightness of your father's fist and the bit of luck you were saving for a rainy day. We will spend the thing that keeps us sweet with each other. The hare says don't. The hare knows what it is to run until the heart says please."

"And we shouldn't," he said, catching his breath on the argument because he was built to wrestle with ideas that didn't have him in a headlock yet. "But if we don't, the men with the tripod will come. They will put their boots at the base of the ash and they will say, mind the roots, and then they will drive over them anyway because that's what roots are for when you're in a hurry. If we don't spend, we are miserly. If we do, we are poor. There isn't any virtue left unbroken in there."

"The old world keeps accounts on bone and light," she said, and watched the van lift the swan like it was lifting a piece of moon that had fallen off. "It doesn't care how you feel, only how you move. If we move right, maybe we will not feel wrong. I don't know. I am telling you the truth in case there is a time soon when you want to call me a liar, and then you will have to find another reason."

He laughed and then didn't, and he leaned his forehead on her shoulder for a second because it looked enough like adjusting his scarf that nobody would make a story of it until later when there was a need. They went back to the ash and there were three new signatures on the list someone had taped to the paper with the nail, and there were two names scratched out in biro because husbands had spoken to wives and the wives had said, we like lights. Nicolas looked at the column of letters and saw how much of a human a signature can hold and how much of a human it cannot. She began to make the other phone calls, the ones that go underground and sideways. She spoke to a woman called Mairead who had stood in front of a digger once with a baby in a sling and a newspaper photographer with an honest eye, and to a man called Donal who kept bees and knew the names for diseases of ash and who would come and say them with such authority it would make the high-vis men look at their boots and their boots would not comfort them.

In the evenings there was still the yard and the generator and the squeal Orlaith complained about and which Owen silenced with a trick he had made up in his head while standing in the shower forgetting to wash his hair. Orlaith came closer, not with malice, which would have been simpler, but with the generosity of a person who thinks that if a thing is good the correct behaviour is to gather around it. She said, "You're wasted there," meaning the house with the damp, and "There's a course," meaning the world that had a certificate and a job attached, and "You could come with us for Cheltenham," meaning that a ferry and a set of nights in a B&B were possible if you knew the shape of the door. Owen's head filled with horses and engines and the particular kindness men show each other when they are allowed to talk about what they are good at, and his mouth filled with apologies to Nicolas before he had said them.

"Go," she said, when he started, which was either wise or cowardly and she would later have to decide which to accuse herself of. "Go because it's a road you will regret not walking. Go because the ash will be cut or it will not be cut whether you go or whether you sit on the path and count your eyelashes. Go because you'll whisper to me about it when you come home and the whisper will be worth the not-sleep."

"I'll come home," he said, fierce, which was brave and untrue and true in some ways that mattered more than the ways that didn't. "I'll bring you, if you want. You'll sit in a field in England and laugh at the smallness of it."

"I am too old to be laughed at kindly by borders," she said, and she touched his lip with her fingertip because if she didn't touch him she would say a bigger thing. "Bring me a word the English have for a kind of rain we do not have here. Bring me the taste of a coffee you hated. Bring me a small lie and I will not mind because it will be human and I am allowed to collect them like buttons."

He nodded and then pulled her into him so quickly and simply that there was not time to tell them it wasn't wise. It was not a kiss like the books say, with breath counted and lids lowered and a description the author could write and get paid for. It was a kiss like a person finds a door in the dark and is relieved to remember they live somewhere. It went on long enough to store up a warmth they would both need, and then they were people again with their faces, and they pretended to examine the nail in the notice because pretending is a tool and deserves respect.

That night in the ash the other people came. They came the way fog comes, soft and an argument against sharp things. They came along the path and through the hedgerow and over the concrete, and some of them smiled because they'd learned it gets you places and some of them did not because they still thought the world owed them access. Nicolas rose and stood on the branch because formalities matter when you are dealing with the ones who do not care for your when. The first among them had a blue coat like the inside of a magpie's wing and hair pinned up with bone. She did not waste her beauty with cruelty because she wasn't human and didn't need to, which made her no less dangerous. Behind her a man whose eyes were the colour of horse chestnuts in water carried a lantern that held no flame and threw a light that went a little way and then turned back.

"Nicolas," said the blue-coated one, and made the syllables into a dance step that Nicolas had not learned but could not resist doing. "You've been at the river. You've been at the dead. You have touched a thing with your hand and told it to leave. You've let a boy put his mouth on yours and you've let him put his heart, which is a different thing and you know it. You have a debt that is not yet due and this is a warning sent in silk. Leave the ash. Let the men take what they think they can own. If you stay, we will count it against you the next time we need counting to be done."

"You're very free with your ledger," Nicolas said, not bowing because she would not practice for an execution. "What is it to you if the path is widened or left to learn patience. We have roads the width of two horses standing side by side and roads the width of a lie told quickly. You don't walk on them. You don't fall on them. Your feet know the fences and the fields in the dark. Why here, why me, why now."

"We are bored," said the man with the chestnut eyes, smiling like a man who knows that boredom is a blade sharp enough to cut anything you might love. "We are making a ride in a fortnight and we like the paths just so. We do not like saws. We do not like red-and-white tape. We will not be observed by a man with a tripod who sends our shadows into the council report. We will do as we like. We are telling you because you are a particular favourite of a person who should know better and because we liked you better before you allowed human words to colonise your mouth."

"Maybe I did," she said, furious in the way a still pond is furious if you lift all its leaves and show it the sky. "Maybe I put vowels in like seeds and let them make a mess on purpose. Maybe I will stand in front of a van that belongs to a man who has three children and two jobs and a heart that doesn't know where to live. Maybe I will be spent. Maybe I will not be the thing you let me be when you thought I would never have to pay rent in this century. Maybe you can count that against me and I will take the account to the old body under The Moat and see if he finds a way to balance it with a story."

The blue-coated woman leaned forward then and for a second the air smelled like peat in water and nettles crushed under a hand offered in truce. "Do not be grand," she said, kindly, which startled Nicolas into respect. "Do not make yourself a banner to wave. You will be folded around a stick and then the stick will break and you will go where the wind tells you. Be small and precise. Take a stone out of a shoe. Slip a word into a mouth. Move a tool half an inch and expect nothing. This is your lecture. You can throw it back at my head if you like. But don't say later that no one told you how to avoid being admirably destroyed."

They went without breaking. They went like mist that had decided there was a livelier field beyond the next hedge. The lantern light turned itself inward and became a thing that fed on its own belly with satisfaction. The ash shivered again because that is what an ash does when the old people have been near it. Nicolas sat down hard in the crook and lay on her side and looked at the bead that had been in the magpie's mouth and said, quietly because nobody was around to be impressed, "No," to a lot of things. She said no to being bored. She said no to being folded. She said no to the blue coat and yes to the idea of moving a tool half an inch, and she fell asleep with her face pressed into her arm and dreamed that she had a thousand small hands and that each one of them undid a bolt at exactly the right time.

The fortnight began to run even if nobody agreed to start the race. Owen's mother tore the notice of the ash from the fridge and stuck it to a tin of biscuits, because in that house biscuits were an altar everyone visited without ritual and she wanted every hand to brush the paper and take on some of its ink. His father came home two nights running not quite drunk and sat on the edge of the living-room chair as if holding himself available for judgment. He said to Owen, "This tree is not the hill," and then he said, "Do the tree anyway. Go on. Be yourself, for a change," and then he grinned and it was like a lighthouse with a bulb that had been put in too late. Orlaith practiced how to make a person feel chosen and Nicolas practiced how not to feel punished when she was not. Louise practiced looking like she had no stake in any of it and then later Nicolas saw her in the spare tack-room writing a paragraph longhand that would make a councillor feel the chill up his back that is sometimes a conscience and sometimes a draft.

On a day that was cruelly bright Nicolas went to The Moat, which is not a moat but used to be something like one if you squint at history and take pity on its need to be a circle. She lay on the grass where the stories go down and listened to the old body telling the rain a tale it had told before. It told her about a time when men drove cattle up the middle of Main Street and women came out with pails to laugh at them for the luck of it, and about the man who had kept bees in his roof and taught them to follow him down to the pub where he set a saucer on the bar and the bees drank beer like they were little gods fallen on hard times. It told her nothing about ash and nothing about vans, which is how old things are cruel without meaning to be. She put her ear to the ground anyway and heard Owen's footfall come along the path a long way away and she stood up and shook the damp out of her hair so that it made a halo she did not deserve.

He came up the slope and kept walking until the walking became breathing and then he stood and let the air speak for him for a half-minute. "If it is a hill," he said, without saying hello because they'd long since used up the hellos and could take them down off a shelf if needed, "I'll die on it. If it isn't, I'll lie on it and complain the whole time. I've started the thing where I think of a sentence I can say to the men with the van that will not make me sound twelve and also will not get me arrested. There is no such sentence. The English called last night. Orlaith. About Cheltenham. She said will I go and I said will I go and she said we knew you'd say yes. I didn't say anything after that for a while because I wanted it to mean nothing and it could not."

"Do not spend," she said, quiet and not looking at him because to look would be to ask for a specific price and she didn't want to see the numbers. "Spend what you have to spend. Keep what you cannot get back."

"What if I cannot tell the difference," he said, but he smiled, because some days you can do nothing and still the sun returns around tea-time and catches the top of the buildings and makes the tin of biscuits glow like it's more than a tin of biscuits. He took her hand and they went down the bank like criminals of sixteen in love with their own luck. They lay under the ash like children and like people too old to be children and they watched the men in high-vis walk by and not look up. Neither of them said that the ash was singing a small thin song that might have been fear. Neither of them said that the air smelt a fraction of a fraction different, like steel. Neither of them said that that night's sleep would be a ledger in which a thousand invisible hands wrote tiny sums and rearranged them in the dark. They both knew, because knowing is not always a trumpet and sometimes is a small tapping on the inside of your cheek while you try to think of what to make for tea.

When the morning came that had been written on the paper with nail, Nicolas woke before the light and had a conversation with her own courage. It sat on the end of the branch like a bird that had been practicing leaving. She asked it to stay and it asked her to please be better than she was, and they agreed that in a pinch they would tell the truth and call that enough. She put on the jumper that had the hole in the left cuff because that hole had been made by a day with Owen when they'd laughed so hard at a swan that hadn't died that they'd become simple, and she went down to the path and sat where the van would have to pass. She put her palms on the cold and made herself not fly. She made herself a girl because that was the move that would put the most awkward weight in the cogs. Owen came and sat and put his bicycle across his knees and then three old men who have never not been at any necessary interruption came and flanked them and told them stories about cattle and bees and the price of cigarettes in 1979. Louise came and brought a flask that had tea in it that tasted like moral fibre and kindness. Orlaith came and stood and did something with her mouth that made her look as if she had learned a new stretch and was pleased with the ache. The three men in high-vis came and one of them said, "Ah now," and another said, "We'll be very tidy," and the third took his phone out and put it back and then took it out again and called a person and said a sentence that could have meant anything depending on what the person already wanted to do.

The blue-coated woman and the chestnut-eyed man did not come in a way anyone else could mention in a form, but Nicolas felt their attention like a hand pressed to the back of her neck, approving and waiting to be disappointed. The hare came no nearer than the lip of the racecourse where the hedge is just higher than a horse's polite opinion of itself, and when it opened its mouth the words did not come because it had already spent them. The van arrived and stopped because stopping is an act of grace and also because a bicycle and three old men are not easily moved without a photograph being taken. The man who got out of the cab was not the one from the measuring day, and his face had a look like somebody in the house had used up his last clean towel and not mentioned it. He said, "Who's in charge," in a way that made all the women want to laugh until his boots melted.

"No one is," Louise said, and her voice went under things and made them firm. "We'll be slow until we're done. Then you'll be quick. Then you'll apologise and then you'll go to your tea and we'll go to ours. There now. Sit down. It looks like rain and it will make your hair behave."

The man looked at the sky and then at the notice and then at the ash and then at the cluster of faces, some defiant and some only curious. He said, "We're due to do three today. We have to be seen to. There's a penalty clause and I don't have a spare penalty lying around. If I make a call and it goes bad, I get the bollocking. If I don't make the call and it goes bad, I get the sack. What's the least bad. Tell me the least bad and I will do it."

Nicolas looked up through the elbow of the ash and saw the universe pretending to be small again and did not forgive it. She took her courage by the beak and she spoke in the voice that made nettles think of being generous. "Go away and come back after lunch," she said. "Make the call that says the people were difficult and you couldn't do it. You won't get the sack because they cannot sack you for a morning unless the manager's wife is the tree. We will sit here for two hours and we will stand up when we need to pee and we will sit again. If you are any kind of person you will pretend we do not exist and thereby make us exist more. After lunch the councillor with the hair will call your boss and tell him to wait because there is a petition which is the exact number the petition needs to be. You will go to Monread and cut a hedge that is fat and uncomplaining. You will get your three done today. The council will do what it will do next week. One of us will cry tonight and it will not be your fault. That is your least bad, and in some worlds it is a victory."

The man listened to her as if she were a weather report that had the decency to include a moral. He nodded once, took his phone out, pressed a number he did not have to look at, and said, "We're delayed, the people are difficult," in a voice that managed not to insult anyone and would not be repeated in a leaflet. He hung up, looked at her, and for a moment his face was not a man in high-vis and a contract. It was a person with a cold kitchen and a boy who needed white runners for a match and a woman who will not let bad stew be called dinner. He tipped his head to her in a bow that would be a joke if he had meant it any less. Then he got back in the cab and the van reversed, a feat equal in skill to any of the things Owen could do with a generator and a handful of pencils, and they were left with the path and an hour they had paid for with their stillness.

Owen let out breath he had not counted holding. He was shaking, and the shaking was not fear exactly but the body coming back to itself and asking permission to be ordinary. He turned to Nicolas and the look he gave her would have been a kiss in any other language. He did not say thank you because thank you would shrink the thing to a size he could carry, and he did not want that. He said, "After lunch," and he said, "I'll get rolls," and he said, "We are not reasonable," and he said, "This is the best I've been all year."

"Don't let it be your best," she said, smiling because victories are heavy and it is polite to cut them into smaller pieces. "Let it be a good middle. Let the best be stupid and quiet and inside a seat on a bus where no one asks you why you are not somewhere else. Let the best be a pear that surprises you by being sweet when it looked like a liar."

He went to the shop and came back with bread and the kind of ham that will curl at the edges if you disrespect it with heat, and Louise brought a second flask that had in it something brown she called broth because it is easier to say than grief, and the old men told a story about a time when a cow put her head in a car window and said hello, and Orlaith texted three people and then put her phone away and sat down on the ground without regard for her coat because sometimes a girl knows she is being watched and sometimes she does not care. They ate and they were a picture that would not be printed anywhere anyone would believe, and when the light changed in that definite way that says the day has made its mind up, the councillor with the hair came and stood a little apart and said, "We'll defer," which is a verb that sounds like mercy when you need exactly mercy. The van came back and did not need to be turned away because it had been told to spend its energy elsewhere, and the nail stayed in the ash, and the paper fluttered, and the ash did not sing. It only stood, which is what a tree does when it has been asked for too much.

In the evening, when the day had broken in the right place and the wrong place and both were bleeding in a way that did not alarm the doctors, Owen came to the ash and he was taller and shorter at once. He said, "We put it off," as if she had not been there, which is a way of keeping a thing safe by wrapping it in words it already knows. She said, "You did," and he kissed her because the body's need to count victories is as old as its need to run. They held each other in a way that had gravity and weather, and when they parted he said, "I go tomorrow," and she said, "Bring me rain," and he said, "I will bring you a word for a rain that makes you smell bread," and she said, "That will be hard," and he said, "Then I will make it up," and they both laughed because making it up was the oldest magic they had and the only one that would not be confiscated at a border.

She watched him go, the bicycle saying small yeses at every joint. She climbed to the nest and lay on her side and put her hand on the moss, and the ash made a sound like a house when it thinks no one is listening. She slept and woke and slept and dreamed of a field with no path and a path with no field, and when she woke in the cold of the dark the ash was still there and the nail was still there and the blue-coated woman had left a ribbon tied in a way only Nicolas would notice. It was not a threat. It was not a gift. It was a knot that could be undone with a hand that knew how, and she did not untie it because she was tired and because not every single thing you can do must be done to prove you are alive.He left in a morning that had been well brushed and yet still had sleep at the edges. The white took itself off the grass and hung about on car roofs like it didn't know where else to be. At the station, the platform smelled of diesel and bakery, and the loudspeaker sounded like a person trying to remember the end of a joke. Owen had a backpack that was pretending to be bigger than it was, because it had to hold more than clothes. His mother wrote a list on the back of a receipt and then folded it and put it in his pocket and then took it out again and read it and laughed at herself and put it back. His father said, "Watch yourself," in a tone that meant I am proud and also this is terrifying and let's not say either of those things out loud. Orlaith texted him a picture of a horse taken at an angle that made all the legs look like a chorus line and a caption that was only three exclamation marks. Nicolas stood near a pillar because pillars have always been good allies to people who are pretending to be a smaller version of their own heart. She touched his sleeve when goodbye passed through the air like a thrown hat and everyone ducked because we've learned a good hat is rare. He looked at her with his face bent sideways because strength is sometimes a matter of looking like you have injured a different part of yourself. "Rain," he said, and she said, "Bread," and they both smiled with too many teeth. The train came in with importance, like it had just been awarded a job it was definitely qualified for, and the doors made that polite noise that asks you not to lose the run of yourself. He stepped in and stood in the doorway too long because people like to pretend the moment of going is not the same as the door closing, and then the carriage took him away with a slow, entirely reasonable theft.

The day afterward had the wrong number of rooms in it. Nicolas walked it as if a builder had made stairs with one step too short and all the ankles in the town tripped a little as they went up. She took herself to the small kitchen where Owen's mother kept the radio tuned to a station that made time feel like soup left on low heat. The tin of biscuits sat on the counter like an altar nobody had dusted for a few days, the notice about the ash still taped to it, the edges softening. "Ah, you," said the woman, with the tired sparkle of someone who has learned to identify allies by smell and not by vows. She pushed a mug across the table that had had tea in it more times than it had had milk. "You'll have something? There's a heel of soda bread left from last night that refused to admit its age." Nicolas nodded and sat and put her wings down to the bones in the polite way you put your knife down in a house not yours. Owen's mother looked at her face a long second, as if reading a page and deciding whether to turn it. "Mind him," she said, and then she laughed because the sentence had tripped its own feet—we ask people to mind what they cannot reach and then we watch them try to grow another hand. "No. That's the thing I say when my heart is stupid and wants to be in more than one place. Mind yourself, girl. Tell me if the men come back and I'll bring the fine china and break it on their heads, one piece each."

Nicolas promised to send word, and then she washed the mugs and, because she had been raised somewhere nothing like this and also exactly like it, she mended the shed door with a trick you could have mistaken for craft. She watched the place where wood and damp had decided to marry out of spite. She heated the latch with the friction of her palm, whispered a yes into the grain where it had been saying no, moved the hinge half an inch, and taught the door that opening could be an art form and not a war. The next time the rain took a run at the wood, the door lifted its chin and let the shoulder pass. Nicolas put down the screwdriver and her secret both, and Owen's mother said, "You're good with your hands," in a voice that sounded like prayer but wasn't.

There are laws and there are men who pretend to be laws. There are women who know the exact shape a law must be if you want it to sleep in the bed with you without kicking. The reprieve had bought them a week and the week immediately began to spend itself without asking for change. Mairead came with a baby on her hip and a folder that weighed as much as one very large potato, and she spilled onto the table the words for stopping that have been hammered out of many afternoons like this one. She said habitat and she said survey and she said Schedule and she said bat in a tone that made the air stiffen. "They don't move for beauty and they don't move for grief," she said, and wiped the baby's mouth with a precision that suggested she had done both moving and wiping with equal stubbornness. "They move for bats. Pipistrelles with their little gloves on. If you can give me a whisper of bat, I'll turn it into a conversation you can stand inside."

Donal came later with hair full of honey and a notebook that had pollen on its spine. He put his hand flat against the ash like a man greeting an old comrade and he listened with his palm. "Fraxinus excelsior," he said, as if Latin could be weapons if you pronounced it with affection. "He's not sick. He's not even bored. But the dieback will come eventually, and they'll say why did we keep it, and you'll have to know your answer before they ask. We'll put up boxes anyway. We'll give the night something to call home. Tell your friends who live in stone to invite the kind of insects that make a bat feel welcome. Lights," he added, as if lamp posts are characters with agency and very poor manners. "Ask for them to be polite and point down. If they're rude and point anywhere they like, you'll have your bats and your men with clipboards, and I will make you a storm out of the letters we write."

It was a precise thing at night, the work of being useful without becoming a headline. Nicolas took a ladder that had been left in someone's side passage because ladders are always where you think they are if you think like a person who carries them. She went out in a coat that people had seen on her before so they would not remember this particular evening because it looked like a repeat. She moved along the path like a line drawn with care and not the wrist. The orange marks on the concrete were small declarations that thought they could not be answered. She answered them by shifting the chalk one finger-width when the damp turned it soft. She lifted the red-and-white tape, not to loosen it but to teach it a better line. She tied a knot that would take a man ten extra heartbeats to undo and those heartbeats would be spent getting cold and grumpy and then he would decide to leave it until after his tea, and the afternoon would be a different animal by then. She tilted a lamppost shield with the edge of a spoon so the cone of light fell short of a likely hole under a soffit. She brushed spider-silk at the mouth of the ash where cracks invite smaller lives, and she whispered invitations into bark that isn't meant to keep secrets and yet always does. She did the blue woman's arithmetic: stones in shoes, tools moved, light turned away from the story. It felt, she had to admit, like prayer done right.

How do you live in a place that is adding new names for itself every day. You go to where animals work and the days have the shape of their bodies. In the yard, winter was a science experiment where steam and breath tried to be the same thing. Louise put a lead rope in Nicolas's hands and said, "Hold this like you know what it's worth," and Nicolas did because value is not a human invention even if money has taken all the credit. She learned the knots that are not obvious until they save a life. She learned, late one afternoon when the light had become a religion and then given it up in disgust, the shape of Orlaith's impatience. It was not cruelty. It was the ache of a girl who wanted to be a person who could put her hand out to a frightened animal and have it stop being frightened because of some gentleness in her she had not yet earned. Orlaith's mother had opinions that approached like weather. Orlaith made jokes with her mouth that came from a sore place farther down and she didn't know she was doing it because the jokes had always served her well.

They were in the tack room, that museum of leather and gossip, when Orlaith said, too casually, "He texted from the boat. He said the water was rough and he wanted to be sick on the Wexford coast to make it count," and then she stopped and looked at Nicolas as if holding a candle up to an old painting and seeing a new figure in the background. There was no malice. There was an invitation to be two women instead of two points on a map that had only one town. Nicolas sat on the inverted bucket and took the brush from Orlaith's hand and cleaned it in the way Louise likes—bristles straight, hair coaxed, not yanked. "He sent me a voice," Nicolas said, because what else do you call a recording. "He said the sea had a grammar that ignored him and he loved it for that, and he said the men across the aisle had a bag of sausage rolls that smelled like their childhood and they wouldn't share, the bastards."

"He's good," Orlaith said, dry. "At being himself." She twisted her mouth the way a person does when they are trying to hold back a dog with a string. "Are you—" She stopped, waved her hand, began again without fanfare. "I like him. I like a lot of people. I am brutal with myself sometimes and then I am surprised when other people think I am brutal with them. I won't be the person who hurts you on purpose. If I do it by accident, you can put my nose out of joint and I won't make it your fault. Is that peace."

"It's a treaty," Nicolas said, delighted and tired both. "We'll sign it with tea and poor biscuits. And you can tell me what it is you think you'll be, if this all goes the way you think it will."

"A person who gets to wear dirty jackets and have money," Orlaith said immediately. "Isn't that vulgar. I don't want London. I don't want Royal this and Heritage that. I want here and a way of staying here that doesn't mean apologising every year to the bank. I want a house I can stand too close to the oven in and say this is mine and the oven will look back at me and know I mean it. I want a horse that won't get sold because a price waved its tail at someone. I want to be weight. I want to be what they can't throw. How's that for a plan."

Nicolas thought of the blue coat and the ledger. She thought of rabbits that speak only when they cannot bear another human sentence going uncorrected. "That is a magnificent plan," she said, and meant it in the way you mean something that is impossible and also done every day by women who have decided. She got up and took Orlaith's coat from the peg and shook it as if she had sprayed it with the approval of the ancients. "There. You can go outside and be looked at by a horse and forgiven for it."

Across the water, Owen sent sounds that arrived as if they had to traverse a field of moths. He sent the crowd, which sounded like a river that had learned swear words. He sent a description of mud that made Nicolas's thighs ache from thinking about it. He sent a sound which was the inside of a stable where three men have chosen to be quiet around an animal because they love it and the love has to be given somewhere that won't be embarrassed by it. "It's not like here," he said, and she could hear the ache, which was gratitude and loss and the particular thrill of belonging someplace that isn't home. "It's sharper. The money is like glass you could cut your lip on and like a window you can see out of. And there was rain this morning that smelled like warmed-up stones, and later rain that made the back of your neck go cold and you thought of school. I haven't found the bread one. Maybe it's here and it's shy. Or maybe it belongs with you where the canal breathes and the baker has a backdoor."

At night, after the house lights had turned the hedges into shadows that had opinions, the other ride came. Not Cheltenham with its clean crescendo and television voices, but the older circuit that runs when nobody is foolish enough to think they are the only ones who know a place. The horses in the yard lifted their heads in their sleep as if remembering a call from a long time ago. The breath of the town went a little shallow, as a courtesy. Nicolas sat in the crook of the ash and watched the line unspool along the dark of the racecourse and into the places where the estate fences try to be proof against anything that isn't a delivery van. There were shapes and the absence of shapes. There was sound that was nearly not sound because it had been practiced into silence by people who did not want their children called out of bed by accident. The blue coat flashed once not with light but with a curve the eye had learned in a previous century under a different moon. The chestnut-eyed man glanced up and tipped his chin at the ash and at Nicolas in it, a kind of acknowledgment that does not come with money and therefore matters more. They slid past the bright of the lamppost where she had tilted the shield, and the dark held, and the ride had the privacy of a prayer in a stairwell. She did not wave. She is not an idiot. She held her breath and let it go at the end like a woman who had not thought herself capable of such a long generosity.

The Moat had a story and it told it when it pleased, which was not when Nicolas wanted most. She went anyway, because going is the first half of everything. The green there swelled like a chest taking in air, as if it had not yet finished breathing from a battle three hundred years ago. She lay down and put her ear to the earth and asked plainly, which is a language the ground likes best. "Hold it for us," she said. "Hold the ash. Hold, if you won't keep. Make the men forget their measurements and remember a tooth they had out when they were eight. Enthrall a councillor's coffee to bitterness. Trip one van and make them go to Monread because they think they always meant to. If you can do it without me paying you with something that looks stupid later, do it. If I have to pay, tell me so I can count to ten and not be noble." The answer that came was not an answer. It was a tale about an ash that had grown away from its own shadow and survived because a pig had leaned on it each day for a year at the same hour, and in that leaning something changed in the wood and the wind found it less interesting to try and take. "Be leaned on," the old body suggested, which is what old bodies say when you want a miracle and they give you physics dressed as wisdom. Nicolas stood up damp and unglorious and said, "Fine," into the air, and the air did not object.

The council sent a man in boots cleaner than his conscience with a clipboard that had the patina of authority and fingerprints. He wore the expression people use to look kind around animals they secretly think are knives without handles. Donal met him and took him to the water and said bats and then said chiroptera for the flourish, and they stood googling together like ritual, only the candles were mobiles and the smoke smelled like battery. Nicolas did her part, which was to be unremarkable and then suddenly remark upon something. She pointed, once, at a seam under a bridge where the drips made a rhythm you could set your heart to if you were tired, and while they listened the smallest squeak gave itself to the winter air, a note the size of a pin and twice as sharp. The man with the boots said, "Ah now," in the exact way the man with the van had, as if ah now were a lever you could pull to move a date. The deferral grew a comma and then a semi-colon and then tried on the shape of the word postpone like a child in a too-big coat.

In the yard, Louise taught Nicolas how to read a horse's ear as if it were script. Night Fax let Nicolas stand at his shoulder and breathe, and his ear went out and in like a boat set to the right anchor point. "This is what it is," Louise said, as if Nicolas had asked, "to keep a thing. Not with your hands. With your staying." Behind them, Orlaith wiped down a bridle and told a story about a girl who had tried to plait a mane without asking first and had been forgiven because even horses know that audacity can be endearing if it is not a habit.

One afternoon it rained in Naas in three different styles. It began as the apologetic drizzle that says I don't really live here, I'm only filling in until the proper rain comes back. Then it became the straight serious stuff that gives people permission to cancel. Then, for ten minutes exactly, it was a golden rain that warmed its own skin and made the smell that places have when they are glad to be alive; the bakery's breath went out into Poplar Square and the canal gave up a perfume like an old book falling open. Nicolas stood under the ash and tasted the word that might be the one she had asked for. She thought of Owen over there under shouts and bookies and trumpets and a kind of mud that is always looking for ankles to call by their first name. She spoke the word as if she were putting it in a bottle to throw across. "Hob," she said, because in her head she could see the stove lid lifting and steam escaping as if with gossip. "Hobrain. The rain that smells like bread because the town is giving thanks without knowing the name of its god." She laughed at herself and felt less foolish immediately because some words put a hand on your back and walk you into a room with courage.

In the small hours Nicolas woke to the sound of somebody trying very hard not to swear and not managing it. She slid from the nest, the way water slides from a boat, and found the chestnut-eyed man in the path with a length of their red-and-white ribbon wrapped around his boot in a manner that would have made a saint curse. He swore in a language that treated vowels as optional. He looked at her with the bleak hilarity of a person who has fallen without grace and seen the future. "We did as you asked," he said, and he made it sound like a complaint and like pride. "We came and we did not become a banner. We flickered. We moved the tool. We rode at improper hours and were seen by nobody important. It is enough to sour a person. You will find your ash still at dawn. You will find your boy writing you a word made silly by love. You will find—" He stopped, listened, and the blue-coated woman materialised from the left-hand margin of the world the way a teacher can come from behind a cupboard and change your entire afternoon. "You will find that we are unimpressed by your honesty," the woman said, almost tenderly. "Which is to say we are impressed and we are saving it for later. Untie the knot when you have your answer. Or leave it. Pay attention when the hare shakes its ears. It is all ears, the hare, and yet still does not hear what it does not want to. There. We have said our piece. Do not make us talk like this too often; it gives the lads stomach ache."

They crossed the path and were gone without leaving so much as a footprint a child could copy. Nicolas stood with the ribbon in one hand and the rain in the other and thought about accounting. She went back up and slept as if she had meant to.

By the time Owen sent the word back, it had been through four hands and two dozen hearts. He sent it tucked behind a picture of a horse's foreleg, sinews like ropes you would not entrust a boat to because a boat is tamer than such a thing. "Hobrain," he said in his voice that made nothing ridiculous unless it deserved it. "That's cheating, you made it first. But I have one for you. The rain that falls exactly when you lock your bike and takes it personally and you laugh because it is harmless and you've somewhere to go and it makes a pet out of you for five minutes. Fanch. As in for feck's sake, and inch. It's a fanch rain. And there was a man today who cried when a thing ran well and pretended he had sweat in his eye. And there was mud that had the names of gods in it, and for a second I thought if I stepped in it I would learn something I shouldn't, so I walked around like a coward. I am tired in a new way. I am all the men I wanted to be when I was ten, except with worse knees. Tell the ash I'll bring it a rosette if I can afford one and if I cannot I'll bring a ribbon off the wrist of a girl who thinks she owns the month of March."

She sat under the ash, the nail cold as sense, and said both words aloud, hobrain and fanch, and they sounded like they had been waiting for their mouths. The ash answered with slow sap, which is another way of saying it was winter and it was busy with its own business. She reached up, finally, for the blue woman's knot and then did not untie it. It was a promise she had made to herself to decide later, and a woman can keep that promise as religion. She wrapped her arms around her coat because there was nothing else immediately to hold, and she thought of the boy on the train with a backpack pretending to be larger. She thought of Mairead's baby chewing on a folder corner. She thought of Donal telling a lie in Latin for the sake of a tree and getting away with it because he pronounced it respectably. She thought of Orlaith wanting a jacket you could use to pay rent with. She thought of Louise's rope and the knots that come undone only when asked by a particular tone. She thought of the hare's one-use words and how it had spent them like a woman putting money down on a counter for the right loaf. She thought of all this and then she laughed once, quietly, because she was more person than door these days, and nobody had come to confiscate her for the crime. She went to sleep with the rain doing whatever exactly it was doing, and the ash stood, and Naas hummed to itself around the canal, and somewhere across water a boy stood under a small awning with mud to his ankles and thought of a girl he loved turning invisible on purpose so she could do the work of being seen at the right time.When the first Sunday without him settled into the estate like a stray cat deciding which window might open, Nicolas found herself walking the long way to the shop for nothing particular. She had discovered that errands could be a way of keeping your insides from spilling, and that choosing the wrong-sized milk on purpose gave the day a structure you could pretend had been imposed from outside. The sky had put on a grey that looked like a school jumper washed too many times, and the canal ran under it unbothered. At the corner where the path bent to show you the water whether you deserved it or not, she met Owen’s father with paint dried on the cuffs of his jacket and the stance of a man who expects to be told to move along and does not intend to. He had the particular handsomeness of men who work on the roofs of things and who are regularly higher than the problems other people have invented for themselves; it wasn’t vanity, it was altitude.

“You’re the one in the tree,” he said, not as a question and not as a challenge, and she nodded because there are kinds of truth that benefit from being admitted in ordinary places. He looked at the ash and at the paper with the nail, which had gathered a bloom of grease and thumbprint as if it had been touched for luck by people who didn’t say they believed in luck. “I said to him once that the heaviest thing in this house is a phrase I put down. He repeated it like it was worth saving and I was going to tell him to mind himself. I didn’t. It’s rare a person will hold your words without trying to spend them as proof they were listening.”

“Your words are safe with him,” she said, and then she said, because like recognizes like, “and he’s safe with you even when you’ve run out of safety to give. I know where the rope is in this town. It’s the people who look like they don’t have any who are the ones keeping everyone from falling.”

He snorted, which was a laugh wearing a coat, and he rubbed his thumb under the edge of the paper until it made a small complaining sound. “I’m going to say something and not take it back and you can keep it or throw it. I liked not knowing about you. Then I knew. Since, my days have had more sky in them, and the bills haven’t got smaller. That’s the whole story I have. If there’s anything you need that fits into a pocket and doesn’t need a receipt, tell me. If it needs a receipt, tell me anyway and I’ll stare at a man until he gives me one with a lower number.”

She thought of the blue woman asking for smallness, of the hare asking her to hoard what little gold she had, and she considered asking for a thing that would look ridiculous later when itemised. “There’s a bolt on the back gate,” she said instead, “that refuses to be the shape of itself. It unlearns. Could you teach it manners in a way it won’t forget.”

“Done,” he said, with the pleasure of a man who had been asked to do something honest. “And tell him from me when he rings, if he rings, that you can be homesick for a place you’re standing in. It’s a trick the world plays on you when it thinks you’re getting cocky.”

The week that followed took on a balance between the intricate and the coarse, like lace hung over a fence. During daylight hours, Nicolas and Mairead and Donal and the three old men whose pension was mostly stories stood at the ash and became polite difficulties. They invited the path to acquire patience as a virtue. They showed mothers how to swing prams slightly toward the root that rose like a knuckle so that the old tree could feel the small kick of weight and know it was still necessary. They watched the night for bats and recorded with the humility of amateurs who have been given a task by creatures who owe them no explanation; Donal’s little detector beeped as shyly as a child saying hello and then hid behind his fingers, and each beep added a syllable to the argument they were assembling from string and common sense.

In the dark, alone or with the breath of others discreetly nearby, Nicolas kept doing the small work. She learned the names of men she would not like if she knew them and called them aloud in the hedge so the hedge would remind them of themselves when necessary. She invented a way of lacing the red-and-white tape so that it held like a well-made lie and came apart like an apology when tugged in exactly the right place. She taught a lamppost not to glare. She went to the Jigginstown ruins with a length of ribbon in her pocket and walked around the low stones as if she were adjusting a hem at a wedding where the bride had refused to be sensible. A fox watched her from the old track with an expression that asked if the performance was necessary and then conceded that perhaps it was, for humans.

On the second night, the blue-coated woman returned for ten breaths and a correction. “You think because you are tired in the right places you must be doing it properly,” she said, not unkind and not kind. “Do less, sharper. You are not a weather system. You are a pin. Prick. That’s the instruction. Leave bruising to those who are built for it.” Then she touched Nicolas’s cheek with a hand that smelled faintly of iron and of cows walking themselves, and she was gone in a way that made the word gone feel like an inadequate verb.

At the yard, life went on as if it were not a question being asked each day by a saw somewhere under a tarpaulin. Louise had the knack of slipping an education into a casual minute. She would say, “Hold that,” and then somehow you were holding a life, and when you gave it back you could not go back to tea without seeing your fingers as tools designed for mercy. Orlaith oscillated at a frequency that could have powered a small town. She was ambitious in the way of people who have discovered that wanting is not shameful if you are explicit about it, and she folded her wanting around Owen in absentia, telling stories about him as if he were a horse they were training: praise, prognosis, a list of faults that were merely futures.

The messages from across the water behaved like birds, sometimes landing on Nicolas’s phone and sometimes wheeling off for reasons of their own. Owen sent a long paragraph about a woman at the rail who wore a hat like the upper half of a swan and sang the names of animals under her breath as if that might change their legs. He sent a complaint about a tea that could have exfoliated a person should it be thrown in their face. He sent a line that was bare and foolish and therefore perfect: “I am happy and I miss you in the exact same amount and if I add anything to either I’ll fall over.” She sent back a photograph of the ash that managed to look like a person standing for a portrait, and she sent hobrain written in the dust on the bakery window while a boy inside rolled croissants like hopes that would turn into butter later if left alone and warmed.

The incident, when it came, arrived wearing every day’s clothes. It was almost noon, the hour when the town is young and old at once and the path fills with small tides. A child on a balance bike that had once been red and had decided to be a rehearsal for other reds came pelting from the estate as if pulled by a string on a map. His father followed at a less murderous speed with a coffee in his hand and a look on his face that said he knew he wasn’t in control of anything except his own weight at that moment, and even that was a negotiation. The boy took the bend and met the glossy skin of a small wet patch that had been laid down by a leak nobody had ever owned. His tyre walked out from under him like a friend who can’t bear a real conversation. He didn’t fall so much as go suddenly horizontal and then head-first in the direction of the canal. The path at that place, because some planner had wanted drama without cost, rose a little above the water. There was a lip of stone and then there was the kind of drop that makes the throat make a sound you will have to pretend later was a cough.

Nicolas saw it in the way things are sometimes faithful enough to tell you they will happen three seconds before they do. She was not close enough to put a hand on the boy. She watched the world become a place where a tiny head was going to meet a cold flat fact, and she did the smallest possible thing to the least important part of the situation. The ash had a thin limb that had grown wrong and therefore right, reaching out like a conductor’s wand toward the path. It had been due for trimming when trimming still sounded like biscuits and chat. She told it, in a language that every plant agrees is at least polite, to pretend for half of one second that it was two inches lower. The branch dipped. The boy’s coat snagged on it as if the world had suddenly remembered buttons. His whole body rotated in a motion that would have delighted a gymnast and appalled his mother. He landed on his arse, hard, and the sound his father made was all the love in a hundred counties being forced through a small throat at speed.

The father’s coffee went to god. The boy howled as if insulted by physics. The people on the path who had been looking at their phones looked at the boy instead and contributed air, which is sometimes the only thing worth giving. Nicolas felt her knees go soft with the aftermath and then solid again, which is how courage actually functions in bodies. The father picked the child up and checked him all over in the manner of men who are trying to be scientific and not to cry. He looked at the ash as if it had just told a joke he didn’t understand and saved his life in the punchline. “Good man,” he said to the tree, because in this town you never risk being rude to a thing that has intervened on your behalf. He said thank you to nobody in particular and to the sky, and he put the boy back on the bike because some lessons are too valuable to allow the world to turn them into fear. The boy set off again with a rage that was better than any prayer and the father followed, leaving the coffee to be drunk by the path’s invisible residents.

“Someone will have filmed it,” Mairead said, pragmatic and privately delighted, later, when people had gathered and retold the story until the branch had not so much dipped as reached down an arm like a nanny aunt. “If an incident falls and it hasn’t been posted online, did it happen at all. We’ll have it on the group with the hedgehog as its icon by tea-time. Nobody will mention bats and nobody will mention chiroptera because they cannot spell it. They will say beloved and they will use a heart, and I will not roll my eyes because there is Room Eleven me who loves that heart and wishes she had had one between her and the world when she was twelve.”

By evening there were photographs that showed nothing and told everything. A short clip captured the boy rising from a place he had not arrived at, his little legs splaying in that frog way of fearless children, the ash’s thin finger in the top of the frame like a moral. The caption read, “This old fella saved our Finn today, thanks to all who are trying to keep him,” and the comments beneath it were those of a place that behaves like family as long as no one asks for money. There were stories about apples and climbing and a bicycle repaired for free “back in the old shop on New Row before the man’s brother married a cousin and took him to Kildare town,” and there were prayers disguised as laughing faces. The councillor with the hair did not comment but he sent a message that contained four words, god bless the internet, and Donal forwarded it to Nicolas with an emoji that had bees where its eyes would be.

Across the water, the races proceeded as if horses had never heard of ash trees and never would. Owen’s day lobbed greens and reds at him like a child showing off its crayons, and he ran from one socket of usefulness to another, screwing down the world with competence as his only authority. There was a moment when a man in a coat that could have bought you a small house came and put a hand on Owen’s shoulder in the same place where Orlaith sometimes rested hers, and said a sentence that began, “We’re putting together a team,” and ended, “proper apprenticeship, mind, not the nonsense the Tech are pawning off as if they invented spanners.” The words slotted into the spaces in Owen that had been cut for just such a thing and that had been filled until now with wishes and odds and ends. Orlaith saw the fit from across the concrete and, because she was not cruel when alert and only accidentally cruel when tired, she did not smile. She came later with a paper cup of tea and held it out and looked at his face and did not make any of the jokes in her pocket.

“I told them I’d think,” he said, as if he had ever been able to live with a future that arrived unexamined. “I thought already. I thought and thought until my thoughts were worn at the elbows. I rang the house and Mam said she didn’t mind as long as I got a certificate at the end of it because then if anyone questioned me she could argue on my behalf in a way that would satisfy them. I didn’t ring him because he’ll say do what you like and I will, and then if it breaks I won’t be able to blame him. I wanted to ring her. I didn’t ring her, because she would say spend only what you can earn back with sleep, and I would say what do you know about earning and she would say all right and that would be the end of me for the day.”

“You’re not the only person who knows how to hold a thought long enough to warm it,” Orlaith said, and she sipped her tea in a way that said she was not completely delighted by the taste and would write a letter to someone about it if given an hour and a stamp. “If you asked me what you should do I would tell you to do the thing you can tell your younger self about without having to explain why you didn’t. That’s obscene advice but it’s the only kind I’ve got that isn’t me using you to make a better story for myself.”

When the light went mean and thin and the stands emptied of the respectable in their respectable coats, Owen walked out to the back where the air smells of hay and petrol and a kind of loneliness that is content with its own company. He leaned on a wall that had listened to a lot of good arguments and some bad ones. He took his phone out of his pocket and the path to Naas opened inside him like a phrase. He spoke the fanch word to her because it had been raining in fits all day and because saying it would take the ache down to where it could be carried. She told him about the boy and the branch and she used her voice carefully because she had discovered that if you describe a miracle too enthusiastically to someone you love they will take the edge of it with their being in love with you, and sometimes the right edge must cut.

“They’re going to leave it for winter,” she said, because she could hear the commas lining up in the councillor’s inbox. “Bats and boys and the fact that the men with the van cannot get a second van this week because all the vans are doing Santa in Kildare Village. After winter it will be a new council year and everyone will discover they are more reasonable when the daffodils come up. That’s the good lie I’m telling myself. It is so good I’ll keep it when it turns out to be half a lie.”

“Keep it,” he said. “And if it breaks, I’ll mend it with little screws you can’t see from three steps away unless you’ve learned how to look. They asked me to stay,” he added, and then he laughed because the sentence dropped into the conversation like a stone into a barrel, splashing everything that thought it had settled. “Orlaith will kill me if I say no. She will kill me if I say yes. That’s a good friend.”

“She’s the kind who will put a hand on a frightened animal and not look around to see who is praising her for it,” Nicolas said, and she lay back on the ash because the bark had become her friend as well, and she wanted it to hear that its future had acquired a comma. “Do not spend. That was the hare’s commandment. Spend if you must but not the coin that buys your sleep. If sleep cannot be bought, make it in your hands like bread. If you cannot make bread, hoard biscuits like my women do and tell guilt to sit on the draining board and keep quiet.”

He made a noise that was a laugh and a plea and a man remembering that he owned bones. He said he would sleep because there was nothing for him to do that night that he could not ruin with trying. He said he would send a picture of mud that had thought of being old and had decided against it. He said her name once like he was putting his mouth around a thing that had been in his pocket all day for luck. Then he hung up and looked at the sky over a different country and realised he had found the bread rain after all, only it was not the smell of baking but the warmth of a kitchen that welcomed without asking you for a story about your usefulness. He cried a little and the cry was as short and clean as a dog shaking itself after swimming.

The next morning, Nicolas woke to a town that had exerted itself during the night in a quiet way. Someone had tied a laminated sign to the ash that said thank you in four languages and in the fifth in pictures of small hands. Someone had put a plastic duck on the canal wall with a Post-it that read “Guard,” and the joke had made its point and walked itself off, satisfied. Someone had posted online that the ash had been there since 1902 and someone else had said earlier and someone had said prove it and three people had volunteered to go to the library to look through the bound journals as if that building had been constructed just for this day. Nicolas went into the kitchen at Owen’s and found his mother with a face set like a dial and a pen in her hair like a weapon.

“They want to send him a form,” she said, hollow with triumph. “A form that might make a thing happen, or might make a thing be waited for. I said yes and I said no in the same breath and now it’s the kind of day it is. Did he ring you last night and tell you the thing that will change all of us or tell you nothing and that would still change us.”

“He told me something and nothing,” Nicolas said, and she cut a square of bread with more delicacy than it deserved because rituals must be respected even when the altar is only a breadboard. “He will do the thing that does not make him ashamed of himself ten years from now. That is the only advice anyone should give and I am as unqualified to give it as anyone.”

“And you,” the woman said, pausing with her knife above butter as if it were a sentence she might change the ending of, “will you sit in a tree forever and make angels out of people who should have been men and women. Will you marry a gate and call it romance.”

“I will marry a gate if the gate has manners and a mind to keep cattle where they have decided they want to be,” Nicolas said, and then she softened because the old body under The Moat had taught her that sometimes the right joke opens the door the truth is standing behind, and sometimes the truth is better told plain. “I will love your boy until he is a man who cannot be told what to do by anyone who doesn’t know his face. I will leave if I am making you more tired than the men whose names come through your letterbox. I will be a person and not a saint and you can soak the tea leaves in that and throw them at anyone who thinks me otherwise.”

“Good girl,” the woman said, and her eyes were wet with something that was not purely sadness. “Good girl, good girl, good girl,” she said again, as if by saying it three times she could prevent any of them becoming foolish with the idea. Then she leaned on the counter and told Nicolas, at surprising length and with names, about the last time she had thought her own life might branch in two and how she had chosen the one that made the washing line closest to the kitchen. Nicolas listened properly and stored it because she had learned that very ordinary courage requires careful shelving if it is not to be mislaid behind the fancy jars.

By noon the deferral had turned into a postponement with a review and the review had been scheduled for a date so far in the new year that nobody could picture it without the intervention of a calendar. Donal announced that the bat boxes had been delivered and would look lovely if you squinted. Louise said something short and filthy about men with clipboards that made Mairead applaud and the oldest of the old men cross himself without meaning to. Orlaith, who had acquired a new coat with buttons that were exactly the right level of arrogant, stood under Night Fax’s nose and reported the results with a queen’s indifference to her own relief. The ash, which had finished the thing trees do in winter and had moved on to the thing they do immediately after that, allowed itself to be leaned on with gratitude that showed in small things like a branch giving less than it might have.

At dusk, in the pause that thinks it’s longer than it is, the chestnut-eyed man returned as if for a summary. He walked out of the hedge and into the air in a manner that made the hedge more itself afterward, as if being used had reminded it of its function. His mouth had the curve of a person who has been paid and still considers himself in debt. “For a while,” he said, making the words as unmagical as he could bear, “you are to be bored. Which, for the likes of you, is a triumph and a punishment. Do not look around and try to fix everything. You will be tempted to descend on a dozen small wrongs and relieve them of their drama. Resist. Keep the tool where you can find it. Keep the pin sharp. And when the boy comes back with a decision, pretend at first that you do not mind. You will mind. You will live.”

“I will live,” she said, and it sounded almost like a boast and almost like a plea. “And while I am living I will ask you something I have been practicing pretending I do not want to ask. Is there a way to keep what is kept without owing you something I cannot afford.”

He tilted his head in a way that made him look for a second exactly like a horse learning a new gate. “If you ask for nothing, we will give you advice as if we were geniuses of restraint. If you ask for something, we will give you what you ask for and also the bill. That is the way of worlds. You have been canny so far. Stay petty. Petty will take you through. Grand will take you out to sea and forget to bring you your coat.”

The rain came then in a little wash that anyone sensible would have called fanch and walked home under. Nicolas stayed. She stood close to the ash and said a few words without sound and made herself believe in their ordinary power. Across the water, under floodlights that make everything a play, Owen watched a horse stumble and then stay up in such a way that the air applauded on its own. He saw a lad no older than himself fail to swallow his heart fast enough and weep into the neck of an animal that did not mind. He felt the shape of the offer in his pocket like a stone he might skip across a canal if he were a different kind of person and the canal were a different kind of listener. He went back to the bed-and-breakfast where the owner had put out a plate of biscuits that were so dry they could have been used as educational tools, and he closed his eyes, and he dreamed of a tree that knew exactly when to move and when not to, and of a girl who had taken all the important roads that do not appear on any map and made them with her feet. He woke up determined and afraid, which is the only guarantee that a decision will be worth the paper you don’t write it on.

In the morning Nicolas took a packet of bat boxes under her arm like a confessional and went with Donal and the old men along the path that had decided to behave itself for a while. They put the boxes up in places a human would not think to check unless they were the kind of human who kept a notebook with things in it like “listen for the small squeaks at seven,” and Donal gave a small lecture about rejection, how bats ignore houses you make for them the way people ignore advice until the day they don’t and then they act as if it was their idea all along. Nicolas held the ladder and let an old man climb because dignity is a thing you can hand to a person without making a ceremony of it, and the old man patted the ash on the way down in the manner of men who have always had luck because they fed it with crumbs every day at nine.

By the time they were finished, the light had squared itself away behind the church and the canal had decided for the night to pretend it was deeper than it was. Nicolas sat in the crook and let the day leave, and she counted all the things she had not spent. She had not spent the good will of Owen’s mother on a gesture that would have tasted brave and been stupid. She had not spent the goodwill of the blue coat on a banner that would have served for one hour and become rag. She had not spent the patience of the Gardaí who have to pretend they don’t believe in any of this as part of the job description. She had not spent sleep. She would not sleep, and this would be her fault and no one else’s, and in the morning when Owen rang she would answer with a voice that sounded like bread. She thought of his father and the bolt on the back gate and how easy it is sometimes to give a person the exact job they are good at and thereby make them feel as if god exists. She thought of Orlaith’s jacket and the rent you can pay with a button if you are quick. She thought of the hare, and she said the word spend aloud like a warning, and she felt the ash’s answering silence agree.

In the distance, beyond any light she would admit to believing in, there was the sound of a train that had decided to come home and would make a small noise when it stopped to tell the platform that it had done a good job. She tucked her wings so flat they were thought, and she let the night lean on her the way the pig had leaned on the ash, and she learned the thing the ground had told her: you hold by being held. She slept without dreaming and woke to rain that definitely, absolutely, stubbornly smelled like bread. She laughed out loud and the laugh rolled along the path like a thing that wanted to catch up with itself, and the three old men heard it and did not look up out of respect for joy doing its rounds.He came home under a sky that had the colour of cooled metal and the generosity of steam. The train slid in with the mild self-importance of a creature that has been fed and praised all day, and Owen stepped down with mud in the lace of his boots and a brightness at the edges of him like a thing he’d carried wrapped up and had decided to unwrap in public. His mother’s eyes found him before his feet did, his father’s hand touched his shoulder with that familiar two-tap that says I’m counting you and I like the number, and behind the pillar Nicolas felt her mouth make a shape she had not instructed it to learn. He saw her even though she was behaving like stone behaves when it has work to do. He reached her by the small, old engineer’s trick of walking directly and pretending you’re checking bolts on the way. They stood close enough to breathe the same small ribbon of air and not so close that anyone would think a ceremony was happening. He said, “Hob,” like a man giving a password that is also a joke, and she said, “Fanch,” with all the respect a ridiculous thing deserves, and they both smiled too widely because restraint and reunion find it hard to share a plate.

He smelled of horses and engines and new rooms. She put her palm to his cheek as if she were verifying a measurement and found the face she knew and the one he had borrowed for the week and would give back slowly. The platform voices tripped over names and destinations and the old men made way because they know the shape of a young man returning with word. His mother kissed him in a way that pushed her relief back inside where it could do no harm. His father took the bag that had pretended to be bigger and found it only respectable. Orlaith arrived late and out of breath with a rosette on her wrist like a mockery of modesty; she put it on him without looking at Nicolas as if she were crowning a useful king. They all went to the car together and he walked the length of the town’s breath holding his two lives with one hand and making it look like no work at all.

In the kitchen that had always had more warmth than tiles, they fed him as if he had been to America and back and not just to a shore that taught better vowels. He told the parts of the tale that are meant for tables. He made the mud heroic and the owners human and the horses flawed in a way that could be forgiven with carrots. He described a man whose hat had made him taller and nervous and a boy who learned in a day that there are hands that do not love you which can still save you. He mentioned, with a careful casualness that would have made a lawyer nod, that there had been an offer to stay in a shape that paid tax, that would bring with it letters and a certificate to brandish at bureaucracy when required. The words hung in the air like new curtains. His mother said, “Christ above,” in a tone that left Christ out of it and kept the above. His father said, “Protein,” and pushed a chop toward him as if decisions should be greeted with meat and a place to sit.

Later he stood by the back door and looked at the shed, pleased to find the latch lifting the way a good dog lifts its head when its name is called. “She’s after teaching the door to behave,” his mother said, washing a cup at a pace that suggested she was trying not to tell a story. “It was pure scandal before. Now look at it. I went out in the rain and it didn’t even sulk.” He went out and ran his hand along the wood as if the grain might offer advice. His father joined him and looked up at the thin collar of sky visible from the little square of concrete. “You can be home and homesick at once,” he said, with generosity and no self-pity. “It’s like chewing and remembering being hungry. Make a decision with that in mind and you’ll avoid half the mistakes I’ve made and invent your own, God help us.”

They went to the ash at dusk because it could not bear not being told. The paper with the nail had acquired company: a thank you with small hands, a heart drawn by someone unembarrassed, a rough sketch of a swan that had its neck exactly wrong and its courage exactly right. Owen put his hand on the bark and felt the minor hum of a thing that had been asked to do more than was polite and had done it anyway. “It stood for me while I was gone,” he said, which sounded foolish and was a kind of precise. Nicolas leant her back against the trunk and let it take her weight the way a house does when a person it loves leans on the kitchen table and groans. “Do not spend,” she said, not as law now but as a question he could answer or ignore. He closed his eyes so the town would not feel like an audience and then opened them because this was between them and no spectators would be indulged. “They offered me a proper, with a wage and a book. There’s a van and there’s a week in the Technical every month so they can put the theory in your head and the practical through your fingers and hope the two might marry. It’s Curragh mostly, and Punchestown, and trips across as required. They called it a scheme so it must be real. Orlaith told them to go away for five minutes so I could pretend to consider saying no. I considered. My mother nodded at me like I’d done something right and I’d only told her about a phone call. My father said do as you please and I said I will and he said grand and I wanted to cry with the ridiculous grown-ness of it.”

She listened the way a snipe listens for insects, head tilted, hearing echo and movement at once. She could see the shape the decision made around him, how it would change the angles of his elbows, the patience of his mouth. For an oddly unmagical moment she wanted to be a woman who could lay a hand on a boy’s chest and say stay and be obeyed, and the wanting embarrassed and thrilled her. “Go,” she said, and the word did not cost her anything because she had already paid for it in small coins over the last week. “Go and be where your hands are asked for. I will not be noble about it and neither will I be mean. There are in-betweeners. We can live there. We’ll practice. We will do it badly and then better and then forget the last time we did it badly, which is a sacrament where I come from.”

They walked the canal with the thin winter smell of bread lifting out of the town like a good lie everyone agreed to tell. He pushed the bicycle and told a long story about a horse who refused to be loaded until a woman sang the wrong song wrong enough to satisfy it. She told a short story about a bat that had adopted a new word and then considered adopting a box if the box proved itself worthy. He didn’t ask for promises because he had learned more interesting currencies, and she didn’t offer any because she had learned how heavy they are to carry into shops that cannot accept them. When they reached the bend where Finn had nearly met a truth, they stopped without agreeing and looked at the skin of the water holding itself calm like someone waiting to be thanked and hoping they had dressed correctly. “I saw you,” he said quietly, which was impossible and yet she did not argue. “Not with my eyes. Somewhere. The branch. Don’t spend, and you spent perfectly.” She took his hand because it was the fastest route between them. “I moved a thing half an inch,” she said, aiming for accuracy to keep her from being admired to death. “I was only petty. It worked.” He leaned his forehead against hers and for a moment the town had the decency to pretend it had other places to be.

The next morning he put on his best jeans because even in a place where horses are gods there are offices, and even in a place where he is himself there are thresholds that prefer you tidy. He went with Orlaith to the yard that was hiring him and signed papers with a pen that dragged as if the ink had opinions. The man with the coat that could buy a house shook his hand like a father who has decided to be proud and generous today because it will look well on him, and a woman from the Tech stamped a form as if each stamp removed a small sin from mankind. Orlaith clapped him on the back and made the joke about never having to buy his own spanner again, and a stable boy who had long ago sworn he would not admire anyone admired him. He came home and stood at the sink and washed his hands, which is a thing men do when they have done something public and would like to return to being only one person for six minutes.

Nicolas spent the day making sure the world did not think it had got away with itself. She walked the path and found the places where the chalk had flaked and nursed it back into certainty. She coaxed a lamppost into tipping its face another degree toward shame. She climbed Louise’s ladder and tucked Donal’s boxes under the eaves of the bridge where the drips made music, and she spoke invitations into the mouths of little hollows that might be named home by things that do not ask permission. When she passed the Jigginstown stones, she left a small string-bound bundle that contained a curl of hair from a horse’s mane and a pinch of bakery flour and a name she had not used since a winter when cattle had been taller. The old body under the green rolled the story over and did not say no.

At the yard there was a day that went wrong and then did not. Night Fax, who had suffered indignities and rewards in equal measure this cold season, turned in his box as if finding his own tail newly offensive and then froze with his back lifting like a question. Louise saw it in the first half breath because she knows the shape of catastrophe before it cares to introduce itself. She was across the straw with a hand flat, the vet was called with a sentence that already had the answer in it, and the stable turned itself into a machine where each cog knew why it had to be a cog and not a story. Orlaith was white as someone who has never been allowed to like a thing without the fear of losing it being part of the contract, and she held a lead rope like a lifeline given to her by a god she had not paid for. Nicolas held the horse’s eye with the undramatic attention that is a medicine you can give by being boring. The vet arrived with competence shoved into a bag and words that reassured not because they were kind but because they were true. Owen came running from the Tech with a smell of solder still on his coat and fell into the work without asking for a role or a witness. They walked Night Fax, they cursed him affectionately, they begged him to take the sinister thought out of his belly, they made nonsense promises they would never be required to keep, and a long two hours later the horse sighed in a way that made every person in the place feel sixty percent less vivid with relief.

After, in the quiet that comes into a room when it has decided to forgive you, they sat on upturned buckets and let their hearts do whatever it is hearts do to go back to their correct size. Louise lit a cigarette with the face of a woman who would quit on her own terms and not before. Orlaith leaned her head against the door and let it take her weight without asking what it had done to deserve such intimacy. Owen rested his hands palm-up on his knees as if they were two small tired animals he had carried all day and had just remembered to set down. Nicolas looked between them and thought, with a rush of ungenerous happiness, that there are rooms you can only enter after you have been tired together in exactly this way.

She told the blue-coated woman that night, because honesty given in small pieces buys you silence on other nights. “I did nothing,” she said, meaning I did everything I could that would not break whatever agreement holds this world together. “I was a wall and a girl and a rope. I made tea when tea was the bridge between panic and sense. If there is a ledger, put down that I paid with boredom and with the taste of rope in my mouth.” The blue woman nodded as if she approved of this accounting system, and she said, with a voice that would have scolded some other creature and so was gentle here, “Do not confuse noise with payment. Keep spending exactly this and you will not have to borrow.”

Owen’s father came through the back gate with a square set to his jaw that means he has decided a thing will be easy and will become right if he says so often enough. He took the bolt at the gate and tutted at it with a love that would have made a person cry. He filed its pride down to a reasonable shape. He moved the strikeplate a measurement you’d need a jeweller’s eye to admire. He spat on his thumb and smoothed a burr as if it were a boy’s hair on the way to mass. “There now,” he said to the metal, which is what you say in this town when you have performed a minor miracle and would like to pretend it was only honesty. Nicolas watched the work like a student at the back of a class who has finally been told this lesson is the one she will use in her life every day. He turned and saw her and nodded, and with the unshowy grace of men who will tell a truth if you stand very still and do not advertise how much you needed it, he said, “I like you because you don’t tell me the same thing twice. Some people advise like they’re selling you a thing they bought too dear. You don’t. If you ever need a ladder in a hurry, I have four and I trust you with all of them.”

Solstice took the town by surprise because everyone had been busy mistaking it for Christmas. Nicolas had learned a trick in a place that is not on a map and she decided to use it without letting anyone know they were being tricked into delight. She told three children and two old men that there would be a lantern walk that was not a lantern walk, starting at Poplar Square and ending at the ash, where there would be biscuits and a song if someone could be bullied into remembering the tune. She told Mairead because Mairead knows how to multiply without mathematics. She told the baker because he is the next thing to a bell in this town and he rings without guilt. At dusk, bodies collected in the square at the pace bread cools, and there were jam jars with candles and torches and the kind of fairy lights that refuse to die even when the lead is frayed. The three old men told a story about swallows and the light remembered the shape of their hands. A child lost a glove immediately and an aunt found it with triumph that could have powered The Point. They walked together with the ridiculous solemnity that is the only kind worth practicing. At the ash there were biscuits and a song nobody knew all the words to and a swan drawn again, better this time, on a piece of cardboard with a pen that had been found in a washing machine. Louise was there with a paper cup, and she did not smile, which is her way of admitting she is happy. Orlaith swore she would not sing and then did, and it made three people reconsider their opinions of her without changing their faces. The councillor with the hair arrived and made a speech by accident, the best kind, about holes in the dark and what we fill them with when we are soft. Donal kept the beeping machine in his pocket because he is wise. The ash stood and accepted the weight leaned on it and was, for that hour and then for another long minute after people had gone home, beloved.

There is a boredom to reprieve when it is honest and Nicolas learned to wear it like a good sweater. She continued to move the small world half an inch at a time and pretended to be impatient with herself when in fact she was delighted to have found a place that fit the exact shape of her hands. She left the blue ribbon tied, but she stroked it once and felt under her skin a little sting that felt like a debt paid in a coin that hadn’t hurt to part with. The chestnut-eyed man came when Irelands and Englands do the odd handover of weather and told her, with the air of a person confessing to a small theft that he’d been praised for in the wrong room, that the ride had gone round by the lower hedge because the lamplight had chosen politeness and they had chosen gratitude. “We don’t thank in public,” he said, because he is of a people who believe thanks is a trap. “So I’ll say only that next year when something is asked of us in your name, we will do it and pretend we hated the doing.” She accepted this odd gift with a nod because rejecting it would make it larger.

When January wanted to be a joke and the joke wore thin, Owen walked into the Tech carrying a bag that thought it was important. He learned the names of currents and the proper way to persuade a wire that has no sense of duty. He sat in a room with a girl whose family ran a garage in Prosperous and watched her draw a circuit with the concentration of a nun at prayer. He discovered that a diagram is only a love letter to a thing you haven’t yet met. On the days he was not there, he was at the yard or at a neighbour yard with the van that now had a magnet with his name on it as if to pin him to his own future. He came home at nights stupid with good exhaustion and slept like a boy who had spent all day in water. He still came to the ash. He still leaned and said nothing in a way that is one of the better kinds of conversation. He still said her name with his face lit as if he had turned toward a familiar window.

He told her about the day he wired a thing that had been refusing to sit and it sat, and about the man who had watched him work and said nothing and then said later, “You should have been here ten years ago,” and meant in the world, alive in a way that wasn’t an apology. She told him about the bat that had moved into a box like a small god accepting a lesser temple, and about a woman who had stopped to admire the ash and had said, “I never used to see trees, now I can’t stop,” and had looked frightened because she had no idea how many trees there are. He told her that Orlaith had bought a jacket with a zip you could hear across a yard and that she seemed to expect a horse to admire it and that the horse had not and that he had laughed and been forgiven. She told him that Louise had cried into a horse’s mane and been comforted, and that she had never thought to see such a thing in a life that knew her name.

On a Tuesday that had put all its effort into being blunt, Nicolas followed the hare at last to the place where the racecourse meets the hedge and the hedge meets the old right-of-way. She had not chased; she had been permitted. The hare sat as if it were a person who had learned patience and was showing off. It did not speak because one does not waste a human tongue on the repetition of decent advice. It scratched its ear with its long foot and made a sound that was entirely animal and entirely consultative. Nicolas said, “I didn’t spend. Not more than I could earn back with sleep and soup,” and the hare blew its nose on the wind and rocketed into the field because approbation is for dogs and hares are beyond such a thing. She laughed and made a small curtsey to the spot it had vacated because she is well-mannered that way.

The notice on the tin of biscuits became an artefact with a soft edge and was moved to the drawer where receipts live and dreams of audits. The nail stayed in the ash longer than was necessary because sometimes it is good to keep a small discomfort where you can see it. One morning Nicolas took a butter knife, the faithful tool of quiet domestics, and eased the nail out with a care entirely disproportionate to the metal’s worth. She held it in her palm and felt the old intent gone from it, only shape left, and she thought of all the things that can be repurposed this way, all the words that can lose their violence and be used to hang a picture of a swan drawn badly at first and better later.

On the day Owen went with the van to put lights in a shed where calves would learn the shape of their halters and resisted it, Orlaith appeared under the ash with her coat open and no plan. She stood a moment feeling awkward because she had not learned how to address a woman in a tree and had never had to. “He’s after doing the thing we knew he would,” she said after the second beat, choosing the tone that admits relief and keeps pride. “I thought I’d be cross if he stayed and cross if he went. I am less cross than I expected. You’ve a way of making the world large enough that a person’s choices don’t bruise me. I resent you for that only slightly.” Nicolas laughed and patted the bark beside her, and Orlaith did not climb because even boldness has its favourite places. “If you ever need a man shouted at so that he doesn’t know whether to laugh or apologise,” Orlaith added, spinning a plait with the sureness of practice, “I have a voice on me that would bless the Pope and curse the Coillte with equal efficiency.” Nicolas tucked that into the pocket where she keeps instruments and used it once later with excellent results.

There was a morning when the town was lit like a waiting room and she almost missed the first sign that the world was about to require something new again. The ash made a sound like someone turning a page quickly and the canal lifted one breath out of its chest and put it back like an idea rejected. She heard tyres making the ragged noise of a person trying to stop a life in shoes made for dancing. It was not a van in high-vis. It was a boy too old for the word boy and too young to be a cautionary tale, on a motorbike that had undertaken adulthood without paperwork. He came round the bend with the insolent music of risk, saw the pram, saw the dog that insisted it be a friend to every pram, saw the river having one of its honest days, saw the ash and did not see it; he saw his choice and found it too late. The bark took his shoulder like a blow a father gives his son when the son has become too cocky and needs reminding of the shape of a family. He bounced and the bike went away from him like an idea abandoned. The woman with the pram made the sound people make when an event is an accusation. The boy lay still and then moved his hands as if counting something he had just been given for free and needed to ensure was true.

Nicolas was there because she is a person who lives in the elbows of trouble. She put her hand to his hair and found the small blood you get for free when you have overestimated yourself. He looked at her with confusion that could have turned to anger if offered the wrong words. She said none. She sat and let him see something still where everything else was suddenly not. The Gardaí came and the old one knew how to take a statement without making a story of it and the young one recognised the flavour of event and shut his mouth. The boy sat up and discovered he was made of more bone than bravado and hated this realisation briefly and then accepted it because the pram had been saved and he had saved it. His face learned something that will not desert him when his hair goes grey. “You’ll live,” Louise said, appearing the way practical mercy appears, from the side with a tea towel and an order. “The tree will live. The dog will live. The pram has a dent, the baby is fine, the mother will bring you a cake when she has time to hate you less.” The boy nodded, the mother nodded, the dog wagged like it was negotiating a treaty, and the ash stood with dignity as if it had been an elder all its life and not just good at pretending.

She told Owen later and he swore in relief because there is such a thing as a good scare and a decent end to it. He was under a ceiling with wires politely obedient for once, and he looked at the rectangle of sky and thought how many things a horizon keeps you from seeing and how many things it promises. “Petty,” he said, pleased at the flavour of the word in his mouth, as if it were a sweet that is only sold in one shop in one town on one day of the week. “Stay petty. We will raise a life out of that.” She agreed and felt the old world turn over under them to show its soft side.

In bed-and-bothered hours she took out the bead that had once been in a magpie’s mouth and let it sit in her palm and tell her nothing. She did not spend it. She liked that not-spending can be a form of wealth if you’re stubborn and properly advised. She tied the blue woman’s ribbon into a second knot because sometimes the polite thing to do is leave things as you find them but improved by your hand, and she left it where even a person who did not believe in such things might eventually feel moved to untie something without knowing why.

At the end of that winter’s first chapter, with the council’s emails asleep and the Tech’s radiators hissing complaints like small dragons, she stood in the elbow of the ash in a coat that had learned her shoulders and thought about the shape the year had made around them. She considered how much of it had been held by hands that were available and by ropes that were mended without asking permission. She thought of the three old men who have mastered the timing of a story so well that they can stand in the door of a day and keep it from closing until a child arrives with shoes on the wrong feet. She thought of Orlaith wanting to be weight and of Louise knowing how to be weight without making a speech about it. She thought of Donal’s lying Latin and Mairead’s righteous bureaucracy and Owen’s father’s ladder and his mother’s list on the back of a receipt and how some artefacts act like sacraments if you’ve the right priest. She thought of the hare’s thrift and the blue coat’s ledger and the chestnut-eyed man’s grudging gratitude, and she counted herself lucky to have learned who needed paying and how.

When the weather softened just enough to make the nightly frost feel like a joke told once too often, Owen came up the path with a walk he had not had before, a gait that matched a decision he had put on and found fit. He sat with his back to the ash and looked at her and allowed himself the luxury of seeing his own future as if it did not have to be earned in bruises. “I said yes,” he told her, which she knew. “I told them I am theirs if they will allow me to be Naas’s too. I told them I will go to England and come back with the rain in my pockets. I told them I will take a certificate like a weapon and also like a hymn. I told them that if a tree asks for me I’m not to be told to shut the door, I’m to be given the day. They laughed and said you must have a queer union and I said my union is older than your grandfathers. They put it on paper, some of it, at least. Will you be cross with me when I am exhausted and proud and impossible. Will you say my name like a thing that can be found in a dark room.”

She touched his mouth with two fingers and felt there the pulse that belongs to animals that run and to men who have decided to become their own kind of animal. “I will be petty with you,” she said, which is one way of making a vow. “I will move our lives half an inch toward the place where they are most themselves. I will not let you spend what you can’t earn back with sleep and biscuits. I will stand in front of the van when the van needs a person to realise itself, and I will go home when the van only needs a man with a clipboard and a story for later. I will not be grand. I will be exact. I will be here.”

They kissed, once, and the kiss was not a lightning but the laying down of plans. It was the kind of kiss that makes the next morning easier before either of you knows why. The canal shifted its shoulder as if to allow the town to sit more comfortably for an hour. The ash accepted the leaning and counted everyone present and found that for the moment the tally matched the mercy. Somewhere, on a windowsill warmed by the idea of bread, a bat adjusted its small body and decided to stay. And in the room of themselves that never appears on any plan, a girl with wings and a boy with tools set a lamp on a table and turned it low and agreed to see what they would build before spring grew impatient with them both.
