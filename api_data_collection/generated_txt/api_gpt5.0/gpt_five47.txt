The tide tells lies. Or maybe I do. I can never quite tell which one of us starts it—the long hiss of water pulling back over the rocks, the burr of my breath counting, the salt dampening my hairline while the sky sits dumb and bruised over Ocean Beach. The pier is a sketch in the half-light, an arm pointing into a gray that won’t commit to morning, its barnacled elbow creaking to an old memory. I stand at the lip of the shore with a bag of salt and a bottle of rosemary oil and the copper coin Abuela keeps under the register for “extra luck.” I told myself I would come here to watch and nothing else, but the truth slides around like the foam, it gets into every space. I have always made circles when I’m nervous.

The sand wants to swallow the circle before I finish it, like a mouth closing around a word. I trace faster, my finger cold, trying not to think about the way my heart is beating like a foot on a squeaky stair. I whisper the names of the soft things. Sea lettuce, eelgrass, cloud. My voice stumbles on cloud because the sky is just beginning to thin over Point Loma, letting a rash of pink show through, the same color as my first lipstick, the one Lina dared me to wear to finals. I press the copper coin into the center of the circle and rub rosemary on my wrists, the bottle clattering against my rings, my teeth clicking because I’m chattering, though it’s not actually that cold.

There’s a tremor under the sand, a little sigh. Not a quake. A shrug. I learned to tell the difference before I learned to swim. Our part of the earth is always whispering like this, like a body muttering through a dream. Abuela says that’s where the old spells fit best, under the talk, inside the place where things rub against each other. “You?” she told me, tapping my forehead. “You are all thresholds, Marisol.” She says my full name when she wants me to listen. “Find your doors.”

A gull watches me, head cocked, his eyes the ridiculous yellow of plastic toys. He’s missing two toes. When he hops closer, dragging his foot just enough to make me want to cry, I tell myself not to give him the coin. The ocean keeps and keeps; I cannot keep anything from it. I get down on my knees, jeans biting damp into my skin, and whisper my own names. Sol. Mari. The middle one only Abuela uses when she is trying to soften my stubbornness. I’m twenty-six and I still bring her jars and money and my worst ideas for her to fix. I came here because of the card that fell out of her deck after dinner, The Tower, which was either an accident or a joke or a sign, and because Jude called me at midnight to say the kelp beds were strange up the coast, torn all to weird lace, “like somebody chewed them,” he said on the phone, whispering like he had a secret. Jude loves a secret like a lemon loves a knife.

I pour the salt in a trickle with my left hand, because that’s the side I lie on to sleep. Something about habit being a kind of promise. Something about promises being the only magic that matters. I never know if that’s mine or Abuela’s or a book I left open in high school and never finished. I talk again, this time to the water because that is who I am—a witch from San Diego, the kind that still carries quarters for the trolley, who doesn’t have a cat because the last cat knew too much and it made her a little uneasy, who keeps an old T-shirt in the trunk of her car for when the winter storms slap you and you give in and go, and then have to stop shaking before you can drive home. That kind.

“Not yet,” I tell the water. “Please not yet.”

The gull opens his beak like he’s laughing.

A wave shoulders another wave and they break together, slopping right into my circle. The coin blinks, lifts like an eye, and is gone. It happens so fast that I don’t even gasp. I just sit there with salt in my lap while the water moves back like a cat who doesn’t want to admit it cares.

“Take it, take it, everybody eats,” I say, and my laugh feels hollow. Across the street there is a coffee shop already open, bleary lights and a handful of old men holding paper cups like they’re candles in a vigil. There’s a woman jogging by with a dog that looks like a piece of licorice. The pier groans. I press my palms into the cold sand and try to listen deeper than the morning—under the combers, under the ratchety noise of the lifeguard truck, under the thing that woke me in the first place, the anxious little needle of it. I don’t know if it’s inside me or above me. I just know it’s here.

“Sol!” someone calls, not too close. I look back over my shoulder, pushing hair out of my mouth, and Jude is there, in a hooded sweatshirt that says Sea Dragon, which is the coffee shop he both works at and constantly threatens to quit. He’s holding two cups, the tops haloed with steam, and one of his shoes is untied. He waves the coffee like a flag. “Are you summoning or sulking?”

“Don’t yell the S-words. You’ll bring cops,” I say, standing, brushing salt off my knees. The gull has hopped into the circle and is stabbing at the line with his beak. “You’re too on the nose,” I tell him, and he blinks.

Jude shuffles down the short slope of sand, his hair still stuck in sleep spirals. He has the prettiest eyelashes of anyone I know. “You okay?” he asks, which is our oldest joke and our most serious question.

I take the cup. “Okay-ish. The ocean took my coin.”

“It always will,” he says, kicking at a lump of sand like he can bully it into being something else. “What’s wrong with the kelp beds?” he adds, then looks guilty, because he’s the reason I’m fixating. His face is a map of his thoughts and you can see the routes he takes to dodge something.

“You tell me,” I say. “You saw them.”

He nods, a quick flick. “They look like they’ve been dissolved by… I don’t know. Lemon. Or spit.” He snorts at himself. “I’m a poet. Anyway, it’s weird. I know weird in the water.” He glances at my half circle and the gull, who has gotten his beak stuck in the salt line in a way that makes me think a lot of things I can’t say out loud without making them real. “Stop doing that with your face,” he says. “It’s like you’re folding in half.”

“You always say that like it’s helpful,” I mutter, and we drink our coffee and watch the long heave of the ocean. “Abuela’s card jumped out like a frog,” I say after a minute. “The Tower.”

“Yikes. Maybe she sneezed.” His eyes are on the pier. “Theo says they’re going to close it again if the storm takes two more boards. He says they always say that but this time he believes them.”

“The pier never closes,” I say, hoarding my superstition.

“Everything closes eventually. My mom’s going to move to Yuma.” We both consider the desolation of that. We look at the gull again, because it's easier than looking at each other when catastrophe sneaks so close to regular news. “You want me to pretend I didn’t call you? And you can pretend you slept until your alarm and didn’t sneak out to do… that?” He gestures at the circle.

“I want you to pretend you're psychic and tell me the thing I won’t listen to anyway,” I say. He puts his hand over his heart like I stabbed him. Then he leans into me for a second, shoulder to shoulder, warm.

“You’re destined for something stupid and enormous,” he says. “You have the nose for it.”

“I have the my-mother’s-nose for it,” I grumble. And I do. It’s this particular slope, this way of smelling rain before San Diego remembers how to do it. Marion Vega had that nose and her dimple and the habit of tapping her teeth when she thought. She died when I was fifteen in a car that wasn’t ours, with a man we didn’t know. That’s the clean version. The other versions multiply like ants in summer; you shut a door and find them in your sugar anyway. It’s easier to say: she went west one day and never really came back. So I keep her nose and I keep the things that rhyme with it. Superstitions. Lists. Salt.

We walk back up to the street. The light is a better color now, less bruised. In the shop window, a man is kissing a baby on its ridiculous cap while a woman watches him like he invented that day. Jude doesn’t tie his shoe. He never trips, which is one of his many wrong magics.

“You coming by after shift?” he asks. “I’m making cinnamon rolls or something that wants to be cinnamon rolls.”

“I have to work at the shop. Abuela says there’s a woman coming in for a smoke bundle and she wants me to make the kind with the rosemary and the scruffy sage. The scratchy one.”

“She could do it.”

“She wants me to practice my—” I wave a hand. The whole of the word “discipline” is too big for this morning. “And she said the woman is strange.”

“Strange like cheap? Or strange like how? Like she asks for too many things to be free? Or like she collects teeth? Which is a thing, Sol, I swear.”

I unthinkingly put my fingers to my wrist where my bracelets tap. “Strange like, she smells like cheese.”

Jude laughs. It’s loud, and that’s nice, and the gull flaps up spooked, drops a bead of salt like a snowflake. “Okay. This town really is a salad,” he says. “I gotta go, I gotta open before Theo decides to downsize my beans again.” He kisses the air near my ear because he is a gay grandpa in a twenty-six-year-old body and heads across the street, waving. Ray of light, noise in my pocket.

I stay at the end of the sand for another minute and then I go wash my hands in the sink that never has hot water, wiping them on my jeans when the paper towels cling like jellyfish. On the walk back to the car, my coffee cools. A bus sighs by with only one person on it. On the windshield someone has drawn a mustache on the surfer decal and it suits him. When I turn the key, the car coughs like I’ve woken it rudely. I always feel like I’m about to drive away in a dream when I pull out of that lot, like the lines of the asphalt will move under me, like years ago when Jude rode a skateboard holding onto the back bumper and I was sure he’d become a kite.

Barrio Logan is still busy even in the morning—the trickle of tortilla smoke, the paint that never dries on that one wall where kids climb up each other’s bodies to write their names higher and higher. Our shop is tucked into a little strip with a pawn shop on one side and a hair place on the other. There’s a mural of a woman with six hands over our door. Her palms are painted with eyes and lemons. When I was a kid I used to pretend they blinked. Abuela says her cousin did the mural and didn’t follow the sketch, and that the eyes were not originally part of the plan. This is how things happen to us. We plan with one hand, and the other gets possessed by whatever is louder.

La Sirena Luminosa has always smelled like dryer sheets and salt with a little undernote of lavender that Abuela swears she hates, but she keeps adding to the jars because “customers like that scent,” she says, making it sound like an accusation. I have a ladder of dried oranges and a rack of candles in the shapes of things people like to petition: house, heart, palm. I put my bag under the counter and press the funny button on the register that sticks and see what comes up from the stack of paper I crammed under it yesterday. A receipt from the taco truck. A photo of me and Lina with our faces smushed together in the bathroom mirror at after prom. A napkin with a smear of butter. I stick the napkin back down and the photo in my pocket. I click my tongue quietly the number of times my mother used to; a static in the air answers me, like cling wrap.

“Close the door all the way,” Abuela calls from the back room. “It’s early, and there are flies already. The world is mostly flies.”

I do. “There’s a woman coming,” I say because I like the sound of making a story before it happens.

“There are two women coming,” Abuela says. I can hear her bracelets sliding up her arm as she moves. The back room has rugs and a big jar of coins and it’s always too warm. She comes out like she always does—like there’s a song she can hear that she hopes will stop when she opens the next door. She has a towel on her shoulder like she’s a bartender. “I like your shirt,” she says, which is one way she says she loves me. And: “This morning?”

“The water took the coin. Jude says the kelp looks chewed.”

Abuela’s mouth clicks open and closed. Her hair is pinned up with three brown bobby pins that all point different ways. There’s a smear of flour or ash on her temple. “You shouldn’t give what you need to the water,” she says. “It will only learn your taste.”

“I don’t know what that means,” I say, which is true at least half the time she talks.

“It means be stingy. with yourself.” She taps my chin, breathes. “The woman who smells like cheese,” she adds, turning to the shelf with the rosemary and the scuffed sage. “I do not know her. I do not think I have known her, but she looks like one I have met already. It’s possible she smells like the truth. That can be sour, too.” She hands me a bundle. “Make this one tight. She will pull at anything loose.”

“I can handle difficult customers,” I say, puffing up, and drop the bundle and have to crouch to catch it.

“You can. Yes,” she says in a way that makes the yes mean three other things. “Also Jude called me to tell me he loves you and he should be the one to marry you.”

“He’s gay,” I say.

“Please. Since when is that the only thing people are?”

We laugh, and then the door opens on a chime that is not ours. It is sharper, a little higher, like a glass throat. The smell slides in first, careful and insistent, like a poem. My nose tells my head the story before my eyes can catch up. It’s sharp as the rind of something hard and aged; it's soft as a stinky stripe unwrapped at a picnic; there’s a sweetness like hay and the whisper of mold—blue and brave. It makes my tongue waxy. It’s so unusual in a place that always smells like rosemary and stubborn women that my shoulders lift without me asking them to.

She’s wearing a yellow dress, a true yellow, not butter not mustard, not the color of eggs, a color I can’t name because it keeps changing as she steps through the doorway. She has hair that does what it wants and a face I want to rearrange the features of in my mind—like, the nose is smaller than I first thought, the mouth larger, the eyes a very soft brown until there’s light in them and then they are the color of amber so old a mosquito might be frozen in it. Her mouth has the kind of lipstick you don’t see unless you’re wearing it or kissing it. She carries a tote with a wedge printed on it, BASTA! CHEESE in a font that feels like it’s about to yodel.

“Buenos días,” she says, pronouncing it right and wrong at once, like someone who learned to say things late, who will never not be slightly amazed by a word on her tongue. She smiles. She does not show teeth. “You must be Marisol.”

My body calls me by my name in response, like the way you stand up when a teacher looks at you. “Hi,” I say, flicking rosemary dust off my fingers onto my jeans. “That’s me. Can I—?”

“You’re the one at the pier. That’s what they say,” she says, and I must look startled enough that she laughs. It has a small echo in it. “No one told me their secrets, don’t worry. You smell like the kind of girl who doesn’t sleep right.”

Abuela makes the sound she makes when she’s found a burr in the couch. “Can we help you?” she asks, a little too bright.

“I’m looking for a bundle,” the woman says, bringing her palms together like prayer and pressing them to her nose briefly as if she might fall asleep if she doesn’t. “Something with rosemary and, mmm, neighborhood sage. Not precious sage. More like a little rude. I’m Mireya. Mireya Moho.” The last name, I feel like she placed it on the counter like a piece of fruit she wants me to cut.

“Moho,” I say automatically. “Mold.” It slips out, and she tilts her head. Her skin smells like something that grew alone in a cave and wanted to be loved anyway.

“I don’t take it personally,” she says. “I take it chemically.” She grins, showing a tooth that is turned just slightly sideways, like a girl waiting to run. “I make cheeses. I think you know this. I have a table at the Little Italy Saturday market. You should come by. We all grow something.” Her eyes flick to the candles—heart, house, palm—and back. “I’m new to this neighborhood. I like to pay my respects quickly. The winds are wrong lately. Have you noticed?”

Abuela’s bracelets talk to each other as she moves. “We’ve noticed all kinds of things. We’re busy. Do you want the bundle or do you want to talk to my granddaughter all day? Because she likes to talk, and you won’t leave alive.”

“Oh, I’m not in a hurry. I’m always arriving and leaving at once,” she says lightly. “Bundles are good. But also, I think I’ll buy—” She leans in toward a shelf and inhales. She doesn’t touch. She’s elegant about not touching. “—this oil. And that candle that looks like a hand. The one with the chipped knuckle. It feels honest.”

I’m wrapping the bundle tighter than anybody deserves to wrap a bundle, my fingers doing that machine rhythm they do when I’m trying not to shake. The smell of her is not loud, but it’s thorough; it follows any space that opens. “Do you know Jude?” I ask, because I am rude sometimes, because I am trying to make her ordinary.

“Everyone knows Jude,” she says, smiling into her hand, then into the strap of her tote, then up at me through her hair like it’s a whole new person. “But I don’t know him. Not the way you do. Yet.” She puts a thin roll of cash on the counter and a small square wrapped in wax paper on top of it. “A gift. From me to you. A little Parmesan to make your coffee into a soup.” She laughs at my expression. “People fear what is rude on the tongue.”

“People also fear presents,” Abuela murmurs.

Mireya lifts one shoulder. My body wants to take a step back and a step closer at once. Sometimes I think this city keeps people who don’t belong anywhere else and makes us feel like the same-sized wrong thing—like we could line up and make a bridge out of us.

“You did not answer my question,” she says softly. “Have you noticed the winds?” No one who is from here asks about wind in the plural like that. The Santa Ana likes to come by herself.

“The pier’s talking,” I say before I can stop myself. “And there’s a… tremble. Like the freeway when everyone is smiling at the same time.” I dig in my mouth with my tongue to find a word I dropped. “Like the shore is reciting something. A first line.”

“Right. The winds are moving backwards,” she says, and her face doesn’t move much when she says that. “Everything is going to smell like something else for a while.”

She pays. She lifts the bundle, almost reverent. She does not wink. She does not do anything that twitchy women do to make you love them. She simply exists like a thing that’s had time to realize it has the right to be in its own body. When she leaves, her dress bellies out a little, like it has a weather pattern of its own. The smell of her stays. I can feel it on my wrists, in the little pocket of air between my top lip and my teeth. It’s not unpleasant. It’s just definite. It’s like learning a word so well that your mouth knows it without you. Abuela rubs the counter with her towel like she’s wiping off fingerprints.

“Do you know her?” I ask, and she gives me the face she makes when she’s about to lie or tell a story instead of an answer.

“There are only fourteen women in the world and they take turns being everyone,” she says. “Yes? No? She smells like the old churches we used to go to when we were pretending to be other things. Those candles that burn crooked. She smells like the way rot helps us grow. Teaches us to let go or we will be eaten alive. And also like the rich people’s picnic.”

“She’s a witch,” I say, because it is easier to label than to untangle all of the little strings. “She’s… like me.”

“She’s not like you. She’s like a rock in a place where rocks will eventually be sand,” Abuela says. “Be careful. Do not be rude. Did she leave a thing for you?”

I pull the wax paper parcel toward me, sniff it, and then I laugh because of course I do. “It’s cheese,” I say.

“It’s always cheese when she leaves,” Abuela says, like we have discussed this before. I almost say that—like we have discussed this before—but I swallow it, because sometimes the feeling of that trick is the way dreams bleed into a day. She looks down at the cash. She looks at me. Her mouth is a pen cap that someone chewed. “Do not eat it,” she says, and I nod, and I put it under the register on top of the napkin, on top of that butter smear I can feel with my fingers even after I wash my hands.

The rest of the morning is slow and then briefly silly. A man comes in and buys a candle shaped like a tiny baby and tells me he wants to stop his neighbor from drumming because he has a migraine and a baby would surely help with that, and he stares me down when I try to explain that the candles aren’t dolls. A woman buys a book because it has a gold snake on the cover and then tells me she doesn’t read but loves plots. A group of teenagers come in and smell everything. A girl with a scab on her lip says, “Does this have… will this help?” and she doesn’t show me what this is, just looks past me at the shelf with the oils like it is a museum of answers. I want to hand her my own front door and say, knock whenever you need to. I sell her the cheap things that actually work and I tell her to put honey under her tongue and then bite down. She looks at me like I stole something. She looks at me like I gave her something. We make change. This is also magic.

At two I take my break and sit on the back steps and eat the tortilla roll-ups Abuela makes me when she remembers. There’s a cat back there that belongs to nobody and all of us. It looks at me with that disdain that is actually a long love. I can hear the trolley thrum and the little clack of the neighbor’s wind chimes. When a gust hits that shouldn’t exist, hot as a breath from a person who has just told a lie, it presses against my skin like a warning. I think of Mireya saying winds in the plural. I think of The Tower card, that click of many things about to be one thing. I think of how easy it is to start talking to yourself without your mouth moving. I nap with my eyes open for a minute and see my mother’s hands sorting buttons. I wake up with the taste of copper in my throat. The cat is making biscuits on my thigh and I have to peel him off gently even though I’d like to be kneaded.

At four we are papered in light. The kind of light that feels like a polite hand on the back telling you to hurry up or the bus leaves. My phone buzzes. Jude: Come by. I made the cinnamon rolls into something else. I tell Abuela I’m running out. She watches me like the street might eat me this time, not later.

Sea Dragon smells like burnt sugar and tired college students. There’s a new kid working who gives change with both hands like he learned that at church. Jude is slicing something gooey and proud, a pan of sticky squares that could be rolls or could be a mistake. He bows when I walk in. He is a host in a house that is actually a ship.

“I met her,” I say. “Mireya Moho. She smells like a picnic you forgot in the sun. In a good way,” I add, mouth full, because the cinnamon whatevers are ridiculous, buttery, the kind of sweet that makes your mouth not know what to do with talk for a second.

“I knew you would,” he says, bobbing his head like a pigeon. “She came by yesterday. Asked me if the air conditioning is a spell. I told her yes. Isn’t it? She’s the one I told you about with the cheeses. There was a cloud of bees around her table at the market last week like a halo.”

“She left me a piece of Parmesan,” I say. “Which feels like sending someone a photograph of your mother. It feels… intimate.”

“Everything is intimate to you. I’m jealous. Tell me about her dress. Tell me about the way she said her name.”

I tell him. We arrange and rearrange the details like dominoes, making patterns that could be anything until they aren’t. He puts a square in a paper boat and hands it to a kid with a skateboard without making him pay. “Donation to the youth,” he says. The kid says, “K,” which is a blessing in a language I do not have. We talk about the wind. The air inside feels like it is still deciding whether to be cool or hot. If I close my eyes, I can hear the waves behind the noise of the espresso machine. I wonder if the ocean is doing that thing where, after a long day, it forgets to hold itself up and just lies there briefly and thinks of nothing.

At six, when the light has gone to that tin color that makes you a little sad, I walk down India Street to the end where the market packs itself up into pickup trucks. There’s always someone still selling something out of a cooler, too tired to make change with their mouth. The grocer with the peaches that bruise themselves with arrogance is like a king. His name is Salvador. He kisses me on both cheeks and says, “Girl, your hair.” Maybe it looks like a storm that doesn’t want to come. I buy grapes the size of thumbs. I find Mireya’s table because I can smell it before I see it, even in this crowd, even in this soup. She has wheels and wedges and a pale gray goat cheese the color of some polite disappointment. There are children tying themselves into knots under the tablecloth and a woman in a hat who keeps trying to make the words “Sharp as my husband” into a joke.

“You came,” Mireya says without looking up at first. Her fingers are a choreography with the knife, the paper, the scale. She wipes between cuts with a cloth she’s tied around her wrist like a handkerchief waiting for a fever. “I thought you would.”

“I thought you thought I would,” I say because I have never been smooth in my life. “I brought no money with me on purpose.” Jude is in my ear telling me not to flirt with girls who are not looking at me exactly the way I want them to. I wipe my palms on my skirt and try to look like a passerby. It’s like pretending not to look at your own shadow.

“That’s fine. We barter,” she says, slicing me a piece of something that is the exact color of the wall in my grandparents’ hallway. It smells like a barn and caramel and tears. “Tell me the news and I’ll give you something that will force your mouth to make a face.”

“The wind,” I say, because I am a joke of a woman. “It feels like it’s going backwards.”

She tilts her head. The knife waits. “I already told you that. Unless I didn’t. Unless I told you with my face.” She glances up at the sky like it owes her a favor. “The bees in my boxes were nervous this morning. They danced funny—”

“They always dance,” a customer interjects.

“Everything dances,” Mireya says. “But it was different. Worry is a rhythm, too. I can hear it from the way you breathe,” she says to me, suddenly, walking her eyes across my face, slow, like her pupils are spell pieces. “When do you sleep?”

“At the wrong time,” I answer, and it feels like a confession and a lie. “When do you?”

“When there is nothing else to do,” she says, like she has never run out of anything else to do. “Taste.”

The cheese is rude and wonderful on my tongue, like a person who meets your mother and makes her cry with laughter. It fills my mouth with something like a word I can’t remember. I close my eyes because I always do too much when I am trying not to do too little. When I open them, Mireya is watching my jaw move like she can read it. She hands a tiny wedge to a woman with a stroller and wraps two more in paper for a man with a mustache as if each piece is a story she is sending them home with, a thing that could undo them or teach them to say a different name when they wake up.

She gives me a piece of something softer. It sticks to the roof of my mouth. “I have a question,” she says, as if we are already in the middle of the remain of a game.

“Good,” I say, because I am always waiting for a question.

“Do you want to save the world?” she asks, as if she is asking if I want more water. As if she is asking whether I prefer goats or cows. “Would you make that your job?”

Beside us, a man drops a crate. A child screams at the exact pitch of a dying pull toy. The wind lifts, then lies back down like a dog.

“I don’t know,” I say, because the truth is louder than my mouth. “Yes? I think. Sometimes. I don’t also know what the world is. Or if it wants that.”

“It doesn’t,” she says simply. “This world does not want the saving you think it wants. It wants to be held while it does the things it will do anyway.” She shrugs, like that’s that. “But some of us are made to try, aren’t we? Some of us are born with a hand that will not stay in our own pocket. Sometimes I smell that on people. Sometimes it stinks. Sometimes it’s lovely.” She taps the knife on the board, tap, tap. “Careful. Everybody who saves something is also the one who opens the gate.”

I could ask her who taught her to say that. I could ask her what she wants from me besides the small power that comes from being the one holding the question. I could ask her where she learned to make a thing from warm milk that can be so sharp. I could ask her a thousand warm dumb things. Instead, I say, “There are seeds under our car again,” because I’ve plucked those little burrs off my socks three days in a row and I want to think it means something. I want to think everything is a letter addressed to me.

“Everything is,” she says. “You might not be the right recipient. But the mailman doesn’t know that. To him, every house is a house. You know?” She smooths the paper. “Eat the gift. Or don’t. But if you don’t, do not throw it away. You shouldn’t throw away a cow’s work.”

At home, night is late before it comes. I put the cheese in the bottom drawer like it’s a sleeping mouse. I take a long shower and stand in it past the point where the hot goes out. My dreams start before I lie down. I can feel them crowding against the outside of my skull like people at a door. The first one is always water. The second one is my mother in her leather jacket at the stove with her hair doing that thing that used to make me think she had wings. I am small in that one, smaller than I ever was, because I keep wanting to go backwards and forwards at once. The third one is the pier, the boards a mouth, but the teeth are coins. I step inside. They don’t bite.

When I wake, my mouth is slick and my hands smell like rosemary, like I fell asleep at the shop. On the ceiling, the light from the street is making the shape of a ladder. It crawls up and up and ends in the corner where the paint peels. I reach up like a child and tap the air. I can feel the edge of something. You know the feeling. Like the way you can smell rain in other people’s cities and know it is lonelier than yours. Like the breath you take right when someone is about to say your favorite part. Like the thumb pressing the dent in an apple and knowing it will bruise.

I drive to the pier. This is stupid; I do it. The night has thinned out to that time when everyone who should be asleep is either crying or telling a cab driver their best story. I park crooked and no one slaps a ticket on me because the world is too busy doing its thing. There are—no other way to put it—coins glittering on the wet sand like someone cracked a slot machine. A black gull lands beside me and drops something. It is mean-looking, this gull, with a nick out of one wing like it lost a sentence in a fight. It cock eyes me and the thing between its feet shines wrong, pearly. I bend. It’s a shell, but it has a face in it, or I think it does until I blink and it’s just a thumbprint. The gull hops to the edge of the water and back like it’s drawing me a map.

The tide is wrong. It is farther out than it should be, and then it creeps farther still. In a breath, it feels like if I take one step, I will fall over the edge of the world where it has unrolled itself and left a lip for us to look over. Behind me, someone hums. I turn because I am my mother’s daughter and I don’t believe in not looking at the thing that’s behind you. There’s nobody there. There is my car and the streetlight and the idea of someone who could have been leaning against the rail. The hum persists. It is inside my mouth. It is the hum my jaw makes before a cry.

“Marisol,” says a voice I have already named even before I hear it, even before it is itself. It is the voice of a radio two cars back and a voice in my grandmother’s kitchen and a voice at the market that knows what it is selling and a voice under the water that wants me to put my face in.

“You can’t sneak up on a witch,” I say, and my breath ghosts the word. It’s a stupid thing to say. It’s a thing someone would say when they want to sound like they own something. The coins on the sand shift like fish.

“I didn’t,” she says, and she smells like caves and picnics, sweet rot that makes your knees useful. “I just arrived at the same time you remembered I was coming.” Mireya stands next to me like that’s where she has always stood. She doesn’t touch me. She has two rings on her right hand and they look very dull in this light. “Careful,” she says, as if the shore is a knife. “You will fall off the world if you think it stops.”

“I know what I am doing,” I say, because I always do until I don’t. She hums.

“The world will let you save it if it can make use of the story that grows after,” she says. “Be sure you like stories. People will tell yours wrong.”

“Are you here to sell me something?” I ask, and we laugh, and the gull barks at us like a puppy.

“No. I am here because the water is rude tonight. I am here because I cannot not be. I am here because it is time to ask you to come with me tomorrow to a thing that is not your business and will become your business if you stand next to it too long.” She says it with the careless carefulness of the kind of person who knows the cost and is willing to throw it in.

“Where?”

“Where the river used to be,” she says. “Where we pretend the canyons were always small.”

I am not a hero. I am a girl who never learned to sleep right. I am a witch whose grandmother keeps the electric bill taped under the saints. I am a person who can hear a wave talk about itself and pretend it’s me. I say yes without thinking again, because it is a habit, the easiest one. Saying yes and wanting later to read the contract twice.

The world breathes a way I do not know how to describe. The coins on the sand settle. The gull shifts one foot to the other. The pier creaks an old man sound. We stand there with our arms intact and our hearts doing their work, which is to beat and to remember too much. A train howls all the way over by the tracks. A wind goes by hot as a dryer. The night sits on us for a second like a cat that has decided we will do.

At home I forget my shoes on. I am too tired to undo my braids and fall asleep with them pulling on my scalp and dream I am being stitched to the sky. My hands lift above me and I am sure I can see the seam. I am sure I can pluck it and open the bloom. I am sure the bloom is the color of a lemon that has grown in a shade. When I wake to the sound of someone knocking at the door, there is a moment where my body is not mine. It is a borrowed thing. It is a rented room. I ask the door who it is out the side of my mouth, and it says, in Abuela’s voice, “If you don’t answer, you are already lost.”

I open. There is no one there. There is the wind, bringing with it a little smell like the first slice into a wheel. There is the sound of the trolley going by, the lights making my hallway into a candy cane. There is the sheaf of paper under my doormat—flyers, coupons, a note in a hand I think I should know. My heart does a crunch. I bend, pick up the note, and it says, in blue pen, in tiny script that looks like it wants to be a field but keeps being a fence: you are late.

For what. I want to ask, but I know my mouth will make the wrong shape if I try. The kitchen smells like rosemary and the ghost of something long-steeped. I open the bottom drawer and unpeel the wax paper very carefully, like skin. It isn’t cheese. Not anymore. It is a little square of salt, compacted, so white that the kitchen light makes my eyes water. It is scored with hairline cracks that look like dry riverbeds. When I put my finger to the surface, thinking idiotically that I can smooth it, the tiny valley under my nail fills with a tiny hurt and I taste a very old word.

I’m not going to eat it, I tell myself. Then my phone says 4:11 AM like that matters, like the numbers are a code I am supposed to know. I put the salt square on the counter. I put my hand over it like a makeshift altar, like this is an alarm I can muffle. Outside, a gull laughs. Or it doesn’t. My building shifts like it is remembering a different city it wanted to be. I breathe in the warmth left in the room by whatever happened before I arrived at it. I stand for so long that my calves begin to throb. I am not moving, and everything is.

The note lies on the table. The letters look like a row of teeth. The wind worries at the edge of it, lifts it, puts it down. The scent of something fermented floats to the top of the room, then the bottom, like a ghost learning to climb stairs.

Sleep finds me standing there. Or I find sleep like you find a coin in the sand where you knew you would, where someone must have dropped it, someone exactly like you.3

Morning does the thing where it pretends it never had a night. The light is already too clean when I realize I’m sitting on the kitchen floor with my back against the cabinet, my cheek pressed to the lip of the counter like I’m a kid listening for a pulse. My jaw clicks when I yawn. The square of salt on the counter has pulled a halo of damp out of the air and made a wet asterisk on the wood. My phone wobbles on the edge of the sink, buzzing like a bee that got inside and can’t remember how to leave. I stand so fast that my knees argue, then grab for the note, the salt, my keys, the wrong jacket, the right jacket, my bracelets, the thought of breakfast, the idea of water. The note—blue pen, fence letters—lives in my pocket like a square animal. I hold my breath while I wrap the salt in wax paper, because it feels like it might crack if I exhale too hard, like old ice. It hums under my palm, or maybe that’s my hand pretending to be useful.

Abuela knocks once and lets herself in without waiting. She takes in the kitchen like a witness, her towel in one hand, her other hand already finding something to straighten that was not crooked until she touched it. She looks at the square under my hand, then at my face, then at the note in my pocket, which she can always see because pockets are for hiding and hiding is a noise. “Late,” she says, and it is not a question and not an accusation, just a weather report. “You dreamt on your feet again. You drooled. Look.” She wipes the counter with the corner of the towel, shows me the shine, the little snail trail of my mouth, grinning like I am a child she has just caught pretending not to have eaten the frosting.

“I have to go,” I say, because the words push on my teeth and will not be kept back. “Now. To the river that is not a river. Will you—can you—” I do not finish any of the three sentences I start because finishing is an art form I never chose to practice.

She looks pleased by something she does not tell me. “Bring a lemon,” she says. “And money, because sometimes money is the only lemon that works. And wear shoes like you lie in. Left side foot is the one you trust. Do not say you love anyone while you stand on concrete you did not pour. The words will stick.”

“I love you,” I say, reflex and revenge and real.

“Then say it again on the carpet,” she counters, stepping back until her heels are on the kitchen rug. “There. Now it is not borrowed. Come back before noon because I promised your Uncle Tavo you would fix his phone and he will not believe me if I say the wind took you. Eat something that has already decided to be alive. Put the salt away. Don’t bring it where the river used to be. It will make the old women cranky.”

“It came as a present,” I say, feeling defensive of a mineral, which is not new behavior for me.

“So did you,” she says. “And we don’t bring you everywhere. Not to weddings. Not to court.” She kisses my forehead like she’s telling my skull a secret. “Find your door,” she adds, because she has to, because it is the piece she cannot stop herself from saying, like a rosary bead that itches if it is not touched.

I leave the salt under the dish rack like a pet I am not ready to admit to. I put a lemon in my bag and the copper coin that is no longer under the sand but also is, because the sea keeps two of everything and I keep the others in stories. My car coughs and agrees to be a car. The air has that pink smell of apartments making coffee and dogs being convinced to pee. I drive with the windows down even though it makes my hair a frantic animal because I want the wind to say whatever it is going to say without having to turn the volume up. The freeway is already a collection of people having a lot of feelings out loud. A man in a white truck is eating a burrito with the kind of intensity that suggests he is making a decision bigger than the burrito. A woman does the thing where she does not look before she moves over and I do the thing where I love her anyway, eventually.

“Where the river used to be” turns into ten different places when you try to name it. It could be the culvert that hums behind the stadium, the concrete bed that was poured so nobody had to think about flood anymore, the flat brown slice through Mission Valley where the malls set up like they are certain of their own permanence, the estuary at the lip of Dog Beach where everything comes to an argument and leaves in a compromise. I make the choice my nose tells me to make, which is to go to the place where the water still tries to remember itself, the wide shallow place where the dogs throw themselves joyfully into each other and the river meets the ocean and they pretend they like each other even when they don’t.

The parking lot is already a circus, boards and boots and men without shirts returning from some proof of their own backbone. The wind is wrong. It’s east at this hour and hot against my jaw, and it tastes like someone cut a lemon with a rusty knife. My stomach does the thing where it thinks we forgot something important, like a child in a play who suddenly suspects the line is never going to come. I find Mireya by not looking for her. She is on the low seawall, sitting like she sat there before people learned to wear shoes, her dress replaced by something navy that shows her collarbone like a lyric. There’s a woven basket at her feet and a young guy with a bike asking her questions he thinks are charming because he doesn’t hear how they sound when they come out of his mouth. She looks at him long enough to rearrange his face in her mind, then says something that makes him laugh and take his bike’s sorry chain off and walk it away instead of riding. She looks at me like she is checking her watch.

“You are late,” she says, soft enough that it is not a greeting and not a slap, just a small plant being watered.

“Apparently,” I say, which is all the pride I can afford with the note in my pocket thrumming like a hummingbird. “You didn’t tell me when to come. That’s rude.”

“I assumed you would know,” she says, which is ruder, because it implies a faith in me I do not get to feel all the time. “Look.” She gestures at the brown river, braided with dogs and discarded tennis balls and children’s knees.

At first it looks ordinary, the ordinary wrong of a made channel, a place where concrete tries to teach water a new language and water, being generous, pretends to learn it while secretly plotting a return to its first tongue. Then the wrong reveals itself like February moths in a cupboard. The river’s surface is scabbed in places, thin plates of white that break and drift, not foam and not trash, a skin. A woman wading with a small dog stops and lifts the animal out with a yelp because the little dog’s paws have collected an instant crust that breaks when she cradles it, like it has been dipped in a brittle sugar. The kid whose ball floated too far shrieks when he reaches for it and the water stings him. He shakes his hand like a paper cut. The river is salting its own mouth. It is doing it in delicate, quiet ways, like a deliberate person. It is not all at once. That is worse.

My tongue finds the word before my head does. “Bloom,” I say, half to myself, and half to the part of the river that is in me and wants to be useful and knows it cannot be. “No, not bloom. That’s when things multiply on purpose. This is—what is this?” I taste the air like bread dough. It has that warm sour creeping up it, the same smell the square in my kitchen had and didn’t have. “Do you smell it?”

“I am a woman made of it,” she says, but not with pride. “There is a salt in the air that is not from this water. There is a hand in the wrong place. The wind is carrying more than itself. Look up the valley.” She points, and I see it because she wants me to: the far shimmer, the ghost of a cloud, except it’s not a cloud, because it moves like it has weight. It’s like when flour goes up in a kitchen in a cough and then decides it’s a weather pattern.

A ranger on a bike does slow circles like a gate keeper trying to find where the goats are getting through. He calls something to the woman with the dog that sounds like assurance and rules. An old man in a bucket hat shakes his head and tells his companion the river has been dying for a hundred years, that he can smell it in his knees. Two teenagers step to the very lip of the brown water and then step back like it hissed, as if it was a stove. The gulls are in committee on a light pole, discussing disaster. The committee has opinions. They always do.

“What did you bring?” Mireya asks, and I hear underneath it: what will you do when I ask something you did not think to bring. I pull the lemon out like a punchline. I have never been good at pretending to be anything but what I am.

“Yellow,” she says approvingly, as if color is all she waited to see. “Cut it. But do not put it in the river. We are not blessing anything yet.”

“What are we doing?” I ask, as if naming will make it smaller, or at least push it into a shape with a beginning and an end.

“We are listening for the door,” she says, because this is the city we live in and this is the summer we are having. “And we are going to look at something nobody wants to look at, which is the part of the river we hid under the road because it made us nervous to hear it at night.” She slides off the wall with the grace of someone who knows her ankles as if they were old pets. “Follow. Don’t step where I step. That is not a joke. We will both fall into the same mouth if we mirror each other.”

We cut behind the bathroom building and along the back fence where the ice plant tries to pretend it’s a civic solution to a problem. We walk under the shade that knows it is in a place shade doesn’t last. She does not walk fast. She walks like a person measuring something in her bones. We hop a low chain like teenagers and neither of us gets caught, though my jacket wants my elbow more than I want my jacket. She takes us to the place, the mouth of the culvert, the round dark where the river turns its face away from us for a stretch. It is a concrete throat with graffiti in a script that flares like anger and hearts with initials inside that are both obvious and brave. The air coming out of the tunnel has a temperature that is not honest. It is cool like a body is cool, not like shade is cool. Something talks out of it. It uses the sound of drip, the language of bugs, the echo of tires from the road above, the distant metal of a shopping cart trying to be a boat.

Mireya sets her basket down and takes out nothing that makes sense for a cheese seller to carry, which is how I know I am not wrong about her. A small mirror with a crack, a twist of red thread, a little jar of something that looks like it might be honey and might be everyone’s favorite lie. She puts the mirror against the curve of the opening so it looks like the tunnel has a pupil. I am not brave but I have learned how to set my feet so my fear has to wait in line. I cut the lemon and hold it like the answer to a question. Its smell is so particular that my mouth floods its own small ocean.

“Put that on your tongue,” she instructs, and I obey, salt memory banging into acid memory like drums. “Now tell me what you cannot see. Tell me the shape of the thing that wants to be seen and isn’t allowed yet.”

“Narrow,” I say, because I can feel it in my throat suddenly, a tightness where song gets caught. “Coiled. Polite. It doesn’t want to alarm us. It wants us to call it something harmless. It wants to be the name of a flower. It is tired of being a tube.” The lemon makes my eyes damp and the tunnel makes my ears ache and the river under concrete says I am not as big as I thought I was and that embarrasses me.

“Old pipes,” Mireya says, as if she is remembering a childhood specialty. “Old permissions. The right of way granted to a thing that was supposed to help and instead learned to rule. The bigger ones are down in the bigger valley. But every small mouth thinks it is the mouth when it first learns the word ‘open.’ We are not here to fight with a culvert. We are here to tell it where to go to find its mother.” She ties the red thread around the cracked mirror like it is getting married. “Hold this. If you see anything you love, do not tell it that yet. Wait until it tells you its name first.”

The air shifts. I feel it on my bare knee where my jeans are ripped like I am a person with a life and not a story. The wind comes in from behind us like a guest who brings their own drink. It goes into the tunnel like it owns the place. I am aware of my scalp in a way I do not like. I am aware of my tongue. The lemon is a sun in my mouth, burning polite holes in my certainty. A sound like a coin dropping runs along the concrete and the hair on my arms fusses.

There is a woman sitting against the inner curve just inside the dark, where my eyes aren’t supposed to be able to resolve detail yet. I do not jump because jumping would be rude and also because she looks like a person I have always known to be in places like this even when I have never seen her before. She is middle-aged in the way of someone who has never been allowed to keep a birthday, her hair braided with bits of ribbon that are too clean to be accidental. She is wearing a sweatshirt that says a school’s name that is not from here. She has a plastic bag tied around one shoe and the other foot bare. She is smoking a cigarette that is not lit, and she is humming a song that is older than the bridge we are under. She looks at me like a mirror, like I am in her lap and she is naming me in her head.

“You’re late,” she says, and laughter blooms all over my skin because of course she says that, of course everyone is reading the same script today and none of us got to workshop it. “You brought the wrong thing.” She nods toward the lemon like it is a hat with a feather exactly an inch too long.

“What was I supposed to bring?” I ask, already knowing I will argue with her answer because this is how doors and I talk to each other.

“A certain penny,” she says, and my stomach does that awful happy turn it does when meta catches up to magic and you realize you knew and did not know at once, which is the only way I can stand to live. “Don’t be mad. The ocean always brings it back if you ask nice. Or if you are rude with grace. Which you are.” She looks beyond me at Mireya. “You shouldn’t bring her here without a hat,” she adds, as if we are at a church picnic.

“That’s not your business,” Mireya replies, mild as a salt lick. “What do you need, tía? Tell me with your mouth or tell me with the coin that you do not have.”

“White,” the woman says, and I see her then because she wants me to. Her left eye has a little milk in it. Her bottom lip is split and keeps re-breaking. Her hands are too dry. She is the kind of person who knows every place the city left a hole and stepped into each one, becoming a stopgap, becoming the story other people tell about why they need to feel safe. She holds up a small square like she is an altar yourself. It is salt. It is like mine. It is not mine. It is flecked with something I do not like to think about. “They fell,” she says. “I don’t know who dropped them. My girls won’t step in the water now. Even the brave ones won’t. It hurts like lemons, but old. I thought, ah, this is the thing I get to keep, you know? This is the gift from the place. But it’s not. It cried. It cried all night. I had to wrap it in my T-shirt so it didn’t have to hear itself.”

Mireya puts her hand over her mouth in a gesture that is not hiding so much as translating. “Where,” she says, and that word is a question I have heard Abuela ask a hundred times in a hundred kitchens. It means map and it means confession.

“They used to put candles here,” the woman says, pointing at a little lip of concrete that is blackened, little circles of ash like coins flattened by trains. “For their uncles and their cousins and their boys. They put pictures. They put beer. They put a teddy with one eye. I put a salt square on top of the teddy and it sang. It sang wrong. It sang like a pipe. So I took it off. It laughed at me.”

I kneel because I need to be nearer to her feet, to the way the dirt has climbed her ankle like a river learns a bank. “I have one,” I say, whisper-small, as if the tunnel is a classroom and we will be allowed to answer only if we are quiet. “In my kitchen. It came as something else. It changed after and it wrote me a letter.”

The woman grins like I gave her a tooth. “You got a letter? They don’t usually write. What did it say? ‘You’re late’?” Her grin turns into a cough that bends her in half like a priest. I put my hand out and she does not take it, not because she doesn’t want help but because she has a rule about not taking help from girls she loves immediately.

“It said I was late,” I admit, and Mireya shakes her head with so much affection that it almost hurts in its generous hardness. She looks like someone is trying to teach her a joke in a language she learned by ear.

“Give me the lemon,” Mireya says, and I do. She squeezes it onto the cracked mirror until a bead of juice runs across the glass like an impatient child and falls into the first inch of tunnel. The drop sizzles. It actually makes that sound. It smells like a pizzeria inside a church. She listens to the sound like it is telling her a story. She turns the mirror to the side and the crack lines up with the seam where the poured concrete meets the older concrete with a plate underneath it so the whole city would not fall into itself. “There,” she says, not triumphant, just sure. “The pipe. They are pushing up through the skin. Something is asking to be let through and it’s too salty to be here. They tunneled the desert to our kitchen. Someone built a straw across time.”

“Desal,” I say, and the word feels ridiculous and exact at once. “Desalination. The plant at Carlsbad, the big one. They pull salt out and make sweet water and then they throw the brine back to the ocean like it is a relative we don’t like, and the current takes that and sweeps it south and sometimes the wind is wrong and sometimes they are wrong and sometimes the river wants to say a thing back.”

Mireya looks at me with a mouth that is on the verge of something. “And sometimes somebody takes the wrong pipe and puts it into the wrong mouth because paperwork is magic too, mija. We could follow permits like breadcrumbs and still arrive at a wolf. Or we can tell it, not here. Not today.” She kneels and puts her hand to the concrete like a doctor lays a palm on a chest. “This is the door. This is one of them. Can you hear her, señorita? With the ribbons. Ask your girls to sing for me. Just that one song that is brown and ugly and somebody’s grandmother danced to it and no one will admit it.”

The woman nods and hums. It is not the same song as before. It is more tired and more cheerful and that combination always makes me want to cry immediately, like a thrift store. The sound finds the seam. The seam hears it like a dog hears its name. The mirror fogs over. The lemon squeezes itself further into the crack because it wants to be inside something for once. I feel the hair on my neck move with the wind that isn’t there.

“Who are you?” the woman says, opening her eyes on me finally like she is introducing herself properly by asking me instead to be a person. “You smell like something that left and didn’t leave.”

“I’m Sol,” I say, which is close to the truth most days, and I can hear Abuela correcting me, and I can hear my mother saying my middle name like a song, and I can hear the tide lying through its teeth. “My grandmother says I am thresholds. And this is Mireya. She is rot. In the good way,” I add, and the woman laughs so hard on a breath that it turns to coughing again and we all wait for the cough to finish because it is part of the ritual.

“Doors,” Mireya says when we are quiet. “If you open, it will walk. If it walks, it will tell the others. If it tells the others, they will try too. If they try, they will fail in different places. We will be busy for a long time.”

“Then let it walk here if it wants,” the woman says, and she is not unkind. “This is the place that always gets everyone’s footsteps anyway. It’s already bruised. Give it to me. Give it to the girls. We will teach it to dance wrong so it forgets what it came for.”

I do not know if the world can hear that. I do know that the concrete under my knee hums like a grandmother trying not to laugh. I do know that the lemon smell is suddenly both delicious and unbearable. I do know that I can feel the coin under the water like an eye closing and opening. I take the mirror and hold it like I was told, the crack lined with the seam. I say nothing I love out loud. I wait.

The wind turns around mid-step like a person who remembers they left the stove on. It goes out instead of in. The tunnel breathes. Something gives that was pretending not to be held. The sound is small. It is the click of an old light switch. It is a knuckle being cracked discreetly in church. The skin of white on the river surface trembles and begins to move, little plates unceremoniously breaking and drifting toward the mouth where the dogs are deciding to bark at it or ignore it depending on their breed. The boy with the ball yells “Sick!” like it is a compliment. The ranger stops circling. The gulls discuss the change in management. The woman leans her head back against the curve and closes her eyes like the tunnel just pressed a cool spoon to her brow.

“Do not throw away a cow’s work,” Mireya says under her breath, and I fight the urge to say I told you, as if I told anyone anything. She pulls a small jar of something dark from her basket and places it by the blackened lip where the candles used to be. She unscrews it and the smell that comes out is honey, yes, but also dead flowers and beer and the sticky edge of love. “For the girls,” she adds, and the woman makes a face like she will not cry today if it kills us.

We sit on the low wall when we are done being in the mouth and pretend for a minute that we are pair of normal women with nothing to do but eat fruit and make jokes about joggers. Mireya breaks the rest of the lemon with her hands and smears it on her wrist, breathing there like the answer lives in her veins. I think about the salt square on my kitchen counter and whether it will have become something else by the time I get home, whether it will have written another note in a hand I can almost remember. I think about the gull with the nicked wing, whether birds hold grudges. I think about organs, how they never stop and then they stop, how the city is an organ we keep trying to pretend is in our own body.

“It will happen again,” Mireya says, not warning, not gloating. She rubs the pith into the pad of her thumb like a worry stone. “The pipe is not the thing. The thing is the permission. The piece of paper that says Yes, in all caps. The men who hold that paper are asleep in a way that makes them dangerous. We need to wake them or we need to move the bed.”

“Do we?” I ask, because sometimes questions are a way to buy time in a store where time is too expensive.

She tilts her head. Her hair catches the light and throws it away again. “You are the one with a grandmother who knows the names of small doors. You tell me. Do we wake them or do we move the bed?”

“I want to say both,” I admit. “I want to say, yes. I want to say I can do this without breaking anything I can’t fix. I want to say I am not the Tower. I want to be something that looks nothing like the Tower.”

“You are very beautiful when you are deciding something that is going to hurt,” she says, which is both an insult and a magic trick. “Ask your Abuela how to say no to the thing that wants to be saved. It is harder. It is my least favorite part of the job.”

“What is your job?” I ask, because I am beyond not asking that particular question any longer.

She shrugs one shoulder, as if she is trying on one version of herself and finding the sleeve too long. “I help things rot the way they were meant to. I make sure the wind doesn’t take something that promised to stay. I kiss the milk and the milk decides to live another life. I ask bees not to tell me secrets I am not ready to keep. I tell women like you what time it is and then I sit across from them while they decide to break their clocks.” She picks up a little square of the river’s shed skin with the edge of the mirror and doesn’t touch it. “And sometimes I go to the market and let rich people be brave in the small way of putting something rude on their tongues. Everybody eats,” she adds, looking at me like I said that first.

“Jude will make a song out of that if you give him a pen,” I say. “And if you say my face is beautiful again when I am about to do something stupid, he will steal you and tell you all his worst ideas. I won’t save you from that. He is my favorite bully.”

“I do not need saving,” she says, and she smiles at me without teeth. “But I do like to be told no. Practicing consent is a game we can make holy.” She stands, smooths her dress, re-ties the basket handle like it matters how it rests on her palm. “Come to my table at the market Saturday. Bring your coin if the ocean gives it back. Bring the salt if you have lost the coin. If you bring neither, bring your mouth. I will give you something that will remind you of the desert and of your mother. You will hate me a little. That will be useful.”

“I don’t hate easily,” I say, and she lifts an eyebrow in the exact way a door does when it is not sure yet if it will open.

“Everyone hates easily,” she contradicts gently. “We are just very good at not telling the truth about it. That is all. Tell Jude I said he has very good wrists.”

“That will be the end of me,” I say, because if Jude’s wrists enter the chat we will be here all day. She breaks into laughter that sounds like a spoon clinking against glass and I love her suddenly for a full second enough to be frightened by it. My mother loved like that, all at once, and looked at the mess after like it was a mural she had commissioned without seeing the sketch.

We part like a tide parting from a shore that is not done with her. I stand and watch the river behave for a few breaths like a child trying to impress a teacher. The woman in the tunnel hums still, or maybe the tunnel hums and I have given it the credit. I text Jude because I need to hear his ridiculous keyboard clicks, and he writes back immediately like his phone is a lizard he wears around his neck. He says, bring me a story. He says, bring me your face. He says, I am learning to frost a cake that does not want to be frosted. He sends a picture of his hands covered in sugar like he murdered a snowman. He is the thing I bring to everything because he is always a door in the other direction.

Back at La Sirena Luminosa, Abuela has rearranged the candle shelf in a way that looks random if you are new and like a chant if you are not. She does not look up when I come in, which is how she says I have not died. She continues to wind string around the fat belly of a jar like she is swaddling something that keeps trying to be born.

“Don’t say it,” I tell her, but I am smiling because I want her to say it and then I can argue with her like a child and feel for two minutes like the world is nothing but light and chores.

“You’re late,” she says dutifully, and I present my hands for inspection because I am a person who still wants to be graded on a curve. She turns them over, sniffing the lemon in my skin and the tunnel on my knuckles. She presses my thumb until the print shows blood a little. She nods. “Good. You didn’t put your love on the concrete. I can hear the lemon laughing.”

“The river is salting up,” I report, sliding the mirror onto the counter because there is nowhere else for it to be right now, because my pockets have become places I do not trust with glass and old songs. “The wind carried it wrong. Or right. Or both, if you ask someone who likes to watch small things suffer. We told it where to go. It went a little.”

“It will come back a lot,” she says, as if I did not expect that. “Salt is the part of the story that writes itself. Did Mireya kiss anything that does not belong to her?”

“She kissed her wrist,” I say, which is partly mischief and partly trying to share the awe. “She is a door that thinks it’s a window, Abuela. She makes me want to pull my own head off and look inside just to see how I’m built.”

“That is sex,” Abuela says dryly, and I choke on a piece of air because she is not wrong and she will be merciless about it if I tell her she is right. “Be careful. Mold does not belong to anyone. It will send a letter to the person who thinks they own it and sign it with a drawing of a goat. You will have to frame it.”

“She says everyone hates easily,” I tell her, hanging my jacket on the hook where my jacket always falls off because this is how my life reminds me to pay attention in increments. “She says I’m beautiful when I am deciding to be hurt.”

“You are,” Abuela says, not even glancing up, and I try to pretend that is not a knife but I can feel its edge. “Help me with this string. Your Uncle will be obnoxious about the phone and then he will make us soup that is too salty and then we will fight and then we will kiss his head and tell him to go. The woman with the lip will come back and she will want a different oil with a snake on it. The world is going to tip and we will keep sweeping during the tipping because that is what we do. Don’t bring that salt into my bedroom. It will make the saints snore.”

“It wrote me a letter,” I say again, because some things I have to say twice to believe they became sentences and not dreams. “It will write another. I can feel it deciding how to spell me.”

“Good,” she says. “If a thing writes you, you can write back.”

The afternoon is the color of a nap we will not get to take. People come in with their needs folded into their wallets, into their palms, into the flares of anger around their mouths. I make bundles with my left hand because habits are promises and promises are magic and we are doing tiny magic while the big magic adjusts its skirt and sits down hard somewhere nobody expected. I keep finding salt on my clothes where salt should not be. In the bathroom mirror, my face looks like it is about to say something I am not sure I want to hear. My phone pings with an unknown number that I do not answer because I am brave in exactly this one way.

After closing, Jude swings in like he was caught in a net that he was excited to be caught in. He smells like burnt sugar and the rain that forgot to happen. He leans over the counter and bites my forearm because he is a feral child from a nice family and I love him. He says, tell me. I tell him. He says, oh. He says, oh. He says, I had a dream where I was a jar and someone kept putting different things in me and forgetting what they were and I think I woke up as a refrigerator. He says, I like the lady who is a salad. He says, does she have a brother? He says, do not look at me like that or I will steal your grandmother and make her my husband.

“You are not allowed to marry Abuela,” I say, correcting him because petty is a language we learned together. “And if you try, the saints will come off the wall and put you in an old jar forever. You will have a label but no expiration date.”

“Sexy,” he says, reading his own heartbeat like a gossip column. “So Saturday, yes? We go to her table and pretend not to be poor. We will wear hats.”

“We will wear hats,” I agree, and the word hat feels like an amulet that got cheap in the wash and still works a little. “Bring your wrists. She will give them a compliment.”

He looks at his wrists like he just owned them. “They have been waiting for validation from mold. Honestly, haven’t we all?”

Night comes back around with its pockets full of change. The pier is a sentence waiting for its verb. The wind pretends it has always come from this direction. I take the salt square out of its wax again when I get home and hold it in my palm like a small animal that would like to be a stone. It has made a little damp around itself on the dish towel. It is scored more deeply than it was before, like a map remembering its river. I bring it to my nose like a fool and of course it makes my mouth flood, of course it makes me think of every bad kiss I ever had and all the good ones I did not have yet. On the table, the note lies under the pepper grinder. It has bled a little where the blue pen met a drop of water. “you are late,” it says, and then in tiny script on the back that my eye skipped until it did not: “we waited anyway.”

I am not crying when I lie down. I refuse. My eyelids dampen on their own like the city dew. My dreams are not water this time. They are brick and line and gate and a list of words that all mean door in a language I have to learn by sleeping. When I wake at 3:03, for no reason, with my hands above my head like I’ve been surrendering in a more fun place, the apartment smells like lemon and like something that learned to be itself without my permission. The trolley goes by and the whole building wants to hum along. My mother’s jacket hangs on the closet door like a person. I say her name into the pillow because the pillow will not judge my accent. The wind lays its weight on the window and then rolls off, satisfied.

On Saturday, we will go to the market with hats and wrists and smell the bees thinking. Today, the city holds her breath and lets it go and holds it again. Somewhere, a pipe shifts in its sleep. Somewhere, a gull steals a coin. Somewhere, a girl drops a candle in the wrong place and finds herself loved anyway. The river remembers, just a little. The lemons on my counter turn their faces to the window. The square in my kitchen listens, and when I touch it, it is not cold anymore. It is the temperature of a hand. It is a letter that has added a line. It says, if you open, walk. It says, if you close, sing. It says, we will use your name when we have to and not before. It says, try to be on time.Saturday pretends to be casual and fails. The light is loud already when I open my eyes and the salt square on the counter has made a ring like a wedding on the wood, a perfect pale halo that makes me feel guilty for having dropped oil near it ever in my life. The note under the pepper has bled itself into legibility, party trick, and added a line that looks like a mouth in profile. I brush my teeth and it tastes like I have been eating ocean air. Abuela is humming in the living room, an old song that makes the carpet look like it might decide to be a field. She holds up two hats when I come out, one with a brim like a plate you could serve oranges on and one with a bruise at the crown where somebody once loved it hard.

“Wear the ugly one,” she says, not even pretending I get a choice. “Someone will give you a compliment because they think you need one.”

“It’s very direct,” I say, putting on the hat that looks like it has a history and letting it sit too far back on my head because I always forget that hats have laws. “The salt wrote again.”

“It will,” she says, as if I told her the dryer finished its cycle. “Do not bring it. If it misses you, it will find your wrist. Eat something that has a grandmother. No smoothies.”

I eat an egg that likes me back and a piece of bread that Abuela toasts in a pan like a person who never learned to trust appliances. The phone buzzes with Jude telling me he is bringing a hat that is technically a costume and that he will be late on purpose so we can arrive like a pair of people who do not care. I put a lemon in my bag and a handful of quarters because nothing good ever came of pretending you couldn’t buy parking if you needed to. The coin that is not mine yet not gone is a weight in my hope, a bruise I poke with my tongue. The mirror goes into the bag too, wrapped in the red scarf I stole from Lina the year we decided to be women with scarves and failed by Thursday.

Jude is already on the curb outside my building, obviously early, wearing something that looks like he raided a costume shop for a gardener who is also a well-paid witch. The hat is a floppy green thing that sits on his skull like a pet. His wrists are on purpose. He twirls when he sees me because he is a weather vane for approval.

“Wrists?” he asks, thrusting his arms out like offerings.

“Exquisite. The mold will propose,” I say, and he clutches his throat like a maiden and slips into the passenger seat with a noise that is either a sigh or the hot coffee stabbing him in the thigh through the paper cup.

Little Italy pretends it is a village and does a good job for the first hour of the market, when the white tents are still crisp and the wind has not yet decided to flirt with anything expensive. Salvador waves a peach at me like it’s a warning and I buy two because his eyes are irresistible in their pitying disdain. The air is already making a decision about direction; it comes from the east and then the west in one breath, doors misaligning, and you can feel people’s hair arguing with itself in their shadows. Jude is already coveting a cake he will regret smelling.

Mireya’s table is a map made of wedges. She has the yellow dress again but it has a denim apron over it with flour ground into the seam, and her hair is an argument with her hat that the hat is losing. Bees orbit in a wide calm ring that reads as planned to anyone who hasn’t had them baptize their scalp. A sign hangs from the canopy with the goat drawing she mentioned, and the font on BASTA! CHEESE is somehow both angry and charming in a way that makes you open your wallet faster because you feel flattered by your own cheekbones. She does not look up when we arrive, which means she sees us without eyes.

“Wrists,” she says, and Jude preens like a cat accepting praise from a statue. “Let me see. Mmm. These are bread-cutter wrists. Useful.”

“You cannot say that to him,” I scold, but I am laughing because he has framed his hands in the air like a museum hang.

“I brought my mouth,” I say, offering it like a sacrament. “The river behaved in public. The tunnel is a door that we told to go into a different hallway.”

“It will find another hallway,” she says, not put out. “Paper beats salt sometimes. It’s very rude.” She lifts a wedge with the knife, sets it on the paper like she is setting down a slug and a gem at once. “Taste. This one is desert window. It has the wind in it from a place where wind gets around with nobody telling it which way to point.”

The cheese does something to me that is embarrassing to admit in a crowd. It is dry and oily and there is a bright on the back of my tongue like the sudden memory of a word I learned as a child and haven’t had to speak since. It tastes like a lot of things I have never tasted—dust that has been kind, mesquite shadow, goat laughter, a hint of something metallic like the inside of a balloon—and it tastes like my mother putting on her jacket in the kitchen while she eats the last bite of toast over the sink because she will eat properly later, she swears. Jude’s eyes go huge because he is watching my face like a movie he wants to narrate.

“Your mother?” he says softly like he has put his finger into a song and felt the edge.

“She smoked cigarettes in the doorway,” I say, the fact rising up like a fish. “She told me to practice doing nothing with purpose. She said otherwise everything would slide together and I would have no handholds. She could peel an orange without breaking the peel. She never saved a bag.”

“Ah,” Mireya says, and the ah is not pity and not interest and simply room. “Good. Your mouth remembers. This will help you be impolite to the right people.”

A booth three tents down is a little universe that looks like it hates us. There is a backdrop with a photo of the ocean turned into a smiling faucet. A banner reads COUNTY WATER SOLUTIONS in a font that is polite the way a door that has been oiled is polite. A woman with a polo shirt and a tiny microphone kisses the air with her hand gestures as she says the words Community Stewardship and Environmental Compliance and Tours Available. The table has a fishbowl full of pens and a stack of flyers with a cartoon droplet wearing sunglasses. You can smell toner and the ghost of electrical fires. Paper is a spell; you can see the edges of it like heat waves, how it quivers around them. A man with a clipboard and a posture like he has never run unless chased points out a diagram to a grandfather who nods like he is listening but is actually hearing the tambor in his blood because there is a band tuning up by the fountain.

“They set up here every third Saturday,” the woman to the left of us says, sotto voce in the way of someone who loves gossip and hates conflict. She sells candles shaped like animals that look slightly melted and extremely loved. “They give out those drops and tell you to plant natives and then last year my neighbor got a notice that he was using too much water washing his truck and I thought he was going to die of shame on the spot.”

Mireya rolls her shoulders back like she is making a square for something heavy to sit on. “Go listen,” she murmurs to me. “Don’t speak. Not yet. If you speak too soon, paper will make you promise something you can’t keep.”

Jude has already wandered over with the bright idiot fearlessness that has gotten him out of more trouble than it gets him into. He collects a sticker for me that says I HEART RESPONSIBLE REHYDRATION and three pens that probably dry up before we get to the car. The woman with the mic smiles at me like she is tired of smiling and too well-trained to stop. Her hair is the exact color of a fence made new. Her nametag says KRISTIN with a K that strains to be formal and begs to be liked.

“Have you heard about our ocean-to-glass initiative?” she asks, and I do not say, yes, I had it in my mouth last night and it tasted like a question we should have asked thirty years ago. I take the flyer. The paper hums like a refrigerator, very faint, just enough to call insects and people who like to fill out surveys.

“What happens to the salt?” I ask, because not speaking is not an art I practice well.

“It’s returned,” she says, and she says it like a lullaby. “Return is the most natural thing in the world. We return. The sea returns. It’s a circle.”

“Sometimes circles are cages,” Jude says cheerfully, because he has never been able to stop himself from bending language back on the person who made it. “Sometimes returning is just called not leaving.”

Kristin’s smile clicks an inch tighter. She does not flinch. She taps a laminated photo of the plant where it looks like a very clean hospital that happens to be married to a very enthusiastic pipe. “We disperse at a rate that meets and exceeds state standards,” she says, and you can hear her audit feel proud. “The brine comes out perfect. It gets mixed before it can become a problem. We are committed.”

“To what?” I ask, and her eyes do a thing like a coin rolling and then lying flat.

“To working with community members,” she says finally, which is very nearly a sentence. “We have tours.”

“I like tours,” Jude says, inventing himself as a person who likes tours because the idea of infiltrating anything in a legal way gives him sugar highs. “Do we get to see the pipe? Do we get to taste anything? Do we get to ask the pipe about its feelings?”

Kristin laughs as if he has made the same joke she has heard twelve times and still wants to like. “We have safety guidelines.”

“Paper,” whispers Mireya behind me, the word both warning and caress. She is holding a jar of honey near her shoulder and the bees have begun to lightly test the air around it like a necklace. I can feel a shift in the light like a cloud snuck into the market without paying. When I glance down the aisle, I see spilled salt, except it is not spilled, it is falling, soft, a faint sift of white that makes people squint and look up like they will catch a flake on their tongue. It is so slight that your brain wants to call it dust because dust is the polite way to name the odd things the world does when you are not watching.

The first bee that hits my cheek does not sting. It lands and lifts and lands like it is unsure of the floor. The second one is drunk with the wrong air. Mireya’s shoulders change shape. The jar disappears into the basket so the nectar is not a song in the wrong room. The bees get confused but not mean. They rise higher, their circle tilting, a soft felony in the air. People tug hats, laugh in the tense way that means a story later if it goes right, a siren if it goes wrong.

“Sugar,” Jude says, like a prayer and like a curse at once, and then his body finds its place the way his body always does around spills. He pulls his squeeze bottle from his satchel because there is always a squeeze bottle in his satchel and mists a veil around us. The air catches it and brings it back down a few inches away, and the bees do exactly what they do when you distract them with work—they slow, momentarily befriended by the task of cleaning their sisters, tongues out like secrets, feet moving on their faces like handkerchiefs. Mireya’s voice is small and specific, humming a shape in her throat that lets the bees put their heads on it.

The drift of white is not ash. It is salt, so fine that my lips taste it and my eyes water without my consent. It catches in the corners of signs and lies along the edge of the tent like the sign of a church that forgot itself on a weekday. People begin to say the word weird in voices that want to be brave. Kristin’s mic picks up the catch in her breath and broadcasts it. I want to put my hands on the legs of the canopy because I suddenly love the idea of a roof with a purpose so hard it makes my fingernails hurt. The salt makes patterns on the pavement where coffee spilled earlier and I see the river in the city where there is not one, little tributaries of this unwanted weather.

“Sing,” the note at home says to the part of me that is willing to take instruction like a wild plant. Open, walk. Close, sing. If I open here, everything walks, and not all of it knows where it is going. If I close, somebody will call me selfish. I put my mouth to the idea of a song and my throat refuses to be pretty. Mireya hears that and smiles with her eyes.

“Ugly,” she says, approving, and I find the tune that lives in the kitchen when the pot refuses to boil. It is the song with no words that Abuela uses to tell the rice to stay soft even though she took her eye off it for a minute to yell at the radio. Jude catches it in his mouth like a penny and hums too, a lower line, his chest against the table, his wrists finally doing their holy work of being hinge and hinge and hinge. The bees respond by becoming heavy around the honey they cannot see. They gather into an idea and the idea becomes a little living ornament on the edge of a sign that says CASH OR CARD. It is beautiful in the way a problem is beautiful when it becomes visible.

Someone laughs like a collapse and a tent down the row does the Tower’s trick. The pole doesn’t split and its canopy doesn’t fling itself dramatically into traffic, which would at least be theatrical. It just sighs, a simple failure of attention, and the whole white expanse slumps and then leans and then lays itself over a table of soaps and jams in an exhausted attempt at being shade. There is the collective intake of breath that a crowd does when it loves a little catastrophe. Nothing is broken because the jars had that luck you can’t pay for. A woman comes out from under the tent like a bride who changed her mind and thinks she can get away with it if she doesn’t make eye contact. The salt settles. The bees knit themselves into a quieter ruffle.

Kristin has not moved. Her mic has dutifully stayed on through everything and now when she clears her throat, we all hear it, the sound of a woman who has been told she has to start again at the part where she reassures us. She looks at me, which is a mistake, and then she looks at Mireya, which is a bigger mistake, and you can see the paper magic around her make a fist and then uncurl because it has been seen. Her voice wavers and then steadies. She asks if we have any questions. I tell myself not to ask one with teeth.

“How far does your return go?” I ask anyway, and the question is a coin that has been in my mouth too long. “How far, in miles, in hours, in wind? How far in fashion? How far does it go before it becomes something you pretend never started with you? You say, out at the outfall, it mixes. What happens when the wind is wrong? What do you call that?”

“Anomaly,” she says, and someone near us laughs in the rude way that means dissent. “We call it an anomaly. Our monitoring at the site shows—”

“Not your site,” Mireya says with the gentleness of something about to grow teeth. “This site. Your site isn’t the ocean. It’s your site.”

“We are in compliance,” Kristin says, and I think about the wind trying to find out who that is, compliance, and bringing back handfuls of her hair to lay on her doorstep. She leaves us with a promise to put us on a list. She writes my name hard enough that the pen almost breaks. Jude wants to put a sticker on her shirt that says we waited anyway and lives for the rest of the hour in the place in his mind where he is both a saint and a problem.

When it’s over, the salt scum along the tent edges looks like the edge of a bath nobody has drained yet. Mireya takes a dish of water from the woman with the candles and washes the little cluster of bees gently off the sign, her fingers like weather around them, and they shiver into themselves and rise, nothing injured by accident except our pride. I rub my wrists with rosemary out of habit and because it feels like a sentence I forgot to finish. A gull lands on the canopy and slaps it with his feet like a cheap drum. It is the gull with the nicked wing. He looks at me like he drew me and wants notes. He drops something onto the tablecloth and hops two steps sideways like a magician revealing a dove, and there it is, the coin, the exact coin or its perfect cousin, copper corrected by the sea, the face a scratch of a man with a laurel that could be a fish if you squint. The salt has crusted one edge into a ridged line. My stomach kicks like I drank water too fast.

“Rude,” Jude says in deep admiration of the bird, and I put my hand above the coin and then down because I am not going to play coy with a gull. It is cold and I am not. It feels like a yes I didn’t deserve.

“Do not say I love you on the asphalt,” Abuela’s voice says in my ear, and I swallow the words like a bitter. I look at Mireya because I cannot not, because gratitude is a hand that wants to put itself somewhere, and her face is a little hungry for me in a way that embarrasses us both, and on the other side of my embarrassment is something like joy.

“Bring it to the plant,” she says, too quickly to be casual. “Bring the coin. We will go on the tour. We will be good and we will not bite anyone until the part where biting is invitation.”

“Tuesday,” Jude reads off the flyer because he is nosy at an Olympian level. “Ten and two. We can skip work if we call it education.”

“I am a model employee,” I lie, and then when the woman with the soaps hugs her soap back into standing, I help right the arm of the tent with the movement you learn from making beds that never stay made. People look at each other dead in the face like weather conspirators for a minute, and then the market returns to its ordinary ritual of feeding strangers.

Mireya hands me a wedge wrapped in paper that says in a handwriting I recognize from my own skin, for your grandmother’s mouth. The bees are quiet now and one hunts my hat brim like it wants to sign it. We sit on the curb with our hats throwing silly shapes on the asphalt and lick sugar from a paper boat because Jude cannot walk away from a churro vendor like a decent liar. A child straps himself into a stroller like he is the bus driver to the day and the wind sits down for a smoke behind the post office.

“What did the note say this morning?” Jude asks around cinnamon and grease.

“It said I was late,” I say, looking at the coin against my knee in the light, loving it like a person I should not kiss. “And then it said, we waited anyway. And then it said, if you open, walk. If you close, sing. Which is useful but also like being told to be water and fire and to bring snacks.”

“You can do two things,” Jude says, and he says it like he is willing to do four if I ask. “You have a stupid large mouth. It’s a miracle anything stays inside. It’s my favorite thing about you.”

“The plant,” I say, because it helps to say it out loud, because paper magic hates being acknowledged by anyone but the people who wrote it. “We will walk in like we came to learn and we will learn and we will close our mouths until it is time, and then we will push on the part where the door sticks.”

“I will wear my nice shirt,” he vows, and Mireya snorts, the sound like the exact second a rind cracks under a knife. “She will wear her wrists. You will wear your nose. We will not look at anyone with love on concrete. We will lie with our eyes and tell the truth with our breath. We will bring lemon. We will not bring salt.”

“Do not bring salt,” Mireya repeats, and she is not smiling now. “They will notice it. They have dogs for it. Or paper dogs. Same difference.”

When I get back to the shop with my hat doing crimes on my head, Abuela is telling a woman about the way smoke gets into fabric and slowly undoes the part of you that pretends it isn’t hungry. She kisses the wedge through the paper like a saint’s toe bone and puts it on the shelf behind the register like it is a relic. She doesn’t ask about my coin but her eyes flicker to my pocket as if all pockets are transparent to grandmothers, a natural law they don’t brag about because why bother. We sit on the floor for a minute while nobody comes in, the kind of minute that makes you remember your knees have feelings.

“I sang in public,” I confess, as if I put a spoon in a socket.

“You will sing in a worse place soon,” she says, satisfied. “You will be so embarrassed you will think you are dying and then nobody will die and you will be mad you lived with that hair and that shirt on. And then you will be proud.”

“What do you know about paper?” I ask, thinking of Kristin’s voice and how tired it was under her training. “Not books. Paper that grows like a weed. Paper that wants to make a house out of a lie.”

She laughs, mean and full of love. “I know everything in this city was built on a piece of paper and that none of it asked the ground permission. I know the man who married your mother and father forgot to sign the right page and so they fought for ten years like ghosts because the paper would not let them stop being together in the only way that counted there. I know permits are like lemonade. They make everything look sweet and then you put your tongue in and it turns your face into a new thing. I know you can write a thing back. You need a better pen. The blue one is for coupons. Bring a black one to the tour. Make your letters look like a fence.”

At home, the salt has done another trick. It sits where I left it and looks exactly the same if you are a stranger, but when I lift it, the bottom has printed itself onto the countertop in a fine echo of lines that are not cracks but rivers. A child would call it a map without knowing it is a map. The lines are uneven, deliberate, the way a hand draws the same thing ten times until it remembers itself. The note on the table has more ink now because I cannot leave anything alone. It says, if you are open, walk. If you are closed, sing. Underneath, in the new tiny script that seems to arrive when the day has been rude, it says, you are not a tower if you kneel.

I kneel because it tells me to and because I am tired of being the only thing standing when the light goes wrong. The coin is warm in my palm, copper taking my heat like a rumor. The gull with the nicked wing will live as long as gulls live, eternity tied to a parking lot. The plant will open its doors because paper demands it. We will wear our hats like amulets and Jude will compliment a pipe and Mireya will smell like the inside of a cave that keeps secrets like seeds. Abuela will send me with a black pen and a towel. I will forget the towel and she will laugh and the brine will sigh at my ankles and salt will make my mouth honest even when the rest of me is dressed for company. The world will be rude. We will be ruder. We will be on time.Tuesday pretends to be reasonable by starting with marine layer, that eggshell gray that sits on the city like a napkin, as if the sky doesn’t want us to make a mess. The salt square on my counter has made itself at home, nested in its own damp ring, but it has the patience of an aunt today and doesn’t write. The coin is in my pocket, copper against denim, a temperature that feels like a small animal deciding whether to trust me. Abuela makes me drink a glass of water with lemon and a little honey, which she does when she wants my mouth to be sweeter than my plans. She hands me the black pen, the one that makes fences, and a towel that is older than all my good intentions, softened by so many kitchens that it knows how to behave without being told. She looks at me over her glasses like she will not say a word about miracles and will count the forks when I get back.

“Do not sign anything you do not read out loud in your heart,” she says, knotting her hair with one hand and the day with the other. “If you want to set a trap, do it where there are already mice. Paper has mice.” She taps the pen into my palm three times and then again under my wrist like a priest pushing oil into skin. “If you feel a door open and you are not ready to walk, sing and make it close like a shy thing. Do not be the Tower in your shoes. Be a woman who knows where the windows are.”

“Sí,” I promise, and she watches the word come out of my mouth like a smoke she is evaluating for heat. Jude texts me a picture of the green hat from Saturday upside down on his head like a turtle shell and I tell him to stop and also that we leave three minutes early because if we miss the turnoff I will never hear the end of it from the part of my brain that runs her own radio show where the host’s voice is my mother’s.

We drive north on the 5, the freeway already a necklace of unhelpful promises, the cars full of people having quiet fights with themselves about time and sandwiches and how to tell someone no. The lagoon mouths open and close along the way, Santa Margarita and Batiquitos offering up their flat brown tongues to the morning. When we pass the old smokestack near Carlsbad, it looks like a chalk finger pointing at a god the city forgot to believe in, and Jude salutes it because he is that kind of person, disrespectful and devout. The marine layer is peeling back to show a disrespectful blue that will make a lot of people brave later, in their shoes and in their emails.

The desal plant sits on the edge of a story the city tells about itself, all bleached walkway and polite fences, a shinily obvious future, the hum of water being told what to be and agreeing because rebellion is exhausting this week. There is a sign that has thought about flirting with us: Ocean-to-Glass in a font that wants to be friends with our grandchildren. A chalkboard tells us Tours: 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and the space next to it is blank like a dare. A woman with a lanyard sits behind a folding table that is made less poor by a neat cloth and a vase of suspiciously cheerful succulents. Her nametag makes her KRISTIN again, K pronounced like a consonant that’s good at filling out forms. Her hair is a good citizen. Her smile is the end of a line and the beginning of a script.

“You made it,” she says, like she knew we would not dare be late to something this official, and then we all pretend not to hear the little echo of her voice from Saturday where she said words that were meant to sleep under pillows instead of being used in daylight. “Sign in here and here. We have safety glasses and visitor badges for everyone. I’m so glad you’re interested in learning about where our water comes from.”

“Where it goes, too,” Jude murmurs, and I step on his shoe because our friendship is a sport with rules and because he will laugh and forgive me and then push harder in a different place like he always does.

The waiver has all those soft eyes in its language, the kind of grammar that makes you agree before your hand remembers how to write no. It says I acknowledge. It says I understand. It says I will not hold anyone responsible if my own feet betray me. It says there will be loud noises. It says I won’t take photographs of things that make someone nervous in an office far away. There is a white space for my name that is both simple and important, and I say it in my heart out loud to test it, the way you test fruit with your thumb for that sweetness under the skin. I write my name. I write my last name so slowly the pen thinks it might be a painting. The ink is very black. I make a box around a paragraph that I cannot agree to because it says I will not touch any levers and I need the option of touching something with one finger like you touch a child’s shoulder in a crowd, to say, wait. The box is not big. It is a neat fence. The letters I draw with the black pen make a little fence next to the words “return” and “compliance” and “diffuse.” I do not draw the fence around the word “tour” or around the word “community,” though part of me would like to chain-link those too, to keep them from being turned into excuses.

Kristin doesn’t flinch when I read one sentence quietly to myself. She is a woman who could sell me a ladder and make me feel like a good person for buying two. She hands me the safety glasses and they make the world look like the world, but squeakier, and I am always the person who makes jokes about goggles and then tucks them in my bag later like a gift because the future loves to surprise me about what will be useful.

There are twelve of us in this morning’s group, a cheerful ratio of retired couples with water bottles like talismans, a teacher on summer break who smells like patience that has been beaten into a shape that will not break, two men who are already asking questions about cost because they make friends with numbers to avoid the other things that want to hold their hands, a teenager with hair in his eyes who keeps his hood up like the world is a bit too bright, a woman with a baby in a carrier who is rocking a rhythm that is older than concrete, and us, three people dressed like a carnival that makes its own rules. There is also a man who walks at the back with a ring of keys on his belt and a hardness around his eyes that is less about mistrust and more about being tired of being asked to pretend the same kindness to the same mistake. He might be maintenance or security or the person who knows where the good cookies are and doles them out to the chosen.

We begin in a little classroom because all rituals start that way if they are going to work on people who don’t want to be taken. There is a video. It has a whale at the beginning and then a child laughing and a view of the ocean that has been made to look less like a force and more like a friend. There are simple lines that make complicated pipes look like spaghetti you could untangle if you had a mom who taught you that trick. There is a timeline that begins in drought and ends in sunshine, and there are a lot of phrases that talk to you gently about Responsibility and Innovation and Partnership. If you listen under it, if you listen where Abuela taught me to listen, there is a whisper that says, we are using bigger spoons to solve a hunger that will not quiet down. There is a whisper that says, we have built a bed in a place the river did not choose, and then we told the river to sleep there and then blamed her when she kicked. The subtitles do not say any of that, so I cross my ankles and hold my black pen like a cigarette I’m not supposed to smoke anymore.

The tour takes us out onto the metal grating where you can feel the hum in your ankles, through the room where filters taller than Jude act like polite bouncers, past the row of white tubes where membranes listen to water and tell it to shape up, into the hall where you can smell a cleaned kind of chemical that isn’t bleach and isn’t rain but lives at the party where they invite both. There is the control room with the glass wall like an aquarium, and inside there are screens, graphs scudding across their faces, numbers like very serious versions of astrology. The operators sit with their hands near their knees in that un-alarm that means if something goes wrong, it will be smaller if they get up slowly. Kristin is good at the part where she names the thing in front of us and then names the way it used to be done and then names the better way that is happening now. She is better at making me feel in on the secrets than I want her to be, which makes me generous and suspicious at the same time. She says brine in the way of someone who has been told to say it like an afterthought and not like a noun that gets to have power.

We stop at a window that looks out toward the lagoon, and the water sits there pretending to be a painting. The old smokestack is to our left, bony and ridiculous and somehow still something I love, and the day is putting its shiny shirt on by then, that tourist blue that keeps postcards in business. A gull floats by and stares at me like he knows my hair better than I do. He has a nick in his wing. He yawns without closing his eyes because he has bad manners and better things to do.

When we get to the part about the return, there is a diagram, and the diagram is precise like a turnstile. Pipes go out. They are bigger than my optimism and smaller than my dread, and they split like a family that never learned to share. Diffusers make bubbles into a necklace in the water where the math says they disappear. The line that shows salinity is blue and then darker blue and then normal blue, and the blue is a lie the way all drawings are lies that ask you to trust them. Kristin says “we monitor” with a smile that is almost a wince, and the black pen makes my fingers itch in that place where I didn’t know paper could sweat.

The paper door is not the sign-in sheet. It is not the tour waiver or the brochure that shows me a photo of a woman who looks like me holding a glass of water like a poster for good behavior. It is the binder on a shelf in the little administrative nook where the wall is covered in framed certificates. It is stamped and initialed and laminated in places where someone got very serious about their job and forgot to look up at the sky for a week. It hums the way a beehive hums when the queen is pretending to sleep. I can feel it as a pressure under my fingernails, like I need to scratch at the air to make something equal again. The man with the ring of keys stands near the binder like he knows, not magically, not entirely, but in that way of someone who has seen papers undo people and is tired of mopping.

“Can we?” I ask Kristin, and I make the word as small as possible, pointing at the binder with the pen capped, a child asking for more bread. “I like to know what the paper thinks. I won’t touch. I will only watch it breathe.”

“Of course,” she says, because she cannot say no to a sentence made of compliment and childlike curiosity, and she hands me the book the way you hand a stranger a baby, that mix of trust and terror. The binder is heavier than I want it to be and lighter than it should be if this is what it says it is. The pages smell like heat and toner and the way a room smells when everyone left it in a hurry and came back pretending they didn’t. There are signatures that look like birds and signatures that look like machines and one that looks exactly like a mouth. There are maps that refuse to be art but are anyway. There are words that make a fence around intention and then cut a gate in it that only certain people can see. There is the permit, the one that says yes to return in a paragraph that is patient and proud, and next to it there are conditions written like guidance and love, measured in numbers that make the wind look like a well-behaved dog.

I take the black pen without uncapping it because I was told not to touch and I am a good liar only in moments when it matters. I hold the coin under my thumb on the plastic slipcover the way you hold a thing down that wants to lift. The coin warms and then cools in that beating way that could be my own pulse, which is cute if I’m being generous and annoying if I’m being me. Mireya stands close enough that I can smell caves and bless her for not pretending to be somewhere else. Jude stands far enough that he can ask a question at the right volume when I nod. The man with the keys looks at the counter as if it might misbehave.

“Does your permit say what the wind has to be doing?” I ask, because the pen wants a yes or a no to bite, and Kristin smiles with all her training like she can make that answer into a calendar.

“We have monitoring at the site,” she says, and the phrase is a sink with the stopper in it. “We meet and exceed state standards. The plume—”

“Where does the paper say ‘no’?” I interrupt, because I can be rude when a door starts to open without asking my name, and I feel the bite of that in my tongue like a lemon seed. “Not that no. Not no to you. The one where the no is a gift. Where does it say, if this, stop. If east, wait. If bees can’t fly straight, reconsider. If your operator breathes funny, call a grandmother.”

A man who is not Kristin but is near enough to the door to be an important noun appears as if conjured by the sound of his own handwriting. He has a badge with a photo from six years ago and a polo shirt that fits the way shirts fit men who got used to having people at their desks. He says he’s the Compliance Director like he’s meeting a neighbor in a shared driveway. He says the word outfall without apology. He says the word variance like it’s a prayer. He says, “Our modeling shows—” and I say, “I know,” and I don’t, which is both rude and true.

The binder does not like the pen when I uncork it under my breath and make my fences on the brochure under the plastic. I draw a little box next to the paragraph that the man’s finger hovers over, a box that isn’t on the paper but lives beside it, and then I write in that box like a person who has a name and has decided to use it. If east wind shall exceed a mouthful, hold. If river shall put a skin on itself anywhere within the arms of this county, hold. If the gull with a nick asks with his wicked laugh, consider that a notice from the old managers. If bees cannot decide on a circle, halt until a woman with salt in her pocket says go, and if she has no salt, a lemon will do. If your operators look away when they say “normal,” tell the pipe to put its head under a towel and breathe. If a grandmother prays in a language you forgot, listen.

It is ridiculous and it is everything. It is not a permit, except a permit is a letter and I am writing back with my mouth and my memory. I press the coin into the corner of the paper that is touching the plastic that is touching the paper that is touching the law, and I say my name the way Abuela taught me, the way the saints are supposed to, first and middle like a slap and a kiss. The coin doesn’t spark because this isn’t that kind of story, but the metal hum runs up into my wrist and down my chest like someone tuned me. The man with the keys looks up suddenly and stares at a point in the air where a fly isn’t, his head tipped in that way dogs do when they hear a different frequency. Jude trips on air on purpose and asks the Compliance Director if the tours ever taste the brine, if there is a way to put the ocean back in your mouth with the math on it, and while the man is busy trying to make a laugh out of that, the screen in the control room grows a tiny flag next to one line that had been complacent for a long time. It is a square no bigger than a fingernail, effectively meaningless to a general public, a rubber plant brown that is not an alarm and not a compliment. I watch a hand in the control room reach across a console to silence something that didn’t make a sound.

“Scheduled test,” Kristin says into the air in that almost-question way that means she hopes we will let her keep her job. “We do system checks. It’s part of our…” She looks at the binder like it will admit to being a crystal ball, like it will read my fence handwriting through the plastic and punish us all with a paragraph.

“Of course,” I say, backing up like a woman who does not mind being polite and doing her breathing outside. “We didn’t bring salt,” I add quietly to nobody in particular, and the air in my mouth says, good girl, the way a wretched aunt in a fairy tale might say it when you bring her an impossible object wrapped in an ordinary cloth.

We finish the tour with our ears doing that thing where they tell a different story than our eyes and our mouths behave themselves. The ultraviolet room is pretty in the frightening way of anything that kills invisibles and laughs about it. The pump hall roars like a political rally, and we smile like constituents and pretend we like the sound. The outfall is a line on a laminated map, polite and accurate, and the sea outside preens in the morning like she always does when a camera points at her. There is a mural near the exit where a little girl puts a cup under a tap and the artist has given her eyelashes that suggest she is destined for the kind of trouble I make, and I refuse to take that personally.

In the parking lot, the marine layer has gone to powder and the sun is an actor who took a workshop and learned about making an entrance. I lean on the hood of my car because it is still too cool to burn me and look at the old smokestack like a landmark in a dream where all the landmarks belong to someone else. The gull with the nick in his wing floats above our hood and laughs exactly like he did at the pier, like he would have been a marvelous uncle if he weren’t a thief, and drops nothing, which is also a message where I live. The plant hums like an organ tuning itself. I can see the wind from here the way I can smell rain in other people’s cities; it moves in folds, it makes small holdings; it hesitates and then decides. At my hip, the black pen has leaked a dot through the wrap of its cap onto my skin, a perfect kiss of carbon that looks like infinity if infinity wasn’t such a show-off.

“Scheduled test,” Jude recites, mimicking that professional calm with a little wiggle of his shoulders because he can’t not, then sits on the curb like a child who would love this more if there were pigeons involved. “You fenced the paper and it made the boys press a button.” He wiggles his wrists like a composer did a trick.

“I sang very quietly,” I admit, the words reluctant but true, and I hear the salt square in my kitchen making its little noises like someone heaps sugar with a spoon in the next room. “The not-salt in the air is listening. You know that heavy feeling when the world is deciding whether to be so kind it embarrasses you or so cruel it makes you shut up for an hour? That’s this.”

Mireya is very still, which is how I know she is thinking in a way that might burn her edges. She looks into the lagoon as if she is looking down into a pot that needs another minute, reading the surface for lies. “You wrote yourself into a thing that eats itself for breakfast,” she says, but her voice is not scolding and not affectionate either; it is the sound you make when you tell a sourdough to be good and it decides to impress you with a new shape. “Now it will come find you when it thinks it should stop itself and it cannot help it. Paper likes women like you because you taste like rules and broken promises. We will make a habit now of going where you are called. I do not like it. I will do it. We will do it,” she adds, because she is made to say unhappy commitments in public.

“Saturdays and Tuesdays,” Jude sings, making a calendar noise with his teeth. “We will have a dance card.”

“Your wrists will be booked,” I tell him, and then I loosen my grip on the black pen and think about how many fences I am allowed to draw before I have to climb one and scrape my knees. The man with the keys walks past us to a little side door and glances at us and nods like we are mosquitoes that learned not to bite a baby for five minutes. I nod back like I am a person who can distinguish between being tolerated and being invited. I am not great at that. I am working on it. I am going to write this down in a notebook with a goat on the cover that I haven’t bought yet.

Driving south, the ocean on the right looks very busy in that fake way water has of pretending that what it is doing matters to you. The billboards are already yelling about insurance and ice cream and I know which one I will listen to. Jude is quiet in the passenger seat, reverent when he knows a thing has happened which is not a story yet because if we make it a story too fast it will turn on us for having bad manners. He touches the side of my hand with the back of his knuckles and it is deliberate comfort, the kind that does not announce itself like a parade.

I drop him at Sea Dragon and promise to tell Abuela the piece that will make her laugh so that she doesn’t keep the towel this time like proof that I live under her fear. The shop is a collage of the same faces again, and the same faces are new because the wind has moved and told everyone’s hair different things. A woman buys a candle shaped like a house because her landlord has become a different person this year and she needs a small permission. A man wants to return oil because it made him dream of a cousin he doesn’t want to see and we both pretend it was a mistake in the bottle instead of in him. The girl with the scab comes back to smell the rosemary and brings a friend who wears her sadness like a new jacket. There are four quarters on the floor near the register by the time I sweep at three and I take exactly one of them and leave the other three for the container that keeps its own rules because luck likes to think we don’t notice it.

When we lock the door for an hour because Abuela says I need to eat soup if I am going to be allowed to make any decisions after five, she makes me sit at the back table and watch the steam like it is television. The soup is indeed too salty because Tavo brought it and put his pride into it and then forgot to check the ocean in his mouth, so I squeeze a lemon over it and we both watch the little storm that makes and right away. Abuela takes one sip and makes the face she makes when she is thinking of my mother, which is the face of a woman who tries not to be funny in church and fails. She says Mireya’s name and makes it into a different word by putting her tongue on her teeth. She says Trouble like it is a new kind of music.

“She said we would go where I am called,” I tell her, because that and the gull and the scheduled test are the things I can say without the salt in my kitchen teasing me for telling stories in the wrong order. “She said paper likes me. She is angry about that, which makes me trust her.”

“She is angry about everything that thinks it can live without a mouth,” Abuela says, tearing up a piece of pan dulce like she is undoing a mistake someone made with a blanket. “Rot is a mouth. Rot is a mouth that teaches you to pay attention to what is soft. If you do not listen to it, it will shout. If you ask it nicely, it will whisper all your secrets into the dirt and you will be safe again. But you must ask nicely. Mold does not forget when you are rude.”

“Who will ask us nicely?” I ask, because sometimes the world can feel like a line of people who want me to line up behind them. “Who will say, please, to my face, instead of making a door inside my ear with a note that says late?”

She takes my hand and puts it on the towel like it will remember the shape of it and then we will be able to tell if it changes while we’re not looking. “You will,” she says. “You will say please to yourself before any door. Then the door will not own you. It will be a friend you can be rude to when she is rude to you. Now bring me that black pen. I am going to write a letter to whatever piece of paper comes for you next. I will say, leave your shoes at the door. I will say, wipe your feet. I will say, there are old women here who do not care about your job title. I will say, try to be on time. I will say, if you wake my granddaughter too early, I will make beans and not give you any.”

The salt square in my kitchen hums again after dark, and I go to it like a person might go to the mailbox in a small town where the mailman is your father and knows your secrets anyway. The ring it left has dried into a pale map that I know is a place but cannot place. The square itself has taken on a soft sheen that gives it a face in certain lights if I want it to, and I mostly do not. The note under the pepper has curled a little, the blue ink resisting the way paper tries to lie down and be less of a person. The coin under my palm is a truth I can hold, the copper always wanting to be more than one thing at once—a face, a moon, a bite of electricity. I draw a fence on my own skin with the black pen and then wash it off because I am not about to let ink discipline me. The wind is not done doing weird things in this city; it knocks and doesn’t wait and I refuse to make that a habit.

The day after the tour, the bees at Mireya’s stand at the market are unbothered again like nothing happened and that is a different kind of warning. The woman in the tunnel has a thermos someone brought her and her girls have painted a flower in the curve of the culvert that is so ugly it makes me love it more. Jude puts salt on his grapefruit because he is perverse and laughs like he is editing his own heart with a pen nobody can see. The gull with the nicked wing steals an entire bag of potato chips from a man on a bench and the man lets him because there are some fights we want to lose. The pier makes old man noises because it likes to make me think it could fall apart and never does.

I am not a tower if I kneel, the note said, and I practice it in my hallway where nobody has to see me fail in such an ordinary way. I kneel to tie my shoe. I kneel to pick up a drop of soup I spilled because I cannot talk without my hands. I kneel to smell the rosemary where it hangs by the door, the good petty plant, and I feel ridiculous and grateful and like the kind of person I used to make fun of when I was sixteen and thought rituals were just costumes and not love made into appointments. When I stand, the world is still the world, which is a relief and a disappointment in equal measure.

Three days after the tour, a piece of paper arrives folded into itself like a shy animal. It is not mail because it does not have my address, and it is not a note because it does not address me, and it is not a permit because it has no numbers, which is a shame because I like to count the kinds of trouble I am about to get into. It is slid under the shop door in that moment before opening, when we have the door open a breath and the bell looks like it wants to try a new sound. Abuela picks it up like it might stain her hand and then looks at me like I brought it with my mouth, and I did, by writing back to a thing that expected me to be polite.

On the paper is a photocopy of a map, the kind from when the city was young and men with mustaches made decisions on a Tuesday and nobody argued with them until it mattered. The river is long where it is not now, the canyons are bigger where they have been told to be small, the ocean’s lip is drawn like a skirt, and someone has taken a pen, not a black one, a blue one that lies, and drawn a circle. The circle is around a place I know the way you know the back of a person’s head in a crowd before you know their voice.

“Barrio Logan,” I say, feeling stupid and right at once, because the map is old enough that it calls it by a worse name and the circle is not on our block, not exactly, but near the place where the paint never dries and children climb each other to be higher. It is near the yards where they weld and the air tastes like work. It is near the freeway’s bad dream, where it runs over us like a decision that never stops making the same mistake. It is near the water, which is trying to pretend she is not pinned down. “It is the place where the river used to pretend to be a creek and then pretend to be a ditch and then pretend to be a storm drain and then pretend to be a memory.”

“Late,” Abuela says, but she says it the way a person says grace, and then she blows on her coffee like she could cool the city with that one breath if she wanted to try. Mireya texts me a picture of a culture blooming on a plate into a flower that looks obscene and proud and writes, it is time to ask the bed to move. Jude sends a heart, then writes, I have a new shirt from the thrift, it is the exact color of a bruise on a peach. The salt square on my counter makes its tiny noise and cracks one thin crack more. The coin quivers in my pocket like it is a cheap compass and I am the wrong pole.

We go to the circle on the map on a Thursday because that is a rude day and this is a rude job. The freeway overpasses tangle overhead like fingers that didn’t ask consent. The pillars wear their murals like persons, saints and women and the dead watching us with the relief of being above the ground for once. The underpass is an echo factory. The skid of skateboards is a prayer if you listen like you’re supposed to. Children ride bikes around grownups’ conversations as if they are planets testing orbits. The smell is paint and tire and mango and the kind of meat someone will yell at you about if you try to tell them it isn’t good for them. The wind cannot decide who she belongs to under here and keeps walking away and coming back like a lover with a math degree.

The circle is a drain, of course it is, a pretty one because the art students came through at some point and decided that even holes need dresses. Around it, someone chalked a poem that has mostly rubbed away, leaving only the words mouth and remember and stay. The grate is clogged with the kind of story that makes nice people judge other people—wrappers and cigarette ends and hair and petals from a celebration, confetti from a life. The world shakes off what it cannot keep everywhere you go; we just notice it more in these classrooms. The smell has that same wrong a note makes when you pick it out of a chord and give it its own room. It is salt, not new, this is not foam, this is not a prank, this is an argument that forgot how to be funny.

“Return,” Mireya says, the word not a question and not a complaint, and then in a murmur toward the grate she says destrózate con cariño, break yourself with love, and I realize she is talking to the kind of salt that needs reminding that not all destruction is the same. She kneels and puts her ear to the iron the way my mother used to put her ear to the wall and tell me which of the neighbors was fighting without actually wanting to know. Jude looks up, crossing his eyes to look at whichever seagull is trying to learn a new route, and counts under his breath, a baker counting for dough he will punch. I stand with the coin in my hand and let the black pen weigh the pocket under my hip because this is a paper place, a mean one, a legal one.

The grate doesn’t sing. It has nothing left for art. It slumps under our attention like the tent at the market did, in a way that hurts less as drama and more as fate. The smell stings my eyes and I do not cry because I can hear a child laughing two pillars over, and that is a fence you are not allowed to cross if you want to pretend you do this for anyone other than yourself. I flip the coin once and catch it, stupid thing, trick my grandfather taught me that made me believe I could keep luck caged for a minute. The metal is cooler under here and the face on it is smoothed into abstraction by the sea, so I think of it as not a president but a woman with a laurel who used to be a fish.

“What did the map want,” I ask the coin like an aunt who is a witch and a cat and a lie, “when it circled you?” I wait because this is a city where waiting is an occupation and because doors hate to be rushed by women. The coin warms in my palm and then in my other palm when I move it there and I say my full name again because it feels like a necessary indignity. I place the coin on the grate because I am a witch and a child and a person who believes metal likes to talk to metal. I write a fence around the hole with the black pen, which is nonsense and also ritual and also graffiti for people who prefer their revolutions legible only to ghosts.

The first drop is a joke, almost polite, just a little wet where there should be nothing. Then it moves like a sigh, skin trying to form and failing, the way the river did at Dog Beach, but this is not water doing water things; it is a mouth trying to speak and making a mess. The brine is not white here. It is clear and heavy and makes the air smell like a dead battery and a cut lemon at once. It is a visitor who did not bring a gift. It does not belong to this mouth. It is here because paper found a crack and water loves cracks more than it loves us.

“Sing,” Abuela says inside my head like she always does when my throat tightens with a brave thing I thought I wanted to do that turns out to be something I have to do. The options are always the same: open and walk, close and sing. Under concrete, at the edge of the shop, at the mouth of the tunnel, under the freeway like a kitchen under an armpit, the list keeps right on being rude about being short.

I put my mouth near and I do the ugly song again because if I try for pretty I will lie, and the door will like me but it will not respect me. The note of it, the one in my ribs and not in my jaw, finds the part of the grate that isn’t grate but a hinge, the part that remembers opening. The crack becomes a different shape, shorter and meaner, a thing that doesn’t get to be a corridor anymore. Mireya hums through her nose in a way that makes me want to kiss the freckles nobody gave her and never will, and then she takes a jar from her basket and unscrews it under the edge where nobody can see because nobody is looking at us hard enough except the saints on the pillars, and she tips a whisper of culture into the crack like a secret. It blooms so subtly it might have been imagination—no fuzz, no color, just a change in the way the stink sits, like the air just remembered its manners in church.

Jude does not make jokes because he can tell that laughter would be a wrong door, so he does his other holy work and counts, timing the drip to his heartbeat until the beat decides it prefers a different number. He concentrates on his wrists and makes his hands useful without touching anything, which is the trick of all men who do not want to be mistaken for the wrong kind of help. The drip slows. The skin makes and breaks and makes and tries to forget the trick it just learned. The paper that led someone to hook something into something under the street does not like us here, and it flutters in the pockets of the men going to work like a bird that cannot choose a tree.

“What do you need?” I ask the hole like it is a person, which is an insult only if you are a person who does not like being asked plain questions, and I am not that kind of person. “I brought no salt. I brought a coin. I brought my grandmother’s patience up to here and my mother’s terrible reckless everything over here, and I brought a pen that thinks it is a fence and likes to pretend words are animals. I can shut you. I can open you. I can sing or I can walk. Choose.”

It is not speaking to hear it, what happens—there is the minute change in the breath of someone behind me, the undercut of a skate wheel over a seam in the concrete, the very quiet not-cough of a gull, the reverb of the freeway deciding on a key. The brine stops pretending to want to be anything but itself. It pulls back in a kind of embarrassment I do not want to personify for it because I am trying to be kind. The compound smell dulls, then relocates itself to the place in my memory where batteries live. The coin jumps—really jumps—a millimeter under my palm and then lies there like a dead fish the way coins do when they are asked to be normal. The grate remains a grate. The note in my kitchen, which I cannot see, notes it in that way it has of writing after the fact like a mother who texts you to say she dreamed of you after you got home.

“Scheduled test,” I murmur, and I laugh because I cannot stop myself from making jokes that try to make the world feel less like a bar that never closes. The chalk poem around the drain loses the word stay to a skateboard wheel, and the child with the baby on her chest walks past us and says aloud to the air, “If you have to pee, hold it, mijo,” and I think, yes, actually, that is exactly what we just asked the world to do.

After we stand and pretend to be just women again instead of doors, Miriam from the hair place walks by and gives me that up and down that women give women they have known since middle school, the scan that cradles everything and complains about nothing. She says, “You look tired,” which is our hello, and I say, “Rescheduled,” which is our good-bye, and we both mean the part where the world continues to happen anyway. The bees, when we walk past the little citrus tree that someone has courageously planted in a place that will never be nice to it, are busy and uncomplicated. The wheels of cars roll over the same piece of concrete and you can hear them not making up their minds about whether to love it here. A welding spark jumps and falls like a star, and nobody names it.

Mireya presses her shoulder into mine once and makes the smallest sound, a human not-quite-hum that might be a thank you and might be a complaint and might be both, and then she stands away because we are not saying love on concrete today. She has flours in her hair again like she went home between the tour and this and wrestled a recipe to the ground. She will go to her stand and sell someone a wedge of something that will make their tongues decide to behave better for an hour. She will make jokes with a man who thinks he invented them. She will text me a picture of a jar of milk as if it is a baby and I will kiss the screen like a fool. Jude will go teach a boy how to frost something that does not want to be frosted and call it a spiritual practice. Abuela will tell a woman that her headache is from a man and not from the weather and the woman will cry and feel better and then worse and then spend seven dollars on a candle that will be very good to her whether she deserves it or not.

At night, the bottom drawer in my kitchen makes the noise it makes when something wants to be let out and is being polite about it. The salt square has changed in the way it always does—it has turned more itself by a hair, which is a miracle that makes me tired and proud. The ring on the counter is an empire after a haircut. The note is a weather report for my heart. It says, we looked. It says, you sang. It says, someone tried a door at your shop when you were not there and will come back when you are. It adds a line, the handwriting stitching smaller and meaner and prettier with every night: the wind will ask you to pick a name. The coin is warm when I wake and cold when I lie down, which is my own trick too.

When I do sleep, it is in the hour where late stops being a word and becomes a country. The pier is in my dream because it always is, and it is both falling and not falling, which is exactly like loving anyone, and at the end of it there is a gate, and the gate has a paper taped to it with my grandmother’s handwriting that says, close like a mouth after you take a bite. The gull is there, rude cousin, and he lets me pet the good wing and that is how I know it is a dream. The wind says my name, middle and first, and then breaks into a thousand girls laughing like they just took off their shoes on a hot day and ran into the spray.

I wake with a list in my mouth and say it into the dark like a spell. Bring the black pen and a towel and a lemon. Don’t bring salt. Wear the wrong hat. Don’t say love on concrete. Put the coin on the paper like a seal. Sing if you cannot walk. Walk if you cannot sing. Let paper be a person you can flirt with and say no to. Be late only in ways that the square allows. Answer the door when nobody knocks. Teach the grate its manners. Tell the culvert a joke. Ask the bees if they like your new hair. Stop at the market for peaches and forgiveness. Remember that you are the person at the pier whether or not anyone is watching and whether or not the tide lies to your face.

In the morning, the class of fifth graders on a field trip to the shop proves to me that the only real magic left is the noise thirty children can make with their hands when they are allowed to touch every candle on a shelf. One of them, a boy with a scowl that looks borrowed from his uncle, stares up at the mural above our door and says very serious, “Her eyes move,” and then shrugs when his friend tells him he’s stupid because he is not, not at all, not in the ways that matter. I give them bad advice and good candy and send them into the day with rosemary under their nails and the idea lodged in their heads that doors can be pointed at things and not only on hinges. When they leave, the quiet comes back like a cat that forgives me once a day for not talking to it the right way.

I wait for the wind to ask me for a name. I wait for the paper to try a new trick. I wait for Mireya to ask me for something I do not know how to give her and will find that I do, in the wrong pocket, in a jar in the back room, in a song I hate. I am bad at waiting in the way that women in my family are bad at waiting—we make soup while we wait and then we feed the city and the city is less mean to us for a minute. The world phones me while I am cutting string and doesn’t leave a message because she knows I will call back. The note under the pepper lifts its bottom edge and lies still when I look at it and I do not pretend to be surprised. The coin keeps its counsel and my hand keeps smelling like lemon even when I wash it four times. The bees memorize my wrist. The pier is the same and entirely different. The tower is a card in the deck that I have refused to lose and refused to draw and I can feel it every time I shuffle.

It rains in August one afternoon the length of a cigarette and the city acts like someone kissed it with teeth, surprised and insulted and hiding how much it liked it. The salt square glows in the gray like a lie that wants to be a truth. The paper at the desal plant has a little box next to a line that has existed for years and nobody ever drew in, and now it is there and we all pretend it was always there because admission is messy and recordkeeping is cleaner. The gull steals fries from a girl with two rings in her mouth and she lets him because she is trying out being generous. The woman from the tunnel hums a pickup line at a cop and gets away with it because she is braver than God. I sell a bundle to a man who looks at me like I look like his sister and for five minutes I let him and then he remembers his own and pays in cash.

We are not late, not exactly, not anymore, not in the way the paper meant. We are right on time in the way a lemon is right on time when your mouth forgets to be kind. We stand on thresholds like we were built to and our knees hurt a little and we laugh too hard and the city makes a noise like a stove cooling down. The wind asks me for a name while I am rinsing rice for dinner, the question so clear it comes out of the faucet with the water: what will you call what you do so you can say no to all the other names. I say, I am the woman at the pier who drops a coin and writes back to permits with a pen that thinks it is a fence. I say, I am Marisol who is Sol who is Mari who is the middle one and the end one and the one who brings extra lemons in case. I say, I am thresholds like my grandmother said, and I am tired enough to be beautiful when I do something that hurts. The wind says, okay. The wind says, then come outside.The wind’s voice is not the same as the ocean’s, and I know that tonight because when I step into the hallway with my shoes in my hand, it says my name like it has an appointment with me and not like it’s hoping I’ll wander past. It comes in segments, in square breaths that make the doorjambs quiver and the light over the stairwell flicker like it’s thinking about being a lighthouse and then remembers electricity is a job. I put my palm to the wall and feel the faint shiver of other people’s television laughter and the deep bass of a neighbor’s fight that is so old it has learned to only speak in sighs. The coin bumps my thigh like a nervous fish. I go down the stairs sock-footed until the concrete tells me it is time to be a person again, and I put my shoes on and tie them with the kind of care I reserve for a ritual I refuse to name. Outside, the air is a spoonful of warm honey and dust, sweet until the back of my tongue finds the sting.

I don’t lock the door because Abuela is awake with her rosary in a pile on her lap like a string of small headaches, and because the building knows my feet as well as I know its temper. The street is the sort of empty that makes you think you misplaced a holiday. A man in a sweatshirt with the hood up walks his insomnia back and forth in front of the liquor store, and a palm tree scolds the sky the way old women scold children at the bus stop for forgetting their sweaters. The mural above our shop is awake in the light from the streetlamp, the six hands looking like they have been asked too many favors and will answer anyway if I stand here long enough with my mouth trying to memorize a word. When I whisper “portera,” because I am not clever enough to come up with a new name and I am tired of saying witch to people who hear different music, the eyes in the painted palms do that thing they did when I was small and insistent, that soft double step that tells me I am not wrong to believe I am being watched with love.

The wind wants me to go toward the pier and I want to go toward the alley, and for two blocks we negotiate like cousins. The city at this hour is mostly cats and freight. A trolley mutters secrets to itself on the tracks. A pair of lovers use the hood of a car as if it is the only flat surface that can hold their conversation, and I look away because I know what Abuela would say about concrete and declarations. The gull with the nicked wing ghosts me from pole to pole, looking sated and smug, which is how gulls look when they have done something rude and were not punished. At Broadway he descends and walks with me like a dog who refuses a leash, heels like he learned posture in a previous life, and when I stop at a crosswalk because the light tells me to, he looks offended like I have embarrassed him in front of a friend.

When I get to the end of the pier, the boards are not doing their ghost-mouth trick, which is almost worse. The black of the water is honest in a way it forgets to be when there are crowds to entertain. A fisherman stands hunched over his bucket like he owes it rent. A boy throws a net badly and then better and I fall in love with him for six seconds and then remember I am not allowed to collect new boys for stories like baseball cards. The wind is stronger here and it is not a weather; it is a posture. It sets its shoulders and tells the flags to behave. It opens its palm and lets small trash perform their ballet. It smells like basil and motor and the inside of a clean cup fresh from a cupboard nobody opens enough.

“Portera,” it says in that square way, and I nod like we have met at a party and are pretending we are friends. The word sits comfortably on the inside of my lip, like a cut I keep touching with my tongue. It is not the kind of power you put on a business card. It is the kind you write inside your own name and underline twice and don’t tell the boy you are kissing because it will scare him in a way he will call romantic. I take the coin out and balance it on my middle finger like a second knuckle. The gull shifts his weight and mutters something obscene at me in bird, which is a dialect that sounds a lot like cigarettes in a church parking lot.

I’m expecting a door in the obvious places—under the boards, in the black water where the city keeps its bad temper, in the air where the salt makes shapes like saints. The door is not a hole tonight, and when I finally feel it, it is because the hairs on my wrists lean toward the street instead of the ocean, and the pier itself shifts its attention like a man in a pew whose phone lit up in his pocket. The door is in the lights. The streetlamps along the promenade are elbowing each other like men at a bar, and the hum they make has a seam down the middle that didn’t used to be there, a split, a hinge. I have never put my hand on a city light with anything but dislike—too white, too sure—but I do it now because the wind asks me to and because I am tired of letting the wrong things be in charge of my etiquette. The metal is warm and mostly indifferent. Then it isn’t. Then it pays attention like it has never been asked to before, like its job description always included answering me and nobody told it.

“Open?” I ask, and the word is not a magic word so much as an introduction to a conversation that is going to take the rest of my life. The light flickers, and for a second the edge where the globe meets the neck is more than hardware. I see a thin black line like the lid of an eye, and behind it, not light, not dark, but a small square of in-between that looks like the inside of my grandmother’s purse where the pennies have lived very long lives. The wind presses against my back like a person who has forgotten where I end and they begin, and I put my mouth close to the seam because I was not taught to be afraid of doors smaller than my hand.

The first thing that comes through is not a voice, but an absence, as if the light forgot to burn and instead remembered to listen. There is the paper scratch that accompanies bureaucracy when it is trying to seduce you into thinking you are being included, and there is a lemon rind bitterness at the back of my throat that tells me salt has been thinking about me. I say my name in that slow, two-handed way, the way you pass a heavy dish down a table, and the seam widens as much as a blink. It’s nothing and it’s enough. Behind it, I do not see anything that would make sense if I describe it. I see heat gathered into a fold. I see dust arranged like a choir. I see an index of laughter.

“Walk or sing,” I hear in the part of my head where my mother keeps her leftover advice, and it is an easier choice than I want it to be. I am tired enough to walk even if the floor is a question. I am smart enough to sing if the crowd asks me to. I put the coin against the seam and the metal does not spark and does not bite me and does not anything except admit the fact of my knuckle. The door opens the way a mouth opens when you decide to forgive someone because it is easier than hating them that day. I step my left foot in first because I am not an idiot and because my body is making decisions faster than my brain can get a hand up to interrupt.

Inside is a hall that is not a hall, and I know it because it has more corners than a geometry book and none of them behave. It smells like cheap paper and wanted things, the way zoning proposals smell when they are printed in back rooms by men who do not live in the neighborhood they are measuring. It smells like beeswax over those smells, which is somebody’s grandmother insisting the mess be pretty. There are drawers in the air, shallow ones, like the kind you keep flat things in and pretend are organized. There are lists that fidget when I pass them, like children who can’t help but kick the back of a chair. The wind cannot come this far and be itself, so it follows me as a polite chaperone, a hand to the small of my back that never touches me and will shout my name if I try to open something that isn’t mine.

I don’t know how long I am in the lamp, which is the sort of sentence only a person I do not want to be caught by would write, but the city keeps doing its shallow breathing outside and the boy with the net laughs and drops the weight of his net on his own shoe and says a word his mother would have pretended not to hear. The drawers open not when I pull them, but when I remember the thing they were meant to hide, which is maybe always how drawers work if you are honest. The first one is a sheaf of maps like the one that found us at the shop—long river, narrow river, nonexistent river, the line of the freeway like a signature pretending to be a spine. Someone circled places and then circled them again until the pen broke through the page in a perfect, ugly little hole. Someone wrote Not Yours in a tidy corner and then crossed it out, and I love them without reservation for their temporary bravery. The second drawer holds a stack of stamped receipts that all say “received” in the kind of ink that looks old immediately, which is a trick paper plays to make you forget it just learned how to walk.

There are permits, yes, not the ones we saw, not the show papers, but their mothers, drafts with the big words crooked and the numbers crossed out and the notes in the margins that say we can get away with it if we call it something else. There are memos named for innocence that talk about “emergency authorization,” and they smell like coffee and sunscreen and the inside of somebody’s Lexus. There are names. There are all the ways a city says yes to itself without asking its body. I make myself read without flinching for as long as I can stand it, which is not long, and then I fold the corner of one paper with the most audacity and tuck that corner under the corner of another and make them promise to argue about it while I sleep.

When I close the drawers they do not resist me. Nobody is trying to trap me here except my own predisposition to be precocious. I take out my black pen because I promised myself I would, and I write on the air where the list keeps trying to arrange itself, a fence I can fit a woman through. It’s not law. It’s the neighbor who sits on her porch and watches and whose mouth is so small you never expect the things she will say when she finally lifts her hand. If wind at east, howl at ten and not at three. If brine at mouth, place your tongue in your own cheek and wait. If bees in circle break, close the window, not the hive. If a gull with a nick looks at you, say, I see you, and do not lie. If a grandmother’s towel dries slow, do not ask for rain; ask why you forgot to wring it. Do not take permission from anyone who cannot say your name without your middle. Do not sign what you could sing. Do not sing what you could walk. Do not walk if a child is asleep on your shoulder.

I step out of the lamp because it is polite to leave before you are asked, and because the wind wants to say something to me and refuses to come inside. The gull is temporarily uninterested in me and is yelling at another gull about a french fry near a trash can that will tip like a drunk if anyone asks it to dance. The fisherman looks up and then looks down, and that could be my magic or it could be the beautiful arrogance of a man ignoring a miracle for his own sanity. The boy with the net swears again and does it better. A woman in a jacket with an old band’s name on the back leans her chin on the rail and gives the ocean the kind of dirty look you give a lover you refuse to stop going home to.

The wind laughs as much as something square can laugh. It puffs my hair up until I look violent. It presses its single word against my jaw. “Okay,” it says again, and this time the okay is not permission and not compliment; it is agreement, like two women at a bus stop who do not want to be having the same thought and are united by it anyway. It has a job for me and I know it, and it is not a job with a diagram and payment. It is a job as old as the part where people believed water was listening to them even when it was busy being itself.

In the morning, I pretend I am going to be reasonable. I put on the normal shirt for selling candles to people who do not want to talk about why they are buying them. I put the coin in the pocket that does not feel like a shrine. I make Jude coffee that tastes the way he likes—too sweet, almost vanilla, the color of a friendship bracelet—because he is coming by before opening to tell me the story of a woman who cried at Sea Dragon because frosting looks like snow and snow is not a California memory, and Jude is collecting other people’s weather the way some people collect shells. He arrives with a croissant that looks like it was rolled by a mean grandma and hugs me so hard my shoulder pops, and when I tell him I climbed into a streetlight, he closes his eyes like he is having the kind of fun that makes him late to work.

“You are going to get electrocuted by a metaphor,” he says, and then kisses my forehead like he is a mother I got from the thrift store. “We have a meeting this week,” he adds like it is the same sentence, that city council desk-of-doom thing where people who think they invented neighbors get to say a bunch of words at us and then ask us to be impressed by their ability to pronounce the names of streets that existed before their parents did.

I know about the meeting because the paper told me in the lamp in the way paper always tells you, with a schedule that pretends to have been agreed upon by everyone because nobody was invited to disagree. It is at six on Thursday because that is when it can be said that the city is welcoming and also when most people are wiping the day off their faces and not in the mood to kiss a microphone. The agenda is tart and orderly. “Adjustments to Outfall Procedure.” “Emergency Variance Reauthorization.” “Community Comment (Three-Minute Time Limit).” There is a little box next to “Community Comment” and in that box, in the lamp, I drew another box because it is what I had. The box is nothing and the box is a fence and the box is a song, and if I am not careful, I will believe my own trick.

Abuela is unimpressed when I tell her about the streetlight, which is to say she is secretly delighted and will not let me know because she wants me to be braver and not think bravery gets me out of sweeping. She straightens the towel over her shoulder and takes my face in her hand and makes me open my mouth like I might be hiding something under my tongue and speaking around it. “Say your name like a curse and like a prayer,” she instructs, which is not new, and then she adds, “Bring eggs to the meeting. They do not like to be seen by eggs.”

“You want me to throw them?” I ask, and she gives me the look she saves for the moments when I pretend not to know better.

“Bring them to sit next to your heart,” she says. “Paper has eyes for heat. If it sees a child, it will decide to behave. Sometimes. Bring a towel. Bring the black pen. Bring money for parking even though you can be rude about parking if you have to. Wear shoes you can kneel in. Wear no perfume because perfume is lying and this week we are not lying more than we have to.”

Mireya texts me the single most domestic photograph I have ever seen from her, a colander of lemons that looks like a sculpture of a woman’s mouth breathing, and writes, “Thursday. I will bring the patron saint of mold in a jar and keep him in my bag unless the air starts to behave like a tongue that needs reminding. Wear your wrist bones out. Those help.” She adds a photo of her ankles in socks with goats on them, which I am not sure is a threat or a blessing. I send her a picture of my black pen and my worst hat and my coin in my palm, the lines of the copper faking constellations, and she sends back a voice message that is only a laugh and it sits under my ribs like a found penny.

The shop is busy the next two days in the way that happens when people can smell something they can’t name and think they can hide it by buying something that smokes. A woman from National City tells me she woke up with salt on her windowsill and that she knows how ridiculous that sounds, and I tell her it sounds like a letter address and she cries for exactly the amount of time it takes for me to find the good rosemary, not the polite kind. A man buys another baby-shaped candle and does not make eye contact because he has started to suspect the baby is not changing his neighbor’s drumming and that he might have to be the person who asks. Teenagers make nests of their own knees in the corner and talk about teachers as if teachers are mythical beasts, and I sell them a bundle of basil like I am the aunt who gives them a bus pass in secret.

At night, the salt square does not write. It sits like a small elegant person who refuses to perform for company. The ring on the counter fades and then returns, and the pattern changes just enough that if I stare at it long enough I can convince myself I am learning a new language. The note under the pepper has a new line in the small script: “If you must be late, bring a chair for the person who isn’t.” The coin goes hot-cold hot-cold in my pocket in a pattern that, if I were a worse person, I would say feels like an instrument tuning itself. The gull with the nick or his cousin or his wife stares at me from the lamppost every time I look up, and one afternoon when I am making change with my hands like a magician, he throws a peanut shell at the window like he wants me to know I could never survive in his family.

The day of the meeting, the light is the kind that makes people’s teeth look better than their intentions. The marine layer gave up at eleven and roared off like a bored aunt, and the sky has the angry clarity that makes tourists fight with each other about whether they packed the right shoes. I dress like a polite person. I dress like the kind of woman men thank from the dais. I dress like I am about to tell the truth and apologize afterward for not being a different shape. I put two hard-boiled eggs in my bag next to the black pen and the mirror and the towel, and I tell Jude if he eats them because he thinks it’s funny I will bite him on the wristbone where it will bruise scenic. He wears the bruise-colored thrift-store shirt and looks like a civil servant lost in a poem. He wears cologne because he is a liar and I tell him to knock it off at the door, and he rubs his wrists on a rosemary bush and complains about being made into a salad, and a woman passing by says, “That is not an insult,” without breaking stride and I wish I had wrote that down.

City Hall wears its history in stale air and marble like gilt on a saint, and I love it in the way you love the house where you had your childhood fevers. There is the big room where they do the important pretending, with its speakers and its high walls and its parking-lot chairs dressed up like church, and then there is the anteroom where paper flirts with paper on bulletin boards and notices curl at the corners from the humidity of mouths. We put our names on the slip for public comment. The clipboard weighs more than it should. There is the three-minute timer like a joke in bad taste. There are men in shirts that fit their stories and women in shoes that make them respectable, and there are a few of us dressed like we do the work of holding the world down while it kicks.

Kristin is there in a suit that makes me want to put her feet in a bowl of hot water and peel a clementine for her while I scold her for doing a job she’s too good at. The Compliance Director is there with a stack of paper that could be biblically unkind or extremely boring depending on who reads it. There is a man from a consulting firm whose jawline suggests he has never sweated in public, and he says “dispersion” like a dessert. There are a few grandmothers lined up like saints outside a bad bar. There are three kids who brought their skateboards and changed their minds inside and now hold their boards with embarrassment and devotion because they wanted the boards to see this too, in the way you bring your child to something that will hurt and help. Nobody has salt because the signs at the door reversed themselves for us and said “No Weapons,” and we obeyed because weapons are a word paper uses when it wants to remind you it can be scared.

We are late in the good way because our names go on the second page of the public comment sheet in the spots that don’t make people sigh when they sit there waiting to sing their three minutes into a clock. We are on time in the way my mother taught me to be, warm and unrushed and with our wrists clean. Abuela sits at the end of our row and does not clap for anyone because she doesn’t clap in rooms with microphones. She holds one of the eggs in her palm like it is a rosary she is considering converting to. Mireya sits with her knees neatly together like a woman in an old photograph and smells like caves and Tuesday, and when a man in a suit turns around and gets her scent on him, he looks confused and charmed like he almost remembers the shape of the first place he was ever brave.

It goes how it always goes and how it never goes. The people who start say the numbers and the way the pipe acts like a necklace when it is miles out and all the shapes it makes that are good shapes, and the diagrams have arrows that do the polite thing of curving away from the places with children and into the broad beloved nothing of ocean. The east wind is an anomaly. The reverse wind is a quirk. The brine is returned. The plant is a mother who is too tired to breastfeed all the time and must be forgiven for using a bottle sometimes because the baby will not notice if we are very good at pretending. A man says, “We are a thirsty city,” and a woman says, “We are an innovative city,” and another man says, “We are in compliance,” and then someone remembers to say, “We understand your concern,” because they have learned to say it in training and it has paid the rent on their car.

Then it is the turn of the people who smell like rosemary and bus stops. A woman from a fishing family stands and tells the story about the day she went out too far and the water changed color in a way it doesn’t do when what is in it is just itself moving around. She says, “It tasted wrong on my teeth,” and a man in the second row flinches because he is so tired of not being allowed to use the good words. A teacher speaks for exactly three minutes with the exact quiet obscene intensity of a person who has counted children through a fire drill. A boy holds his skateboard like a shield and says, “I can’t skate under the bridge when it stinks like a battery,” and looks at the floor like he might vomit because his voice did the thing voices do when you are proud and hate it.

When it is our row, Jude stands first because he is the person who makes the jokes so the rest of us can be strict. He introduces himself with a title he invented and a bright smile like he is attacking the room with kindness, and he tells the room about bees not being drunk when they are confused, and the way a circle breaks when the air loses its manners, and how you can mist sugar to keep panic from being contagious. He says “dispersion” like a woman who is tired, and two men on the dais smile without meaning to, and it breaks their faces into people for half a second. He says thank you and then rolls the thank you on his tongue like he’s tasting whether it deserves to be swallowed, and the buzzer doesn’t get to him because he sits down before it remembers to try.

Mireya stands and the room adjusts its bra like it has a crush it doesn’t want to call by name. She does not say her last name. She says, “I’m here,” and everybody hears the other parts of the sentence. She says, “Wind moves like a woman who left and came back to get her earrings,” and the stenographer laughs and then looks at her fingers like they misbehaved. She says, “Salt is a worker and you cannot pay it with compliments,” and she says, “I make rot on purpose and I know the good kind when I smell it in a room,” and she says, “What you return is larger than your modeling will let you admit because you have taught your paper to believe a diagram more than it believes a child who says his boards won’t roll.” She does not raise her voice. She speaks like a deadline. She doesn’t run out of time because when the little red light flicks, a bee appears out of the heating duct and lands on it and sits there until it turns green again, and yes, it is a coincidence, and yes, it’s a miracle, and yes, it’s a trick, and yes, it’s the only reason the men on the dais get to hear the last sentence, which is, “Do not ask us to drink your variance and call it rain.”

I stand because it’s time and because the eggs in my bag have reached the exact temperature where they are the same as my body. I say my name the way I promised. I say I live on the block where the mural above the shop looks at you and has opinions. I say I have a grandmother who can hear a lie through the sink. I say I have put my ear to the tunnel. I say I have put my tongue on the wind. I say I have put my pen on paper that does not belong to me, but belongs to all of us who have to sleep with the windows open because we cannot afford air conditioning and so we inhale whatever experiment you think you can hide in a long paragraph. I say if you must make a bed under my house for the pipe to sleep in, move it on Thursdays when the wind is wrong. I say if your paper cannot write the word east in a sentence that ends with stop, then I will write it and tape it to your door. I say, “Do not be late to your own decency,” and the buzzer sounds and I have to stop, which is maybe the only time today a rule felt useful.

There are questions, and the questions are not bad questions if you devour them with the right sauce. There is a man who asks me if I am a scientist and I do not spit, and I say I am a person who knows a taste is a kind of data and you can put it on a graph if you are brave, and the woman next to him looks at her hands like she wants to take off her ring because it suddenly weighs more. There is a man who says “perception” and I say “perception is a cousin of reality that sleeps on your couch and eats from your fridge and you have to love him because he lives there,” and the man does not write that down because he does not want to admit it made his mouth want to smile. There is a question addressed to Mireya about “sources,” and she tells the room she gets her milk from goats and her rot from the part of the air that has been hurt and still remembers how to cook. There is a question for Jude about his wrists and he gets to be funny and coy, and the room breathes, because we have to give it that, these small releases, or it will tremble itself apart.

When the men in the chairs say “we will take your comments under advisement,” the paper in the big black binder that lives in my bag now even if it never leaves the room quivers like a small dog in a storm. The man with the keys is there at the edge of the dais because he is everywhere paper is afraid, and he looks at me and nods in that way again, that mosquito truce. When they vote to continue the variance, because of course, because the story goes the way it goes until we ruin it, I feel something that is not surprise and not despair and is the quiet tightening a woman’s mouth does when she decides she is going to be a problem for a long time but will continue to bring a towel.

Outside on the steps, the wind does not bother to be square. It comes from the east and from the south and from the memory of somebody’s mouth and it tastes like a lemon squeezed over the first soup of the day. The bees that followed Mireya are brief and disciplined and then gone, like theater. The gull with the nicked wing is eating a French fry out of a boy’s hand because the boy is at the age where to be stolen from by a bird is the thing that makes the day feel holy. Abuela puts her palm on my forehead like a doctor and tells me my temperature is a prayer and that I need to eat if I am going to pretend to be wise again after seven.

Mireya does not hug me because we have agreed not to make confessions on concrete, but she stands close enough that our shoulders might as well, and she says, “It was always going to be Thursday. The bed will not move until someone falls out of it.” She looks at the old smokestack far off like it owes her money. “There will be a night when they have to shut the pipe because they will be afraid of something that looks bad on paper and not because of anything real. That is your window. We will go then.”

“What will we do?” I ask, because I am ridiculous like that, still wanting to see a to-do list taped to a saint’s chest.

She looks at me like I am a drawer she knows better than to open in public. “We will bring lemons,” she says. “We will bring a towel. We will bring the coin and your grandmother’s love and Jude’s wrists and the name you picked, and we will teach the outfall to say please.”

That night, the salt square sings in a key I haven’t learned, and I lie on the kitchen floor with my head under the cabinet like a person hiding from weather and I learn how to hum it until my mouth gives up trying to be beautiful. The ring on the counter grows a peninsula. The note under the pepper adds, in the smallest, sharpest hand yet, “When they close, walk.” The coin is so warm in my palm it feels like it has been under a tongue. I sleep with it under my pillow like a child and a queen and a thief, and when I dream, the pier is shorter than it has ever been, and the ocean is so close I could push her with my foot, and the wind lays its weight on my back like a mother who finally sat down.

Morning says it was kidding about being kind. The forecast is a joke. The east wind comes with her hands full of small lies and somebody’s hair. The city smells like bread and batteries, basil and bleach, a parade of things you were not supposed to put next to each other on the stove. The gulls act like executives who can see the emails we can’t. The first text comes from Kristin at an hour too precise to be accidental: “Outfall maintenance tonight. 1 a.m. Temporary shut down. Modeling requires test.” The second text is from Jude: “I stole a flashlight from the back room at Sea Dragon and I think it is haunted by a guy named Ron.” The third is from Mireya: it is not words, just a photo of her hands with lemon rind under the nails and a streak of blue ink across her thumb that matches the color of the sky when it knows it’s been lying.

Abuela watches me put the towel in the bag and the eggs back in the fridge and the mirror in the scarf and the black pen into the pocket over my heart. She puts a lemon in my mouth and says “walk,” and then she kisses the top of my head and says “sing,” and I nod like a parrot and like a priest. When I step into the hallway, the wind says my name like it’s bringing me a bill and then says okay again, and I say it back, because I am that kind of fool, and because I have learned that sometimes the only way out of a door is to be rude to it with grace.
