The first light walked down the sides of the glass tower like a lazy gold cat, stretching, licking the smudges I’d missed the night before. I pressed the mop again into the bucket and watched the water go gray. District 1 was waking: horns, the smell of bánh mì toasting, the elevator somewhere chiming repeatedly as if it too was hungry. My name is My, pronounced like “mee,” which nobody in this building remembered. They liked to say Miss Mai or Miss Me. I didn’t mind. A cleaner doesn’t ask for remembering.

I worked the graveyard shift on the twenty-sixth floor. When the offices emptied, we came in with our caddies and soft shoes. There were three of us on the floor usually: me, Lan Chi, and a boy who was still in high school who used his headphones for armor. I liked the peace. My old radio clipped to my apron pocket, volume low, a soft drizzle of cải lương plays and Sunday recipes. The morning anchor’s voice, thick as condensed milk: “And now, dear listeners, if your chiffon cake collapses... don’t panic.”

That always made me smile. Don’t panic, indeed.

Down in the lobby, the security guard, Anh Minh, would tip his helmet every time I passed. “Em My, still awake?”

“Still awake,” I’d answer, and sometimes he’d hand me a mango that his wife had wrapped in newspaper, so fragrant I could almost taste it through the peel. I’d put it in my tote beside my cleaning gloves and feel its weight, like a small sun to take home.

Home was a room at the back of a hem, a narrow alley that split in half like a fishbone in District 3, where the laundry lines crisscrossed and the motorbikes slept like dogs. Our door was the color of old jade, chipped at the latch. When I opened it, Auntie would be up already, sitting on her cot, plucking a plastic bag of herbs, her hair pinned in two stubborn rolls on the side of her head. People called her Dì Lan, which meant Auntie Orchid, but later we learned her memory was not the kind that held blossoms but the kind like a sieve, and I had to be the water that kept coming through. That morning, I put the mango in her hands.

“Who gave you this?” she asked.

“A guard at the tower,” I said, kicking off my shoes and rolling my stockings down. “His wife had extras. It smells like the neighbors’ altar.”

She sniffed it and said, “We should cut it for breakfast. With salt and chili. I’ll steam the sticky rice. Are we rich today?”

“I brought tips from the law firm on twenty-six. They forget to empty their brown envelopes, sometimes. Rich enough for a pineapple if you want.”

“Pineapple tears my tongue,” she said, shaking her head. “Let’s not anger the ancestors so early.”

We made breakfast in the tiny kitchen: a single burner, a sink that coughed when the water first ran. I scrubbed the pot with the brown dish sponge. Across the window, the neighbor poured his basin out with a whoosh onto the drain ditch, and the smell of fish sauce rode in on the air. I’d stop being a cleaning woman there on the tile floor and become what I loved being even more: a baker.

It makes no sense, does it. A room that fits a bed and a table too small for elbows, a woman with hair pins and fingers softening like bananas, a girl who brings home tips in crumpled bills. And yet, there I was, sifting flour over the plastic bowl we kept in the bottom cupboard, the one with a crack I’d taped from the outside, weighing out coconut milk in a chipped cup. The oven made more noise than our neighbor’s karaoke machine and sometimes a clutch then a breath of silence that made my chest tighten until it rumbled back to life, but it was ours. Second-hand from a consignment shop run by a cousin of a friend of a friend, a lineage of small miracles.

The first cake I learned by heart was pandan chiffon. The green of the leaves, pounded with a mortar until my arm went numb, strained into a milky softness that always reminded me of shallow river water. The smell was memory. Auntie would close her eyes when it was in the oven, arms folded like a queen on a boat, and tell me about the war like recipes: where to run, whom to trust, how to barter for sweets with coins you sewed into your hem. She had made bánh da lợn on the days when money was too thin to stretch over a market fish, layering tapioca batter with mung bean, green and yellow, green and yellow, like rice fields seen from a plane I’d never board.

“Don’t slam the door,” she said, as if I’d forgotten the physics of cake collapse. “And don’t open until the top is golden brown at the edge. There, see? Like that. But not yet.”

I watched it through the warped glass. Cakes have faces, if you spend enough time with them. This one was rising like a lung, lifting at the corners, pulling itself together.

“You cut straight lines,” she said, and her voice became a thread into my childhood. “Never make triangular pieces for the temple. Triangles are sharp; they cut luck. Squares, rectangles, all corners safe.”

“I remember,” I said, and that was true and not. I remembered how she had, once upon a time, sold sticky rice near Bến Thành Market, balancing two baskets on a pole across her shoulder, her hands so deft that she could make change with her toes. I remembered being small and falling asleep under the table at the back, the click of her coins soothing as rain. But the edges blurred, like our cracked bowl.

After breakfast I slept, a few hours pressed between heat and the fan’s squeaks. But before my eyes closed I took out the old phone and scrolled through a page of the show Lien had made me look at, a glittering thing called Sugar City. The latest headline had a picture of a woman lifting a macaron in slow motion, powder sugar drifting fairy-like. I had laughed. “Where is the sweat in this? Where is the auntie cutting brown sugar with a cleaver? Where is the auntie who whispers to her coconut shredder?”

“You’re the auntie now,” Lien had said, smirking under her market awning. “You just don’t know it yet. Apply. You don’t win; at least you have video to show your children when they’re old. If not, you post to your neighborhood. For once, people can like something you do that isn’t cleaning their desks.”

I had filled out the form at the net cafe after my shift. Color of eyes, brown. Color of heart, don’t know. Specialty: “Cakes that listen.” Tuan, who patched the seat of my motorbike with duct tape and good wishes, took a photo of me with a cake. I wore my good blouse. I did not expect any answer. People like me do not put on the big TV except in the background while apartments are vacuumed.

I woke to the smell of guava from someone’s house and the sound of Auntie arguing with the gas burner. On the wall the clock said three, but daytime three or night three meant different animals, and I had to blink to decide which. It was hot, still, in a way the fan could only apologize for. I threw my hair into a bun, splashed water on my face, and went out to the alley where children were sitting with plastic bowls of shaved ice topped with cocoa and condensed milk, their tongues loud, red, green.

At the market, Lien was fanning herself and her wobbly mound of jackfruit seeds. “I’m melting,” she said, “and my jackfruit is melting too. Buy it now or it will leave me without a goodbye.”

“Give me a handful,” I said. “Auntie wants to make chè later.”

“She wants? When does she not want?” Lien laughed and lowered her voice. “She is good today?” Lien always asked me in that tone, the tone of people recognizing a kind of weather beyond our umbrellas.

“She is talking to the radio,” I said, handing over coins. “She thinks the singer is Minh Ngọc from 1977.”

“Better the singer than a ghost,” Lien said, and then she snapped open her phone with the speed of a girl and not the age she carried. “Did you see? They opened the shortlist on Sugar City. I told you. Look.”

I made a face. “No one wants to see me crush pandan and pour it into a noisy oven.”

But she thrust the phone at me anyway, thumb tapping a video that bloomed with music. It was a montage; hands kneading dough, voices full of twinkle. The host, a man who had built his career on a charismatic chin, stood in front of a lit-up set and shouted, “Finalists! We’ll see you in two weeks!”

“They show the faces?” I asked, breath back. The phone would only load one frame, freeze, then judder to another. Saigon internet is like rain at times: a gush, then nothing.

“Scroll,” Lien said.

“Later,” I said, handing it back. “If it is meant, it is meant. If not, we will make chè with extra jackfruit and tell the neighbors we’re celebrating Wednesday.”

“Stubborn girl,” she muttered, but there was affection under the muttering. We had known each other since we were eight and got in trouble for sliding down the temple steps and tearing our knees on the moss.

Tuan’s garage was a slot of shadow split by a rivulet of light and oil. He was bent over a Yamaha with a cigarette behind his ear. The radio above him was announcing a promotion: Buy a set of knives, get a measuring cup free. I tapped the horn of my Honda and watched him raise his head.

“The queen arrives!” he sang. “I have been waiting all morning for your royal decree.”

“My brakes squeal like pigs,” I said.

He swung the bike onto the stand, clucked his tongue at it like it was a naughty child. “Everything in this city squeals. You included.” Then softer: “You applied?”

“I applied,” I said, and he nodded without teasing, which meant more than if he'd given a speech.

“If they pick you,” he said, “we’ll put your face on the garage. People will bring their motorbikes not for me but to say they saw you once. I will charge for photographs.”

“If they pick me,” I said, “I will make you a cake shaped like a wrench. It will taste like condensed milk, not metal.”

“As you say,” he grinned, then ducked his head under the handlebar.

Afternoons I cooked; evenings I cleaned. The city changed under the light as if it were a living thing—well, it was—a creature that rolled over and showed a different belly. On the bus to the tower, a boy with hair dyed the color of seaweed slept with his mouth open. A woman in a pink hoodie sang to her infant, off-key but startlingly beautiful. I practiced, in the air only, folding egg whites. A movement in the wrist, a scoop upward, a cut across, patience like a religion. Under my breath, I recited ingredients: “Cake flour 120 grams. Caster sugar, 120. Eggs, six. Cream of tartar—if none, a squeeze of lemon.”

When I reached the tower, the lobby smelled of lilies and carpet cleaner. The elevator’s blue numbers climbed. The twenty-sixth floor was cold as a fish, and the lights buzzed over the desks, where the executives had left behind coffee rings and, sometimes, emails on their screens like undressed bodies. I made spaces tidy. I made the corners sharp enough to hold luck. I put the mugs in the dishwasher, set the button, listened to the water thrash quietly, felt something like pride. Clean is a kind of dessert you serve the world, I told myself one night, leaning on the window and watching the city flicker: clean is not nothing.

Around midnight, the phone vibrated in my pocket. I pulled it out to see a number without a name. Usually, I don’t answer those. They mean debt collectors or impolite sales persons who call me sister then hang up. This time, I did.

“Hello?”

Static. A female voice. “Is this… Ms. My? Mai? My?”

“This is My,” I said, glancing at the sink as it filled with soapy clouds. “Who is calling?”

“This is Thảo,” the voice chomped a little on her consonants. She was trying to sound calm and professional. “From the Network. Sugar City. We received your… your application, and the video.”

“Video?” I whispered, and then remembered Tuan had made a shaky video of me flipping a cake onto a rack, the sound half traffic, half oven. He had kept the radio on, and some influencer was nattering about how to get your dog to do yoga. “Yes. That video.”

“So,” she said, and I heard papers shuffle, the language of officialdom. “We are pleased to inform you—are you in a place to talk?”

I leaned on the sink. I couldn’t help it; I looked at the window again. There was my reflection, a face with the mop parked behind my shoulder like a flag. “I can talk.”

“We had a dropout today,” she said, with a sigh that told me this was not supposed to be how good news arrives. “Our finalist from Da Lat broke her wrist. We are sorry for her, of course. But we have a space now, and your—your pandan, it made people in the office hungry. So if you can attend the final, we would be… delighted.”

The word echoed, delighted, as if it were a drum. I had to put my hand over my mouth to trap something that was trying to fly out. “Final,” I repeated, because the brain does not trust things that jump so quickly from dream to mouth.

“Yes,” she said, with a little laugh like she had pressed a button that makes callers cry. “It is in two weeks. Filming starts on a Monday. There will be three days of orientation, two days of filming the content, the studio—you are in Ho Chi Minh City, yes?”

“District 3,” I said, and then added without knowing why, “Near the fruit shop with the red awning.”

“We can send a car,” she said. “If it is easier. Do you accept?”

It seemed unbelievable that she would need to ask twice, that the world had changed under my feet while I was counting coffee spoons. I looked at my hands. They were cracked at the knuckles from soap and lemon. “Yes,” I said, quietly at first. “Yes.”

She exhaled. “We will send a packet to your email. There will be legal items and a wardrobe list—please bring your own aprons if you have them. The host likes—hmm—texture.”

“I have one with flowers,” I said, thinking of the cotton apron Auntie had stitched in 1998, when we still had a red Singer, when I was small enough to hide under the table. The flowers had faded like stickers that had decided to become ghostly. “I will bring it.”

“And your aunt?” Thảo asked suddenly, as if she had practiced this question. “In your application, you spoke of your aunt. Sometimes we bring family to film a short segment at home. It makes the audience feel—connected.”

“My aunt,” I said, and the word felt both warm and risky. “She would like that.” And I could feel the way Auntie’s hands folded, the way she would sit up straight and tell the camera that I was stubborn and that stubbornness, when cooked correctly, is simply a cake that refuses to fall.

“Wonderful,” said Thảo. “We will be in touch tomorrow with details. Congratulations, Ms. My.”

She said my name correctly the second time. After I ended the call, I looked at the mop, and I wanted to hug it. I wiped my hands on the rag and then laughed, absurdly, because I was wiping my excitement away like stain and knew that there was no point: it had already soaked in.

The dishwasher finished with a little musical trill. I passed Mr. Pham’s desk and straightened his stapler, which he always left crooked, not knowing that on nights like these people were being chosen and lifted like hotcakes from their pans. When I pressed the elevator button, it glowed, and my heart hammered so hard I thought I could clean the whole floor with the energy from inside my ribs.

At home, Auntie was awake. The radio was still on and the announcer was going slow over a poem about boats. The mango pit was on the plate, chewed clean, glistening like bone. Auntie looked up, frowning, my face probably too bright, too different.

“What happened?” she asked. “You look like someone just proposed.”

I put the tote down and went to her, kneeling at the side of the cot, like when I had smashed my knee on the temple step and she had picked gravel from it with a pin. “I got into a… a show,” I said. “A baking show. On television. They have a vacancy and they want me.”

She blinked, and her shoulders rose in a little jerk that could have been excitement or simply the ache of getting older. “They want you? Because you are good,” she said, as if stating something as ordinary as the price of eggs.

“They want me,” I said again, and it tasted strange, good, dangerous. “They will film me. They will film here. You will be in it. You will sit tall and tell them that you taught me to beat eggs by hand.”

“I taught you to beat life by hand,” she sniffed, and then she laughed at herself and pressed a hand on mine. “We need to buy coconut. And pandan. And good eggs. The ones with orange centers like sunrise. And I’ll make tea. And—wait—on television? Will I need to and… fix my hair? My hair is a poem today.”

She was brighter suddenly, lit from inside in that old way. We talked logistics like generals. I wrote on a scrap of paper: sugar, coconut milk, mung bean, pandan leaves, eggs, rice flour. The list looked like a song, a chant to ward off fear. Auntie pressed her thumb on the paper and left a whorl, like an official stamp.

When I finally lay down, my mind was not mine. It walked ahead of me, down corridors I hadn’t entered. I imagined the studio, the host’s big smile, the cooling racks like hundreds of silver cities, the cameras with eyes that didn’t blink. I imagined standing in my shoes which I’d polished with the same cloth I used for our altar, my apron with its tired flowers, and my hands steady as bridges. I imagined them asking me to speak, to say where I came from, and I would open my mouth and out would come the hem, the narrowness, the mop, the dish sponge, the mango, the sticky rice browned at the edges, the neighbor’s radio spitting static, the way Auntie’s fingers trembled when she threaded a needle now, but still threaded.

In the morning, we went to the market early, when the vegetables yawned and the air was kind. Auntie wore her blue blouse with the pearl buttons that weren’t pearls. She insisted on carrying the basket, fending me off with her elbow. We stopped at the herb woman who sold pandan tied in wet bundles. “My niece will be on television,” Auntie informed her in the voice that she used to tell cats to go away.

“Will she,” the woman said, tearing wilted edges off the leaves with two practiced flicks. “Then she will need extra pandan. They will smell you before they even turn the cameras on.”

“Good,” I said. “We will drown the gossip in coconut.”

By the fish stall, Auntie hesitated, eyes gone far in the old way, the cord that tied her firmly to the ground loosening a little. She turned to me and asked, as she sometimes did, “Is your name… My?”

“It is,” I said, softly, setting my hand on her back, the bone there sharp, a ship’s keel. “It is.”

“Hm,” she said, frowning at a tub of eels like thin snakes. “Good name.”

We returned home with the basket full like a heart. I set Auntie to wash the pandan and told her not to look away, that the leaves would run away if she didn’t keep eyes on them. She laughed and said, “My leaves are loyal.” I whipped a batter for a test cake like a promise. The smell filled the room, moved into the hall, and I heard someone outside say, “What is that? Smells like a memory.”

I called Tuan first. He answered and shouted through the garage noise. “My queen!”

“They chose me.”

He swore, in that beautiful inventive way of mechanics. Then he said, “I knew it,” and then he said, “Lien is going to scream, wait until I—Lien!” and then the line went a tangle of overlapping voices, laughter, his radio blaring a song about cinnamon. He came over on his break with two cans of iced coffee and demanded to know what he should wear to stand at the edge of a frame and nod like a friend. “Anything without holes,” I said, and he regarded his shirt dubiously.

Lien arrived at noon with her hair in a scarf like a mango peel and a basket of pomelos. “To keep your luck round,” she declared. “If you fail, at least you smell nice.” Then she hugged me hard and whispered in my ear, “Don’t forget to look at the camera like it is someone you love.”

“Who do I love?” I asked, because teasing felt safer than admitting I was already making a body out of fear and putting it in a chair across from me.

She looked at Auntie, who was arranging the pandan leaves on a tray like noodles. “Start with that one,” she said.

I sent emails—polite, careful—tapped back to Sugar City’s staff that I accepted, that I would be ready. Their reply arrived with forms and a list of what to bring, what not to say. Don’t mention other networks. Don’t wear logos. Don’t look directly into the host’s eyes when he is off-script (this instruction made me laugh so hard I had to sit). Do not reveal winners before the broadcast. Do smile often. Do not cry in a way that makes the sponsor’s product seem inappropriate. There was so much to remember that my brain wanted to lie down.

In the evening, after dinner of fish and herbs smashed into rice, a neighbor knocked. She was new, a woman with hair the color of coal and an accent from the north. She held a plate with banana fritters that shone like planets. “For you,” she said. “We heard you are going to be… famous.”

I took the plate careful as a newborn. “Come eat with us,” I said, and of course she refused, and of course she came in anyway and sat on the stool with the leg that might break without warning. She told us about her three children, her husband who was a barber with a laugh like a broom, her mother in Ha Nam who carved wood without patterns. “When you are on the TV, wave,” she said. “I will wave back at my house even if you can’t see me.”

I imagined a city of people waving, and my throat did a small, weird thing. It is embarrassing to admit, but I was so full that night I didn’t feel the hunger I usually keep like a companion. I read the recipe again for a sponge with durian cream, thought about its trust in me, closed my eyes and pictured the order of operations: separate eggs, whip whites, fold, bake, cool, cut, whip cream to soft, not stiff peaks, fold in pureed durian their cameraman would call exotic and I would call simply fruit.

Auntie went to bed humming. I sat on the step outside with the bowl I had used to wash pandan stems. The water turned faintly green where the leaves had kissed it. The hem was alive: a boy raced a paper boat down the ditch; a grandpa sprinkled water on the feet of his pot plants like a priest; the woman upstairs called to her cat with the passion of an opera singer. Motorbikes chuckled and coughed. Somewhere a guitar tested its tune. I sat and let the city move around me like water around a stone.

The next day, I took the morning shift off. I told Ms. Thu, my boss, that I had to attend to family, and she looked at me over her glasses like an owl who had learned to be weary. She was a dignified woman with wrists thin as chalk sticks and a braid that reached her waist as if it secretly made a living as a snake. “Family,” she repeated. “I do not like family. Family makes us late.” But then she softened, surprising herself. “But bring me a slice when you are famous. I will tell people I am your manager.”

“I will bring you the end piece,” I said. “The piece with more brown.”

“Good girl,” she said, and waved her hand like a queen blessing me for the camera.

We practiced walking in the house as if we were on camera. Lien made me stand at the sink and stir rice flour slurry while she interviewed me in a pretend voice. “My, tell us what you love most about cake.”

“That it forgives,” I said, without meaning to. “That sometimes you think you have ruined it—too much folding, too little, oven too hot, the sugar grainy—and then you wait, and it settles, and you take a breath and it is okay. Better, even.”

“Good answer,” she said, eyes glinting. “Now, tell us when you first knew you could bake.”

“When Auntie spat out my first pancake and said, ‘Do not feed this to enemies, it is too cruel.’ And then showed me how.” I turned to Auntie. “True?”

“True,” she said, not looking up. “And I do not retract the spit.”

We laughed. The room got bright. I forgot for a whole hour that money is not a wave but a tide, that it goes out as often as in. I forgot that the future has sharp corners.

That night, too late for decent visits, a young man came to the door from the Network with a release form for Auntie to sign. He had two cameras slung across him; he smiled in the way of those who photograph children and dogs. We sat him down, poured tea, cleared a corner of our small table. He took photos of the kitchen as if it were a museum exhibit. “It is good,” he said, “nice light.” The compliment felt so strange I wanted to give it back. He asked Auntie to sign; she took the pen, held it like chopsticks, paused. The recognition of what signatures mean came and went across her face like a small cloud. I put my hand over hers and guided her fingers and told the man she was shy. He nodded, not unkind. Then he took a photo of me in front of the oven, which chose that moment to go quiet as a thinking cat. “Turn it on,” he said. I reached for the dial. It shuddered to life, and he smiled, and the flash was like a lightning that promised no rain.

On the third day, we visited the studio. The security guard called up, someone in a headset said “send her,” we stepped into a hall that smelled of paint and new glue. I had never been somewhere like that. The sets were bright as candy. There were four ovens lined like soldiers. Everything gleamed like the inside of a mouth. The host was not there, the charisma had not yet been plugged in, but a woman with a clipboard came toward us with a stride that meant business. “My,” she said. “Welcome. We’ll do fittings. Your section is filming at home Friday. The final is next week. We like your story. It’s—” she paused and almost said something like “relatable” but did not quite. “Good,” she concluded. “Will your aunt be there? People will love her.”

“She will be there,” I said, and watched Auntie touch the counter’s cold edge, the light running over her fingers.

When we left, the sun was a slice over the tin roofs, and I had a paper bag full of loaner aprons and a packet of schedules that made my head ring. Tuan met us at the street with his motorbike already idling. He had cleaned it. It looked like a boy who was going to see his girl. He hoisted Auntie up behind me and promised to drive slow. We went home through the sweating traffic, the city opening its mouth to catch rain that didn’t, in the end, fall. My head thrummed with lists, with the taste of fat durian on the tongue of the idea of a future where I was something other than a mosquito in the background of other people’s offices.

We turned into the hem. The kids were chalking dragons on the concrete, already half erased by feet. Somebody’s television was blaring a karaoke ballad about unrequited love at a speed too fast to be anything other than merciful. I turned around on the bike seat to say something to Auntie about buying an extra bundle of pandan tomorrow—pandan has a way of going limp when neglected—and she had her eyes closed, face tilted to the wind as if to drink it. In that moment, seeing her, I felt a knot of something old and ungovernable unravel in my chest. I am not a person who cries easily. I breathed and held the straps of the paper bag tight and promised, silently, to the ovens, to the mango, to the city—do not let me waste this.

At home, we made chè with jackfruit and ate it on the step with plastic spoons. The sky was a cotton sheet, softened by years of washing. Lien came by with her famous gossip and her yellow laughter. Tuan pretended to critique my sugar work and then had a second bowl. The neighbor’s new baby hiccuped like a tiny motor. In this place, on a step barely as wide as my shoulders, I felt my new life and my old life press together like layers in bánh da lợn, no seam between green and yellow if you looked at it from far enough away.

When the bowl was empty, I set the spoon aside and leaned my head against the doorframe. Somebody, somewhere in the hem, had turned on a radio to a cooking show, and the host was saying, “Don’t panic,” as if she could see me.

“I won’t panic,” I said to no one and everyone. “I will bake. I will clean. I will… I will remember.”Two weeks is both a lifetime and a puddle you can step over. Day one I am a cleaner with an apron stiff from lemon and soap, and day fourteen I am a person who has to decide whether my apron with flowers is too shy for television. The mornings that week smell like plan and panic. I write lists until the lists are almost scripture. Coconut milk, check. Pandan, check. Eggs with yolks the color of monks’ robes, check. Dì Lan sits at the table and pretends to scold me for my bad handwriting and then squeezes my fingers when I take the pen because she has started forgetting where pens go after they leave her hand. We hang the apron on the back of the chair and look at it the way some people look at wedding dresses. It has frayed edges and a small brown spot that refuses to lift, a memory of caramel from last Tết when I burned the sugar on purpose because Auntie said bitter makes the sweet look rich.

On Thursday, a woman named Phuong with a high ponytail and shoes that click like chopsticks comes to scout the apartment. She moves through our room with her clipboard like a tide measuring depth. She says, “We’ll put the camera here, and here, lights here,” and then frowns at the ceiling fan because it will chop their light into confetti. She asks if we can remove the framed photograph of my parents on the altar because the sponsor prefers neutral backgrounds. “We can blur it,” I say, standing in front of the altar without meaning to. She hears the tone in my voice, the one I have when someone reaches for Auntie’s elbow in the market with too much authority, and she says, “Okay, we blur.”

The hem learns faster than the internet. By afternoon people have started to ask if they need to wear nice shirts to stand in the background. The noodle woman offers to sweep the alley twice. The boys promise to keep their football to the far end. The grandfather upstairs says he will play the guitar softly, as if the sound can take off its shoes. Lien arrives with a plastic bag of rambutans and advisories. “If they give you a script, you read it. If they ask you to cry, you tell them your eyes are expensive. If they want to rearrange the kitchen, let them move the stool but not the altar. If they try to make you cook with margarine branded with a man’s face, tell them your coconut is jealous.”

I laugh and then, because she knows my laugh better than I do, she touches my wrist and says, “And breathe. You bake like you breathe.”

That night, I go to work and my mop seems lighter because my head is full of a hundred small lights. Mr. Pham’s desk is tidy before I arrive, which means he has been watching me watching him. I line up the stapler not straight but millimeters off, because that is how he likes it, and think how every person’s luck leans a different way. The elevator’s blue numbers climb in slow worship. At one-thirty a.m., a power dip makes the lights go dim, then blaze, then steady. The servers hum like bees irritated by a sudden hand. I practice in my head the order in which I will say my name when the camera asks: My, like “mee.” Not Mai. Not Miss. My.

Friday morning the crew arrives with shoes wrapped in blue plastic that make them look like they are stepping into surgery. They carry lights like moons and soft boxes like suitcases for clouds. They stack cases in the hem, apologizing to the neighbor with the basil pots. The sound man has a shirt that says Silence, Please and the hem treats it like a joke delivered in a dialect it doesn’t speak. Phuong points everywhere with her pen and the cameraman, the boy with the gentle smile from the other night, asks if he can climb our stairs to look for an angle. “Angles are free,” Auntie tells him, sitting regal in her blue blouse, hair pinned in the style that was fashionable when girls wore their courage under their skirts. He laughs and tells her that angles are expensive when they hold story, and she nods as if he has recited a proverb.

They wire me with a small microphone that sticks to my chest with tape that tugs at the fine hairs I never think about. The sound man says, “When you move, think about the wire,” and I try to imagine my body like a cake I do not want to knock down. They position me at the counter and ask me to wash pandan leaves slowly. I feel foolish washing the same leaves twice, then twice again, until the cameraman sighs, “Beautiful,” like my rinsing is water teaching him to be patient. “Tell us about pandan,” Phuong says, standing just outside the frame. I tell them what I tell anyone who stands in my kitchen with a leaf between two fingers: that it smells like the part of a field when you are small and lying down, that it tastes like a color your tongue remembers without a dictionary, that if you listen closely you can hear your aunt’s footsteps moving from the stove to the sink, the rhythm of survival.

Auntie sits on the cot facing the camera with her legs crossed at the ankles, hands in her lap. They ask her to say my name and she does, clear, My, and then she drifts and calls me Em Bé, little girl, which is not untrue. “What did you teach her?” Phuong prompts gently, like she is coaxing a cat from under a car. “I taught her to taste with her nose first. And to use a bowl that is too small so she knows how to make room,” Auntie answers. The cameraman grins. “We will put that in the trailer,” he mouths.

We begin the cake. I crack eggs like knocking on a neighbor’s door. The bowls are clean, the whites slip like ghosts. I see my hands on the small monitor they have propped on the stool and they look like shoes that have walked far and still want to go somewhere. I whip the whites and the whisk leaves trails that stand, proud as soldiers at a small parade. The oven breathes in its corner like an old man napping. The cat from next door sneaks in and is bribeable with a prawn. The sound man says, “Hold for motorbike,” every time a bike coughs in the alley and I hold, mid-whisk, mid-breath. My arms begin to shake and that is real but they will cut it so I look effortless. Phuong tells me to look up at the camera when I talk about Auntie, not at Auntie. It feels rude and so I do both, like a person who doesn’t know which saint to pray to first.

When I slide the pan into the oven, the room holds its exhale like a secret. The oven hums. It clicks. It coughs, politely. It does not heat. I stand with my hand still on the door handle, smile locked and starting to ache, and the cameraman leans in almost imperceptibly, like a good friend leaning closer to hear the story you aren’t sure you want to tell. Phuong frowns at the outlet, the grip checks the cable, the electric world shrugs like a buffalo. “Power’s fine,” the grip says. The oven, offended by attention, decides that this is a good moment to switch off entirely, a small death like a fish deciding it has had enough of a bowl.

For a heartbeat I see the whole scene cut into a montage of disaster put to the music of a laugh track. My ribcage fills with a fizz that wants to be either tears or curses. The sound man’s shirt says Silence, Please. The hem’s quiet is expensive and will run out. I close the oven like I am tucking a baby that won’t sleep. “We steam,” I say, before the panic in Phuong’s eyes can spread. I turn to the stove and take out Auntie’s big aluminum pot with the dent that looks like a smile. “We steam bánh bông lan,” I repeat, louder to convince the air. “It will be softer than their soft lights.”

Phuong blinks. “But… the oven shot—” The cameraman is already moving, swinging his lens to the pot as if it were the sexiest thing he has seen this week. “Steaming is story,” he says. “We show problem, solution.” The grip pulls a rack from somewhere, as grips are magic men who can pull anything from somewhere, and I upend a small bowl inside the pot, cover it with a plate, and set the cake pan atop it like a precarious throne. I wrap the lid in a cloth to catch the condensation, an old trick from Auntie who learned from her sister who learned from a French woman who was afraid of drops on her genoise. The flame licks the pot’s belly and the water begins to murmur, a gossip that will soon boil. “Time?” Phuong says, already calmer, pen poised. “Twenty-five minutes,” I tell her, but really it is until the house smells like a color you can wear.

The steam fogs the camera for a moment and the cameraman laughs, wiping the lens with his shirt like a boy with glasses in the rain. The sound man leans into the doorway to get out of the steam and ends up in the auntie’s lap of conversation. She tells him about the year the monsoon wouldn’t stop, about making sweets under a roof that tried its best and still failed, about how you hold an umbrella with your teeth when both hands are beating egg whites. He loves her instantly as all good men do when introduced to a woman who refuses to apologize for what she knows.

Outside, the boys kick their ball softly against the wall and the ball comes back like a respectful tide. The noodle woman clears her throat in a way that tells us she’s not going to shout about hot broth if she can help it. The basil pots drink the light. I pace small circles and speak to the cake inside the pot. “Rise. Be brave. Do not take the steam personally.” It is ridiculous and yet my cakes respond to being spoken to like shy people do.

They interview me while we wait, because time is money and money is a timer in this profession. “What do you like more, cleaning or baking?” Phuong asks, tilting her head like a sparrow. “That is like asking if I prefer salt to water,” I say, then try again because I can see her eyebrows making notes. “Cleaning gives me a border to hold on to, baking fills the middle. One without the other and my day falls apart like a badly folded batter.” The cameraman smiles without looking away from me. “That line is free,” he says. “You’re welcome,” I reply, and the grip chokes on a laugh.

When I lift the lid, the steam kisses my face and I feel my pores applaud. The cake has risen, modestly but bravely, a wide soft cheek. My knife slides in and comes out clean as a secret told to the right person. I take the pan to the table and lay it on a rack while the camera watches, greedy but polite. “You don’t flip right away?” Phuong asks, because some viewers will be purists with aprons hanging like formal gowns. “If I do, it sulks,” I say. “Let it think about its life for a moment.”

I cut it when the top gives a gentle push back under my finger. Square, like Auntie says, all corners safe. She clucks her tongue at my first slice and I fix it, the camera drinking in the ritual. We plate with banana leaves because porcelain makes the cake shiver. The sponsor wants a certain box in frame and Phuong arranges it so the label peeks like a shy child. It is foolish and it is a language I decide to speak for today because I need what it buys. We eat on camera, and they ask us to take the first bite twice. Auntie closes her eyes and hums like a kettle coming to boil. The cameraman looks a little alarmed at his own happiness and takes another piece without asking whether he is allowed.

The hem applauds. The sound man caves and removes his Silence, Please sign with both hands, smiling as if he has been found out. The noodle woman sends in a bowl of broth and we pour it into cups because there are not enough bowls, because there never are and somehow there always are. Phuong relaxes all at once, like a string that realizes it was tied too tight. “This,” she says, “is why we bring cameras to kitchens.”

They shoot more little pieces: my hand on the aloe vera plant outside the door, my feet in slippers, the mop leaning with dignity in its corner. They ask me to say “Don’t panic” because they like the way the words sit in my mouth and I do, softly, because I like the reference and because I am a woman whose mornings are built on surviving small emergencies until they gather and call themselves a life. They film Auntie holding my apron like a prayer flag and telling the lens to stop looking directly at her because it is rude. The lens obeys.

When the last cable is rolled and the lights peel themselves from our walls, the room feels like a body after a fever: damp, grateful, slightly shocked. The crew leaves a bag of leftover bao buns and two packets of instant coffee as if we have hosted a distant cousin. The cameraman squeezes my shoulder in that professional way that is almost intimacy. “You were good,” he says. “Not good like television. Good like you.” It is a sentence that I will fold and put under my pillow.

After they disappear into the hem and become story for our neighbors’ dinners, I sink onto the step and lean back until my head bumps the door. Auntie sits next to me and pats my knee, not hard enough to bruise, just enough to let me know I am solid. “You did not panic,” she declares. “The oven panicked, the city panicked, but not you.”

“I panicked,” I confess into the alley air. “I just didn’t let it out of the house.”

“Teach me that,” she says, and her eyes are milkier in the afternoon light, clouds behind a window. “Teach me to keep it inside when I forget which pocket I am wearing my name in.”

I put my head on her shoulder and she rests her cheek on my hair. For a moment the new and the old press together again and pretend there is no seam.

That evening, as we are wrapping pandan in wet paper to please tomorrow, Ms. Thu phones. “We need you tonight,” she says without greeting, and the background sounds like a storm of photocopiers. “The twenty-sixth floor is hosting a partner tomorrow and they changed their minds and now want to smell lemons at dawn.”

“I can come,” I say, and feel my bones groan like a bridge asked to hold one more cart. “But next week, Monday to Wednesday, I have—” and I stop short of saying the word television because it feels like something fragile that could break if I say it to the wrong person.

“I know,” she says, after a pause that surprises both of us. “I saw the crew in your hem. The noodle woman told the egg man and the egg man told my sister-in-law, and so on. Go. Do your baking show. Come here Thursday and clean like a person with new shoes.” Something in me unclenches. I offer to bring her a slice and she says, “Bring me the part with a crack. That is where the true taste is.”

At work that night, the tower feels like a different planet because now I have been in the studio with its aluminum moons. I roll my trolley down the corridor and the floor seems to nod back at me. Anh Minh at the lobby desk has his helmet on his knee and a handsome new thermos. He tips his helmet anyway and says, “A star returns.” I tell him about steaming a cake while the whole city stood on one foot and he laughs and says, “If the electricity goes out in this building we call you,” as if I am a woman who carries matches under her tongue.

In the morning, I sleep the sleep of someone who has been watched all day and performed basic human activities as if they were magic tricks. The dream I have is plain: I am folding egg whites, and the bowl is a sky, and my arm is a crane lifting clouds into a second sky that belongs to me. I wake up with my arm sore and a line of drool on the pillow that Auntie sees and chooses not to comment on. We eat leftover steamed cake with coffee and argue about whether it is ruder to eat the last piece or to pretend it is not there.

The wardrobe email arrives while I am scraping honey out of a jar with a finger. “Brighter colors for studio,” it says. “Avoid white on white set. Avoid stripes that dance on camera. No logos. No political slogans. Bring one item that feels like home.” I look at the clothesline in the alley and see our life waving. My blouses are dignified in their understatement. My trousers know how to be humble. Lien has a shirt the color of dragonfruit that might blind the host and the thought gives me pleasure. She brings it over and we pin it with clothespins to see how it might lie. I cannot do it. I look like a fruit pretending to be hard candy. The neighbor with the banana fritters suggests her embroidered áo bà ba, cream with rows of tiny green leaves. It fits like a story that doesn’t need to be stretched. Tuan brings a roll of soft leather and he and Auntie sew a pocket onto the inside of my apron for the thermometer I don’t own. “Put a pandan leaf in it,” Auntie instructs, and I do, and I smell like home in a way money cannot argue with.

On Sunday, at the studio orientation, the air is refrigerated and perfumed in a way that makes my nose embarrassed. We are ten finalists in this round, a bouquet of kinds of sweetness. There is a woman from the delta with hands like bread who calls me em and tells me she sells coconut candies that break the hearts of men in boats. There is a man from District 7 with a jaw like a knife who runs a pâtisserie where the boxes probably cost more than my rent. There is a girl with hair the color of unripe papaya who is famous on an app and practices smiling in a mirror shaped like a heart. There is a quiet boy who smells like butter and speaks about sourdough like a shy lover. There is an auntie with lacquered hair who wears pearls to the walk-through and whispers prayers to the oven door when she thinks no one is looking.

The host glides in with a breeze that smells faintly of cloves. His charisma clicks on like a switch and he shines in a way light knows how to follow. He shakes our hands and his palm is cool and dry as paper. “Welcome,” he says, and it sounds like he is giving us a country. He tells a joke about sugar that would not be funny on a bus but here makes some people giggle because any sound they make he can make into applause. He is smaller in person, which feels like a relief, like discovering the moon is reachable if you stack enough chairs.

They show us the set. It is brighter than you think brightness can be. Four ovens stand shoulder to shoulder, stainless steel as uncommitted as politicians. I touch the handle of the one at station three with the tips of my fingers and it is like shaking hands with someone who will become a rival and a friend. The counters are at a height that makes my elbows wonder who they need to be. The pantry is organized to look casual and photogenic, all flour in glass that views itself in the mirror, all sugar arranged like small snowbanks. A woman with a headset tells us where to stand when we are overwhelmed so the camera can see our faces understand something new. She tells us what to do if we cut ourselves (call for a medic, do not bleed on camera unless it is charming), where the bathrooms are (farther than you want them to be), where the “confessional” is (a small room with a chair where you tell the nation your secrets with a producer nodding as if they have never heard a secret before).

We are fitted with aprons that do not remember our mothers. I tuck my flowered one under theirs like a conversation under a blanket. The woman with the headset tells us, “Breathe, smile, do not look into Camera Two when it is blinking at you, pay no attention to the sponsor in the corner watching you like a chicken at market.” She is brisk and kind, a nurse who has seen everything except perhaps a bowl of egg whites talk back.

We practice the walk-in. We practice the look of purposeful rushing that is actually half choreography. The influencer girl floats as if her shoes have been taught to refuse gravity. The delta woman plants her feet like a tree that will not be moved by stairs. The District 7 man slips through air like a knife through ripe mango. I know what I look like: a cleaner in her good blouse, trying to step softly so as not to mop up the sky.

They ask us to talk to the camera about our “journey.” I do not have a suitcase word like that, so I say the names of the people who have carried me: Dì Lan, Lien, Tuan, Ms. Thu, Anh Minh, the neighbor with the basil pots, the noodle woman, the boy with the ball who stopped kicking for one perfect minute. The producer nods, eyes misting in a way that might be genuine or professional or both. “Say it again,” she says, and I do, and this time my voice slips on the name of my aunt and I let it, because if you cannot misstep with your own life then what is the point of a dance.

On the bus home, I lean my head against the window and the city slides by in strips of neon and motorbike orange. At a stoplight, a woman presses a bag of boiled peanuts to the glass and I almost buy them because I want the small weight in my palm. An old man sleeps with his cap over his face and his mouth open, and his wife watches the world for him. I write in my head the list of what I will pre-measure and label in our kitchen so that on the day my hands can be eyes and not calculators. I imagine the judge’s face when he tastes pandan and cannot find the exact story to pin to it. I imagine my oven at home, now chastened by the presence of its cousins, choosing to burn with loyalty.

At the hem, someone has drawn a hopscotch of numbers that skips the number four and the children hop without complaint as if the world has always been missing a step. I step around it and think about luck and its corners. Auntie is awake, the radio a murmur about someone’s son who fell in love with a girl through a wall. She has unpicked one seam in my apron and re-sewn it with a stitch as even as a rosary. “I gave you stronger thread,” she says, touching the seam as if it is a nerve. “So when you stand there in the cold light, the stitches will hold. They will not betray what is heavy inside you.”

I wash rice for dinner, letting the water go cloudy until it clears. I empty the bin of onion skins and mango peels. I run the rag over the table and feel that old calm in the way the wood darkens under the cloth. The day after tomorrow I will stand in a place that pretends to be a kitchen and I will pretend to not be afraid, and I will measure flour like prayers and eggs like promises, and I will speak to my batter and it will listen. Tonight, I am in the only kitchen that knows my footsteps. The fan complains. The neighbor sings a love song too high for her throat and gives up halfway and laughs. The city out there goes on with its work of proving that too many people can fit in a lane if they believe it. I breathe, slow. I lay out my tools like soldiers on a table that has known drafts and spills and sudden confessions, and I tell them, softly, so the words don’t fray when they hit the world, “We will not panic. We will bake. We will be square with our corners. We will remember.”The morning we were to film the final, the city had the decency to be soft. The rain came early as a whisper that rinsed the roofs and left the jacaranda blooms scattered like stamps. I woke before the alarm because my chest had been awake all night, counting imaginary minutes. Auntie was already sitting up, hair in its stubborn rolls, the little plastic bag of salt on the table like a charm. She had set my apron neatly folded over the chair with a pandan leaf tucked into the new pocket as if she were tucking a letter into a soldier’s coat. We boiled sweet ginger tea in the dented pot and stood at the doorway sharing sips as the hem yawned and stretched into its day. Lien came in squinting at the sky, declared it good luck for rain to mop the street for us, and tied a red thread around my wrist with fingers that were brisk for my sake. Tuan turned up with his hair combed like a student on exam day and a cloth in his pocket that he used to wipe imaginary dust from my shoes. He did not make jokes and that was his big joke, and I told him he looked like a man who was about to propose to a carburetor.

They sent a van. The driver wore white gloves and a face of polite ignorance about the hem’s peculiar angles, and the van nosed in and the hem breathed and made room and the boys pulled their ball close, and we climbed in with our bag that held the items which were not on any official list but which anyone sensible knows are part of a kitchen: a spoon with a bite mark at the handle that tells you exactly where your hand belongs, a strip of banana leaf because porcelain can make a cake shy, a rag that has seen as much life as some wisps of hair. Auntie sat beside me and kept one hand on the apron like she was steadier if she felt its fabric. The city slid by, blinking its wet lashes. In another life, I might have looked at the spotless dashboard and wondered what it felt like to belong in this smooth-lit world where floors gleam for themselves. In this life, I checked my bag three times and told my breath to act its age.

The studio was colder than the sky and smelled faintly of sugar that had learned to be a perfume. We were shepherded into the green room which was not green but the neutral of money, where chamomile tea bags and disappointing biscuits sat on a tray under plastic as if they were works of art. The other finalists looked like versions of courage. The delta woman in a neat gray blouse had a little pouch of coconut shaved that she kept touching like a worry bead. The District 7 man, whose jaw could skewer a fruit, wore a shirt that knew how to be photographed and did not speak except in directions to his assistant who hovered like a reflection. The sourdough boy took off his glasses and cleaned them every time a producer called someone’s name. The influencer girl had a small stack of pastel spatulas which she arranged and rearranged with the concentration of a surgeon. We all smiled the kind of smile people make on ferries as the river widens and the engine makes its own decision.

They pinned numbers to our stations and handed us aprons heavy with their brand. I tied mine and then tied my own over it, the flowers faded into an almost thereness. The headset woman, whose kindness had the speed of efficiency, ran through the day. There would be three rounds: the Memory Bake, when we would make a childhood remembered without telling them its name until they tasted; the Technical, sprung upon us with the gentle malice of television; and the Final Build, which was a showpiece that made sponsors sigh and home bakers both admire and swear they would never attempt. She told us where to stand when our souls left our bodies and where to look when the camera asked for eyes. Then she clapped her hands like a teacher calling us in from a storm and it began in the way a storm begins: one drop and then everything.

The host glittered like a slice of glass with the light behind it. He said our names and called me “Mai” first and then “My” as I corrected him, and he made a show of saying it twice, “My like ‘mee,’” as though the language was a pet trick and he had learned it for us. The judges stood with the posture of saints in paintings. Chef Huy had the careful haircut of someone whose knives had been introduced to more people than his jokes had. He had trained in Paris and chose to let us know this by the way he sniffed at the ovens like they should greet him in French. Ms. Hoa, who had written cookbooks that had sat on coffee tables and at the backs of stalls where women copied recipes by hand, wore pearls and a smile that did not look innocent. They shook hands, they explained the rules, they said this was a celebration of sugar and story and cities, and then they stepped back and let time become a weapon.

For Memory Bake, I had argued with myself until the rain cooled my mind. I could do the pandan chiffon; I could do the steamed sponge that had saved the day when the oven chose to sulk; I could make bánh da lợn in silver rings, layered green and yellow like rice fields under a plane whose engine keeps faith. In the end, I planned a small square of honeycomb cake, bánh bò nướng, whose heart was a green cathedral of tunnels and whose skin was brown as a promise kept. It was a cake that forgave you if you were gentle with it and ruined you if you lied to it. It was a cake that wanted the oven hot like a conversation and was stubborn in the way that would make Auntie smirk and say, “This one is our relation.”

The countdown started, the music snuck in like a third judge, and we rushed without running. I arranged my station the way I arrange a desk I will clean: everything with a place, every place with a wish. I whispered to the batter in the rhythm my arms knew, heated the pan until it hummed like a good neighbor, and poured with a hand that remembered the slosh and the stop. The smell made me want to sit down and close my eyes because if I were a scent I would choose that one to be. The ovens, sleek and obedient, watched us without expression; mine blinked its numbers and then steadied like an apology for the cousin at home. The influencer girl piped pastel onto a sponge so thin it could be worn like a veil. The delta woman tossed coconut into sugar with a flick that looked like luck. The District 7 man used a thermometer that looked expensive enough to have a passport. We were a choir of mixed intentions.

When I pulled my pan and flipped the cake onto the rack, it came away like a stubborn child deciding finally to be generous. The interior was the right green, not the crude green of envy but the gentle green of water under leaves. The tunnels were there, little beehives that made me think of maps to a place I might get to if I could make my life rise this way. I cut squares, not triangles, steady in my obedience to corners. I plated them on banana leaves and put a small dish of salt and green chili on the tray because the mouth wants surprises even when it is being filmed. I looked up to find the camera close, as if it were the face of a person who loved me very much and couldn’t help it.

When the judges came, I listened to the polite throat-clearing of producers clearing space around them with invisible hands. The host lifted a square and held it in the light. The tunnels showed themselves like secrets confessed only because they trust the room. He took a bite and his pupils did that thing pupils do when they are reporting to a brain that has been surprised by joy. Chef Huy tapped the knife on the table as if it were a conductor’s baton and said something about control of heat and fermentation and the way the sugar had been allowed to go just to the edge of bitter without falling off. Ms. Hoa wiped her finger along the banana leaf and licked the salt and chili and looked at me with a mouth that knew too much and said, “You have remembered the country and the alley, both,” and I felt my ribs loosen like stitches in a seam that someone had knocked their shoulder against. I did not cry because I had promised the wardrobe woman not to, but I let the laughter sit in my cheeks like a slice of fruit.

In the confessional, in the small room where a chair waited with the patience of furniture, the producer leaned in with compassion you could stack. “Tell us what this cake means,” she asked, and I wanted to say that it means we survived childhoods and power outages and arguments between aunties and the way money is a song you only learn to sing by listening at other people’s windows. I told her instead that it meant that sometimes air becomes structure if you treat it like a guest. She nodded and scribbled and said, “Say that again but with an adjective,” and I added “polite” in a place where adjectives probably go and she looked relieved, as if I had paid her back for a debt I did not know I owed.

The Technical came with the grin of a man who has hidden a snake in a basket and is waiting to be admired for his mischief. They took away our recipes and handed us a page with measurements and verbs only, and there was a picture of a cake that looked simple in the way a face looks simple if you have never loved it. “Gateau opéra,” the host announced, and the air changed its temperature because this was a word that made men puff their chests and women roll their eyes in kitchens. Layers of almond sponge, coffee syrup, coffee buttercream, ganache, glaze; this was the sort of thing that made the District 7 man look like he had woken from a dream in which he had been kissed. The delta woman sighed and crossed herself discreetly. The sourdough boy stared at the picture like it was an animal he would have to name and then set free.

I do not make gateau opéra in my kitchen unless the moon demands theater, but I have read recipes in borrowed magazines and I have held my breath watching videos on the net café computer while the owner pretended not to count my minutes. I separated eggs with my hands because my fingers are smarter than any gadget. I folded and prayed to small gods of crumb and structure. I made coffee syrup that could have been served to gods if gods enjoyed bitterness softened by patience. My butter and sugar flirted with one another, the buttercream did not curdle out of spite, the ganache shone because I bullied it and then apologized. The glaze was the part where people sell their souls and I would be telling a prettier story if I said it obeyed like a good child, but it thought about becoming a mirror and then remembered it had been made by someone who keeps her measuring cups in a plastic bowl with a crack taped over, and it showed its streaks like scars that do not ask for excuses.

We lined up our slices like a police identification. The judges cut with the gravity of people whose tongues are about to decide a small country's fate. The District 7 man’s layers were so even that I thought they had been measured by a tool that lives in God’s pocket. The influencer girl’s glaze reflected the studio lights like a fairy pond at a theme park. The delta woman’s buttercream was a little loose in a way that made me want to hold her wrist and whisper, “It doesn’t matter.” Mine had the courage to stand and the humility to tremble slightly, and when the judges tasted, Chef Huy’s eyebrows agreed with themselves, and Ms. Hoa said, “The coffee talks to me in the voice of morning markets,” which is a compliment only a person with sesame oil in their veins can give. The host hacked another piece off the District 7 man’s to take home, which is fairness as television measures it.

We ate a piece of our own slices behind the set because you cannot put this much sugar into a room and not let some of it go home in your body. I licked ganache off my thumb and felt like a child in a temple, doing something delicious bringing me closer to a scolding that would never quite arrive. The sourdough boy looked at me and said, “I forgot to breathe,” and I told him to save it for his confessional and he smiled as if I had offered him a nap.

The Final Build was to be a piece that represented the city in sugar. They said “city” and I thought of glass towers like frozen rain and men in shoes that coordinate with their phones. I also thought of our hem, our alley sleeping like dogs and waking like roosters, and the way the radio says “don’t panic” to people who are boiling sweet potato at dawn. I had made a plan that would either make the judges sigh like ex-wives or clap like aunties. I would build a small square city of cakes, each a tile, each a neighborhood, all arranged on a board like a planner’s dream and a grandma’s cutting board. The base would be coconut pandan sponge because the nose must lead the feet. The squares would be iced with different colors stolen from real life: a gray made from black sesame that looked like weathered cement, a soft pink from dragonfruit that insisted on being itself, a yellow kissed by turmeric like morning on the flanks of monks. On top of some, I would pipe lines for alleys and draw small motorbikes with chocolate; on others, I would place tiny squares of banana leaf as parks. The tower would be a jelly of coffee set in a glass ring, trembling with the honesty of modern architecture. I would resist the temptation to make anything triangular because I refuse to let my luck bleed.

Time became a bird I had to hold without crushing. The piping bag felt like a pen but with a worse temper. The chocolate fought me in the air conditioning and then melted with unfaithful speed under the lights that wanted me to glow. Phuong glided in and out, asking if I needed more powdered sugar like a person asking if I would like to change my life. The cameraman hovered at my shoulder, his lens breathing with me, and when my hand jerked because a motorbike somewhere coughed and the line I was drawing for the river turned into a small accidental oxbow, he murmured, “Better,” and I believed him because my body wanted permission to forgive itself.

I had built the coffee tower to the height allowed by either physics or sponsorship, and it trembled in a way that made me feel protective and resentful at the same time. The District 7 man had made a cathedral out of tempered chocolate that would have made the French lean forward and tilt their heads and declare it a bridge. The influencer girl had assembled a city of macarons, each one labeled in calligraphy that made me feel a small mean joy when the humidity bruised it. The delta woman had made a river on her board in syrup and floated little boats of caramel in it, and I wanted her to be my cousin. The sourdough boy built a skyline of choux puffs because people think choux is like bread for people who admired swans.

Five minutes. The host’s voice could have been a knife or a spoon depending on how you heard it. I began to lay the last tiles, the sesame gray, the turmeric gold, the dragonfruit pink. I put down a small square iced with pandan green and could not help but mark it with a tiny line like the hem, and I set two dots for the basil pots and almost cried like a fool. I piped a thin curve of white chocolate for the river and it broke because white chocolate is a coward, and I patched it with a fondant strip that had the sweetness of a lie, and then I hid the seam with a line of crushed peanuts because that is how women fix the world. When the music rose and the air tightened and the countdown hit numbers that made the producers’ eyes gleam, I stepped back and noticed that the coffee tower leaned like a secret. I put my palm on the table near it and spoke to it like a boy on a motorbike who tells you he will do better. “You do not fall,” I said, and it thought about it and then it did not.

We stood back like people who have just built boats and are waiting to see if the water is cruel. The judges walked slowly in a way that made you want to pull them by their sleeves. They went first to the District 7 monument because the camera had been flirting with it since the moment he opened his tempered chocolate like a fan. They admired, they poked, they discovered the glaze inside reflected their faces and they judged it a miracle, because mirrors make people feel important. They went to the influencer’s city of buttons and were charmed until a macaron roof slid and then they smiled with the meanness of children who have caught other children in a lie. They stood at the delta woman’s river and Ms. Hoa put her finger in the syrup and licked it and closed her eyes in a way that meant she was somewhere else, and when she opened them the woman had won something no sponsor could buy.

At my board, Chef Huy bent to peer at the banana leaf park and the motorbike drawn like a small prayer. He put his ear to the coffee tower as if to hear the city breathing. He cut a square of sesame gray and tasted and made that little noncommittal hum I had learned means “we will be kind if you put your elbows back into their sockets.” He ate the turmeric and his eyes did a polite dance. He bit the pandan and his shoulders dropped and I relaxed because shoulders tell the truth first. Ms. Hoa chewed like a person receiving a letter and said, “You have made the city into apartments of taste. People will quarrel about which one is theirs,” and I despised and adored the metaphor. The host asked me to tell the audience what each square meant and I could have made a sermon, but I pointed and said, “This is the market, this is the office, this is the alley, this is the park where men drink coffee and decide whether or not to go home. This is the tower where I clean. This is the hem where we wave. The river is crooked because we forgive ourselves badly and then better.” The cameraman took a long breath and I counted it as applause.

They sent us out while they deliberated in a room behind glass that tries to hide gossip. We stood in the hallway near a stack of boxes that smelled like glue and doldrums and pretended to be people who do not care about their fates. The District 7 man made a call in French without moving his mouth and I learned the word for “sabotage” as it is said by someone who thinks the universe is a grandchild that misbehaves just to please him. The influencer girl rubbed her wrist and someone else rubbed her back and the circle of care tightened around her as if kindness wears glitter sometimes. The delta woman took a small packet out of her pocket and ate a cube of coconut candy and handed me one and I bit and thought, saltedness and sugar are neighbors. The sourdough boy leaned his head on the wall and I saw the small bald spot where stress had kissed him and felt that affection for strangers that makes cities possible.

The host called us in. I could feel my soul try to climb into my mouth and I swallowed it like a large pill. The lights warmed as if the sun had taken a job here. The judges had the faces of people who have played chess on a train. They praised, they gently chastised, they said words like “elevated” and “respect” and “textural” and “narrative” which in our mothers’ languages means “chewable, not too sweet, tastes like something other than a magazine.” They called the names of those who were safe and those who were excellent and those who were going home to be hugged by people who would not tell them their glaze had broken in front of a nation. They spoke my name second, not first, which is an art in itself, and told me that my Memory Bake had been a whisper that filled a room and that my city tiles had a sense of humor my Technical hadn’t. I heard Tuan whoop somewhere he wasn’t supposed to be, because his voice is shaped like a wrench on concrete and it travels in a crowd like an honest rumor.

We had to stand for photographs that will look like joy from the outside and like survival from the inside. The wardrobed assistants straightened collars as if they were sculpting minor gods. The host’s hand touched my shoulder exactly long enough to be captured and not long enough to be sued. The judges went to a corner and took off their expressions like coats and I saw Ms. Hoa massage her cheekbones with two fingers and I loved her a little. They called in the sponsor who shook each of our hands in a way that pinched a little, like he was remembering coins in his childhood. He said things about tradition and modernity that would look good in a press release, and I smiled and thought of my apron’s small brown stain and of Auntie telling me that bitterness is a dye you use on your tongue so sweet can be seen.

When they let us go, the evening was already making its arrangements. I found the green room and found Auntie with her blue blouse unbuttoned at the top button and her hair slightly defeated and her eyes bright as if she had been kept alive by watching my hands on a monitor. She stood carefully, not trusting the bones to remember what they had promised, and she clapped for me as if the room were a private stage. “You did not panic,” she declared, as if anyone needed to be told this is the headline. I told her she had been the loudest person in the room without saying a word and she pretended to be offended and then took my hand. We walked out into the corridor where the world became again a place of cables and coffee cups and men in headsets with secrets that are small and professional. Phuong stopped me and said, “Home segment is beautiful. The steam saved our day. Tonight, sleep. Tomorrow we film the small interviews and plates. Do not answer texts from numbers that begin with 09 and say they are from the newspaper unless you are bored enough to be lied to.”

The van was not there because no van can find a woman exactly when she needs to be returned to a life. Tuan’s motorbike was there, purring like a cat that wants praise. He let Auntie climb on and pressed her helmet down until the strap caught her chin and she swatted his hand as if he were flirting. We rode home through a city that was pleased with itself; the rain had rinsed the dust and the neon had decided to be generous and people were sweet from watching someone else do something hard. The hem had been waiting; the noodle woman leaned in her doorway with her ladle like a baton, the boys tried to look casual with their ball immediately underfoot, the basil pots looked lifted because plants understand victory better than humans. We gave them the leftover biscuits from the green room and they ate them as if they were a foreign animal that had wandered into our alley and begged to be named.

Lien sat us down and put bowls of soup in our hands as if we had come back from sea. She did not ask if I had won because she understands that winning is too narrow a word for days like this. She said instead, “What did you ruin that you fixed,” and I told her about the white chocolate river and we laughed until I was tired. The new neighbor with the banana fritters sent her youngest daughter to my step with a bowl of sticky rice colored the color of dawn and we ate and nodded as if we were inspecting birds. The grandfather upstairs played his guitar much too soft for his usual pleasure and I felt a gratitude that was not loud because my body could not carry more.

Late, when the alley’s radios were tired and the big city’s engines had slowed, I stepped outside with the rag I had packed this morning and wiped down the table because tonight it felt like a ritual and not a job. Auntie fell asleep with the television on a volume that would have embarrassed her younger self and her mouth slightly open, and I tucked a pandan leaf in the edge of her pillowcase because if it held dreams I wanted them green and forgiving. I washed the bowl I had used to beat butter until it squeaked under my palm. I dried the knives because knives deserve to be dry. I stood with my hands on the sink and looked at the cracked wall where a line of ants decided to try their luck, and when one slipped I put my finger near and let it find its path.

The next day we went back because if there is one thing television loves more than triumph it is close-ups. We sat in the confessional again and I told the producer about the first time I understood sugar could cut as well as sweeten, and she nodded and asked me to repeat it and to say the word “balance” from my own mouth and not borrowed from someone else’s hard candy. They filmed my hands putting a cake on a stand as if they were filming a ceremony and perhaps they were. The cameraman, who wore a new shirt but the same gentle silence, asked me if he could photograph my apron and I said yes and he pressed the shutter as if it might startle the flowers and then he showed me the screen and my heart went sideways because I had never seen my life lit like that without feeling it was for someone else.

In a hallway that smelled like new paint, I ran into the District 7 man without his armor. He held two little plastic containers of custard and looked like a person who had misplaced a small country. He told me in a voice he had not used on camera that his father had wanted him to be an engineer and had died still wanting that, and that when he tempered chocolate today he had spoken his father’s name under his breath so the sugar would not feel like a betrayal. I did not know this man and I knew him. I told him that when I steamed a cake in my dented pot my aunt had told me I was boiling the rain, and he smiled in a way that made that jaw no less dangerous but more human.

At home, the days that followed had peaks and puddles. The hem continued to send in small delegations with offerings of bean sprout bouquets and poems in gossip form. People asked me if they could borrow my name when theirs felt inadequate on forms. Ms. Thu took me off Monday’s roster without pretending she was doing me a favor and with a sigh that conceded my absence was a tide and tides are no one’s idea except the moon’s. The security guard at the tower told me a story about the time he wanted to sing on television and how he had not because his mother had been sick, and for a moment in the lobby our stories met like fingers and then politely let go because there were people with briefcases watching.

The episode would air in weeks. We were bound by the contract that asked us to keep our mouths shut in a world that loves to open them. I could not say who had been named winner in the show’s vocabulary and who had been named poem in mine. I could only hold the knowledge like a small hot bread that you do not bite because good things are also impatient and you must not give in to them entirely. The day they would air would be a day like any other with more noodles and more laughter and more phone calls from numbers that wanted to sell me insurance for appliances I do not own. The city did not stop to wait for my segment to run, and I respected it for that because the city is an auntie too.

On a Wednesday when the humidity sat like an extra auntie in the room, Auntie forgot where the kitchen was. It was a small forgetting, the kind we will pretend was a joke to make fear go thin enough to pass. She stood, took three steps, turned, and faced a place that had been hers longer than I have had a face, and she looked surprised like a child in a house that had been cleaned too well. I was holding the whisk from our morning’s egg whites and I put it down and took her elbow and made a joke about how the kitchen had decided to move because it didn’t like its view. She did that laugh that comes with being rescued from embarrassment, the laugh you nail into a wall so the house doesn’t list. We made tea and it tasted like relief and like something else I did not want to name.

That night I brought home a mango from Anh Minh because I felt like a person in a story should bring home a mango at this point. We cut it and the sweet made the air thick and we ate it with salt and chili because we are people who cannot leave well enough alone. After, I sat at the table and arranged my knives on the towel and I thought about how many forms of sharpness I had learned to live with. The show had made me visible in a way that felt like wearing a mirror, and people in the market had paused and looked for a breath longer than you look when you are just counting change. Visibility is a coin that buys certain things and exacts others, and I felt for it and found it was still in my pocket. I folded the towel and locked the door and checked the gas and touched the altar and when I got under the sheet I said a thank you to the gods and the ovens and to anyone listening who was in charge of aquariums for souls.

On the Saturday when the crew returned to pick up an establishing shot they had forgotten because even professionals forget small things in the face of big), a boy no older than sixteen held the boom mic like a flag and asked me, not on camera, if I was scared of what would happen if everything changed. I wanted to tell him that change is like the monsoon; it comes whether or not you have laundry on the line; it demands rearrangements; it makes new life in the ditch and rots what you were sure would last. I told him instead that I was scared and that I was not, that I had three kinds of rice and a clean rag and an aunt who remembers my name even on the days she does not remember where the salt lives. He nodded like a man and lifted the boom when Tuan swung in with his motorbike as if he were entering a parade.

Weeks later, when the episode aired and our hem was a riot of chairs and bodies and somebody’s cousin brought a television that was too large for the space and yet did not knock the basil pots off their dignity, we watched ourselves in the company of our own ghosts. The sound on the television did not match our speakers exactly so the laughter came in waves that overlapped and I loved it because timing is a lie we tell clocks. People screamed when they saw my kitchen, not because it was beautiful but because it was theirs. The noodle woman put down her ladle in time with the cut to Auntie’s face and people stood as if for an anthem. Tuan cried when the white chocolate river broke and tried to pretend he had burned his mouth on his tea. Lien shouted at the television when the host called me “Mai” and the whole hem corrected him at once and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. When the judges praised the tunnel of the honeycomb cake, the boys looked into the set’s reflection on the screen and flexed their own small muscles as if strength could go in many directions and still count.

I did not become a person who could not walk down my own alley without my life asking to be seen. People bought my cakes before I had time to make them, and I learned to say no in a way that didn’t turn into a confession. The law firm on the twenty-sixth floor decided their partners would enjoy a dessert platter once a week and they paid in the kind of envelope that made me stand very straight and say “thank you” twice. Ms. Thu gave me more flexibility in my shifts not because she had been moved by art but because the office now appreciated the smell of pandan on their documents and she was a woman with an eye for commodity and weather. The studio wrote to ask if I would consider returning for a holiday special, and I wrote back that I would consider it the way a woman considers buying a second pair of good shoes; with desire and calculation and a memory of the last time she stepped in a puddle.

Auntie woke one night and thought the radio was a child calling her and I sat and turned the volume down until the music was a thread we could hold. She fell asleep with her hand on my wrist and I sat still because sometimes we are the hook and sometimes we are the fish and on lucky nights we are both and the water is gentle. When I looked at my apron hanging on its nail, I saw that the flowers had faded to almost nothing and I thought, there is a day coming when the fabric will rip and no seam will want to hold it, and on that day I will fold it and lay it next to the altar like anyone lays an object that has carried more than its share, and I will thank it and not ask it to please one more customer.

One afternoon, a woman came to the hem in a white blouse and a face that said she had eaten at restaurants where chairs are selected by committees. She wanted an order of cakes for her daughter’s school ceremony, small squares with sharp corners, nothing that leaks, please, nothing that requires an explanation. I made them the way I make anything; I sifted the flour over a bowl that had seen better bowls; I spoke to the batter and asked it for patience I do not always deserve; I cut exact. When she came to collect and I handed the boxes over, she paused, frowned, and asked if I could do triangles instead because they looked more “festive.” For a second I felt the hot flash of two girls sliding down temple steps and getting caught. I told her I do not make triangles for ceremonies, that triangles are sharp and I will not be responsible for cutting anyone’s luck, and she looked at me as if I had asked her to switch religions. Then she smiled, shrugged, and said, “Squares are good. Squares stack,” and I watched a small belief step from one body to another without a fight. After she left, Auntie nodded at me from her chair where she had been pretending not to listen, and in that nod we signed a treaty, old nation to new, cake country to broom kingdom.

On a day when the light made everything slow, Phuong sent a message that had no schedule in it and therefore felt like a love note. “Viewers loved the home segment,” she wrote, and then, as if she had been taught this by another woman in another kitchen, “The steam looked like grace.” I read it aloud to Auntie and she said, “Steam is cheap and grace is expensive; trick them when you can,” and we laughed because laughter is the only way to tell secrets too large for a room. That evening, the neighbor with the banana fritters brought me a slice of boiled cassava cake and told me the barber had finally learned to make a straight part on their youngest and I said this is the real miracle and meant it.

There were days that felt hollow because nothing was broken and no one needed me to fix a cake or a sentence. There were days when a mop felt more honest than a whisk and I chose the mop and did not apologize to anyone for cleaning something on a day when my name had been on television. There were nights when Lien and I lay on the floor because the chairs were hot and the floor was cooler and looked at the ceiling and told each other the biggest things in small words. There were hours when Tuan sat on my step and taught me the names of the metal parts of his motorbike and I told him the names of the parts of my oven and we marveled that we had, between us, devoted our lives to heat that chooses not to obey.

The city remained itself. The tower still flashed its lights like bleached bones at the river. The hem still collected and released like a lung. The market still punished you if you went late for basil and rewarded you if you came late for gossip. My name still required the extra sentence—My, like “mee”—and increasingly people knew to give it to me without my asking and that was a tiny luxury I could not have anticipated. The radio still said “don’t panic” about egg whites and stocks and the weather that refuses to sign contracts, and I still answered, sometimes aloud, “I won’t,” and sometimes, because I am not perfect and because perfection is an insult to the days that are difficult, I said, “I will, but look how well I do it.”Chapter 6

After the episode aired, the hem shifted on its axis by a thumb’s width. It was not a revolution, more like the way you feel a table has become a little sturdier because someone has tightened the legs. People still argued over prices and spilt fish sauce and sang too loud and put their backs into living, but every now and then their eyes went soft when they looked at me, and the softness was like a gust that made the curtains breathe. The noodle woman tucked an extra spoonful of broth into my bowl like a secret and then pretended she had miscounted. The egg man kept a bag under the table labeled “My,” a scribble the color of yolk, and inside it the eggs were the ones with centers the color of monks’ robes. The basil pots seemed to grow with more confidence on the steps, or perhaps I was the one standing taller and the whole hem adjusted.

I did not stop cleaning. The tower still called to me at dusk like a stern aunt with a good heart. I kept to my shifts because money does not care how recently your face has been on a screen. The twenty-sixth floor continued to collect fingerprints and coffee circles and stray paperclips like a girl collects bracelets. Mr. Pham’s stapler maintained its stubborn tilt. Ms. Thu’s braid maintained its sovereign length. I pushed my mop like a woman rowing in waters she knows by memory and listened to the morning radio whisper recipes to me through static as if we were the only two awake in a sleeping city that pretended to need sleep and did not.

On a Tuesday that smelled like rain but did not deliver it, a message arrived from the Network with polite teeth. “Mid-Autumn Special,” it purred. “A celebration of moon and memory.” They wanted me to make a mooncake on camera and tell a story that could be cut to fit a sponsor’s patience; they wanted my aunt if she could sit and look like wisdom; they wanted lanterns if we had them, and if we did not, they would arrive with paper and battery and a team of young men to hang festivals from our ceiling. I looked at the email while Auntie tapped the radio to make the singer sound less like he was singing into water and more like he was singing to women who had stopped scaling fish just to listen. Mooncakes were not our daily bread. They were luxuries and obligations, symbols masquerading as dessert, more paperwork than pastry if you asked me at the wrong hour. But the idea made something shift in me, that old stubbornness that Auntie named a cake’s refusal to fall. I wrote back “yes” and then went to count our strengths: a dented pot, a charmed oven, a table with scars, a pair of hands that had spent their lives learning when to stop.

Mid-Autumn has a way of making the city feel like a fair for children and a test for adults. In the market, strings of star-shaped lanterns trembled like shy fish. Men in doorways folded cardboard moons with practiced wrists. The candied fruit vendors showed off their oranges and persimmons like proof that patience can be sweet. I went to Lien to ask for lotus seeds and she had already set aside two kilos in a bag that she had written on with flour, because pen ink never tells the truth at her stall. “Like stones now,” she said, hefting the bag, “like clouds later if you listen to them.” I told her about the special and she nodded without surprise, as if my life had been walking in that direction for a long time and had finally arrived at the right lane.

At home, I soaked the lotus seeds, boiled them until they sighed. I cooled them and peeled them the way I used to peel mandarins in school, careful not to tear, every white eye revealed clean and blind. I drew out the green germ from the center with a toothpick as if plucking a bad dream by its stem. Auntie sat on the cot and told me how once, when she was fourteen and her brother had borrowed her best shirt without asking, she stole a lotus seed from a temple offering and ate it raw and felt certain the gods would send a storm to make an example of her and yet the sun shone all day and she came to understand something uncomfortable about punishment and its timing. The radio scratched its way through a song about reunion, and a neighbor’s kettle screamed and was forgiven.

I made the golden syrup the way an old woman counts prayers—without looking at the watch and with an eye on the color. Sugar, water, lemon, and time; I bent my face over the pot to smell for that note between caramel and caution, the moment where the bitter is a gentleman and not a thief. I burned one batch on purpose to remind myself of the edge. Tuan arrived with a bag of molds he had borrowed from a cousin who had once sold mooncakes out of a garage with the confidence of an entrepreneur and the paperwork of a fisherman. We opened the bag like a box of old coins. Peony flowers and fish and the character for double happiness carved in reverse, moons that could press their faces into our dough and leave a history. He sanded a splinter off one with his pocketknife and said, “If it sticks, oil like a mechanic; don’t be polite,” and I laughed because he was right and because laughter is oil too.

We argued the mooncake question: baked skin or snow skin. Traditional or the kind with fridges in their blood. Auntie hated snow skin because she said it felt like biting a baby’s cheek and that should be reserved for babies. I told her that snow skin could carry fresh flavors that might look back and recognize our city. In the end, because stubbornness is a currency in this house and we trade it like we trade salt, we decided to do both. I made lotus paste and black sesame paste and a durian custard that could make a person say a word they do not usually say in front of guests. We salted egg yolks from the egg man, washing them like gold coins, setting them like little suns to dry. We oiled our hands and rolled, pushed, printed. The first baked one came out with a belly like an expectant mother and I tapped it and listened to its soft thud and smelled the syrup singing in its pores and wanted to write it a poem.

We ran out of table space and borrowed the neighbor’s stool and then her daughter. The hem became a small workshop lit by fat luck. The boys passed by and were told not to touch and touched anyway, leaving fingers on the air that made me want to be kinder than I am. Lien came with packages of rice flour sifted three times and gossip sifted twice. The new neighbor with the banana fritters gave me a roll of plastic sheeting with reverence as if it were silk for a wedding dress. We worked until the fan gave up and then kept working anyway, the sweat on our faces as purposeful as varnish. When the first tray of baked mooncakes came out of our whispering oven and looked like a fleet of small golden ships, Auntie clapped softly to herself and then pretended to scratch her thigh and I pretended not to see.

The Network wanted a story and I had one that had baked itself patiently while we measured. On a night in the war when bombs fell like lanterns dropped by clumsy gods, Auntie and her sister had hidden under their table with a plate over their heads because their mother had once said that porcelain could deflect wickedness if you used it as a helmet. They had brought a mooncake with them because it had been bought at noon with a week’s ration of grace and they were not going to let heaven steal everything. They had each taken a bite and chewed in the dark as the world rearranged. “You taste very carefully when you are not certain what will remain,” Auntie said, and I wrote it down and underlined it because the producer would want the cadence and because I wanted to remember the way her voice had turned that sentence into a bridge.

The morning before the shoot, I went to the twenty-sixth floor and the glass showed me a city already fretting about rain. Ms. Thu had been called into a meeting that was going to thread her patience through a small needle; she left me a list that meant “everything.” Mr. Pham’s desk was in order because he had watched me watching him on television and had decided to put on something like a show of responsibility. I went room to room with my caddy and my soft shoes. In the smallest conference room, the one with a leaky air conditioner and a painting that pretended to be concerned about hedges, the ceiling had given up on its commitment to dryness. A brown circle bloomed like a bruise, and a drop fell with a movement as slow as a thought. I put a bin under it with the seriousness of a god. I called maintenance in the tone of a person who has seen floods, and while waiting, I rearranged chairs as if posture could prevent water. When the building men came with their ladders and their noncommittal jokes, I stood back and watched their ease with the screws like a woman who recognizes craft even when it has nothing to do with sugar. I stayed long after my shift had begged me to go because it seemed like disrespect to leave water to teach the carpet a lesson, and when I finally left, my apron smelled like lemons and I liked it.

On my way out, I passed a desk where the screen had been left alive and curious, a habit that makes me itch because screens are mouths that gossip for money. I looked reflexively to see if there was anything that should be closed on a stranger’s behalf and saw words that made my chest misbehave. There was a map of District 3 with rectangles drawn in a color that keeps its voice. There was a document with phrases like “acquisition,” “resettlement,” “pilot” and a line that stepped into my house without knocking: Hem 47-49, redevelopment survey phase. The law firm had been hired by a company whose name felt like a hotel to ensure that people like me would be moved like furniture. My eyes ran ahead of themselves, looking for small mercies: community input, heritage assessment, the word “delay.” I wanted to reach into the screen and pull the sentences apart into letters and scatter them in the alley like upturned rice for birds. Instead I took a breath and memorized. My memory is my camera when my phone is tired and my battery is poor. I walked away with those rectangles behind my eyes and the itch under my skin that comes when you see a wave that has not yet chosen which house to break.

I carried the thought home like contraband. I set the bag down and did not tell Auntie first because I did not know what to do with her eyes. I told Lien, because Lien has the kind of brain that has been practicing for this sort of game since we were small and made contracts written on banana leaves. She listened without speaking and then tapped her fan on her knee like a judge and said, “We will need papers,” the way some people say we will need bread. “Rent receipts, photographs, stories written with names and dates, the monk’s blessing in the ledger, the schoolteacher’s complaint about the noise at Tết, the old woman’s certificate from the district for selling sticky rice legally in 1983. They will measure our rooms; we will measure our lives. If they come with clipboards, we will come with chairs. People who sit do not leave quickly.”

That night, under the amber light that makes our alley look like it is being hugged by honey, we sat the hem down and told them. There was a second where the air melted, then the talk warmed up like a wok. People spoke at once with that particular eloquence of those who have learned to count their goats ten times a day. Anger is an instrument here; it needs tuning. The grandfather with the guitar said words in a tone that made the guitar look brave. The noodle woman swore that she would ladle broth at any man with a tape measure who came without taking off his shoes. The barber husband of our neighbor wanted to shave the developer’s head to make him feel naked. The boy with the ball bounced it softly just to remind us there is a rhythm under fear. We agreed on paper: we would collect our documents, we would make a map too, we would write names in a notebook, we would give our hem a number besides the official one: “We are the alley with the basil pots, the noodle steam, the queen of pandan,” Lien wrote, and I blushed and loved her more than my pride.

The day of the Mid-Autumn shoot, the hem had been swept like a widow with a new broom. The crew came with their lanterns and their good shoes and their jokes about how they should move in. Phuong directed traffic with a pen, tapping here, pointing there, smiling at our basil like this was an audition. The cameraman asked if we could hang lanterns across the alley and we nodded as if he had asked if we could breathe. Tuan strung them with a mechanic’s confidence in knot integrity. The boys were entrusted with the batteries because they were more meticulous than the grown men, who would have wasted half the power turning the lights on in the day to see how bright the night could be. The lanterns were stars lowered to our height. When they switched on and the light vibrating under the paper breathed on us, I felt for a small second like a girl who has been good all year and has been allowed to hold something delicate without being told to wash her hands.

We filmed the making of the cakes like a ritual we could explain, and then we filmed our faces like a ritual we could not. The producer asked me about the moon in our alley and I told her it looked like a coin the city refused to drop. She asked me where my father was and I told her that some men are better at being story than being doorstops and she wrote that down without flinching. She wanted Auntie to hold a lantern and tell a ghost story and Auntie obliged by telling one that took place at noon under a mango tree, because ghosts do not keep people’s hours. The sound man stood under the porticoes and listened to the rain that had changed its mind and stayed away.

We broke for a breath and that was when Auntie’s memory went for a walk. She was standing under the lanterns with her hands full of mooncakes wrapped in plastic for neighbors, her blouse buttoned wrong by one doorway, one bone too prominent, and she turned and looked at me with eyes that had gone elsewhere. She asked me if I knew how to get to the station because her brother would be waiting at the ticket window with an impatience that could outlive him. The crew stepped back, embarrassed to have noses and eyes and jobs. I went to her and took the cakes from her so her hands could be free and I told her, “We already came back,” which seemed kinder than telling her she had already gone. She frowned and put a finger to her lips as if to hush a cricket and then she smiled slowly and said, “If I have cake in my hands, I am not lost,” and I repeated it into the camera later and they wrote it into their script under the name they give moments that will sell.

The studio wanted us later that week for a live segment like a bridge between cities. The host would stand like a lighthouse and beam at our hem from far away and the sponsor would put their logo in the corner like a sun that has been told to smile. The van did not arrive; a taxi did, driver uninterested in our narrative. We bundled Auntie in, with Lien and Tuan flanking like bookends. The ride was a study in Saigon’s peculiar ballet; there were moments when the cars agreed to share the road like cousins, moments when elbows were thrown, moments when a woman’s patience allowed a scooter to slip into a space that physics would have denied and the scooter made the physics meet its mother. We arrived shaken and unsplit.

The live segment was a parade with a stopwatch. They miked me up and told me not to touch the wire even if it tickled my imagination. The host said my name correctly without being prompted and I felt both gratitude and suspicion, because I am that kind of person who thank-yous a gift and then holds it to the light to see if it casts a shadow. We put our mooncakes on a stand and they gleamed as if brushed with luck. The sponsor’s representative held one up like an offering and pronounced it acceptable to the gods. I was asked to give advice to people at home and I said, “Do not measure with your fear; use a cup,” and someone in the control room either laughed or sighed in a way that affected the sound.

After, in the corridor where coffee cups go to learn about fate, a woman in a white blouse with a press pass around her neck cornered me gently. She introduced herself with a name that did not sit down. “What is your next step?” she asked, tablet poised, smile set to soothing. “Sometimes steps are stairs,” I said, and she smiled wider and asked if the hem would become a brand and if I would sell online and if I would have a logo. I thought about drawings, about triangles and their sharpness, about squares and their safe corners. I told her, “We will bake and we will clean and we will make a list for the developer,” and she looked at me as if I had given her a turn she could not make on her scooter. She wrote anyway and I blessed her pen.

Back home, we began our campaign like people beginning a festival. Lien brought a ledger with the cover laminated to withstand weather and boiled tea. We went door to door, not with our hands out but with our notebooks open. We wrote names and dates and the stories that come with numbers like shadows come with trees. The old woman who had sold sticky rice near the market since the year after I was born produced a receipt stamped by a man whose stamp had outlived his temper. The carpenter who lived at the mouth of the hem showed us a photograph from 1989 where the alley was younger and the basil pots were milk crates and you could still see the sky with both eyes. The boy with the ball told us he had learned to walk by following the lines in the concrete because the cracks made a map and that must mean the city loved him. We wrote it all and then wrote the addresses of the offices where such words could be filed and then wrote the names of the officials whom the noodle woman had fed broth without chili for ten years and who would take her call.

There were nights when I woke and saw the rectangles of the developer’s plan in the dark on the ceiling and put my hand up to confuse them. There were mornings when the plans dissolved like sugar and left only the sweet determination of women who are going to make bureaucrats eat cake. The tower felt taller when I pushed my trolley, or perhaps I had become braver and that is how height works. In the lobby, Anh Minh showed me his new thermos and told me about his daughter’s teacher who had been transferred because the school needed her to be kind somewhere else. He was not a man given to metaphor and so I wrote it down in my head as a way to remember that kindness is a deployment.

We opened our kitchen on Saturdays as if it had always been a tiny bakery and we had only just remembered. We put a plank on two stools outside the door and laid out our squares and moons. We wrote prices on a piece of cardboard and then crossed them out and wrote different ones because wandering money has to be coaxed. People came from our hem and from the next and from the one after that. They came with curiosity and loyalty, with hands that had washed laundry and lifted paint buckets and clicked keyboards until they forgot their passwords. Some came because they wanted to see if television added flavor and left with their own tongues surprised. The new neighbor’s children ate snow skin mooncakes with noses polite and then asked for another. A woman with a hat big enough to shade her sins bought a tray because her niece had the kind of friends who took photographs of anything that held still. A man from the building down the avenue stopped in his suit and blocked the alley like a van and bought one and pronounced it “fine,” which is the sort of compliment you take to mean “I have never tasted anything my mother did not sign,” and we nodded and put his money under the altar for a second to make it smell right.

Between sales I cleaned. Cleaning is how I tell my bones to behave. I wrung rags and the water turned its usual honest gray. I stacked plates in a way that made them look like they had been born to nest. I scrubbed the corner where sugar tends to leap because sugar is a liar. I wiped the basil leaves with a damp cloth as if they were upholsteries, and the plants forgave me. When the last customer left and the alley exhaled and we counted the money the way you count a child’s breaths when she sleeps, I looked at Auntie and she looked like she had just stolen a lotus seed from a god and gotten away with it.

On a morning when the wind took pity on us, Auntie told me a story I knew by heart and then she tripped and fell into a new sentence. She spoke my mother’s name with a tenderness she reserves for people who are both tragic and useful. She said my mother had never been a good seller because she gave things away when she thought a customer’s sorrow was heavier than his coin. She said my father had come to the sticky rice stall and stood too long and did not buy and then bought too much and then came back the next day because he had read a poem somewhere that told him to repeat mistakes that tasted like sugar. She said she had told them both what to do and they had listened until one day they did not. Then she said, “Your mother did not like her own name, so I gave her mine and kept you,” and for a second the air dipped.

I sat with her in the old light and tried to put her sentence into my mouth to see if it fit. “You gave her your name,” I repeated, and she nodded, her eyes clear in a way that would soon be expensive again. “She wore it better,” Auntie said, with the generosity of old queens. “People call me aunt, it makes them comfortable. Mother is a heavy spoon. I gave it to her to hold and then she put it down.” She sipped her tea with the deliberate pleasure of someone who has refused a quarrel. I did not ask the questions that came like motorbikes from two directions. I looked at our altar with its photograph of two girls who would later forget their exact ages and thought about names like aprons: how sometimes you wear the one that fits, sometimes the one that carries pockets.

I put that story under my pillow like a folded letter. It made the night both softer and more crowded. In the morning, I woke and laced my shoes and cleaned the sink and measured sugar. The habit of work is a bridge across a river of revelations, and I walked it with my basket of rags and recipes. I went to the tower and the elevator chimed like a flute and someone had spilled something that looked like dessert and was a legal document. I wiped it and put the paper back in a pile with its brothers, and for a moment felt a scorn that did not belong on my face. Then I remembered who I am and I smoothed the edges and aligned them and thought of corners safe.

At the district office, our papers became men. Lien wore her serious blouse and her tiger eyes and we smiled with all our teeth. We presented our ledger and our photographs and our words. The clerk behind the glass had a face that had practiced not responding for years and was almost perfect at it. He took our papers and stamped them as if stamps should be used sparingly. He told us nothing except the date we could expect nothing to happen. On the steps outside, we ran into the woman from the white blouse and the careful tablet, and she lifted her eyebrows like a curtain and asked us what we were filing. “Recipes,” Lien said, without opening her mouth too wide. “For making alleys.”

At night, I dreamed about moving our door like a stage flat. I dreamed that the basil pots followed us like obedient dogs. I dreamed that our oven refused to leave and their men with their straps and gloves tried to carry it and it bit them, and they apologized to it and asked it to teach them something. I woke with my cheek stuck to the table and Auntie’s soft snore telling me that time still happened in the room and not only on screens. I made ginger tea and we shared it and watched the first light walk down the sides of the glass tower, stretching like a cat that has forgiven us for forgetting its dinner.

The baking did not become easier. It became heavier with knowing who would eat. I made a batch of mooncakes and when the syrup went one shade too dark, I threw it out because the moon does not accept compromises made to enemies. I made steamed layers of bánh da lợn because I wanted to see green and yellow kiss again, because some days memory does not need to be sharp, it needs to be a blanket. I baked sponge and let it collapse once out of sheer perversity and swore softly in a way that would have made the sponsor’s man clutch his pearls. I cleaned and the corners gleamed and I felt the relief that comes from making small surfaces behave when nothing else promises to.

A week after the live segment, a young man in a pale shirt with a tie that looked underfed came to the hem with a clipboard and a respectful smile. He said he was from the company with the hotel name. He asked if he could “engage,” and we said he could sit. He took notes as if information might float out of the air if he were quiet. He admired the basil and the roster of sales for our Saturday pop-up as if applause might make our case. He told us about compensation packages as if he were offering us a holiday in colder weather. We poured him tea and gave him a mooncake with a filling of durian and watched his face make the expression of a person who discovers his own convictions are too narrow for his body. He did not wipe his mouth on his tie and this made me forgive him more than I expected. When he left, he said, “I am not the river. I am a cup,” and I believed him because cups can be filled with different things if the hand is friendly.

We began to draw our hem on paper with pencils that did not take orders from anybody. We made the stairwell exactly as narrow as it is so that officials would have to squint and therefore begin to understand. We placed the noodle stall where it actually lives, not where a planner might put it, because planners prefer neatness and soup tells a different story. We marked the basil pots in squares like small parks because to us that is what they are: green spaces where conversation gets shade. I drew my door the color of old jade and Lien shaded it the color of perseverance. We labeled things in two languages because we live in two at least. We made a small legend for those who require a legend to comprehend a castle.

Between all this drawing and filing and cooking and mopping, life did what life does and insisted on being itself. The neighbor’s new baby learned to clap and used it on everything, including the kettle and my face. The sourdough boy from the show messaged me a photograph of a boule he had scored with a map of the Saigon River and I messaged back a photograph of our alley drawn on a piece of rice paper and we agreed that dough remembers hands. The District 7 man opened a second shop and sent me a box as fat as his confidence and I ate one tart and saved the rest for the hem and found that generosity tastes better when shared even if the tart’s pastry is deceitful. The influencer girl liked one of my posts and my phone lit up like a lantern and I turned it face down because I prefer lanterns I can blow out with my mouth.

On a Sunday evening, I walked with Auntie to the river because sometimes I forget that water exists for free in this city. We stood at the railing with all the other people who realize the same thing at the same time and watched the boats drag their lights along like stories you do not want to tell yet. The river did its business of carrying and not returning, the way rivers are employed. Auntie told me to be careful of men who use phrases like “legacy” when they are not old enough to deserve the word. I asked her how old is old enough and she said, “Older than now,” which was not helpful and extremely accurate. We ate a grilled corn cob and the vendor sprayed a mixture of butter and scallion that would make Paris weep with apology, and when the smoke got into my hair, I rejoiced because smoke in hair is how you know you exist in a place and not just a program.

When we returned to the hem, Phuong was waiting with her clipboard lowered like a woman at a shrine. She had come without the van and without lanterns and without pens on purpose. “We are doing a small piece on places that should not be moved by men with rulers,” she said without coaxing. “It is not for the sponsor; it is for us.” She looked at Auntie and then at me and then at the basil, and I wanted to kiss her wrist the way you kiss a baby’s to make it laugh. We let her sit and we told her small things because small things are the ones that fit through the heart’s doors. She wrote gently and asked us no questions we could not answer without changing the subject.

After she left, the hem exhaled with the relief of having been listened to by someone who does not need to buy us. The night grew itself like a plant. The lanterns sagged in the damp like old actresses and I loved them more for it. We stacked the stools and my back told me what it thought. Auntie sat and cleaned pandan leaves in case tomorrow forgot how to smell. The fan squeaked and apologized for being itself. I stood at the sink and ran the rag over the wood and watched the dark water circle the drain and thought of how circular things are soothing: the moon, the rim of a bowl, the loop of a friend’s advice, the ways in which the radio says “don’t panic” and I answer without saying it and then say it out loud and then put it into my cake like a leavening.

There were letters after that, and rumors, and a fragment of a promise that would come in the form of a meeting with a man whose hair had been taught to behave by a bottle. There were customers who came and said, “I saw you,” as if seeing were something you could fold and put in your pocket for later. There were mornings I could afford the more expensive coconut milk and nights I could not afford to think too far into the next week. There was a woman who came and asked me to make a cake for her mother’s altar and I cut squares and wrapped them in banana leaf and put my name, properly, on the little note and told her not to offer triangles because they cut luck, and she nodded and I watched her walk away carrying something square and safe. There was a day when the oven decided to remember the steam and gave me trouble and I turned to the pot and lit the flame without anger and told the camera inside my skull, “This is not a failure; this is a language,” and my hands obeyed.

Another message arrived from the Network inviting me to a meeting about a show that wanted to travel alleys and kitchens and make aunties into maps. I agreed for the sake of curiosity and also for the sake of the basil. I am learning to count my yeses like recipes, measured, sifted, allowed to rest before baking. I went to the office with the glass and the very polite chairs and the feeling of having brushed my hair with someone else’s comb and sat across from people whose smiles were as expensive as their pens. They said words like “platform” and “reach” and “leverage” that make me think of people trying to pry a coconut open with their teeth. I said words like “time” and “kneading” and “gas bill” which are not abstract and therefore do not look good on a whiteboard. We ended with nothing decided and everything possible, and I went home and told Auntie what they had said and she told me to buy fish sauce before the price moved again and I did as I was told because that is what you do with orders that taste like home.

In the quiet that followed the noise of possibility, I cleaned and baked and counted out change into hands that had sand under the nails and lotion in the fingerprints. I practiced gratitude until it was not a performance. I kept a notebook of words the hem used for certain things that the city names differently, so that when the developer called the cracks in the pavement “hazardous,” I could show a page where Lien had written “reservoirs for rain for children’s boats.” I wrote down the way Auntie says “my” when she means me and the way she says “my” when she means “belonging,” and I realized those words have been sharing a house for a long time.

On a day that had the decency to rain when the sky said it would, the law firm on the twenty-sixth floor held a meeting about their client’s timeline and afterwards left a stack of paper cups with a different logo than last week, and I noticed because I notice things that show money moving. I filled the dishwasher and listened to its small ocean. I caught my face in the window and saw a woman whose eyes had become a little more deliberate. I pressed the elevator button and thought about how many buttons must be pressed for a city to change. I went down to the lobby and Anh Minh held up a mango still warm from his wife’s hands and I took it with the respect owed to a small sun. I put it in my tote next to the rag and the pandan and the ledger, and walked into the heat, which had waited for me like a familiar dog, and I did not panic because panic is a luxury our hem does not keep on its shelf. I went home to the basil pots and the boys and the women and the men and the cat who sneaks in and the fan that complains and the oven that forgives and the woman who sometimes becomes my mother in the middle of a sentence and I fed them all with the only answer I have ever learned that counts as both prayer and argument.Chapter 8

The morning the ceiling fan learned a new stutter, the air had already made up its mind to be a wet shirt. I woke to the sound of the electricity deciding we were not worth its effort, the click from the meter like a tongue tired of scolding, and lay in the short quiet that follows when every appliance in a room is reminded of its mortality. Auntie was awake and counting on her fingers, the old trick she uses to make time sit. She had slept with a pandan leaf pressed in her pillowcase and when she lifted her head it fell into her lap and she smoothed it with the same gravity she once reserved for my hair on the first day of school. I boiled water on the gas and watched the flame hold steady because the flame does not concern itself with invoices, and we shared ginger tea warm as breath and waited for the city to wind itself back up.

The phone rang with the insistence of a toddler, half apology, half demand. It was a number with the district code I had learned to hate in the last few weeks, and I let it ring twice more so my fear could run to the door and compose itself. A woman introduced herself in the tone of someone who has said her name into a thousand rooms where chairs scrape for the same reasons. She was from the committee that makes decisions about things they have not slept beside. There would be a “consultation,” she said, and she stretched the word the way a seamstress stretches fabric to see if it will give. We were to come on Thursday morning in clean clothes and polite shoes and bring our papers and our patience. “We have lanterns,” I said, because I am not always as good at words as cake, and she pretended she had not heard and told me the address I had walked past a thousand times without seeing because it belonged to someone else’s map.

I went to the tower because the electricity there never fails without first notifying finance. The lobby smelled like lilies and a weather report. Anh Minh had shaved close and looked like a man who had been told that dignity would be inspected at ten. He tipped his helmet anyway and asked after Auntie in a voice that had learned the slope of her name, and I said she was combing her hair like a soldier polishes his boots. On the twenty-sixth floor someone had left an architectural model under a plastic dome in the long conference room that pretends to be international. It sat like a cake you are not allowed to cut: clean white blocks arranged on green, small trees the color of money planted in circles that would never see mud. It was labeled with letters that were proud of themselves. There was a ribbon of blue for the river, obedient as a line of ink; there were gray rectangles for parking, because even the future needs to store its vehicles somewhere; there was a rectangle where our hem should be and instead there was something called a “community green.” I stood with my rag in my hand and imagined a row of basil pots translated into brochures and a woman with a headset explaining to a camera that “authenticity initiatives” would ensure our spirit survived in the cracks between tiles. I pushed the rag into the corner of the table until the wood knew it was not alone and then I moved on, because the dishwasher was sighing and that meant it was time to feed it.

By the printer, the young man with the tie that looked underfed passed me and then backed up as if his conscience had tugged his sleeve. He asked if I had seen the model, as if it could have hidden from me by ducking under the chairs. I told him I had read enough letters for one lifetime and he smiled in the way that admits to burnt fingers. He said he had a grandmother in Tan Binh who still kept her rainwater in ceramic jars because she trusted clay more than pipes, and that he could not get his colleagues to understand the weight of a staircase. “They have only ever climbed solutions,” he said, and then flushed because solutions are dangerous words around women who have capitals in their kitchens. I asked him if he could find me the date of the hearing where they would bring their engineers to explain why our doors do not comply with the future, and he said yes but his voice wore the shirt of maybe. He left and I watched his shoulder blades under his thin cotton, the way a boy’s hope shows itself before his life teaches it tricks.

At the market, the day pretended to be generous and then made me argue for every discount. Lien had set aside lotus seeds for people who arrived with gift boxes from their sisters-in-law and she slipped me a scoop of the small ones that cook faster and told me that patience is not just a virtue, it is a recipe. We built a stack of petitions like a wedding cake, each page with names that looked like cousins when written close. The egg man was keeping my yolks lush and his receipt book tidy because he had decided he enjoyed writing my name correctly; he said “My” and then “My” again, the belonging and the girl, and the sound braided itself into a rope I could climb if I needed to. The noodle woman promised to bring her short stool to the meeting because a short stool makes any long speech look silly, and I asked her to bring the long spoon as well because we are women who like options.

In the afternoon, while Auntie was humming to the radio like she could correct its pitch with her mouth alone, she told me she would go fetch green mango from the woman with the forearms that look like kneaded dough. I said wait and put rice to soak and when I turned back she was already at the door, shoes in her hand like children who have misbehaved and asked to be carried. I followed her with the kind of alacrity that reveals itself only after misfortune has been auditioned and cast, but she was quick in the way the old get quick when the room changes shape. By the time I reached the mouth of the hem she was not in the first ring of stalls, and then she was not in the second, and then she was not in any ring and my stomach became a bowl turned upside down with nothing under it. Lien looked up from a papaya and saw my face and did that thing where her eyes move before her body. The boys let their ball go to the ditch and tore themselves into two to cover more corners. The basil pots looked like hats too formal for a rescue, and I breathed the way the radio tells me to when cakes decide they will not rise out of respect for recipes.

We found her near the bus stop that imagines itself a seaside bench, standing with her coins in her palm and her mouth set in the concentration of someone trying to remember a song in the wrong key. The woman who sells lottery tickets had drawn a circle around her with her body and her voice, and was telling her, “Sit, aunt, sit,” and Auntie replied, “I am not aunt, I am a girl late for something,” and the lottery woman said, “We are all late and all girls,” and I loved her for the kind stupidity of the statement. I took Auntie’s coins and put them back in her pocket and combed her hair with my fingers and told her the green mango had decided to be ripe elsewhere. She looked at me, the recognition pulling at her features as if it had to climb something in order to arrive, and then she smiled like someone who has finally pronounced a long word correctly.

Back home, she sat and let me wash her feet and said, with sudden authority, that we would need to take the red string down from the door and move it to the kitchen because luck had gotten confused. We did, obedient as the newly converted, and I held her ankles and felt the unspokenness in the bone. I wanted to call Lien and Tuan and tell them that I had lost and found something in one minute and would need the rest of my life to pay back the debt, but instead I went to the stove and made her sweet soup with the jackfruit seeds that glisten like polished wood, because sometimes the only currency that works is hot sugar.

The Network wrote again on paper that thought it had charm. They wanted to send us to Hanoi to film bánh cốm in a street where old women still fold green rice with patience like weather, and they wanted to put me in front of a temple and ask where the center of my city is, and they wanted a shot of me on the train as if trains could carry a person where a body like mine most needs to go. I sat with the letter and tried to persuade my heart that it was not a bad person for wanting, and then I looked at Auntie’s hair pins and thought of the district office and the precise way the clerk had stamped our papers without looking, and I wrote back that my hem had a meeting with its survival and my aunt had a meeting with her name and I could not take the train to a place where the rice has learned different mistakes. The producer wrote back a line that made me laugh, “We will keep the light on,” and I folded it into the ledger between the noodle woman’s debt for last week’s mooncakes and the egg man’s careful numerals.

We organized the petition day as if we were arranging a friend’s wedding, and the hem dressed up without saying that was what it was doing. The carpenter lent us his chalk for the banner and Tuan printed flyers at his cousin’s shop with an ink that smelled like mornings in high school. The boys offered to be runners without anyone asking them, and I wrote their names down because names are how you keep boys tall. I baked trays of small squares of pandan sponge and covered them with banana leaves damp as breath and wrote in pen on cardboard—take one, sign here—and when I ran out of pen I stared at my city and thought about the way pens migrate to men in shirts with pockets as if pockets deserve them. Lien arrived with pomelos because round fruit is insurance, and we tied red threads to the basil and treated the pots like dignitaries who had finally agreed to speak.

A man from the ward came in his light blue shirt and the walk of someone who has learned to hold a file like a shield. He had a smile not built for alleys, too careful, too measured, and he stood beside the basil and told us about procedures as if he were reading instructions for cooking a fish with a secret. We nodded because nodding is sometimes a weapon. He did not sit until the noodle woman shoved the short stool under his knees, and then he sat and the speech became less of a wall and more of a fence we could lean on. He tasted a cake square because he could not avoid it without making our mothers rise up from their altars, and when he chewed I watched the muscles under his cheeks negotiate with his training. He said, “It tastes like my aunt’s hand,” and it was the most dangerous thing he said that day, because it betrayed that he still had a woman in his body who had taught him patience. He left with petitions and the faint air of a man who might make a phone call at night with the bathroom door closed.

That evening, the sky remembered how to open. The rain came with the suddenness of a joke that has waited too long, and the alley became a river not as obedient as the ones in models. Basil pots rose on their bricks like boats. The water took the chalk from our petition chalkboard and smeared it into a watercolor of our names. We put a plank between two stools and watched boys practice a balance that will save them later. Tuan parked his motorbike like a shepherd, making sure each neighbor’s machine had its nose uphill. The cat found the highest stair and practiced the gaze of someone who has never been wet. I steamed a sponge because the electricity had decided again that it had done enough for one day, and the camera inside me recorded everything the way you do when you are trying to remember where to put your anger in case you need it next week.

The next morning, men with tape measures arrived in shirts that looked like apologies. They had the politeness of professional bad news. They asked if they could map the hem for safety and we said yes because saying no is useful only when the room will echo. We put chairs in front of our doors and sat with legs arranged in the confidence of people who know where the cold travels. The noodle woman ladled broth into cups as if soup were language. The carpenter offered them a pencil sharper than their conversation. They measured from the basil to the step and from the step to the drain and from the drain to the place where the boys chalk dragons, and Lien wrote every number down on our own paper with a satisfaction that made me consider kissing her forehead. When one of their men crouched to take a photograph at the height of a small child’s eye, I thought perhaps we had this one, and then he stood and closed his camera and his face returned to the neutral of people whose hands are employed by other people’s decisions.

Auntie had her fall on a Wednesday when I thought I could trust the day because the sky had chosen a blue with enough clouds to look honest. She was rinse-washing a handful of rice as if the rice had offended her, and when I turned to lift the pot she forgot how to tell her feet about the edge and sat down on the floor in a way the floor resented. She did not cry out, and that was more frightening than the cry. Her mouth went soft on one side as if the word she was about to say had been pulled away by someone who did not have the right. I called Tuan with a voice I reserve for phone calls that make people run, and he ran, and the motorbike learned to be gentle, and we tacked ourselves to the hospital like paper to the board in the district office. The emergency room had the smell of purpose and surrender; there was the usual ocean of bodies, the usual argument between money and mercy, the usual fan that would have liked to do more.

The young doctor with hair not yet taught to behave by night shifts looked at her eyes with light and asked me questions that require small movements to answer and I answered big because I was afraid. He said it was small, he said it was a warning, he said words like “transient,” which is what you call sorrow when you need to leave the room, and he wrote us a list of pills that all had names like cousins you do not trust. He asked me if there was someone at home who could sit with her always and I looked at my palms and thought they did not look big enough. He asked about our stair and our bathroom and I told him about the basil and our plank and he did not laugh because he was a serious boy.

You learn a new city when you sit in a hospital. It is made of chairs that have learned to carry time, of women who can fall asleep upright, of men whose legs remember how not to cry. The hem came to us in shifts, not wanting to crowd the corridor and then crowding it anyway because affection in this place does not respect rules written on white boards. The noodle woman sent congee in a thermos older than our alley’s current name. The barber brought a small fan that clipped to a bed rail and looked like a plastic flower. The lottery seller came and pressed a ticket into my hand and told me to scratch it with my thumbnail, and when I did and we did not win, she nodded as if the universe had walked past our doorway and decided, mercifully, not to knock. Lien took the ledger and made it produce lists that obeyed her and made sure I ate the piece of pomelo she shoved at my mouth while I pretended to forget my own body to honor someone else’s, because friendship can be a lecture and I accept the tuition.

In the middle of the second night, when the lights made everything look like bad theater and the nurse’s plastic shoes clicked like insects, Auntie woke and told me that my mother had sent word that she was coming by train. She insisted we get to the station and I told her that the station was sleeping and she said sleep is for people who plan ahead, and I decided it was better to get her to the end of the corridor than to argue with a city of ghosts. We stood and walked, her hand in mine, mine in the railing’s, and we passed doors where babies were learning to breathe and old women were learning to sleep and men were learning to be tender under fluorescent tubes. We found the window at the end where the city had puddled its lights in the glass and we stood and let the trains in our heads pass. She put her forehead on the window the way girls do when they imagine themselves in movies, and I stood behind her and wished for her that we had time to take all the trains we wanted to.

When we came home, it felt like we had been away a month and the basil had learned a new trick, but it was only that Tuan had moved them to catch morning light and now they looked like small generals conducting a tour. The hem had swept itself three times. The boys had lined up their flip-flops against the wall in the confidence of soldiers. The neighbor had stuck a note in the door slit with a heart that looked like two rice grains leaning, and inside it said, “We boiled ginger. Knock.” The oven had not been used by anyone and I loved it for its patience. Auntie sat on the cot like a woman on a boat and I folded the corners of the sheet into squares because I am who I am.

At the tower, my shifts shifted around me because Ms. Thu had a heart under her braid after all, even if she prefers to keep it in a drawer. She told me to come late and leave early, and then, in a theater of impatience, told me not to expect special treatment. Mr. Pham, whose stapler remains an object of anthropological study, looked at me over his glasses and told me that his mother keeps a shrine to Quan Âm with a bowl of water so still you can see your choices in it, and then he squared his papers an extra time to show me that he could be gentle. The young man with the underfed tie slipped me a photocopy of a schedule with the whisper of someone sliding a pastry into a bag they did not pay enough for; the hearing would be in two weeks, the agenda was long, our item was near the end as if patience could starve us in the hall.

On the Saturday after the hospital taught me to count again, we made square cakes for the nurses and wrapped them in banana leaf and tied them with red thread because if you offer sweetness to people who spend their days restraining blood and patience you must give them something to untie. I carried them on the bus like a firstborn and the bus carried me like a woman who had cried recently and might cry again. A nurse with eyes that would freeze a room if she needed to told me she could not accept gifts and then she accepted and told me to put them on the third desk where the pen always goes missing, and I did and thanked her as if she had let me borrow her name.

We prepared for the hearing the way we prepare a new recipe: we tried it on ourselves first, then fed it to friends who could tell us without lying. Lien coached us in a meeting voice, lower, rounder, a voice that pretends to have slept. The barber practiced the sentence where he would promote a shave and a song as heritage. The lottery woman rehearsed the way she would say “probability” and make it sound like a person she had once dated. The noodle woman tried not to swear in ways that would make her husband point to the altar. I made sample boxes labeled corners safe, corners safe, corners safe, and even though the clerk would say this was not relevant to zoning, I wanted him to have something in his hands that would crumble into the part of his shirt where ties go to learn humility.

On the day, we dressed like ourselves if ourselves had been told we would meet our younger selves in three hours. The room was gray and cool and smelled like men who do not sneeze in public. The panel sat far away as if the distance were designed to make our requests sound like gossip. The projector flickered the way it always flickers in rooms where decisions resist light. We sat on our stools because chairs with backs feel like bribes. They heard about drainage from a man who had never stood ankle-deep in love. They heard about traffic from a man whose motorbike looks like he never needed to get home quickly. Then they heard about us. Lien stood and the room changed because rooms know when they are being asked to behave. She spoke of addresses and dates because that was the language they claim to speak, and then she told them about basil and a cat that ignores water and the way women here can carry two baskets and count change with their toes and never drop a curse in front of a child. She did not cry because crying is a tool and she saves it for when it pays doubles. The noodle woman went up and put the short stool in front of the table and put her elbows on her knees as if she were about to negotiate a better price for the world. She offered them soup in the small paper cups we had bought because dignity can be poured. One of the men took a sip and then remembered himself and put it down and I watched his hand find the cup again when his mouth forgot the script. I spoke last because I wanted to rearrange the air other people left behind. I told them that we had put our names on paper and on walls and in cakes, and that you can move a pot of basil and it will live if you talk to it daily but it will not forgive you if you cut its roots and plant it in a place where the rain is different. I told them we clean offices that make plans and then we come home and clean the corners of our doors so luck can sit comfortably. I told them squares stack. I smiled and met no one’s eyes and at the end I bowed without bending because posture is not only spine.

They did not decide anything in front of us because this city does not like to commit under lights. They thanked us for “engaging,” which is what they call the process of letting people you do not know hold your day’s mood in their hands. The young man with the underfed tie stood at the side of the room and looked like a grandson in a house full of uncles who speak louder than his respect. He did not wave because waving is for later, but he pressed the side of his pen to the edge of the table and it made a sound like a drum and I took that as a small private anthem.

After, we went home with our papers lighter and our bodies heavier. We did not pretend victory because victory does not like alleys anyway; it prefers stages with microphones that smell of spit. We did what we always do when a day has run our tongues raw; we fed each other. I made a pot of cassava cake, chè khoai mì, with coconut that gleamed like secrets, because cassava has the decency to be cheap and honest and forgiving. We ate on the step, and the boys re-drew their dragons, and the basil stretched like it had listened in the district hall and chosen to keep weathering. Auntie sat and counted the coins under her breath because numbers are a religion in our house, and then she looked up and said, with authority, that she would like to make bánh da lợn tomorrow and I told her that we would and she said good, as if she had been suspicious of me and had decided to reconcile.

The Network’s letter about Hanoi found us on a day when Auntie remembered all my teachers’ names from primary school and forgot the second half of her own birthday. I wrote them again and told them I would film a segment on green rice if they came to my hem and let the boys hold the boom and gave the noodle woman her own microphone. They wrote back an emoji I cannot describe to my aunt and followed it with actual words that said they would consider the alleys as a studio, and I thought, consider is a good word, it is a chair without a back, and sometimes that is what you want because it makes everyone sit smarter.

I cleaned the twenty-sixth floor as if cleaning could move bricks on a map. I lined up the mugs so their handles all agreed on the same angle because consensus is a small practice for a messy democracy. I wiped the rim of the sink where the legal assistants splash their ambition in the mornings when their hair still remembers gravity. I moved the model half an inch and put a basil leaf on its community green because pettiness is a spice and sometimes recipes demand it. At the elevator, I stood with my cart and watched my face in the bronze panel like a woman looking at one of her children’s school photos and wondering who got in the way of the light. The doors opened and a man with a suit that speaks to people without help stepped in, looked at my cart, looked at my face, and said, unexpectedly, “Your cakes,” and then stopped because perhaps his tongue had betrayed his day. I said, “My corners are safe,” and he smiled without showing his teeth and stepped off at the next floor as if doors obeyed him even when he didn’t ask.

There were calls from numbers that wanted to sell us steel doors at wholesale and numbers that promised to make our petition trend like a hairstyle if we paid in installments. There were messages from cousins of cousins who suddenly remembered our hem because it had been typed on a program and they asked if we still owed them a favor from when they were nine and I stepped on their toe. There were two women in pantsuits who came and took photographs of our basil and did not take off their shoes and we let them because we were tired and because sometimes you conserve your “no” for a day when it will pay more interest. There was the sourdough boy who arrived with a paper bag and a bread with holes like the ones in the honeycomb cake, and we ate it with fish sauce as if we were making a new country right there on the step. There was the District 7 man who sent a bouquet of sugar flowers that did not wilt in the heat and the boys stole one and declared it a triumph of modern times, and I did not lecture them because the lecture has to be saved for the men with measures.

At night, when the hem has learned its quiet again and the radio has run out of wives who catch husbands at the pier, I sit and count. I count the red threads and how many times I have tied them this year. I count the stitches Auntie has placed in my apron with fingers that shake at the same rate as the fan. I count the steps from our door to the district office and then I multiply them by the number of days in which a city can find the kindness to change its mind. I think about trains and bridges and boats and how every image people use for cities has a direction and a weight, and I decide that my favorite metaphor is still a kitchen, because kitchens are where people argue without leaving and where the temperature remembers what is at stake.

In the morning, the first light walks down the glass tower like a cat that has forgiven everyone overnight. The elevator chimes because someone has taught it manners. I pick up the mango at the lobby desk because Anh Minh’s wife believes in suns you can peel. I put it in my tote next to the rag and the ledger and the basil sprig I am inflicting on the model because I cannot help being myself. I go home by way of the market and Lien has a new scarf the color of a ripe lychee and she ties it around my wrist without asking and says, “For luck,” and I say, “Squares are luck,” and she says, “Then you are both,” and we laugh because there is nothing else to do but laugh and clean and bake and keep our corners safe and our names written and our rooms ready for both cameras and rain. And when the radio says, “Don’t panic,” as it always does when the cake in their oven is learning to be itself, I say back, in the tone of a promise and a recipe, “I won’t,” and then, to be honest, because the sugar respects that, “If I do, I will bake it into something we can eat.”Chapter 10

The week after the hospital stitched our nerves with fluorescent thread, the city seemed to agree to speak more softly, as if it had noticed we were listening too hard. Morning came in like an aunt who has learned the art of knocking, and I let it in with my bones already occupied by the day’s list. Auntie was asleep with her mouth open the way the very old and the very young sleep, full of trust in the air. I slid the pandan leaf from her pillowcase and tucked a fresher one in, because routine is a ladder you climb with your eyes closed. The radio woke in the next room on its favorite station and a woman’s voice began to instruct a nation on how to turn mango into a salad that could end an argument. I answered out loud without meaning to, told her she had forgotten about the salt, and felt better because an argument with a radio, unlike most, ends when you want it to.

Phuong’s piece about places that should not be moved aired on a Wednesday night when the rain was hanging about in the mouth of the sky making promises. The hem gathered as if there were a neighbor’s wedding and we had been told there would be karaoke with a microphone so cheap it sounded like a ghost. Someone strung the lanterns back up though they were tired, and the basil wore its red thread like a sash. People brought chairs that remember arguments and heels of bread and one long jackfruit that upset the boys because they do not like fruit that demands knives. We watched the screen bloom with our own walls and pots and shirts. The camera saw things I do not, the way the light comes around the corner and puts its hand on the altar, the way the cat slips under the stool as if it were walking into an old song. The narrator said alley like she had just learned the word and loved it, and Auntie looked at herself and laughed and then covered her mouth with her hand as if a girl had just flirted with her. When Phuong cut to the district map and the rectangles with their hotel name tried to march across our faces, the hem grew quiet and then the doorway filled with a sound like a pot reaching a boil, not angry, exactly, but intent. On the screen, I said that you can move basil if you talk to it every day and the sound man’s shoulders shook as if someone had found the joke in the seam of a prayer. Afterwards, the noodle woman marched into the kitchen and declared that if the developer came to buy broth she would charge him double and then sit him down and teach him how to chew.

The piece did what television sometimes manages when it pretends to be church. People we did not know walked down our alley in the mornings just to see how basil grows in cracked plastic and to confirm we are not a set. They bought a square and took a photograph and asked if they should take off their shoes and I told them yes not because the floor asked for it but because ritual does not cost much and it pays in attention. A girl from another hem came and hugged me as if she owed me money and whispered that her landlord had stopped returning calls and could she sit for a minute and breathe and I said sit and breathe and let the boys show you the trick with the paper boats. The influencer girl floated in with a hat that acted like it belonged in Europe and brought me cookies packaged in a box that made our table blush, and she sat and ate a square with her fingers and took no photographs because the day did not require proof.

There was a day with a meeting where the men with rulers tried to practice their kindness. They did it in our alley because Phuong’s piece had made them understand that some rooms make your manners better and some rooms make them worse. They arrived with tote bags that had printed phrases designed to convince us they were human. They wore shoes that cost more than a week’s curry but took them off at the noodle woman’s bark. The young man with the tie that never eats well came first and looked relieved to find us already sitting like people who do not trust standing. He set down a stack of forms with their corners aligned and looked me in the face in the way of someone who has chosen a team this week. Behind him came a man with hair that held still in a way that indicated he had not ridden a motorbike in years and he nodded to us like a man nods at a family portrait he has not yet decided to hang.

They spread their maps as if laying out a quilt over our table. Lien smiled with all her teeth and put our map next to theirs and they suffered the comparison like men in new shoes asked to walk on wet tiles. The plan had softened its edges since the last time we saw it, a few corners rounded as if compromise were an eraser. There was an innovation: a corridor labeled “heritage passage,” a string of words that looks foolish without soup. The man with the hair explained that we would be invited to remain in a “curated environment” that would “honor existing street culture while improving sanitary outcomes.” The barber coughed a laugh into his hand and the noodle woman dropped her ladle an extra inch so that it clanged and said, “Sanitary outcomes,” as if auditioning the phrase for inclusion in a list of curses. I asked about roofs. I asked about rents. I asked whether the basil would be allowed to sit on any step or only on steps selected by men with clipboards. The man with the hair said they were prepared to “engage in a process,” and I looked at his shoes and imagined them full of river water. The young man with the thin tie watched us watch him, and when he collected the forms I saw he had written in the margins: make the corridor crooked, talk to the basil, leave the steps in uneven heights so boys can practice balance.

Later that week, the camera boy with the gentle silence came to the hem without his moons and boxes. He wore a shirt with a stain like a small country and brought me a bag of duck eggs his mother had made him take as apology for the day he had forgotten to tell me to look left and I had nearly knocked my head against the boom. He asked if he could photograph Auntie’s hands and I told him to ask her the way you ask an older woman to dance: with respect, and a willingness to be refused. She made a face like why would anyone want to keep a picture of a broom, and then she put her hands on the table and let him anyway, and he clicked as if he were trying not to wake something. When he showed me the back of the camera, her veins looked like rivers in a book where rivers are allowed to meander, and I let the breath I had been storing out of my ribs.

We prepared for a small wedding in our hem the way our mothers prepare for rain, with plastic and prayers. The lottery seller’s daughter had chosen a boy who smiled with his eyes first and his teeth second, and the two of them had the good sense to register their love with both the district and their gods. They wanted squares of pandan and a layered bánh da lợn with the green and the yellow pressed together like a prediction that would make old aunties nod, and a top made from steamed mung beans sweetened just enough to make the elders say polite things. The girl asked for a triangle of something to make the table look like an advertisement and the hem inhaled audibly, and she laughed and put her hands up and said she was teasing and I forgave her, because youth is permitted to play with geometry until reality returns its homework. We set up the planks with the confidence of carpenters, the boys ran errands with the ferocity of bees, and the barber hung a red cloth over the doorway so happiness would recognize the address. I steamed the layers under a lid wrapped in cloth so the drops would mind their manners, and the cake rose in patient increments while the radio sang a song about trains, which is perhaps the most foolish thing to put in the air on a day like that.

During the vows the sky changed its mind and sent a brief blessing disguised as trouble. The rain came down with the noise of cousins arriving. We moved tables with the skill of people who have lived near rivers. The bride tucked her skirt into herself and marched across a puddle like a woman who knows the point of shoes is not to keep water out but to show the water who is walking. After, when the cups were stacked and the last pomelo skin put in the correct basket for compost and gossip, the couple lingered under the doorframe like actors reluctant to leave a stage. The lottery woman cried into a towel as if it were a profit margin, and the noodle woman patted her back as if burping a baby truth. We sent them off with squares wrapped in banana leaf, and I pressed two extra into the boy’s hand the way a city presses responsibilities into casual palms. Later, Auntie said that the boy had eyebrows like a trustworthy bridge and that was as good as any blessing I have heard.

The day after the wedding, the tower had a fire drill, which is a practice run for panic. The announcement came over the speakers with a voice that had taken lessons in calm, and I stood with my mop and listened to an imaginary alarm while the legal assistants lined up in their sensible shoes. We walked down twenty-six flights counting flights like reciting a poem none of us felt in our mouths. On the sidewalk, they checked their names off the list with pens that think well of themselves. Ms. Thu looked at her watch the way a general looks at clouds. Mr. Pham took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes as if the building had printed itself there. The young man with the thin tie stood near the curb and watched me watching the smokers step three meters farther away than they are permitted and he said, without greeting, that he had included a clause about leaving space for chairs that are not matching. I told him matching chairs are a hazard in some languages, and he grinned in that small way that shows you a person might yet survive their job. When we climbed back up, the elevator did its charity and I leaned against the wall and felt the groove where hundreds of shoulders have rested, a city’s softest archive.

There was a night when Auntie forgot where the sky goes. She woke while the city was between the hour of drunk men singing in doorways and women turning their rice, and she walked herself to the corridor where we hang laundry that smells like honest work. I found her there with her hand on the line as if she were waiting for a message. She whispered, in the tone one uses at altars, asking the clothespins where they had put my mother. I told her that the pins were rude and do not answer and she nodded, satisfied to have someone to blame. I sat with her on the stool with the leg that threatens and told her about the morning’s orders in the exact order they would happen, because sequence is a rope we can throw to the other side. When she was calm enough to scold me for forgetting to bring in the basil the other night, I exhaled and guided her back inside. Before I put her in bed, I brewed a pot of pandan tea strong enough to perfume sleep and we split it, and she told me without my asking that I was a good girl today and I decided not to ask what measure she was using.

Phuong called to say they wanted to do a pilot for the alley show and the pilot would be my kitchen plus two other women whose laughter could make an electric fan behave. She asked if I would be host or ingredient and I told her I do not like to be one without the other, and she said that was an answer the sponsor would not understand and she would translate. We talked about money as if it were rice: per kilo or per bowl, and whether a heaping bowl was permitted. I told her filming could not be on Thursdays because the clinic had their stroke group and Auntie liked to sit in a room with other women who misplace nouns and laugh about it. Phuong said she loved a woman who put her aunt in her calendar above the camera, and I swallowed the praise like medicine that does not change your life but makes it less interested in biting you. When we hung up, I sat and looked at my apron on its nail, and it looked back like a shirt that has outlived three girls and is considering whether or not it has the stamina for a fourth.

We hosted an “open alley” day that Lien named and then printed on paper with a font that looked like something you would trust to watch your child for an hour. We hung photographs of ourselves on a line with clothespins because there is a particular thrill in seeing your life shiver in the breeze. An anthropology student from the university came with a notebook and wrote down the price of basil in two seasons and the names of our ghosts. A man with a small lapel pin and a large opinion tried to explain community land trusts to the barber and the barber listened and then asked the man who cuts his hair. The young man with the tie arrived without his uniform and brought his grandmother from Tan Binh, the one with the jars, and she taught us a way of softening rice paper I had never learned because my life went in a different lane. I made squares until my arm trembled and did not pretend my arm did not tremble because people know the difference between a woman and a commercial. Phuong’s cameraman came by with no camera and bought two squares and ate them standing like a man eating at a bus stop in a city he cannot leave and thanked me with a nod that made something untie itself in my chest.

There was a morning when the electricity and the water decided to take turns irritating us like brothers. The fan sputtered, sighed, and sulked, the gas burned stubborn and blue, the tap dribbled its apology. I considered moving to a jungle where everything makes its needs simple. Then the door banged and Tuan stumbled in holding a car part like a fish he had rescued, and he put it on my table and told me it was a valve and then laughed without mirth because he had used the word “valve” at the district meeting and the man had blinked at him like a fish, and now he was going to fix the valve and it would not blink and therefore his day would end with one thing obeying. He held the car part to his ear like a doctor and listened to its excuses. I set a bowl of noodles in front of him and he ate with the pleasure of a person who knows how to translate hunger into work. Before he left, he took down my apron and sewed the pocket that had begun fraying with a stitch you would trust near a cliff.

The young man with the tie came alone one night, late, when men in offices learn how to be sons again. He did not come to negotiate. He came to sit on the step and eat cassava cake and tell me his father used to sell newspapers in District 5 and that sometimes now, when he signs a letter that will make a woman cry, he sees his father’s hand in his and hates himself for an hour and then goes to work because that is how men like him are built. He asked me if I ever hated my oven. I told him my oven is a person in the family who sometimes behaves and sometimes does not, and that we do not hate people who carry our mornings. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and apologized to no one and told me he would change the word “curated” to “kept alive,” and we both knew it was small, but small words change the way larger words walk.

There was a day when we thought the decision had come because a rumor arrives faster than a postman. Lien came running with her scarf loose, the boys carried an extra ball as if this were news that needed company, and the barber almost cut a man’s ear because he was listening to the air. The rumor said cancellation and then it said delay and then it said a pilot program for on-site upgrading with resident-led committees and Lien wrote the words down even as she was rolling her eyes so they would exist somewhere real. We did not believe it. We made tea and sat in the doorway and held the rumor between us like a hot thing and we passed it hand to hand until it cooled. In the afternoon, a letter did come, blue stamp, corner curled, and it said not no and not yes but something like “proceed with caution,” and that was the most honest answer we had heard in months. The hem exhaled like a man coughing after a good laugh. I went to the altar and said nothing, which is a form of prayer, and Auntie came and put her hand on my back in that exact place where all my sentences originate and said, “We still have to boil the water.”

The pilot for the alley show filmed on a day when the heat was polite and the basil looked photogenic, which is not its job but sometimes it does it anyway. Phuong had found two other kitchens with women who speak to flour as if it were a niece. One was a woman in a hem near the railroad who cooked with a wok big enough to bathe a child, and the other was a grandmother by the canal who made duck egg custard in coffee cups. We filmed the three of us talking about time as if time were an ingredient and not a thief, and then we cooked: I steamed a new version of bánh da lợn with a layer of black sesame, the railroad woman did noodles that slapped the wok like hands clapping, the custard grandmother pulled a line of caramel that looked like a road a god might take if he was in a hurry. The host appeared for an hour and made everyone itch and then left, and when he was gone, the set exhaled and we finished the scene where I walk down the alley carrying a tray and every hand finds a square without being told which one is theirs.

After the cameras left, the hem looked larger and then smaller the way a room does after a party. We put the lanterns back in their box, untied the red threads, stacked our stools, and found ourselves alone with the fan and our breaths. Auntie sat with her back to the wall and asked me to list the names of the boys in order of birth, which is a game she plays to see if the day intends to be kind. I did and she smiled and told me I had missed one and I had not and we looked at each other and laughed the way you laugh when you have stepped on a stair you did not expect but did not fall. Late, with the city deciding which lights to put to bed first, I wiped down the table, and the rag made the wood glow and the glow was a kind of encouragement. The radio had learned a new song about a woman with a broom and I felt seen in a way that embarrassed me because I prefer to be noticed by ovens and cats.

We began, because people kept asking us to, to write down our recipes in a form that could be read by someone who has not watched us for years. It was not easy because recipes are spells and you do not hand them to strangers without making them spit and turn around quietly so the spirits do not feel slighted. Lien held the pen as if she were writing a letter to an aunt who lives in a different alphabet. I said, “Beat until the whites hold a soft peak like a grandmother’s shoulder,” and she said, “write two to three minutes with a whisk, longer if your arm worries for the rent,” and we found a tone that felt like me but would keep someone from blaming me when their city made the air heavy. We debated whether to put “speak to batter” as a step and decided to hide it in a parenthesis. We took photographs with Tuan’s phone that made our food look like it thinks very well of itself, and then we took other photographs with the cameraman’s old machine that made our food look like it has survived something and would like to be eaten by a friend.

There were days when the tower’s windows looked like slices of fish, cold and slick, and I had to force my legs to carry the mop bucket as if it were a pail of water drawn from something honest. On those days I thought about the train I did not take to Hanoi and felt no regret and a small one, the kind you fold and put in the pocket of a dress you will wear three times before the season changes. Ms. Thu watched me with the soft disdain she reserves for people whose lives have the nerve to be interesting, and then she told me to go home early and closed the ledger as if mercy had been charged to her account. Mr. Pham left me a tangerine the color of a monastic robe and did not claim it because generosity in men like him fractures if witnessed. The young man with the tie sent a message that said the hearing had been rescheduled for a day when Auntie has her clinic and could we send the barber instead, and I wrote back that the barber would charm them and then make them forget where their pen had gone.

In the market, basil remained a currency not admitted to banks. Eggs continued to be a daily referendum on the quality of my life. The noodle woman’s husband finally learned how to hold the radio to his ear so that the sports announcer’s mouth put fewer irritations into the street. Tuan’s motorbike developed a hiccup that made it sound like a child practicing mischief, and he loved it more for being imperfect. The boys grew half an inch and became for a week impossible to please and then forgave themselves and set to making dragons that could scare the dust away from a corner. The barber’s wife decided to dye her hair the color of ripe longan and we admired her even if we were not certain and when the sun caught it just exactly right we were certain and told her so.

There was a letter from the studio with a signature that had been taught to look like a mountain range. They wanted to consider a season. They wanted me to say “season” on the phone so they could record me saying it and play it back to me in case I forgot my own consent. They wanted a schedule that would let me rest, they said, and I smiled because the only schedule that lets me rest is one written by rain. They wanted me to bring people with me and I told them I would not arrive without Lien and Tuan and Auntie and the basil if someone could find a way to make the pots pass security. They said a pot was a problem and I suggested we meet the problem halfway by calling it a sponsor. Phuong laughed on the line and I imagined the pen in her bun losing its place.

The city is a kind of oven and every day it asks us how brave we are feeling and then gives us a test that seems unrelated. I answer with a mop and a whisk because I am not built for podiums. On the night when lightning practiced scales beyond the river, I sat with Auntie on the step and we ate mango from the security guard’s wife with salt and chili and the air kissed us the way an old friend does when she cannot afford to be surprised anymore. Auntie said she wanted to teach me how to sew a stitch that would not show on the front of a dress, and I told her I wanted to teach her how to bind a book so the pages do not run away, and we looked at each other with the truth that there is not time, and then we began anyway because time respects those who start without its permission. We sewed, plain cotton into plain cotton, and she told me that when she came to this hem the first time with my mother at her elbow and a pot that had belonged to a grandmother we could not picture, she had been certain she would stay only until the war apologized. We laughed because wars do not apologize, but sometimes men in meetings do when you put soup in their hands and ask them to sit.

When I went to bed that night, our ledger lay under my pillow because I am now the kind of woman who sleeps on her documents. I dreamed of a kitchen that stretched like a corridor, and at the far end of it there was a window with glass the color of sugar at the point just before it burns. On the table under the window were squares, not cut yet, and a single knife. Outside, I could hear motorbikes making their opinions known, and a boy counting to ten because someone had told him counting makes fear slower, and the basil nodding its leaves because the night had convinced it all was well enough. I woke with my hand curled at the edge of the bed as if I had been holding something and I looked and saw only air, which is exactly what keeps cakes alive, and I smiled at the ceiling fan that had found a new rhythm, and I said what I always say, to the radio, to the oven, to the basil, to the city, to anyone listening who has a ledger of their own pressed under their pillow: don’t panic. Then I put my feet on the floor, which knows me, and began to bake our day.
