On the day the heat finally thins and the wind from the Ravi carries something like mercy, Murad Awan pins a scrap of cardboard to the wood-shuttered stall he has rented in the back lane off Anarkali Bazaar. The cardboard is cut from an old detergent box. The letters, grudgingly careful, are painted with cheap marker he stole from his step-sister’s pencil case: “Khushboo & Calm. Oils. Blends. Listening.”

He stands under the awning and looks at the sign until he can believe it belongs there. He has washed the floor, scrubbed the black fungus from the wall with vinegar, and nailed a shelf made from a broken bedframe. The doorway is still too low; he has to tilt his head like a supplicant each time he enters. Dust from the bazaar sometimes comes in oily—fried pakora ash, diesel fumes, powder from a tailor’s chalk. It mixes with the first glass bottles he has arranged like short soldiers. Rose. Chandan. Khus. A narrow vial of oud he is a little frightened to open.

He has never kept a place of his own, not really. He has kept motels and cousins’ spare rooms and the inside of a car idling near a curb. He knows the rhythm of the city when you watch it for a living: who lets their dog out at eleven, which bank guard smokes under a neem tree at the exact same minute every day, how a gate looks when it is latched by habit and how it looks when it is latched by fear. He knows the way to step out of sight. He knows where you become a shadow among shadows.

And now he has a shop that smells like basil and old iron.

People keep calling it an attar booth, but he corrects them, gently, like he is rearranging their collars. “Aromatherapy,” he says, and the men with the heavy moustaches, the ones who come from the tyre shops and the meat stalls, smirk.

“Bhai, so you’ll put scent under our noses and make us good?” one says. “Put some under your own first.”

Murad’s palms have thickened with small burns and scars. He holds them open like proof. There is a way of standing he learned from the older men in Mochi Gate: shoulders loose, eyes down but never closed, feet a little apart so you can pivot. “Nothing makes anyone good,” he says. “Scent doesn’t make you good. It only makes you remember you are alive.”

His name floats on the lane in the wrong way. Men who know him nod too deeply. Across the alley, a boy who sells pirated DVDs refuses to meet his eye but keeps glancing at him with a faithful curiosity. He can feel the cloud of his past move ahead of him and behind him, thick as incense smoke, impossible to outrun. They call him killer in two languages, sometimes in three. Qatil. Murderer. The word catches on their teeth because it is a story they have told about him so often they cannot hear its weight.

Once, years ago, in a room with a single tubelight that buzzed like a trapped hornet, he put an end to a man’s breathing. It did not feel like cinema. It felt like a door being shut with the padlock on the other side. He has told himself, facedown on a mattress, that he was made into what he became by the streets, by the men he owes money to, by a father who beat his mother until the neighbors intervened once and then never again. It is true, and also it is wrong. He was made by all of it and also by himself.

He turns the sign so it is a little straighter. He breathes in. Basil, cut wood, a ghost of old pickles from the previous tenant’s jars. He has a small burner for the oils, a clay dish that sits over the flame. There is a box of cotton pads. He is trying to learn words that are soft and do not cut his mouth. Blend. Grounding. Release. He is trying to invent a Murad who can say them.

Zoya pads in around eleven, hair pinned with a cheap butterfly clip, her sandals slapping at the dust. “You spelled ‘calm’ wrong, bhai,” she says, not unkindly. She is seventeen and will be eighteen in what her stepfather calls the blink of a catastrophe. Her handwriting is like metal wire. She could fix radios with those fingers if anyone let her.

“People in this lane can’t spell either,” he says. “They will never know.”

She peeks into the bottles. Her nose does this little flutter at the top, a nervous bird. “Rose is nice,” she says. “It makes me think of Nani when she put oil in my hair and scolded me for chewing thread.”

“That was not rose,” he says. “That was Dabur amla.”

“Same family.” She grins. The light turns her profile into paper-cut angles. She looks like their mother around the eyes and like her own father around the mouth—Shahnaz’s second husband, who left his coat on the back of a chair and never came back for it. “Will you make a lot of money from this, or is it another thing we will have to pretend is a part of your therapy, bhai?”

He understands what she means. He knows the checked ledger of their kitchen: flour running out three days too early, tea leaves turned twice into something that tastes like history, the gas cylinder that never lasts as long as the uncle said it would. He also knows the way the rent man looks at their mother when she knots her dupatta and says, Inshallah, next week. No one counts more carefully than the poor. The math of it becomes religion. It is never only his therapy. It is their dinner. It is school fees. It is whether Shahnaz can get her teeth fixed before the gold plating turns into a joke.

“I’ll make enough to embarrass you,” he says. “I’ll become a millionaire and buy you a goat.”

“Buy me a bike,” she says, “so I never have to sit in that wagon again when the men look at me like I am a plate of sweets.” Then she says, in a voice that is not gentle, “Murad—don’t let them make you angry.”

He has an old anger that lives like a dog in his chest. Trained to bark at the wrong things. Trained to bite if bitten. He has tried to starve it this last year, feeding it small promises. He nods at her. “Go to school,” he says. “And don’t correct my sign for now. The customers will think I am humble.”

In the afternoon the sky hazes to a color that is neither silver nor brown but something from a photograph that has been left on a windowsill. A man who smells like cardamom and leather enters. He has the hands of someone who has not hammered a nail in a long time. There is a little pause as Murad registers the face and the face registers him.

“Tambi,” Murad says.

Tambi, who once drove for a councillor with chains on his wrists like an advertisement, laughs. “My mother says I get heartburn now because we had too much meat in our youth,” he says. “Also because someone wrote my name against a curse when we were boys. You remember the canal road, ha?”

Murad knows. He always knows. “I only remember that you drove like the earth was a rug you could pull up,” he says.

Tambi puts his knuckles on the counter, leans. He glances at the labels. His smile stays wide and stays near his teeth. “So this is what you do now. Oils like for the ladies. You will rub my temples and tell me to breathe.”

“If you like.” Murad picks up the khus. He keeps the stopper in. He has learned that people need to feel something ancient to change their face. “Vetiver,” he says. “Khus.” The word tastes like coconut husk. “It smells like rain on mud. Helps with heat. Grounding. The British wrote books about it when they were trying to sleep in tents.”

Tambi laughs again. “Ha. British. You always have some line.”

Murad closes his fingers around the vial to warm it a little and sets the clay dish near the burner. He does not ask too many questions; he has learned how suspicion can slide around like water, finding any small hole to get inside a person. They still call Tambi to drive sometimes when someone important wants to meet someone else important in a place where nobody goes. He can see the need in the man’s shoulders though, the way they are too high as if a wire runs through them.

“If you want,” Murad says, “we can try smelling this and then you sit for ten minutes. I’ll play something that isn’t religious or romantic so the mullahs and your wife both approve.”

“You married?” Tambi asks, eyes quick like they are used to snatching.

“No.”

“Better. Married men are on a rope from two sides.”

“How is Bhatti?” Murad asks, and they both let the name sit there like a knife, handle out, blade in.

Tambi’s mouth goes flat. He picks up the small cup of tea Zoya has slid towards him from the curtain behind the counter, as if she is a hand that brings tea and not a girl with a language. He sips. “Bhatti says he saw you near the Masti Gate last month. He says your mother started going to the shrine again. He says you will come back when you get bored of pretending.”

“And what do you say, Tambi?” Murad’s voice is soft like he is talking to his own knee.

“I say people like us don’t really get to ‘come back,’” Tambi replies. “We get to die or to disappear. There is no third act with applause.” He sets the tea down. “Give me the smell. The khus. Do whatever you do. If I suddenly start crying like a woman, I will kill you.” He grins to show he doesn’t mean it and also to show that he might.

Murad breathes. He has a way now: make things small, focus on one thing that cannot harm you. The cotton pad soaks, the green-brown oil darkens it, the flame makes a tiny pool of warmth. The room fills with a cut-grass cold that doesn’t belong to Lahore at three in the afternoon. Tambi’s shoulders drop an inch without his permission. The walls un-grit. Even the vendor from the next stall—a man who sells bicycle bells and complains that no one has feeling for sound anymore—peeks in.

“It is like lying on the floor of my grandmother’s house in Sahiwal when they watered the lawn,” Tambi says, and his voice has a grain in it that wasn’t there a minute ago.

“I know,” Murad says. He remembers being small and too hot and not knowing yet that everything can turn into losing. He remembers water, and all the lines of it across a courtyard, and his mother squeezing her plait like a coil.

After Tambi leaves with a bottle and an appointment, after two aunties come in to smell everything without paying, after a boy with acne asks if there is anything that can make a girl forgive him and Murad says, “Only if you say you are sorry without acting like you gave her a favor,” he closes the shop and sits on the threshold. He can see the line of pigeons on the wire like notes in a song played by a nervous hand. From deeper in the bazaar someone sings a few bars from a film song and then stops as if he remembered himself.

Shahnaz calls only to say the electricity has gone and there is no one to fix the fan—“Zoya is studying by candle like a heroine in a black-and-white picture,” she says—but also to ask, “You ate, beta? You will get ulcers empty like that. God did not design you to run on air.” Her voice is tired around the edges. She is still too young to have that much memory in her voice, but it is there.

“I ate,” he lies. He looks at the empty samosa paper in the bin and pretends there were two.

When he locks the shutter there is a man leaning on his motorbike two shops down. He has a mustache that wants to dominate his face and a jaw that is trying too hard. His boots are polished. He is completely average in a way that is a choice.

“Murad Awan,” the man says, like a schoolteacher at roll call.

“Yes?” Murad keeps one hand in his pocket. People like this are often happiest when you let them feel like the room belongs to them.

“I am Sub-Inspector Noman,” he says. He drops the “Sub” casually. “I heard a rumor about your little therapy place. Thought to see. And also, since I am here, to remind you that your eyes are on you.”

Murad smiles a little and then erases it. “You mean your eyes are on me.”

“Same thing, no?” Noman’s teeth are very white. “The mohalla is like a tea cup. Everyone’s spoon is ready. You make waves, they stir. I personally do not like aroma. It gives me sneezes. But it would be bad, I think, if someone violent decided to come and sit in your shop and smell oils. Imagine the paper headlines. ‘Murder at Aroma! Killer Comes Back to Senses!’” He is pleased with himself. He nearly claps.

“Nobody will be violent here,” Murad says. “They will be sleepy.”

“I do not believe people like you sleep.” Noman straightens his collar. “I have hope for your mother. She is very devout. She tells me she prays for my promotion.”

“My mother prays for everybody,” Murad says, and then cannot stop himself. “Even for the ones who make fun of her dupatta.”

Noman’s eyebrows go up and then down like a shutter. “Good. Then I am blessed.” He starts his bike. “Listen, Murad. Try to be small. Small does not get seen. Don’t make me come count your bottles.”

“I will be a dust mote,” Murad says. “I will be a thread that breaks before it can offend a needle.”

That night he walks home past the cold storage where the generators throb like enormous hearts, past the tea stalls where the men fall backward in their chairs laughing, past the charred corner of a peeling wall where someone has written, in unsteady Urdu, The one you keep calling for is also calling for you. In their three-room apartment, Zoya has dragged the table close to the window to feel the breeze. She is drawing a timeline for Mughal emperors that looks like a very long caterpillar. Shahnaz has fallen asleep on the divan with the TV remote resting on her chest like a thin bird. There is a pot of rice on the counter, and three green chilies lined up next to the salt the way his mother likes to do when she is feeling neat.

“You should have eaten that last samosa,” Zoya says without looking up.

“There was only one. You take it.”

“I already did.” She grins with her teeth tucked away like she is hiding them. “Don’t scold me.”

He makes a thin omelette that is more onion than egg. He eats with his fingers and watches his sister’s pencil move along the paper. “Who is that?” he asks, pointing to a crown with extra points.

“Humayun,” she says. “He fell down the stairs because of his books. That’s what the teachers joke. Like it is funny. Like it isn’t everything.” She taps the pencil. “You like this, bhai? This shop?”

He doesn’t know how to say it. He tries: “When I smell the oils, I feel like there is a clear road for five minutes. Do you know this feeling? Like the traffic has stopped for you though you are not important.”

“You’re important,” she says simply. “You’re my important.”

Shahnaz wakes with the news anchor’s voice in the background like machinery. She sits up and says, as if she had been waiting all her life to say it again, “I had the strangest dream. Your father and I were running through the alleys of the old city, but it was raining mirrors. All the windows were reflecting our faces and we could not find ourselves. Where were you?”

“I was under the table,” Zoya says.

“Don’t be cheeky.” But Shahnaz’s smile cracks into the room like golden paint. When she is happy she looks almost like the photographs where she is not married yet and everything is still possible. Film-star eyes. The sort of laugh that makes tailors look up. She touches Murad’s cheek, the way she used to when he would come home with his knees bleeding. “Allah give you respect,” she says softly, and the words mean something like, “Let there be some other thing for your name to be tied to.”

The next week is a string of small hours and smaller remarks. Men come in, sniff, leave, come back without saying they came before.

“What is it for, khushboo?” one asks, suspicious like the smell will reveal him.

“For your breath, and your grandmother’s shawl, and the night you fell from the bicycle and didn’t cry because your cousin was looking,” Murad says without thinking, and the man buys a bottle of lavender.

A woman comes and cries without warning when she sniffs the rose like it holds her mother’s voice in it. “I am sorry,” she says, “this is ridiculous,” and he shakes his head and gives her a tissue and does not look at her while she puts the bottle in her bag. A young chor comes in and tries to steal the frankincense, pocketing it with a magician’s ease; Murad stops him by saying his name. Just his name. The boy puts the bottle down and the theft drains from his face. “Don’t tell Bhatti,” he whispers. “He’ll use it on me.”

“What would he even do with frankincense?” Murad asks. “Sacrifice you to a Roman god?” The boy grins and slinks away and later returns to pay, cheeks pink, pride somewhere on his sleeve.

On Friday, he closes early and goes to the shrine. He has not told anyone this is what he does because then it becomes someone else’s story and he cannot hold onto it. He goes because the qawwali there is not purely music and not purely prayer and because when the men clap in a circle he feels an old drum in his chest begin to keep time to something other than fear. Ustad Hafeez sits near the lattice where the rose-petal men throw petals; he is long retired from the attar trade but his nose is still a knife. His hair is white like smoke. He wears a waistcoat that could tell family histories.

“You have too much eucalyptus,” Hafeez tells Murad the first time they meet. “You can smell fear in a shop. It smells like disinfectant. People think they want to smell clean. They want to smell like childhood.”

“What does childhood smell like?” Murad asks, surrendering like it is a lesson he will not run from.

“Paper. And rice. And the Saturday your father said yes when he usually said no. It also smells like betrayal when your father actually meant no.” Hafeez waves it away. “Bring me the bottle. Let me teach your hand.”

Under his instruction, Murad learns to watch the men as they inhale. How grief sits differently in the shoulders than anger does. How a glance at the door is a person telling you where they are truly bound. He learns to dilute the stronger syrups of memory. He learns to say, “This will help you sleep if you also stop drinking four cups of milk tea at night.” Sometimes he catches his own reflection in the glass and nearly laughs. He is a man who knows the exact weight of a pistol and he is carefully measuring drops of bergamot. He is a line in a story he doesn’t know the end of.

Word spreads. As it always does. Not in neat sentences. Not in announcements. It spreads with people’s sleeves and their sighs and the way their wives look at them when they stop picking fights over chutney. It spreads with the woman who says to the other woman at the tailor, “I went there and I smelled something that made the road shorter.”

But it spreads differently too. It spreads because there are still men who do not love this change. A man in a paratha shop says loud so Murad will hear, “He thinks he can rub oil and become saint. God forgive him.” Someone else whispers, “Maybe he is still doing the other work. The smell is to confuse.”

Bhatti himself does not come, but his men do, as carefully as uncles at a school play. They lean in the door and let the scent touch the front of their faces and then retreat like someone tested them with water. Tambi returns, pays, sits, closes his eyes, breathes, and once says, in an enormous voice, “I dreamed I was inside a forest and nobody could find me. And I liked it.” Murad writes down the day and something that will remind him to ask later how Tambi truly sleeps.

It is at end of that week when Rabia arrives, on a day that has been roasted hard by the sun, the light so bright it makes things look borrowed. She is the widow of the tailor who used to measure him when he wanted a suit to look respectable for meetings where respectability did not matter. Her wrists click with glass bangles. She has a way of looking at him like he is exactly the thing she is seeing—no more, no less.

“So this is the famous smell place,” she says, setting her cloth bag down with a little thud. “I have headaches. And the girls in the factory have headaches. And if one of them faints near a machine again, I will set the whole machine on fire with the manager still hugging it. So. Give me something that stops a head from thinking it is a locked door.”

He gives her peppermint and tells her about water and one minute of dark every hour. He says, “You must also eat properly. Not just biscuits,” and she snorts.

“Are you my mother?” she asks, but she takes the bottle and comes again and brings girls who look like non-broken dolls. She tells him in a tiny voice one day, her bangles still, “The police came to see me after my husband died. They asked how much money he had hidden. I said we kept everything in the pocket of God.” She is not trying to make him cry, but a drop of anger falls into his old cup anyway and stirs up sediment he thought he had rinsed away.

He keeps clean. Clean in the way that isn’t religious but is close: he gives receipts even when men wave their hands and say “later.” He sits with the burner off when the city’s heat is a punishment and counts breath. He goes home early twice to eat with his mother so she does not look up at the TV and forget he is in the room. He is not used to the way routine can be like a polite companion. He is used to crisis, to knives that come out of nowhere. He keeps waiting, and when it does not come, his body does something new: it learns to rest one shoulder at a time.

At night, when the city quiets the way a crowd quiets, only if you listen hard, Zoya and he sit on the roof and throw peanuts at the neighbor’s cat until the neighbor yells in a way that is mostly performative. Zoya tells stories about the girls in her class: this one whose father sells secondhand books and talks like a professor despite everything, that one who has a laugh like spoons falling. She says, “Sometimes I think of just running,” and he says, “We can run together,” knowing that she will and he won’t.

“What would you call this if you were a writer?” she asks one night, lying on her back, hair fanned out so the stars can get stuck in it. “This part of life. Where you are in a shop with bottles and you believe everything so much it pains your teeth?”

“Chapter one,” he says before he can filter it.

“Cheesy,” she says, but she is smiling the way a person smiles when the killer in front of them become for a second a brother who tells jokes about time.

In the mornings, children drag their schoolbags like reluctant pets past his stall. A chaiwala sends him a cup without his asking. The chai tastes too sweet and like the cup was washed with something that smelled of ammonia and rose. It tastes exactly like Lahore. He wonders if redemption is allowed to people who are not the sons of saints. He wonders if it matters whether it is allowed if he can just do it when nobody is looking.

Once, late, when the lane is an empty throat and the moon is pulling on the wires, he hears footsteps behind him in that pattern he recognizes: not a random walk, something purposeful. He turns without appearing to turn. A shadow pushes off the wall and becomes a man, and that man becomes Bhatti.

Bhatti is not his real name. It was a title once, then it became an affectation, and now it is a mask that grew into a face. He is taller than memory says. His hair has thinned in a way that makes him look somehow more dangerous, as if his skull has come closer to the surface. He smiles. Murad used to think Bhatti’s smile meant approval. He knows better. That smile is a tool for opening doors.

“So,” Bhatti says. “Scent maker. Healer of hearts. Is this your pity party?” His voice is gentle and clipped, the way men who can be unkind in many languages make themselves interesting.

Murad lifts his chin. He doesn’t drop his gaze because the last time he did that with Bhatti, he nearly lost a corner of himself he liked. “It’s a shop,” he says. “It’s a very bad business plan, according to everyone.”

“What did I teach you about business plans?” Bhatti steps once into the light and then back so half his face is black radish. “Boredom is the best one. Boredom gets police to nap.”

“I am bored,” Murad lies. “Everything takes too long. Even cutting limes.”

“I can use you,” Bhatti says. “There is a councillor who thinks he is a tiger. He is a cat. A fat cat. It would be good to make him remember his species.” He says it with the ease of someone ordering more bread.

Murad’s stomach does something it hasn’t done in months; it curls up like it remembers how to fold. “You can use everyone,” he says. “Even the man who sells bicycle bells. He would make a sound and the councillor would run because people run from certain sounds. Use someone else.”

Bhatti watches him, an unreadable softness in his eyes that Murad remembers from evenings on rooftops when they were younger, when the city felt like a map you could mark with chalk. “You could have been my right hand,” he says, almost wistful. “Instead you will become a left nostril.”

Murad laughs then, and it surprises both of them. It is the wrong laugh and the right laugh. “Better a nostril than a fist,” he says, and then because he does not want to be brave in front of this man and he doesn’t want to die in front of his mother, he adds, “I’ll give you a discount. On chamomile.”

Bhatti steps forward. They are close enough now that Murad can see the little scar on his lip from where a childhood cricket bat cut him because he grinned instead of ducking. “I will come back,” Bhatti says. “We are never done. I say this not as a threat. It is the truth we both married.” He leans in, and the old smell Murad remembers—cheap cologne, smoke, something like copper—hits him like a memory you don’t want. “And listen. When they come for you because of your past, remember this. Keep me out of it.” He is smiling again. The words drop like stones in a well. It is impossible to know how deep they will go.

After Bhatti leaves, the lane feels too narrow for a while. Murad locks the door and stands so silently he can hear the oil settle in the bottles. He imagines himself as a glass vessel, full of waves that look calm until you tap them. He touches the label on the lavender, the handwritten one, crooked. He thinks about the men who will not forgive him for not being what they expect, and the ones who will not forgive him for what he was. He thinks about forgiveness as a thing you offer to someone else and then watch, surprised, as it lands on you.

He opens the shop next day as if nothing changed because this is the only way. In the afternoon, a small boy with a breath that smells of cardamom and a shirt that needs one more wash stands in the doorway and says, without prelude, “My mother cries at night. I can’t sleep when she cries. I get up and my stomach hurts. Can you make it stop?”

Murad beckons him in and gives him a chair and asks him to tell him what color his dreams are. The boy says green sometimes but mostly gray. He asks what his mother sings. The boy says she sings the old songs that smell like soap. Murad gives him a tiny bottle with a bit of orange and a bit of lavender and says, “Put one drop on your pillow. And tell your mother she can come here and cry in my chair if she wants.” The boy sniffs the bottle the way cats sniff suspicious things and says, very serious, “Okay.” He has eyes that look like they are only ever honest. He leaves a coin on the counter that is too small. Murad lets him.

He writes in his notebook that night: Boy. Gray dreams. Orange. Lavender. One coin. Then: Don’t forget Zoya’s bike.

Later, when he lies down, the fan ticks, and the neighbor snores through the wall as if he is sawing something down. He thinks of the line he will walk as if it is a rope stretched between two gates. At one end, a face he was paid to unmake and at the other, his mother’s hands smelling of dish soap and prayer. The wind comes through the small window and the city answers itself in a thousand little noises, coins hitting other coins, metal to metal, a woman singing under her breath while she sweeps. He sleeps without dreaming, which is a gift. He does not yet know that the world is about to tilt, as it always does when you begin to believe it won’t.

The day after is too bright, the kind of bright that makes fires start in cloth. Zoya is late to school because she has to sit on the stairs and wait while Shahnaz and the rent man look at each other like they are pretending to talk. She grips the railing so her knuckles blanch, then lets go because she will not become a statue of herself. At the shop, Murad lights a stick of sandalwood, and the smoke goes up in a straight line and then breaks sideways like a line of ants meeting a leaf.

He thinks: I am here. I am still here. He does not yet see the shadow of the thing that will come to his door wearing his sister’s name and change the angle of the street. He hears the sound of the bicycle bell seller tuning his bells and believes the day will be ordinary. He is almost content. He almost misses the small tremor in the city’s pulse that presages the kind of news you cannot fold away in your pocket and throw in the wash. He almost thinks this is enough.Chapter 2

The morning sits on the city like a warm bowl. Murad holds the shutter halfway up and looks at the lane the way a man looks at a patient he has come to know—counting breaths, listening for the rattle that means trouble, noting the ordinary cough that means nothing. A kite rides a pocket of air above the electric wires and then decides to drop like a coin in a child’s fist. He smells yesterday’s fried gram ground into the dust, the bruise of sandalwood left on the counter, the ghost of incense that clings to his shirt because he leaned too close to the burner before sleep and Zoya swatted him away with a laugh that was more sister than rebuke. He sets the bottles in a line that pleases him for no reason except that it pleases him and warms the clay dish with the same care you would use to wake a sleeping child.

By ten, the vegetable men have yelled their first prices and the bicycle-bell seller has lost his temper with a boy who thinks he can shake a melody into metal. A woman in a green dupatta with a border done in little mirrors pauses outside and pretends to read his sign like reading will change its spelling. She is taller than the usual aunties and carries herself like she has never had to apologize for taking space in a doorway. Her dupatta catches the light and throws it back as if the sun owed her something. She stays in the shade long enough that Murad starts to think she is waiting for a specific smell and not simply a moment to breathe.

“You are the one,” she says at last, stepping in as if they have an appointment and the delay was on his part. She has a small silver nose pin that does not glitter so much as insist.

“The one who?” Murad asks, and he makes his smile short so she can decide whether to return it.

“The killer turned oil man.” She says it with the ease of someone placing an order, not with the relish of gossip. She keeps her voice low so the bicycle-bell seller cannot sell the sentence to anyone for the price of a cup of tea. “I am Shagufta. I bring proposals. Good ones. Not the jokers who have three wives and a fourth apron waiting. I brought one for your sister.”

The word hits the room like a glass dropped in a bucket. Murad puts the stopper back in the frankincense and feels his mouth go very dry and very polite. The air changes without moving. He hears Zoya at twelve saying the alphabet backwards because he promised to give her his last mango if she could manage it, and he hears Zoya last week saying, “Buy me a bike,” and he hears the rent man’s boots on the stairs like someone rolling marbles. “You bring proposals for money or for sport?” he asks, and he is careful to let his voice sit down instead of stand up.

“For respect.” Shagufta looks around the shop as if it were a cousin’s kitchen she has known for years. She picks up the lavender, sniffs, makes a face like she tasted a memory and it was too sweet. “And for money. We don’t spoil the story. We tell the truth and we take what is fair. The man I bring would like to make his mother stop complaining and would like to make your mother stop worrying whether your sister will end up sitting behind a window for the rest of her life. He has a job that is not a fantasy. He has a piece of paper that says the government will keep him in a chair. He is not handsome but he knows it.”

“His name?” Murad asks, though he is already anticipating the taste of it in his mouth.

“Sub-Inspector Noman.” She watches him when she says it as if she is measuring how tall grief stands when you don’t ask it to. “He says he knows you. He says he can make a file close itself and sleep.”

Murad feels his dog of anger stand and then sit because the room is small and there is nowhere to run. He thinks of Noman’s smile like a piece of chalk that writes on other people without permission. He thinks of his mother’s prayer mat and of the way Zoya stiffens when men she does not like turn kind without changing their eyes. “My sister is seventeen,” he says. “She thinks of bikes and classes and a world that is not this lane. Your man thinks of chairs and files and taking the entire sky and making it a roof he can hold in his hand.”

Shagufta does not flinch. The nose pin catches light again as she tilts her head. “This city marries girls younger than that and calls them lucky because their husbands send plastic flowers for the dashboard. I have seen your sister at the grocer, arguing over the price of salt like it is politics. She is a plus. She will not be treated like a string on a kite. Say no and they will find another, and she will come to me later crying because nobody came to her. Say yes and she might hate me. I am not pretending this work is clean.”

“Did he send sweets?” Murad asks, and the sarcasm tastes wrong, like a spice thrown into the wrong dish.

Shagufta lifts her bag and sets it on the counter with a little theatrical flourish. It has a tin of soan papdi inside, the cheap kind which collapses into sugar like a building taken down by a whisper. “He said to bring these and to bring his salaam and to bring his patience. He is a very patient man when he knows the ending. He is less patient when people forget who holds the pencil.”

“I will take the sweets,” Murad says, and he does not look at the tin because the glittering letters on it remind him of fairs and of buying things with hands sticky from false happiness. “I will take your card. I will say that this motka”—he touches his head—“is not made for deciding any girl’s life in a day.”

“You will not take my advice?” Shagufta asks, but there is no vanity in it, only the sound of a woman counting hours in her head.

“I will take it and stir it like sugar into tea,” he says. “But I do not promise to drink the tea.”

She smiles then, and this smile is not a trader’s. It is the smile of someone who has carried pots of water for too long and now sees someone else notice the weight. “You have the hand of a cautious man,” she says, nodding at the bottles. “Do not let your caution become a story you live instead of a tool you use. I will come day after tomorrow to ask for a word you can stand by.”

When she leaves, the lane swallows her, and Murad watches the green of her dupatta become just another green among greens. He puts the tin of soan papdi under the counter and thinks of all the times sweets were brought to their house without joy attached to them. He thinks of the day his father came with a mithai box while his mother cried in the next room about the money lost, and how the sweetness tasted like an apology nobody was brave enough to say. He wipes the counter clean of a powder that is and is not sugar and goes to the back curtain.

Shahnaz is darning a heel with a patience that makes the room softer. She always makes things softer, even when she herself has been made hard by the men who talk loud and then expect her to lower her voice. Zoya is not there; her bag is in the corner, mouth gaping like a yawn. Shahnaz looks up when he enters and he sees that she already knows some of it. Women in this city know what comes to their door before the door is knocked. “We have guests?” she asks. “I heard a woman’s confidence from behind the curtain.”

“Auntie who brings proposals,” Murad says, and he tells her, careful to keep his words on the ground and not let them fly away like a warning he cannot catch. He says the name Noman and sees something pass through his mother’s face like a small cloud. It is not revulsion. It is something harder to acknowledge: relief with edges.

“He is educated,” Shahnaz says, and the word covers more things than it names. “He is a government man. He came to help when the bastard upstairs tried to take the electricity from our line. He stood with his hands on his hips and the man’s face changed. I thanked him, and he touched his forehead and said, ‘Sister, pray for me.’ Many men say pray for me like they mean shut your mouth. He said it like he carried the prayer on his back. I do not like his teeth, but I liked that.”

“Ammi,” Murad says, because he is suddenly twelve again and he wants to be on the floor underneath time, “he wants to put a ring on Zoya like a rope on a goat. He wants me to stop being a problem as a dowry. You think he doesn’t see us like a file he can put in a drawer labeled ‘Settled’?”

“I think,” Shahnaz replies, and she does not lift her eyes from the heel she is making whole, “that sometimes a ring is a ring. A rope is a rope. It is us who make it a noose or a promise. I think I would like to see the man come and put his eyes on my daughter and talk to her like she is a person. If he cannot do even that, I will feed him tea and send him away with a mouth too sweet to taste his own pride.”

Zoya enters like a gust, hairpins losing, sandals dusty, cheeks bright, and the room changes the way a teacup changes when a spoon trembles inside it. “Who is sending us soan papdi?” she says, because she has already found the tin and she has opened it and poked it and made a face like the sugar offended her. “If this is another uncle who wants to forgive our sins by marrying me, I will spit into his box and tell him God cannot be bribed with ghee.”

“It is a policeman,” Shahnaz says, and she says it in the voice she uses when there is news that is both a courtesy and a warning. “He is a Sub-Inspector. The auntie says he is decent. The auntie also says that she will come again. We should decide how we want to sit, my girl. We should decide whether we bring out the cups with the gold rim or the stained ones so that we tell the truth instead of the story.”

Zoya throws the tin lid down on the table and laughs, and the laugh is metal, not silver. “Bring the cups with the cracks,” she says. “Let him see where women drink from. Let him put his lips on something that has been broken and mended by a hand that did not ask permission. If he makes a face, fine. If he cannot see the gold in the crack, fine. He can go marry someone whose laugh sounds like a cushion.”

Murad watches both of them and thinks about how many times he has thought himself in the middle of some war only to realize he was standing on the lip of another he didn’t see. He goes back to the front and lifts the shutter a little more, making the door mouth wider so it can swallow whatever is going to be pushed through it. He hears Tambi before he sees him, the way the rubber soles land like apologies. Tambi enters with a hand on the back of his neck and a look like he has discovered a new muscle to be anxious with.

“They are checking documents on the canal road,” Tambi says without preamble, and he sits without being asked, which means he is not here for scent but for being in a place where he has learned his breath can come and go without being noticed. “They are bored. This is when they find crimes in a man’s wallet. What is this? Soan papdi? What is the occasion? Death? Marriage? Promotion?”

“Proposal,” Murad says, and Tambi’s head comes up like a dog’s when it hears a bag of food.

“They are coming for Zoya?” he asks, and his voice has a tension in it that is not laughter or mockery and not exactly concern either, but some cousin to both. “Who is it? Don’t tell me it is Noman. If it is Noman, I will go blind in one eye for a week.”

“It is Noman,” Murad says, and he pours the tea that Shahnaz has sent because she always knows when this man is in the room and her hospitality is the rope with which she binds her own fear. “He sent sweets. He sent a woman. He will perhaps send himself.”

Tambi blows on the tea and then drinks it and if he burns his tongue, he does not show it. He sets the cup down with a care that must have been learned from someone who taught him that sloppy hands make regret. “You could have worse. You could have better. You could have no one. You could have every hand at your throat. You could have quiet. You know there is no free quiet.” He scratches his neck and looks at the bottles. “Give me that one that smells like rain again. And tell me you will not say yes because you are tired. Tired is when you say yes to knives that look like spoons.”

Murad keeps his hand steady and gives Tambi the khus on a cotton pad because the ritual now is a thing both of them believe in. The smell rises like wet cloth on a rail. “I will not say yes because I am tired,” he says. “I will not say yes because I want to be a man who can tell himself things. I will also not say no because my teenage sister can set fires with her words that she cannot put out with her thumbs.” He closes his eyes for a second and sees Noman’s teeth again, sees Bhatti’s shadow like a man who stands where doors are, sees his mother’s fingers which have always been able to mend, and sees Zoya’s eyes which have always refused to look at the ground unless the ground held something she wanted.

By afternoon, the story has already walked, as stories do in a bazaar where distances are really only three sentences long. A woman buying blades says to the man selling them, “Do you hear? The killer’s sister will marry a policeman,” and the man selling blades says, “That is like teaching a cat to watch meat,” and the woman buys two more blades because she does not want to be the only one without an answer in her kitchen. The bicycle-bell seller comes to the door and says, “Mubarak,” and then does not know where to rest his eyes, so he stares at the glass and sees himself in six small reflections and becomes suddenly philosophical about nothing. Murad keeps his head and his hands as separate as he can keep them.

Noman arrives when the sun has moved to that position where it points like a friend you cannot trust. He comes with two constables whose mustaches try to look like fathers and with a paper bag in which there is another tin of sweets because men like Noman think repetition counts as sincerity. He does not take off his shoes at the threshold because he is a man who is careful about certain disciplines and careless about others. He looks at the sign, reads the word “Calm” in its wrongness, and a smile pulls one corner of his mouth up like a curtain that reveals a stage that cannot hold a play.

“Murad bhai,” he says, and he makes the “bhai” sound like both a favor and a ledger. “I came to congratulate. Or to be congratulated. You will tell me which one when you finish tangling all the threads you have been holding.”

“You could have sent a message,” Murad says, and he gestures to the stool that is not comfortable and is therefore honest.

“I am a believer in face,” Noman says. “Messages make men brave. Faces make them polite. I came to look your mother in the eye and to tell your sister that I recognize her as a person who will not make my house a quiet grave. I came to tell you that the weight you are carrying can be put down where I can see it.” He places the sweet tin on the counter and taps it twice with his knuckle like it has a pulse.

Shahnaz appears with a tray before being called, and her dupatta is pulled lightly over her hair in the way that says, I set this stage but I do not bow to it. She gives the constables tea with sugar measured as if it were medicine and gives Noman tea with less, because he watched her put the sugar in the constables’ cups and she will not give him the satisfaction of control. Zoya does not come from the curtain. She calls out a salaam that is textbook perfect and then says, “I am studying,” as if it is a prayer and a boundary at once. Noman keeps his grin riding his face but lets his eyes go to the curtain and back so quickly it could have been a blink.

“You are a busy girl,” he calls, and his tone is almost tender, as men’s tones often are when they are arranging furniture that will later be difficult to move. “This is a good thing. I like a house where the books are not just for dust. Do you like poetry?” he asks the curtain, and the question tries too hard.

“Not from policemen,” Zoya says, and Shahnaz coughs a cough that is also a warning and also a laugh. Noman lets the answer slide because he must.

“We will talk about poetry later,” he says mildly, but Murad knows that somewhere in Noman a line has been drawn that will be remembered. “For now, I have come to say that in our mohalla there are many people who love to talk. If I marry your sister, they will talk about other things. This is a service I offer for free. Also, we will be family. Family is a thing that holds down a paper when wind comes. You have a lot of wind, Murad.”

“I also have a fan,” Murad says, and he is proud of his voice because it does not break even though he can feel the dog moving in its sleep. “We have not decided anything. We do not decide before we taste tea and pray istikhara and ask the opinion of the one who is supposed to wear the ring.”

“Good,” Noman says in a way that makes “good” sound like “cute.” “Do all of that. Pray. Taste. Ask. I have patience, as I told our sister the other day when she kindly informed me she prays for my promotion. My mother prays too. You will like her. She doesn’t speak much. She speaks only when things are already decided.” He leans forward a fraction, enough to smell the vetiver in the air. “By the way, there is an administrative matter. A complaint came that your shop makes men high. I laughed. I said you were making them calm. My SHO did not laugh. He asked if we should come count your bottles. I told him we should wait two days. It is good we are giving you space to pray. God is patient. He likes us to be also.”

“Then perhaps He will like you,” Murad says, and he hates the way the words taste like borrowed courage. He hates borrowing anything from a man like this. “Two days is enough. Come back then. If our answer is yes, we will pour tea into the gold-rimmed cups. If it is no, we will pour into steel. Both will be clean. Both will not poison you.”

Noman stands and shakes his own cuffs as if they have dust on them, though there is no dust, only pride. He picks up nothing because he has already left the sweet tin and therefore the mark he wanted to leave. He tells the constables a joke with his eyes, and the constables laugh without needing a punchline, because this is their profession. He steps into the lane and the lane makes space for him and then grows back into itself as if he never walked there at all.

When he is gone, the space he occupied takes minutes to give itself back to the other people. The bicycle bells start their tinkling tentative chorus. The paratha man pretends to wipe his tawa and is actually warming up his gossip. Shahnaz puts the tray down and closes her eyes like she has been holding her eyelids open with pins. Zoya comes out of the curtain with a face that is not carved into anger yet, but is practicing.

“Do not marry me to a file,” she says, and the tremor in her voice is interesting; it is not fear, not exactly, and not disgust, exactly, but something like the moment before rain when the heat decides to give up. “Do not marry me to a man who thinks his uniform is a personality. I want to study in a room with a window that faces a tree. I want a bike. I want to smell things that are not this. I want to have a fight with someone I chose because they chew noisily, not because they can make a thana remember my name.”

Shahnaz sits down on the stool and rubs her temples with a degree of pressure that makes Murad think of the spots he rubs on the bottles before he writes their labels. “We are not goats,” she says. “We are not sacks of wheat. We will not be carried from godown to godown. But we must also not pretend we live in a story where love pays bills and the city forgets. The city does not forget unless it is drunk or dead. The city is neither. We will ask for a sign that is yours. If God is kind, He will send it.”

Murad thinks of signs and thinks of how men in his old world made signs where there were none by breaking things and calling themselves winds. He does not want to be a wind anymore. He wants to be a man who knows how to open a window without frightening the house. He lets the burner die and later, when there are no customers and the afternoon has turned into a lid over the lane, he walks to the shrine with nothing in his hands so his hands can be given something.

Ustad Hafeez sits where he always sits, as if the shrine grew around him. The qawwal’s voice reaches the point where it becomes a little raw, and this is the point Murad loves, when perfection becomes something human and the human becomes something that can be forgiven. Hafeez does not look up when Murad arrives; he lets the boy kneel beside him and smell the roses that always are and always aren’t the same roses from last time. The old man’s hands rest on his knees like birds that have become used to the branch.

“You have added neroli to your fingers,” Hafeez says, the way some men say hello. “That is good. It means you are trying to remember the part of the orange that is not the fruit.”

“An auntie came with a proposal,” Murad says, and it is absurd and true, and it feels like he is shaking a small tree to see if any safety will fall out. “A policeman wants my sister. He wants me to be a brother who is grateful. He wants to marry his appetite to our need.”

Hafeez hears it and laces his fingers together as if he is holding something that might try to run. “Men like that always come with appetite and with a napkin,” he says. “They wipe their mouths and leave you the cloth to wash. Listen to me and forget me if you need to. The base note decides how a thing dries down. The top can be pretty. The top can be ugly. It goes away. Respect is a base note. Fear is a base note. A girl like your sister knows the difference on the first breath. Your mother knows it on the second. You will know it on the tenth. Ask yourselves whether his respect for you is a smell that will last when the day has ended.”

“He says he can keep my file in a drawer,” Murad says. “He says he can come but not count my bottles. He says he can make the mohalla shut its mouth.”

“The mohalla eats with its mouth,” Hafeez says, and he smiles into his beard as if he has found a new story to tell the saints. “It does not shut. It sleeps. That man can give you sleep. But what will he do when he wakes and wants to talk? Ask him to come without his uniform and sit on your stool and listen to a song he does not understand and see whether he listens. If he cannot, the base is wrong. If he can, maybe he is human enough to marry a human.”

They sit and they let the clapping fill the space between them. A man nearby stands and begins the swaying that is a half-prayer and half-surrender, and a child crawls under the benches as if searching for coins. Murad presses his forehead to the ground and asks for Zoya to be given something that he can’t give her, and for himself to be given the courage to hold his hands open and not make fists.

He returns to the shop with a bag of cheap sweet biscuits he did not need and a bottle of water that is warm but feels cold because he can convince his tongue if he tries. Rabia is waiting at the door, her bangles arranged like they are a sentence in need of commas. She nods at his forehead, where the dust from the shrine has stuck, and says, “Good. You remembered where God listens.” Then she says, “Do not give your sister to a man who asks you to thank him for not hitting you. This is my advice. Also, tell me if you have anything for a man who thinks he is the sun and wants all the machines to turn towards him.”

“Is this the factory manager?” Murad asks, grateful to stand in a conversation where the stakes are not his bones.

“It is,” Rabia says. “He thinks because he can read English he can speak to me like the language belongs to his mother. I addressed him as ‘sir’ too many times last week and now I have to subtract three. Please give me something for headache that does not taste like surrender. And tell your sister to come tomorrow if she wants to collect applications for the scholarship. The NGO people are coming and they like girls who speak like they have teeth.”

Murad hands her the little bottle of peppermint and tells her not to be a hero about water, and he writes down the thing about the NGO on the corner of a bill because he will forget otherwise. Rabia taps the counter with a knuckle and grins in a way that is not simply kindness but something like conspiracy. “If the policeman comes, stand him under the fan that makes a sound like an old auntie,” she says. “Men like that hate being reminded they get old.”

That night, the apartment is a map of small tirednesses. The light burns, then dies, then returns in a sullen way that makes the fan tick and tick and then apologize with speed. Shahnaz has a headache that sits behind her eyes like a jealous aunt and refuses to go home. Zoya has stretched her notes like a cloth and pinned them in her mind by pretending to draw mustaches on all the emperors. They eat rice with potato curry and it tastes like the kind of meal that keeps human beings from becoming animals.

After everyone sleeps, Murad sits near the window and thinks about every choice he has made that brought him to a chair that looks at a wall. He lets his mind go to places it should not go and then calls it back like a dog that wants to chase a car. He hears a motorcycle’s approach and his heart jumps because he is stupid and because he is honest. The motorcycle stops and then passes, and he feels ridiculous for contorting his fear into prayer without a reason. He decides to do the thing Ustad told him to do because doing is better than letting the fear set like cement.

In the morning, he sends a message through the bicycle-bell seller’s nephew, who runs safaris between lanes for coins and for the attention of any girl who will give it to him. “Tell Sub-Inspector bhai,” the boy crows into the phone later because he will insist on putting honorifics on men who carry lathis, “to come tomorrow, in plain clothes, with his mother, in the afternoon when the heat is not an excuse for bad manners. Tell him we will put tea in the gold-rimmed cups. Tell him we will keep the fan on. Tell him he should leave his file in his office.”

Noman replies with a little tick that shows he is a man who thinks ticks are modernity. He sends a thumbs-up that makes Murad want to put his phone into the basin and then take it out and dry it because he cannot afford a new one. He tells Shahnaz, and she begins to prepare the room in the way women prepare rooms when they are also preparing to be looked at as if they were rooms. She sweeps the corners as if shame lives there. She changes the cover on the divan. She tells Zoya to wash her face and to wear the kurta with the little embroidery because she will be asked to stand as if she were a new pot and a hand wants to test the ring of it by tapping.

“Do not ask me to be sweet,” Zoya says, but she wears the kurta because she is not stupid, and because she knows that taste can be weapon as much as food. She pins her hair in a way that makes her look like a girl who will live to be a woman who speaks without asking a room for permission. She looks in the mirror and pulls down each side of her mouth to see what it would look like to fake being pliant. She does not like what she sees. She chooses to be herself and to pay for it after.

The hour arrives and so does Noman with a woman who is his mother because it is impossible for this auntie to be anyone else. She wears a pale shawl despite the heat and her fingernails are bare of polish and she smells faintly of camphor the way cupboards do where winter is stored. Her face bears the kind of neatness that comes from a lifetime of arranging things in piles and asking God to show mercy in the margins. She looks at Zoya and says, “Beti,” and Zoya says, “Aunty,” and for a moment Murad allows the smallest door of his doubt to swing open and let in a sliver that looks like peace.

They sit. They drink tea in cups that have seen anniversaries and deaths. Noman tries a joke about how government men are actually poor because their salaries are written with pencil not ink, and nobody laughs because nobody wants to give him an extra inch. His mother asks Zoya about school, and Zoya answers not like a girl who is interviewing for her own life but like a girl who knows that questions can be doors into friendship if you are lucky and traps if you are not. Shahnaz asks the older woman about the pain in her knee, because women will always rescue a conversation that is trying too hard to be important by bringing it down to the one thing that matters, which is whether a person can climb the stairs without saying ow.

For a few minutes something like normalcy tries to put on its shoes and go for a walk in their small room. Murad watches this and tries to let his hands be still. Then Noman turns a little in his seat, the way men do when they are about to turn the conversation into a street they like to drive. “There is also one tiny matter,” he says, and he puts two fingers together and holds them up like a bad actor. “A file, as I mentioned, that has your name like an old stain. It is sleeping. It is in a cupboard where it can grow dust and not be disturbed by men who have ambition. I can keep it there if I am family. It becomes rude to wake a sleeping baby in a family.”

Zoya sets her cup down and does not look at him, because to look would be to give him a place to put his weight. “If you marry me to make you polite,” she says, and her voice is even because she has a pen in her hand and a pen is power even when it is not being used, “then you are not polite. You are a man who wants a shield. I am not a shield. I am a person. If we do this, we will do it because when you see me you see yourself a little better, and when I see you, I do not see a uniform. Are you hearing me, Sub-Inspector?”

Noman’s mother shifts on the divan and flicks a look at her son, a look that says she has watched him be a boy who breaks someone’s toy and calls it angry fate. Noman smiles and spreads his hands and says, “I hear you,” in a way that does not answer the question. He stands, because he knows when to leave before the room tells him to. His mother stands too and puts her hand on Shahnaz’s arm in a secret sisterhood that is born of surviving men who think they invented rooms. “You will tell us,” she says, and she means a yes, she means a no, she means a life, she means an exit, and she squeezes once before letting go.

After they go, the silence is not a silence. It is an object that has been placed between them on the table. Shahnaz says, “He is not a bad man,” and Zoya says, “He is not a good one, not yet,” and Murad says, “We can be allowed to ask the world for more than a man who is not bad,” and they all feel suddenly too big for the room and too small for the choice. Zoya picks up her pen and writes a sentence in the margin of her history notebook in a handwriting that is like a climbing vine: I will be my own file.

Evening manages to come, as evening always does, with its smudges and its promises and its thin mercies. The shop stays open an hour past the time the shutters usually start to scrape because a line of girls from Rabia’s factory arrive in a flank that is both shy and sure. They smell like starch and hot cotton and iron. They hold their wrists together like they have become friends with the time clock that tries to make them small. One of them says, “Aunty says we should come and practice asking for things that are not allowed,” and Murad says, “Here you can ask for the whole world and I will tell you what bottle is a part of it,” and they smile because he did not laugh at them and because he told the truth in a way that respects their dreams as if they were citizens with passports stamped “possible.”

When he closes, when he walks home with a bag of okra and two lemons that are mostly bravado, he does not see the motorcycle at first because it is parked in the wrong place. Only when he reaches the stairs and hears a woman’s voice that is too loud for kindness does he know that the wrong place has moved. He climbs faster. He finds the rent man’s sister in their doorway, hips forming indignation, bangles like glass slogans, mouth a sharp instrument, and behind her Bhatti’s man with the narrow eyes, the one who used to hum tragic songs while rolling cigarettes.

“You are very lucky,” the woman says, and she says “lucky” like “dirty,” and Shahnaz stands with her dupatta straight and her back straighter and Zoya has her fists inside her kurta where they cannot embarrass her. “You have a policeman coming to take your stain and wash it with milk, and you cannot even pay your rent on the eighth. My brother is generous like a man who has eaten too much. He will forgive if forgiveness wears a bangle.”

“Tell your brother I will pay on Friday,” Murad says, and he says it in a voice that could be used to slice fruit. Then he turns to the man with the narrow eyes because it is better to turn to a known disease than to a new one. “Tell Bhatti I got his message. Tell him I am saying my own namaz. Tell him not to put his cheek on our pillow and call it silk. Tell him if he comes again in the shape of a woman with a threat in her mouth, I will forget the names of oils for a day.”

The man with the narrow eyes does not change his face, because changing faces costs men like him money. He nods the way men nod when they want to show they are water and not rock. “He says only this,” the man answers finally, and his voice is out of practice, like a machine that hasn’t been oiled. “When you are done with your perfumes and your poems, come remember who you owe. If you do not come, he will remember on your behalf. He does not like to remember other people’s things. It makes him sad.” He turns to go and then turns halfway back, as if a second hand has pulled him. “Also, he says to tell your sister she looks like she can make a lion eat from her hand. He admires that. He is a man who has always loved lions. But lions are still lions.”

After they go, the apartment feels like a place where a bird has flown into the ceiling fan and left a small feather of panic stuck to the light. Zoya laughs again, and it is too bright. “Tell him,” she says, and her sarcasm tries to build a fort around her fear, “tell him we are vegetarians now. Tell him our lions eat spinach. Tell him next time bring his mother.” Shahnaz shuts the door with a little bang that is not angry so much as a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence she does not like.

They eat without talking because words would make the food dry. After, Murad goes to the roof because air is needed though the air is sticky. He looks up and the stars have been dampened by the city’s insistence on lightbulbs, but the few that remain are stubborn. Zoya follows and leans her head on the wall and says, “I will not marry him,” and he says, “I know,” and she says, “We might have to leave,” and he says, “We might,” and then they do something they have not done since they were children; they count slowly together to fifty as if counting might make time fall into order and do what it is told.

In the night, a sound comes like a hand rubbing a sheet of corrugated metal. The cold storage hums. A child cries and is convinced by a mother that the dark is a blanket God has put there just for him. Somewhere, men argue about politics and call each other names they would not call dogs, and then laugh and share a smoke and go to sleep. In the morning, the mosque will release the day like a bird from a fist. For now, Murad keeps his eyes open and watches nothing move and everything move, and thinks: the base note decides. He thinks this and he thinks of Zoya’s handwriting like a metal wire, and he thinks of Bhatti’s mouth, and of Noman’s thumbs-up, and of Ustad’s advice, and of Shahnaz’s prayers that became the fabric of the room when there was no other cloth. He sleeps for a while without dreaming and then dreams a little about water. The dream is clear and it is cruel because it shows him a road with no cars on it and he knows even in the dream that one will come, if not from the left then from the right, and a man he does not want to be will step in front of it to push someone he loves out of the way.

At dawn, there is knocking that is not knocking, but the flat slap of someone who knows the door and feels welcome to injure it. He opens and finds the boy with the breath that smelled of cardamom standing with his narrow chest pumping and his eyes wider than honesty. “Uncle,” the boy says in English because school gives him words to use when he is afraid and cannot find the Urdu that tastes like panic, “please come. Factory. Fire.” He says another word and it is a name and the name is Zoya. He says it like an alarm, like a prayer, like a sentence he hopes will end with mercy.Chapter 5

The week after the fire has a smell that does not belong to any single thing. It is cotton that has been cut and burned, turmeric sweating out of the walls of lunchboxes, cheap plastic turned to a memory of petroleum, fear cooked again and again in the pan of the same sentence. Murad wakes to it and sleeps with it and cannot keep it from his clothes, no matter how much sandalwood he burns. He keeps finding ash in the fold of his dupatta when he lifts it to wipe the counter, as if one factory could be everywhere once it has been allowed to be hell.

Zoya’s cough starts as a polite thing and then becomes a statement. It sits at the back of her throat like a visitor who won’t put their shoes on to leave. She does not complain. She drinks the water Murad boils and cools and adds a slice of lemon to like the slice could cut a bad oxygen into a good one. She goes to school with her hair pinned cleanly as if she has never run down a smoke-blackened staircase with a girl’s hand gripped in her own, as if she has not seen a manager punch a clock off the wall in panic so he could tell a later story without time in it. She returns and sits with her notes and draws mustaches on the emperors until Shahnaz says, “Enough,” not because she hates the rulers but because she wants to see her daughter laugh and not rebuild a building with ink.

Rabia has burns that are not large but are mean. They are the sort that take their time, the sort that look like only a few stupid little blisters and then ruin your sleep because they choose their own hours to remind you of what heat can do to skin. She comes to the shop with her hand bandaged and her mouth sharper. “He told the inspector he tried to open the door,” she says of the manager, and her bangles clink to underline the lie. “We all know he keeps the keys hanging on a string near his belt like a locket. The door opened because Anila swung a stool at it until her shoulders nearly broke. Tell me something for pain and for not punching a man whose face makes you feel like the wall behind him also needs to be slapped.”

Murad does not ask her if she slept. He knows sleep is a favor that chooses its own beneficiaries. He mixes peppermint with a neat patience and adds a soft oil he has been saving, something bitter and small that smells like the peel of orange, because grief needs corners to run into and this scent builds little corners. He gives it to her and says, “Keep the bandage clean and keep your mouth just as it is,” and Rabia snorts as if he gave her a weapon and not a bottle.

Noman comes and walks the fire like it is a garden he is expected to keep neat. He wears plainclothes that fool nobody and a face that is both sympathetic and careful. He puts his hands behind his back and leans to peer at a blackened sewing machine as if it were a sleeping dog. He listens to the list of things that happened and the list of things nobody will allow to have happened. He makes a note in a small book that looks like it was made for bigger promises. He tells a journalist who bothers him at the chalk line outside, “Tragedy,” with the exact weight of the word and then says, “We will allow justice to run,” as if justice were a child that needed to be permitted to go down the lane.

Murad watches him because he has learned not to trust the part of himself that wants to label men quickly. He sees how Noman refuses to look up at the second floor windows for more than a second because in one of them someone has hung a banner made from a torn sheet that says in a deliberately childish hand: We were here. He sees how Noman stops a constable who tries to laugh too loudly with a look that is not cruelty but not kindness either. He sees how Noman takes a statement from a girl who has soot in the lines of her palm and speaks to her like she has a voice and not like she is a witness with a mouth to be moved. He holds all of this, and he holds also the memory of Noman’s thumbs-up and his mention of the file in the cupboard, and he refuses to let one drown the other because that sort of drowning is how you end up calling sharks dolphins.

Bhatti’s men are not visible and are therefore all the more present. The one with the narrow eyes passes by the lane once, stopping to buy paan in a way that makes the paan-wala’s hand shake. There are little accidents: a bottle slipping from the bicycle bell seller’s hand and shattering like a badly told joke, a boy tripping and skinning his knee and looking around as if from above, an uncle’s scooter refusing to start like the day is refusing to move. Murad feels the city trying to take a breath and deciding instead to make a sound that sits somewhere between a groan and a prayer.

At the shrine, Ustad Hafeez says, “Smoke sits in hair the way sorrow sits in certain years. You think you have washed it, and then in a hot wind it says hello again.” He takes Murad’s wrist in a dry, gentle grip and rubs the place where Murad wears nothing. “Add a little shamama,” he advises. “Not much. It is too proud. Just a breath. It makes the old equal to the new in the nose, and people need that now. If you make them smell only forward, they will fight you. If you make them smell only back, they will die.”

Murad goes to the market where the attar men sit as if time chose them to watch it pass. He bargains and is told he cannot bargain in a week when half the mohalla has cried, and he accepts the chastening and pays two hundred more, and the old man who takes the money slides him a tiny extra, as trade demands even when grief asks to interrupt. He comes back to the lane and watches how the daughters of the factory come in couples and trios, holding each other by the forearms like fishermen carry nets, and how their noses lift and fall like birds near the river. He gives them orange, not too much lavender, and a drop of shamama on their wrists with warning, “Just a time, not all times,” and they smile as if someone is telling them a secret that is not dangerous.

The boy with the cardamom breath begins to sleep a little, but he begins also to draw. He shows Murad a picture in pencil of a staircase and little circles for heads on it, descending not like an escape but like a procession. He has given each head two circles for eyes, and in one pair there are tears that are not shaded all the way in. “Is that your mother?” Murad asks, and the boy nods. “She is a little angry at God,” the boy explains simply. “She says it is not good, but she does not hide. I think He knows.”

Shagufta arrives with her green dupatta folded in a neat rectangle over her arm, and she does not sit because she is a woman who does not put her weight on furniture unless she owns it. “I am glad your sister is breathing,” she says first, because she is not a fool and knows the order of sentences matters. Then, as a woman who earns her living by making life into a list, she says, “And now what of the policeman?” She chews a clove and then moves it to the other side of her mouth with her tongue. “He sent me no message for a week, which is his message. He is sulking because your sister asked him a question. Does he think marriage is a thana that opens when he arrives and everyone stands?”

“Let him sulk,” Zoya says from behind the curtain without stepping out. She has become an expert at throwing her voice into the room like a rope and drawing herself toward it only when she wishes. “If he wants a wife, he should ask his mother to teach him to listen. If he wants a file, he should look in his cupboard and leave our house alone.”

Shagufta laughs, and this time it is not sharp, it is almost soft, and she looks at Murad with something like apology. “Bhai,” she says, and she is suddenly younger, the age of girls who still believe rickshaws can tell the future, “I told you I bring proposals for respect and for money. I do not bring them for charity. I do not bring them for threats. Return his sweets if you have not eaten them all. Or eat them and know that nothing in this city can make you feel honest about your meal unless you cooked it yourself.”

The day the notice comes is a day like a thousand others except that the light falls on the countertop and makes the bottles look like they are full of coins instead of scent. It is a municipal man with a moustache that looks as if it fell asleep on his lip and never woke properly. He hands over a paper that says something about licenses and public health and the danger of flames, as if Murad has ever left his burner alone. He says, “This is routine,” and then says, “This is not my fault,” and then says, “This is not about you,” and in this city those three sentence are meant to be three kindnesses at once. The paper gives him three days to shut his mouth and his door and go somewhere where men with little stamps can pretend to bless him with ink.

Murad takes it and thanks the man and asks him if he would like a little something for stress because giving gifts is how mohallas survive notices. The man looks longingly at the bottles and then at the road and chooses the road because he can hear who is on it. “Keep your head down,” he advises, which is a theological instruction as much as an administrative one, and leaves quickly as if paper is contagious. Through the little square in the shutter, the bicycle bell seller whistles a tune that means the opposite of celebration, and across the lane someone drags a chair like a dragged body.

When he closes early, Rabia is at the door, and her bandage has a new neatness or perhaps a new redness beneath it. “If you cannot open here, open somewhere,” she says. “Bring your oils to the factory grounds. The girls sit under the peepal tree in the lunch hour and pretend they are not smelling burned thread. They will pay with coins and with the news of which manager has quit because his wife has thrown a slipper at him for lying. We make our own market.”

Murad says, “They will think I am making a circus of grief,” and Rabia lifts her chin with a kind of dignity that cannot be purchased anywhere except in years that have contained both too much and too little. “We are allowed to buy treats when we have mourned,” she says. “We are allowed to make the air smell like the thing we wanted, which is not to die in a building. We are allowed to do this and to spit when men tell us we have offended their polite sadness.”

He goes. He packs a small crate with a careful hand: orange, lavender, a small bottle of shamama wrapped twice, khus because the ground is hot, rose because innocence is not silly. He sets the clay dish in a sack like a mother carrying a child who must be kept asleep. He walks with the crate like it is fragile pride. The peepal tree is older than any manager and has lost branches that can tell the story themselves, and the girls sit under it and pick at their food like birds at millet. When he opens the crate, they do not clap because this is not theatre, but the air shifts the way a body does when someone teases a knot out of its back.

He does not take their money first. He lays what he has in a line and explains as if he is teaching them a skill they will not need him for always. He says, “If you are fighting with yourselves, do not choose jasmine. It is too romantic and it will mock you when you are trying to be serious.” He says, “If your head goes tight at the same time every day, put this on your wrist five minutes before and make your own trick,” and he gives them peppermint in a little cup as if it were sherbet. He says, “If you are remembering the wrong things, put rose on your hairbrush and not your wrist so that when you sleep it does not keep you awake,” and a girl with a scar at the corner of her mouth closes her eyes like someone told her a verse of a poem she once loved and then forgot.

He sees that it is not a circus. It is a tent. The kind that can be pulled down fast and carried. In the office window above, the new manager—because managers grow back—watches and pretends not to. A constable paces by and tries to decide whether this counts as a gathering. When he passes, the girls clap once together, as if they have all agreed to applaud the joke that they are not supposed to be an audience. Murad counts the coins and hides them immediately because money left in the open invites envy and envy in men with pens can be a weapon.

Noman appears at the edge of the circle like a line drawn by a child who has been told to stay within the shape. He is not in uniform. He puts his hands in his trouser pockets like he has nothing to hide and everything to hold. He watches the girls laugh at something Rabia says about the manager’s new hair oil, which smells like an apologetic coconut. He watches Murad wipe the clay dish with a clean cloth as if attention to this small thing could guide the larger. He comes closer without stepping under the shade because some men believe their responsibilities include standing where heat makes them interesting.

“You should have waited for the license,” he says mildly, and Murad hears the words and also hears the music he has put underneath them: I can make it easier or harder depending on the instrument I choose.

“I waited for the day to stop burning,” Murad says. “It took too long.”

Noman’s mouth does its curtain smile. “You are liked today,” he observes. “It is a powerful drug, to be liked.”

“It is,” Murad agrees. “But you sweat it out. It is not a base note.”

This makes Noman look at him for an extra second. “Come in the evening to the thana,” he says, as if he is inviting him to play carrom. “There is a man who says he has a video of the door being locked. He does not want to give it to me because he says I will make it disappear. He wants to give it to you because you are now a saint in the eyes of girls who earn more than him in pride. I do not have time for this nonsense.”

Murad’s first impulse is to throw the man into a metaphor that makes him noble even when he is being lazy, but he stops himself. He wipes his hands on the cloth. “If he has proof, he should give it to the paper,” he says. “He should give it to a court. He should give it to a shrine if he is superstitious.”

“He will give it to a man who smells like rain,” Noman replies, unexpected and accurate. “Come at eight. Come alone. Ask Ustad if you need a permission from a saint. He will tell you that saints love evidence if it is accompanied by humility.”

The thana at eight is a place where boredom has put on a moustache and a bad shirt. Men sit and fold themselves into chairs in poses that will become memory in the backs of their knees. A fan creaks overhead like it is narrating a story nobody asked it to tell. A woman with a baby sits in a corner and judges every man who forgets to lower his voice near a child. The smell is the smell of all thanas: ink, sweat, tea that has forgiven too much, paper that was once trees and now is the hope of men who think paper will save them. Noman’s desk has a small plant on it that looks embarrassed to be alive.

The man with the video is smaller than his voice on the phone implied. He has one of those beards that are less religion than lack of funds. He sits on the edge of a chair like he has always been ready to run. His phone is held in both hands like a tiny coffin. He has the eyes of those who have been told they will be brushed aside and who therefore lean forward too far at every door.

“You are Murad,” he says, and he sniffs reflexively, as if a smell will confirm the rumor. “You saved girls. You broke the chain on the back door. You shouted at a manager. You should not have shouted. It made him angry. He will shut the next door louder.”

“I only broke a cheap lock,” Murad says. “Anyone could have broken it. Anybody with anger in his knuckles and a brick near his feet.”

“It was not cheap for me,” the man says, and he shows the video. It is grain and shadow and the bright square of a phone screen seen from across a lane. It is a man in a shirt shining with sweat and in a phone voice saying, “Lock it. Lock it. They steal thread. They run.” It is a key turning. It is a hand on a bar. It is the smallest cry, the one that is almost not there beneath the scrape of metal, and then smoke, so much smoke that the phone cannot tell what the world wants to show it. The man has lifted his other hand without realizing, and it trembles in the air as if holding the door open in the past could make a difference now.

“Why not give this to the paper?” Murad asks softly. “Why not send it to the man with the camera who wants to put your proof in a place where men cannot pretend they didn’t see?”

The man lifts his chin in a sudden brave movement. “Because I have a cousin,” he says. “Because my cousin needs his job. Because the man in the video is the brother of the councillor who thinks he is a tiger. Because the councillor is the friend of a man who tells policemen where to go to get promoted. Because I am not brave enough to be an orphan with my mother alive. Because you are a person they will not believe they can drown easily.”

Noman coughs into his hand in a way that is part amusement and part warning and part an old cough he has been carrying since childhood. “I can take it,” he says. “You can put it in my drawer with the plant and the reports about stolen motorbikes and the petition from the mohalla to stop the rickshaws from playing music that offends the mosque next to an uncle who plays music all night. You can trust that if there is a chance to use it, I will. Or you can make your own movie. But listen to me, both of you. The day you go to the paper, be prepared to not have a home in that same day. We are not Europe. Our papers do not have bulletproof glass.”

Murad looks at the man and at Noman and at the plant and at the fan. He looks at the baby sleeping with its mouth open like an astonished small fish. He takes the phone and watches again because he cannot believe the little sound in the first second and because Ustad told him once that the second smell reveals what the first hid. He says, “We will give this to the person in this city who is hungry for truth and also knows how to hide a bite behind their teeth. We will not give it to a mouth that cannot chew. We will give it to a woman with a camera and a voice that does not wobble unless she wants it to.”

“Who?” the man asks, and Noman smiles like a man who is allowed to be pleased when someone else chooses bravery that he did not order.

“Rabia knows a woman,” Murad says. “She is the one who makes the NGO people blush without making them leave. She makes them sign checks and then uses the ink as if it were a sword. If she refuses, then God has another idea for this video.”

They meet the woman in a clinic that is pretending not to be a newsroom. She has a sari that announces itself softly in a lane and a pair of shoes that could survive a flood. She holds their eyes and then looks immediately at the boy with the phone like he is the only one who matters. She calls him by his name and makes sure he hears it, and when she watches, she does not make a sound because some sounds would fill the space where an old despair is trying to be replaced by a new plan. She takes the phone and gives him another and tells him to leave for two days to his aunt in Sialkot with petrol money that she pulls out as if she is paying a bill for a thing already received. She tells him not to tell his aunt why he is visiting. She tells him to learn to lie about the weather.

On the way back to the lane, the city shines in a way that seems obscene and also comforting because it proves that the world does not stop when one building becomes a body. People are buying mangoes as if the season will punish them for their hesitation. A tailor has put little satin bows on a baby’s dress as if the baby will hate her future less if the bows behave. A man carries a mirror on his head and does not look into it because he knows his face. A woman scolds her child and then kisses him because scolding is only half of the job. Murad buys guavas that are not yet ripe and eats one anyway at a corner and the sourness cleans his teeth and lies about hunger.

When he returns, the shutter is up, and the inside of the stall has been made into an accusation. Bottles have been smashed cleanly and the oil has run in little parables into the cracks. The sign has been taken off, the cardboard with its bad “Calm” peeled like a sticker and carried off to some wall where someone will use it to wrap a paan and spit out a moral about men who try to become other men. On the wall, in a red that is almost cheerful, someone has written the old word: Qatil. It has been written in a hand that is proud of its loops. It has been written with the swagger of a boy whose blood is not yet exhausted by tomorrow. It has been written eye-height, where customers will see it and decide whether to buy or to turn their noses away from a smell and towards a story.

Murad stands for a full half minute and waits for the anger to arrive like it used to, with barking and with a leash he had learned to hold. It does not. It comes as something else. It comes like tiredness mixed with laughter, like standing in front of a mirror and seeing your face not as a weapon but as a weather report. Zoya comes and stops with a sound like a cough that refused to be a sob. Shahnaz puts her hand on the wall next to the word, as if to hold it there until it becomes too bored to stay. Tambi is there before anyone called him and stands with his hands a little apart, as if showing the room that he is not holding a gun.

The bicycle bell seller takes a rag from his pocket and spits on it and then hesitates because saliva is not holy even when you feel like using it as a sacrament. Rabia arrives with her bandaged hand and says, “If it is so important to say what we already know, then write also ‘Brother’ and ‘Son’ and ‘The man who brought peppermint to a room that had forgotten its own breath.’ Write that too.” Someone laughs from the back, and laughter is a cleaner. Zoya goes to the box where Murad keeps old cloth and pulls out the yellow duster that used to be a kurta sleeve and begins to wipe. The red smears but does not disappear. It becomes pink and then becomes something that can be painted over. She says, “Bring me chuna,” and the bicycle bell seller runs to find lime as if he has been preparing all his life for this errand.

They paint. It is not an erasure because the wall will tell anyone who cares to look that there was something there before. It is a cover with a color that tries to be honest without giving the past the pride of place. When they finish, the wall is the wrong shade but it is a shade that belongs to them, a poor compromise that feels more honest than freshly bought paint would have. Murad sweeps the glass with a slow care that makes a rhythm, the sound of shard against broom like a chant. He picks up the little squares of label that remain, the part of rose that says “ro,” the “ver” from vetiver, and he puts them in a small dish the way men put coins they are ashamed to spend.

There is quiet and there is not. The mohalla performs its sympathy like a dance it knows well and means. Someone sends tea. Someone sends samosas that are a little stale because nothing is ever perfect on a day when you need it. Someone sends a boy with a ladder. Someone sends a smile and nothing else because not everyone has coins. Ustad comes with his hands behind his back and shakes his head at the colored mess and then says, “Good. Now take the shamama and make the room smell bigger than the writing on the wall. Teach the nose to choose to say yes even when the eyes are offended.”

Murad lights the dish and the smoke goes straight up and then refuses to behave and moves sideways like a man avoiding a question. It fills the stall with something ancient and a little arrogant, and in this moment he is grateful for arrogance. He puts the bottles that survived in a shorter line and they look like a company that has lost men but still reports for duty. He takes a torn piece of newspaper and writes “Khushboo & Calm” again with his bad hand and tapes it up and lets the badness be the joke they all need. People come in, because people do, and one woman buys two small vials because she wants to buy their resistance more than the oil and whispers, “Put it in my bag so my man thinks it is medicine.”

In the evening, the video goes to the woman who will know how to put it into the mouth of the thing that calls itself truth. She gives them a plan that is as much about taxis and back doors as it is about courage. She says, “Tomorrow morning,” and there is a way she says it that makes the morning sound like an enemy who has also agreed to have tea with her. She says, “They will call me a liar before they tell the story, but somebody’s aunt will send it on a WhatsApp and we will win by the old aunties.” She laughs once, then stops laughing because laughter can attract attention in a city where attention is a sort of bullet.

That night, Murad and Zoya sit on the roof and do not count to fifty. They count the lights that go off in the buildings around and then the ones that come on again and then the ones that stay dark. They try to guess which darkness is a voluntary darkness, a darkness for sleep, and which is a darkness that has been pushed upon someone by a man who took a wire like a whip. They are not good at this game because darkness is darkness and guessing the kind is not consoling as a pastime. Shahnaz brings them tea though they did not ask and sits between them and says, “If I die, bury me where the roses grow. Not because of the smell. Because the petals fall and are swept and fall again and are swept again and nobody thinks of it as tragedy.”

In the morning, the video is everywhere it should not be. It is on a phone in a rickshaw driver’s hand, making his passengers lean forward as if that will change the ending. It is on the small TV in the tea stall, where men crowd to see whether they recognize the back of a head because the city is small and heads repeat. It is on the phone of the rent man’s sister, who watches it twice and then watches it again to see whether she can blame poor women for something because that is the one tennis she plays well. It is in the thana, where the plant on Noman’s desk droops a fraction because plants can detect moral weather. It is in the councillor’s office, where a man says, “fake” and the word bounces off the wall and returns to his forehead.

By noon, there are two responses, because there are always only two. One is the swift denial, the promise of an inquiry that will take as long as a human life, the reminder that the man’s brother is known to the man who gives policemen their stars. The other is the movement of women and their allies towards a large place to stand together so that their anger can ferment properly into something that smells like action. Rabia organizes without making a big speech. She tells the girls to wear dupattas that do not slip. She asks the boy with the cardamom breath to hold the water with his two hands and not let men take it by making a joke. She tells Murad to bring his oils not so they can be spectacle but so that he can put peppermint under a nose when a girl begins to fold in the sun.

Noman sends a message that says, “Careful,” without saying “careful,” and Murad reads it and puts his phone down and ties his laces tight for once because he does not want to understand what it feels like to run without shoes. Zoya takes her notebook because she will take notes even when she is angry because she knows that memory is a paper that will be argued with in kitchens. Shahnaz folds a cloth and puts it in her bag because she has learned to carry a clean cloth to every new event in her life: births, deaths, marches, proposals that smell of two men’s chests rather than a woman’s breath.

They walk, and the city is again what it always is when people leave their houses together: beautiful and frightening. The road gives them space and then takes it back to remind them that nothing belongs to anyone. A man on a bicycle rings his bell and then puts his palm on it to mute it because it has begun to sound like a laughter that does not respect grief. The girls from the factory walk with their wrists bare, bangles at home because glass becomes too loud when you raise your hand in public. A man selling balloons stops and ties one to the end of his cart and watches and decides without saying it that today he will sell fewer and charge more.

The ground outside the press club becomes a room, because people turn the air into walls when they decide to hear each other. Men with cameras try to stand taller than they are, and women put their elbows into the space between two men’s shoulders and make a place for their view like a blade makes a place for fruit. Speeches start, and the first is bad because the man cannot help but put himself inside every sentence as if he invented the mouth. The second is good because it is a list of names and ages and not a list of theories. The third is Rabia’s, and she says plain things with a mouth that refuses to become artful. She says, “They lock us in because we make money for them only if we behave like their pockets,” and “They will call us the reason for our own smoke,” and “If you like poems, fine, but today I am a tailor’s widow and not a poem,” and the crowd makes a sound that is not applause but something deeper: approval that arrives reluctant because it knows it will cost.

There is a moment that will become a story and will be told wrong by men who were not there. It is the moment the police line becomes a wall and then a sieve and then a wall again. It is the moment a boy throws a bottle because he cannot think where else to put his fury and then looks immediately ashamed because his mother will see it on the news, and the bottle lands not near anyone at all but that is not how the city will remember it. It is the moment a man in plainclothes—who is he? he is always half known—reaches for Rabia’s elbow as if it belonged to his father and she turns her body in a way that saves it and also makes the hand look foolish. It is the moment Zoya, whose anger is a new flame, opens her mouth to speak and then closes it because she remembers that sometimes the voice you need is not the shouted one but the one written in the margin later. It is the moment Murad sees, over the heads of the crowd, Bhatti.

He is balanced on a kindness, because he has bought a packet of biscuits for a child and is giving them with a performance of care that has always been the way men like him try to seduce their conscience. He wears white, which is audacity on a day with dust and sweat. He looks well in the way a man looks well when his sins are not yet due. He tilts his chin and finds Murad in a way that says, Always, and puts two fingers to his temple in a salute that is both loyalty and threat. He is not there to break anything. He is there to measure. He is there to see who speaks and who listens and where the police walk when they pretend to be neutral. He is there because men like him keep their names in the mouths of the city by attending every event that looks like an opportunity for another story.

Noman is there too, in uniform now, which means he has had time to go and change and come back so he can be believed by men who only understand cloth. He does not look at Murad. He shouts once at a constable whose lathi has developed a personality. He receives an order in his earpiece and says, “Understood,” and chooses, with that one word, how to turn the crowd from a room into a fight or into a parade. He chooses a soft option, the one where the line is allowed to breathe and the women are allowed to leave without being shoved so hard that later they will tell themselves it was all a mistake. He looks at the plant on the desk in his mind and decides to water it tonight.

After, they are tired the way a day can make you, and the city tries to be kind by sending a breeze that smells of the Ravi even though the river is a little poisonous and so is the smell. The video has done its work. The manager has been “suspended,” which is a word that makes a hammock out of wrongdoing. The councillor has made a speech about enemies of progress who dream of factories burning because they hate the poor, which is a sentence that is delicious to men who own too many shirts. The girls have gone home differently than they arrived because they have learned where to put their elbows in a crowd. Rabia’s hand hurts, and she does not cry because she knows that crying now will make her pain tomorrow lazy.

At home, Shahnaz puts rice on to boil because rice is the treaty between the city and the stomach. Zoya sits with her notebook and writes not a poem but a list: What to do if the door is locked. Who has keys to what. Where the ladders are. Which windows open and which ones just pretend. She writes at the top in that wire-hand that could fix radios: Plan for the day we are not lucky. She shows it to Murad and he does not scold her for making the room into a class. He adds a line in his own bad letters: Also—where is the smell of the exit? He means it as a joke and as a serious thing, because the nose has led him away from worse than smoke.

He goes downstairs to the stall and finds on the counter something he did not expect. It is a small parcel wrapped in a page of an English newspaper with a picture of a man in a suit looking as if his teeth hurt him. Inside is a vial of something dark and old. The note says, in a hand that tries for elegance and manages only politeness: For when sleep becomes a room with many doors. It is not signed. The smell, when he lifts the stopper and lets a sigh of it out, is deep and a little salty. It is amber, old and a little like whale. He knows the men who have this do not give it because they like sentimental gestures. He knows the man who sent it wants to be remembered as a person who knows how to speak to a nose. He knows Bhatti’s base note when he smells it.

He puts it back. He tapes the notice about licensing next to the new “Khushboo & Calm” sign in a way that makes both look like they are taking part in a duet. He tells himself that the base note decides. He tells himself that Noman’s mother looked at Zoya as if she were a person and not a future. He tells himself that the manager’s brother will not be able to eat in the same restaurant for a while without being given a look by a waiter that will turn his water to vinegar. He tells himself many things because the city demands that you rehearse your arguments not for court but for your own heart.

In the night, he dreams of water again, but this time the road is not empty. There are cars, hundreds, and yet he is able to cross, one careful step at a time, because all the drivers suddenly remember a rule they were never taught: if a man walks with intent and his head high and his palms open, you do not kill him. In the dream, someone calls his name and he cannot tell whether it is a quarrel or soft. He wakes to the sound of rain beginning, the first real one after the heat’s tyranny has been broken, and he stands at the window and watches the lane accept it like a gift and like a new chore.

The rain brings children out to be ridiculous in it and brings rats out because rats love a change in lighting. It brings leaks into the corner of the room that Zoya had told him existed and he had ignored. He puts a bucket and pretends the sound is music. It brings a man to his door with hair made into curls by the weather and a mouth that is new to courage. It is the man with the narrow eyes, but his eyes look less narrow now, as if he has had to open them to avoid falling. He stands in the doorway and does not wipe his feet because he has never cared about such things. He says, “He wants you to come,” and then, before Murad can build a sentence, says, “He is not angry. He is... something else,” and for the first time since Murad met this man, his voice carries a small respect.

“Tell him my answer is the same as yours usually is,” Murad says because he cannot help it, because his sarcasm defends him in a way oil can not. “No.”

The man shakes his head the way a dog shakes rain from its ears. “He found out the video was yours,” he says, and he watches Murad the way a player of cards watches a man who has just drawn a queen. “He is impressed that you did not sell it to him. He hates being impressed. He would like to ask you whether you prefer to be a man who serves a new prince or a man who serves no one and gets old too fast. He would like to give you something. It is not a thing you can hold. It is a way to move.”

Murad laughs, because he is still a man who laughs when danger brings flowers. “Tell him I already have a way to move,” he says. “I walk. I go to the shrine. I come back. Sometimes I am late. Sometimes I am on time. My way is very boring.”

The man with the narrow eyes steps one foot into the shop and his boot leaves a wet print that looks like a fish. He says, very quietly because perhaps the rain has made him into another person for a second, “He will not threaten your sister today. He respects the march. He has a mother. He is also going to ask a favor that you will find ugly. He will ask you to carry a smell in one of your bottles. He is not joking. He has noticed that in a city that is afraid of everything, nobody is afraid of a man with perfume.”

Murad’s stomach does the old fold again, and for a second he can hear in his own head the sound a padlock makes when you close it and the key is on the other side and you are an idiot. He says, “Tell him to bring his own smell. Tell him my bottles are already full, and if he insists on putting his hands on them, tell him he will smell like lavender for ten days no matter how hard he scrubs.”

The man stares at him for a second as if recalculating a sum that has developed a conscience. He nods and then, in a strange moment of myself-ness, reaches into his pocket and places on the counter a small plastic packet with three marbles in it. They are cheap marbles that boys shoot at coins near drains. “For the boy,” he says, and does not explain which boy, but Murad knows, and the man turns and leaves, and the rain closes behind him like a curtain.

He closes early because the rain tells him to. He makes tea three times because he keeps forgetting he has put water on. He sits and writes in his notebook a new line: Video. Woman with shoes that could survive a flood. Plant in thana. Rain’s respect. He writes, then, because his hand cannot help it: Base: what lasts when the crowd goes. On the line below he writes: Noman: mother’s eyes. Bhatti: ambergris. Shagufta: clove. Rabia: peppermint with steel. Zoya: orange peel and the sound of a bicycle bell.

Downstairs, the water goes into the crack near the threshold and makes a small river that goes nowhere. He places a piece of wood so the river can go where it wants. He lies down and the bucket’s sound becomes a metronome that does not mind being loyal. He thinks of tomorrow as a thing with two hands. He hopes one will be gentle. He falls asleep with his palms open because he has remembered, finally, that nothing can be placed in a fist except a fist.Chapter 8

The rain left Lahore looking as if someone had wiped it with a damp cloth and then forgotten to dry the corners. The lane outside Murad’s stall shone in patches; brick glistened like fruit. Pigeons came down lower than usual to bully the thin worms that had lost their sense of direction, and the bicycle-bell seller tuned his bells against the new shy quiet, as if sound had to be persuaded to return to work. The awning still ticked, holding drops that fell on a rhythm that was nobody’s intention, and the smell in the air was a disagreement between gutter and river and last night’s frying oil. Murad unlocked the shutter and found the dust had settled in a film that presented itself like a challenge. He wiped it with the sleeve of the shirt he had reserved for meetings that pretended to be civilized and told himself he would take the license notice seriously because sometimes the way to stay dangerous is to appear obedient.

The licensing office sat behind a row of neem trees that had managed to grow in a geometry that suggested they had been summoned by an architect with a ruler and not by birds. Inside, it was the usual chorus: fans that creaked like old uncles, men whose hair had made peace with sweat, a clerk with forearms that were the same color as the ink on his fingers. On the wall there was a sign that said “Public Service Is Worship” in Urdu, English, and an officious silence that did more work than the sentences. Murad took a number on a little card and watched a boy try to count the numbers as if they were a game that would end in sweets. When his turn came, he slid his application across with both palms flat and a small bottle in the tray that was not a bribe if you named it a gift. The man behind the glass had a mustache that tried to claim credit for his entire face and a nose that flared at the first inhalation the way a man’s does when he has been surprised by childhood. “Khus,” the man said, the word deep in his throat as if it had been hiding there. “When my grandmother watered the matting in summer, the house smelled like this and my mother slept after months of not sleeping.” He signed the paper with the casual flourish of a man who knows his own power and pretends he does not enjoy it too much. “No open flame,” he added after the stamp hit the page, because he needed to keep a portion of his dignity. “And put your burner on a brick. Bricks spill heat into the earth. Wood is proud.”

He carried the blue-stamped paper back as if it were both a flag and a piece of bread. The boy with the cardamom breath saw him from halfway down the lane and came running with both shoelaces open, his chest a little drum making small impatient sounds. Murad took out the packet of marbles the narrow-eyed man had left in the rain and held them like a magician who cannot resist having a fanfare for a simple trick. The boy gave the kind of grin that is wider than the mouth and the sort that makes you forgive a city its petty meannesses. He rolled the marbles in his palm and said, very seriously, “These are for when my stomach hurts in the night. I will roll them on the floor to hear a better sound than my mother’s crying.” Murad wanted to apologize to him for the fact of the world and for having nothing to offer except small glass globes, so he did the next best thing and made sure the boy took one drop of orange on his wrist so that even the crying could be interrupted by a smell that said, look, there is another thing.

Rabia’s burns had begun to tighten in mean little crescents around the edge of her bandage, and the impatience in her shoulders had begun to relax into something more useful. She arrived with a stack of forms under her arm and a face that looked like a challenge to any man who thought an instruction could be given in one direction. “The woman with the shoes that could survive a flood sent these,” she said, thumping the forms down as if to test the table’s loyalty. “Scholarship. Girls with marks and mouths. Bring your sister at two. Tell her to comb her hair like someone who is not ashamed of her head and to put her cough in a pocket and forget it there for the interview. These men don’t know what to do when a girl’s lungs announce themselves.” Zoya came at one, because punctuality is courage in another shirt, and sat reading the questions aloud to her mother so that the answers could be practiced like lines from a play that refused to be melodrama. When Murad showed her the license stamped with magnanimity, she tapped the paper with her nail and said, “Good. Now buy me a bike that is not older than my teachers.”

The bike he found had been a boy’s once, painted a red that had faded to a brownish courage. It had a bell that insisted on ringing twice with every bump and a seat that had forgiven weight it should not have had to. He brought it home with a grin that felt like a borrowed shirt too big in the shoulders, and Zoya rode it in the alley with her dupatta tied like a banner, her hairpins doing their work with the fervor of loyal servants. She wobbled once and did not fall, and there was a small cheer from the balcony two floors up where the rent man’s sister stood because even the ungenerous cannot resist applause when wheels make balance look like magic. Shahnaz clapped with her fingertips because she had learned to make her clapping sound like modesty and not like pride, and then went inside to cry a little over a sink to hide the relief that she had not known her spine was waiting to feel.

In the afternoon, Noman sent for him with the formality of a man who cannot afford to confess to liking a person who is inconvenient. The plant on his desk had changed color in a way that implied either care or a different place on the windowsill; it stood a little straighter, and Murad had a brief unworthy thought that perhaps the plant had been swapped for a more optimistic specimen. “The manager has been arrested and then bailed and then arrested again for a different reason, which is how we teach men to change,” Noman said without smiling. “The councillor has gone suddenly very fond of the word ‘conspiracy.’ When men discover that someone has seen their ugliness, they pretend ugliness can be a word that only their enemies use. I am telling you because when the wall pushes back, it does not look to see which hands leaned first.” He rubbed his temple with the back of his hand in a way that said there had not been enough sleep. “Also,” he added, almost casually, “do not carry anyone else’s bottle to any party. The city is very impressed by your hands right now. You will be asked to borrow that impression.”

It did not take long for the request to become a person in front of him. The narrow-eyed man came the next day with a politeness that sat on him like a borrowed jacket. He did not stand on one foot or look at his boot or do any of the things men do when they are ashamed because he had not yet decided to be ashamed. “Bhai says come to Regal, the tea place under the old cinema posters,” he said, and he used “bhai” like a man lighting a match in a room where he is not sure whether gas is leaking. “He is not angry. He is smiling with his throat.”

Regal’s tea stall had always been a place that pretended film was still the country’s first religion. The walls were the color of old lemon peels, and there were posters of heroes who had died handsomely and women whose eyeliner had outlived the name anyone called them. Bhatti sat under a hero with a pistol and the kind of mustache that made a country believe in itself briefly. His white kurta was the sort of white that either required a new shirt every week or a washing woman who had decided to collect her sins in the service of other people’s cleanliness. He poured tea from the pot the way a host does in a house he has made by intruding on other people’s rooms and gestured at the chair opposite like it was his gift to make people comfortable. “You look like rain agreed with you,” he said. “Rain makes cowards brave and brave men soft. Which are you today?”

“I am the sort who drinks tea and leaves,” Murad said. He tucked both feet under his chair in the way men who have been told to be ready to run learn to sit in public. “Say the thing and let me say the other thing.”

Bhatti laughed, delighted at being allowed to show off his efficiency. “There is a mehfil,” he said. “A qawwali at the councillor’s house. He cannot resist clapping in the wrong places and pretending it is devotion. Musicians like him because he pays and because his guests are generous with praise if not money. There will be trays. There will be attar. There will be a moment when the bottle passes near his right hand because he is a man who is superstitious about right and left. Give him a particular bottle. Put it in the tray that will go to his side, not the one that will pass by the guests. He will lift it because that is the way a man shows his taste in front of other men he wishes to impress. Then, later, he will get the smell on his clothes and go to his office and the dog in his guard’s hut will go mad at the gate where my man will be waiting. The rest is a matter of timing and of a minute of bother for a man who thinks all minutes belong to him.”

“And what is in the bottle that is not a smell?” Murad asked, though he already knew enough to dislike knowing more.

“A powder that tells truth to cameras and stains even a politician’s thumb if he tries to wipe it on his dignity,” Bhatti said, pleased with the neatness. “We have learned not to use bullets unless we wish to announce we are children. This will make a man step into a story he cannot step out of without washing his hands in public. All you do is select from your little world of bottles with the reverence that has made your name a softer word in certain rooms.”

Murad thought of the bottle of ambergris waiting in his stall with its note in a good hand and of the marbles gleaming like small planets in the boy’s pocket. He thought of Noman’s plant and the way Ustad held his hands like birds that knew how to return to a branch. He drank the tea and made a face because it was sweet enough to make a man generous to himself and therefore dangerous. “No,” he said, and in refusing he felt a lever somewhere in the room push against a wall that was not visible but very present. “I will not let my tray become a gun. I will not let the girls who come to my stall to smell orange become accomplices in a man’s humiliation because you have found a way to make cruelty smell like a cleverness.”

For a second, Bhatti’s smile went away and his actual face arrived. It was surprising how young that face still was, how the boy who had once run too fast on a dusty pitch with a bat that did not belong to him could be seen in the man who made grown men’s sweats turn to ice. Then the smile returned, part theater, part habit, and he leaned forward enough to make the air carry the fact of him. “Listen, Murad,” he said in a voice that wrapped itself around the ear. “Refusal is not a brave thing. Refusal is a story you tell to yourself when you are alone and wish to hear applause. I am offering you a way to stand in a room and have men say your name with the respect that is not given to saints but to those who make saints useful. If you refuse, I cannot promise you what will happen to your little stall. I cannot promise you what the word will be on the wall tomorrow. I will not touch your mother. Even I am not stupid enough to pretend that would be anything except a confession. But the city is a place where wind finds doors that men forgot to lock.”

Murad put the cup down on its saucer and made sure it did not clink in triumph or in fear. “I have already locked the door that you think you own,” he said. “If you want to spray your powder on someone’s thumb, do it with your own hand. You have so many loyal boys with narrow eyes. Tell them to bring a tray. The councillor will be happy to be served by an admirer who has shaved in his honor.”

Ustad Hafeez listened later like a man given a piece of news that had been waiting several days to be spoken out loud. They sat at the shrine as the rain hung around, tired of the roof and not yet ready to return to the ground. “Powders are for carpenters,” Ustad said, almost absentmindedly, and then he took Murad’s wrist and pressed his thumb into the thin skin where the vein lifted and lay down again. “Remember the thing I taught you about bases. Remember that a top note can draw a room to itself and make men forget their manners. Remember also that the base is the thing that will sit on the collars of the poor when they have given their last five rupees to a bottle that promised them mercy. If you give your hands to this, you will wake smelling of it for months after the favor is over. There is a little thing you can do if you cannot avoid being placed near the tray,” he added, because he was a practical man and had learned that philosophy does not always win. “Carry asafoetida in your pocket wrapped tight. It sits like an insult in a room and will make even the proudest nose decide the party must be held elsewhere. You cannot be blamed for ruin if your ruin smells like cooking.”

Shagufta came with her dupatta cleaned of last week’s marches and a mouthful of clove that made her sentences go around corners. “The policeman has sulked himself into silence,” she reported, and she looked almost sorry for him in the way a woman sometimes feels tender toward a man who has made himself a child for a day and is convinced he is a storm. “He did not send for me. He did not send sweets. He did not send a prayer request. Either his mother has told him to grow up or he has found another girl whose brother is less famous. Your sister can now sit in the same room as the future and not be asked to choose between left and right. There is a schoolteacher, a tall man with a good laugh that he does not use to hurt anyone, who needs a wife who tells him when his chalk has been snapped not to make children pay for it. I am only saying names. You will tell me if I should shut up.” Zoya came out from behind the curtain in the way she had learned to do when she wanted to be a person and not a voice. “Shagufta auntie,” she said, with the respect given to a woman who brings heavy things into a room without breathing loudly, “I am going to college if I can convince the universe. I will marry a man who thinks reports and attendance are love. I will not marry a man who thinks love is a period at the end of a sentence he has written without me.”

He stayed away from the councillor’s mehfil because there are some rooms you do not enter even with saints in your pocket. Bhatti did not send men to drag him because one of Bhatti’s talents was to know when to give a man rope and hope he would tie it around his own throat later out of pride. The night of the mehfil, Murad lit a burner on a brick as the licensing man had said, and put shamama in the dish because he needed the room to smell older than his fear. He wrote a recipe for something he would call Exit and tore it up twice because the ratios he tried turned memory bitter. He kept the asafoetida wrapped in a packet where it could be reached without being respected, and he laughed at himself for having loved a spice only when it could ruin a plan.

The boy who sold pirated DVDs came to the stall that evening with a dictionary in English that had been folded wrong so many times the spine had developed a limp. “I am learning words I will never use,” he announced, as if this were a noble foolishness and not the way people built ladders they did not know how to climb. “What is the difference between ‘mercy’ and ‘pity’ in English?” Murad leaned on the counter and thought, and decided to answer in smell because language can be too proud. He put one drop of rose in the clay and then a breath of vetiver and made the boy smell it first and then smell it again with a little frankincense. “Mercy is the smell with the grass,” he said, and his own mouth surprised him with its accuracy. “Pity is the smell with the smoke.” The boy nodded, and you could see the word become a part of his body that he would carry to a different street one day.

There were small mercies. The license hung next to the new bad sign and made customers smile even when they did not know why. The bicycle-bell seller began to ring variations he had never tried before, laughing at himself when he failed. Noman’s mother came one morning with her shawl smelling faintly of mothballs and camphor and stood at the counter like an apology. She did not introduce herself as anyone’s mother; she asked simply for something that would make a night seem less like a long hand pressing. Murad gave her lavender with a leaf he had steeped in orange flower water and told her to warm the jug and place it near her feet like a friend. She thanked him in a way that made him understand why Noman had learned to turn away when women were tired, because it is a dangerous thing to notice. “Your sister has the gait of a person who will leave,” she said suddenly, looking at the doorway from which Zoya had vanished like a well-taught trick. “Make peace with that. The rest of it, God knows, not us.”

Tambi came in at noon on a day that pretended to be winter and sat without speaking, which meant he was practicing bravery. He took the cotton pad Murad handed him and closed his eyes, and the smell of khus pulled a string from his chest to the floor and tied it there. “They asked me questions,” he said finally, his voice big in a way he did not like it to be, as if it were betraying him. “Not about the fire. About you. It was not your name the man used. It was your face, like a coin. He asked me, ‘Has this man come to you with a bottle? Has he asked you to take him inside a house?’ I lied.” He opened his eyes and looked at Murad in a way that measured hunger and regret and loyalty and the sum came out different every time a man learns something he did not wish to know. “If I tell them the truth next time, it will be because the truth is boring and they will leave me alone faster,” he added, and there was no request for absolution inside it, only an announcement of limits.

The whiff of powder at the councillor’s gate did not make the city news, which was too busy learning to speak about smoke without choking on the word. It traveled the way serious stories travel, by aunties and tea cups and boys at paan stalls who are practicing to be witnesses. “They had to make him wash his hands in the guard’s bucket,” a shopkeeper said with relish, putting sugar into a cup as if the sweetness had become a scandal. “My nephew says the dog would not stop whining when the bottle went by, and the guard said something in Punjabi that sounded like he was scolding his wife.” Bhatti did not send a message, which was the message. In a city where men love to tell you what they have done to you, silence is a declaration that the next watch will not be so noisy.

He made Exit in the end, not for himself but for the stall, because he had understood that smells could be architecture. It was orange, yes, because doors needed to be noticed, but it was also petitgrain, the leaf and not the fruit, because sometimes escape is a branch and not a gate. He put in a lash of peppermint because the body can be tricked into believing it is brave when its blood cools in the mouth. He added, against his own instincts, a breath of dirt he had saved from a pot he kept on the windowsill that had once held coriander. He tested it when Zoya coughed at three in the morning and found that she stopped counting her coughs long enough to say, “I can smell where the window is,” and then slept with her mouth open like a fish, humble and alive. He wrote down the recipe and made it messy on purpose so that if someone else found it and tried to sell the trick, they would have to work and therefore would deserve the profit.

The day the license men returned, one of them was the same, the mustache comporting itself as if it had done the stamping. The other was a younger creature with hair that had not yet decided whether to be an argument or a compromise. They stood at the threshold and looked in like two judges who had been promised a neat case and found themselves in a room that smelled like a decision they could not read. “Brick,” the older one said, nodding at the burner as if he had been the one to invent the earth. “Good.” The younger one asked questions as if questions were a road to power. “What is in that bottle? What is in that?” he said, and Murad answered as if the answers were recipes for a dessert, because sweetness is disarming when you make men swallow it with their pride. “Why do people cry when they smell rose?” the younger one asked suddenly, and the older one flicked a glance at him that was equal parts warning and memory. “Because their mothers did not let them finish crying when they were small,” Murad said, and all three men looked at the counter for a second because the eye cannot be trusted when the nose is weeping.

There was a quiet at home that week that did not feel like the pause before a blow. Shahnaz had her teeth fixed with gold that looked like a joke to the unkind and like a plane ticket to the compassionate, because it meant she had chosen not to hide her smile any longer. She went to the mirror and practiced not turning her head away at the last second and came back to the room as if she had walked in from a long journey and found herself still waiting there. Zoya returned from the scholarship interview with three sentences and three silences, which is how you know an interview is not a favor disguised as an exam. “One woman asked me what I will do when men tell me my laughter is too loud,” she said, tapping the table like a drum and not smiling. “I told her to leave the room. She said, good answer. Another man asked me if my brother is the man who sells perfumes near the bicycle bells. I said he sells air. He wrote something.” Murad pretended he did not want to know whether the writing was a black mark or a promise, because sometimes you must let a stranger satisfy his own vanity on the page before he can remember you are real.

At night, they went to the roof with cups of tea balanced in ways that would give the neighbors words if a drop fell at the wrong angle. The city had cooled in that patchy way, with one building holding heat like a man holds grudges and the next giving up as easily as a child does when sleep arrives in its honest clothes. They spoke of nothing because speaking of the future made it skittish, and instead they counted the cloths hung on lines that were not theirs and tried to guess which family used henna water and which one chose a new powder because the smell traveled like gossip. “If I leave,” Zoya said quietly, not as a defiance but as a rehearsal, “you will make new oils that smell like the day became bigger. You will not become a story that ends with a man folding his chair and saying that the city would not let him stand.” He nodded because he had not known until that moment that she was waiting for permission to be as bold as she already was. He gave it like it was air, unmeasured.

The next morning a parcel arrived again, handed by a boy who looked like he had only just learned to run for other people. It was wrapped this time not in an English paper but in one of those glossy religious calendars where the shrine is painted brighter than sky. The bottle inside was smaller than a little finger and darker than the previous gift. The note was shorter: Sleep when you can. Work when you must. Keep the bottle as a reminder of the difference. It was still not signed, but the handwriting had become more itself, as if the sender had decided to practice a virtue in his calligraphy if nowhere else. Murad put it on a shelf that was not a shrine and told himself he would not use it unless the room became another room entirely. He had learned, finally, that a city asks a man to keep one thing and refuse others, and that often the thing to keep is the promise not to carry someone else’s smell into a room where you have taught people to put down their fear.Chapter 9

Heat returned with a different character, as if the rain had negotiated only a truce and not a surrender. It sat lower, closer to the ground, choosing ankles and the backs of knees as its territory, and the lane adjusted in the way lanes do—chairs migrated to shadier centimeters; the bicycle-bell seller tied a wet cloth around his neck and claimed it was medicinal; the paratha man bragged that sweating was proof he was alive. Murad woke with the sense that the day was already partway through itself, a half-eaten fruit he hadn’t gotten to taste from the better side. He boiled water because the city taught you to start with something pure and ruin it as little as possible, and he stood by the window to watch whether the neem leaves were glossy for joy or merely wet with yesterday’s memory. Zoya coughed once, as if to square her account with the morning, and then moved through the rooms with the briskness of someone who wanted the day to know she had appointments with it.

The licensing paper hung in the stall like a neat shirt, and people found themselves looking at it as if it could read them back. Murad placed it deliberately near the bad “Calm,” and more than one man had smiled at the misplaced letter and paid without bargaining out of a desire to reward honesty. He had noticed that the license seemed to make women breathe easier at the threshold, as if a stamp somewhere in a municipal office had conferred upon his little space a form of consent they could trust with their feet. He put Exit in the front row with a handwritten tag he’d copied thrice so it would look as if it had always worn that name. When he told people what was in it he left something out, the way a mother leaves one trick at the end of a recipe so that a dish never tastes exactly the same in another kitchen. The boy with the cardamom breath showed the marbles to anyone who would pretend to be impressed; he rolled them on the counter and listened to the way glass decided the world was not flat.

Around noon, when heat lifts hope and turns it into a thing you have to carry instead of ride, Shagufta returned with a man whose laugh arrived before he did. He was tall in a way that didn’t apologize and wore a white kurta that had the dignity of work, not the arrogance of laundering. His hair was a recursive argument with a comb and his spectacles sat on his face like a gentle scolding. He extended his hand with the caution of a person who has met men with knives and still wishes to believe in palms. “I’m Ismail,” he said, and the name fell into the room without making anyone flinch. “I teach history to children who think tomorrow is a story their fathers will finish for them.” He looked at the bottles the way a person looks at a shelf of old books in a house where language is a privileged guest. “I thought this was a rumor. Turns out you have a shop.”

Murad liked him and distrusted himself for liking him. Liking was a smell that made you forgive too much. He glanced at Shagufta, who was watching everything and nothing at once, a clove traveling in her mouth like a messenger. Ismail did something Murad had not expected; he removed his spectacles and wiped them with a corner of his kurta and then, without putting them back on, leaned down and breathed the khus as if he wanted to meet it differently. “My mother’s verandah,” he said simply, and the admission changed the angle of his jaw from confident to defenseless. “She used to put the matting down and pour water as if she were waking a sleeping cousin. I can still hear the water trying to remember who it is.”

Shahnaz emerged from behind the curtain because a mother knows when a sentence has shifted a room. She had her dupatta pinned the way women pin their fear when it has learned to look like dignity. Zoya stayed back, as agreed, because they had promised not to throw her into anyone’s gaze like a scarf. Ismail’s eyes moved easily from mother to bottles to doorway and rested nowhere for too long, which Murad took as a sign of a man who had been told not to stare and had internalized the lesson rather than learned to cheat it. He bought lavender for his sister—“she listens to ghazals at midnight and I fear for her exams”—and he bought peppermint for himself with an embarrassed shrug—“the children bring their heat with them; I absorb it like cement.” He did not mention marriage and did not overplay his lack of mention; he let the room remain itself and left, and Shagufta lingered only long enough to say to no one in particular, “You can tell a good man by the way he leaves the air”—and then she was gone before the sentence had a chance to become a moral.

In the afternoon, Murad took Exit in his pocket and looked at it twice on the way to the shrine, as if a bottle in your pocket could change its mind when you weren’t watching. Ustad sat where Ustad belonged, but something in him had been moved farther back from his skin. His beard looked less like weather and more like a cloud that hadn’t decided where to rain. The qawwal’s harmonium had a sticking note, and each time it caught there was a momentary dislocation, a reminder that beauty in this city is obliged to hop, not glide. When Murad placed his forehead on the stone, he felt in his sinuses the old sting of rose water and dust and the idea that forgiveness could be a public spectacle. He sat with Ustad after the men had redistributed their coins and their secrets and he offered neroli without asking first. The old man let it roll in his nose and down into his chest and then let it go with a little sigh that had wisdom and defeat coiled around each other like string.

“They made me climb the stairs last night without a reason,” Ustad said after a while, his voice trying to be conversational and failing. “I went to the roof and the roof reminded me I do not own my own breath. I held the parapet and the parapet held me and we became old men together. Bring me gil for my knee tomorrow. Not too much. I don’t want to smell like I am trying to seduce the dead.” He chuckled, the sound a small drum. “You refused the man’s cleverness,” he added in the tone a tailor uses when he approves of a seam. “Good. Keep refusing until you are tired. The day you are tired, come to me and I will let you smell something that will make your refusal taste like a reason, not like stubbornness. And tell your sister that the trick to leaving a room is to open the window first. Men always forget windows.”

Back at the stall, the ambergris bottle sat like a minor god in the corner of his eye. He could ignore it the way a poor man ignores his hunger when a guest is eating, but sometimes the smell lifted its head and he had to look in order to not look. He had decided not to tell anyone where it had come from. The gift occupied a category of thing Lahore understood too well: a generosity that obligated you to use your morality as collateral. He would keep it as a fact, the way you keep a scar you cannot place.

Noman arrived at dusk with his uniform slung on his bones as if the clothes had promised to be lighter when he took the job and then changed their minds. He did not come inside; he rested a hand on the shutter and looked down at his boots like a man measuring whether his floor would hold. “The councillor smelled like a laundromat at the station,” he said without preamble. “It was ugly and therefore useful. I disliked him more and respected the method less. You did not go.” He looked up then, and the plant in his eyes was alive when yesterday it had been only hopeful. “Thank you for not going.”

Murad let the words be what they were, neither a favor nor a test. “Your mother came,” he said. “She asked for sleep. I gave her a thing that has failed more people than it has saved. She said my sister walks like a leaving.” He hesitated, the old Murad who had learned to put knives into every conversation coughing in his chest. “Do you want to marry a person or a position? It is a bad question, I know. It is not mine to ask. But the question has been living under our table, chewing on our socks.”

“I wanted to marry quiet,” Noman said in a voice so tired the word hung like a damp cloth. “I thought marriage would deliver it the way a boy delivers bread and then keeps the change. I do not know what I want that does not find its shape in an ambition I have adopted without thinking.” He smiled painfully and let it persist only a second. “Tell her I stopped sulking. Tell her to get her scholarship and leave if she can and become someone who makes men like me apologize without the city noticing. Tell her my position cannot learn poetry. My person can. But it will be late.”

That night, the apartment developed a new sound: hope trying to be quiet. It lived in the way Zoya gathered her notes, not in panic but with the deliberation of someone preparing to pack a bag. It lived in the way Shahnaz rolled out dough and pinched the edges with the same pressure she had used to pinch the skins of the children’s cheeks when they were small and insomnia was a punishment for adults only. It lived in the fact that the rent man’s sister stopped by to borrow salt and did not find a reason to be cruel, which in Lahore often passed for affection. Murad sat by the window and wrote in his notebook a list of words that had become newly heavy: refund, receipt, return. He added under them: remain.

Two days later, a man with a pouch came to the stall and asked for Murad’s thumb. He had an institutional smell—paper and heat and government soap—and hair too black to be trusted. The envelope he held was the brown of authority and had a corner bent, as if respect had been interrupted in the post. He placed it on the counter with a politeness that was either his or his instructions. “For the sister,” he said, and then, because this is a city where even messengers must have a line, he added, “If she leaves, write her name on the wall where she can see it from the bus.”

Zoya opened it in the back room because the front room had too many witnesses and she had decided to use the day’s luck privately, the way pious people eat fruit so their joy does not look like a parade. The letter was printed, which she liked, and had a signature that ran on the page like water, which she did not. She read it once as if that were enough, and then again because the body demands repetitions for both shock and mercy, and then a third time aloud, because language becomes real in a mouth. She had been given money that would not solve anything on paper and would solve everything in the soul: a year of fees, a room whose windows faced a tree in the imagination if not in fact, permission to carry her own bag. Shahnaz clasped her face in both hands and kissed her as if she had tasted the letter and found it sweeter than soan papdi could ever be. Murad sat and felt for a moment that his spine had been removed and replaced with a better material. He did not cry because he had promised himself he would not make Zoya’s leaving a festival. He did something else—he went downstairs and paid the rent man’s sister the exact amount they owed to the last rupee and asked for a receipt, and the woman spent the rest of the day feeling embarrassed without knowing why.

When the lane heard, it did its particular dance, the one without music. People sent small gifts that were both poor and proud: a packet of hairpins, a grammar guide that had survived one flood and three cousins, a tiffin of kheer that tasted slightly of smoke and therefore memory. The bicycle-bell seller presented a bell he had tuned to sound like the idea of approval; when you rang it, it produced a sound that made you think of teachers clapping gently and of afternoons spent learning the shapes of new alphabets. Tambi brought nothing in his hands and too much in his face. He hugged Zoya at the threshold with his arms in a shape he did not usually make and stepped back before it shamed him. “Don’t marry a boy who combs his hair too often,” he advised gravely, “and if anybody touches your bag, bite them.” He took Murad aside and said, “They will ask you to be mayor of this lane. Don’t. Mayors here are always men who can be blamed when God and electricity both fail.”

The first attempt to set the stall on fire was cowardly and therefore normal: a rag pushed into a corner while Murad turned to weigh a bottle, a flame that thought it could become a story. Exit found its use in a way he had not written on the tag. He soaked his handkerchief, tossed it at the rag, and made the smell of orange and mint and dirt argue loudly with the smell of burning without anyone dedicating it a poem. The bicycle-bell seller and the paratha man stamped with a joint rhythm that made the little fire too embarrassed to continue. The culprit was either a boy who would never admit it or a man who would—Murad refused to investigate because there was only one answer in either case: insult. He washed the floor with a bucket that had been counting its own days and did not speak the incident aloud to anyone. Silence, he had learned, was the only kindness sometimes available to a city whose rumors had long since become bored of themselves.

Bhatti did not return immediately with smile or threat. He was felt the way distant thunder is felt in a chest before it appears to the ear. Murad heard his name in the wrong mouths at the tea stall—said with admiration by men whose admiration had cost other men their knees. He saw a boy at the DVDs with a new phone that looked as if it had come with a health plan. He smelled a cologne once in a lane that tried to pretend it was expensive and only succeeded in smelling like the ambition of a shirt. He slept badly two nights in a row and instead of getting up to pace he lay with his palms open and counted the smells outside the window in a discipline Ustad would have been proud of: rats, rain rot, frying, metal, soap that had not rinsed properly, the particular grief of an old rug.

Noman sent a single message that contained a single sentence: The councillor is looking for a singer. He wants to sing louder than the video. Murad didn’t answer because that would have obligated him to an emotion. He read it and put the phone on the table and ate a boiled egg with salt and black pepper as if a boiled egg could be a moral. He thought of base notes again and found that the phrase had begun to live in too many parts of his life; he would have to be careful not to become such a nose that he forgot how to use his eyes. He made a blend he did not name and did not sell, a thing that smelled exactly like the word wait.

He carried gil to Ustad the next morning in a small earthen pot that had belonged to his mother long ago and had cracked cleanly and been mended with an iron clasp like a scar proud of itself. The old man let the heat sit in his hand and hiss and then he put it to his knee and closed his eyes and breathed in through his mouth so that the smell went where words could not. He taught Murad a useless thing then, because masters know when a student needs the luxury of uselessness. “There is a way,” he said, “to make two smells that hate each other stop fighting. You give them a third to despise together. Enemies become brothers when you provide them a better enemy. Keep asafoetida for men also, not just for trays. Introduce them to a bigger stink than their feud.”

On Friday, Shahnaz wrapped Zoya’s scholarship letter in a plastic bag and put it under a stack of plates because water is a bigger thief than men. They went to the shrine to thank God for paperwork, an act that would have sounded silly in another country and sounded pious here. Zoya put her head down and asked for the sort of protection that did not announce itself; she asked, in her own words, for safe shadows. Shahnaz asked for forgiveness for the pride she knew she was about to display. Murad asked for nothing he could name and gave the fakir a handful of coins that contained a rupee from his first day at the stall—the coin he had been saving for a day when gratitude could be trusted to be honest and not just fear in a pretty shawl.

On the way back, they passed a wall where someone had painted again in a neat hand. It was not Qatil this time; it was a sentence in Punjabi that belonged to a grandmother’s mouth: The smell of a man’s hands tells you whether he washes them after counting money. Shahnaz laughed and then stifled it because a policeman was near, and Zoya laughed because even policemen had mothers who laughed at truths, and Murad did not laugh because he was thinking of the bottle on his shelf and of how the city had turned his hands into a thing people took notes about. He went back to the stall and took down the ambergris and held it a long time and then put it back again and told himself he would keep it for the day he would need to remember that even the sea had to cough up a thing if it stayed too long in its stomach.

The afternoon brought a new customer: a midwife who had hands like explanations. She wore blue and had a voice that did not require microphones. “Give me something for a woman who has been in labor long enough to become a proverb,” she demanded, setting a bag down with a weight that implied she had saved three lives before lunch. “Give me something for four men waiting outside a door with cigarettes they say they are not smoking. Give me something for myself because I have not sat since Tuesday.” Murad gave her clary sage and orange and a nonsense story about an Englishman who fainted at the smell of birth and pretended later it was heat. She laughed in spite of herself and told him quickly, because there was always an exchange, “You know the girl with the burn at the corner of her mouth? She wants to learn English words for refusing. Send her to the schoolteacher. Tell him he must use chalk as if it were mercy.”

Evenings sharpened into the sort of dusk that made the city briefly look like a place that could forgive itself. The bicycle bells sounded like small brass birds; the paratha oil smelled less like tomorrow’s regret and more like food. Shagufta appeared once more and took a stool and chewed her clove and then announced, without preamble and without ceremony, “The schoolteacher says he won’t come again unless Zoya says yes to a cup of tea and a quarrel about the Mughal tax system. He is not patient enough to be a myth. He says time is a thing that men like him do not get in parcels. He says if she wants to leave, he will help her pack and then write his name on the wall too and be proud that his name came before her degree. I like him. Do not tell him I said so.”

Zoya answered from behind the curtain in the way she had learned to do in this season where her voice had begun to be her first door. “Tell him I will come for tea and we will quarrel about jizya and land revenue and who deserves to tax my laughter,” she said. “Tell him if he brings biscuits I will not say yes and I will not say no. I will say, pass me the cup.” Shahnaz threw up her hands and then adjusted her dupatta and smiled without showing her gold, which was her new talent. Murad sat very still and felt, in the exact center of his chest, a small knot of something loosen and then relocate somewhere useful, like the way a muscle acknowledges the right kind of fatigue.

The night before Zoya’s first day at the college that might or might not take her, Murad failed to sleep on schedule and failed also to convince himself that sleep was simple. He went down and opened the stall and lit the burner on the brick even though the whole lane would have scolded him if they’d seen, and he put a drop of the ambergris in the clay dish because sometimes you must steal from the future to bless the present. It rose slowly, old and salt and full of animals and maps, and it made the stall feel like a room in a museum where something impolite had been preserved for men who wore gloves. He breathed it until his shoulders stopped trying to climb his neck. He turned the burner off and sat with the smell in the air and thought of his own base note, of what would remain when praise and scorn had both finished their shifts and gone home. He hoped it would be orange peel on a windowsill and the sound a bicycle bell made before an exam.

He closed, and when he stepped into the lane he found the narrow-eyed man—less narrow now, or perhaps the wet had finally left the city’s edges—leaning against the paan stall as if structurally responsible for it. He did not scowl and he did not smile; he stood like an apology that hadn’t been requested. “He is sick of you,” he announced without malice, as if tired of summarizing men who mistook themselves for weather. “He will not visit. He will make calls. He will say names to ensure himself he is still a man whose sentences fall on other men’s heads. He told me to tell you that one day you will choose him because choosing nobody is a luxury that only saints can afford.”

Murad thought of saints asleep and saints awake and saints who had laughed at jokes that were ugly because they were tired. He thought of Ustad’s kneecap and the gil and asafoetida and the smell of clove in Shagufta’s mouth like a threat that had decided to serve tea. He looked at the man’s hand and saw that the nails were cleaner. “You can leave him,” he said, surprised to hear the sentence emerge. “It is a bad job to leave, but men have left worse jobs. I will not hire you. I am only telling you to practice thinking of it so your head does not break the day you try.”

The man stared at him as if someone had asked a dog whether it wanted to be a bird and the dog was considering it in good faith. “I cannot leave him,” he said flatly after a beat. “He knows my blood group.” He laughed without finding it funny. “But I can learn other streets,” he added, almost shy. “I can put my cheek to a wall and feel whether it will accept writing. I can tell you that the one that said Qatil last time will not take paint again; you will need a new coat that is not a coat. Do you know lime that hardens like arrogance?” He shrugged and kicked at nothing and walked away like a man who had emptied his mouth of something that was not meant to be spoken and now had to go find a different shape to hold.

At dawn, the city tried indigo again and almost succeeded. Zoya tied her hair with a ribbon someone had sent from Gujranwala three Eids ago and checked the pin twice out of defiance against falling. She wore the kurta with the little embroidery because it had been tested by both heat and compliments. She ate the egg white only and left the yolk for Murad because, she claimed, it would make his jokes better. Shahnaz prayed with the quiet thoroughness of a woman who had learned to put God on every list and not tell anyone. They walked together to the bus stop where the buses stopped when they wanted to and thus remained named bus stops out of courtesy rather than accuracy. A girl with an umbrella that refused to open properly stood near them and made no complaint about the umbrella’s character, which reminded Murad that patience was an aesthetic some days.

When the bus came, it did not slow to a kind speed. It announced itself with a horn that was half lament, half victory. Zoya stepped up as if she had invented stepping, and the conductor clucked at her bag and then moved aside when she looked at him the way a girl looks at a goat who is pretending to be a lion. She rang the bell the bicycle-bell seller had tuned and it made not a noise anyone else could hear, but something in the air tightened into competence. She did not turn back to wave because women in this city had been punished for turning back too often. She held the rail and became a figure moving away. In the small mirror above the driver’s seat, Murad caught a slice of her face and for a second saw their mother’s eyes as they had been at twenty; then the mirror caught another woman’s face, and then another, and then the mirror returned to reflecting simply road and dust and a blue sky that had decided to show off. He breathed Exit without taking the bottle out and tasted orange peel on the back of his tongue and promised himself he would count five deep breaths before he allowed himself to go and open his stall.

The stall had been his and would continue to be his even as the city rearranged the furniture of their lives. He rolled up the shutter and let the smell of yesterday climb the room like a vine. He touched each bottle and said the name under his breath, a small inventory of faith. He placed the ambergris on the highest shelf and put the gil under the counter and wrapped the asafoetida twice because it was a weapon and did not deserve better. He leaned in the doorway and watched the lane begin its day, the way the chaiwala slapped the cups in a rhythm that would become sacred if he had a better agent, the way the bicycle-bell seller nodded at a tune nobody else heard. He smiled at the bad “Calm,” at the licensing paper, at the empty chair in the corner where a boy had sat to learn the word mercy, and he waited for the first person to come with their breath and their grandmother’s shawl and their fight with their cousin and their request that smelled like memory. He would reach for orange or rose or mint or shamama and he would listen, which was the work, and he would refuse the tray that wanted to become a gun, which was the other work, and he would keep his hands clean in the one way that mattered in a city where washing was often theatre. He thought of base notes again and decided, for today at least, to make his the precise smell that clothes have when they have been dried in a room where the window was open.
