The arch used to be a cutout on the horizon, white as a clipped fingernail, and from the window of the bus the six-year-old Patsy would think it looked like some giant’s misplaced sewing needle, curved and intent and stupidly elegant, falling over the stadium like a scythe. Her father, who drove for a courier firm and had strong hands like spades, used to point at it and tell her the match scores he remembered most, the names that sounded like spells—Kanu, Beckham, Cantona—none of which ever stuck. What stuck was the way he slowed at the lights near Ealing Road and sniffed the air and told her, always like it was the first time, “You can taste the salt on a day like this, Trish. Even here.” Wembley was all concrete, wind, and the smell of batter and spices and wet coats. And it stayed. Even after she started using the formal name in her signatures and on her badge—Dr Patricia Maguire, Psychiatry—she could not manage to be anything but Patsy here.

On a Monday in late February, the wind peeled cold off High Road and churned crisp packets into a dance. She laced her boots on the front step of the terrace she rented off a landlord called Mr Shah (who was never to be seen beyond a handshake and emails that ended “Many thanks and kind regards, S.”), and stepped out, thinking of the week ahead: ward rounds, discharge planning, boundary reminders, the tightrope. The Park Royal Centre for Mental Health was her place of work now, a concrete ship marooned on Acton Lane, all strip lighting and corridors that smelled faintly of pickle, soap, and the sadness that clung to the place like a film.

She stopped at a newsagent and bought a banana and a tiny bottle of sour cherry juice that stained her lips. The shopkeeper had the morning news on, something about a government minister and a microphone left on, a storm slated to nick Scotland by afternoon. She nodded, paid, stepped back out. Wembley Central pulsed. A woman in a fur hood shouted into her phone in Gujarati about someone’s son’s proposed engagement; a man rolled a suitcase with a busted wheel that screamed. She slid into the flow and caught the Bakerloo.

There are acts you perform every day that require such delicate faith: trusting the man opposite you will not unroll himself like a map and start screaming, trusting the floor will not sag and swallow us all. In that way, psychiatry is like commuting. The people you sit with are always strangers until they look up and tell you something that makes your ribs ache. She had never lost the ache. She guarded it too much, she thought, for someone who was supposed to be clinical, bounded, neutral. She’d learned the right words. Attachment. Containment. Insight. Professional curiosity. But the ache stayed. She loved her patients. Loved them in the way you love rain when you know you’re indoors, safe. It pelted and she put her hand out.

At Park Royal, she swiped in, breathed the breath of it, and found Lottie in the office, flinging a scarf over the back of her chair with the drama of a matador. “We’ve three new admissions in the last twenty-four. Two sectioned, one voluntary in name only. And your nine o’clock is here already, eager as anything.”

“Do we reward punctuality with bad biscuits?” Patsy said.

“Digestives from the tin of despair,” Lottie said, and slid the tin across. “Also Dr Kwan wants to speak about the—ah.” She wiggled her eyebrows. “Arrangements.”

Arrangements meant someone upstairs had noticed their community team was drowning and wanted to put a plaster on the sea. It also meant evening clinics. It was always evenings, because evenings were supposed to be easy hours to fill, as if nothing bad ever happened after nine p.m., as if loneliness punched out at five-thirty.

“After lunch,” Patsy said. “Tell him I’m fresh out of morning smiles.”

At nine, she found the man waiting where people who are afraid to be misunderstood always wait, just to the left of the door, trying to be tidy. Tall, soft-eyed, worn thin. He held his hat in both hands as if it could float him.

“Mr Ibrahim,” she said, warmth like a coat she put on. “I’m Patsy. Come on back.”

They went down the corridor past the poster that said We See You In The Round (with a drawing of a circle of chairs) and into her office, which she always worried was too messy and then decided was human. The blinds leaned crooked. The old rubber plant in the corner leaned in sympathy. On the wall above the desk hung a print of the stadium arch at dawn, a gift from her father years before, framed behind glass that had cracked once and was repaired with glue. She had not had the heart to replace it. The crack ran across the sky like an old scar and sometimes when patients paused mid-sentence to consider their own words she watched their eyes travel that fracture.

He told her about the bad nights and the worse mornings. About the dizziness he did not want to call panic. About the way his son looked at him like he was a broken door. She asked the questions she had learned to ask. The ones about sleep, eating, drinking, the ones about the sudden desire to open car doors at high speeds, the ones about the knives in kitchens. He said no to most and nodded slowly to some and when his words snagged she let them. She never got over what it felt like when someone trusted you with the words they only said in empty rooms.

“You’re not the worst thing you think you are,” she told him, and wrote him a prescription and a follow-up and slid him a card. “There are groups. We have a Tuesday evening thing. Small. Six people. It’s… it’s very ordinary, and people expect fireworks and get tea. Tea can be good.”

He smiled, politely. Sometimes dentistry had more to do with psychiatry than anything else, she thought. The way people guarded pain with a hand held in front of the mouth.

Her nine-thirty didn’t show. She drank cold coffee. The day slotted, moved, tilted. Lunchtime came and went and Lottie ate a sandwich that smelled like egg and cress and told her a story about her son’s chess club catastrophe. Dr Kwan hovered in the doorway and did not tell his arrangements story until he had first told his cycling-in-the-rain story and then his electric-car-charging story, both of which seemed designed to prove some thesis about endurance the rest of them already understood. He was good and kind in the slightly self-conscious way of someone who had taught himself those habits. Patsy did not mind his slowness because it made hers look like speed.

Evening clinics then, twice a week. She nodded. “I’ll take Mondays. I’m not good on Wednesdays.”

“What’s wrong with Wednesdays?” he asked.

She shrugged. “They taste chalky.”

“You’re a very odd person,” he said, affectionate.

“Correct,” she said, and thought of the text she had ignored all morning, the one from her father. Dinner? Friday? You, me, Anj, and Mira if she’s around. Haven’t seen you in a fortnight, Trish. Kisses, D.

Mira if she’s around. That was a laugh. As if Mira did anything as light as “around.” Mira was a weather system that swung through and altered pressure and left aftertaste. And it had been longer than a fortnight since she had seen her at all. It had been months. A good season and part of another.

In her memory, in the house on Chaplin Road, there was always a bowl of fruit under a religious calendar that had come in the post from an insurance firm. The fruit blackened on the bottom where it kissed the ceramic. After school, before the late news, there had been the slam of the letterbox and the ad about kitchens with couples using power tools and smiling. Mira had come with the kitchen. That was how it felt at fourteen and sixteen, a renovation no one had consulted her about. Her father had met Anjali at the delivery depot. Anjali had hair that fell like a decision has been made. Anjali had Mira. Mira had a glare and a laugh and a metal bangle that clicked at her wrist and the expensive way of holding herself that made Patsy feel she was a thing made on the cheap.

Mira was a year older, and left for sixth form at a school that rolled its Rs in a posh way and had a coat of arms with Latin stitched into it. Patsy stayed at hers, local, good in the way of the in-between schools that produced people who worked hard and sometimes found ways to vanish. You could stand on bridge over the train tracks and feel the river of people flood back and forth beneath you in the mornings and say, That’s me. That’s all right. You could decide a thing like that and make it true. Patsy had decided, sometimes daily, that she was all right.

The first time they sat across from each other in real quiet, without parent choreography, it was at the kitchen table after midnight. There had been a row about something practical and stupid—laundry, the share of shelves in the fridge, the price of school shoes, the way two women who had never raised daughters might learn like you learn to ride a new bike by looking at pictures. Anjali had cried in the way she later would deny was crying. Patsy’s father had said her name in the old, stubborn way—Patricia—and left the room because he did not do tears. And then there were just the two of them, calling each other “stepsister” in their heads like an insult and pitying themselves.

Mira had said, “How long do you plan to hate me?” and Patsy had laughed like a dog barks when it is startled, and then they had both started to laugh and could not stop, and it had been like a valve opening in a pressure cooker. Afterwards they had eaten cereal from the box and told each other the stupid things that felt brave to admit: I sleep with socks on. I write sentences on my hand and wash them off on the way home. I hate milk. I don’t trust people with neat handwriting. For once, no one was supervising the trajectory of their joy.

They got older—A-levels, university applications, the misery of UCAS forms, and then the scatter. Mira went to St Andrews. Patsy stayed nearby, did City, then postgraduate, then the long, odd corridor of training that culminated in a job where you saw things you could not describe in casual conversation without changing the mood of a room. In all that, the house remained a place with a calendar, fruit, a radio tuned to old songs, and the ghost of rows. They remained the same, and changed, and like all families built on late add-ons they found a way to say it was fine.

An invitation to dinner sounded like neutrality, but what it meant was this: come and sit at the table with your father and his new wife and the girl who keeps your heartbeat in a foreign pocket. Eat what you are given. Smile like you’ve been fed. Be a child again—no. No, be the adult they need you to be, which is worse.

She wrote back to her father at her desk, after Dr Kwan had left and Lottie had toasted to surviving a Monday with tea, after Mr Ibrahim had returned shyly at the door to ask if she might put his GP’s name on the letter because he could not remember the spelling, after the rubber plant had tipped itself further into its lean.

Friday, yes. I’ll bring a trifle. Or flowers. Or both. Tell Anj I’m requesting the aubergines again. P x

She did not text Mira. She would not text Mira. There was, somewhere, a science to the ratio of wanting and leaving alone. She did not trust herself to do the equation right.

On Friday, Wembley smelled of rain on hot pavement and a faint sweetness from the mithai shop. She bought both trifle ingredients and a bouquet that looked like a crowd—tulips and carnations and two sunflowers that had no business being in February. She trudged to Chaplin Road and stood outside the house that was too small to have held the arguments it had held, and took a breath that did not fill her and went in.

Her father had a new shirt on that made him look like a man who owned a pub. Anjali was in her apron, TV on in the background with a Korean soap no one was following. The kitchen was warm, the kind of wet warmth produced by onions and the steam of a thousand plans. There were cards pinned to the corkboard, all with subtle glitter and phrases like To A Lovely Couple and Family Is Forever. A fruit bowl. A calendar. February had a cow on it. In a corner, Mira leaned against the counter with a glass in hand and a face that made Patsy feel like she had missed an appointment somewhere, a crucial one, hair clipped back, mouth painted in a practical red.

“Trish,” Mira said, as if the word had teeth and she would not be feeding it. “I was almost going to text and then I didn’t. Hello.”

“Hello,” Patsy said, and tried to hold herself in the shape of a sister, ordinary and unsuspicious. “Your hair. It’s shorter.”

“It’s less of a nest,” Mira said, and laughed, and then they did the thing of hugging because Anjali had turned to watch, expectant, and because they were good and could do it. It was nothing, a press of cloth, the neat click of Mira’s bangle against her watch, the smell of something expensive, the flare of a remembered thing that had never been performed out loud. It was nothing.

Dinner was aubergine softened to satin and laddoos that broke into sand under your tongue and rice, every grain a soldier. They spoke about the roadworks by the roundabout and how drivers had started using the side streets and had clipped two mirrors off two cars in two days. They spoke about the factory where Anjali’s cousin worked and how it wanted to automate the part of the job that put stickers on jars, and how this seemed both brilliant and cruel. They spoke about Denton, the old neighbor, who had been seen stroking a cat that was not his. They spoke about the train strikes. They spoke about weather like old soldiers do. The radio smoothed the air under their words.

“What about you, Trish?” her father asked, fork paused, head cocked in the old way he had when he used to ask her a math problem and then pretend to be confused by his own question.

“The usual,” she said. “Monday and Thursday evenings now, which means I get to see the whole city’s melancholy in the flesh. We’re moving the group to Room 5 because the radiator in 3 wheezes like someone sleeping next to you you’ve stopped loving.”

Anjali clicked her tongue, not at the radiator but at the last part of the sentence. She never did know what to do with Patsy’s metaphors. “Are your patients being good?” she asked, and Mira’s mouth tugged into a smile because of course that word, good, was ridiculous here and yet it was what people used when they wanted to cover something tender.

“They’re being people,” Patsy said.

“Meaning difficult,” her father said, fond, because he could not bear the idea of anything being technically unfixable. He was just the same in his bones as he had been when he kept the whole street’s clockwork humming with spanners and gaffer tape.

“Meaning not easy,” she said. “Different thing.”

Mira was quiet in a way that was full of fireworks. She watched the table the way you watch the sea right before it decides about the wave it’s going to send you. “I’m moving,” she said, and swallowed it like a child who has said a rude word. “Well. Possibly. Job in Manchester. They’re opening a new arm of the firm and I—there’s a chance. Not final.”

Her father said, “Manchester!” as though it were foreign. Anjali said, “That is a long way to carry groceries,” which was one of her ways of naming distance. Patsy felt the room tip and settle, like a ship does, and smiled enough to seem to have all her teeth. She saw the arch out the window, just a white curve against a sky that had turned to bruise, and thought, Not final. Not final. There was a sense in which nothing ever was, except the things you didn’t properly look at.

“Congratulations,” she said. “They’d be lucky. We will write you letters about the cat, the roundabout, the price of coriander. We will behave like a classic Greek chorus and curse your choices. It will be picturesque.”

“Sometimes,” Mira said, “I think you’re a bit much.”

“Just a bit,” Patsy said. One bit. Two bits. The whole bit. She sat back. Ate. Took in the map of the table and placed herself on it and tried not to flip it over like a board game.

After dinner, the men disappeared to argue about football in the living room, throwing names like bones. Anjali bathed the serving spoons in hot water. Patsy stood at the sink in the limbo between plates and leftovers and watched the rain slice the light on the road. Mira switched off the extractor fan and the kitchen suddenly had the sort of quiet that reveals everything that isn’t a sound.

“I didn’t text you about the job because I didn’t want to involve the family analysis before I had something that had a shape,” she said.

“I’m very good at analysis,” Patsy said. “It’s what they pay me for.”

“I know,” Mira said, and the word came out as a laugh that was a sob with a wig on. “And I hate it. No, not you. The… you-ness. The way you look at me like I’m a patient even when I’m your step—” She stopped, dragged breath in. “Even when I’m not.”

“Not what,” Patsy said, knowing and not knowing and turning the tap on even though her hands were dry.

“Not an anything you’re allowed to take apart,” Mira said, and set the dishcloth down. “I hate it when you don’t text. I hate it when you do. I hate being here with you in this house with the calendar and the way everything we do seems to run on rails that were laid when we were children. I hate how you make me want to tell you first when something happens because you’ll understand it and I hate how my mother watches you like you’ll grow a tail. I hate,” she said, softer, “how good your hair smells. Like apples. Like school.”

Patsy thought of all the good words. Boundaries. Countertransference. Ethical frameworks. She thought of how, at work, she could talk a person back from a cliff she could only smell and never see, eyes down, voice low, and how, here, there was no script. She turned off the tap and the sound of the water faded the way a room does when a fridge stops humming and suddenly you are aware of the silence that has been hiding behind a sound for years.

“We’re not,” she said, and didn’t know what the next word was. Allowed. Right. Made for it. “I’m not—Mira, listen, we’re not.”

Mira smiled the way people smile when they can feel a glass slipping from their hand and choose to watch it fall in slow motion. “I never told you to fix it,” she said. “I just wanted to say the thing out loud once, where a person would understand the word and not run screaming. I’ll go to Manchester and I’ll meet someone. And I’ll never be back except at Christmas and then it will be fine. It will be an anecdote. We’ll both laugh like we laughed over the cereal. It will be—”

“Manchester is only two hours,” Patsy said, as though math had anything to do with it, as though train schedules could plot rescue. She could feel her hands trembling, minutely, the way a dog twitches in sleep when it runs in a dream.

“Sometimes you’re very literal,” Mira said softly, and this time when she laughed it was true. She took a step closer and it felt like being on a beach when a wave pulls your ankles and the sand goes soft under you and you underestimate how far your balance is willing to shift. “I think about you at odd times. In the queue for coffee. Watching a TV show where someone says something clever and has a screwed up cardigan. In a taxi where the driver plays a song you’d like. Stupid, small things. It’s not a love story. It’s nothing. I’m telling you, so that when it’s not nothing—for a second—you know you weren’t imagining it alone.”

Patsy did not move. There was a scene, years ago, in a French film she had tried to understand with subtitles half-inaccurate, where two women stand in a kitchen and look at each other and the air between them gets so saturated with wanting that it turns visible, like steam. She had thought then, in university, that it was melodrama, that perhaps the French took kitchens too seriously. Here, in Wembley, with the arch outside and the rain slanting and her father laughing in a room away, a kettle ticked as it cooled and she could see the air.

“Mira,” she said, helpless. The name was a reason. Also a prayer.

“Say goodnight to Dad for me,” Mira said quickly, and the wave broke on a shore they did not own, and the sand under their toes set, hard, and that was the moment saved by an interruption because Anjali came back in, tea towel in hand, and said, “Are you two conspiring?” and Mira lifted her glass like a flag and said, “Always.”

Patsy went home carrying the leftover trifle in a Tupperware that had belonged to a woman who used to live two doors down and bequeathed all her plastic tubs to the street like a civic gesture. The rain had gone sideways again and strangers bumped her and she did not mind, grateful to be jostled into the crowd’s hum. When she got to her flat she put the Tupperware in the fridge, took it out, put it in again, laughed at herself, stood with the door open until the light made her shiver and shut it.

She lay on her bed not undressing and stared at the crack in the plaster that looked like a river on a map. You could follow it north to a bend and then west where it fanned like a delta. She told herself a story. She was very good at that. In the story, she and Mira never said anything and then Mira left and married a man who sold antique maps and lived in Didsbury and ran in the mornings and sent photos of mist. In the story, she and Mira said everything and then did something stupid and kept doing it until it stopped being stupid and started being simply an arranged fact, like the calendar on the wall that, in March, would have a pig on it instead of a cow. In the story, all endings were beginnings if you squinted. In the story, time meant well.

At work on Monday, her group met in Room 5, which had a radiator that behaved and a window that showed a sliver of sky and the roof of a supermarket that had an optimistic slogan about freshness. Six people sat, all doing that careful thing you do with your face when you have decided to be brave in public. Mr Ibrahim had come. A woman named Yalda who introduced herself as a person with three sons and a mysterious illness. A man named Ben who wore his hoodie like a fortress. A nurse had put out biscuits with a hopeful flourish and a slide of hand sanitizer because there had been a memo about germs. Patsy sat and the circle closed and opened like a heartbeat. They talked about ordinary things like breathing and unspeakable things like sleeping next to someone and feeling your chest fill with bile. They made the peculiar jokes people in pain make that always sound to outsiders like a code.

Sometimes she told the truth to herself, there in the circle, in a way that surprised her. She said things like, “It’s not your fault that your mind does what it was taught to do to keep you alive,” and “I’m sorry,” and “Let’s try another way.” She said, “I cannot fix you,” and waited, and let it be a mercy. They drank, and the tea was good, because it was hot and sweet and ordinary and full of the past. Lottie peeked in and smiled and mouthed, How are you? and Patsy shrugged because there was no hand signal for the way it felt to carry a secret like a glass of water filled to the lip.

After, she stayed later than she needed to, writing notes with a care that felt like a ritual. She wrote at the top of every page the date like an anchor. She wrote in a handwriting that was only neat if she thought about her primary school teacher holding up examples of tidy cursive like a hope. When she was done and the building made the settling sounds buildings make after a day of absorbing strangers—the creak, the sigh, a thud that could be a door closing or a book giving up its grip on a shelf—she walked out into night.

There was a man sitting on the low wall across the car park, smoking and looking like he’d just been told someone had taken his seat in the world. She knew him only enough to nod. He nodded back, the cigarette a star moving. The arch was visible again, white against a navy sky, indifferent. She had been very careful all her life to be the kind of person who didn’t make a mess she couldn’t clean by morning. The desire to make one anyway ran through her like a river in spate.

She had not touched anything stronger than white wine in months. It wasn’t abstinence as a principle; it was prudence worn like a uniform. The act of being sober was as much habit as virtue. Still. After the job had been nothing but good and her mouth tasted like tea and not enough, she went to the shop on the corner that sold everything—nails, eggs, toys with loose eyes, cigarettes, shampoo—and bought a bottle of something loamy and red. She carried it home like contraband. She did not open it. She put it on the table and looked at it. She poured water. She drank the water like she was proving something to someone who had never been cruel to her except herself. Then she opened the wine and had one glass, then half of the next, then she put the rest in the sink and turned the tap on and watched the red go pink go clear and felt at once both the victor and the fool.

Mira texted at ten. A photo of the arch. A joke: He’s following me home. Her window had the same view at angles where the curve of the metal could be a comma or a scythe. Patsy typed, erased, typed, erased. Finally: That’s his way. His only trick. You home?

Yes.

Good.

Are you— I mean. We’re okay?

We’re always okay, came the reply, and then: Don’t go therapist on me now, Mags.

She lay the phone on her chest and it weighted her. Then she put it on the bedside table with the water glass and the watch and the book she had been trying to read for three weeks that refused to be climbed. Sleep came like it had to be asked twice.

In the morning, the news shouted, the kettle crooked, the post lay on the mat with the shy promise that it sometimes brings something other than bills. It was a letter from a charity she gave to because she had once seen a poster on the tube that had broken her heart with a sentence and a face. She made toast that cooled before she ate it and discovered she did not mind cold toast as much as people say the English mind anything. She went to work. She breathed. She offered herself to other people’s storms and did not drown.

When Mira told her, two Fridays later, that Manchester had finalised the position and receipts were being printed, she was on a bus with a seat that smelled like damp denim. The text read like this: It’s happening. I find myself suddenly tempted by rain that isn’t our rain. Don’t tell Dad yet. I want to do it at dinner. Okay?

Okay, she wrote, because there were only two answers and she did not have the stomach for the other. She thought of all the words that come after okay—then, now, because, but—and did not type any. She watched the city flicker by. A boy with a backpack bigger than his torso; a woman reading a book with cracked spine and a concentration that seemed holy; a man carrying a ladder like a cross, which was probably just a practical errand and not an allegory, but still.

If there was a moment when the inclination in her life wobbled, it was small. It was the size of a new key on a ring. It was the way her hand hovered over the dispenser at the nurses’ station for too long and then didn’t press. It was the second glass of wine after the first had been a neat idea, a bit of punctuation; the way the second came out like a misspelling you allow because you understand the sentence anyway.

Or else it was larger. It was the voice in her head that sounded like someone else’s grandmother hauling her name out of her full syllables—Patricia—and telling her not to be foolish. It was the moment she got home and opened the cupboard where, behind the aspirin and the toothpaste and the roasted sesame seeds, lay the tiny, forgotten bottle of codeine from the time she had a gum operation. It had dust on the cap. She put it on the counter like an old photograph turned face up again. She looked at it for a long while and then she put it back and closed the door and stood with her palms flat on the wood like that could keep the contents inside from knowing she was there.

She called her friend Izzy, who lived in a converted church in Kensal and had a habit of throwing jokes at her like life jackets. “The thing about forbidden love,” Izzy said matter-of-factly, “is that it’s very basic. Human brains love a locked door. They love to pick a lock even when they do not need what’s behind it. Also: have you considered therapy?”

“I am therapy,” Patsy said. She sat on the floor with her back against the bed in the position she used when she was a much younger person and believed in the phone like it could deliver her breath to someone across town.

“Exactly,” Izzy said. “Have you considered other people’s therapy. For you. A professional. Distance. Etc.”

“Considered,” she said. “Avoided. Deliberately. Hypocrisy is the oil that keeps the world going.”

“True. But also: you can do a stupid thing and not do the stupidest thing,” Izzy said, and then she told a story about her ex who had tattooed his own initials on his ankle by mistake and had to live with J.J. for Jonathan James even though his name was Jonathan Joseph, and Patsy laughed long and ugly and the valve that had hissed in her head released a little.

Once, years ago, a man she had loved had said to her, “You can never be in a thing. You always stand to the side and commentate like a sports channel from the nineties.” He had been right. He had also been a bore. After he left, she had practised standing fully inside the room. She had timed herself, counted breaths, practiced being looked at without flinching. She got so good at it that most days she remembered only when she got home and unzipped herself and found the lining of the suit she had worn the world starting to fray.

In March, the calendar indeed had the pig, pink and ridiculous. Mira started packing in small folds, and then, one Friday, in a large rush, because the van had been cancelled and then renewed and suddenly the delivery man had called her “luv” and she had said “cheers” and the promises had become furniture.

Patsy helped because of course she did. The two of them in the flat that Mira had painted three shades of white depending on which way the sun fell. They put books in boxes and argued like loved ones about whether to organise by topic or size and ended up doing both, then neither. They wrapped glasses in old printouts from work and found, while wrapping, sentences that made both of them stop: Do not confuse catastrophizing with prophecy; knowing a harm does not oblige you to endure it; a wish is not a plan; a plan is not a sentence.

“You’re a fortune cookie,” Mira said, waving a sheet like a surrender flag.

“That’ll be my next career. Trish’s Tiny Prophecies. Available in all good takeaways,” Patsy said. “Next to the chilli sauce.”

They stood in the sitting room among boxes and lamplight and afternoon. The light looked like it had been broken and glued back together. Some days, that was all she wanted: the glue. It would not last forever. It would keep the cracks from widening on the bad days. It would explain a fracture by making it sparkle.

“I need you to promise me a thing,” Mira said.

“Impossible,” Patsy said.

“Promise me you’ll not make this into the plot of your life. That you’ll not be tragic in a tidy way about it.”

Patsy made a ceremony of consideration. She walked to the window, looked down at the street, a man in a puffer jacket trying to get a child into a car seat, a woman with hair the colour of singing sending a voice note, a dog that looked surprised by pavement. “I promise to be messy,” she said. “But only slightly. I promise to be only as tragic as a sitcom. The early series.”

“I’ll take that,” Mira said, and came and bumped her shoulder like they were two teenagers and not women who should know better. “I’m leaving the plant,” she said. “You have to talk to it. It’s used to being reassured.”

“No one is used to being reassured in this flat.”

“Then here’s your chance to break a cycle.”

They laughed. The van arrived. The men lifted the boxes like boxes are a thing men pretend to be born carrying. Down the stairs, across the pavement, up again. Patsy handed labels like a quartermaster on a ship no one had taught her to sail. Mira signed papers. Patsy watched her name on the form, just the surname, and felt—what? Not loss. A rearrangement. The trapdoor opening, not to empty but to a different room.

At the bottom of one box, after the van had gone and the room had turned into echo, was a scarf that smelled like winter and a stack of photographs that had not needed to be in a box at all because the images they contained were in all the rooms of her head. The two of them at the kitchen table, cereal. Two mouths, milk. Anjali in the background with her hands on her hips in a posture that had become, in the family, the symbol for We Will Survive This. Patsy with hair that did indeed smell like apples, Mira with a look like she might write a book about the moment. They were ridiculous and earnest and in danger of becoming art. She picked up the photo and put it back down because if she kept it she would start narrating again.

They stood in the empty room. There’s always a bit of theatre at the end. Will you say the dramatic line. Will you not.

“It will be fine,” Mira said.

“It will be something,” Patsy said.

“We’re always okay.”

“We’re always okay,” Patsy said, and the words went into the air like seeds flung into a place where, who knew, maybe they’d take.

They hugged because they were very good. The cloth pressed. The click of metal. The expensive smell. The want. Then Mira took her bag and her keys and the plant she had insisted on giving up because only maniacs think they can keep plants alive in transit. She stood in the doorway and did the thing everyone does, looked at the room like it was a stranger you’ve started to love, and then left.

Afterwards, Patsy stayed in the empty heat, made a list of instructions for the plant and stuck it to the fridge like mockery.

Water, weekly. Talk, daily. Sun, when available. Avoid drafts. Avoid draughts. Remember the Britishness of plants.

She went home and the flat met her with its standard quiet. She looked at her phone and at the cupboard and at her hands. She poured herself wine and then poured it away. She ate cold toast and felt holy. She did not sleep beautifully but she slept enough. In the morning, she put two slices in the toaster and watched the coils glow. She stood very close to the machine’s hum.

When she met Izzy for coffee on Sunday, they sat under a heater at a table that wobbled and played the game with the sugar packets and the napkins to steady it. “Your face,” Izzy said, looking at her as if she’d been hired to do a forensic examination.

“My face is my face,” Patsy said. “I borrowed it from a man in a painting. It looks good on me, don’t you think?”

“You’re doing jokes about art. That’s either a good sign or a siren,” Izzy said. “Take this. As a human thing, not a prescription. Walk home the long way. Buy something stupid and small. Put something in your body that isn’t a law. Call me if you want to set a fire. I have a bucket.”

“A bucket?” Patsy said, half laughing.

“You can smother a lot with a bucket,” Izzy said. “You can also build sandcastles. Choose your own adventure.”

She walked home the long way. She bought a tiny tin of anchovies because they reminded her of a holiday she had once taken to a town in Spain where old women sat on chairs and crocheted weather. She did not even like anchovies. She liked their commitment. She took the bus two stops because she felt like cheating and then got off, feeling scolded by no one. When she reached her door, she realised she had not thought of the cupboard for thirty-eight minutes. She considered applauding herself. Instead she unlocked the door and the plant, on the table, seemed to lean toward her, expectant.

That night, she opened the cupboard and took out the bottle of codeine again. She held it. She set it on the counter. She read the label, the skimpy lines about dosage and don’t and if and contact. She turned the cap, that child-proof grumpy twist, and stopped, and for an obscene second she thought, This is what someone feels, at the edge of a cliff, in the seconds when the view looks like a home, when the wind is singing and all you have to do to be done is lean.

She put it back. She shut the cupboard. She stood there, palms against the wood, as if maybe, if she did that long enough, the cupboard would become a full thing again, a wall, a barrier, not the door to a room whose floor might not hold.

Outside, Wembley’s hum was at its February pitch: people returning home, plastic rustle, someone singing on the street with an open mouth and only half a tune. The arch was a fingernail in the sky. She pushed her head against the cool of the door and whispered, for no one but herself, a sentence that had no glamour but which, said aloud, felt like a bed: Not tonight.

She turned away. Put the anchovies in the cupboard with the sesame seeds, where they looked like a prank. She watered the plant and told it something ridiculous about photosynthesis. She wrote a letter to Mira she did not send. She turned on the radio and let a man with a voice like honey speak about a cricket match in a place she would probably never go. She lay on her bed. She traced the river in the ceiling with her eyes, north, bend, west, delta. She kept her body in the room. She slept. She woke. She did it again.In the weeks after the boxes had gone and the plant found its place on her table like a small, green challenge, the city softened a fraction at the edges. March could do that: a cold that pretended to be warmth, the sky making promises it had no intention of keeping, buds pushing their faces up and being slapped by wind for their trouble. The arch, when she looked up from her steps with a toothbrush still in her mouth, had the pale, fibrous look of a wishbone held up to the light. She kept telling herself to stop granting it symbolic authority. It was a curve of metal with unfortunate metaphoric magnetism, and she was a woman with a job and a plant and a cupboard and a phone that lit with messages from a city two hours north.

The plant drooped on a Tuesday and she knelt beside it as if it were a person who had chosen a dramatic faint. She poked a finger into the soil with a reverence that would have made Izzy laugh and told it solemnly that she knew all about the difficulty of finding a drink and knowing when to stop. When she poured water, it soaked in with a sound so small she imagined whole deserts listening for it. On the note Mira had stuck to the fridge she added, in felt-tip, a line: You are not responsible for the weather, but try a sunny voice. It made her smile and then it made her want to cry, which seemed about right for March.

By the time she reached Park Royal that morning, a gust had rearranged the car park’s litter into a silent carnival. Lottie was already there, hair a storm, baking something in the staff microwave that smelled dominantly of cheese. She lifted her arms in a greeting that was half ballet and half traffic policing. “Bad news, middling news, or news that wraps itself in a cupcake wrapper and pretends to be cheerful?” she asked, as if she were a waitress and Patsy was a regular who liked to pretend she could be surprised.

“Cupcake,” Patsy said, setting her bag down in its usual place like a ritual. “Always start with cake.”

“Room allocations,” Lottie said, sighing. “Someone upstairs has decided the art therapy trolley is antisocial and must be corralled, which means we’ve lost the cupboard in 5 for storage, which means the groups have to love each other more. Also Dr Kwan has made one of his speeches about hand hygiene that had a crescendo.” She waggled her eyebrows. “I could feel his crescendo in my fillings.”

“I love a crescendo before nine,” Patsy said, and thought of her own heart, which seemed, at the oddest moments, to declare crescendos and then retreat as if ashamed. She hung her coat on a hook she always misjudged, made herself tea from the rattling boil of the kettle in the corner, and stood with her hands around the mug like it held civility.

Her Monday group had been good in the way a bruise is good when you poke it and feel the right amount of ache. Today she would have clinics, a slot reserved for a patient from the home treatment team who had fallen through one of the holes in one of the nets, a supervision with a trainee who had the too-open face of someone who had not yet learned the trick of having three layers of expressions ready, and time set aside for admin which would immediately be stolen by something resembling a crisis. The list comforted her in its predictability, the way a weather report comforted fishermen only tangentially.

Before she could settle, the duty phone did its cartoonish quiver on the desk. Lottie grabbed it and put her hand over the receiver like an actor in a bad farce. “For you,” she mouthed, which was already a joke since it was always for someone else until, via the magic of staffing levels and rota gaps, it became for you. “Home treatment. Ben.”

He could have been any number of Bens—there were always three at a time—but this was hers, hoodie like a flag, gaze like he’d learned to see through people so he didn’t have to look at them. “He hasn’t answered since last night,” the voice at the other end said, bored and urgent in the way of people who have learned to ration their affect. “Mum says he left the house when Coronation Street started and didn’t come back. Police are aware. He left his meds. Might be nothing. Might be something.”

“Might be both,” Patsy said, because in her experience those categories had a way of standing on each other’s shoulders. She said the sentences she had learned for such occasions: Let’s coordinate, I’ll call his mum, if he presents to A&E please page me, on my way after clinic if no contact. The choreography was a comfort until it wasn’t. She hung up and dialled a number she now knew by heart, which felt like a small theft, and let the phone ring into a house where she could picture the curtains, the carpet’s insistence on pattern, the kitchen radio left on because people preferred the company of a voice even if it was trying to sell them windows.

Ben’s mother answered breathless, as if the phone had rung downstairs while she was upstairs and this was the most running she had done in a year. She said his name as if by saying it to a stranger on a phone she might be able to conjure him. Patsy listened, made the right sounds, said I hear you with such practiced sincerity that she began to resent the phrase even as she meant it. She wrote down the description of his jacket—green, with a stain that looked like mustard and probably wasn’t—and said she would call back at twelve if there was no news, sooner if there was.

Her first patient of the morning was a woman who had not slept properly in two months and had started to narrate everything she did as she did it, which had made living with her partner an act of endurance. “I am opening the fridge,” the woman said, as if demonstrating for a puzzled child. “I am looking at the butter. I am wondering if that smell is the butter or the way the inside of the fridge remembers its dead.” Patsy admired her prose and prescribed sleep hygiene like she was in a first-year OSCE because sometimes the basics were not a joke. She sent her away with a plan and a name for what felt unnameable and wrote in the notes: voices persistent but content neutral; risk low; suggest CBT-I; review two weeks. Her handwriting, careful in the person’s presence, broke into shrubbery when she was alone.

News of Ben came at eleven-forty-seven via the liaison nurse at Northwick Park, who said he had arrived with a cut on his hand and the indignant air of a man who had been given a story that refused to sit in his mouth. “He told triage he fell,” she said. “He told the SHO he punched a bus stop. He told the HCA he didn’t want to say in case it sounded stupid. The cut looks like glass, not brick.” The nurse lowered her voice into the friendly conspiratorial tone people use when they are inviting you into a kindness. “He asked if you were in. He said the doctor with the hair. I think he meant you.”

There was a selfish joy in the words that she tried to repel and then accepted, because refusing honest joys seemed an aristocratic sin. She took her Tesco salad and her charity-shop scarf and walked across to the hospital, noting the familiar shift in air as she did. A&E had the smell of adrenaline, bleach, and fried food, and the peculiar lighting that made everyone look like their ghost. The waiting room was a seamstress’s basket of humanity: a man with a towel on his head from a head wound that would scar into a story he’d tell with relish, a child in a superhero T-shirt who had vomited in the car and was now exhilarated by his personal fame, a woman looking at her lap as if it had insulted her. She stepped through the door with her NHS lanyard swinging and the guard nodded her through as if he had seen her every day in his dreams.

Ben sat on a trolley behind a curtain that had been pulled most of the way, as if privacy could be editorial. He looked like the same person, which was always annoying in a way. You wanted crises to leave marks so you could call them by name in a line-up. He was picking at the edge of the bandage on his hand and when he saw her he let his mouth twist into the smile teenagers had perfected as a weapon against adults who might care. “Miss,” he said, performing school and rebellion in one syllable.

“Doctor,” she corrected, because she was vain and because he liked the game, and he rolled his eyes with theatricality.

“Doctor then,” he said, and they fell into their rhythm, which was a seesaw in which she had learned not to try to keep her side determinately down. He told her fragments. A bus. A message. A doorway that smelled of old ale and a decision that had leapt into him without rehearsal. He said the word stupid three times and each time she watched it fall out of his mouth and land on the floor with a thud like dropped fruit. She said, “Let’s not call you names. Let’s call the urge what it is. Let’s honour the part of you that dragged you in here. That’s the hero of this story, not the part that does dramatic exits.”

He snorted but she saw the corner of him that blushed to be called a hero. Teenagers were complicated in their simplicity. An SHO with startled eyes appeared and said, “We can glue the cut but we can’t glue the reason,” and then flushed at his own poetry. They sat in the small room where she always felt like she should open a window to let the air out of the words people left there. She asked him if he could get through the next forty-eight hours, if he could let his mother hide his belt, if he would allow the cats to mock him as a sign of life. He squinted at her like she was trying to sell him a time-share and then said, “Yeah, fine,” in a voice that meant I will try, because this hurts, and I hate that you know that.

On her way out, one of the porters said, “Doctor Maguire,” in the tone of a person who liked to practice names. It was someone she knew by face and by the earworm of his whistle, a tune that never resolved. He told her a story about how he had fixed a trolley with a spoon and some tape and how life was basically that most of the time, and she felt, briefly, like hugging him with ferocious gratitude before she remembered that hugging porters in corridors was perhaps not the done thing, and also that she was learning this year to let gratitude sit without needing to be converted into movement.

The dinner where Mira told their father the news of Manchester happened on a Sunday like any other, except for the way the air wrong-footed you if you listened too hard. The radio played a song that had been in fashion when their father was twenty and then again when he was fifty, as if the world had decided to keep re-wrapping the same gifts. The cap of the coriander had cracked and Anjali had tipped the last of it into the sauce with a flourish like a magician grateful they had remembered the handkerchief in the cuff. They had eaten a chicken that had kept the oven busy all afternoon, a salad with pomegranate that looked like it had been attacked with rubies, and chips, because their father refused to believe in a Sunday without potatoes.

Mira said the sentence as if she were giving them a fact about train times. “It’s set,” she said, and their father, who had never learned the art of rearranging his features on command, looked for a second like someone had called his name in a crowd in a way that made his stomach fall through him. Then he nodded and said, “You’ll need a good coat,” as if he had been preparing to make this remark all his life. Anjali asked about the cost of vans, which was her way of asking Are you happy, and when Mira said “It’s work,” she put down her fork and said, “You will be happy because you will choose to be, do you understand me,” and then they both smiled like they had been caught pretending the world had a steering wheel.

Afterward, while the TV murmured something sporty, Patsy went into the kitchen to wash the things that did not fit into the dishwasher and had a brief, irrational desire to break a plate just to see it recognise her mood. Her father came to stand with her, the way fathers do when they suspect that dishes can be used as a cover for politics. He dried with the old tea towel that had baked-in stains she liked to call history and said, “Your sister—” in a voice that stumbled right at the first pronoun.

“Stepsister,” she said, reflexively, because she was a pedant at the wrong times.

“Your—Mira,” he said, rolling her name around his mouth like a sweet he didn’t trust. “You’re all right with it?”

“I am a professional,” she said, aiming for a joke, landing near a plea. “I can name what I feel and then file it under Acceptable.” He looked at her with such old tenderness she almost forgave him every time he had failed to look at her like that at fourteen when the world had been ending because of the wrong brand of shampoo.

“You’re my girl,” he said, which in his language contained apologies and defences and a dozen Hallmark cards he would never stoop to buy. “I worry that the things you do to help other people get in the way when it’s you.”

“They don’t,” she lied gently, because he was a man who could take many truths but not perhaps that one. “I have a plant now. It’s enormous work.”

“Water it from the bottom,” he said, turning practical, because that was how he loved. “You put the pot in the sink and you let it drink up through the holes. That way the roots go looking. Don’t spoil it from the top.” She wanted to tell him he had just told her a parable that could keep her from ruin, but instead she nodded and said, “Yes, Dad,” and the plate in her hand decided against being shattered.

There were weeks that followed that felt like sentences written in the passive voice. Things were done. Letters were sent. The trains were delayed. Somebody took a clipboard and asked a question and then repeated back the answer incorrectly. All the while, she did the work that kept her both at arm’s length from herself and intimately in contact with other people’s seconds-to-midnight. A woman with a voice as soft as lint who could not keep food from feeling like an enemy. A man who wanted to borrow money from the practice because he had convinced himself constitutions could include such a clause and who became offended when told no. A girl with glitter on her cheeks who wanted to die every third day and make friends on all the others. The joke among clinicians, if there was one, was that the world might break you but at least it had the decency to do it in interesting ways.

Some nights she stood with the cupboard door open and spoke to it like a friend she could not decide to invite in. She had not thrown the silly bottle away because throwing it away had layer upon layer of performance in it that she did not trust herself to undertake. It lived there behind the sesame seeds and the anchovies and the tube of tomato paste that had congealed into a comic weapon. On the nights when the need rose in her like something on slow boil, she made tea and then she made another tea. She learned to take showers at peculiar hours as if water could distract the body like a baby. She texted Izzy unintelligible strings of vowels and Izzy texted back pictures of her cat under blankets and once a photo of a bucket with the caption “EMERGENCY,” and she laughed, and the laughter sometimes cut the wire that had been tightening at her throat.

On her first day off after the move, she took a train to a station whose name she liked and walked a canal she had never walked in all her years in London. A heron stood on a barge like a patron saint. A man sat on a bench and fed bread to the water even though a sign asked him not to, and the ducks read the sign even less than he did. She took out her phone half a dozen times and did not send what she typed because the sentences kept turning into analysis as soon as they left her thumbs. Instead she sent Mira a photograph of a brick wall with a poem chalked on it in a child’s hand about a dog that had died and a sunflower that had not, and Mira sent back a picture of a canal with water the colour of a bruise and the caption, “Your twin,” and the ache of tenderness and annoyance braided together in her like something a Girl Guide might tie for a badge.

At Park Royal, the email about a serious incident arrived like all bad emails do, in a font that had never held sorrow before. A patient from a different team, a death described in the passive tense, an invitation to a meeting that would be equal parts forensic and theatre. She printed it because she was old-fashioned and sat with it in her hands like it might unfold further if she warmed it. Lottie came over and put a biscuit on top of the paper like a talisman against bureaucracy and said something innocent, like “Are you all right,” and she said “Yes,” and then more honestly, “I don’t know what that looks like today,” and Lottie nodded, and the nod was an introduction to a silence that could just about hold them both.

The meeting was held in a room that tried to remember to be kind. Someone had put a jug of water on the table with slices of lemon floating like lifebuoys. People used the phrases that kept them from drowning in blame: systemic factors, contributory, learning outcomes, no single point of failure. A woman from the trust with a voice like a nursery teacher ran through guidelines as if they were rosary beads. A man who had been the SHO on call that night looked at his hands almost throughout. Patsy found herself wanting to take each person’s head in her hands and say, “You did what you did, not because you were a hero or a villain, but because you were a person trying to ferry another person across a piece of water with a boat you’d built that morning,” and then she realised she was tired in a place she could not name. Afterward, in the corridor, Dr Kwan stood with his bicycle helmet in his hands like a prop he could not remember where to put, and said, “We’re doing our best,” which was both insufficient and the whole truth, and she said, “I wonder if we could be kinder in the way we fail,” which made him look at her with the respect she wanted and did not like that she wanted.

Her supervisor that week was a woman called Grace who had hands that made you think of harvests and the sort of laugh that had startled birds in it. In supervision, Patsy found herself telling stories about patients that were not about the patients at all, and then, miracle of miracles, found herself telling a story about herself that did not make her cringe with performance. She said, “There is a cupboard,” and then stopped and shut her eyes, because who didn’t have one, and Grace said, “May I ask a question that is rude?” and when she nodded, said, “Does the cupboard feel like a friend because you can control it and not the other thing,” and she said, “Yes,” with such relief that she realised she had, in some corner of herself, been waiting to be rude to herself for months. Grace suggested a name of a person she could talk to about talking and she wrote it down like a recipe and, like all recipes, felt simultaneously soothed and offended by its hope.

She found out by accident that her father had cut his hand on a Stanley knife changing a carpet in the back room because he had said, triumphantly, “They wanted a thousand quid for this and look, I did it for thirty-eight,” and then lifted his palm to show her a bandage that belonged in a cartoon. She took him to the urgent care centre with a sternness that made him laugh in his throat and felt fourteen again for the four minutes it took to be ushered in. The nurse who cleaned his cut did it with such gentleness that it made something old and feral in Patsy unclench. Her father said, “It’s nothing,” in that male way that was both protection and laziness, and they both agreed that the phrase “It’s nothing” could be attached to most of their family history like a logo. Later, when she made him tea, he sat back and winced in the small way that men do when they remember they are finite, and said, “Do they really need you to be doing evenings,” as if the world might rearrange itself if he objected enough. She said yes, and he nodded and then said, “We should go to a match,” as if one form of ritual could compensate for another, and she told him she would try, and then she meant it, which surprised her.

On the Friday after payday, she and Izzy sat in a pub that had decided to be both rustic and modern and did neither fully. The table was sticky in a way that comforted her. They ordered chips and olives in a combination that made them both laugh at themselves and talked about nothing for a long time, which was its own prescription. Izzy told her about a colleague who had walked into a glass door with such grace that everyone had pretended not to see it, and about a plumber who had referred to the pipes in her flat as “religious” because they only worked for reasons known to a higher power. Patsy told her about the man with the spooned trolley and the girl with the glitter and the way in the serious incident meeting someone had said “lessons will be learned” with a straight face, and Izzy mimed slapping them and then sent her the picture of the bucket again and they both laughed so hard the couple at the next table smiled in relief that someone else’s joy had not turned into a fight.

When she got home that night, the plant had tilted toward the small northern light and she moved it gently back to centre like she might a person’s head in a hospital bed. She opened the cupboard and then shut it and then opened the fridge and took out an apple and ate it standing up at the sink like a cliché. She looked at the anchovies and thought about how ridiculous it was, the accumulation of tiny talismans. On her phone, a message from Mira waited, a photograph of a takeout curry in a new flat with blank walls and the caption, “Judged by the naan; verdict: acceptable,” and she felt, in that one second, that she might survive not because of the large, noble decisions but because of the stupid, small ones.

The group on Monday talked about rituals. It was a prompt she was suspicious of because it invited earnestness, and yet they fell on it like birds. Yalda spoke of a cup she could only drink from if she had touched the handle three times with her left hand. Mr Ibrahim spoke about ironing shirts to the same song he had played in the week before his son was born, thirty years ago, although he could not admit to anyone that was why. Ben spoke about a pair of trainers that had once been lucky and now cruel, which made them all nod as if shoes carried more morality than they should. Patsy told them about the way she counted her steps sometimes between the Tube and the barrier and how, for months after her mother had left, she had counted the tiles on the kitchen floor because they behaved, each of them being where it was supposed to be, conducting their frost underfoot. They laughed at themselves and then quietened and she watched their faces move as if lit by a fire. When the hour had rung and they stood to go, Ben lingered long enough to say, “Doctor,” with a question mark he did not deliver, and she said, “Yes,” without trying to be clever, and in the end he said nothing because sometimes that was the best thing to do in a day.

On a Thursday, rain came slantwise all morning and then stopped with a theatrical flourish that felt like an apology to no one. She left the building to walk across to liaison and on the footbridge over the canal she found a teenager leaning on the rail in a position she did not like, the way people lean who want to see if the wind has the strength to hold them up. There was a salty smell in the air that did not belong to that water, and for a second her father’s voice rounded in her: You can taste the salt on a day like this, Trish. Even here. She paused, let the boy clock that there was someone nearby who would notice a sudden movement, and said, “Do you know, ducks don’t actually like bread,” in a voice that had been taught to ask for time by offering absurdity. He looked at her as if she were the inventor of soup and then not, and she stood there long enough for the jogger behind her to huff, and for the boy to adjust his weight the way people do when they have chosen for now to stay. She had done very little. Sometimes that was the whole trick and she resented it for its stinginess. Afterwards, she wrote it down in her head in the ridiculous way she had begun to catalogue the seconds she wanted to survive again later: The boy, the rail, the duck lie, the slow breathing, the way her feet had wanted to keep walking and hadn’t.

By April, the plant had a new leaf that unfurled like a secret teaching itself to be less ashamed. She had kept her promise to book an appointment with the therapist whose name Grace had given her, and had sat in a room that smelled faintly of dust and lemon and told a person with patient eyebrows about things she had not even told herself in the language she used at work. It made a difference in a way she could not quantify, which irritated the part of her that loved graphs. Her father, in the territory of his own stories, found himself breathless on the stairs and agreed to go to a GP in a display of cooperation that made the women in his life look at each other as if a dog had learned to say hello. Anjali bought him a cardigan he would never wear and hung it on the door of their bedroom where he would have to look at it and feel guilty. Mira sent a photograph of a sky from a train with a smear of sunset that looked like a painting trying to be realistic, and attached a voice note in which the sounds of the carriage and an announcement about a refreshment trolley made her voice sound like it was underwater. Patsy listened to it three times, then deleted it, then asked herself why she was policing her own attachments as if they were contraband and not the entire point.

The cupboard did not empty. It did not explode. It did not require the drama she kept training for at its threshold. She learned the small domestic choreography that kept it where it was. She threw it glances like a neighbour who had once been difficult and now was simply a person with a noisy washing machine. She took to making hot chocolate at eleven, the childishness of which felt like a disguise. She took to walking the long way to the Tube to pass the window where a baker put out cardamom buns with a flourish. She let herself listen to the silly podcast Izzy loved about murders solved by incompetence rather than heroism. She said to herself, in bed at night, sentences that were so plain she could have put them on the wall without anyone thinking her dramatic: I have a job. I am loved in singular and complicated ways. I can choose not to open the things that hurt me.

One evening, in a late clinic that had filled with an unholy mix of the hopeful and the furious, a man looked at her with such empty disdain that she felt the air leave her. He said, “You think you can fix me,” and she said, “No,” so fast he blinked. “I cannot fix you and I will not try. I can sit here and not flinch. I can put my hands in the dishwater with you and see what comes up. I can tell you something isn’t your fault. I can prescribe. I can write to people. I can try to keep you safe for a bit,” she said, and when she had finished, he did not soften because why would he, but something in the room rearranged itself into a shape both of them could sit inside without durational pain. Later, when the ward had quietened into the rare hum of nothing happening and Lottie had left her a biscuit with a note saying, “You are an egg,” with a drawing of a smiling egg because Lottie’s metaphors were lawless, she laughed alone and then cried for a minute, which counted as her exercise for the day.

The arch outside went on being the same ridiculously eloquent piece of metal it had always been. Sometimes, late, she would stand at her window and look at it, and it would be a comma, and sometimes it would be a scythe, and sometimes it would be a door left half-open in a house she did not live in. She wished, with the fierce superstition of the hard-headed, that it could be a person who could occasionally be told to stop. Failing that, she learned to nod at it like you nod at an old neighbour you once had a row with and now borrow sugar from. It was not God. It was not fate. It was a thing that sat on the skyline and made its argument, and some days she won and some days it did.

On a night where the rain forgot again and behaved, she came home and found on her doormat a postcard with a picture of a bee on it and the words Manchester Museum looking self-conscious in the corner. On the back, in Mira’s handwriting that had always been both elegant and irritated with the presence of the page, was a single sentence that refused to be dramatic and therefore knocked her sideways. It said: I saw a thing that made me think, not of you exactly, but of the idea of you, and I wanted to tell you because that felt like telling the truth. She put the card on the fridge under the plant note. She looked at it. She did not narrate it. She made tea. She fed the plant. She told herself another of the quiet sentences that had learned, in these months, how to lodge in her like a second pulse. She said: It is not an epic to survive without burning everything down. It is simply a life. Then she went to bed and, despite the part of her that wanted to make a mess worth writing about, slept like someone who had decided, just for tonight, to consider peace.By late April the light learned a new trick and stayed until the evening felt like it had been stretched on a rack. The plant on her table delivered, shyly, a second new leaf, unfurling with the deliberation of an old man opening a newspaper. Patsy praised it as if it had passed an exam, then laughed at herself because there was no exam, there was only persistence. The calendar had a lamb on it that looked more like a cloud had been given legs, and she drew a star on the Friday where Grace had circled, in discreet therapist script, the words Do a thing for joy that is not secretly about work. The instruction had taken up residence in her head like a guest with too much luggage. She had considered baking, and then had remembered she only baked when someone was ill and she wanted to accessorise care. She had considered swimming, and then had remembered there is something about a pool that turns her into a list of failures in a humourless bullet journal. She had considered buying a new pen, and then had admitted that the note of procurement in that thought made it sound like filing.

Her father solved the problem by ringing and saying, as if it were the most natural sentence in the world, “I’ve got two for Saturday,” and then waiting for her to understand. She could see him in her mind, the way he stood by the back door with phone to ear and one hand on his belt as if conversation was a thing that required anchoring. He said, “Play-off, not league, don’t ask me to explain, your Uncle Raj dropped out because his knee thinks it’s a weather station, I told him he could watch the highlights and pretend,” and she said yes before she had time to organise a grown-up calculus of claims on her time.

On Saturday, Wembley tasted like what he had always said it would: salt in a place where no sea ran, grease hanging in the air like nostalgia, a spice you could only half name because it had been changed by wind and the breath of people saying the same words at the same time. They walked along the road in the tide of scarves and plastic horns and shirts with names across the shoulders like incantations, and her father looked at the stands like a man meeting a celebrity he had once written a letter to. The arch was a nail paring against a sky too blue to trust, and she could not help it; she looked up for too long, letting the white curve pass across her retina like a sentence she needed to reread to be sure of its syntax.

Anjali had packed sandwiches wrapped in foil and put two folded napkins in the bag as if she did not believe the modern world had solved the napkin crisis. “Don’t buy a sausage that looks like it could outlive you,” she had said, pressing the bag into Patsy’s hands like a pact, and then kissed her husband at the door with that fierce little peck that married couples achieve, the one that says, I will not grandstand about devotion, it is a job, it is done. They were early enough to watch the stadium fill and late enough not to have to listen to the man on the tannoy attempt to make song into propaganda. Her father found their seats with the confident swerve of someone who believes in numbers on aisles, and then stood and sat twice in quick succession as he misread his own enthusiasm.

The crowd had the kind of mood you get on a bank holiday when rain threatens but does not deliver. People said hello with their elbows. A child behind them kicked Patsy’s chair rhythmically as if he had been trained by a metronome, and she told herself a story about mothers, patience, and the necessity of the gods of percussion, and chose not to turn around. Her father began to tell her about a game in 1997 he had once half-invented in his retellings, and she did not correct him even on the detail she had once corrected him on as a teenager to prove she was not paying attention. She craned forward, shoulders hunched in the manner of those who believe their bodily angle will change the outcome, and let herself be the kind of person who shouts, which is a pleasure she had denied herself out of a sense of professional decorum even when no one from work could possibly hear.

At half-time she stood in a slow queue for tea that looked like a study in British national character. The woman in front of her had brought a handbag worthy of a gala and took from it, with solemnity, a Ziploc with cut-up mango which she ate with a fork she had also brought, and Patsy loved her for it with an absurd loyalty. The man behind her was telling his friend about a knee that had weather reports in it, as if the entire nation had been built on joints that believed in clouds. She turned back to the pitch and thought, not of work, not of the cupboard, but of a girl who had stood in this same place and thought herself the only person in London whom no one would consider the protagonist of a story, and she wanted to pat that girl on the shoulder and tell her that not being the protagonist was sometimes the whole point.

It happened, as these things do, in the moment after a joke. Her father had just leaned in to say that the man two rows down had the wrong scarf for the team he was pretending to love, and then he stopped mid-lean and put his hand flat on his chest as if pressing an invisible elevator button. He did not make a sound, which scared her more than any dramatics would have, and his face lost and regained colour in the time it takes a sound to leave a throat. She said his name the wrong way, sharply, and he said, “It’s nothing,” with a brightness that tried to outpace the truth. The second time he pressed his palm there was a tremor in his fingers that had not been invited, and the sound in the stadium shifted, imperceptibly, as if it had moved an inch to the left and left them in a minor key.

She did not stand up and shout for a doctor because she knew too well what panic did to a person in a sea of watchers, and because she had the number in her head of how many seconds it takes to bring oxygen to a thought. She put her hand on his wrist, as if taking a pulse was still a romance and not a measurement, and the small part of her brain that remained an instrument counted and told her a story she did not like but could work with. The stewards appeared in that polite way of people who do not want to be in your photograph and were suddenly saints because they moved with purpose and said words that opened doors. A paramedic whose face had the calm of someone who had seen the inside of too many Saturday nights rested a hand lightly on her father’s shoulder and spoke to him as if he were an old friend who had arrived late to a party but was still welcome. Patsy said, because she could not not say it, “He’s had some breathlessness on stairs,” and the paramedic nodded without surprise, and then they were moving and she was moving and the air turned into that thin kind that hospital corridors cultivate like a plant.

Northwick Park greeted them with the same peculiar charity it offered everyone, the doors yawning as if exhausted by their job of opening to strangers’ trouble. She became two versions of herself at once, the daughter who could not stop saying Dad, and the doctor who knew how to agree with a registrar without giving them more reality than they had. Anjali arrived with her hair hastily pinned, an expression that tried to keep her face from falling off it, and a bottle of water in a bag so heavy it seemed she was camping. “I told you not to eat a sausage,” she said to her husband in a voice no one else was meant to hear, and then they both laughed because jokes are rafts and sometimes those are all you get.

She called Mira because not calling would have been an act of cruelty dressed up as stoicism. The phone did that modern thing of not ringing but thinking, and she could see the cartoon dots of someone typing before the line connected and the breath of the train filled the space between them like an ocean. “I’m on my way,” Mira said, not bothering with questions because questions are often about the person asking them, and Patsy closed her eyes for a second because relief is a body event and you might as well respect it. When she opened them, they were in a bay where curtains tried to be walls and machines hummed in the key of the worried. Her father lay on a bed with wires attached to him like telephone lines in an old film. He rolled his eyes when she picked up one of his hands and said, “I’m fine,” and she said, “That is not your line in this scene,” and he did not know whether to be offended or comforted and so settled for both.

Hospitals have a smell that changes depending on what you need from them. Today it smelled like floor polish, rubber, and not quite enough coffee. A nurse whose arms looked ready to carry furniture took Anjali’s details with the gentle authoritarianism of someone who had spent their life making sure that forms did not end up as paper boats in a puddle. An SHO with a face too young for the gravity in it asked her father questions in a voice he had probably practised to make older men comply. They said things like “a small event” and “markers” and “admission for observation” and Patsy nodded as if she were hearing a lecture she had attended at the back of the room so many times she could recite it forwards and back. There was an absurd comfort in being offered an armchair that had known more bottoms than lovers and in being told she could make tea, and she put the kettle on like she was making magic.

When Mira appeared, she had her laptop bag still across her body like a diagonal shield, and a face that looked as if she had been running inside it. She did not speak for a second and in that second they looked at each other with such nakedness that it felt indecent, and then Anjali said, “Your father is being stubborn,” and Mira smiled, the kind of smile you give a stranger in an airport that temporarily offers you your nationality back. They found a bench together in the corridor that had been designed by someone who had never tried to sleep sitting up, and they sat and watched a family navigate their love with plastic bags and a blanket. Patsy put her hand on the bench on either side of her thighs and felt the cold of it come up into her palms, and she thought about all the benches in the world that had been asked to hold a weight beyond their specification.

On the hour that people always choose for confession, Anjali left to argue with a vending machine and her father fell into a small sleep with a mouth open enough to make him look like a boy, and Mira said, without preface, “I thought I would be brave about this,” and then stopped and shook her head because bravery is one of those words that collapses if you look at it too long. Patsy wanted to inventory things to save them both, to say, I have brought sandwiches and data, I have a plan for the night and a plan for the morning, I have a joke, I have a way of sitting that makes coffee taste like an event, but what she said was, “He’ll be okay,” and heard her own voice as if it were being piped from another room, where they were doing a better job at being a person.

They did the practical things that anchor you to the day. They took turns going to the bathroom and reporting back on the state of the soap, which was an absurdly intimate detail that meant nothing and everything. They counted how many nurses wore their hair in plaits and decided it was a sign of competence. They agreed to text Izzy a version of events that landed on the comfortable side of dramatic, because Izzy would arrive with a bucket if asked and that would be both wonderful and chaos. They took the cups that had been too hot and then cooled too quickly and drank anyway and made faces like they were being punished for generosity. Anjali came back with a Snickers that had got stuck and then surrendered with a crash so loud it made two people laugh in sympathy and a third person cry, and they shared it like a sacrament, the cutting done with a plastic knife that had ambitions above its station.

It turned out to be what the doctors said it was, a small thing with big implications, an event that one day would give her father a sentence he could use to refuse to climb ladders and to make a case for a nap to no one in particular. He was admitted for the night and then for one more night because it made everyone feel as if prudence had been paid its due. In the morning, the consultant came with hair that betrayed a helmet and a smile that had been taught to under-promise, and he offered the version of reassurance that comes with leaflets. Anjali nodded in that way that peoples the air with prayers you can almost hear, and Patsy said thank you with such ferocity she saw the consultant take a microscopic step back as if he had been caught receiving a compliment at the wrong angle. Her father made a joke about hospital gowns that did not land because the universe does not favour garment comedy, and then attempted to sit up with his usual verve and reminded them all that bodies do not like to be rushed when they have freshly been reminded of the finite.

The world went on outside in the obscene way it does when you are needed by your own life and someone else holds your heart. Lottie sent a picture of a biscuit shaped like a paracetamol and wrote, “It’s a sign,” and three exclamation marks, and Patsy wrote back a doctorish paragraph and then sent a heart because she had learned that as a language. Dr Kwan wrote, “Don’t be here. Be there. The river of admin will still be flowing when you return,” and attached a photograph of his bicycle under a tree and she wanted to tell him—earnestly, a sin she forbade herself at work—that this was the kindest sentence anyone had offered her that week. Mr Ibrahim, who had somehow got wind of her absence because the world of ill and well is a sieve, left a message with reception that said, “Tell the doctor with the hair that I send prayers,” and she put her head down on a table in such a way that a nurse thought she had fainted and came to pat her shoulder.

In the evening, after the second day, when he had the colour of himself again and had managed a mean joke about hospital jelly, they were permitted to take him home. The car smelled of the kind of tired that is also relief and of the supermarket flowers Anjali had placed on the back seat as if reward were a thing you should buy in advance. He shuffled across the threshold like the Pope and then insisted on making his own tea, and Patsy watched him and let him, because there are rituals you do not steal even if you have a medical degree and a plan and a therapeutic manner. When he sat, he said, as if picking up a conversation from another year, “You water from the bottom,” and she said, “I know,” and he looked at her like he was not just talking about the plant.

Back at her flat, later, when the adrenaline had gone somewhere else to be useful, she stood with the cupboard door open as if it were the only window left in the room. The little bottle sat in its place like a joke about scale, the kind of thing you might buy in a vending machine on a bad sitcom. She put her hands flat on the painted wood in an attitude that would have looked like prayer to a stranger and said, quietly enough to make her smile at her own theatre, “Not today,” and then she said, because repetition sometimes makes a thing true, “Not tonight,” and then, because she suspected she would need a new sentence soon, she added, “Not for this,” and shut the door with a gentleness that surprised her. She made cocoa at eleven like a child, put a blanket over her legs like a grandmother, and wrote to Grace a message that was the bravest thing she had done all week not because it contained confession but because it contained an unadorned truth. She wrote: I did not fix it. I sat. I made tea. I asked for help. I survived the hours where I wanted to be spectacular. It was enough, and I hate that it was enough, but here we are.

Ben texted her a photograph the next morning of a blurry screen from a sports channel where the crowd panned past and two heads, hers and her father’s, made a cameo as anonymous as weather. He had circled their heads in red on his phone and put, “Lol,” which is the nearest a teenage boy can get to saying I am glad you exist. She wrote back a thumbs up and then a sentence she had practised: See you Monday, clinic as usual, and he replied with a skull emoji and a football, which she had learned meant something like Yes and No and This is ridiculous and I hate that you are right.

The following week had the particular brightness of days that have been borrowed off fate. Her father was tiresome and good, turning his convalescence into a theatre of unwillingness. Anjali became a tyrant about salt in a way that would make a feature-length film only in France. Patsy made soup because it seemed ordinary and that was what she craved, and she carried it over in old plastic tubs that had seen many soups and one notable attempt at a curry that had stained them in a way that felt like a family tree. She sat at the table with them and did not enforce clinical metaphors on the conversation, and watched, with awe disguised as banter, as the people who had made her navigated a new set of rules with the same mixture of competence and comedy that had seen them through boilers and funerals and chairs with loose legs.

In supervision, Grace asked her about joy as if it were a patient and needed a care plan. Patsy resisted the urge to turn the conversation into an artful essay and said instead, “I went to a match,” and watched as the half-smile in Grace’s eyes widened and then softened because Grace knew, or guessed, that the match had come with a cost and a gift. They talked about benches and vendings machines and the way people sleep with their mouths open when they have finally let go of the mask they wear for the world, and the fact that Patsy wanted to stroke her father’s hair from his forehead like he was a sick child and also never to touch him at all because the intimacy made her feel like a burglar. Grace said, “What do you do when there is nothing to do,” and Patsy said, “I keep count of the tiles,” and they both laughed because the image was too old now to be tragic.

Work resumed its second-best rhythm. The group met and Mr Ibrahim wore a shirt ironed to such perfection that she would have paid money to watch the hour he had spent on it, and he spoke about sitting with his wife and not telling her about an ache because he was bored of being the person with the ache, and it was a confession so ordinary it felt revolutionary. Yalda announced that fasting was a negotiation with her mind, and described how she whispered to herself at four in the morning as if she were a child and her own mother, and the room, in its beautiful, secular way, bowed to the holiness of hunger made into choice. Ben said nothing and then handed her a folded piece of paper at the end of the session that, when she got back to her office and opened it, said, “U were on TV,” with U underlined twice, and a crude drawing of a TV with her hair inside it like a sun, and she put the paper in the drawer where she kept small proofs that the world sometimes threw you gifts disguised as graffiti.

Lottie became, briefly, the centre of a domestic drama when her son announced he had no intention of going to a school he had previously chosen because he had discovered the canopy in the atrium was “performative.” Patsy nodded along in the staff room and offered the kind of condolences you give the parent of a new radical, and Lottie ate a doughnut with such focus that it felt obscene to watch and said, “He wants to stage a protest about rhubarb in the canteen,” and Patsy said, “He’s not wrong about rhubarb,” and Lottie said, “Don’t you dare side with the enemy,” and they both laughed enough to earn the attention of the man from finance who had come to deliver a lecture about codes and deadlines and appeared to be conducting a survey on how many people in the building remembered their passwords.

She went to see her father on a Thursday afternoon that smelled like rain that had missed its appointment. He was wearing a cardigan that had clearly lost the battle in the night against his sense of himself, and Anjali had agreed to leave it on him because the battle was not about cloth and sometimes you give a man a win for free. He tried to tell the story of the small event without the glamour the word threat would lend, and Patsy watched him carefully as if she could calibrate the dosage of his own narrative. He said, “I’m fine,” only twice, which was improvement, and then said, “I saw the arch through the ambulance window and it was ridiculous,” and she loved him so much in that moment for refusing to give the arch agency that she poured him more tea like it was a medal.

At home, the plant sagged a little because the world had too much human drama in it to remember soil. She put the pot in the sink like a child in a bath and let it drink from the bottom as instructed, and while it did, she wrote on small slips of paper, because sometimes the old tricks are the best, a set of words she promised not to say aloud unless asked. She wrote: Manchester; Cupboard; Arch; Dad; Mira; Enough, and tucked them under the top layer of earth as if planting onions in March. It was not magical. It made no difference in the physics of anything. It made her smile and feel like a thief whose theft harms no one.

On a day that presented itself as ordinary and then politely stepped back to let the extraordinary cut the queue, she was called to the ward because a man had decided to leave via a window that had no business being a door. The choreography of fright kicked in with a grace that always shocked her later when she had time to praise it. Nurses approached with voices borrowed from children’s television. A woman from OT produced a packet of crisps as if it were an ethical bribe. Patsy came in with her face set to Not Missing a Beat and found the man not yet at the edge but in the mood for it, which is often how these things present. She said his name as if it were the name of a dog you want not to run into the road, and he looked at her with the ancient contempt of the truly tired. She told him a lie about ducks and bread and it worked again for the three minutes she needed it to, because you collect your lies like tools and use them only in emergencies. Later, in her office, she pressed her thumb and forefinger to the bridge of her nose as if trying to push a headache back into the cupboard that had served it, and Lottie put a biscuit in front of her and said, “Eat,” with the voice of a person who had left softness as a hobby and adopted it as a trade.

Mira sent a postcard that had the picture of a bee and the words Manchester Museum in a font that seemed embarrassed to exist, and it lived on her fridge under a magnet shaped like a chilli. It read, in Mira’s irritated-angel script, “I saw a fluorspar crystal that looked like a slice of sky pretending to be rock. It was ridiculous and moving. This is a thing you would say. Consider yourself told.” Patsy leaned her head against the cool door and laughed because the word ridiculous had, between them, become a term of endearment. She wrote back on a card she had been saving for a more dramatic occasion, a photograph of a zebra crossing with footprints of a cat painted cheekily across it, and wrote, “The plant pretends to be brave every morning. Today it was true. I pretended to be brave in a window. Today it was true enough.”

She slept, on the nights after sleep came back to her like a reasonable friend, with the radio on low, a man with a warm voice telling her about sports played in other countries by men whose names she would never pronounce correctly. She decided not to throw the bottle away and promised herself not to consecrate it with meaning it did not deserve. She put it behind the sesame seeds like a problematic cousin seated at the back of a wedding, in sight if necessary, far from the wine. She practised what she told other people as if they were difficult yoga positions: You can let an urge be a thing that passes through your body without calling it your name. She washed the mugs at work with too much attention to the sound of the water. She did not make a mess that could not be cleaned by morning, not because she was noble, not because she was cowardly, but because for now the part of her that wanted to watch the fire burn enjoyed, perversely and fully, the small rebellion of a life lived without spectacle.

On a Sunday, she walked with her father past the market where a man sold tubs of spices that stained the air with yellow and a woman argued, with beauty, about the price of okra. He walked slower than he had in the winter, and held her elbow in a way that made the two of them look like a pair of dancers from a school play about the war. He told her the story of meeting Anjali again as if some of the details were new to him, and she listened with a kind of relief, the relief of hearing a music you have known all your life and finding a new note in it. He said, “Your mother loved loud colours and hated the rain,” and Patsy said, “I do not remember the colours,” and he said, “That is all right,” and she believed him.

In May, the arch looked like a bow pulled back by a hand too big to see. She stood at her window and watched it as if it might, one day, finally explain itself. She turned off the radio and heard a quiet that was not an accusation. She typed Mira a message that was simple and unshowy and had no words in it that could be mistaken for metaphors. She wrote: I saw a heron on the canal. He stood like a man waiting for someone who is late and is deciding to forgive them this once. It made me think about waiting without turning it into a story. I am trying. When the reply came, an hour later, it said: Trying is the story. Keep going. And there, in the room with the plant and the cupboard and the lamp that flickered only when she needed drama the least, she let those words sit in her mouth like a mint that would not melt, and did the next small ordinary thing, which, as it turned out, was to fold laundry with an attentiveness that would have embarrassed saints.

The next time she walked into the hospital at night, a girl in a yellow coat was crying quietly at a vending machine because it had stolen her coins. Patsy helped her, not because she believed in the machine’s moral improvement but because sometimes returning a chocolate is a way of convincing a person that the world can be coaxed. The machine obliged with the reluctant clunk it keeps for such occasions, and the girl looked at her as if she had produced a rabbit from a hat. “You’re a doctor,” she said, in the way of people who can smell jobs, and Patsy, who was off duty and whose lanyard was in her pocket, considered lying and then decided that, this once, she could take the compliment without paying tax on it. “Sometimes,” she said, and the girl nodded gravely as if that were a profound statement about identity and then left with two Mars bars, one for luck. Patsy watched her go and thought about the units of help she believed in now, their smallness, their faithfulness, their refusal to be epic. She lifted her eyes to the white curve on the horizon and decided it could be punctuation, not a scythe, a mark that did not threaten to cut a sentence off but promised a clause would continue, which was, today, as much theology as she could handle and all the hope she required.By early June the light arrived indecently early, peeping under the curtains as if it had found a way around locks, and the city took on the smell of things warming before they were ready. In the mornings, Patsy brushed her teeth while looking at the plant as if it might offer an opinion on her day. Two new leaves had unfurled, glossy as promises, and she had begun to greet them as if they were colleagues in the corridor. “You’re doing very well,” she told it one Tuesday, and the sentence landed in the room with a weight she was not expecting, so that she had to sit on the arm of the sofa for a second and swallow. The postcard on the fridge held steady, the bee cheerful in its ignorance of their human dramas, and the note about watering from the bottom had become both horticultural advice and a proverb she was trying, with mixed success, to live by.

Her father had made a theatre of recovery that involved stubbornly hanging washing and being caught by Anjali with her hands on her hips, the tea towel over her shoulder like a sash that conferred authority. He went to cardiac rehab sessions at the hospital and returned with a new lexicon—resistance bands, cool-down, target heart rate—that he used with a boyish pride that made Patsy want to kiss his forehead and also forbid him from learning any more. When she visited, he would sit in the chair by the window like a monarch and report on neighbours as if running a small intelligence agency. “Khan from number twelve is definitely moving a woman in,” he said one afternoon with relish. “She has a toaster that looks expensive. And Denton’s cat,”—here he paused for emphasis—“has chosen our garden as a litter tray like the cheeky bastard he is, and I will not be moved on this.” Anjali had rolled her eyes and then said, “I will speak to it,” and they had all laughed because the sentence had made a strange kind of sense.

At Park Royal, the corridor fan that never worked had started to turn like a miracle granted by an electrician on a good day, and a poster appeared on the staff noticeboard with a font that had ideas about fun. Staff Summer Social, it announced, with a photograph of a barbecue that looked as if it had been assembled in a lab. Lottie circled the word “social” in green pen and wrote beneath: “Interpret broadly,” and for the rest of the week people added annotations until the poster had the air of a school textbook that had passed through three generations. Dr Kwan, whose crescendo had become a running joke, was disappearing for two months on a secondment to somewhere that had the word “innovation” in its title, which made everyone assume he would return with a bigger bike and a new way of pronouncing the word “data.” His replacement, on paper, was called Dr Archer, a name that made Patsy think of salmon and rugs. He arrived on a Wednesday with hair that had made decisions and a way of standing that suggested he had once been told he took up too much space and had built himself a posture to answer the charge. He was older than her by a decade and had the careful courtesy of someone who had been widowed young and learned to manage other people’s discomfort about it. She liked him immediately because he did not hide behind his pens; he simply put them in a row and used them.

The complaint came on a Thursday morning with the nowhere smell of toner and the bureaucratic rhythm of a letter written by committee. It addressed her as Dear Dr Maguire and then used the same name like a cudgel. A patient she had seen briefly at liaison three months ago—a man who had come in with a chest of moths and left with a plan and a referral that had, as plans sometimes do, fallen apart—had taken his life in a garage she could see if she pressed her face against the bus window and looked down the row of back gardens on the way to work. The letter did not say garage. It said “a location not far from his home address.” It did not say anything about moths. It said “no known risk at the time of assessment.” It asked for a response within fourteen working days and a reflective piece in which she might consider “learning outcomes” and “future mitigation,” and it managed, in four paragraphs, to be both accusatory and void. She read it in the office while Lottie stirred tea in a mug that had said World’s Best Mum and now said World’s Be Mu because the dishwasher had had opinions. “You okay?” Lottie said softly, because anyone in this building could smell a complaint the way dogs smelled thunder. “No,” Patsy said, and then, with an honesty that startled her, “I will be,” and Lottie did the thing she did best and put three biscuits on the desk in a row like a donation and then turned back to her computer because she knew when not to narrate.

It scraped at her for the rest of the day, that letter. She took it with her into clinic and it sat quietly in the top drawer like a bad fairy. She met with a man who wanted to know if his anger was a personality trait or a weather system and she said, “Can we call it a visitor,” and he laughed like she had given him a pet he might not have to feed. She saw Yalda, who told her with extravagant exhaustion that she had survived Ramadan like a woman negotiating with her own interior parliament, and that Eid had involved sweets that made her teeth feel like they were lined with crystals and joy she did not trust. She listened and said “Tell me about the joy you do not trust,” and watched as Yalda’s face rearranged itself in the secret way people do when you have asked them a question they have been waiting to answer without being sure they had permission. She made notes in her careful handwriting and then, at lunch, took the letter out again and found herself writing a reply that had nothing to do with the trust template. It began, “I am sorry your son’s mind did what it had learned to do to protect him, and that my hands were not enough,” and it continued, in frank, rounded sentences, all the things she could not say in the official version about systems and corners and the way a person can slip through three hands without anyone dropping them. Then she folded that letter and put it in the bottom of her bag like contraband that could not make anything better but needed to exist for her to go on.

Grace looked at her across the small table on Friday and said, “We can write two letters,” which made Patsy blink because she had not told her about the extra sheet in her bag, and then she remembered that part of supervision’s sorcery was guessing which door you were standing behind. She told her about the garage she could see from the bus and Grace nodded as if the street map of West London lived in her somewhere like an extra organ. “What do you do with the regret,” Grace asked then, not the kind of question a person who wants to tick a box asks, and Patsy found herself telling the story of a man years back who had said Thank you for nothing; you were the only person who didn’t try to fix me and how she had carried that sentence like a nettle. “I water it from the bottom,” she said, surprising herself, and Grace laughed, the startled-bird laugh, and said, “Of course you do,” and then asked in a tone so light it might float, “And the cupboard?” and Patsy told her the truth, which was that the bottle still lived behind the sesame seeds and the anchovies like a sleeping cat, and that this week she had been more tempted than she had in months and had opened the door and put her hands on the wood and said a small, ridiculous litany. “Not tonight,” she admitted, half embarrassed. “And then, when that felt like I was being melodramatic about the calendar, I tried ‘not for this.’” Grace sat back with the look of someone watching a child get to the end of a balance beam without falling and said, “We can expand the vocabulary as needed,” and they both smiled because the sentence felt like a plan.

Manchester got hot before London did, or that’s what Mira said, sending a photograph of a fan on a chair like a sculpture and a long message about a woman at her office who had brought tupperware with cut celery and peanut butter for lunch and looked as if she had cracked life. There were days when their messages kept to the trivial because the trivial was the middle ground they could stand on without slipping, and then there were nights when the dots appeared on Patsy’s phone as if someone were doing Morse code from a ship. On one of those nights, late, the phone vibrated with a voice note that she did not open immediately because she had learned that hope likes to be courted. When she pressed play, Mira’s voice came through tired and a little hoarse, the sound of trains in the background pretending to be rain. “I saw a couple holding hands in the supermarket in the aisle with lightbulbs,” Mira said, and already Patsy was smiling because only a person paying attention would notice that people chose lightbulbs as a romantic landscape. “They were not young, and they were not playing at anything. They just had their fingers interlaced like the simplest, bravest act I’ve seen all month. I thought about the way we count brave. I thought about how sometimes I am unfair to the world because I want it to give me fireworks and it gives me this, and maybe that is all right. That’s all. It’s nothing. Goodnight, Mags.” Patsy listened twice in a row, and then she put the phone down face-up on the table like a candle in a church, and went to bed and slept in a way that felt like choosing to float rather than drown.

Ben ghosted clinic for two weeks and then turned up on a Monday afternoon with a haircut he’d clearly given himself and eyes with that glittering defiance that meant something had snapped and been taped back together with gaffer. He sat down and put his hands under his thighs like a boy and made faces at the radiator for a full minute before he was ready to look at her. “I went to a thing,” he said finally, as if confessing to a mild theft, “and I didn’t take anything, like you said, and it was sh—, it was rubbish, and then I did, and it was better, and then it was worse, and then I came home and punched a wall because I thought that would make me a person again.” She didn’t tell him the obvious truths about biochemistry. She didn’t tell him anything he could find on a poster in a GP surgery. She said, “So let’s put ‘I went, it was rubbish, then good, then worse’ on a loop and decide which part we want to stop at next time and what we need to make that plausible.” He looked at her as if she had ruined his plan to be told off. “What do you want, Doctor,” he asked, a trap and a plea in one sentence, and she said, carefully, because he would smell a sermon, “For you to stay alive long enough for the things you want to change shape.” He laughed without mirth and then—this was the victory she would not write on paper—nodded once, as if conceding that the sentence had at least not offended him.

Mr Ibrahim came to group in a shirt the colour of the inside of a mango and told them he had gone to Friday prayers and, for the first time in months, had not cried. He said it like a confession, and the circle of faces looked toward the floor in that respectful way people do when touching someone else’s private victory. Yalda brought in a tin of biscuits with a ribbon around it and put it in the middle like an offering, and when Ben reached for a second one without thinking, she slapped his hand and he grinned at her as if they were family. These were the moments that made Patsy feel she was sitting in a warm kitchen in a house she had earned, and then the duty phone would rattle across the desk and the world would remember itself and she would be reminded, sharply, that you could not collect these and present them to a coroner or a commissioner as proof that the work mattered.

On a Saturday when London pretended to be Barcelona for four hours, she took a train north. It was partly a dare she had set herself and partly the reflex of a person who had been waiting at a bus stop for too long and was tempted to walk just to feel the pavement changing under her feet. Mira met her with the specific joy of greeting someone you had not authorised to be missed and took her down Oxford Road where students had made the pavements look young. The flat was smaller than Patsy had pictured, and whiter—the three shades of white now two—and the windows, which she had been told were optimistic, did their best. She saw herself immediately, the way ghosts do, reflected in a framed print of a bee on a flower by a painter who had achieved something simple and therefore rare, and she wanted to laugh because the city was in on the joke.

They put a bookshelf together with the kind of dignity reserved for operations and they did not, at any point, touch except to pass the Allen key back and forth the way children pass notes. They ate chips from a place Mira insisted on because the batter had the right accent, and they sat on the floor because chairs felt like a performance, and they watched a sports round-up that included a clip of the arch and said nothing about it. It was all wrong and it was all right. There was a moment when the speech about What We Are Not was a current in the room, invisible but powerful, and then the kettle boiled in a silly little rev and saved them both. “Teabags are upstairs,” Mira said, and Patsy found herself running her hand along the banister like she could read a house’s palm, and on the landing she saw, on a small table, a bowl where someone had, without thinking, dropped keys and coins and a shopping list that said milk, coriander, tape and she felt a ridiculous love for the ordinary because it does not ask you to decide if you deserve it.

She slept in the spare room under a duvet that had aspirations of hotel and counted the dots on the ceiling like stars the council had installed. In the morning, when they stood on the small balcony with coffee, Mira said, “I think the bees are winning,” pointing at a planter where something had chosen to flower in defiance of the wind. “I think you should not have bought cheap compost,” Patsy said, without thinking, and then they both looked at each other and grinned because this, apparently, was intimacy now: unsolicited horticulture critique at ten in the morning. At the station, as the announcer made the ritual threats about unattended bags, they hugged in the way you hug someone who will go on existing whether you hold them or not. “We’re okay,” Mira said into her hair, and Patsy found that the sentence was both true and not the point.

Back in London, the letter to the trust became an object she pushed around her desk like a bishop on a chessboard. In the end she wrote two versions as Grace had predicted, and sent the one with the correct phrases and put the other in a drawer and closed it as if putting a child down for a nap. She got an acknowledgment from a woman who wrote “kind regards” with a full stop instead of a comma, which made her feel unreasonable dislike, and promised herself she would not read the final response after five in the afternoon. Dr Archer read her draft and said, with a gravity she appreciated, “You need to remove the sentence where you say ‘no one died because we didn’t care.’ It’s true. It will get you into trouble,” and she nodded and cut it and then found herself, in the lift on the way down to the ward, whispering it anyway because there were truths you had to speak or they turned into mould.

One afternoon the fire alarm went off in that comic way that made everyone believe it was a drill and then be ashamed for not moving with urgency. Lottie herded people into the car park with the skills of a shepherd with a megaphone, and two patients used the chaos to make a bolt for the gate like boys at the back of class. Patsy gave chase in sandals she should not have worn, and caught up with the smaller of the two at the bus stop, where he was bent double, not by sprinting but by the discovery that running away still leaves you in your body. She put a hand on her own knee in sympathy and said, “We can pretend this was a test if you like,” and he said, without looking at her, “I hate the smell,” and she knew at once what he meant, the smell of polish and boiled vegetables and fear, and she said, “There’s a coffee place round the corner where it smells like burnt beans and ambition. Shall we,” and he straightened and said, “You’re not allowed,” and she said, “Probably not,” and they walked back. Later, Lottie lobbed a tea bag at her and called her an idiot and a saint, and Patsy caught the bag and put it in the mug and thought, as she watched the colour bleed out, about the way that very ordinary acts often feel like the world has conceded something.

She told Izzy the story and Izzy, who had turned a date with a woman who worked in publishing into a comedy about commas, brought round a bucket as threatened, a plastic thing the colour of a cartoon sky. “For your urges,” Izzy said, deadpan. “To put over them like a hen sitting on eggs. Or to throw over your head when you feel melodramatic. Also,” she added, handing over a packet of shortbread, “for crumbs.” They sat on Patsy’s sofa and ate the biscuits with the serious attention of athletes and talked about everything but the cupboard, because friendship sometimes involves acting as if the cupboard has already been dealt with.

On a humid evening when thunder made a promise it did not keep, a new referral arrived on her desk and tugged at her in a way that had nothing to do with the name or the diagnosis but with the address. It was a woman in her thirties who had given birth six weeks ago and whose husband had written in capital letters, “SHE IS NOT SLEEPING. SHE SAYS THE BABY IS A MIRROR.” The address lifted off the page and flew like a wasp: Chaplin Road. Patsy’s stomach did the ancient thing where it tried to leave by the quickest route. She picked up the duty phone and called the number and heard, at the other end, the exhausted breathing of a man who had been careful for too long. “I don’t know what to say,” he told her, voice breaking on the last word. “Say what you see,” she said, because it was better than say what you feel, and he told her about a woman holding a baby as if it were glass and about nights that were long like illnesses. She rang off and put her head on the desk and stared at the wood until it became a landscape she could walk across. She told Dr Archer where she was going and he nodded with a focus she liked, did not make a show of offering to come, and then scribbled his mobile on a Post-it and passed it to her without looking, which was, she realised, a gesture she trusted.

She had not been inside a house on Chaplin Road that was not her father’s for years. The street smelled like dust and tomato plants and a hint of detergent, and the door she knocked on was painted the colour Mira had once said was a lie about the sky. The man who opened it had a face that would have been handsome if it had not been arranged by sleeplessness, and behind him, in the narrow hall, a pair of trainers had been abandoned with the panic of people who do not have time for neatness anymore. The woman sat on the sofa with the baby on her lap and a look that made Patsy think of an animal who has been given a new cage and cannot work out how to forgive the old one. “He is a mirror,” she said matter-of-factly, before introductions could do their awkward dance. “When I look I see everything that is wrong. He holds it up.” Patsy sat on the edge of a chair and said, very quietly, “I wonder if he is a window,” and the woman’s eyes filled with tears in a way that made the room feel for a second as if the wall had fallen away. She said the words she had in her kit—postpartum psychosis, not your fault, a plan that involves not making you a hero in the wrong story—and she breathed with the woman in a way that, from the outside, would have looked like two people being boring. On the way out she saw, on the radiator, a tiny sock like a flag, and she had to put her hand on the banister to steady herself because the world had pulled off one of its small, stunning tricks—making the universal and the particular knock into each other hard enough to bruise.

The arch remained its unreasonable self. One night, lit blue for a cause she had not caught, it looked less like punctuation and more like a string pulled taut between opposite intentions. She texted Mira a photograph without comment and Mira wrote back, “He’s showing off,” and the relief of a joke shared about a thing that had once been a symbol and was now sometimes just a piece of nonsense architecture made Patsy lean her forehead against the cold glass of the window and smile until her cheeks ached. The cupboard remained, behind the sesame seeds and the anchovies. There were nights when she stood with the door open and argued with herself like a woman in an old play, and nights when she forgot it entirely until she woke at three with a thirst and found herself in the kitchen drinking water and realising, with a sensation that was not quite triumph, that she had gone a day without bargaining.

In late June, an email arrived asking for volunteers for an inquest, “representation required,” and she put her name down because if she did not, someone worse at words might be handed the job of speaking the unspeakable in front of a person in a black robe. Dr Archer, who strongly resembled a kind uncle when exasperated, told her he would come along and sit at the back like a charm against catastrophe, and she did not say thank you because some kindnesses shrivel when named. On the day, the courtroom smelled like carpet and misapplied perfume, and the coroner had a voice that had been trained to pass sentences without any of the old theatre. The family were there, wearing the careful faces of people who suspect they are about to be asked to audition for grief. Patsy spoke the phrases that belonged here—it was nobody’s fault and it was everybody’s fault; we did what we could and it was not enough; there are holes in nets and sometimes they are larger than our hands—and afterwards in the corridor the mother came up to her and said, “You looked at me when you talked,” and then began to cry in a way that made Patsy feel as if the floor had become a trampoline and someone else had chosen when to jump.

She went home that evening and watered the plant from the bottom because ritual, done with belief, has its own kind of spell. She cooked lentils because they were plain and nourishing and unshowy and she needed all three. She put the radio on low and let a man with a Midlands accent tell her about cricket with a detachment that felt like rescue. She took the bottle of codeine out of the cupboard in a move that felt both foolish and necessary, put it on the counter, read the label, said aloud, “Not for this,” and put it back. Then she stood and watched the arch for a full minute as if daring it to make a statement, and when it refused, was able to laugh.

The next morning her father called and said, with comic solemnity, “I have decided to become vegetarian for two weeks,” and Anjali shouted in the background, “He means the kind of vegetarian who eats bacon,” and Patsy leaned against the cupboard and laughed so hard she had to sit down. Later, in group, Yalda presented everyone with little bags of sweets for Eid and apologised for being extravagant and Ben put one in his pocket and said, “For my mum,” in a voice that made the room take a breath. Mr Ibrahim told a story about a dream where the arch had bent down and tapped him on the forehead and told him to stop being so literal, and the laughter that followed was full and old and kind. Patsy sat there with the packet of sweets in her lap and thought, with gratitude that did not embarrass her, that sometimes you survive by letting the small things accrue, sedimentary and honest, until they make a ground you can stand on without rehearsal.The heat arrived like a letter posted to the wrong address, and London, indignant, opened it anyway. By nine in the morning the pavements were performing their dirty shine and the air over the Ring Road shook as if the day were being held up to a gas flame. Patsy woke with her arm thrown over her face and the plant on the table looking theatrical, one leaf curved toward the window like a hand shielding its eyes. She stood at the sink with the toothbrush in her mouth and watched a woman over the road hang laundry with the careful speed of someone trying to outwit weather. The arch, under the loud blue, looked thinner, as if the sun had melted a centimetre off it and no one had called maintenance. She watered the plant from the bottom, as instructed, and felt instantly smug about her compliance with a rule that had never once complained.

At Park Royal the corridor smelt of warmed dust and lemon cleaner and that human note that could be translated as this is too much but we will do it anyway. Lottie had commandeered a desk fan and faced it directly at her own hair so that strands lifted and settled as if in applause. “I am a Renaissance painting of an angel who swears,” she announced, cracking ice into a plastic cup in a way that suggested she had learned to make cocktails in a previous life. “Also, the Summer Social email has matured like a cheese. It now promises ‘light entertainment’ and a ‘team-building surprise’ with the phrase ‘weather permitting’ added as if we are all agriculturalists.”

“I will come and entertain you by sweating,” Patsy said, dropping her bag under the desk in the place it had carved for itself by accumulation. “And I promise to build no team.”

“You will build a small team,” Lottie said with judicial certainty. “It will consist of me and a sausage on a stick.”

The Social turned out to be held on a strip of lawn at the back of a community centre that had once been a school if the height of the windows could be taken as evidence. A barbecue had been hired along with a man who took tongs seriously. Someone had thought to bring a paddling pool for children and then discovered the only children present were the kind made of office gossip and adult mischief. Dr Kwan, sending a photograph from his secondment captioned “Thinking of you,” looked tanned in a way that suggested an illicit relationship with the sun. Dr Archer stood near the paper plates with a can of lemonade and the air of a man who understood the mechanics of grief and was trying, politely, to understand the mechanics of small talk.

He was easier to be around than she had expected not because he didn’t ask questions but because he asked them cleanly, receiving answers without pressing at their edges. At some point, under the thin shade of a tree that had decided this year to be generous, he spoke of his wife in the plain, lived-in way of someone who had long ago discovered that gaudy adjectives attached themselves to the dead like burrs and had combed them out. “It was quick,” he said, and then later, “It was long,” and between the two sentences they both nodded because the truth had two faces and both were, unhelpfully, accurate. He asked about her father with the same carefulness he had used on his own subject, and she found herself describing the cardigan row and the rehab and how he wielded the phrase “from the bottom” now like a charm he could cast on any object that refused to be managed. “He will live forever out of sheer stubbornness,” she said, and Archer smiled as if she were quoting a study he’d read.

There were games, of course, enforced with a benevolence that had teeth. Lottie compelled them into a round of rounders and proved herself to be the sort of batter who believed in the power of shouting “Have that!” at an innocent ball. Patsy ran the bases with the conservative zeal of a person who did not trust her lungs, and laughed so loudly when she tripped over the edge of the paddling pool that three nurses turned around with expressions that asked, clinically, May we triage your joy. Someone, inevitably, fell in love with someone for the afternoon and then went home to explain their sunburn to a person who would not appreciate it. By the time they surrendered to the shade, she could feel a film of salt on her skin and her hair had collected the day as if rain had fallen in reverse.

That evening she let her flat be its cool self, blinds drawn, radio low. She lay on the floor because beds felt like promises and she wasn’t in the mood for vows, and held her phone above her face, watching the dots that signalled a person making sentences instead of decisions. Mira sent a photograph of a fan balanced on a windowsill like a threat and wrote, “Manchester is a hairdryer,” then followed with a picture of a queue forming politely outside a gelato place at ten p.m. with the caption, “We are choosing joy; prices are an insult.” Patsy sent back a picture of the plant with its leaves open as if in shock and wrote, “He is in his amazed period. I have promised to be supportive.” The return message came with a voice that had sweat on it. “Your plant was born for melodrama,” Mira said. “I hope you have spoken to him about managing expectations. Also I walked past a bee house at the allotments today and thought, unfairly, that your city probably pays people to deliver bees by courier.”

In therapy she was learning too slowly for any part of herself that enjoyed progress charts, which meant, according to the person she paid to nudge her away from the edge of herself, that she was doing fine. The room had one window and a view that was too honest to be picturesque, and a chair with arms she was very aware of controlling. She had caught herself, in the first session, adopting her work voice, the one that could have read aloud the minutes of a funeral and made them sound like a promise, and had forced herself to abandon it like a fib. “I would like us to avoid writing the clean version,” the therapist said early on, and she had laughed because her mind had already put paragraph breaks in her childhood and made a table of contents with tasteful headings. So she said messily that her mother had smelled of nail varnish and sugar and once, thrillingly, petrol; that the day she left, the letterbox made the same sound as any other post and that was unendurable; that she had hated the calendar cow not because it was a cow but because it had made the day look like any other; that she remembered sitting on the kitchen floor counting the tiles not because they were comforting but because they were, in their frost, utterly indifferent. The therapist mentioned a word she felt allergic to and then warmed toward—mourning—and Patsy retaliated with a joke about hand towels in guest bathrooms, which made them both laugh and then look down, embarrassed by the immediate intimacy laughter can force.

She stopped on Chaplin Road one evening and stared at the house that had once held her up like a cheap chair and thought how weird it was that we built our lives out of rooms that don’t know we exist. The young couple with the mirror-baby had been admitted for a spell of safety, the baby returned to an aunt for sleeping that allowed everyone else to breathe, and she had seen, in the woman’s face on the second morning, the way fear backs down when language arrives with a light and refuses to leave. It made her ridiculously loyal to words for the rest of the week. In the staff room she argued with a printer and apologised to it afterwards. In the corridor she told a man he was “enduring magnificently” and then felt guilty for handing him a medal he hadn’t asked for. At the bus stop she overheard a child say to her father, “We are the first people ever to be this hot,” and wanted to give her the Nobel for honesty.

Ben did something generous and very teenage: he turned up and pretended not to. He limped into clinic with a graze on his shin the size and shape of a county and told her, as soon as she opened her mouth, “Don’t start,” which was his version of I am scared. She asked if she might be allowed to begin and he rolled his eyes and then told her about a party that had got out of its own hands and how he had watched a boy he had, until that second, thought of as a minor god, take something and become a stranger and he had wanted, madly, to be a stranger too. She said the sentences that were boring and true and his foot kept time against the chair leg and she wondered, bizarrely and sincerely, if we should have a national service where everyone learns how to rock a chair in a way that calms instead of annoys. When he left he took the leaflet she had been sure he would refuse, because generosity is a muscle and sometimes lifting is possible.

In the middle of that hot, stretched week, her phone lit with a number she did not recognise and which somehow made the roof of her mouth go cold. She was in the hospital corridor, hand on the door to a room where a man had promised her he wouldn’t throw his tray again, and she stared at the screen until it had the decency to stop ringing and go to voicemail. She listened later in a quiet that had been overcharged by other people’s noise. The voice was unfamiliar and then, in the third word, completely known. “Trish,” it said, with the old music, “it’s your mother,” and then laughter, low, self-conscious, both apology and theatre. “I don’t know why I’m calling,” the voice continued briskly, and then she did know, of course, because calls from ghosts never arrive without a story on their heels. “I found a picture of you from Whitstable when you were six,” the voice said. “You were eating chips and scowling like a dockworker. Your father had his ridiculous hair and I had a jumper like a traffic cone. I thought I’d say hello. That’s all. Hello.” And then the polite click of a person who refuses to be caught leaving.

Patsy walked home with her head behaving badly. The city laid out its offerings—a man playing a saxophone under a bridge and making the bridge think well of itself, a van with a picture of a dog on it whose expression could only be described as philosophical, a couple arguing gently about whether basil was a real herb or something invented by restaurants—but she could not attach her gaze. She got home, put her bag down on the wrong chair, took it to the right one, put it down again as if the act of landing an object in its place could fix the mess in her head, and then stood in front of the cupboard as if it knew about postcards from the past. The bottle sat, of course, where it always sat, behind the sesame seeds and the anchovies, patient as a bad idea. She put her hand on the wood and said, quietly, “Not because of her,” and was half-sick with the melodrama of it and half-grateful for its protection. She took the bucket Izzy had left like a housewarming and put it on the floor next to her, and she laughed, aloud, alone, because the absurdity was the only possible god just then.

She did not call back that night. She called Izzy and told her and Izzy said, “Oh, well. Mothers,” with the same tone of voice she used for “rain,” and then stated categorically that the only way forward was to purchase very sharp cheddar and sit on the floor and eat it with a knife like pirates. They did not do that because no one in London actually behaves like a poem, but Patsy made toast at eleven and ate it standing up and thought, more kindly than she had since she was small, about a woman in a jumper the colour of the inside of a mouth. She sent a message to Mira that contained the word “hello” with a picture of a Whitstable gull that was trying to look dignified and failing, and Mira wrote back, “I am prepared to honour multiple meanings of hello. I am also prepared to find and burn that jumper,” and Patsy put the phone face down because it felt too much like a candle and the room was warm enough already.

In the morning, she bought a postcard that had a picture of a concrete whale in a children’s playground and wrote on it a sentence that, when she read it twice, made her cringe and then submit. “Hello back,” she wrote, then “We did have ridiculous hair,” and signed it with the truncated version of her name that belonged to no one and everyone. She posted it before work as if throwing a coin into a well she didn’t actually believe in, and then spent the day being very precise with other people because imprecision elsewhere had made her itchy. The girl with glitter came in and talked about the kindness of a pharmacist who had said, conspiratorially, “I prefer ginger nuts too,” and had thereby prevented her from crying in the aisle. Mr Ibrahim confessed to the infidelity of eating a burger on a fast day and they all staged a pantomime of shock that made him so happy he bought the biscuits the following week. Yalda told them a story about her youngest son addressing a pigeon as “Uncle,” and they fell about in the kind of laughter that rearranges grief into something briefly hospitable.

Her father received the news of the mother postcard like a man receiving a delivery he had ordered by accident. He shuffled in his chair, made a face as if the tea had betrayed him, then said, gruff and kind, “You will not be made to forgive anyone on a timetable,” and she believed him, which felt like the month’s most significant accomplishment. Anjali, who had never met the woman with the nail varnish and the sugar and the petrol, made a sound deep in her throat that was part battle cry, part lullaby, and put an extra piece of paratha on her plate which was her way of blessing and barracking at once. The television, loyally indifferent, showed a programme about people buying houses in countries they could not pronounce, and her father said, “We should go to the sea,” as if the sea were a prescription a GP might write in a reckless mood.

So they did. On a Sunday that held its breath and then exhaled in a breeze, they took the train to Brighton with pensioners and teenagers and women whose voices had known twenty different accents and now held five. The sea, when it arrived, presented itself in that grey-green slab that has always slightly disappointed the paintings. They walked along the promenade like clichés and Patsy ate chips and scowled like a dockworker and made a joke about prophecy. Her father put his hands in his pockets and tilted his chin and inhaled until his ribs protested. “Salt,” he said, solemnly, as if he had named an ancestor, and then laughed at himself because he had become a man who believed his own myths and in doing so had earned the right to keep them. They did the pier with the required bafflement at arcade games and the melancholy of music that has been on loop for decades. He let her drag him into a ridiculous photobooth and they sat on the wobbly bench and tried to smile at the exact wrong moment and emerged with four pictures in which they looked surprised by their own faces. “Evidence,” he said, holding them between two fingers as if he had won something for once, and she took one, and put it in her wallet behind a bus pass, and decided that the future could make of that what it liked.

Back in the office, the letter from the trust returned with its air of a door politely closing. They thanked her for her candour with a paragraph that had never been near anyone’s candour and informed her of actions that would be audited. She read it twice and then read the letter she had written to the mother privately, and for the first time since that day, did not feel like throwing something. Instead she put the private letter in the bottom drawer, under the spare lanyard and the good pen she used on new patients, and told Lottie, “We live in a world of drawers,” and Lottie said, “We live in a world of snacks,” and handed her a biscuit with currants that she hated and ate anyway because resistance sometimes needs the calories.

Dr Archer took to appearing at her door with a puzzle as if the hospital had turned into a village with doorsteps and TIME TO TALK written on the air. “Do you say antidepressant or SSRI on letters to GPs in 2025,” he asked once, not because he did not know but because he wanted to know what language she trusted. “Antidepressant,” she said, “and then the molecule when I want to sound like I could be invited to a meeting about molecules,” and he laughed softly and then told her a story about a man who had left his house one Tuesday with the intention of never returning and had been talked back into breakfast by a bus driver, and how sometimes the people who keep a city alive don’t even have a job description. He had opinions about fonts and shoes and the correct number of exclamation marks you were allowed in a month, and she found herself grateful beyond reason for this new friendship that did not require declarations.

On a Thursday when the sky made promises in the morning and broke them by lunch, Mira sent her a photograph of a field on the edge of the city where a path had been worn into the grass by faithful feet. “Desire lines,” the caption said. “We make them up and then everyone walks them.” Patsy stood at the window with the plant quite theatrically leaning and looked down at the pavement where she could see, even from this angle, the places where people cut the corner by the bus stop. She thought about desire lines in minds and cupboards and kitchens and texts and how, perhaps, her year had simply been an attempt to tread in the path that wore away the least skin. She typed, “I like the ones that avoid puddles,” and then, because she was, increasingly, unembarrassed by the small, wrote, “I am making pasta with too much garlic. This will be my legacy.” Mira sent back a picture of a garlic bulb with a face drawn on it and the words, “You have always been a dangerous woman,” and for one impossible minute Patsy believed that danger and kindness did not have to exclude each other.

The call from her mother came again, this time at an hour where people ask for a level of forgiveness the day is too honest to offer. Patsy let it ring once, twice, and then, because not every courage arrives with fanfare, she answered. The voice was less theatrical and more human. It talked about a kettle that had broken and a neighbour who sang opera badly and eyelashes that had finally gone grey. It did not apologise and it did not demand. It offered the sentence that had been needed and feared all at once. “I was bad at the life I had,” her mother said, with a plainness that took the taste out of Patsy’s mouth for a second. “I wasn’t bad at you. I was just—bad at the life. That’s not a defence. It’s just—what it was.” Patsy sat on the floor because sitting on the floor made her a person who did not have to be formal. She put the phone on speaker because she wanted her hands free for later when they would shake. She asked, in a voice she recognised from work and loathed and could not help, “Are you well,” and her mother laughed and said, “As well as a woman who eats toast for supper six nights out of seven can be,” and then, brave or foolish, “Do you like coriander now,” and they both laughed so hard they startled themselves. They did not arrange to meet and they did not plan to. They said hello and then they said goodnight, and it was both more and less than she had allowed in her rehearsals.

After, she opened the cupboard because it had become part of the ritual of being alive, a secular genuflection. She took the bottle out, weighed it like an apple, read the stingy label one more time. She put it in her bag and took it out and put it on the counter and then put it back again with a care that made her think of handling a baby with a head that doesn’t know how it belongs to a body yet. In the morning, she put it in her bag again and walked it to the pharmacy like a neighbour you have promised to deliver to a distant relative. “Disposal,” she said to the woman behind the counter, and the woman nodded as if she had been asked for directions and pointed neatly down. “In there,” she said, indicating a metal bin with a hole with the size of an admission. Patsy slid the bottle in and felt stupid tears touch her nose suddenly and violently. The woman, who had the face of a person who had watched several thousand acts of quiet bravery and had learned not to clap, said, conversationally, “My cat is called Malcolm,” and Patsy laughed so loudly she scared a child buying plasters. She walked out without looking back because sometimes the only way to honour a gesture is to refuse it an encore.

The next weeks had the specific light of days you don’t feel the need to name. She worked and she didn’t fix anything and she held a lot of mugs. She told Ben more lies about ducks and bread and he called her “weird” in a tone that had gentled. She held Yalda’s bag while Yalda cried at the smell of perfume in a shop because grief is an ambush and department stores are battlefield. She watched Mr Ibrahim write his wife’s name in his notebook over and over until he had filled a page and then, startled, turn it back over as if such love should not be caught. She went to see her father and he showed her a video on his phone of Denton’s cat being disgraceful in the parsley, and she sent it to Mira and wrote, “Evidence of vice,” and Mira sent back a clip of a Mancunian bee landing on a windowsill with the grandeur of arrival.

On a Thursday evening in July, when the sky decided it was exhausted and gave up, she walked out of the hospital with Dr Archer and found herself talking about the desire to narrate a life as if she were confessing in a language she had not sworn to in a church. “I keep making it make sense,” she said, aware of the irony and unable to stop. “I keep writing the version that will impress the coroner or the woman on the bus who overhears. I want the map. I want the key in the corner that says what the symbols mean, and then I want to throw the map away, smug and saved.” Archer listened, the way doctors who have been hurt are the best at listening, and then said, “I am a man who likes a key too,” with a grin that made his face look younger and kinder. “But sometimes,” he added, looking down at his shoes as if they might have an opinion on metaphors, “I thought I wanted a map and actually I wanted company. The map was a way of not admitting it.” She wanted to go home and write that down and pin it at eye level and salute it every morning. Instead she nodded, because carrying other people’s sentences on your face is a nicer trick than writing them down sometimes.

That night, in a flat that smelled faintly of hot dust and detergent, she stood by the open window and listened to the city perform its usual opera—foxes, bottles, a woman on the phone telling someone she loved them as if the words were brand-new—and she let herself have the dull, beautiful satisfaction of a person who had not ruined anything before bed. The postcard with the bee held its place. The photo booth strip from Brighton hid in her wallet like a spell. The plant pretended to be brave in the morning and was, more often than not, telling the truth. The arch lay along the horizon like the underline a child makes very firmly under a sentence they’re proud of. She closed her eyes and let the air touch her face and, with a moderation that would not impress a poet, promised to wake up and do the small kindnesses again. Then she slept, mouth open, unlovely and unconcerned, the way people do when they have learned, lately, not to hold their breath all night.The heat hung on like a guest who had misread the invitation and arrived two hours early. Buses grumbled as if offended by their own breath. The pavements threw back everything the sky gave them with interest. At work, the windows were open as far as they would go and did nothing but invite the hot air in to compare notes. Someone propped the fire doors with a stack of leaflets that had once been about sepsis and now were a collection of small sails. Lottie wore her hair in a plait that had aspirations to be practical and kept undoing itself with a theatrical sigh. “The summer has decided to be a personality,” she said, placing a bowl of supermarket ice on the table like it was a rare species. “I am not interested in character development. I would like predictable weather.”

The email about staffing arrived at eleven with the temperature already doing violence to manners. It had the kind of tone that made even compliments sound like warnings. Level of demand unprecedented; sickness rates; resilience; commitments to excellence; interim measures. It asked everyone to unpick their diaries as if calendars were knitted garments. Clinics would be combined where possible; evening cover extended; group work “rationalised,” which was bureaucracy-speak for something with an aftertaste. Dr Archer read it with a face that had learned, over years, not to spook anyone and then rested his finger lightly on the desk as if testing the wood for rot. “We will do what we can without doing the thing where we pretend we can do everything,” he said, quietly enough to make the sentence feel like a gift. “No one needs a hero who drops dead on a Tuesday.”

Patsy felt the scrape of the word hero and acknowledged its cheap thrill in her blood before it ebbed. She thought of benches and vending machines and all the people who held the city together by noticing small needs at inconvenient times. At lunch she took her salad to the stairwell because it was the only place that felt a degree cooler and sat on the steps like a student who had had the timetable changed on her. A porter carrying a fan up two flights nodded at her with the nobility of a man bearing a relic. She smiled at him with an affection that made her want to clap.

The home treatment team handed over a patient who had become a storm in a terraced house. A woman, mid-fifties, bereaved out of order, who had turned her kitchen into a museum of cups that did not want to be washed. “She has decided that sleep is a conspiracy,” the note said, and then, in handwriting that leaned rogue, “Her neighbours are saints. Someone has to win an award.” Patsy rang ahead and heard, in the man’s voice at the other end who said he was a nephew, the exhausted loyalty of a person who had not planned for this particular love. She took Lottie because Lottie had the kind of face that made people show you the good cups and Dr Archer because Archer had the kind of voice that made police stand on the doorstep and reconsider their own posture.

The house smelled of onions and old grief. The woman was barefoot, which felt like a detail her body had chosen in defence of her right to refuse the temperature. “Don’t touch the milk,” she announced, before hello, as if greeting strangers with the rules would make them less likely to rearrange her. Patsy took her place at the edge of a chair and let her eyes drift along the mantle where photographs lived, pausing on no one too long, the way you do when you are introducing yourself to a family. The woman spoke in sentences that held hands and then let go in the middle of the road. They followed her gently, gathered up clauses and nodded as if she had finished even when she had turned away. It was the work she trusted most: not fixing, not diagnosing in the air, just sitting inside someone’s weather without putting a roof on it. At one point the woman lifted a tea towel and stared at it as if it had offended her, and Lottie, without fanfare, took it and folded it into a smaller shape and returned it, and somehow that was the only intervention they needed for the next five minutes.

They left with a plan that contained words like tonight and tomorrow and no promises about next week. On the pavement, a boy rode past standing up on his bike with a face like triumph. Archer looked at the sky as if expecting it to answer a question he had refused to ask. “I like your tea towel skills,” he said to Lottie, and she flicked his sleeve with the corner of said towel. “It’s a transferable competence,” she replied, and greened all over with pride.

That evening, in her flat, the air had a stillness that made the curtains behave like liars. She watered the plant from the bottom, feeling inordinate satisfaction at the soundless soak, and propped all the doors. The postcard with the bee suffered the day cheerfully. She had half an hour before she was due to meet Izzy in a pub with a garden and an ice-machine with delusions of grandeur, and she used it to write three sentences in a message she wasn’t sure she would send. “I keep wanting to make a speech about restraint,” she typed, then backspaced because no one wanted to receive a lecture disguised as a note. “Hot,” she wrote instead to Mira. “Plant dramatic. I aspire to be equally obedient.” The three dots danced and then Mira sent a photograph of a fountain in a square snapped at an angle that made it look like a monument to spilt drinks. “I told the bees to get in,” she wrote. “They declined, citing university commitments.”

They sat under the pub’s weary jasmine and watched a boy at the next table propose to a girl with a ring that looked more like a token than a vow. Izzy, who had learned to keep opinions in a pocket until required, squeezed Patsy’s knee under the table in the ancient way that says I have thought forty thoughts and will only tell you the two that will not ruin anyone’s evening. “Tell me about your week without using the word resilience,” she said. Patsy did, galloping through the days like a horse allowed off the long rein for once, and only stumbled when she came to the part about the letter from the family and the reply she had sent them privately. Izzy nodded her, gently, into silence at the right time, and performed outrage at the bureaucratic version with a flourish that made the couple at the next table look over and grin. “Your face,” Izzy said later, when the lights went up in a way that suggested a curfew. “It’s the face you get when you are about to be brave in a minor way. You could warn people, you know. Put out cones.”

The power cut started with the sound of something far away making up its mind. At Park Royal the lights hiccuped and then took a second too long to steady. Monitors complained and then composed themselves like victims who had decided the drama was beneath them. Someone somewhere started a joke about horror films and was shushed by a nurse who had earned the right to veto genre. The generators did what they had promised to do and the corridors arranged themselves into a new kind of dim. The ward became more itself. Anxiety increased by small increments you could smell and not prove. People who had learned to be brave in the light wished, privately, for dawn.

Patsy and Archer did the walk that had already become muscle memory: doors, windows, sockets, faces. Lottie mother-henned the medicines trolley as if it were a toddler heading for stairs. In Room 3, Ben sat on the side of his bed with his hoodie over his head like a small weather system and said, without ceremony, “This is making me mental,” and she said, “It will come back,” because sometimes you lied with a full heart. He pointed at the blackened TV on the wall as if it had betrayed him personally and then, with a sigh that seemed to empty him out, said, “Tell me the duck thing again,” and she did, and he smiled like a child whose favourite book had been found under a chair.

Later, when the power returned like forgiveness, the ward loosened its shoulders by degrees. Archer stood at the window with his hands in his pockets as if renunciation was a hobby and said, almost to himself, “There used to be a summer in which this building felt bigger than it is. I remember bicycles everywhere and the sound of someone playing the same radio quietly on every floor.” Patsy wanted to ask why the sentence had made his eyes older. She did not because the corridor had filled with a tide of needs again and because in the list of questions you ask at work, some belong to rooms with sofas and an hour and a promise not to be interrupted.

Her father called on a Tuesday to ask for advice about ladders in a tone that made it clear the request arrived late. She could hear, in the background, the sound of Anjali’s exasperation not bothering to hide. “Hypothetically,” he said, as men always do when caught. “If a man wanted to change a bulb without becoming a news story.” She told him, with unreasonable firmness and a joke at the end she had stripped of laughter, to wait until she arrived and then caught the bus with a speed that made her feel adolescent. He met her at the door with the look of a boy who had been instructed to stand where he was, and she fell into a laughter she could not help and did not expect. They did the thing together, bulb in and old bulb wrapped in newspaper like a crime, and then sat for longer than necessary to recover from the accomplishment. He told a story about a neighbour who had installed solar panels and then stared at them for a week like they were a painting he had misunderstood, and she offered, with respect, the idea that some of us needed a long time to learn what we had done.

The second postcard from her mother had the picture of a donkey on it that seemed to be rolling its eyes. On the back, in a hand that knew when to loop and when to stop, were three lines: “I bought a kettle that lies about boiling. I saw a woman in a yellow dress reading a map as if it might surrender. I remember coriander being a fight we had once. I apologise to the coriander.” Patsy read it standing up at the sink and then sat down because sitting felt like a way of paying attention. She placed it on the fridge near the bee not because she wanted her kitchen to become a gallery of ambivalence but because it amused her to think of the two pieces of card getting into a small argument about what messages should be. She did not write back immediately. She waited for a day when she did not feel like using nouns as shields.

The day she returned the little bottle at the pharmacy, she saw a man in front of her pass across a bag of syringes and make no apology for needing to. It made her love the world irrationally. She went back to work with an emptiness in her bag that felt like the absence of a pocket you had used for too long. Lottie stood at her door with three forms and a doughnut and made a face like a cartoon being helpful. “Bureaucracy and sugar,” she announced. “The pillars of civilisation.” Patsy took the forms and the doughnut and felt an urge to write to someone about the woman’s cat called Malcolm that nearly knocked her sideways with affection.

On the Friday of the following week, Grace ended their session with a suggestion that sounded practical and therefore dangerous. “What would it be like to arrange to see her in a place where looking at something else would be permissible,” she asked, not coy, not insisting. “A museum. A garden. A cat show. Something with nouns that aren’t feelings.” Patsy thought of rooms with glass cases and labels written with a patient font, of benches that told you where to sit and light that had been arranged on purpose. She thought of the way, in those places, you can stand quietly next to someone and allow the object to be an excuse. “It would be both staged and merciful,” she said, which made Grace tilt her head in a way that suggested a laugh that had decided to stay in for now.

They chose, after a small argument with herself about symbolism, a museum that had more bones than paintings. It was not a cathedral to anything she or her mother had worshipped. It had a café that made hot drinks and the kind of cake that throws crumbs at you. The day arrived with too much sun. She wore a dress that made no claims to be other than cool. She got there early and sat on a bench near a case of birds arranged in poses that felt like lies. People moved past her repeating the facts on the labels as if learning a new language out loud. Her mother arrived late in a way that felt on time for who she had been, and when she did, she looked exactly like a person who had lived a life and refused to let old adjectives have the run of her face. There was something witchy and beautiful about her hair choosing its own direction. Her earrings were the only glamorous thing about her and they swung with a decision her voice did not yet trust.

They began not far from a prehistoric skeleton because it was easier to point at old bones than at themselves. “I never liked these when I was a girl,” her mother said, carefully. “The bones made me think of furniture.” Patsy made a noise that was almost a laugh and their eyes found each other and held without flinching. “I liked the labels,” Patsy said. “They made the world sound like a thing you could own if you pronounced it right.” They drifted side by side like boats. They read a sentence about a creature whose name had six vowels in it and repeated it in the slow way that meant you were committing to saying it later in a shop. They stood near a glass case of moths and it was the moths her mother chose to lean toward, as if she could not resist the metaphor even when she was trying. “I was bad at the life I had,” her mother said again, but this time it came out like weather rather than confession. “I thought everything was a fire. Everything. Even the good stuff. Who told me that. I cannot remember. I kept thinking if I ran I would find the door that was the right door. It turned out I was the door. It is not a flattering story.” Patsy listened in the way she had taught her whole self to listen and felt, at the base of her throat, the beginnings of something that might be forgiveness but did not require a ceremony. They ate cake and the crumbs misbehaved and the woman behind the counter wore glitter on her eyelids like a dare to day. They left promises at the door in the form of a date that did not sound like a test.

Back at Park Royal, Ben arrived in a state that would have been comic if it had not been his body doing it. He had a graze on his cheek that had dried into a shape like a country no one visited on purpose. He stood in the doorway with one hand in his pocket and the other hand miming the act of pressing a doorbell. “I did the stupid second, not the stupidest,” he said, which was both confession and boast, and she called Izzy in her head to tell her that her sentence had made it into another person’s life. She did not lecture him. He was already carrying a lecture in his hip bones. She put a glass of water in front of him the way you put a candle in a window and he rolled his eyes and drank it and then told her, in four sentences, the story of a night that had been a cliff and the particular toe-hold he had found. She wrote down in the notes afterward: named the first thought; did not pursue the second; allowed the third to be ridiculous; agreed to meet Friday. It was both banal and the kind of faith she understood.

Mr Ibrahim brought in a box of dates that had been wrapped with a ribbon as if by a child and handed them out with a ceremony that made the whole group feel like a festival no one had seen coming. Yalda announced that she had eaten a pomegranate and it had not made her sad and they all cheered like idiots and it was exactly right. Lottie stood in the doorway and watched her people with the sort of private smile that belongs to good teachers and bartenders and nurses, and then announced, loudly, that anyone who left crumbs would be dealt with according to the law. Afterward, in the corridor, she stood with Patsy and they both looked at the floor as if it had become news. “I like your face,” Lottie said, suddenly, a child with a truth. “It used to be a bit like a cupboard. Now it’s a bit like a window.” Patsy had to stand very still not to ruin the compliment by narrating it to death.

Archer took her to a meeting she had always avoided and it was not awful. Commissioners sat in a row with expressions they probably practised in mirrors and clinicians trooped through their sliding doors of PowerPoints, making their case with graphs that had been coerced. Archer spoke plainly about holes in nets and the cost of stopping people falling through them, and she watched as one of the commissioners, a woman with an immaculate parting and a pen she did not write with, lowered her shoulders a fraction as if relieved not to be being sold a miracle. Later in the corridor, Archer said, “I always worry I’ll turn into a type of man I dislike in those rooms,” and she said, “What type,” and he said, “The man who speaks for too long because he is trying to make the room like him,” and she laughed because she recognised herself in the category, and he smiled as if granting her entry into a club where everyone coughed and passed around humility like a cigarette.

On a Tuesday that pretended to be autumn for six hours before remembering itself, she collected a pile of belongings from the charity shop near the Tube where everything smelled faintly of a grandmother who might not actually exist. A wooden frame that had once held a photograph of a baby she would never know; a vase with a crack that made honesty of it; a coat she would wear for three weeks and then donate back because it had decided it looked better on someone who could whistle. At the till, the woman wrote down the price on a pad with a carbon copy and it felt so friendly that Patsy almost bought a leather belt out of respect. She took the frame home and slid into it, behind the glass, a picture of the plant like a joke. It made her laugh every morning, which was the only return on investment she demanded anymore.

She met her mother again, this time in a park where dogs had the right of way, and the conversation was not a ladder but a set of low steps. They talked about ice creams and shoes and how pigeons had discovered sincerity. She let her mother tell the story of when she had been young and walked into the sea fully dressed because she had wanted to see if salt could get through corduroy. In return she offered, carefully, the story of how she had counted tiles at eight and how she still sometimes stood on the kitchen floor and felt the frost under her feet like an old religion. They did not touch because now was not the time to give their hands meaning, and when they left, they both looked, without intending to, for the other’s shadow on the grass.

On a weekend when Manchester was a rumour and the arch drew itself in white economy across the sky, Mira came down with a bag that was half work and half apology. They walked to a market that had once been a place for actual vegetables and was now a place where vegetables were interviewed. They bought peaches that had to be eaten leaning forward. They argued lovingly about the correct ratio of salt to lemon on chips. They did not make a drama. They sat on a wall and watched children fight a kite into compliance, and the kite did the thing kites always do and pretended to be a fish until it remembered it was a paper idea of a bird. “We’re all right,” Mira said, as if reporting back from a committee meeting that had been held in a hurry and achieved a surprising amount. “We’re all right,” Patsy said, and meant, today you have not broken any of the crockery in my head.

Monday returned, as it does, with a tone. The group was silent for longer than usual and she let the silence hold its shape. People fidgeted without shame. The biscuits were there like a translation of generosity. When someone finally spoke it was Yalda, who said, with the drama of a woman who has earned it, “I told my son that when he grows up he must not choose a person who smells like sadness, and he looked at me like I had invented a new science,” and the room laughed and then breathed and then quietly began to talk about inheritance and the small items of behaviour we take from our parents like salt shakers and carry from kitchen to kitchen without realising we have packed them. Mr Ibrahim confessed to a new sin—he had bought a shirt with a floral pattern—and the confession made him so happy that Patsy wondered why people didn’t confess to joy more often in the world.

That afternoon, after a clinic where a woman had spoken about hating her feet with a sincerity that had made everyone in the room want to kneel and apologise on behalf of toes, Patsy sat at her desk and wrote, without fuss, two postcards. One to her mother, with a photograph of a fox in daylight looking both disreputable and holy, on which she wrote, “I prefer coriander now. This is not a metaphor. I am considering growing some. Advice welcome.” The other to Mira, with a picture of a pedestrian crossing painted with a local artist's interruptions, on which she wrote, “We ate peaches and survived the juice. I call that progress.” She posted them and walked back to the hospital slowly, as if the act of moving her body through the hot afternoon might count as a decision.

When she let herself in that night, the flat had that impression domestic spaces sometimes give, of having conducted a small play in one’s absence and now tolerating your presence as if you were an understudy. She put her keys in the bowl and the sound they made was the sound that convinces you home is an object rather than an effort. The plant had turned a leaf toward the window like a small flag of loyalty. She checked the soil with a finger, as if it were a pulse. She put the kettle on. The radio made a point of being moderate. She took the strip of photobooth pictures out of her wallet and stuck them to the side of the fridge with a magnet so weak they endangered the whole enterprise and stood back to see if anything had exploded in the heart. She felt only that ordinary hum she had begun to count among the virtues.

Later, she went to bed and discovered that sleep resisted and then arrived in a small wave. She woke in the night, not from fear but from thirst, and in the kitchen she let the cold water bite. The arch lay where it always lay, an underline with a too-confident hand. She resisted the urge to make it a person, a symbol, a judge. She let it be an object. She put her palm flat on the cupboard door with no drama attached, a hand on a wall to steady herself before moving on. She said, because it worked, because repetition is not always an insult to intelligence, “Not tonight,” and smiled at herself for the small theatre of it. In the morning, the light arrived indecent and she greeted it as if she were meeting a neighbour in the hall with both of them still in their sandals. The day waited. She made coffee and put too much milk in it. She left early and stood on the footbridge watching the canal pretend to be a road to somewhere other than Park Royal. She walked into the building with the posture of a woman who had decided to participate. It was, she had learned, the highest form of bravery she could afford daily without overdrawing her account.
