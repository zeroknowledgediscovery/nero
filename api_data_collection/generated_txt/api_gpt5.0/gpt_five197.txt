The morning the photo hit all the feeds, Lark woke with the sound of a duck in her ear.

Not an actual duck, but that wetly polite quack that sounds like a throat clearing. The kind that slides in under a door no matter how many pillows stack against it. She’d been dreaming of them for weeks: heads down, green sheen on top, slow paddling little machines that carried more mystery than their waddle deserved. A beak turning. A bead of a black eye finding her from the reeds.

“Stop,” she told the empty room, and then found her phone by sweeping the charger cord along the floor like a fisherman. The screen lit with the same picture over and over, re-shared, meme-ified, captioned a dozen ways, none of them generous. A paparazzi caught her at Swan Grove, the park in Studio City with the pond and the willow trees, except that day the swans had been outnumbered. Mallards had arrived in a green-headed gang. Lark’s posture in the photo said everything: her shoulders up like rabbit ears, hand up to block, eyes wide, mouth in a small, round O, the way people make a small O before they scream in a movie. The nearest duck looked profoundly unconcerned. The headline said DUCK, LARK! Fear is a four-letter word if you write it as DUCK.

Her agent texted four times before the coffee pot wheezed. Denise wrote the kind of everything-okay message that means nothing is okay without press management. The PR team suggested posting a video hugging a duck. The director of the film she was due to promote sent a shrug emoji that Lark read as: this again.

She didn’t reply. She sat in the slick rental kitchen in the hills and drank coffee that tasted expensive and metallic. Her phone trembled alive on the counter, buzz buzz, like a fly against a screen. She turned it over. She covered it with a napkin. The quack came back anyway, like a thought you can’t disinvite. She closed her eyes and felt a wild rush under her ribs, a flutter. People always said butterflies for nerves. Those felt too pretty. What lived inside Lark were frantic sparrows throwing themselves against glass.

The thing with the ducks wasn’t new. It wasn’t even unusual. If you were Lark Corwin and you had been nine in Westfield when your father married a woman with a stepdaughter and a backyard that touched the little municipal pond—if you had been that person you too might remember the way the ducks would climb the slope in a polite row like they were walking into your kitchen to ask for tea. You’d remember their tiny wet footprints. You’d remember one of them turning its head toward you, the slow, low-feeling look that felt like a calculation. You’d remember not trusting their quiet, and your new stepmother laughing and saying, Come on now, they’re hungry, Lark, they’re not assassins.

She became a movie star for a messy stew of reasons (she had the kind of face cameras like to drink, she had patience for long days, she was better than you would think at making chaos look intentional, and also luck, luck with a capital L that felt like someone else’s game). The world was wide with lenses. So some things could hide. You could be terrified of the sight of a webbed foot and no one would know for eight years.

Denise called. Lark picked up because it felt like not picking up was choosing a new kind of hell, the one where someone in a suit starts using the phrase "noncompliance" in a sentence.

“You’re a headline,” Denise said, without hello, voice already running on the heel of a high shoe. “Is it real? Tell me it’s a bit. Tell me we can turn this. Tell me we can get a children’s book out of it in eighteen months.”

“It’s real,” Lark said. She tried to laugh then, as if by laughing she could frame it as a brand. You know me! Quirky fear of ducks! Movie star—afraid of a backyard animal! Did you know? “I don’t think I can work with them anymore. Or near them. Or like, within the radius of a duck's thought.”

“Within the radius of a duck’s thought,” Denise repeated, and sighed. “You’re on Fallon Thursday. They’re going to try to bring one out. You need to be able to handle plastic. If it’s rubber we can talk. We can lean into rubber.”

“Rubber is worse. The eyes on those… they’re fixed and they know it.”

“Okay this is spiraling. Listen. Post that shot of you feeding ducks when you were what, ten? People need continuity. Vintage content. Nostalgia gives them context. Then we do a few light interviews, you tell a funny story, we do a donation to some bird sanctuary, we make you an animal lover again who’s just having a human moment, okay?”

“I never fed ducks. That picture is of June,” Lark said, and swallowed the name because it felt like something unwrapped in a room full of strangers. June with her knees dirty, tossing crumbles from her palm, laughing in that way she always laughed when something lived in two states at once—beautiful and ridiculous.

The call ended on a plan that sounded like a plan: a social post, a retort, a dress chosen that couldn’t possibly read duck. Lark put the phone down. She wanted something that did not exist. She wanted, in a sudden old way, her hometown kitchen and the radio low, the tiled table, the sunlight off the pond, even the smell from the pond, which was part fish, part damp, part algae, part laundry dryer vent that wafted in from the house next door.

Her driver was waiting in an app. Had been for twenty minutes. The little car on the map made jittery hesitant movements, like perhaps the driver had a duck of his own.

“Where to?” he said when she finally slid into the cool back seat, her baseball cap down and her sunglasses up. He clocked her in the way people do when they think they might know you later.

“Westfield,” she said.

He glanced back. “You mean Westwood?”

“No,” she said. “Westfield. The one with the mall and the pond and the ice cream place that sells the weird lavender flavor.”

“That’s not around here,” he said, carefully.

“No. I know.” She shrugged. “LAX. Then... I’ll get the rest.”

On the plane, she read the same page of a magazine four times because the article on sustainable engineering kept breaking itself into the face of a mallard. She wrote a text to June, then deleted it. She wrote a text to her father that said “Coming home,” and didn’t send that either. The drink cart clanged past. The woman next to her tried to start a smiling war. Lark closed her eyes and made a movie in her head. In the movie she went to Westfield and nothing mattered as much as everyone said it did. In the movie, the world would forgive a person their biological brambles. In the movie, the pond would be frozen again, and she and June would skate on dull blades that cut soft white lines the shape of words you didn’t want to say out loud yet.

The airport smelled like cinnamon and floor wax and nobody recognized her when she pulled up her hoodie. Westfield did not have a paparazzi economy. The taxi driver did not ask for a selfie. He asked if she had cash because the card reader did not like rain. It was not raining. Everyone in town talked like it might, though—they looked up and mentioned the possibility as you handed them a five, as they bagged your bananas, as they told you it had been a wild week for the Hawks.

Her father’s house had a new paint color no one had prepped her for. It had been a quiet yellow in her mind; it was now some stoic gray that made the house look like it had been reading books about boundaries. The front garden had knows what it was doing. Ranks of lavender. A lemon tree. A small wind sculpture made of copper hands.

When she walked in, she heard the kitchen radio sweetly tin and June explaining how to solder to someone over speaker.

“You’re late because you don’t respect my time,” June said. “No,” she added, “that’s me being dramatic. You’re late because time is a circle and you live in a line. Left hand steady, okay? If you’re going to blow up, don’t do it in my face.”

June didn’t look surprised to see Lark in the doorway because June never looked surprised the way regular people did. She breathed in slowly, like painters step back to catch the whole of what they’ve been working on. She was a little taller than Lark remembered, or maybe she just stood more decided. Her hair was cut blunt and practical, her hands were steady and shop-stained, and her shirt read ALL MY HEROES DIED AT MACH 26.

“Call me back,” June said to her phone, and hung up. “Hey.”

“Hey,” Lark said. And because homes have scripts, she added, “You cut your hair.”

“You ran away from ducks,” June said. Not unkind.

“I didn’t run.” Lark put her bag down. “I… okay, I ran. You saw.”

“Everyone saw,” June said. “Westfield might not have paparazzi, but we have the internet.”

They hugged. The hug was familiar, even if everything else had gotten new edges. When they were younger, their hugs had been a message: we will do our best to invoke sisterhood even if our families were reorganized at the council of adults and then told to buzz like bees. Now it was its own thing. A small port city where weather didn’t matter.

“Your room is as you left it,” June said. “With the addition of an oscillating fan that sounds like an old man concerned about politics.”

“My old room.” Lark smiled at the phrase, worn smooth from use. No one’s room is as they left it. They had child selves that had moved out. Two steps into the hallway she understood that rule—on the wall there was a framed magazine cover of Lark from two years ago, and opposite it there were three pencil sketches of cylinders with fins, and on the floor at the far end a basket of lemons, each with a little face drawn on in sharpie.

“You drawing on fruit?”

“They were asking for it,” June said.

Their father came home with soil on his hands, the good kind. He made a Lark noise, which was a sound that had her name in it without needing the letters, a small delighted exhale, and then he stood there in his boots and waited like he had learned not to rush a person who had just crossed a distance. His second wife, Tamara, was in Santa Fe for a pottery intensive and sent a photo of a vase that looked like it had been built to be angry.

They ate something simple that did not have duck in it. People kept trying to be funny about that, Lark found, as if cruelty becomes less when you drape it in roasted orange slices. Her father asked her about the work, careful and kind. June asked nothing. June talked about materials. The kitchen filled with parts: the word for a curved section of a nose cone, the way to hold a file, the bland perfection of stainless steel when you want heat to have a place to go that is not critical.

“Just say it,” Lark said finally, hand flat to the table. “I’m ridiculous. Say it. Everyone else is. The director said ‘we can always CGI them out, sweetheart’ to my face.”

“I think you’re not ridiculous,” June said. “But tell me what you think is my opinion.”

“That I should control it. That I should get over it. Exposure therapy. Like a video montage—me feeding a duck, me hugging a duck, me acting with a duck named Winston.”

“I am not putting animals in a montage,” June said. “But if we’re doing honesty, it is inconvenient if your job wants ponds and your nervous system wants deserts.”

Their father stirred his tea and said, “Deserts have birds too. Sandpipers. Tall cranes. Buzzards. Very cinematic.”

“Stop,” Lark said, and laughed despite herself, which hurt her ribs for some reason. “It is inconvenient. But calling it ridiculous doesn’t make it less. It makes me feel like I’m failing an exam that I didn’t choose to take. Did you know ducks can sleep with one eye open? That they actually do that? How am I supposed to be out there doing soft smile eyes into a lens when some bird is half asleep and half seeing me?”

“You know other animals do stranger things,” June said. “Sharks sleep while moving.”

“That’s not comforting, June.”

“It should be,” June said. “They keep going. That’s the whole point of life. You keep going and if you have a fear you give it a seatbelt.”

She said it like she believed it. Lark wanted to believe it too. Her father reached for the honey and missed, and nobody corrected him because he found it the second time anyway.

That night, in her old room that was now a guest room with her face on the wall, Lark lay under a quilt and let the sound of the pond come through the window screen. No matter how long she had been gone, Westfield sounded like itself. Freight trains that took forever. A teenager practicing drums across the street. The occasional car that made too much of a noise because some boy’s father had left the world and the boy needed the engine to be a person for a while. She turned her phone face down. It did not know how to lie there quietly. It had to twitch, to remind. Then, because her brain was a grinning jerk, she started to count ducks instead of sheep.

She stood at the pond at dawn because the body remembers paths even when the mind doesn’t approve of the destination. She’d slipped out while everyone slept—June on the couch covered in a schematic, her father still on the left side of the bed because even remarriages keep the map of the old house. The fog was like a careful old woman smoothing a scarf. A man with a dog nodded. The dog was small and named Pancake. Lark knew because the man said it to the dog twice, partly to tell her what the dog was called. It felt like the kind of morning when everything tries to be good.

Then a duck saw her.

Or she saw it. It had the spherical, indifferent head that a duck wore to breakfast. It turned. The low cold in her went on. She backed up. Her hands were up as if in a robbery. The duck was not interested. The ducks never were, that was the stupid part. The fear had nothing to do with their intention. The fear was a current under glass you only saw when it rippled the cup.

“Are you okay?” asked a voice, which turned out to be attached to a boy who looked fourteen and had a skateboard and the world’s most merciful eyebrows. Kids, she thought. The exact mercies.

“I’m fine,” she lied. Then she tried again. “No. I’m a little… weird about these birds.”

“Ducks?” He said the word without malice. He set one wheel of the skateboard down, then took it back up. “My aunt’s afraid of bananas,” he offered. “It’s like the curve. Makes her feel judged.”

Lark laughed again and this time it didn’t hurt. “I might be afraid of their curve too.”

She sipped air until the ducks gave her a gift and drifted away. She walked home past a flyer for a missing cat named Mouse. She tried to feel the ground. She tried to feel her feet.

June was in the garage when she got back, which wasn’t a garage anymore but a laboratory made of porch fans, lists in chalk, and the far sweet smell of burnt metal. The door groaned. June didn’t look up right away. Lark just watched. The two silver sections of something stood in the corner, upright, like a pair of bored Romans waiting to be sent to a war. Not two. One in halves.

“This is the part where you tell me I’m insane,” June said, finally raising her head. “Before you do, remember you used to put on your mother’s wedding dress and go to Dairy Queen for a dipped cone on the day summer began. We all have our calendars.”

“What are you building,” Lark said, like she didn’t know, because saying it out loud changes the gravity of a room.

“A rocket,” June said. “Or some language of a rocket, for now.”

Lark laughed then and moved closer so she could take in the welds, the inset rings, the stiffeners, the way June’s hands had learned softness around hardness. There were notes on the wall. Names like Hargrave. Words like bipropellant and delta-v and orbit, all spelled correctly in June’s neat hand, as if that were what would change the fate of a body. Spelling.

“It’s not what you think,” June said. “I mean, it is exactly what you think, but also even more ridiculous. I am not starting a billion-dollar company. I am building a rocket that could go up with a person like you could ride a stubborn horse—only once, only maybe to the edge of what we call the place where we are. It’s an idea. It’s my idea. I won a municipal innovation grant. The town thinks it’s a sculpture. The town is half-right.”

“You won a what?” Lark said, feeling the small grin that made people think she had a joke even when she didn’t.

“Westfield Municipal Arts and Innovation Fund. Sponsored by the mall and a person who made a lot of money selling water in cans. They think they’re paying for a pretty thing to put outside the library with the plaque that says 'we dreamed,' and they are. But also, if you engineer a sculpture correctly, you can use it to leave.”

She said all this casual, like a grocery list. Lark touched the cool skin of the cylinder with her fingertips and felt a ripple of fear because if the thing meant what June meant it to mean, the object in front of her was the exact opposite of a duck. A duck said: come close, because I’m in the world and so are you. A rocket said: you can go. To the other side of night. To the black that is not empty.

“This is illegal,” she said, eventually.

“Not at this scale,” June said. “And what’s illegal where changes because we push against our own rules long enough that they accommodate us. And I’m not going to the moon. Not yet. I’m going to the sky in a way that matters to me. I need test pilots who are not afraid to breathe hard.”

“Don’t look at me,” Lark said. “I nearly fainted at the mall fountain.”

“I am not looking at you like a pilot,” June said. “I am looking at you like a person who knows what it means to be looked at. There will be cameras. There will be the world. There will be men who want to collect failures the way other men collect foreign coins. They will count. They will say names wrong on purpose. I need someone who knows how to tilt their head and make it not matter.”

“You’re going to build a rocket and what you need from me is… posture?”

“Among other things,” June said. “You have a platform that is a half-built stage. I have a thing that everyone will want to stand on and shout. We could trade the parts we have.”

“You want my mouth to be a ladder,” Lark said, and June grinned, guilty.

“And also,” June added, softer. “I want something else. I want to give you a piece of sky that is never going to have a duck in it.”

Lark looked at her sister then and felt time fold weirdly. When they were teenagers, they had lay on the trampoline in Tamara’s yard and watched planes cross, tiny white lines drawn by cold. June would say their flight numbers like a magic trick—she’d look them up and whisper secret numbers like spells. She wanted to be a pilot then, then an engineer, then a person who found a way to be both because why stop. Lark wanted to be in front of a camera because inside the lens things behaved. Now they stood here again, older and more ourselves.

“You get it,” June said. “You get it the way the pond gets the moon. Takes it like a fact and still makes it beautiful.”

The rest of that week was small and big at once. Denise called daily with instructions that felt like they were written in a font designed to erase you. Post the thing. Laugh at yourself. Say “I just have a tiny quirk” in the baby voice people use to sell cute. Lark posted nothing. She went to the grocery store and a woman from the bank put her hand on Lark’s wrist and said, “I feel exactly how you feel but about escalators, and I still go on them because there’s no staircase at Target,” which warmed Lark in a place that fame had not reached. A high school friend texted “Are you in town or am I seeing your ghost at Beans & Books,” which was the name of the cafe that had survived the war against big coffee somehow, weak but undefeated. Her father planted beans like the world would continue. June built.

“Not everyone is going to like this,” June warned, when she finally had a prototype that made noises not unlike a large cat in yoga. They stood in the cul-de-sac. The neighbors had collected themselves in chairs like an audience at a small town parade. Mr. Roscoe, who ran the radio repair store, wore a hat that said 20 METERS MAKES LIFE. Children wore headphones and skepticism. The newspaper sent a kid with a notebook who described himself as a student of journalism and then asked if he could film it vertical for Instagram because that’s where the paper’s engagement lives, ma’am.

“I never asked everyone to like me,” June said. “I asked them to brace.”

The first test did what first tests do. It shivered and stuttered. It huffed. It lifted an inch and then politely sat back down like someone changed their mind. Mr. Roscoe clapped anyway. A man named Ron (there’s always a Ron) rolled his eyes and said, “It’ll never work with an off-the-shelf compressor. You need injection. That, or a miracle.” Someone else snorted. A child said, “Can it go to Mars,” as if Mars were a mall.

“People think miracles are a kind of lightning bolt,” June said later, when they sat on the garage step with two sweating bottles of soda that tasted like lemon and other lemon. “Really a miracle is just a lot of tiny mechanical parts saying yes at the same time.”

“You’re going to make it say yes,” Lark said.

“I’m going to listen for where to say I’m sorry,” June said. “Don’t say that to the paper. They like you confident or nothing.”

Lark walked to the pond again even though it was a bad idea. She liked bad ideas that involved footwear and short distances and no press. Beside the bench there was a man feeding ducks even though the posted sign said do not feed them, bread is bad for birds. He made a show of ignoring the sign, which is a familiar performance. He had that kind of shirt older men wear like a story, with a small embroidered ship that suggested he’d been a captain of something maybe or just in the navy or just liked a sale. He glanced at her twice. He had seen her in a movie once and not remembered her name. He had seen her in a picture yesterday and learned it for the pleasure of saying it wrong.

“Lark,” he said, which was the first time anyone said it like a scold. “You know they’re just ducks. The world is burning and you’re afraid of ducks.”

She stood there with her hands in her pockets and felt like someone had opened a window before the house was warm enough to want it.

He continued, because men like to complete the sound of their own lessons. “People got real problems. Real things to be afraid of. I got a brother who can’t sleep unless he sees his meds on the dresser. That’s fear. Yours is… c’mon. It’s like saying you’re allergic to Tuesdays.”

“Okay,” she said, and because she had learned some things from actors who are also fighters, she separated her body into two layers: the place where the words would go and the place where her shame would live. “Maybe I’m not being heroic enough for your enjoyment. I’m not being brave in the way that photographs well. I didn’t ask to be. Why do we all keep asking everyone to impress us. Maybe some of us are just people with bones and batteries and a weird kind of brain.”

He muttered something that might have been a dismissal or a swear. A duck came closer and she took a step back. Someone took a photo. The world made a click. She held her ground anyway. The town would read about it and be split down the middle because towns love to be split and then slowly healed by an event involving pie.

“Come by the garage,” June said, when Lark told her about it later, small and brittle. “I need your arm strength to hold this steady while I recalibrate the thrusters. No—you have tiny wrists. I need your attention instead. Attention is the stronger muscle. Hold this thing in your head and don’t look away.”

It was good work, the kind that made your brain quiet enough inside. June explained each thing out loud to herself and the room like she was both teacher and student. The rings aligned. The tubes hissed. The valves listened. They were making a thing that wanted to leave. That was the part that kept sticking inside Lark’s chest: the audacity of not just wanting to leave, but building the door. She had left Westfield earlier than people thought she would. That was nothing. She’d used airplanes and cars and trains and a talent people liked to believe came from nowhere. This was not that. This was making movement from a held breath.

That night, Lark posted something. Not a duck video. Not a joke. A picture of June’s hands, greased and deliberate, holding the edges of the cylinder like you hold a person at the threshold of something, and under it she wrote: The future isn’t over us. We’re still voting on it.

Denise called so quickly it felt like she had been lying in wait.

“What the hell is that,” she said.

“My sister,” Lark said. “In case you forgot. And me, choosing a different room to stand in.”

“Fine,” Denise said. “That’s actually kind of gorgeous. Not the hands, the copy. You could sell wellness with that. If you must soft-launch your departure from brand duck-chatter, at least let me be the one to monetize it.”

“I thought I was the brand.” Lark was tired past her bones.

“You are the brand if the brand can be rescued from birds by a blonde with a toolbox. Just—be careful. The world loves to cheer a woman for leaving and then trip her at the door.”

“She’s not blonde,” Lark said. “And she carries a welding mask like it’s a crown.”

“Even better,” Denise said, her voice shifting. “Send me three more images. I’ll build a carousel. People love carousels.”

Not everyone did. There were comments that said, Shut up and kiss a duck for charity. There were ones that said, Women have been building rockets since you were in pigtails and now you want clout off it, boo. The ones that hurt more were smaller and close. A woman from her high school wrote, Remember when you laughed at my fear of Ferris wheels, karma is a wheel, babe.

“I did not laugh,” Lark said to the air. “I smiled because your mother had just bought you cotton candy and your face was blue.”

She stepped back out into the dusk because in Westfield dusk had a texture you could use to heal yourself. June was bent over the rocket again. Her hair stuck to her neck. A small fly considered the back of her hand and then amended its plan when she flicked it away without looking. Lark had a sensation then, a tiny, ambitious one, of a kind she would probably have to fight. It felt like wanting to be a part of whatever June's life was turning into in a way that would matter historically. It felt like the beginning of an answer to a question she had not dared put into her mouth. It felt like movement toward something that wouldn’t fit neatly into a segment on late night television.

“You test again tomorrow,” Lark said.

“If the goose-neck fittings arrive,” June said. “If Ron doesn’t try to sabotage me with his opinions. If the town allows it. Pax Roscoe is sending the mayor’s office a tray of donuts. He swears donuts do more than petitions.”

“You asked for support,” Lark said, remembering the way towns attach themselves to something like ivy climbing a wall and then tear it down later when it gets too tall.

“I asked for a clean launch window,” June said. “Support is… noise.”

The next morning the mayor came by with a camera crew from the station that only ran news when there was an incident at the high school or when the cherry blossoms hit all at once and everyone lost their minds. She wore a blue jacket like a sky promise and said words over a microphone about innovation and community and liftoff. A man from the fire department evaluated the extinguishers and issued a mild frown. Mr. Roscoe wore his hat again like a permission slip. Children sang a song no one had written for this occasion, a song about up and away they’d learned from a cartoon. Lark stood beside June and put her body’s quiet to the service of the moment. If she let the moment say, This is a circus, then that would be the truth. If she let it say, This is a debut, then that would be true as well. The truth was a kite; it doesn’t fly unless you move.

The prototype rose three inches. It sank. Boom? No. A tap on the ground that made a sound like a large hand clapping politely in a hall. A piece of the crowd cheered anyway. Ron tried to be seen not cheering. The kid from the paper took his vertical video. The mayor kissed June on the cheek and whispered something Lark did not hear, and June’s face did something Lark had not seen on it since she was sixteen and her teacher had put a perfect score on a physics exam and then written "but where will you put this, June?" in the margin like an accusation.

“I will put it,” June had told that paper with her pencil, a little angrily, “in the air.”

“Do you want pie,” their father asked later because he had cooked two pies in a row for comfort and no matter the occasion pie was a rational response. Lark ate pie. June ate pie like fueling. Denise texted to say the video had been seen by 1.3 million strangers. Lark read the comments even though she knew not to. She cried anyway, not at the cruelty but at the strange kindnesses that come like postcards from people you will never meet who understand the shape of your problem like it’s a thing they can hold.

There were other moments in that first week that made a chapter: a small girl in a sparkly yellow dress who asked Lark to sign the inside of her book because her mother said you sign inside the cover if the person means it; a man who drove past and shouted “Quack-quack” as if this was the height of wit; the priest from the church with the red doors saying, “We are not hosting the launch, but we would love to bless the driveway if you think it would help,” and finding a way to make that sweet and not ridiculous. June hammered. Lark answered questions that no one had asked her in the same way twice before, she crafted yeses that weren't lies, not all the time.

Late the night before the second test, June sat with her feet in the plastic baby pool because she said the earth was too far away for her ankles. Lark leaned on the garage doorway. It was like that the best conversations found them—near tools, tired, unguarded.

“This might fail,” June said, into the pool’s small echo. “Not just this test, the whole thing. It might be an exercise that makes everyone think about how they end up back where they started. And I’ve spent everything. Not money. I mean the juice. The part of me that thinks new things. What if it goes quiet after this and I am just…,” she made a small motion with her hands, letting them fall, “someone who talked loudly about the sky.”

“You will not be just someone who talked,” Lark said. “You will be someone who tried. I hate that word too. It sounds like a mother telling you ‘eat the broccoli at least try it at least try.’ But I mean it like… like the part you keep for yourself. You will know. And I will know. Everyone else can go line up at Ron’s for their requested opinions.”

“Sometimes I wish you were meaner,” June said.

“I am,” Lark said. “Just not to you.”

The second test cut something open in the air and poured light through. For a breath it looked like a coin flicked up and maybe, maybe, maybe a miracle—that chorus of tiny parts—would sing. Three feet, four, six. People shouted like they were at a high school game they had been waiting to win for twenty years. June’s face opened. Lark’s body leaned toward the noise. The thing hung and then came back, slow enough to be called descent instead of drop. When it touched the ground the crowd exhaled as a creature and some of them realized they had been holding their phones and they looked down to check if their recording had happened like it was supposed to. The firefighter who had frowned earlier smiled. The mayor did a little dance. Ron started to walk away and then pretended he had always meant to walk.

June turned to Lark and raised both hands without words. Lark slapped them with hers and felt silly and happy, like a cheap version of God had given her permission to be outside of herself.

“It works,” June said. “It might work.”

“Everything works until it doesn’t and then it works again,” Lark said, choosing to be both cheerleader and philosopher because the moment allowed it. “Also, you will soon have to file so much paperwork.”

“Later. Now is for taking two pictures and making a face,” June said. She made a face. Lark took the pictures.

They celebrated by eating noodles from the place that had always been there and pretended to be new for the kids who came home from college. Lark sat on the curb with her takeout box and watched the sky become that weird Westfield purple. She could feel the planet turning, which was a trick she had learned from her grandmother: stand still, focus on the tall tree like it is fixed, and then let your mind decide the tree is holding still and you are, too, relative to it, so everything else becomes the thing that moves. When she did this, her fear felt like another sphere she might step off. Persuadable. Not cured. Never call it cured. That word steals maintenance.

A teen girl came up and said, “I liked you in 'Frontier Heart' and I liked that you screamed like a normal person when the ghosts came. Now they’re being mean because you screamed in a park. I think that’s stupid,” and Lark said thank you with a genuine thank and not a celebrity hearing her own line read. The town did what towns do: it made a place for her until it forgot to and then it remembered again.

Denise called one more time with that tone that meant a war council. “They offered you the barn-find romance,” she said, naming a script like you name a weather pattern. “The one where you find a car and a man and your true self all in a field with good lighting. There’s one scene with ducks in it but they said you can be doubled.”

“I’m not doing a duck double,” Lark said. “Also I’m not doing a barn find romance. I am not a woman who discovers that she loves manual labor only when a man touches her hands.”

“Okay,” Denise said, after a beat. “You’re also being offered an independent film by that director who always casts sharp women. Two scenes in a kitchen. A monologue that might break people. No animals except metaphorical. They pay you nothing and they will love you forever.”

“I want to help June,” Lark said. “I want to… I think I want this to be what matters.”

“You can do both,” Denise said. “You can’t do everything. Pick two. Not three. Two. The third will eat you.”

In bed that night, Lark tried to pick. She could feel the two on each shoulder like the old cartoons. Film and June. Fame and family. Or—cleaner names. Story and sky. Inside her, the ducks had found a different pond. They were quieter. They were still there. She had not defeated them like a hero in a cheap plot. She had done something else, which was to reorient her fear toward a different north. The new coin spinning in the dark was a thing June had set in motion and Lark could, if she wanted, keep that coin in the air with the one thing she had that wasn't gone: attention that bent other people's eyes.

In the morning, she wrote the director with the sharp women and said yes. She wrote Denise and said no to the barn car and the man and the field. She wrote the mayor and asked if they could find a way to keep the library open late on launch nights. She wrote to nobody the story about the man at the pond and his thin mercy and then she changed the endings until the ducks in it did nothing but drift like thoughts.

And she went to the garage and held the flashlight while June crawled under the belly of a thing that wanted to be dangerous so it could be useful, or useful so it could be beautiful—it was hard to untangle the words. She stood there with her arms up and the light steady and she thought, not about the movie she had turned down or the one she would do, but about a bus she had ridden once all the way to the end of the line when she had been thirteen and furious. She thought how good it had felt, the wheels making a long loud vowel out of the road. She pictured the bus pulled up at a curb she did not yet know, the driver looking in the mirror to see if anyone else would get off, the sign in front flashing OUT OF SERVICE and meaning it.

She moved the light a little to the left. “Here?” she asked.

“Right there,” June said. “Hold it right there. Don’t blink.”Chapter 3

The packages started arriving like cheerful apologies from strangers. They were tidy, stacked, taped with care as if the tape itself could be the balm. On the porch one morning there was a waterlogged box that had once been full of grapefruit, a bright purple bubble mailer, a brown envelope with a child’s handwriting that marched and listed like a troop. Inside: rubber ducks with sunglasses, rubber ducks with tiny capes, a ceramic duck with eyelashes like a car from the fifties, a hand-knit duck that had suffered a little in the mail and leaned forward like it needed a cane. There were notes, too, written on index cards and napkins and the backs of old school fliers. The notes had the cadence of confession. I’m scared of geese, wrote someone from Colorado. I can't stand balloons, wrote someone else, too much waiting for a pop. I faint when I see blood, said a nurse who kept a peppermint in her cheek and pinched her own thigh at the sight of a paper cut. June lined them up on the kitchen island until the island looked like a tiny, bright city founded on the premise that everything floatable should be honored for trying.

Denise texted Lark a picture of a billboard on Sunset that someone had altered: the ad originally for a perfume now had a duck sticker over the bottle and a speech bubble that said, quack if you love chaos. “We can sell this,” Denise said over the phone, not pretending at hello. “Not the duck thing—God deliver me from the duck thing—but the pivot. The sister with the rocket. The two of you against inertia. I’m getting DMs from three production companies who do docuseries with the word ‘intimate’ in the pitch deck. Also, the Fallon team will book you if you bring your sister, and they promise no animals, fake or otherwise.”

“I thought I wasn’t doing Fallon,” Lark said, walking a box in from the porch with one hip while holding the door with a knee because her hands were full of plush zoology.

“You weren’t,” Denise said briskly. “But America loves to revise. The meme fatigue cycle is approximately seventeen hours. Seize hour eighteen.”

“She’s building a rocket,” Lark said. “She’s not building a narrative arc for a ten-minute segment with a cutaway to Roots drummer applause.”

“Those are not mutually exclusive,” Denise said, and Lark could hear her typing, a soft wingbeat. “Listen. Don’t say yes yet. Don’t say no. Say you are considering. Meanwhile I want three clean images of June that look like the future without looking like the future is sponsored.”

Through the open doorway she saw June shirtless to her sports bra, her hair braided now because even practicality likes to feel contained, lifting the top shell of the cylinder with a friend’s help. The friend was a woman from June’s old robotics club in high school named Sita, and she had driven in from three towns over with a socket set most people would be happy to be buried with. Sita had a baby sleeping in a sling against her chest that breathed in small important ways as she torqued. The baby’s fingers flexed and opened around air, as if claiming it. Lark took the requested images. She framed the shot so the stroller wasn’t visible, not to erase anything but because she could feel it: the way a stranger would look at the picture and say, Woman works while mothering, and call it brave and then use the word as a handclap they could be done with. June’s face in the pictures made a third option. The muscle in her jaw spoke more truth than a caption could.

There was a flyer on the cafe corkboard that morning between a missing ferret and a notice for a book club that only read romance novels where someone was a ghost. “Town Listening Session,” the flyer said in the mayor’s assistant’s earnest font, all round vowels and optimism. “Proposed Demonstration: Municipal Arts and Innovation Project (Scalable Kinetics Installation), Public Safety Protocol, Q&A.” Someone had drawn in pen beside the official words: rockets?? and then, below that, a different hand had written yes rockets, we are the town, and then a third hand had written, if it explodes do we get to keep the pieces. Lark ordered her coffee and a lemon cookie that pretended to be a breakfast by having oats and sat in the corner where she’d once kissed a boy who had been interesting because he’d known all the names of the constellations and had not yet known the names of his own limits. The cafe radio did the thing small town radios do where they fold themselves around your years—a song from ten summers ago, a voice that had aged with you, a commercial for a basement waterproofing company that added ducks to the sound effects and then apologized with humor that never quite made the apology stick.

Pax Roscoe came in with a tray of donuts and a grin that was half salesman, half saint. He wore the hat again (20 METERS MAKES LIFE) and he shook Lark’s hand like he was a person who knew his strength. “I put a word in with the mayor about the fire line,” he said, as if saying the phrase “fire line” were a communion. “And a little something to the FAA woman so she knows we’re not trying to start a man-with-ideas nightmare.”

“FAA woman?” Lark said. She felt a small ripple across her stomach, a familiar one that meant the thing was getting bigger and real, and that she would have to be brave in the right direction.

“Inspector. Specialist. Person who knows which forms grow up to be other forms,” Pax said. “Name’s Irene. She’s been at Mojave and places where people look at air like land that hasn’t been claimed. You two will like each other. She uses the word ‘consequence’ like it’s a wheel you turn, not a punishment.”

June pretended not to listen but you could tell she was listening because she cleaned the same spot on the stainless twice. “Good,” she said eventually. “Irene is a name I trust.” She wrote it on the chalk wall under “things that can keep me from lighting the match” and then drew a small heart beside it like a dare to fate.

The town listening session was held in the library meeting room where they’d hosted many a bake sale and a poetry night and once, disastrously, a youth improv troupe whose only tool was shouting. Someone had painted the wall with a mural years before: a splash of pond water (of course the pond), a blue sky with birds (they were too round to be ducks, a gift), and children holding hands in a way that real children don’t, with earnest elbows. Folding chairs made their metal music. The mayor had learned how to speak into a microphone without flinching. She wore her hair up like a librarian who had once driven straight through the night because the road permitted it. “We are here to listen,” she said, and the way she said we contained all the ways a town is still a mess and a miracle at once.

Ron had a clipboard. Even his clipboard had a posture. He had collected signatures that said nothing on them except a name and the desire to be on the record against something. He stood up first like men in rooms have learned to do, and he waved the clipboard as if he could make the sound of his paper louder than the sound of an engine. “It’s a bad idea,” he said. “We live here. It’s noise and danger. There are birds. There are children. There are cars with paint that will get dust on them. There’s precedent. There’s liability. There’s my dog that barks at unusual frequencies. There’s my wife who has migraines.”

“Bring your wife to me,” said the woman behind Lark who turned out to be the town’s acupuncturist, soft-voiced, fierce. “We will fix her head and your dog can come too. And as for danger—aren’t you at least a little bored of not doing anything we can tell our grandkids about?”

A murmur traveled the room like the thought of weather. June stood when it was her turn and did not do the cuteness of apologizing. She was precise. “The fuel is not what you are imagining,” she said. “There is no mass driver. There is no bomb. The small violent part of this will be contained here,” she pointed to the diagram, “and the part that concerns your hearing will be managed here and here and with cones, and with distance. The worst case scenario is not even the worst case scenario you have already imagined. It is that this does a small hop and lands wrong and we have a dent. We have protocols. I will have Irene. I want to put a pretty thing in front of the library. When it has done what I want it to do, it will still be a pretty thing. Your taxes will not pay anything additional to what they are already paying for kids to draw and people to have a place to come when they can’t pay for internet.”

Her hands made shapes in the air while she talked, and the shapes were geometry that had learned to dance without embarrassment. Lark watched the room watch her and felt that small old jealousy that was not about attention but about certainty. When June finished, Lark couldn’t hold back. She stood up without knowing what her second sentence would be and decided to pretend this was a late-night segment of the good kind, the kind without a couch, the kind where you speak like a person rather than a person playing a person. “You don’t need me to tell you what fear feels like,” she said, and she saw heads tilt because anyone who had a knee or a grandparent had a fear. “You also don’t need me to tell you that you live here and it’s your town and you love it in the exact way that makes you put your name on a piece of paper that says no when something looks like it might rearrange your peace. But I want to borrow your attention for what a yes looks like. It looks like your kids seeing a thing that doesn’t apologize for wanting up. It looks like a day that isn’t the same as other days, and you being a part of that instead of watching it later on someone else’s screen and then pretending you’d been there. And, selfishly, it looks like a person like me, who you are generously tolerating at your grocery store, standing out there and not being afraid. Not because my fear is over, but because I chose to stand in another direction while it kept doing its job. That’s all. That’s my ask. I brought cookies.”

She had indeed brought cookies because a woman on the internet once told her that if you are going to ask a group for a favor, you should bring small sugary discs to confuse their lizard brains into saying yes with glucose. She held up the tin and felt ridiculous and also absolutely correct. The librarian beamed the librarian beam of people who know you can fix many things with sugar and shelves.

Irene came over afterward and introduced herself like someone who had drilled the introduction into a standard and then abandoned the standard for a handshake that actually meant yes. She had a streak of brilliant white through her otherwise dark hair and a nose that had been broken once in a story she didn’t tell. She wore a shirt that said AVOIDABLE INCIDENTS ARE MY LOVE LANGUAGE and she handed June a packet of forms that groaned under the saddle of their own acronyms. “I brought a simplified version,” she said in a voice that had taught many men how to listen. “We will still need the unsimplified version. I will help you write the words they want to hear without making you lie. You’ll give me a hazard analysis that looks like you know what wind can do to a person’s best intentions. You’ll show me a perimeter that’s not just cones and hope. You’ll tell me where your flame goes when it realizes it can’t go where it wanted to. In exchange I’ll keep the feds from loving you to death with concern.”

“And what do you want besides the absence of paperwork sins?” June asked, her eyes alive because here was a person who liked language and engines in equal measure.

“I want my kid,” Irene said, nodding toward a lanky human in a black hoodie who was pretending not to be her kid near the young adult shelves, “to see a woman in a welding mask be the cause of a road closure for a good reason. And I want to watch a room full of men recalibrate how they classify the sound of competence.”

The signatures on Ron’s clipboard were many and also, Lark noticed, the same six names written twice. Sita strolled past and said, casually and on purpose, “Ron, bring your dog to the test. If it barks at unusual frequencies we can calibrate your neighbor’s wind chimes,” and then kissed the baby on the temple and left the room fragranced with almond oil and a small future.

Tamara came back from Santa Fe with different hands. They were still her hands, strong and ornamental, but they seemed less in love with mess and more in love with the form that a mess dreams of becoming. She put her bag down in the hallway and hugged both the girls, making an equal sign of her arms, then stepped back to look at the line of ducks on the counter. “You could glaze these,” she said, picking up one of the ceramic ones. “You could make a flotilla with a finish that would make anyone forgive anything. But I suppose forgiveness is not the real project here.” She scratched her neck thoughtfully, which was a tell that she was remembering something she hadn’t wanted to remember. “Did I ever tell you about the kiln that failed the night before the gallery opening?” she said, moving into a story like you move into a pool—one foot, then the other. “I had my pieces inside. I’d named them like they were children. The firing stalled halfway and the glazes blistered. I cried like people cry over the truly lost. Then I took a shard to the light and it was somehow better for the accident. It reflected wrong. The owner of the gallery put it in the window and people came in for the shards. They called them honest. I wanted to punch everyone and also kiss them. That’s how a near catastrophe sometimes behaves.”

“Are you saying you want the rocket to blister?” June said.

“I’m saying I recognize the look on your face,” Tamara said. “And I know the high after the near miss. And I know the crash after the high. And I brought you both New Mexico candy that tastes like a church smells.” She went to the cabinet precisely where she hadn’t left anything and put away her mug as if she had never left at all.

At night, when the house was a small boat in a very friendly sea, Lark stood outside on the patch of concrete that had been chalk-painted a hundred times by a hundred small hands. The heat had gone out of the day and she could feel, if she let her skin do some listening, the way the neighborhood exhaled. She thought about the docuseries offers and the way a camera could make a feast of something and leave bones. She thought about her career which in certain circles was described as a list of intentional choices, when really it had been a series of doors opening because she was standing near them when someone else got tired of holding them up. She thought about the small boy by the pond who had somehow given her more kindness in ten seconds with his eyebrows than strangers on the internet had in several frustrated days. She did not think about ducks. She thought about speed.

The tests proliferated like small holidays. The town learned how to gather without demanding a parade. Children learned words that you do not need to know until you need to know them: ablative, thrust, throttle, abort. Irene stood with her arms folded like a general and learned the names of everyone under twelve within twenty feet of the tape. The tape was not really tape, it was a suggestion; the town obeyed because it likes being asked by a person who sounds like an answer. The prototype hopped again and again, each hop a new paragraph, each landing a small plausible grace. A man from the state called with a voice that said he had been asked to be mean. He asked questions as if the questions could be warmer if he held them long enough under his breath. June answered in two languages at once: the language of compliance, the language of honesty. Lark watched the transaction with a fascination she had once reserved for two actors who dislike each other kissing in one take.

Between hop days, life shrank and steadied. Lark went to the grocery store and learned again which aisle the beans were in, because in every town the beans are somewhere different based on the logic of a manager who has a quiet philosophy about legumes. She chose the independent film and read the script on the back steps, stopping sometimes to make her mouth practice saying the long lines with the kind of ease that would make them sound like borrowed everyday thought. The script was good enough to make her jealous of the writer in a way that felt like respect. The director called and asked her about hunger and silence. Lark told her about the ducks and then wished she hadn’t, not because it made her smaller, but because it made her story sound like a hook on which people could hang what they already believed about her. “No animals,” the director said, laughing softly. “Just knives and soup.” She meant the monologue, which had both.

June started keeping a failure budget in chalk on the wall, which was both a joke and a devotional practice. Under the words she wrote numbers that stood for how many times it would be allowed to go wrong before the going wrong meant stop. She ended the list with an arrow that pointed to a sheet of paper pinned neatly: CATASTROPHIC, which was a word you can’t say out loud in a suburb without someone flinching. She flinched. Then she put her finger under the arrow like a lawyer making a case to a jury and said, “We won’t go there.” Tamara touched her face with two fingers like she was anointing her with the idea.

When the third test day finally announced itself by arriving without apology, Westfield wore its best blue. The air was the kind that made old men say words like crisp and then mime the act of biting a fruit. Irene set out the perimeter like a prayer rug. She had orange markers and a tape measure and a certain stillness in her body that made children quiet themselves within radius. Pax brought the donuts again and also coffee that steamed like a promise. The mayor had learned and now wore flat shoes because she had turned her ankle at the last hop and then laughed about it in a way that made her instantly re-electable. Ron had brought his dog, a beagle who had eyes that apologized in advance for anything that might go wrong. There was blessedly not a duck in sight. It was as if the town had drafted a memo and sent it down to the pond shore asking politely for civic kindness.

Lark took her place by the cones with a half-familiar sensation, the one that came when a hundred eyes would roam over a room and then decide to stop on her because stopping on her made sense with the story they had brought. She was good at making that pause feel right. She let the story be the rocket, be the whoosh that was a possibility and not a promise. She kept her mouth shut the way she had learned to before takes so she didn’t waste the breath she would need in the scene. She made her face into something that told children this was safe enough and told the old men this was serious. She did not look at the horizon because sometimes the horizon takes and sometimes it gives, and today she needed it to give.

June strapped on the helmet even though it wasn’t a helmet yet so much as a habit. She ran her hand over the side panels the way you do when you love a thing you made, which is to say with a small motion that would not be noticeable if you did not know how to love. Sita stood five feet away with her hand on the kill switch because some friendships are built on the agreement that you will be the person who stops the thing before it becomes a story at a funeral. Irene caught Lark’s eye and nodded once, the nod that says: this is the moment I earn my salary and you earn nothing and we both get paid in the same currency anyway.

The engine sounded like a creature clearing its throat kindly. It was not a roar yet; it was a request to the air to consider a new arrangement. Lark held herself very still in a way she had learned while holding seventeen-pound gowns on red carpets until her vertebrae sang. The rocket lifted the way a person gets up from a broken chair, careful, cheeky. A boy, maybe the one from the skate park, let out a yelp that made his mother put her hand on his head as if to keep his skull from flying off with excitement. June’s eyes were not on the rocket. They were on her own instruments, the ones she had taped to the inside of her brain and the cheap ones wired to the side with zip ties. The thing rose higher than it had any right to and then hung in the way that makes you think time is a human invention, which of course it is.

Someone in the back of the crowd shouted, in that tone a certain kind of local man uses to keep time on his side, “Look out!” and several heads turned in the wrong direction because evolution still has a sense of humor. The wind shifted. It was the smallest betrayal. A leaf flicked from a maple and crossed through the plume like a dare. Lark braced because there are habits the body keeps and one of them is learning how to catch yourself before you fall in front of people. From nowhere and not nowhere at all, two mallards arrowed across the far end of the cul-de-sac, green heads small with distance, bodies cut tight like a bow on the idea. They chose the sky as the thing deserving of their morning and did not consult anyone’s phobias or plans. Nobody but Lark saw them because the rocket had stolen the scene. She felt the old flicker inside—a little harmless electrical storm—and then she noticed, miraculously, that it didn’t co-opt the rest of her. The fear had a seat with a belt on, just as June had promised. The rest of her kept its job.

The rocket stuttered, a half hiccup, and June murmured something to it that sounded like a lover’s private encouragement. Sita’s finger hovered just above the switch in the way of people who make choices with millimeters. Irene watched the arc with eyes that counted liabilities and sons. The beagle barked once and then put his head down, satisfied that he had said what any dog must say in the face of hubris and fire. Ron, perhaps against his will, let a grin flicker on his mouth like a contraband flame.

It climbed. It came back. It landed with a soft thud that you could describe to a person who loved baseball as a perfect catch. There was a beat where you could hear the small, precise glitter of metal cooling, and then the town made a noise that was equal parts fairground and church. Lark clapped and yelled and felt like her organs had arranged themselves in a way doctors would applaud. June lifted both fists and then softened, because one of the little kids started to cry from the suddenness of relief, and June is the kind of person who can shape adrenaline into a consoling hand in two seconds. She crouched and said, “It’s loud because it’s alive. Loud is not always bad,” and the child hiccuped and imprinted a little on the idea.

The moment after a thing works is the most dangerous moment. This is a law. You can ruin a good cake by being too sure, you can ruin a marriage by assuming you’ve already done the hard part, you can ruin a delicate truce with your own mind by thinking, finally, that you are free of the old alarms. June knew the law. She had written the law on the chalkboard under the failure budget. She redirected the adrenaline into the only ritual that keeps gods pacified: she did the checklist. She put a hand on a valve; she thanked it; she told Sita to cut power like it was a bedtime story. When she stood up, she didn’t look toward cameras or the mayor. She looked at Lark and Lark did that thing with her mouth that millions of people had incorrectly read as a secret, a coyness. It wasn’t coy. It was an attempt not to cry in public, and she failed at it completely.

After, in the wake, when donuts were eaten with reverence and the baby slept through the congratulations and a boy asked if he could touch the scorch mark and then bragged to no one and everyone that he had touched the scorch mark, Irene took June’s hand in both of hers in a gesture that made Lark’s throat get soft. “You have something rare,” Irene said. “Not the metal. The quiet where the decisions live. If anyone tries to buy it from you, call me and I will bring you a baseball bat.” She meant it. The mayor speechified briefly, using words like legacy and we which hit differently when you’d watched her wince after stepping off a curb wrong and then laugh her way through the day. Ron put his clipboard down somewhere and forgot to pick it up. Pax Roscoe took the clipboard and wrote on it: LET THE RECORD SHOW, and then a smiley face, because sometimes the record needs punctuation.

By late afternoon, the town had put itself away in its usual drawers. The cones stacked. The signs went into the trunk of the mayor’s car, where there were already three folding chairs, a jumper cable, a pair of heels, and a spoon. Lark’s father started slicing melon. Tamara set glazes on the table like they were guests. June washed her hands with the exactitude of a surgeon and then, without ceremony, brought out a small box and put it in front of Lark as if she’d been saving the gesture for when a place in the day opened where it could sit without clutter.

“I made you something,” she said, in that tone that offered the thing and a small apology for the fact of it. “It’s not a charm. It is not a talisman. If it works, it will work because you decide to let a thing work.”

Inside was a necklace with a pendant the exact size of a clock face on a doll’s wall. The pendant had been cut from a test scrap of the skin of the rocket, which gave it a brushed dignity. June had etched a circle on it and then the tiniest of notches along the edge, like a compass rose without the drama. In the center there was a small glass dome, and under the dome a sliver of something green and ridiculous that caught the light. “What’s the green,” Lark asked, her voice doing that breaking thing it did when the moment got bigger than her ribcage permitted.

“A piece of a duck decoy,” June said, her smile tilted. “From the sporting goods at the thrift, because I refused to take anything from a real thing that didn’t volunteer. I fixed it there, under the dome, so it can’t look at you. You can look at it instead. Or not. If you don’t want to wear it, don’t. I will not be offended. I’ll put it on the wall and call it art and say it’s about the tension between fear and propulsion and then I’ll charge five hundred dollars and some person will buy it because they think it will make them interesting. But I made it for you.”

“It’s terrible,” Lark said, and then, because honesty does not have to be cruel, added, “and beautiful.” She fastened it. The metal was cool and then warm because that is what metal does when you give it the intimacy of skin. She felt not braver, exactly, but held. That was a dangerous word and also the correct one.

“Do we tell the internet,” Denise asked over FaceTime that night, because even in Westfield the internet came to sit on the couch like an old aunt with opinions. “Do we reveal the weird amulet. Do we give them a title card: The Actress And The Rocket Maker? Do I call the woman from Vogue who loves women in overalls?”

“Whatever we tell them,” Lark said, aiming the phone near but not at her actual face, “we tell them we are busy and any story they require has to fit between the parts where the work happens. We give them the picture of the scorch mark and a sentence that says, ‘the point was not the landing, the point was the choice to light.’ And then we go to sleep.”

“Poetry,” Denise said, mock-woeful and proud. “I will make it into copy and pretend it was my idea and the cycle of our relational economy will continue. Are you ready for the indie film? They moved your dates up because their funding got skittish and then came back with a new tattoo. There’s a kitchen scene where the block of knives is on the wrong side of the stove. Please do not fix it on set with your hands. We will get a note from props.”

“I will stand very still and tell the truth as invented by someone with more patience than me,” Lark said quietly. “And then I will come back for the next thing June asks me to hold.”

The night was deep in a way cities never allow. The frogs did their scalable symphony. Across the street, the teen drummer’s timing had finally clicked, and he was trying triplets like a person who’d been healed by repetition. The ducks at the pond were probably asleep with half their minds open, keeping an eye on something nobody could identify in broad daylight. Lark lay on her back in her old-not-old room and watched the ceiling fan do its slow three-blade sermon. The necklace sat at her throat. She touched the dome with one finger until her heartbeat found the glass and the glass said: yes, I hear you. She thought about how, as a child, she had believed the moon followed the car because she was in it, and how nobody had said, gently or not, that the moon had other business than her. Now, older, she believed the moon was following everyone because that is how light likes to behave when it hears laughing. She turned her head and saw the silhouette of the rocket through the blind, not a column of ambition anymore but the quiet shape of a thing that had done what it had promised for a day. She didn’t know what the next day would demand. That was the mercy. The whole of the future would kill you if you had to carry it all at once. The next morning only asked for coffee, and an email to the director, and a joke for Irene about filing cabinets learning to breed if left alone, and a list of groceries you could get in town without anyone saying anything about anything except the weather.

“Tomorrow,” June said from the hallway because she was a person who believed in the spell of that word and said it like it could be carved. “Tomorrow we try fire on purpose again. Then after that, wind. Then after that, who knows, maybe we build a boat just to confuse people.”

“Do not give Ron a second petition subject,” Lark said, her laugh hushed because the house was sleeping under blankets of time. “But fine. A boat. I want to learn stars enough to name the going.”

“For now,” June said, and Lark could hear her palms press together out of habit, “hold the light when I say the word.”

“I will,” Lark said, and the way she said it closed the day with a click that felt like a lid fitting the right jar. She slept as if the world had been re-threaded around her with care, and if a duck passed through her mind it did so at a distance, a small green fact under glass, too busy paddling its half-dream to arrive at the shore of her.Chapter 5

The day taught itself to be wind before noon. Flags decided to be important, backs of shirts breathed without permission, and every leaf on the block showed its paler underside like it was practicing vulnerability. June slept for three hours like a soldier and then came up from the garage with her hair in two braids and a list, the kind of list that contained both wrenches and strategies. Irene arrived with a coil of caution tape and a bright orange windsock that had clearly had a life on a real field somewhere, its mouth a perpetual surprised O. Pax rolled over a fan on a dolly that he had rebuilt out of a factory reject and an old airplane prop and he apologized to it in advance in case it was about to be asked to lie about the direction of the world.

Lark was fresh off a morning of pretending in a kitchen that wasn’t hers. The independent film had found a house two towns over with pale blue cabinets and a view of a soybean field that made everything look like it existed for someone’s nostalgia. The director, Mara, had set the knives block on the wrong side of the stove deliberately, and whenever Lark’s hand reached for it the prop master’s eyebrow would rise like a curtain warning. She kept her hand to herself and put the extra wanting into the way she looked at the actor playing her sister in the scene, who had the kind of coiled intensity that makes casting agents write her name with a little star. The monologue about soup had been shot in two takes because Mara disliked bravery wasted on practice. It had started as a woman describing broth and ended as a neat autopsy of a marriage, and Lark had felt the weight of the pendant on her sternum the way a person feels the suggestion of a seatbelt even when they are standing. When she was done, Mara had come in close and whispered, “It’s a gift when you let a line be ugly before it’s beautiful,” and Lark had nodded like a confession had just rearranged the bones in her face.

She got home just as the windsock decided west, almost, and a little lazy. June handed her a lemon popsicle without looking like she’d planned it hours ago, and the sour chased the filming taste from her mouth so fast she laughed. “We’re going to fake wind first, and then we’re going to beg the real stuff to show us its personality,” June said, pointing with her popsicle as if it were a baton. “Pax’s Frankenfan from the boneyard, Irene’s sock, Sita’s new handheld anemometer that I promised her I would not lick no matter how much it looks like a strange lollipop. We’ll practice yaw control with no altitude so if we do something dumb we can call it deliberate.”

Ron came by to let his dog sniff the cones as if the cones needed to be interrogated by law. He had found another clipboard, because the species reproduces, and this one had a printed sheet on top with the words CITIZENS FOR SENSIBLE SKY written in a font that tried to look like authority and looked instead like a sign for a discount carpet store. Parsons from Parks ducked his head in as well, a gentle man with tall ears who had the keys to the gates nobody else thought about. He said, “We got a call from a woman saying the ducks are showing signs of stress. She said it like it was a thing you can diagnose by looking at a picture on your phone of a bird that doesn’t know it’s being watched. I told her the ducks’ primary source of stress is bread and teenagers. Then I told her I’d come see for myself, which is me trying to be a modern man. Don’t worry about your afternoon. Just… if any sound happens, keep it to a song where the chorus is brief.”

Irene took a moment to stand in the driveway and calibrate the air in her bones. She didn’t check the forecast on her phone so much as confirm what her body already believed. “Here’s the deal,” she said, not waiting to be introduced to the room that knew her now without ceremony. “Your left is going to be a liar all day, so anything that wants to yaw left will do it more than it thinks it should. If you can, agree to make the dumb choice with speed instead of smart choice with doubt. Doubt gets you a bruise when wind’s involved. We have a soft abort that’s prettier than last week. Sita, that switch is your religion. Pax, if you plug anything into that power strip that wasn’t on it this morning, I will make you write me an essay about cord ratings.”

“What’s the title of the essay,” Pax asked, grinning in that way that men grin when a steady woman takes their tools away and they love her for it.

“How to Not Burn Down Friendship,” Irene said, and the grin went reverent.

Lark set the social world to quiet the way you dim a lamp by twisting, slow, until your fingers know where to stop. Denise had sent twelve messages in the last hour, even though it was a weekday and she should have had half an agency between her mouth and her thumbs. There were offers that used words like unscripted and authentic and journey, and there was one email from a streaming platform whose logo looked like something you would see on a skate shoe, promising a “limited series” about two women and a town and a rocket that would “lean into the messy middle.” Lark read the pitches and then closed her email because Irene had said doubt gets you a bruise, and she had enough already. She walked to the edge of the driveway and looked toward the pond without trying to make anything dramatic out of it. It was there, doing what water does in wind, which is to develop scales that catch light and make people talk like the water is breathing differently. She didn’t see any ducks at that moment, which either meant they were elsewhere or that they were practicing being rocks, which is a talent the species uses for survival and mischief.

They staged the wind day like a play with no audience and as many understudies as possible. The fan roared and found its footing, Pax baby-talking it without shame until the prop found a groove that improved the mood of the cones. Sita had strapped the anemometer onto a broom so she could hold it in the actual path of the fake gusts without losing her hair. June squinted and then made herself open both eyes wide because she’d written on the board that you see more when your face is not inventing a reason to make drama. The first gentle push of air tested a hinge; it juddered and then yielded like a polite uncle backing through a doorway. The second shove nicked a wire that hadn’t been told the day’s plan, and the wire complained by vibrating in a key that made Irene hiss and mark something on her clipboard that wasn’t Ron’s, a nicer clipboard with the corners taped to hold itself together in storms. By the third, June was adjusting in real time in a way that looked like dance, hands and shoulders and the numerical part of her brain making agreements faster than anyone could write them down.

Then the wind Wendy’d itself in for real, an indulgent swirl from the west, and June made the call to lift a foot off the ground. It was not altitude. It was a hover on a creaky barstool, the kind of lift that makes neighbors go, “Is it… is it up,” and then answer their own question with a helpful “oh.” The cross-breath of the day hit the belly of the thing and the thing responded with a swagger, the ugly cousin of grace, wobbling with intent. Sita’s finger didn’t quake over the switch; it poised. Lark watched June watching her instruments and saw the moment the math and the mess parted company like good friends leaving a party at different times. A bolt on the lower port strut—a bolt that had lived a quiet life until wind entered the chat—settled into a new opinion of its purpose and decided, in classic hardware fashion, that it could travel. It didn’t go far. It hopped like a rabbit who’d read a book about parkour and then found itself in the world of real concrete.

The sound when the strut kissed the driveway was a sound you wouldn’t include in a movie because the foley artist would say no one would believe a thing that small could make a noise that tired. It was a small tired sound, a complaint with a pinch of resignation, and it brought the test down hard enough that a piece of a panel—light, but metal is always itself even when it’s light—flew off at an angle that would have made a geometry teacher clap with delight. It hit the edge of Ron’s truck, which had been parked per Ron’s insistence within the perimeter because it was his right to park on a public street he’d been parking on since Carter. The panel left a dent the size and shape of a dull smile near Ron’s wheel well, and the beagle barked as if its union contract demanded it.

Nobody screamed. Sita hit the switch with the love of a woman who knows stopping is a form of affection. June breathed in hard enough that her ribs showed—Tamara’s potter’s instinct noticed even if nobody else would—and then squatted to look at the bolt like she was a detective reading a confession. Irene’s eyes did a quick inventory of children and men and mayor ankles and wires and wind, and then she took the clipboard and wrote in large letters: IMPROPER TORQUE PATH + WIND = STUPID. Pax killed his fan and petted it once, whispering, “you tried,” as if he were putting a kitten to bed. Ron came forward slow, not because he was afraid but because you walk to a dent the way you walk to a piece of news. He bent, put his hand over the smile in the metal, pressed like he could persuade the truck to remember its previous face, then stood and sighed in a tone nobody expected.

“It’s a truck,” he said. “It goes places where things bump into it. If I wanted it to be a statue I’d park it in my living room and call it a day.” He flicked the panel with his knuckles and watched the light go through it like it had been made to show off that trick. “You’ll fix it,” he added, and it wasn’t a question. June nodded, almost bowed, because there are people it feels appropriate to bow to and one of them is the one who just decided not to make your mistake their headline.

“Torque plan was arrogant,” June admitted, which was not the kind of sentence a person says at a town meeting. “I built for perfectly vertical and then tried to teach sideways to become a courtesy. Sideways never becomes a courtesy just because you ask.”

“Sideways is my cousin’s entire personality,” Irene said, deadpan. “I will mail you a new plan and I will also remind you, again, to let someone else check your body’s math when you think the math is you.” She pointed at Lark with the tone of a coach, not a critic. “You. Take her to walk while everyone un-primes their adrenaline. Look at things that aren’t moving. Water, fine. Tree, better. Your own shoes, best.”

They walked without pretending it wasn’t because the adrenaline needed a place to dissolve. The wind had the bright taste of before a storm without the storm. The pendant sat quiet against Lark’s chest as if it were listening to a story it had heard before and would hear again. They cut along the back way so as not to take the pond path, then turned in anyway because avoidance is a convincing god until it isn’t. There was a boy practicing throwing a tennis ball against the low stone wall and catching it awkwardly, the social language of boys working out how to keep their hands in the world. There was a woman with a stroller talking to a man with a hat and neither of them saying what the conversation was really about, which is the music of small towns. The ducks were across the water near the reeds, subdued by the wind, heads tucked like old men on trains, and Lark watched them the way you watch weather you might need to drive in. They did not cross in front of her mind. They stayed pinned to their page. She breathed. June asked her about the filming, because June believes in rescue by detail, and Lark said, “The soup was onion, but I didn’t cry until after, and then I cried the way you do when your body has been holding a door shut for an hour and somebody else finally puts their shoulder to the wood.”

June nodded and picked a twig off a bush without hurting the bush and said, “Mara knows where the seam is between hunger and speech. Of course she put the knives on the wrong side. She was training your wrists to argue more quietly. Do you like your scene partner,” and Lark smiled with her mouth more than her eyes because she didn’t want to be cruel. She liked the girl fine, she liked the way the girl worked harder when no one was watching, but she did not like the hunger the girl had about Fame, which was a capital letter that eats its friends.

When they came back, the present had decided not to become an emergency. Sita was holding the bolt under a lamp like it owed her money. Pax had the dent on Ron’s truck halfway tamed with a plunger and the kind of good humor that makes a man a local treasure. Irene had her phone out because someone above her line of report had texted, and she was writing things with brevity and affection that would keep her and June both from being eaten by concern. Tamara had put out cut-up peaches with a squeeze of lime and people were using toothpicks in the way that makes them feel like they are taking part in a civilized compromise. The mayor came, saw the dent, saw June’s face doing the thing her face did when she was making a mea culpa into a tool, and said, “We live here and so do our mistakes. If we start punishing anything that tries, we will end up a town of perfect lawns and nothing else.”

After the wind school, the internet tried to have its day. A Facebook group with a name like WESTFIELD REAL TALK posted a video that someone had slowed down and color-corrected until the plume looked unimaginably sinister, and a caption that said “birds terrified???” with the kind of punctuation you can taste like a sour candy. Someone tagged Lark in a comment that read, “wow, thought u loved animals,” which was such an obvious trap the community college could have used it to teach rhetoric. Denise texted, “We can correct gently with a video of Irene explaining how ducks hear through skulls and how low frequencies work, with a graphic of a duck in headphones. Or we can ignore and the fire burns itself out because it’s Saturday and there’s a little league tournament, which is your town’s natural resource.” Lark sent it to June and Irene and asked for the hymn they wanted to sing and not the one the hecklers wanted.

“Let Irene sing,” June said. “But make it about neighbors and decibels and the way we learn to share air. No cute. The minute you go cute about animals the world will demand you bottle it.”

Irene filmed a minute-odd video standing next to the windsock, speaking in the dry, declarative voice of a woman who has taught men not to die with fewer syllables than they expected. She explained SPLs and distance and how long the tests really ran and how no living thing in the vicinity had had its habits altered beyond a brief curiosity peck in the direction of the cones. Lark posted it without filter and with a caption that said, “If you have questions, ask us. We live here too.” It wasn’t a balm for everyone, but it gave the reasonable something to hold while the unreasonable tired themselves with misuse of commas.

A package came that evening with a return address with NASA in it, the letters printed on the label like an official hand had been attached. Inside was a note in a looping hand addressing June by first name like the writer trusted the world to be smaller than it is. I sewed parachutes for years, the note said, in a sentence that made anyone who read it straighten their shoulders slightly without knowing why. We packed air like a prayer and then we packed fabric like the air had manners. People think courage is a moment, but it’s a thousand stitches. I would like to send you a box of thread I can’t use anymore because my fingers are getting honest about their age. It’s strong and too pretty to hide. The signature was a name that Irene recognized because she put her hand over her mouth briefly, and then she said, “She used to stand two doors down from me in Mojave and tell the boys to move their coffee. The only person in that hangar whose voice could travel through aluminum and stay itself.”

They ate pie again because their father had decided to turn his love language into a taper he could keep lit. After pie, he brought down a box from far back in a closet with the care a person uses for an object they have not told themselves is sacred so as not to tempt theft by fate. The box had old photos and the smell of closets that have seen winter coats hang themselves into shapes and then collapse into summer. There were pictures of Lark’s mother that made the girls look like elongated versions of something fragile and ferocious, like a dragonfly wing sized up to a kite. There was a note in their mother’s hand that Tamara hadn’t known she’d left behind, tucked in a book of household jokes like a woman’s idea of camouflage. Luck is noticing the door and then deciding you deserve to test the knob, the note said, and Lark ran her two fingers over the ink like she was petting the idea. The wedding dress story got told, the Dairy Queen cone got remembered and embellished with the exact number of sprinkles because memory likes to be precise when it is lying with love, and nobody made grief into a performance because the house had learned over time to keep its dead very close and very gentle.

The first docuseries producer flew in and rented a car and used the phrase “tasteful access” in a way that made Lark picture a salad fork being introduced to her bedroom. He sat at Pax’s radio shop to make his pitch because he believed in local color as a marketing strategy, and Pax sold him a pocket AM/FM while he talked as if in punishment for using the phrase “normal people” within Irene’s hearing. June listened to the man outline a schedule of tears and triumphs and then asked him if he knew the difference between a static test and a hop. When he did not, even after being told twice, she handed him the anemometer and an orange cone and said, “I think you should stand in the backyard and see what the air believes. It’s not going to make for good television, but it will make you a better animal.” He did not like being made into a better animal by a woman in a t-shirt with scorch marks, and Lark, who had once pleased men like this for a living, felt the specific pleasure of letting someone else not please him.

Denise, who could smell a deal in a different zip code by turning her head, called later and said, “We will say yes if and only if we get to control the time window, the crew count, and the refusal list. Your father will not be filmed waking up from a nap in his chair. Tamara will not be filmed in that way some shows like to film older women, with the camera too close and the light like punishment. Irene will be mic’d only if she wants to be the day she wants to be, and if she says ‘no’ they will cut the audio and use birds. You, Lark, will not be asked to cry in a close-up for a time when a stiffness bolt goes missing. If any of this is a problem, I will personally write an email that uses the word exploitative so correctly that they will print it out and keep it under a rock.” Lark said she would consider it and meant it in the literal sense, not the Hollywood sense where consider is another word for never.

June repurposed the rubber ducks—which had taken over a corner of the living room like a bright militia—by sticking straight pins with tiny flags into their backs and dropping them into a shallow tray to map turbulence. She poured water from a watering can with the spout turned to a trickle and watched the way the water learned to creep around obstacles like a mind finding another way to think around a fact. She labeled the ducks in marker—Laminar, Vortex, Wake—and Lark, catching sight of them like that, laughed in a way that wasn’t brave or sad or branded. It was simply relief that even a thing that had frightened her so completely could be conscripted to show them where the air would try to go.

The boy with the eyebrows showed up with a screwdriver in his pocket and an expression that said he had been sent by twelve versions of himself to see if anybody needed him. His name was Eli, he said, and then he said, “I know Eli is a name that makes you think of kids in old books being nice to women in bustles, but I can carry heavy and I know how to be quiet.” He ran messages from the cones to the garage and back without assuming any of his own messages would be wanted. He drew a duck on the chalkboard, not with malice but because he was fourteen and funny, and then, seeing Lark’s face flicker, he crossed it out and turned it into a rocket with a beak, laughing hard at his own apology. She let herself laugh too because the body wants to be forgiven for things it never did.

There were two days of rain that felt like a rehearsal for years they hadn’t planned for. The town turned inward in that way that makes everyone learn the sound of their own dryer again. Lark shot nights on the indie in a kitchen lit to look like morning, the kind of trick filmmaking likes to play so the audience will feel warm and then not know why they are crying. During a setup where nothing would settle into the white balance everyone wanted, Mara leaned against the fridge and asked Lark about the pendant like she was asking why Lark wore a particular scar. Lark told her the short version—a duck under glass, a sister making a compass, a problem made small enough to wear—and Mara said, “Keep it for the soup scene,” even though the soup scene was done, because directors often mean keep it forever when they say keep it for a scene.

On the third morning after wind school, a letter came from the state with the tone of a person who didn’t want to meet but would, and the word HEARING in capital letters like someone tried to make it shout from the paper. Irene read it, rolled her neck, and said, “We’ll go and we’ll talk about the thing we’re actually doing while they try to talk about the thing they are afraid someone will do with our name. Wear something with pockets. Bring a donut. I will make you three lists: what they want to hear, what we need to say, and what they’ll actually remember.” June sharpened a pencil with a pocketknife because sharpening a pencil with a blade is a mood and a choice. Lark asked if she should come and June said, “Yes, but not because you are… you know. You should come because you are very good at stopping a man whose story is about to confuse him. I want you to look at the room the way racks look at a runway. Pick three people and fill their hands with a reason to nod.”

The hearing was held in a building with carpet that had been installed during a decade when gray was code for serious, and it smelled like everyone’s coats, layer upon layer. A panel sat under a row of flags as if they were expecting a parade to enter if the answers weren’t satisfactory. Two men asked questions in the tone of a dentist explaining the economy of floss. A woman with exquisite eyeliner asked about combustible zones with a curiosity that suggested she had burned things under appropriate supervision before. June spoke in sentences that did not apologize for their own breath. Irene fielded changes of subject the way you field bees you do not want to harm and do not want in your hair. Lark watched the back row, where the man who would write the brief leaned against the wall and tried to pretend he made the shape of a telephone pole. She aimed every yes toward his peripheral vision, because sometimes people are proudest of the things they did not notice they learned.

On the way back, June drove because her hands needed a task and Lark watched the fields do what fields do after rain, which is to shine with gratitude and pretend it is their doing. They saw a line of cars stopped in both directions near the pond and for a moment Lark thought something had gone wrong with a child or a dog or the duck that had yet to be forgiven for simply existing in her mind. It wasn’t a horror. It was an old small ritual. A row of mallards hustled across the road, their bodies smug with purpose, and the drivers of Westfield did the thing the town taught them to do: they sighed and waited and then told the story later like the ducks did it just to test whether humanity still deserved to be trusted with steering wheels. Lark put her hand to the pendant because she is not a woman who makes herself ache out of stubbornness, and then she watched the green heads bob, one, two, seven, and let the fear tap her like a stranger trying to be introduced. It tapped. She nodded. She looked away deliberately toward the creek that ran under the culvert, and in her peripheral vision she could feel the flock pass and the world resume.

June touched her arm once, nothing a camera could have captured without being accused of adding a violin. “Seatbelt tight,” June said, as if they were at thirty thousand feet and someone had broken out a harmonica in the next row. Lark smiled and tried to see herself from the outside and then stopped because that is a trick that eats the day.

Denise called with the inevitable contract. Fallon wanted them next Thursday, remote to begin with, a segment from the library lawn with the sculpture-that-was-a-rocket framed so the sponsor wouldn’t complain about free advertising for something the town hadn’t yet branded. “They will go easy,” Denise promised in a voice that contained both skepticism and love. “They will ask you about sisters. They will ask you about fear. They will ask you to hold a rubber duck they will pretend to produce as a joke and then reveal it is a candle, not a toy, which their legal told them is okay. They will not send live poultry because their intern has your email where you wrote ‘do this and I will replace all your curls with bees.’ Pick your shirt. Pick your line you’ll say when they laugh in the wrong place. Don’t pick a fight with America on a Thursday.”

They said yes because some hells are useful bridges. Lark wrote her lines and then deleted her lines because Mara had reminded her that truth dies when you pre-dig the grave too neatly. June wrote an index card and then tore it in half and then used the halves to shim a fixture in the garage because paper can be a tool even when it refuses to be a guide. Irene called a friend at the network to say, quietly, that if any surprises occurred during the segment she would appear in New York uninvited with a bar of soap and a mom voice. Pax polished the face of his ham radio in case any of the high schoolers wanted to try to bounce a signal off the ionosphere during the commercial break, which feels magical even when you know the math. Tamara made glazes and then pretended to be outraged by the very idea of TV and then paused Astronaut Wives to watch an old clip of Sally Ride, because we are all hypocrites when someone brave is on.

That night, before sleep, the house settled like a ship in friendly water. Lark lay awake with the fan marking time and the necklace warming to the temperature of her hope. She thought about the shape of Thursday and how it could either take a piece of her or put something back. She thought about the state hearing and the panel and the woman with eyeliner and the way June had learned to cut the size of her explanations in half only to make them twice as clear. She thought, for a small, superstitious minute, about the version of herself who had stayed in a city that isn’t a town and had learned to wear fear like a fashionable bracelet and then had to get it cut off in a back room with a snip that hurt anyway. This version of her had gotten a different story, one with wind and a welding mask and a beagle who barked when the world had the audacity to do something interesting near his parking spot.

The next day, June said they were going to try the thing Irene had called ugly-fast. It meant catching a yaw with intentional overcorrection before overcorrection became a cartoon. It meant letting the body’s own flinch be the first part of the math and not the enemy. It meant if a part she thought she loved failed, she would let it fail loudly and replace it with something plainer and better. Lark didn’t have anything to hold during that. She didn’t have a flashlight or a donut or a boy to distract by asking him to carry cones. Her job was to stand at the edge of the shade and say “yes” with her face to all the eyes that would look up when the thing made a sound that made the town remember how anything new demands an organ. She thought of the indie film and the soup and the knives and the delicate trick of pretending to cut and not cutting, because of continuity. She thought of a sentence her mother had written in a book and how she had gotten to test the knob, not as a girl in heels at a party but as a woman in sneakers at a driveway.

The first ugly-fast scare was small, because fate is sometimes tender when it wants to train you. A cough became a hiccup became a tilt and then Sita breathed once and cut power and the object came down like a cat rolling off a couch with dignity intact. The second was less polite, rattling a bracket loose with a zing that made Eli grin like the universe had just sent him a lesson in how music is made of mistakes. June tightened the bracket and then shook her head and took it off and put on something thicker and made a note to write a thank you card to the friend who had given her the thinner bracket because gifts have their place but not all places need gifts. The third grew in grace out of stubbornness, ugly and then pretty and then genuinely itself, a balanced demand that the wind meet it halfway. Lark felt inside her chest the smallest of the sparrows that used to slam themselves against glass go, suddenly, a less frantic route to a windowsill.

Afternoon brought a quiet between weather fronts, and in that quiet Denise texted a photograph, the kind agents send when they want to use the visual to get you to answer the phone. It was a shot of a billboard mocked up with two silhouettes, a rocket and a woman in a welding helmet, and across it the words THE CORWIN EFFECT in a font that tried to look expensive. Lark called before Denise could ring, the kind of preemptive strike she’d learned from years of being managed lovingly. “No,” she said, which she tried to cushion with breath. “No to that name, no to that possessive. It’s not mine to be named after. No to the thing where the woman gets credit for being brave when what she’s been is stubborn and correct. If anything gets named, the town gets a plaque, and the plaque says this street put up with this. This driveway did this. This wind was here and didn’t blow us down.”

“Good,” Denise said, sounding not at all bruised and a little delighted, because people think agents like to win more than they like to be aligned with rightness and sometimes that isn’t true. “I had that made to see if you would spit it back at me. You did. Tomorrow wear the shirt with the tiny scorch mark you like and the boots that make you look like you build the things you talk about. Tell Fallon a story where even he has to be quiet for a second. I’ll keep the rest safely off your day.”

Evening brought the pond back into their periphery because Westfield doesn’t know how to be itself if you don’t take its water into account. They walked there again the way you walk a word to make sure it fits in your mouth, and this time, because the world is sometimes kind in exactly the small way you require, there were no ducks close to the path. There were only soft rings of insects on the surface of the water, and a girl in a yellow dress with mud on her ankles showing her mother how Minnows Do This, and a teenage boy lying on his back on the grass with his eyes closed, using the earth on purpose. June watched the sky the way you look at someone who is going to leave you and you love them anyway. Lark watched June watch the sky and holy things, which is how adoration gets to be useful when you don’t climb it up onto an altar and make it formal.

On the night of Fallon they did something that felt like it shouldn’t matter and therefore mattered. They ate scrambled eggs at five in the afternoon. They used the thick bread and the sort of ketchup that pretends to be grown-up by having less sugar. They were quiet in the kind of way that doesn’t come from fear but from not wanting to break the good dishes inside the hour. Irene put on lipstick and then wiped it off, applied chapstick like armor, and told Eli that if he made one face at the camera behind the camera she would assign him to coil hose for a week. Tamara kissed everyone without counting so as not to miss.

The satellite truck the network sent parked two houses down because their wheels were rude to curbs. A young person with headphones and grace set up a camera so the library and the not-yet-sculpture would both fit. The producer, who had been told about Irene and bats and consequences, shook hands like the handshake was a lease. Fallon’s face appeared in a rectangle on a stand in front of them, a thin man in a suit who had been blessed with sincere eyes and a makeup artist who knew about laughing lines. He did a warmup for them the way you do when you are about to talk a group into doing something and want them to like you for it. He asked if they liked Westfield and said he’d once bought a couch from their mall and was it still a mall or had the malls become hospitals yet. June said, “We like our mall like we like our dentists: we pretend to dread and then we thank it and go back every six months,” and Lark could see the exact moment a person on a late-night show realized they were going to get a different kind of segment than the one they had slotted.

The questions were what they were, softened by an intern who had been given a list of what not to say and had taken it seriously. There was a joke about ducks that Lark met with a smile and a one-sentence sermon about brains and seatbelts and how we don’t have to be brave in the way that looks good to strangers. There was real time for June to say out loud, on a big long string of pixels that would hit televisions and phones like rain, that she wanted to build a series of doors the town could brag about letting people walk through. Fallon did the move with his eyebrows he does when he hears a sentence he can add to his own private collection of reasons to be proud of his species. He ended by asking what they would name the rocket and June answered before anyone could turn it into a vote. “I’m not naming the rocket,” she said. “It’s not a pet. It’s a verb.”

They signed off and the town clapped at a TV they could have thrown a tennis ball at if they wanted. Denise texted twenty heart emojis and a spreadsheet screenshot because balance is everything. Irene exhaled like she’d been holding three forms open in her mind for the length of a pop song. Pax borrowed the headphones from the young person and listened to the station chatter like a man at church listening to an organ warm up. Ron brought over his beagle and said, “He liked it. He’s a critic and he liked it,” which was the kind of benediction that didn’t need religion to work. Lark went outside to the driveway and stood on the scorch mark and didn’t make a wish because that would have made it smaller. She just stood there and let the day pat her down for contraband and find none.

When the house finally went quiet, the wind had given up on itself for the day and left the trees to practice stillness. Lark found June in the garage, cleaning the same small area with a rag the way you do when cleaning isn’t about clean. The pendant had carved its little weight into Lark’s collarbones in the way of familiarity. She touched it without theatrics and said, “You called it a verb,” as if she hadn’t heard the line and clapped like every other American in a soft chair.

“I don’t want something I can set on a mantel,” June said. “I want something that argues with sky and comes home for dinner.” She looked up and her eyes were so bright they were almost rude. “Tomorrow, wind again. Then the slow low hover, no lift, push into ugly, stay, breathe. If it keeps saying yes, then after that… I think we try the high fence. Pax says it’s a bad metaphor, but I want my body to know we can clear a line that looks like the edge of permission.”

Lark nodded, loving a new piece of vocabulary without asking where it would sit. She thought of all the fences she had not tried to clear and all the hedges she had walked around politely. She thought of ducks asleep in their one-eyed way, guarding their half-worlds. She thought of audiences invisible and visible, and which one she owed what on any given Thursday. “I’ll hold the light,” she said, because it had become their liturgy. “I’ll hold it until you say stop. Then I’ll put it down very gently so it doesn’t remember my hand.”

They turned the garage lights off together and the rocket’s silhouette stayed in the room anyway, because things you make insist on being present even when you don’t indulge them. In the dark June’s hand found Lark’s elbow for one second, the smallest of moorings, and Lark thought that maybe she could learn stars after all, not to own them or to keep them, but to call the going by something other than luck. She went to bed and didn’t count ducks. She counted breaths until the night untied itself from her carefulness and pulled her under like water does when it likes you back.Chapter 7

Morning arrived as if it had written itself a schedule. The sun hit the lemon tree first, then the garage door, then the rectangle on the kitchen floor that marked where someone should stand if they wanted to be bathed in something like approval. The house knew what was planned without being told. June’s lists had reproduced overnight: one pinned to the chalk wall, one tucked under a magnet shaped like a chili pepper on the fridge, one written on the back of a takeout menu in a hand that had grown narrower and more impatient as the ink ran low. Irene had texted at dawn to say the air would be cooperative until lunchtime and then would go sideways in fits, like a child who had decided naps were an insult, and that if they wanted to try “the high fence” they should do it while the wind was still pretending to be a citizen.

It turned out “the high fence” wasn’t a literal barrier so much as an agreement about height. June and Sita had rigged a line across the cul-de-sac at a cautious distance with pennants made from strips of an old caution tarp and the corners of the girls’ childhood sheets. The pennants did a small bright dance in the breeze like an old-fashioned celebration trying very hard to be modern. Pax had brought sawhorses because he believed in the morale value of staging. Eli dragged the sawhorses to flank the line like bouncers who had been given a clip-and-store lecture by Irene on what to allow and what to shame. The mayor had sent two city employees whose job title was listed on their shirts as “General Utility,” and both of them wore it the way a cape is worn when you don’t want to be accused of pretending to be a hero.

Lark made coffee and decided to make eggs again because the eggs had been good luck. She salted them with her fingers and wiped her hands on a towel that had survived three kitchens and one fire and refused to die. The pendant rested in its place, warming against her skin as she moved, and she thought of the way June had pressed the tiny green sliver under glass like a joke and a mercy. For a long time, fear had felt like a noisy guest who refused to leave. Now, it felt like a tenant with a lease. She didn’t like it, but she knew when it would pay its rent.

She walked to the garage and found June in “pre-check prayer,” which is what Tamara had started calling the way she moved around the machine touching, not quite touching, calling out the names of things like a mother counting heads. Sita had the torque wrench in both hands and a look on her face that said she had recently won an argument with herself and kept it. Irene sat on the stool near the whiteboard with her legs crossed and a clipboard balanced on her knee. She had drawn a small crown on the top of the page where the word “wind” had been written, a private joke she hadn’t checked with anyone else. “We go ugly fast only if pretty fails and only once,” she said without looking up. “Then we don’t get addicted to the drama of the save. The drama is seductive and will steal your wallet.”

“Understood,” June said, and then, because she knew herself and the way her hands liked to believe they could save anything, she said it again. “Understood.”

Ron appeared with the beagle and a ratchet strap like a man attending to both sides of his personality at once. The strap, he informed anyone who’d listen, had held a canoe on his nephew’s Subaru through three seasons and one incident with megawind up by the quarry; it could hold a panel respectful if it had to. He handed it over with an eye on the pennants and an expression that said he had already rehearsed two stories to tell at the diner later: one in which nothing happened and he was gracious, one in which everything happened and he was also gracious. The beagle sniffed the chalk like it had a long-ago secret with calcium.

Denise had promised not to send anyone with a lens without warning, and she kept her promise. A lens arrived anyway, the kind that floats attached to four arms and a battery and a remote operator who stood in the shade of a maple as if shade were a legal argument. The drone tried to find a lane through the trees and the pennants as though it believed in the primacy of its mission, which was to gather light and sell it. Irene spotted it in the way you spot a wasp at a picnic—calm, immediate, already adjusting the food. She walked to the maple tree with the kind of authority that doesn’t need to be turned up and spoke to the operator without raising her voice. Lark watched from the driveway and saw the exact moment the operator recalibrated the shape of the trouble he was in and decided to land his machine like it had been his idea to do so.

When the cones went up, a small congregation formed of its own accord. Two teachers from the elementary school came on their planning period with coffees and the faces of women who have learned to love a well-run line. The librarian wore a denim shirt and joy. Pax’s cousin—who had a name that sounded like an old story, Abel—leaned against his truck and looked like he was practicing how to accept responsibility for more than his share of any future that required fixing. Tamara emerged, wiped clay from the heel of her hand onto her jeans in a way no one else could do without looking performative, and tucked a scrap of hair behind her ear that had been stubborn since Santa Fe. Lark’s father stood back with a towel over one shoulder like he’d forgotten he wasn’t in charge of a grill and would never be again.

“Okay,” June said, and the word held as much bravado as it could without spilling. “We clear the line or we don’t. No one gets a medal for altitude. We’re collecting proofs of control. Irene calls abort; Sita calls abort; I call abort, and any one of those is the spell that gives us cake later. If Ron calls abort I’ll pretend not to hear him unless he uses the voice he used on me when I was eight and decided to teach myself brakes on a dirt hill.”

Ron’s mouth twitched and he considered making the face, then decided to save it for when it would be needed.

The first lift was nothing dramatic, which is to say it was perfect. The thing hung just above the driveway and considered the pennants in the same way a cat considers a glass of water—interested, polite, vaguely threatening. June’s hands did their quiet choreography above the throttle and the yaw control, and Irene watched the windsock and counted under her breath like numbers could be taught to hum in key. The machine inched up as if guided by a string only June could see, and the line dipped to the right as a puff of afternoon from across the park decided to register its displeasure. Sita’s finger hovered, loving the possibility of a moment she wouldn’t have to make.

It cleared by inches that felt like narrative. The pennants did not catch. A strip of the old sheet flapped joyously and then settled as if it had not just measured the distance between permissibility and regret. The crowd did a small collective sigh because humans are incapable of saving their breath when a thing that needs it is in the room. June’s face didn’t move, but something in her shoulders closed a tab. Lark had the odd sensation of the pendant cooling and heating at once, as if the tiny green thing under glass were registering the air in the room and agreeing to behave.

Then the wind remembered what town it was in and performed a trick. It found a corner of the cul-de-sac where the warmth from the asphalt leaned up into the cool, which is a recipe for mischief. The machine drifted in the way a determined person drifts when questioned—only slightly, with annoyance. A garbage can down the block clacked its lid at the wrong time and a child coughed and a beagle decided to issue a single bark in the language of critique. The yaw went sideways quickly, ugly the way a clever person is ugly when they are tired and think they can fake it. Sita’s chin dipped; Irene’s eyes changed tempo; June let herself be the quick version of her careful and tapped a correction that was more like a flick than a push. The thing shuddered and shook out the anger and righted. Later, everyone who had been there would describe it differently and use their hands. In the moment, Lark registered it as a feeling you remember from a particular childhood fall: when your knee met gravel and you didn’t go down because your body found a way to say, not today.

They settled, did a checklist with the gravity of a prayer in a language nobody begrudges, and brought it down. People clapped in that way communities clap when they’ve agreed not to name what they’re praising because naming would make it smaller. Pax let out a yelp and then apologized to Irene for volume in a school zone; Irene said he could yell twice more as long as one of the yells was in metric. Ron exhaled like a tractor turning off. Eli’s hands vibrated in sympathy with the fans; Sita handed him a thing to hold that felt important so he would stop vibrating. Lark realized she was crying and let her face do it without the magazine version of the motion, because nobody had cameras but the kind you carry under your ribs.

They reset for a second try because no one knows how to quit when the day is this willing. During the setup, a woman who owned the hair salon on Main—the one that still had a photo of a 1998 prom cluster in the front window—sidled up to Lark and touched her elbow and said, “You made me laugh on the TV last night and then I cried because I thought about the way I used to hold my breath in church and I think I finally stopped. If you need the back room of the salon to keep your things that boys with papers want to photograph, tell me. I can put it next to the perm rods. They’ll never look there.” She smiled with a mouth that had fixed a thousand people for a thousand weddings and meant it.

The drone operator came back without the drone, hands in his pockets like he had learned to be on the side of humans. He apologized to Irene without sounding sorry he’d been caught, and asked if he could stand by the cones and just watch if he promised not to turn anything on. Irene gave him a look that could tune engines and then said, “You can stand by Pax. He will tell you about meters. If you say the phrase ‘content verticals’ near my cones I will give you a math test.” He stood by Pax and learned to nod on the beat.

The second lift was the one that tried to take their good will and turn it into hubris. June knew it as it happened, the way you recognize an old friend from far away and also recognize that their current mood will require you to stop them from making a speech. The machine rose and flirted with the line, then tipped its shoulder with a kind of swagger it had not been given permission to try. The correction that would serve pretty was past. Ugly-fast beckoned: the decisive, unlovely, extremely human move that says we mean to continue. June chose it before the invitation was fully written. She turned the control with a firmness that would have insulted someone who didn’t want to be told what to do and the machine obeyed in the way obedient things obey when they trust the voice that asks. The clearance was not handsome. It was effective. Pennants snapped into shape and then fell, chastened. The town cheered less loud this time because it had learned that sometimes the best applause is the sound you don’t make when the person you love is doing something delicate.

They brought it down and June sat, which she doesn’t do if she can help it. Tamara pressed a bottle of water into her hand and then touched the back of her head like checking for fever. Irene put a finger on the line of June’s wrist for a pulse and then pretended to be interested in a bolt so June wouldn’t be embarrassed by the intimacy. Lark sat on the curb because she needed to and the curb did what curbs do for people who have sat on them in many versions of their lives: it made a kind of sense.

That afternoon, while the tools cooled and the windsock made up its mind and the town found its chores again, the indie film called and asked for Lark at dusk on a porch with a screen door, the kind of porch that keeps secrets by creaking. Mara said the daylight had gone flimsier earlier than expected and they wanted to steal a scene while the sky knew how to keep its blue. Lark said yes to the stealing because it meant she could say no to something else later with the coin she’d earned, and because her days were now stitched out of choices that felt less like averting punishment and more like leaning toward usefulness. She drove there with June’s voice in her pocket saying things like “torque path” and “don’t let pretty fool you,” and she used those phrases on a paragraph that wanted to be too clean. The scene snapped into focus because she let herself say a line badly on purpose before she said it right, and Mara’s face did the grateful thing it did when someone trusted her enough to risk being seen with their mask half down.

When she returned, the house smelled like oranges and something that could have been sorrow if you weren’t careful. Her father had fallen asleep in the chair in the back room, his head tipped, the towel still on his shoulder like a friend. The radio hummed in the background with a public voice discussing drought plans in a tone like a bedtime story. There was a short list on the end table written in his hand—eggs, mulch, call dentist—that had a blank space in the middle where something had been meant to go. Lark stared at the blank and felt the cold reach that certain omissions perform. She put her finger in the space and said the names of things that might fit in a voice that could be mistaken for reading out loud to herself: batteries, beans, June. He woke without alarm, smiled, and said, as if picking up a conversation they had always had, “I always forget batter, not eggs,” and she let it slide because mercy sometimes means keeping a full back pocket of illusions within arm’s reach.

Later, over bowls of something Tamara called stew and June called fuel, Irene told a story in the low, matter-of-fact voice she only used when she wanted to offer herself up as a reason and not a standard. In Mojave there had been a day when wind had gone from idea to person, and a friend had tried to show it what kind of person he was. He had not been stupid, he had been sincere. He had carried calculation in his mouth and faith in his flinch and he had lost anyway, not his life, not that story, but a capacity for arrogance that he had not believed he possessed. “He is gentler now,” she said, which is a sentence that includes an elegy the way a stream includes the idea of rocks. “He builds less tall and more wide, and he lets the second idea be a long time coming. We are not those people and I am not asking us to be them. I am asking us to tell the truth to our own trouble before someone else’s trouble hears us lying and tries to teach us a lesson.”

June listened the way she listens to forms—pen ready, eyes kind. “Tomorrow no height,” she said. “We do discipline school. We do ugly on a leash until ugly stops pretending it knows better than me. We do torque again with a friend looking over my shoulder so I don’t become one of those cautionary fonts on a flyer.”

The docuseries producer sent an email with softened edges and the phrase “we want to honor your boundaries.” Denise replied with a paragraph that was polite and covered in tiny blades and included three non-negotiables and a line about tune-in times that used the word “adjacency” like a loaded pistol. It would be ridiculous if it weren’t also an act of protection. Lark forwarded the email to June who wrote back, a minute later, “I wish your work didn’t have to be this. I am grateful that your work is this.” Lark stared at the sentence for longer than the screen needed and then turned her phone over and let it be a face-down insect on the table.

The town’s high school invited June and Lark to speak in the auditorium that had hosted too many assemblies about vaping and not enough about propulsion. The principal wrote an email that sounded like an apology for the fluorescent lights and the way kids now are always tired and asking for accommodations like joy. They went, because saying yes to the kids is the only yes that should outrank safety and sleep. In the auditorium, the microphone made its small betrayal squeal and the teenagers made their larger, more merciful one, which is to be more generous than anyone expects as long as you don’t tell them they’re being generous. June brought a bolt and a bracket and held them up and said, “This holds because these threads agree to hold and because I don’t lie to them about their job,” and three kids in the third row sat forward like they had heard their own names. Lark told the knife-and-soup story because it had become the true thing she could tell without folding in on herself, and at the end a girl with the beginnings of a mustache and the ending of her patience raised her hand and said, “So you were afraid of ducks, like for real, and you didn’t fix it but you did something else,” and when Lark said yes, there was an audible feeling in the room, not quite a sigh, not quite a laugh. It sounded like permission granted without a ceremony.

On their way out, a boy with two different sneakers and a shy phone asked to take a picture. He held the phone up as if to trap them and then lowered it slowly instead. “I want to remember you with my eyes,” he said, mortified by his own sincerity, and then he ran away. Irene, who had come along to count fire exits and columns, laughed as if a bee had politely refused to sting her and said, “Town is making itself a very weird church.”

The weather rolled a bruise across the sky one morning and the texts started: are you doing it anyway, did you see the radar, is this a sign, should I bring my aunt who loves storms. June sent back a small, clean no and then a longer explanation about electricity and luck and how the cost of a day can be measured in two currencies and how she refused to go broke in either. Ron wrote “good call” under her post on the WESTFIELD REAL TALK group and three men with the word “real” in their profile names argued about whether caution was a plot. Pax posted a photograph of the windsock lying reproachfully on the grass like an exhausted fish with the caption, “tomorrow,” and people clicked little hearts because hope is the internet’s only real use.

On a day when the sky decided to be hospitable and June’s list had been satisfied with three checkmarks and a small offering of sweat, the high fence became the low fence and then no fence at all. They took the pennants down, because sometimes the presence of the obstacle makes you hit the obstacle on principle. June announced that she had a new favorite thing to say: “weight growth budget,” which meant she was allowed to add a pound of wiring and a handful of caution and still be within the promise she’d made herself when she decided she wouldn’t let the machine become a sculpture too soon. Lark thought about the phrase like an allegory she could try on her life and then put back on the hook for return later.

After dinner, Tamara invited everyone to the studio again because clay had become her weather. She unveiled the angry vase from Santa Fe and placed it on a table and then a taller, more complicated vessel she had made since, glazed in a color that could not decide whether it was pond or sky. “I told my class,” she said, wiping her hands on a towel that had known intimately the idea of grit, “that we make containers for what we can’t hold, and if we are lucky the thing we couldn’t hold finds a shape that looks like itself, and we discover we can hold it after all.” She put the vase and the vessel side by side, let them look at one another the way siblings look when the adults leave the room, and then slipped her arm through both of the girls’ unwilling elbows and held on.

Late that week, the production company with the tasteful access wrote back agreeing, unbelievably, to every demand with four caveats that Denise sent back capped with four no’s and two alternate suggestions and a budget revision that somehow made numbers feel like a language for covenants instead of tricks. Irene had the last word, which was not like her, and the word was “pilot only,” because she did not believe in seasons in life or television until she had evidence for them. June drew a small box on the chalkboard and wrote inside it: only if we still get to say stop. Pax brought over an old red light from a theater junk sale and mounted it on a post near the garage door. If they flicked it on, it meant the crew, any crew, was a no. If it wasn’t lit, it still could be a no. “Sometimes I like you best when you are predictable about being complicated,” Lark told her sister, who bowed then, ironically, to the red light like it had asked for her autograph.

That Saturday, the town woke ready to spend its attention. The farmers market put out early strawberries that tasted like effort. The cafe set up a table outside with a sign that said “Rocket Fuel” in chalk and then in parentheses “coffee, we mean coffee.” A band with a banjo practiced two doors down and then practiced again with less banjo. The high fence day without fence had settled into their bones as a story they could tell in either direction—“remember when we almost” and “remember when we did.” Lark walked past the pond with Tamara who had decided to count the turtles like a researcher one might pay if one were interested in the daily complicities of suburban wildlife. A small boy stood on the low bridge with a slice of bread his mother had given him because she had not read the sign, and Lark, trying not to make anything more dramatic than it needed to be, stood with them and used her movie voice, the soft one that makes people lean in, to say, “You see how they’re pretending to be hungry for bread but really they need bugs and green stuff and things that wiggle. They’ll take that bread and say thank you and then their bodies will be confused and sad. It’s a weird trick we learned to play on them. What if we tricked them in the other direction and threw peas?” The mother looked at the sign and then at Lark and made a face like she’d been caught but was grateful. The boy whispered “peas” as if it were a secret password. Tamara said, “I have peas,” because of course she did, and the three of them stood there flicking green coins and being thanked by a rush of water and small beaks. When they walked away, a teenage couple took their place, and the girl said, “You know who that was,” and the boy said, “Someone nice,” and for once that was the answer.

In the late light of Sunday, June brought the machine out for what she insisted was not a test and Irene called “a behavioral exercise” and Pax called “church,” which the mayor tried once to second and then withdrew because she did not want to irritate constituents. They practiced hovering low until Irene could look away for a full three breaths without thinking she would be punished by a coincidence. They mapped the effect of a bicycle passing at speed two streets over because there is no such thing as too much superstition that can be measured. Eli asked if he could hold the anemometer without the broom and Irene let him, watching him watch numbers become wind, which is a small sort of alchemy you want young people to believe in before anyone tells them it isn’t real.

Just as they were putting it away, a car from a paper two counties over pulled up and a woman in a linen jacket with proper shoes stepped out with a notebook like a minority religion. She asked if she could ask three questions and then asked two very good ones and one that made Lark want to laugh. “What do you want it to feel like when you leave the ground,” the woman asked June, and June considered the floor as if thinking happened there and then answered, “I want it to feel like the first time you say a word you’ve only ever read.” The woman nodded like she had come for that sentence and got in her car and left, taking it away to put on a page where strangers could read it and feel less alone without knowing why.

That night, the ducks were neither villains nor symbols, just small green heads under a satin black that had sewn itself over the pond. Lark lay in her bed and listened to the compressor in the fridge do its little complaint, to the far train rehearse its loneliest syllable, to the wind in the maple tell a story in a dialect it had picked up out west and brought home. She thought of the fence and the line and the way permission can be a set of pennants you put up yourself and then have the audacity to clear anyway. She touched the glass dome on the pendant with the skitter of her fingernail and felt the duck decoy heart and the rocket skin steady under it, private and offered at once. She promised herself, without ceremony and without witnesses, that she would keep repositioning her fear toward useful norths and would hold the light until her arms trembled and then hand it carefully to Eli or Irene or the boy with the eyebrows or anyone whose fingers hadn’t yet gotten their chance to ache from holding. In the morning, June would wake up with a solution to a problem that had not introduced itself and would treat it like an expected guest. In the morning, Denise would send a text with a calendar and a joke. In the morning, the town would open its eyes and ask, as all towns do, for something to point at with pride. For now, night took its job back and did not fail them.

The next week wrote itself future and then asked them to fill it in. Monday brought a man in a suit that fit him like an argument, who wanted to invest in June’s verb because his fund had a hole in the shape of modern hope. He spoke kindly and too fast and watched June’s hands as if her fingers made money by virtue of moving. June gave him water in a mason jar and used words like “no” and “later” and “we” in a way that made the jar sweat. Lark sat in the doorway and learned the grammar of defense that has no trace of bitterness in it, only line-drawing. Tuesday brought a thirty-minute segment on the local radio with Pax where callers asked if the rocket could be used for charcuterie delivery (no), for emergency hearts (maybe someday), for mail (stop). Wednesday brought an email from the state that had a kind tone and the word “permit” spelled correctly throughout, which made Irene clap exactly once. Thursday brought nothing but weather and work and the relief of a day no one wanted to write a sentence about later.

On Friday, they tried ugly-fast on uneven ground because Irene had written the sentence “life is not the driveway” on the board and underlined it like a threat and a wish. They rolled to the park’s edge where the grass made a poor case for itself and the ground undulated as if it had inherited some opinion from the creek. The windsock took up a position like a judge. Sita rigged the new, heavier bracket and tapped it with her wrench like she was listening to a sleeping thing’s chest. Eli marked out a perimeter that seemed too large until the wind bunched itself and decided to make a point. Kids from the elementary school hung on the fence, small faces made of breath and summer and opinions. Irene explained, loudly enough for all of them to pretend not to hear, what a soft abort looks like and what men in old movies got wrong about the difference between daring and flirting with hospitals. June adjusted her stance in a way that made Lark think of a girl at the top of a diving board who taught herself to let her heels kiss the wood hello before she jumped.

The machine did what it does when it is watched by children. It behaved nearly perfectly and then failed in a small, teachable way. A gust did a mean thing and then pretended innocence. The correction June chose was decent and would have been enough at home. The grass under the right front foot turned out to be damp from a sprinkler that somebody had forgotten to turn off, and damp grass made a liar of friction. The strange beauty of it was how the failure drew every person present into a single body for a beat. Sita’s hand moved. Irene’s voice said, “now.” June’s jaw set. Eli took a step forward like an offering and then back like a good boy. Lark felt her fear try to stand on the chair, and she told it to sit down. The machine kissed the ground where it should not, and a panel skittered with a sound like someone pushing a baking sheet across tile. A boy whispered “cool,” reverent and bad, and his mother put a hand on his head without looking at him because she had learned gentleness was the leash that made some forms of awe behave.

Nothing exploded. Nothing smoldered. The bracket did not embarrass itself. The failure was the kind you can hold in your hands and assign homework to. June crouched, forehead briefly to the machine’s side as if listening for a heartbeat, then looked up and said, “I owe you all a better philosophy of grass,” and the kids inched closer because she had said the kind of sentence that turns into a pull quote on posters in rooms where adults hope children will feel something they are not yet cynical about.

That evening, the pond had a kind of light on it that made everyone speak in sentences that included the words “remember” and “always” and were not entirely accurate but nobody cared. A pair of geese did a sloppy parade with babies who were impossible to hate, and a turtle made a case for the superiority of turtles by doing nothing and still being applauded by a toddler. Lark and June walked the path slow, not because of fear but because speed had become a tool, something not to be spent casually. Behind them, the town tried on a future where the library lawn had a sculpture that could, at certain times, be a door. In front of them, a boy on a bike practiced riding no-hands and then caught himself with a laugh that suggested he’d decided the ground was a friend. Above them, a big lazy V of birds made a letter across the early dark. Lark looked up and thought, with a sudden consistent joy, that she might finally do what she’d promised herself on a night near sleep—that she might learn the names, not to own them but to hold the going in her mouth, to taste the truth of it. She would start with Vega and Altair, teach herself that the Swan was a story and not a dare, steel herself against the unfortunate name of the star in the tail that she would refuse to say in front of Tamara without a warning. She would join Irene under a certain winter sky and be taught what edges mean at different times of year. She would hold the light, and when her arms tired, she would say so. She would stop when stop was holy, and she would go when go was a verb that made all the right noise.

The next morning would be letters with agreements and a grocery run where a stranger would buy her strawberries because her niece had squealed when the rocket cleared the line and that squeal had reached his old heart and done a neat repair. It would be a phone call with Denise about a shoot in a field that would be actually a field with ticks and they would say no to the ticks and yes to the field on a different day. It would be Jo from the salon putting a note on her mirror that said NO DIFFUSERS ON LAUNCH DAYS because the noise spooked the ancient dog under the desk. It would be Tamara glazing something with stars and pretending it was an accident. It would be the high fence taken down and the marks on the driveway beginning to look like a map you could learn, not to travel exactly, but to point at when someone younger asked you how to get there.

They would go to the state and get a sternness and a permission. They would make a thing that rose, then stayed, then came down. They would set plates and wash them. They would read the notes from the internet and not die. They would walk to the pond and see what it offered. They would not invite miracles and they would accept them anyway, in the form of bolts that chose to stay home and wind that chose to be polite and ducks that chose that day to be more rock than bird. They would remember how to be a person in a room while a machine warms the air. They would be sisters in the first and truest sense: two people who throw their attention toward the same corner every morning and find a way, with hands and vowels, to keep it steady.Chapter 10

The docuseries pilot arrived on a Wednesday that had the nerve to be ordinary. The crew came in a white van that smelled faintly of yogurt and ambition, and they carried cases that made the neighbors look up the way they used to when someone rolled a piano into a parlor. Denise had written a little manifesto the week before—three pages, short paragraphs, no exclamation points—and the producer read it like a person learning the rules to a game he did not believe would be fun. The red light Pax had mounted near the garage door glowed until Irene nodded twice, and when it clicked off the room felt taller, as if permission added headroom. “We keep the wires out of the pond,” June said by way of welcome, and the sound guy did a small defensive shrug like he had interfered with water before and had learned nothing useful.

Lark knew how to do this part so well it made her teeth ache. She stood where they asked and then stood where she asked and kept her voice in the register that turns strangers into participants. The camera wanted her face to break at certain times, and she disappointed it by breaking her face at others. The producer tried to write a scene in which a duck, adorable and problematic, would glide through the frame at the exact moment June used the word thrust, and Irene intercepted the outline with a smile that had the weight of road salt. “We don’t bait wildlife,” she said without raising anything but the temperature of the silence, and the producer made a little motion with his hand as if swatting a thought. They filmed anyway, without the duck, and it turned out to be a better scene: June naming bolts like saints, Sita laughing with her whole collarbone, Pax demonstrating with two donuts how yaw can pretend to be your friend.

The week organized itself around a bright circle on the calendar called HOP 6 in Irene’s careful print. It would be the first one with a temporary flight restriction over Westfield, a phrase that made old men at the diner sit up straighter and count planes out the window just to feel useful. Irene handled the paperwork like a person carrying a cake through a kitchen where children have been invited to participate; she kept one elbow high and the other low and never moved faster than a brisk kindness. The mayor learned how to say NOTAM without turning it into a joke, which is harder than it sounds. Pax ran comms to the hobby airport fifteen miles away where men in foam-capped hangars called their wives to say, “You will not believe what America is doing in a cul-de-sac.”

June finished Block B with a tenderness that scared her a little. The heavier bracket had been given a ceremony consisting of a torque wrench, two witnesses, and a joke about dowries. She had added three sensors that would tell her what the belly felt when ugliness visited and had run wires so clean and labeled so politely that Irene took a photograph for her secret album of competence. There was a new vent that June described as “a door for hot spirits,” which made the librarian blush and the high schoolers draw ghosts on the chalkboard. Sita found a hairline crack in a fitting and refused to let it be a metaphor; she replaced it, put the cracked one on a shelf like a lesson, and told June that they were not building an altar.

Lark’s film answered the festival question with a yes that had garnish. The program would premiere at dusk under an awning made of college money in a town that thought it had invented independent thought, and the director texted a photo of paper lanterns like captured moons. Denise already had a dress delivered, something that understood shoulders, and a little case of pins for hair that would make her look like she had been blessed by a careful wind. The problem was not the dress; the problem was that HOP 6 had the same hunger for that dusk. June said she could move the hop an hour earlier and Lark said she could drive fast and Mara said she could hold the monologue until the last possible breath, and Irene said, in the way of a woman who has been assigned to save people from themselves, “Pick the one you will not resent.” Lark told the dress to wait, told the pins to forgive her, and told the lanterns she would visit them in a different life.

The day before HOP 6, Tamara’s angry vase cracked with a sound that had been promised to clay and not to the people in the kitchen. She had set it near the sink because even artists forget themselves, and the faucet did that overreach it had been doing for a month, the one that Lark’s father kept promising to fix. The crack was thin and clever and, as Tamara held the vase in both hands and breathed out slow, it traveled like an idea that wants to be caught saying it deserves to exist. “It was always going to do that,” she said, not angry at all now, and put her thumb along the new line as if it were a seam in a dress she meant to be taken in. “I can make it purposeful if I want. I can fill the fault with gold and then charge sad strangers for feeling seen.” June kissed the ridge of her knuckle in an absent-minded way and then made a note in her head about pressure and the way you cannot ask water, fire, or attention to be less themselves.

Her father wandered that night, not far and not dangerously, but he opened the back door and went out without his shoes and walked until the grass asked his soft feet to consider memory as a different country. Lark found him by the lemon tree, standing with his hands open as if rain had been promised. He wore the towel over his shoulder and had a spoon in his hand for no reason the world could discern. She got him back inside by asking him if the bees would like to sleep in the kitchen tonight, which he thought was funny in a way that rearranged him into the man he had been last year, and they stood for a minute with their foreheads leaned against the cool of the refrigerator. He said, “You were a good baby. You slept with your fists like you were guarding jokes,” and she didn’t tell him she had never slept that way because she didn’t want to lose the picture he had drawn.

HOP 6 morning was one of those midwestern compromises: the air promised civility and the wind promised nothing beyond appearing occasionally and keeping things from becoming too easy. Irene had real firefighters on hand this time, not because she didn’t trust Pax’s hoses or Ron’s beagle to sense hubris, but because she believed in telling luck she’d done what she could. The TFR went live five minutes before they rolled the machine out of the garage, and somewhere a man in a small plane peered at his panel and felt important for obeying a rule you could explain to a twelve-year-old. The docuseries crew, chastened by the red light’s earlier theology, kept their distance and filmed feet and hands and the back of Irene’s head because something in them had learned, briefly, how to love the edges of action.

A surprise presented itself in the sensible way surprises do around towns with ponds. Migration had ignored the calendar by a day. A line of geese like a lazy necklace had draped itself along the far end of the cul-de-sac, heads down in a way that meant both food and disinterest. They were not on the field of play; they were not even interested in the cones; they simply existed at the exact intersection of intention and liability. Irene pulled her lower lip into her mouth and chewed a principle. Pax muttered to the windsock as if it could endorse a delay. June looked at the line of gray and green and made her face do nothing. Lark walked to the mayor’s office in her rib cage and convened something that did not involve votes or donuts.

They postponed and the town absorbed it like a harmless winter. Boys on bikes made loops with extra gravity so their feelings would not fly out. The mayor apologized to a retired man who needed to be apologized to in order to tell a good story later, and he nodded and was gracious both in the telling and the being. The salon owner showed up with peas in a bag that had once been full of Sinatra records and handed them out like communion. Mothers showed their sons how to toss them not like stones but like small gifts; fathers, grudging and tender, followed suit. The geese accepted and shuffled and then, resigned to the rude generosity of it, chose another corner of their day. Ron stood with his hands in his pockets and made himself not say what he could have said about birds and men and respect.

The hop itself carried a new kind of quiet. The town had already spent its first sigh; no one wanted to give the second away. June cycled through checklists in a tone she used for bedtime stories when her goddaughter visited, and Sita’s finger floated like a promise she wanted to keep. The machine rose, and for once it did so without ceremony—a sensible lever drawn, a reasonable answer returned. It cleared the invisible fence Irene had drawn with geometry and pencils, and held. Under the belly, air remembered how to agree with itself faster. The yaw twitch came, then passed, and June didn’t let her pride reach for it like a bad snack.

Halfway through, failure entered its name on the register with a polite cough. A minor oscillation on a vector June had believed she had charmed made the right-paneled world flicker. Sita said “now” in a voice that held both fear and habit, and June flicked the ugly-fast she had trained for without letting it become a sermon. The vent did what a door does for breath when a room is crowded. Heat that would have pretended anger simply left and made new friends upward. The machine settled with a certainty it had not yet owned, and the pennants that had been rolled and hidden in a bin rustled as if remembering old work.

There was a small fire, because complexities insist on finishing their thought. It happened two feet to the left of any human foot and on a scrap of grass already resigned to its own existence. Pax was halfway there before Irene would have had to say a thing, and the hiss of foam made everyone think of holidays in other countries. A child said “cool” again in the precise tone of a person in training for awe, and his mother chose to let him be right without telling him what could have been. June sat on the ground the way you sit when you intend for the ground to forgive you, not because you did anything unforgivable, but because you believe in good relations.

Applause happened, but it wasn’t loud. It moved through the group like a hand over a blanket, smoothing. People nodded as if they had come to the end of a particularly satisfying sentence and were afraid to ruin the cadence with what came next. The docuseries camera caught two seconds of true happiness on June’s mouth and then lost it because true happiness isn’t trained to hit its mark. Lark went to her, not to lift her up or to be lifted, but to be at the exact place where relief looks out over the next field. They didn’t say anything good enough for quotable, which is what made it perfect.

The email from the festival sat like an egg until dusk, and then it cracked in Lark’s pocket. Mara sent a picture of a paper lantern that did not need her face; it needed strangers and it had found them. Denise texted a photo of the dress hanging from the top of a door and said, “I know, don’t worry, we will give it a different night,” and for once she meant it without experienced sarcasm. Lark stood on the scorch mark and let the pendant learn her heartbeat again. The green sliver under glass caught the last yellow in the trees and became briefly the kind of hope you can carry without resenting its weight.

That night the house tasted like oranges and hose water and the power of not being filmed. Tamara taped the crack in the vase in an X not because it would help but because human hands like to do something visible when they are agreeing in private. Irene opened her laptop and wrote a letter to a person at a desk with a title, and the sentences arranged themselves in the tone of a favor owed and a favor paid. Sita fell asleep on the couch like a soldier in peacetime, and Eli wrote “ugly-fast” in the margins of his math worksheet and knew, because he had been given permission by adults who know better, that he would get away with it.

Trouble came in a smaller costume the next morning and knocked, polite and irritating. The docuseries producer wanted a pickup shot in which Lark looked at the pond from a distance and thought something, anything, that would cut well with a voice-over he had already recorded about fear being a horizon. Denise had not protected against pickup shots because you cannot protect against everything, and Irene was at the county offices trying to keep a form from learning to duplicate itself in a drawer. June said she could be the one to look and think, and the producer laughed in that way that tries to make insult a social event. Lark told him no so quickly and so kindly that he forgot what he had been about to say about sunlight.

She went to the pond anyway, as one goes to see a person after telling someone else they do not get to see that person. Westfield gave her the usuals: a jogger with a backpack full of reasons, a woman practicing tai chi with the sort of sincerity that erases embarrassment from the air, a fathers-and-strollers alliance that made everyone’s genes feel seen. She stood by the sign about bread and watched a line of mallards write a sentence on the water no one could translate. The fear touched her shoulder and then did that thing where it went to sit down without drama, and she reached up and touched the glass dome the way a person touches a proof they don’t need to show anyone else to believe.

On the way back, she saw Ron in his driveway teaching his beagle to sit on command and the beagle teaching him what command meant under certain philosophies. He waved her over without the clipboard like a man who had taken a chance on someone else’s verbs and found it tasted better than he had expected. He showed her his wheel well where the dent from wind school now had a scar like a smile that had decided to stick around. He said, “I told my nephew this week he doesn’t get to call himself a man just because he has opinions and access to a truck. He has to build something or keep quiet while somebody else does. He will probably go on the internet and call me names. I will tell him to come over and I’ll feed him pie.” Lark told him she believed in his plan like it was physics.

The hearing at the state capitol came and went with fewer theatrics than the town had expected and more difficulty than June had hoped. The panel wanted to know about birds again because birds are a convenient method for people to name their vague wholesomeness. Irene brought charts and a photograph of the windsock looking saintly and explained that the birds were not the stakeholders the state imagined them to be, at least in this case, in this place, at these times, with these protections. June spoke about flame trenches as if she were discussing manners at a table set for cousins, and a man with a chin tried to trap her in a sentence about ambition and she changed the tense on him before he could finish. Lark watched a woman in the second row whose job title did not fit on the placard, and when that woman leaned forward, Lark leaned forward, and the signal went back and forth between two people who had no intention of being photographed that day.

They returned to banners on Main Street not for them but for a chili cook-off that had been scheduled for the same Saturday because towns are always doing too much in the same place and pretending they meant to. Pax entered with a recipe called Throttle and the mayor’s husband burned his onions and swore in the church parking lot. Denise came wearing sneakers and no makeup and bought three jars of jam from a woman who had never been to Los Angeles and had decided she did not like it anyway. Tamara’s studio opened its door, and she hung the cracked vase with gold like a confession on the north wall where the light made it less about an apology and more about a map.

That evening there was a meteor shower that had not consulted Westfield before scheduling itself. Irene dragged a telescope from her trunk like a magician learning to carry her own hat, and she showed the kids Vega and Deneb and the long arm of the Andromeda as if she were introducing them to cousins who would always pick them up at the airport. Lark lay on the driveway with a cushion and a blanket that had once been an animal and learned to pick out the Swan and refuse, privately, to call its tail by the name she disliked. June lay beside her without speaking because sometimes gratitude ruins itself when narrated. A meteor scratched a brilliant mistake across the roof of their night and nobody made a wish because wishes are lazy and they’d done the paperwork.

Sometime after midnight, after the last teenager had been persuaded by an aunt to go home and the last jar of chili pride had been absorbed back into the body of Westfield, an email came in from a woman who signed nothing and owned nothing but her voice. She wrote that she had watched the segment on television with an old cat in her lap, and that she had changed the lightbulb on her porch last week while crying, and that she had been waiting to read a story in which a woman chose to stay in a town instead of leaving it for a prize and did not get punished by fate or patriarchy. She wrote that ducks are stupid and sweet and that she used to count sparrows between the minutes of her husband’s breathing. She ended by saying, “I have been taught that fear is a kind of rudeness I should correct with better manners, and it is such a relief to be told it is a coordinate.” Lark closed her eyes after she read it, not to sleep, but because sometimes the body wants to agree in darkness.

The next morning the rocket wanted something small and obnoxious and refused to be elegant about asking. June scowled at a junction that had once behaved and decided to misbehave, and she tapped it with a wrench that had known her hand long enough to be a friend. Sita handed her a different size of the same and then a different material entirely because this is how love behaves among people who build things: you keep offering alternatives until the stubbornness finds itself alone. Irene made tea and pretended to discuss air speed with Pax while listening for a sound only she can hear, the sound a day makes when it is deciding whether to be the kind that lends itself to a chapter or to a grocery list.

They did not lift that day because not lifting is a skill that needs exercise. Instead, June and Lark and Tamara and the father and Irene and Pax and Sita and Eli and the beagle went down to the pond for twenty minutes without changing their clothes to town clothes. They fed peas like they were paying a tithe to the gods of unremarkable comfort. The ducks came and pretended to deserve it and did not look at anyone particularly. A boy in a superhero t-shirt leaned against a railing too much and learned, gently, the difference between almost and sooner. Lark heard a train and said the syllable out loud because it has become a family joke that the train owes them rent, and June laughed and leaned her head on Lark’s shoulder in the kind of way that means the day is going to be fine.

In the afternoon, Westfield’s high school had a power outage and the principal texted to ask if the library could host two classes with good behavior and one with a track record like weather. The librarian said yes because that is the librarian’s religion, and Lark came to read out loud because it turns out fame is just a permission slip that lets you do the work you wanted to do when you were nine. She read them the story about the bus and the word OUT OF SERVICE and did not tell them it was her because sometimes the room is better off thinking it’s about anybody. When she finished, a boy asked if the rocket would go to Mars and June, who had come to fix a chair in the reading corner, said, “We’re going to Westfield,” and the boy made a face and then, after a second, did not.

By sunset, the docuseries producer had learned to bring seltzer and to sit on the steps and to keep his phrases in his mouth until they had matured. He asked June if he could mic the machine and June said yes in a way that made it clear microphones were not to be glued, dangled, or treated like solutions. He asked Lark if she’d say the sentence again about fear and seatbelts, and she said she would not because truth refuses repetition on certain days. He asked Irene for a quote about liability and she told him about a boy she’d known who learned to use his hands without hurting people, and he looked disappointed at the lack of an acronym. They filmed the beagle yawning and forgot to roll on the moment the windsock nodded like a friend you will lose.

HOP 7 landed on a Monday because fate likes to remind you you are mortal in the least poetic parts of the week. The wind was nothing, a rumor. The geese had moved. The paperwork smelled faintly of ink and triumph. June tied her hair back in the blunt braids that make engines feel calm. Sita checked the bracket, kissed her teeth, and pretended to threaten it with a hammer. Irene ran a fingertip along a seam that had once worried her and was now just part of the family. Lark stood at the edge with her mouth full of a speech she planned not to need.

It rose. It hovered. It sloped its shoulder toward a joke and then took the joke back. It bought the town one more story it could tell with the word “we.” The beagle did not bark; the boy did. The windsock made a convincing case for dignity. The machine came down, and June laughed from somewhere in her lungs that no one had touched since she was a teenager falling asleep on a trampoline under satellites we used to think were stars. The crew caught the laugh because luck owed them one. The town let itself clap with both hands and no pockets.

Afterward, when everyone was full of relief and committed to chili, June pulled Lark aside with a look that belonged to eleven-year-old June with a paper airplane that had gone too far and not far enough. “Next month Irene says we can try a long pause at top of arc, not long-long, but time enough for a person to know they have become a person with a different view,” she said, voice steady like a danger line written in chalk. “I am not asking you to come because of cameras or because the town needs to see your mouth behaving. I am asking you to come because I want you there when I teach my body a new yes.” Lark did not answer with a speech because a speech would only steal the electricity from the wire. She said, “I will hold the light,” and the little green sliver under glass seemed to thank them both for remembering what kind of story they had chosen.
