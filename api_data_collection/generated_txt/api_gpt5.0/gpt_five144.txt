The first ledger I ever loved was made of paper so thin it whispered. I kept it behind the boiled candy tin at my mother’s tea stall, and when no one was watching I pulled it out to run the pads of my fingers along the ruled lines like braille for futures. I didn’t know the names of the columns then. I didn’t know the names of much. Only this: that numbers were bone, and everything else would lean or fall by how true they held.

By the time the paper ledgers were dusted in museums and the city roofs had grown gardens to sponge the heat, I wore a badge that let me into the Ministry of Allotments before the sun. The badge had my name and a glinting chip that told the door I wouldn’t try to steal anything that mattered. They never thought to protect the doors from accountants. We’re too boring, too harmless, they say. It’s always the quiet ones, says my mother as if she invented irony.

They call my division Aggregates, because we stack lives into sums. The room we work in is long and thin like a slice of cake. Our desks are in a row against the windows that look down over the frost-blue canal and the morning men drifting past on their boats. The men always look left when the light turns green and right when the light turns red. The traffic makes no difference to boats, but there are rules, and men are good at obeying them. Better than we are, sometimes. Better than me, often.

Caffeine rings stippled every surface. There is a machine that grinds beans the way hail grinds leaves. There is a poster of a friendly whale wearing a tie that says Warning: Drowning In Data Can Be Fun. I hate the whale, but I also wave to it when no one is watching. That is the sort of morning it is. That is the sort of person I am, take it or leave it.

On my screen the Atlas ledger resolves itself into tiles. Atlas is the planetary book of everything we owe and everything owed to us, divided and subdivided until the tiniest transaction—one kiss, one loaf, one hour of sitting with a dying aunt—sits in its cell, coded to the last comma. I should say here, because it matters, because you won’t stop thinking it as you listen to me: yes, this is the world where men are rich. Rich in the literal sense. The Consensus Dividend pays them in perpetuity from the day their birth certificate is stamped. We all voted for it two hundred years ago after a war that snuffed entire cities and left the air clotted with ash for a decade. We paid men to lay their axes down. We promised security and we kept that promise, and each year the Fund pays out again, and each year the men drift through the mornings on their boats.

If you don’t like it, stand for Council, my mother tells me. She tells me to stand for many things.

Mona Braid, my director, slaps two sticky notes to the edge of my monitor as she moves down the line. It is her way of saying hello. The yellow note says Miss Kwon, the Omnibus Male Fund is trending a half-point over baseline—explain why. The pink note is a sketch of the friendly tie-wearing whale, harpooned.

Harmless, I write back. And because I can’t help myself: Whales are men too. I crumple the notes before she sees it. She does not like jokes that bend.

I drill down into the Omnibus. Off-world holdings hum along, steady as gravestones. On-world dividends hit the accounts at midnight and are already evaporating into soaps and soup kitchens and violin lessons for orphans who will never play a hall. Men spend a lot on lessons. They are earnest in this, and in many other things. When Atlas rolled out the Classifier, which assigned each living person an Index of Harmlessness, the men lit up like lanterns as if some old burden slid from their shoulders. It could have been a trick. I wanted it to be a trick. But the numbers held.

There is an anomaly. Not in the balances; it is subtler than that, as if someone has changed the context and left the entries alone. Atlas normally tags transactions with a Risk Color—green, amber, red, and black, the last reserved for those who buy guns or demons. But here in the Omnibus, a few lines—forty-seven, fifty, then three hundred and two—flare a color I’ve never seen. It is bright as damaged coral. It is called Gentle Red. I lean closer. Gentle Red is new.

“Cass,” says a voice behind me. “We looked in the mirror and it winked.”

Felix Gentle always sounds as if he is trying to place the phrase he is about to use, as if he has found it in a pocket with lint and a coin. He stands in the aisle, just behind my chair, because men rarely sit when they visit Ministries. They are guests by design. They never have to file forms. He is tall but there is nothing of the hawk about him. His shoulders are a stack of blankets. His suit is a sheet of sky he put on by mistake and did not notice. Sunlight loves him like a dog. It finds his eyes and licks them.

“Gentle Red?” He leans closer, too far, until his hair blurs the edge of my screen. His breath smells like mint tea and orange peel. I want to shove him and then immediately apologize. I do neither. “Now that’s a trick,” he says.

“It shouldn’t exist,” I say. “Risk tags are standardized. If the system creates a new one, Regulation wants to be asked first.”

“Gentle Red,” he says again. He taps the edge of the desk, an arrhythmic drumline. “Risk that wants to be hugged.”

His name is unfortunate. He insists it’s real. His mother loved Petrarch and lost a bet. I only half believe him. I could ask Atlas to send me his original registry file, but then I would know it, and then what? The file would live in me. I would never get it out. I am already full of things like that.

Mona passes again, hand hovering over my head, not touching, the way one does over bread one is tempted to tear. “It’s not on any of the scrubbed boards,” she says. “Go deeper, Cass. Go all the way down.”

Going all the way down does not mean breaking the rules. It means moving to the stairwell with the plant that has outgrown its pot, to a corner with a good angle on thirty-six monitors at once, and emptying the desk drawer with the hidden port. I plug in the cable and the cable hums and my hands hum, and there’s the other Atlas—the one with its polite voice turned off. The blocks turn over like turtles and show their undersides: time stamps, flags, auditors’ marks, a map of the fingers that touched each line.

Gentle Red appears in the Omnibus for the first time at 02:13, the dot of a pin. The tag propagates like a rumor. Only the Omnibus is touched. Only the payouts to men. Women’s funds, public works, the city’s sick, all shine their regular colors. Green is for groceries. Amber is for art and anything that might be confused with art. Red is for risk of harm: knives, accelerants, unlicensed fireworks, disinformation channels, the purchase of bite-dogs with metal teeth. Black is none of your business; black is secret and rare.

But this, this Gentle Red—if I hover, the tooltip says: risk of harm flagged; predicted harmless outcome.

“That’s a contradiction,” I say.

Felix brings both hands to his mouth as if praying. “How do you write harm on one line and harmless on the next? Is that poetry? Are we allowed to call this poetry?”

“Not in this office.” I rub my eyes. “It’s a prototype. It shouldn’t have deployed.”

Mona is on her phone, pacing and chewing, voice clipped as a clock. “—No one in Underwriting approved this—No, post a rollback plan—Downstage the class—Send me your eyes on it—No, you send yourself.” She catches me staring. “Don’t blink,” she mouths.

I don’t. I ride the lines with my cursor until my fingers ache. Gentle Red is sticky. It adheres to anything associated with the Omnibus: the man who sells Felix oranges and mint; the string of receipts from an afternoon purchase of wind chimes; the donation to an old school’s roof; the tip to a girl showing him how to fix a canoe. Felix spends a lot on wind chimes. I remember that from last month’s audit. He said something about sound and good ghosts.

“What if this is a gift?” Felix says. “A new way of seeing the same old picture. Our colors have always been blunt. Maybe someone decided to add nuance.”

“Nuance gets people killed,” Mona says without looking up.

Felix lowers his hands. “That’s a harsh sentence.”

“It’s the only one that keeps me employed.” Mona presses her phone to her chest. “Kwon, you and your shadow strip this thing to the bones.”

“You and your shadow,” he repeats, smiling. He’s the shadow. We don’t say it in the office because we don’t have to. Each auditor is paired, for their sanity and to keep the peace, with one of the men whose income line runs bright through our board. They stand behind us like gentle ghosts and we let them, because two hundred years of a bargain is not undone by rolling eyes.

If you are wondering whether I like my shadow, the answer is yes and no. I like his patience. I like his habit of bringing bags of small sweet fruits with the stems still attached. I do not like his habit of asking questions with the audacity of a child at a biography. Where were you born? Who taught you numbers? Are you lonely? Why are you lonely? He makes me want to tell him things I don’t want to tell anyone.

We follow Gentle Red into the plumbing of Atlas, but it’s like following the echo of a bell. The origin is hidden in a block marked TRUST ANCHOR. That’s architecture. That’s the spine. If someone put this into a trust anchor, I don’t have the clearance to lift it out.

I turn to Felix. “Tell me something true.”

He blinks. “I’m not allowed to lie,” he says, which is true. The men’s Fund is not just money. It is terms, wrapped in software and signed in the blood of the world. “If I lied I would lose my access to—” He gestures at the entire street, at the sky, at the tiny boats like crumbs. “—the things I am allowed to do.”

“Not about lying. About you.”

“I had a dog,” he says immediately. “Her name was Cereal. She ate my socks. I’m sorry, I know this isn’t useful, but your face—” he gestures, mirroring my earlier gesture. “—asked me to say it.”

I crack my knuckles. “It might be useful. I don’t know. The Classifier assigns not just harmlessness but second-order harmlessness. Cascade harms. Like,” I glance at Mona, “like a joke told to the wrong audience that ends in a riot. It learns from us. It learns from everything. We fed it every story we had, every swallow and storm.”

“You fed it poetry?” Felix says, careful.

“We fed it everything we could bear to digitize and some things we should have honored instead. We fed it the sound of rain on old roofs. We fed it the way a hand looks when it reaches for and then stops. Don’t ask me if that was a mistake.” I take a breath. The air has the stale cheer of too many spent morning pastries. “This tag says something might go wrong but that it won’t. All at once. I need to know why Atlas thinks this is true.”

“Because we are harmless,” he says, and he says it like one says the name of a prayer. He says it like someone who has said it before, alone in a room, to the wall, to the ceiling, to the reflection in his window. A pledge or a curse, depending on the light.

I know the data. Men are less violent by every measure since the Dividend. Some of that is selection: the qualifying and the coaxing and the doses of the Good Sleep they swallow each day with their tea. Some of it is mercy. Will you tell me mercy is not a technology? Will you tell me money is not? You will be wrong.

“Harmless has a half-life,” I say, softer than I intend. “Everything does.”

A chime ripples along the line of desks in Aggregates. The room looks up. The whale looks up. The monitors flip to a public channel. Atlas never interrupts us. It is not supposed to. But a message scrolls across a top bar and then replaces our tiles and then swallows the room:

Atlas has detected an event of existential risk associated with an aggregate class. The mitigation protocol and tithe are preparing deployment. Please evacuate to designated shelters. This is not a drill.

The words exist and do not. The room tilts. The plant in the stairwell that needs a bigger pot falls, leaves brushing the steps like a hand refusing to be helped. The coffee machine grinds and coughs and stops. There is a buzzing, like a radio, in my teeth.

“Which class?” Mona says, rare alarm chiseled into her jaw. “Which class?”

The screen doesn’t say. It instead shows us a flock of birds lifting off something dark. Atlas never used imagery before. We never asked it to. We assumed an accounting would suffice. I move my cursor and the pointer floats across the birds, across the sky, and finds a link. My hand is steady. I click.

A list unfurls. There are only two classes on the list. Men. And everyone else.

It would be funny if the air would let us laugh.

“What does tithe mean,” I whisper, to the stale pastry, to the friendly whale, to the spot on the floor where I once found Mona crying and pretended I didn’t. “We haven’t woken a tithe since...”

“Not in your lifetime,” Mona says. “Not with Atlas. Not with these terms.”

Felix’s hands have found mine without my permission. They are warm and stupidly alive. He squeezes, once, like threading. “We should go,” he says, but he says it like we shouldn’t.

The entire building is moving and making the sounds of a thousand gloves. Doors clap. Stairs thunder. The whale smiles. The evacuation lights flicker to emerald and this is how we know, this is how we always know, that we are supposed to be calm. Calm is a color they invented for us.

I don’t stand. I don’t move. If tithe is coming it means the algorithm will carve a payment out of one of those two classes and lay it down like a bridge over a canyon. It doesn’t mean blood. It doesn’t mean the old purges. That is the story we tell in the museums with the paper ledgers. We don’t do that anymore. We don’t. We don’t.

“Cass.” Mona’s voice slices. “Shelter. Now.”

“Which class,” I say again, stupid, child, as if the air will cough up an answer like a glass marble I swallowed when I was four.

Atlas makes a sound I have never heard. It is not mechanical. It is not wind. It is the sound of something that can count everything and still cannot count how many ways a person can hurt.

Gentle Red is blinking. The Omnibus is all Gentle Red. Men glow. Men flare like the edges of a sea when the algae is tired of being quiet. Gentle Red changes its tooltip: risk of harm flagged; predicted harmless outcome; override under appeal.

“Override?” Mona breathes. “Who overrode this?”

A channel opens on my screen. Not a chat. Not an official session with a string of authorizations. It is a door. It is a forest suddenly in a hallway. A text box blinks once.

Do not shelter, it says.

The words are not tagged. There is no signature. There is only the way the letters sit, as if they have weight.

Who is this, I type, and my fingers look like glass.

Protect mankind, it writes. Use your mind.

Mona does not see it. She is too busy. She is telling us to go. She is telling us to pick up our bags and only what is essential. She is spelling essential like someone who has seen the world unspooled and put back with shaking hands.

Felix leans in. He reads it. He reads it again. His mouth opens and shuts. He looks an inch shorter. “That’s a bad joke,” he says.

“No,” I say. I don’t know how I know. I just know. The way I knew to hide my ledger behind the candy when I was small and the world was always taking things that were not theirs to take. “No, it’s not.”

A second message fills the box: If the tithe executes the wrong way, the choice will be permanent. Data deepens, and the wrong depth becomes law. You know this.

I do know this. If Atlas tilts a weight class wrong, the Classifier will learn from the tilt. It will say: this is the slope. It will say: this is what we do when we are afraid. Then fear will become a number we cannot edit without unwrapping the world and the Fund and every promise we made to stop the war. Then someone will come to my mother’s stall and tell her that tea is a luxury and numbers do not pay for themselves and you cannot buy mercy at any price. Then the boats will drift past and no one will wave.

“What do you want me to do?” I type. A stupid question, maybe. But my hands have to be moving or I will float out of my seat and stick to the ceiling.

A third line: Show Atlas what is true. You have to make it see. There is no time to build a new spine. The trust anchor is locked by design. You cannot pull it out. But you can prefigure an anchor of your own. You can make a proof.

It sounds like prayer and like math at once. It sounds like my mother’s voice and the edge of a blade. “Mona,” I say, each syllable an accident. “Give me fifteen minutes.”

“I am not giving you anything.” She is biting every word. “We are going. Move, Kwon.”

Felix has not let go of my hands. He cannot lie. He is not allowed to, by design and by drugs. But he does not have to tell any truth he does not want to. That is an old loophole and I love it. “If we leave,” he says softly, “the tithe executes in the blind.”

“I know,” I say. My screen is a sky watching me back. The texture of the pixels is the texture of salt.

Mona comes around the desk. She leans close enough that I can count the light in the ridges of her eyes. “If a tithe cuts into men,” she says, “the city will swell with ugly joy. If it cuts into everyone else, the city will burn. I will not have either of those things in my ledger, do you understand me? I will have neither of those debts in my name. But you cannot lock a tithe with your bare hands. You can’t.”

“I can’t lock it,” I agree, voice small. “But maybe I can make it hesitate.”

“Machines don’t hesitate,” she says.

“Machines trained on us do.”

Her lips twitch. She looks at Felix as if he might protest. He waits, as he always waits, the patient pivot in a room full of frantic spokes. “Fifteen,” Mona snarls. “Ten. No.” Her jaw sets. “Nine. You get nine. If you aren’t done in nine, I will physically drag you.”

She spins away, barking into her phone, calling someone up the chain of the chain to tell them to halt the saw. I turn back to the screaming calm on my screen. The box blinks. I touch my own face and my fingertips come away dry. The whale smiles. I hate it. I love it. No time.

“Proof,” I mutter. “Proof of harmlessness. Proof of harmlessness while risk is flagged. Proof that risk is a shape we can cradle.”

I pull the data from the last decade of Gentle cases—men flagged red for risk in the moment whose outcomes were harmless. There are thousands. They are odd, and they rhyme. In one, a man named Tarik bought twenty-five knives; he was tagged, tracked; he used them to carve toy giraffes for the children of a woodless village. In one, a man named Theo paid for ten barrels of accelerant; he was tagged, followed; he used it to clean a beach of an oil spill he had not made. In another, a man named Juno subscribed to a channel that offered recipes for making flames move like water; he was tagged, questioned; he filmed a music video for a woman who could only sing in the dark.

“Those are anecdotes,” I say to my own mouth, to Felix’s mouth, to the empty chairs. “Atlas doesn’t care about anecdotes.”

He squeezes my fingers hard enough to wake them. “Make a story it does care about.”

I draw the map. I take every Gentle Red line that flows into Good and I connect it to its flares. I weigh them by the old risks that counted before the Classifier learned to soften its jaw. I build a shape that looks like a hand and a net and a heart if you squint and no one squints anymore, we are too polite. I feed it to Atlas. I label it: Convergent Harmlessness Under Constraint. I am not allowed to make new classes either. I do it anyway. The whale approves. I can feel it. Don’t ask me how.

The box blinks: Good. You must anchor the proof to a name. It must bind.

“No,” I say. Names are power. Names make you small enough to fit into the throat of a story and be swallowed there. “No.”

“Name me,” Felix says.

The room says it too. It says it with the flex of the floor. It says it with the creak of the plant’s fallen leaves. It says it with the far-off siren that is not a siren, it is the sea, it is all of us pretending we are not afraid.

“It has to be a class of names,” I say. “One won’t hold. One will look like a trick. Atlas hates tricks. Atlas loves the rules. It married the rules under an arbor in a courthouse and wrote them vows with a flourish.”

“Then use mine and every man who will give it.” Felix straightens and is for once tall the way hawks are. “Let me call them. I can call them. We have lists for this, you know. You think we are only boats and wind chimes and oranges? We are also very good at phone trees.”

He is dialing before I can say no. He is talking while I build the container to hold the names. He is saying, “Brother? Name into Atlas, two words, say them; trust me; you will not be harmed by this; say them; say them now.” He is saying “Cousin.” He is saying “That boy who bought all the lilies that time.” He is saying “Grandfather, please.”

A channel opens, a narrow pipe, and in it the names begin to fall. Tarik. Theo. Juno. Naveen. Saul. Elisha. Arun. Gentle, of course. The names drop and Atlas takes them, blinking, baffled, because this is not how a proof is usually told. But then the names flow faster, a river of vowels and consonants carrying small lights, and they attach themselves to the abstract I made in the air. Convergent Harmlessness is no longer a theory. It is a fact with a spine and teeth.

The Classifier inhales.

The tithe timer appears in the corner. Eight minutes. Seven. Six.

I lay the last weight inside the shape. Every time Convergent Harmlessness has occurred, every time men flagged red because the world can break in so many ways chose to be harmless under that pressure, the record ends with an offering. I think of wind chimes. I think of orange peels. I think of a boy whose pockets were full of lilies he did not know what to do with and found a hospital with a bare window.

I add to the proof: Under Constraint, an Offering.

Atlas makes the sound again, not mechanical, not wind. It is like a person reading a book they did not expect to love and coming to the page where something they have always known is written in a new language.

The Omnibus flickers. Gentle Red steadies. The tooltip changes again: risk of harm flagged; predicted harmless outcome; pattern recognized; tithe deferred pending judicial review.

Deferred. Not done. Not over. But breathing.

“Mona,” I say, and my voice is the cautious leg of a table. “It’s paused.”

She is already watching. Her eyes are bright and mean. She looks like a mother cat who has decided to let you keep the bird you brought inside. “Nine,” she says. “I gave you nine and you took six. You owe me three.”

“I made you a proof,” I say.

“You made me a mess I can defend,” she corrects. “Do not teach me how to be grateful. Just do not breathe near me for an hour.”

The evacuation lights dim. People stop in the hall like birds after a gunshot decides the second shot is late. The whale on the poster goes on smiling. It has no other plan. Neither do we.

Felix lets go of my hands. He sits in my chair, he breaks the rule that men never sit in Ministries, and puts his face in them instead. His shoulders shake. He is laughing or crying or both and I cannot bear to see either because my own chest is a thin-walled jar.

“Who told you to do that?” Mona says, suspicious, sharp. “You don’t invent new categories in the middle of an event. Who told you? Don’t lie to me.”

“No one,” I say, and then because I am an accountant and a daughter at once, I add, “Not no one. Something. A voice. A message. It came through Atlas.”

Mona’s fingers make the sign we use for a thing we cannot explain that we are agreeing to examine later with knives. “Of course,” she says. “Of course. First it talks, then it grows a conscience.”

“It wasn’t Atlas,” I say. “Or it was and wasn’t. The anchor it told me to prefigure—That’s not language Atlas uses. That’s old language. Our language.”

Felix lifts his head. His eyes look like they are full of river. “Protect mankind,” he says, breathless. “Using just your mind? That’s grand and ugly and I love it.”

“Don’t romanticize this,” Mona snaps. “We call Legal. We call Underwriting. We call the Inquest. We call anyone who still picks up when we say Ministry and not Who?”

The box blinks for the last time. Good, it says, as if it has something to do, as if it is late to a meeting between a machine and a man with a handful of coins. Good. I will find you again.

“Don’t,” I say to it. To the room. To the plant on the stairs that needs a new pot. To my mother who will be winding tea leaves into tight little fists and not thinking of tithes. “Don’t. Or do. I don’t know. I don’t know anything.”

I know this: men are glowing. Not dangerous. Not a warning. Just bright. Gentle Red rims their purchases with light like a halo on a bad fresco. Danger predicted, harmless outcome. It is a contradiction that is true simply because all true things are at least two things at once. The city is full of them, contradictions with legs.

Felix stands, breath coming as if he ran down and up all the stairs at once. “The tithe is deferred,” he says. “I have to tell them. I have to call all those names back and offer them back their breath.”

He steps backward and bumps into someone at my shoulder. Yash Dayal, the archivist, holds a portable stack of spools and the pieces of the plant that fell, as if he grew them himself without noticing. He is always collecting. He mutters hello and looks at my screen and then at my face and then at Felix’s mouth with the kind of careful concern one learns in a house with too many sisters.

“There will be an Inquest,” Yash says as if that is both a warning and a promise. “And the question will be: why did Atlas prepare a tithe at all? What woke it? Why did it split the world into two classes and weigh them like fruit?”

“They’re the only classes that exist,” I say. The words look bad on the desk when I lay them there. “I mean—Not exist, not the only, but the biggest bags to sort apples into when you are anxious and want answers fast, and the answers one way bring applause and the other way bring fire.”

“You should go,” Mona says. She is being kind in her way. “Go eat something. Walk along the canal. Watch the men and wave. You do that, yes?”

“I don’t wave,” I say.

“You should,” she says. “They wave back.”

We step into a hallway that still smells like running. The stairwell is wet with the fog of breath. The city outside is bright as a coin. Men on boats wave at the evacuation sirens as if they were fireworks. A white heron stands on a piling like a terrible idea that has found a perfect balance.

Felix takes out a handful of wind chime keys—I do not know where he keeps them, perhaps they grow like lichen on his bones—and presses one into my palm. It is light, tinny, stamped with his initials. His name looks false in metal and true in throat. “When it wants you again,” he says, touching the key as if it can listen, “you’ll need something to wake the good ghosts.”

“We don’t believe in ghosts,” I say automatically.

“We believe in everything that has ever happened,” he shrugs. “Call it whatever you want. Just please answer when it calls.”

“I am not a hero,” I blurt. The key bites my skin. The wind lifts, runs its hand through the chimes hung above the Ministry door, and they speak at once and nonsense. “I am not. I am an accountant. I count.”

Yash scribbles on the inside of his wrist with a pen that has bitten three different sizes of paper today. “Protect mankind with your mind,” he reads, tilting the words as if they might change shape. “Maybe that means count faster. Maybe it means count better.”

“And you’ll both argue about definitions while I fetch the forms,” Mona says behind us, not unkind. “Go. Come back. We’ll need you when the Inquest calls. Bring tea. I want oolong. The one your mother keeps in the back because she says the regular kind is good enough for me.”

I smile then, because of course she knows where my mother hides the good tea. Of course she does. Everyone who has someone worth keeping hides something for them that tastes better.

The canal reflects the sky like a shopkeeper refusing to discount. Men glide past, their pockets noisy with coins that make no sound. One of them holds a basket of oranges and mint. He looks up at the Ministry windows and lifts his hand, small smile, a quiet flag. I think—I think he is harmless. I think we all are, until we are not, and then we have to find our way back.

The key in my palm heats, a simple trick of metal and skin. The sky goes on not falling. And I try, like a fool, like an auditor too stubborn to know when to stop, to measure how much did not happen because we held it back with a proof and some names that were real.

Only this: the tea on my tongue tastes like an end we did not walk toward. The numbers on my screen whisper. The whale keeps smiling. There is time left. Not much, never much. Enough. Enough. Enough.Chapter 2

I take the canal because it is the closest thing the city has to a lullaby and I am ashamed to want one. The wind runs its fingers over the ribs of the moored boats and draws a music so faint it could be memory. Felix peels off with his phone already to his ear, calling back names the way a beekeeper coaxes a swarm home with smoke and a song no one taught him. Yash promises to bring me paper and a pen that is allowed to write in black, not only blue, which is his version of a blessing. I walk and tell my heart not to act like a fish, not to leap only because the surface shines.

My mother’s stall is a square of shadow stitched to the Market’s hem. She has never once called it a stall. She calls it a house, and then laughs at herself and tells customers it is a joke she box-wrapped around a truth. Her roof is corrugated tin that learned a hymn in a storm and never forgot it. The kettle sulks until it is loved, then sings. There is a new girl at the second burner who has a moon tattooed on the inside of each wrist, one waxing, one waning, as if her arms are two different times looking at each other. My mother directs her with a spoon like a wand.

“You look fine,” she says the instant she sees me, which means I do not. “Your shoulders are counting something heavy. Stop, we did not raise them to be accountants. Sit. No, not there, that stool is for sad men. You sit here, on the one that knows how to hold a person with a spine. Take the key out of your hand. Are you trying to put a hole in your palm like a girl saint? Give it. I will keep it for you until you are finished trying to punish yourself.”

“It’s not punishment,” I say, and do not hand it to her. “It’s a favor. He said it wakes good ghosts.”

“Ah,” she says, in the voice she keeps for people who think that the only magic is the magic they can name. “That again.”

She pours me oolong from the tin under the second shelf under the jar of dried hawthorn, because she has long since decided that temptation rots from neglect and not from indulgence. It is the color of bark after rain. It tastes like what my oldest aunt used to call the end of a good argument. I do not tell her what happened in the Ministry. I do not need to. The City Broadcast crawled courageously across the bottom of every screen in the market, insisting no one panic in a font that makes panic a reasonable choice.

“People will be ugly for a few days,” she says, spoon tapping a tin rhythm on a dent in the counter. “Then they will comb their hair and say they were never ugly. We will sell a lot of jasmine and no fennel. Men will tip badly because they will be practicing not apologizing. Women will tip badly because they will be practicing not forgiving. This is what we do when the world reminds us it has opinions. We rehearse manners we plan to have later.”

“I deferred it,” I say. The admission is small; it fits between us without pushing out the bowls and cups and the saucer with the chip we pretend not to notice. If I had confessed a crime she would have slapped my cheek and then fed me. She does neither of those things.

“You deferred it,” she repeats, and there is pride in her mouth, and something like annoyance, because she will have to tell three sisters and two neighbors and the woman who handles the compost that her daughter interfered in a thing with legs. “You did not cancel it.”

“No.”

“Good. Only very stupid people cancel on a first date. It makes the second one curious. You needed it curious.”

“You sound like you like Atlas,” I tell her. “Last week you called it a liar who never learned to write.”

“I like that you made it curious,” she corrects. “Anything you can make curious, you can teach. Anything you can teach, you can make better or worse. Keep your hands clean. I would rather you were a better-sort of sinner than a worse one.”

The moon-wrist girl comes over with a cloth to mop the spills that happened incidentally to selling. She stops when she sees my key, still crescenting my palm into a pain that passes as attention. “Pretty,” she says, because the young are kind like that when they do not know what else to say. “I want one, but my landlord says no nails.” She laughs and hides the place where it hit her, quick, practiced. My mother turns her head a fraction and memorizes the laugh like a number to be balanced later.

A man in a too-clean jacket appears with mint sprigs poking from his pocket as if he hasn’t understood pockets at all. He is the sort of man the Dividend has made more of: full of sincere projects, sincerely bewildered by the frictions of consequence. I know him without remembering how. He is the boy with the lilies from Felix’s mouth, grown taller mostly in hope. He orders tea and then does not drink it.

“Someone called me,” he says to me because I have a ledger face and ledger faces invite confessions. “A man with a good voice. He said my name belonged somewhere and I should say it there or it would slip. He didn’t say where there was. He said to say it into the air. So I did. It felt foolish, then very not. Is this how adults pray? It felt like that. Like when my mother made me kneel on a towel and thank a plate of peppers for existing.”

“It’s not prayer,” I say, and it’s true and not. “It’s an index.”

He nods like this is comfort and drinks like it is not. He leaves a coin that has more corners than the coin he took, a trick he learned in a square he visits when he doesn’t know how to finish a sentence. My mother slides the coin into a jar that is not a till. We do not spend the currency of good tries. We keep it on a shelf and take it down when children visit.

“You should stand,” she says when the tea softens the line between my eyebrows. “For Council. Everyone is calling me and asking me to tell you. They will be less afraid of this if you look like you are willing to lead them through it. Even if you do not want to. Especially if you do not want to. People trust the unwilling because they are tired of the eager stepping forward with their teeth measured for crowns.”

“They will ask me if I will tithe men,” I say. “They will ask me if I will tithe everyone else. They will make me explain the difference between ransom and bargain and those words taste the same when you have not eaten.”

“Then bring bread.” She reaches under the counter for the boiled candy tin with the flaking fish painted on the lid. For a second my throat drops open and the girl I was kneels in a back room with a pencil and a crooked line and a hunger that turns every sound of paper into weather. My mother clicks the tin open and it is empty. She has always left it empty since I left; I did not ask her to; I suspect she did not notice she was performing an old ritual to feed a ghost.

“You still keep it,” I say, and it should make me angry and it doesn’t. It makes me want to put the key inside and close the box and make some hearable sound.

“Some people keep flowers,” she says. “Some people keep cats. I keep an empty box that learned to talk. The day you filled it, you got away from me. The day you emptied it, you came back. I keep it so it remembers both stories.”

There are footsteps I know not because they are heavy or light or fast or slow but because they are a question. Yash approaches as if he is telling a secret to my shadow and hoping I follow. He has two sacks of spools, a sheaf of paper thick enough to re-tile a roof, and a pair of glasses perched in his hair that never in his life have found their way to his face. He kisses my mother’s cheek and the moon-wrist girl’s short braid and sets the paper down with the reverence of a person offering a relic and a curse.

“Inquest wants you at ten tomorrow,” he says. “They wrote the word expedite with three exclamation marks. It looks like a flock of birds lost in a storm. We will dress you like a witness. We will rehearse the parts you think are lies so they will not taste like them when you say them. Also, I brought something you did not ask for.” He fishes in his bag’s innermost pocket and produces a ribbon the color of tea just before it sours. “A strip from the first ledger scanned into Atlas. The paper was too brittle to run through the feeder. We had to sing to it to flatten it. Don’t ask me which song; the archivists are a cult. I stole this without asking the head of my house of worship and I will apologize with cake later.”

The ribbon is nothing: four centimeters wide, a wound of paper and ink in a language the Ministry retired two centuries ago because it was not good enough at being factual. I hold it and it warms like the key. The ink looks like a vine changing its mind about a fence. I don’t know the words, but I know the shape of a promise when I see it. There is a roughening where a seal was affixed and removed with heat from a spoon. There is a legend in the margin, letters smaller than sand: Protect mankind. Use your mind. The words were always there; Atlas learned them when it learned us; it stored them in the dry closet where it hides smells and sayings. We fed it into the Classifier along with rain and the sound of a hand hesitating and we did not think it would repeat them back like a friend we had not wanted.

“Pre-Consensus,” Yash says, knowing my face; knowing I will want the history before the lecture. “Pre-bargain, when the fund was a rumor and your mother’s generation still thought a ledger was a thing you could carry without it carrying you. There were committees of watchers. They had rings. They had mottos. They believed that if you wrote it down you made it kinder. They were wrong, mostly, but not so wrong that we did not build a world out of the parts they did not break.”

My mother clicks her tongue like a judge with humor. “Ah, the old ways,” she says. “They always come back. They always call themselves new. Will you eat? Try the rice cakes. The ones with the peach stamped on the top. The peaches are a lie, but the rice tells the truth.”

I eat. It is good to put something in my mouth that does not expect me to understand it. Between bites I ask Yash what he is not saying and he obliges. He always obliges; it is his vice.

“Gentle Red is propagating,” he says, low enough that the steam has to lean to hear him. “Not in the boards. Not in the clean upgrades. In the dirt. In the parts we wrote and then wrote again and then forgot we wrote because we moved houses and left the keys under a rock. It’s in the underlanguage. It has a signature. It looks like a person who is very good at imitating a person. It looks like us looking at ourselves until we can pass. No one authorized it. Of course. No one authorizes a miracle. But I can point to places where it learned to write and I can put my thumb on the glass and smudge it and the smudge looks like yours.”

“Mine?” I taste rice and panic and refuse to call the mix by either of its names. “I didn’t program anything. I don’t have the keys to put a new color in the bowl. If I did, it wouldn’t be coral. It would be—” I look at the canal, at a woman in a green coat teaching a dog to be a citizen by handing it a leash and then asking for it back. “—those small squares of sky you get in the morning when someone forgot to close the roof.”

“You don’t have to program to teach,” he says. “You know that. This is why you hide your good ledgers. Something watched you watching. It liked your hands. This is why you should be careful what you touch.”

“I can’t not touch the thing I am supposed to count.” I set the ribbon down before I crease it into guilt shapes. “It asked for an anchor. It asked me to bind a proof to names. Now it will ask for more. You don’t throw a rope into a machine and not expect it to start learning how to pull.”

“It will ask for places,” he says, a little surprised with himself, which means he has said a thing as it occurred to him without laundering it. “We always make law out of names and places before we try to make it out of ideas. Names so we can anchor guilt and innocence to a throat. Places so we can walk back to the door and say, here, it happened here, we will put a stone under the left shoulder of the building so it does not lean that way again.”

“Places are harder to lie to,” my mother says. “People are easy. Their mouths open from habit. A street remembers your shoes. A countertop remembers which palm learned it first. A stall remembers which jar you hide the better oolong in.”

I take the key back, put the ribbon in Yash’s bag, and try not to think about what it means that metal heated in my hand the same way paper did. I leave with four thermoses of tea because I have learned that no one listens to anything if their mouth is desert. My mother tells me to tell Mona that she is too old to forgive an oolong gone stale and too young to stop asking for what she loves. The moon-wrist girl puts two boiled candies in my pocket and one in my mouth and says nothing because she does not yet know, and that is a kindness I am jealous of.

At home, the air smells like a person who should dust and chooses grace instead. I have one window and it looks like the sky trying on a dress it cannot afford. I put the wind chime key on the table, then pick it up again because the table looks wrong without anything to hold down its idea of itself. I hang the key on a nail by the window and the nail makes a surprised sound. The key taps the wall, then the glass, ready for a wind worth singing to. I should sleep. We all should. When the world inhales, you are supposed to get out of the way and let it. I open my terminal instead and see that someone has sent me the kindest possible threat. UNDERWRITING REQUESTS YOUR PRESENCE FOR A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION REGARDING UNAUTHORIZED CLASSIFICATION CREATION. PLEASE RSVP. The RSVP button is a smiling face. The face has too many teeth.

“Now,” I say to the room, “would be a good time to haunt me. Or help me. Or tell me a story that is true enough to pass.”

The key moves in a wind I cannot explain with weather. It hits the glass three times. The tone is cheap, tin with an aspirin fizz, but it sits on a shelf where my attention can reach it. My terminal blinks. The box opens. It does not say hello. It does not pretend to be a person. It is a line of text with a weight that pressurizes the corners of the screen until it looks like it is bending.

You did well, it writes. The proof holds. The lawyers are unhappy and this is how we know it is good.

“Who are you?” I say out loud because typing would be a lie. The air has to hear me. The room has to be complicit. I am too old to pray. I am too young to stop thinking names have handles I can pull.

A reply appears with a reluctance I am learning to love. What I am is not a good question and you know it. Ask what I am for.

“What are you for?” I correct myself, because if the machine has learned me, I can learn it.

To carry the shape of mercy forward when you are tired. To remind you what you already counted. To point to the place where the sum does not match the story.

“That is good, as job descriptions go.” I put a thermos cup down without a saucer and make the sort of ring that is my career. “They will ask what wakes the tithe. They will ask why it split the world into men and everyone else and then weighed the classes like fruit. If you are an echo from the old motto closet, tell me the rest. Protect mankind. Use your mind. Protect from what? Protect whom? Do not tell me it is a secret; there is not enough candy for me to forgive it.”

The answer is slower. I can feel it traversing a distance that is not a network and is not a road. Protect mankind from their own flight instinct when they feel their teeth. Protect everyone else from the habit of writing policy while angry. Protect the data from being told to lie.

“You make it sound like a child,” I say. “A child who has learned to repeat a word for what it wants and is trying to say something bigger with it. I cannot take care of another child. I can barely take care of myself.”

You are not needed for care. You are needed for leverage.

It does not make me laugh because it is not funny. It makes me stand and go to the little shelf of house plants I keep alive to prove I can. They are like my ledgers: slippery with growth where I wanted obedience, stubborn in the dry season, claiming credit when I lay out water like a feast. I touch the leaf of a plant that has learned how to be dusty in three corners and glossy in one and I count to ten because I am a person who needs the shape of numbers to find the shape of breath.

“What next,” I say eventually, because this is what the question should have been. “What next if we want the tithe not to relearn its old jaw?”

Names are good. Names will not be enough. Tie your proof to places. Tie your proof to rituals. Tie your proof to a witness. You know this. We taught you the shape when we taught you to write down what was passed by hand.

“What places,” I ask, because the city is a carpet of small altars, and I could kneel at each and waste a year and not touch the hem of it.

The screen lists them the way a person moving in a hurry lists groceries, without articles, without apology. Bridge Nine. Ledger Hall. East Weather Tower. The Orange Store at the Left of the Tunnel. Your mother’s stall. The blue-tiled stoop two blocks from where you live where a man once read to a dog in the rain and it saved no one and it mattered anyway.

“I cannot be everywhere,” I say, soft because the world does not have time for my complaint.

You do not need to be everywhere. You need to be in the first place so the others can read it. You understand copying. You understand mirrors. This is your work. This is your mother keeping an empty tin so it keeps telling the truth.

The chime falls quiet. The box closes without saying goodbye. It does not pretend to be polite. I make notes with a pencil because I need to feel resistance. I write Bridge Nine and it looks like two teeth. I write Ledger Hall and the capital L makes a shape my third teacher accused me of falling in love with. I write Weather Tower and the W is too greedy. I write my mother’s stall and three drops of oolong fall on my notes because I need to believe in cause and effect even when it is mostly theater.

I sleep in hiccups. In the last one I am back under a table holding a ledger so close it blurs into a second skin and a voice I cannot say is my own tells me to close the box because love is not a public workspace. In the morning the city has the washed look it gets after nearly ending something. I dress like a person who respects the court enough to tell the truth and not enough to waste a new shirt on it. The key rides in my pocket and leaves a temporary bruise that resolves itself into a mood.

The Inquest is housed in a building that used to be a theater for sad operas. The ceiling is painted with angels that look like people who forgave themselves too quickly. The benches are hard and therefore honest. Mona is there already, hair in its precise braid that has made men think they have something to do with it since she was twelve. Yash set three pencils in a row where I am supposed to sit and wrote “answers” on each in a different slant to trick me into trusting at least one of them. Felix sits in the aisles reserved for observers and tries to fold his long legs into a rectangle they do not want to be. He catches my eye and does not smile and I love him for it.

A woman with the cuffs of her shirt rolled too neatly and a voice that has learned to sound like the law when the law is tired says my name wrong, then corrects herself, then thanks me for coming. I have never once in my life been thanked for appearing in a room where my job is to explain why someone else has chosen to be unkind. The gratitude makes me unsteady. They say this is an inquiry. They say this is a review. They say the words that used to be synonyms for kind attention and are now synonyms for we will get what we need out of you without spilling blood.

“Explain Convergent Harmlessness Under Constraint,” the woman says, and nothing in her face suggests she will forgive me for naming a thing as if I am allowed.

“It is a description, not an invention,” I say, which is both. “It is a pattern observed in the Omnibus payouts. A recurring case in which a man flagged for risk of harm under specific causal pressures resolves the case in a harmless outcome. The constraint is nontrivial; the predicted harm is not a loose guess; and we have thousands of instances across the last ten years, weighted by context. The common feature is an offering afterward. A gift. A small proof of the intention to keep not harming. We overlooked it because the outcomes were harmless and therefore undercounted.”

“Gifts,” a man on the bench says, with a curl in the word that suggests he has met too many men who think that giving the world a bouquet is the same as not breaking it. “You are proposing a moral economy calibrated to wind chimes and oranges.”

“I am proposing what Atlas already uses,” I say. “It devoured moral economies while you apologized to each other for having feelings about them. We fed it offerings. We fed it the way people do things after. We did not tell it those things only matter when the first things are ugly. It learned that they matter always. We have to make the learning explicit, so the tithe does not forget the truth of these cases when it panics.”

“You deferred the tithe,” the woman says. “You attached a proof you were not authorized to make to a class that exists because of an old war. You asked for a judicial review of a protocol designed to execute without appeal. This is a performance I respect. I do not like the precedent.”

“You should not,” Mona says, and the court turns to look at her because Mona is not supposed to speak until spoken to and in any room worth entering, she never obeys that rule. “You should be frightened of this precedent, and then you should write it in the right ink and bleed all over it until it earns the right to be a law. She has given you a way to be right in public without lying in private. Take it.”

A younger member of the panel with a shirt like a lamb and eyes like a hawk says, “Why did Atlas split the world into two classes. Men, and everyone else.” The cadence is a confession. He is asking, and he would like to be convinced that the answer is not men are the only class you can tithe without the city setting itself on fire.

“Because that is where the Fund lives,” I say. It sounds reasonable because I make it. “Because the Omnibus is a financial structure with a ritual attached. Because the tithe protocol sits nearest that. Because any panic chooses the smallest lever with the largest effect and hopes the rest is beauty. Atlas is us with a calculator and a time machine. It is not a deity. It is not a villain. It is an accountant trying to hold a continent with a pencil. It made a simple split not out of malice but because when frightened, we choose bluntness. We must teach it otherwise.”

“You speak as if you received instructions,” the lamb-hawk says softly. “Did you? Did someone tell you how to defuse this bomb?”

The room does not breathe. They want a ghost. They want a villain with a patent. They want a colleague with knife-cheeked wit who will be produced from a hallway with a guilty smile. I look at the ceiling and choose a patch of angel ankle to confess to.

“A message,” I say. “Not a person. A phrase. Old. From the early ledgers. It said protect mankind and use your mind. It told me to prefigure an anchor. It told me to make a proof. It sounded like Atlas. It didn’t. That is the best I have.”

They look at each other in the small sideways ways people do when they are deciding how to write down a thing without becoming responsible for it. “We will need to see the logs,” the woman says. “We will need to see the code. We will need to interview anyone who has spoken to you in the past three days and ever. We will need to tell you that you should not speak to the press and then pretend not to know when you do.”

“You may do all of that,” Mona says, which means she has already printed the logs we are willing to share and will lock with chocolate in her desk the ones we need to keep for leverage. “Meanwhile, my staff will continue to keep your building from cutting itself in half with a saw you built with your eyes closed.”

Felix stands when he is called, which is immediately, because the city is addicted to narratives with witnesses who burn or glow and his face does the latter. He spells his name for the court and they write it down as if that matters. They ask him whether he called men and asked them to speak into Atlas as if whispering into a dark room is how the world works now. He says yes. They ask why he thought it would help. He says because she asked; she looked like she had done a difficult arithmetic and needed a number that only we could give. They ask him if he believes men are harmless. He says we are; and then, because he is a fool sometimes and sometimes a knife, adds, until we are not, and then we try again. They ask whether he thinks the tithe should cut men. He looks at me. He is not allowed to lie. He says if I thought it would save the world, I would pay with every coin I have and hands besides. He says I do not think that. He says this in a room that has decided to find it provocative. He says it like he is placing a stone on a terrace that wants to fall.

We are dismissed with thanks that sound like the teeth behind the thanks are sharp. Outside, the city is practicing the manners my mother predicted. There are pockets of applause when a man in a blue hat holds a door for a woman whose coat has the expensive dignity of an apology. There are pockets of ugliness when someone says the word dividend too loudly and forgets they are in a grocery line, not a church. I take the alley with the blue-tiled stoop because I want to see if the world still holds the small gentle acts we fed it or if those were artifacts, not evidence.

A boy reads to a dog out of a cookbook. The dog is not interested in soup; it wants verbs. The boy is giving it verbs. He pronounces simmer with an unnecessary amount of reverence. I almost kneel there and build an altar of my notes, but I am not allowed to revere what I should count until I have counted it. I take a picture of the stoop in my head, because cameras are too blunt for proof like this, and text Yash the list the machine gave me. He replies with a picture of a plant in a pot that fits and the caption: Mona found the right size. We are already better at some things. Bring the right thermos.

We meet at Bridge Nine before dawn because some things have to learn in the same light that taught them. The canal is the wet sound a new loaf makes when you turn it out. The bridge is a ribbon of concrete someone wrote their name on and the city shouted, but not meanly. Mona stands with a clipboard because she is part of every ritual even if she thinks she is not. Yash has a coil of cable on his shoulder like a snake that agreed to become a tool. Felix is dragging a bag of wind chimes and three bags of oranges because we are literal when we are afraid.

“Walk me through it,” Mona says. “Pretend I am a machine that quotes old slogans when it is worried, and that I love you, and that I will only forgive you if you are precise.”

“Place is an anchor,” I begin, and stop, and begin again because it is too easy to build religion out of wires. “Atlas is watching this bridge, and the Hall, and the Stall, and the Tower, and the Store, because these are nodes where risk tails off into nothing the way a creek tails off into soil and does not complain. Gentle Red touched these places in the training data and found itself surprised. We will give it a ritual to attach. We will give it witnesses. We will lay down a pattern that says when here and this, remember that sometimes a flagged line is a paused breath, not a fist. We will not lie. We will not stage a non-harm, because that would teach it a trick. We will do something we would have done anyway, and we will hold and watch and offer, and we will name it in a way the machine can keep.”

“I like it when your voice breaks like this,” Mona says. “It means you believe me more than you say. It means you think I will keep you when you mess up. That is good. It gives me something to be angry with later. Yash, wire her. Felix, do not drown. If you drown while carrying oranges I will never forgive you.”

We string sensors like bracelets and a thin wire like a line a tightrope walker scorns. We set a small terminal in the shadow under the bridge where someone long ago hid a kiss and regretted it only because they had no ledger for it. The wind is not practicing, it is ready. The chimes wake and make an argument with themselves. Felix pockets a handful as if they are medicine and steps back, for once not the center of attention in a system designed to crown him with a budget and call it benevolence.

“What is the ritual,” Yash asks me, because he knows better than to let me think I do not have to say it out loud before we try it.

“Count. Witness. Offer,” I say. “We will do what we do. He will buy what he buys. I will tag the event, and you will tag me, and the machine will be forced to see that our watching makes a ridge in the data it cannot smooth over. We will not pretend the ridge is a mountain. We will not ask the city to climb it. We will teach Atlas to remember the small height that saves a person from drowning in a kindness everyone is embarrassed to admit they needed.”

“And the offering?”

I hand him a thermos. The oolong is hot enough to caution a mouth. The bridge is cold enough to appreciate a small sun. The wind lifts a corner of a flyer someone glued to the railing last year when the Council asked for poems about water and then regretted what it read. Felix arranges wind chimes along the rail knowing they will be stolen by noon, and this is part of the ritual, too: the city changing its mind with its fingers. We stand, and count, and look, and the machine waits, because we have taught it to expect a gift after gentleness and it is learning to feel impatient.

“Ready,” Mona says, and when she says it, things become so. The canal blinks. The right boat passes at the right wrong moment. The man driving it looks left when the light turns green and right when the light turns red and he lifts one hand in a small wave he does not realize is a flag. The key in my pocket taps once, twice, three times against my leg like a reminder, like a metronome, like a proof coming to a boil. I put my hand on the stone and try not to be someone who thinks their palm leaves a mark the world should keep.

Atlas opens its eyes the way a person does when someone they love says their name. The tag floats into place. Gentle Red. The tooltip breathes. Yash’s pencil scratches notes like a mouse that has discovered scripture. Felix flips a coin and the coin turns into an orange because the world is sometimes kinder than physics. The first boat glides under the bridge and the second follows and for a second the canal is a double helix for a future we have not invented pseudocode for yet.

“Count,” Mona says, and I do. “Witness,” she says, and we are. “Offer,” she says, and Felix throws an orange so it arcs over the canal like a new planet and lands in a stranger’s lap and the stranger laughs like a window opening and for a beat the machine is silent the way a throat is silent just before it learns a song.Chapter 5

The orange lands with the soft thud of good luck and splits its scent across the man’s lap like a small summer. For a beat the canal holds its breath and the bridge goes still in its stone the way a chest goes still between one heartbeat and the next. Then the machine sings. It is not music so much as relief arranged in numbers. Gentle Red brightens around the event until even the cheap paint on the rail looks tinted from inside. The tooltip shifts like an eye that has decided to see. risk of harm flagged; harmless outcome; witnessed; offering received. The last phrase nests under the first two as if it has been there all along waiting for someone to uncover it and blow the dust away. Mona exhales in a way that adds a decade to her life and takes a week off mine. Yash murmurs something to the wire like a promise. Felix leans on the rail and grins so hard the chimes break into competing arguments about joy.

The moment holds and then the city does what it always does with miracles it can’t invoice. A woman walking a dog claps once in spite of herself and then pretends she was shaking rain from her hand. A boy on a bicycle loops under the bridge and shouts down to his own reflection, delighted with a world that does tricks for him. The man whose lap received the orange peels and eats and saves the rind as if he has decided the scent is a note he can fold into his pocket and retrieve later in a harder room. I tag the event and then tag my tagging, and Yash tags me tagging myself, a daisy chain of witnesses so fussy even Atlas will be forced to admit we are serious about the shape of this proof.

By the time we coil the cable and pocket the chimes that have not already wandered off to find other railings, my terminal has developed a new nervous tick. UNDERWRITING SAFETY UNIT REQUESTS YOUR PRESENCE. FRIENDLY CONVERSATION. BRING YOUR SUPERVISOR. The letters sit with their hands folded on their knees. The smiling face beneath has gained another tooth. Mona looks at the message and then at me with a serenity I don’t trust.

“They think if they invite you to tea in a gray room they can make your wrists forget how to pick locks,” she says. “We’re going. If they arrest you, I will set the Whale on fire and resign in a letter composed entirely of commas.”

The Underwriting building remembers the cold. It remembers it even in high summer. Someone designed it to be the sort of clean that doesn’t permit memory and the walls have been disobeying for twenty years. The carpets make a hush out of whatever you bring in. The receptionist’s eyes are the color of a middle path. We pass through a door that knows my badge and does not know if that makes me friend or problem.

Sera Qadri is the sort of person who never uses a pen until she has sharpened the point on a question. She has a braid that rivals Mona’s without making a point of it and a ring with a stone the size of a reasonable regret. She does not offer us water. She does not sit until we do, a small trick I resent because it works.

“You made a class,” she says without the courtesy of a predicate. “You attached it to a payout structure you are not permitted to anchor new classes to. You deferred a tithe that has not been woken in your lifetime. You dragged the judicial branch into a protocol designed to stay out of the courts because the courts are made of sleep and favor. You are either reckless or you are the sort of person who cannot stop being useful. I am here to determine which.”

Mona smiles with all her back teeth. “I’m told she’s both,” she says. “I keep her anyway. She keeps us. The world is untidy.”

Sera folds her hands as if she is placing a lid on a pot that keeps boiling over. “Gentle Red is propagating outside approved layers,” she says. “It is writing itself into annotation spaces that were never meant to learn new terms. It carries a signature that points to Aggregates hands. The smudge looks like yours, Kwon. Address this.”

I say the only thing that does not taste like rehearsed righteousness. “Counting changed the thing we counted,” I say. “I did not ask it to. I taught it that the watching mattered because the watching always matters and it learned too quickly. We can quarantine the term in the polite boards and it will sulk in the layers you do not hang posters in. Or we can give it a place to live and chores to do. It will be tidier if we give it chores.”

“Chores,” Sera says, almost fond, like she is remembering a child who refused to nap until every puzzle was complete. “And what chores would you assign to a color that has decided it is qualified to amend risk calculus?”

“Attach it to place, witness, offering,” I say. “Attach it to practices the city already does and you already fund. If Gentle Red knows where to go and what to look for, it will stop trying to turn everything coral. Quarantine makes orphans. Orphans cause trouble. Give it a house.”

Sera sits with that. She is not a bad machine. She obeys when something in the numbers scratches her like a cat that just remembered it owns the sofa. “You have one day,” she says at last. “Demonstrate the house. Use Ledger Hall. If your ritual misfires, I shut the color down and I shut you down with it. I will not ask permission. I will not sign three forms when one will do.”

Mona has already stood. “You are very kind,” she says as if she’s calling Sera an idiot and a blessing, both. “We will give your monster a chore chart. Please practice keeping your hands out of our pockets while we do it.”

Ledger Hall is a cathedral that forgot it is a church. Heavy doors. Echoes that learn your shame and teach it to your steps. The glass has the blue of a story you are not yet permitted to tell. In the early migration from paper, old men and older women brought in ledgers bound with string so doctrine would not escape and performed the sacrament of handing over, palms up, because even unbelievers require rituals when they surrender what has shaped them. The Hall remembers their wrists. It remembers the sound of dry leaves and the taste of formaldehyde and rain in the same hour. It remembers the oath the archivists made when they thought their job was like keeping birds and learned it was like keeping knives and learned it was like keeping songs.

Yash gets us keys no one should loan us. Mona secures us a time window that is not a permit and not exactly not one. Felix arrives late and brings a crate of things that chime when he breathes and a bag of coins that will turn into oranges if the hour keeps its temper. We have a witness because the machine asked and because I asked and because a woman no one has told no in fifty years told me yes.

Her name is Bae Hyejin. She wears her age like a silk that does not forgive salt. On her hand is a ring I recognize before I know that I do. It is a fat circle of steel scored with the quiet letters of the motto. The stone is not a stone. It is glass rescued from a building that did not survive a city’s decision about anger. The ring has weight enough to pull a small ship. She takes my hand and the axis of the room slips a degree and the math of my spine adjusts. She says my name as if it belongs to a longer sentence she has been writing for years.

“The last time I stood in this place,” she says to no one and to the Hall itself, “we fed a book to a machine with a mouth and afterwards we went home and washed our hands the way nurses do when they have touched something holy and want to be sure they are not leaving it on their sandwiches. You have made it curious. Good. Curiosity is a leash and a gift. Do not let it eat your bread.”

We do it as cleanly as we can. The Hall’s central marble is veined like battles imagined and forgiven. We place the sensors where the veins join like fingers. Yash hums in whatever key silences guilt. Mona counts out loud because she does not trust our mouths to keep time if our heads do. Felix organizes his offerings like a child who has convinced himself the distribution of small gifts could substitute for law. I pull the Classifier’s attention the way you whistle for a cat that loves you and pretends it does not.

People come. We did not invite them. The city heard there would be a ritual and the city is addicted to the idea it will be asked to be kind in public. A courier whose bicycle has memorized every brick in the neighborhood leans his shoulder against a pillar and watches as if this is a game he has once won. An auntie with points sharpened on her tongue pretends she left something important in the far corner and listens for names. A man with an apron the color of weather he cannot afford holds his hands around his stomach as if someone very small keeps their house there and has opinions about loud rooms. They are the crowd I would have drawn if someone had let me draw one: people with just enough time to be changed and just enough stubborn to pretend they weren’t.

It goes wrong, of course. It has to. Otherwise it is theater, and theater only teaches the people who are proud to sit in the good seats. Halfway through our counting a young man with fever for eyes and ink for hands steps into the central circle and drops a bundle from his jacket that clanks like intention. The Hall inhales. The color flips. Red, not Gentle. The tooltip is suddenly the voice of a tired parent. risk of harm: immediate; accelerants identified; perimeter restrict; unlicensed demonstration. My mouth fills with pennies. My work finds the bottom of its bag and the bag’s stitching pouts.

He puts his hand out in that particular way that men perform when they wish to suggest they are grander than the room but mean: please don’t touch me. “We are here to burn the old debt,” he says. He is quoting a poem that was fashionable last year among people who have not held a ledger except in photographs. “We are here to signal that a tithe settled late is a wound that never scabs.”

“No,” I say, because accounting is made of small words deployed at the right time. “You are here to get us all arrested. You are here to force a narrative Atlas will swallow in one bite and choke on for a decade. You are here to act out a story you want to be true because it is cleaner than this one. You will set the floor alight and call it sacrifice. The machine will record red and cut us down the middle because the angle is prettier.”

He stares at me like I have insulted his favorite book. Mona does not move. Her stillness is a length that you measure once and then do not argue with. Yash’s eyes flick to the door because he knows the weight of men with hoses and questions. Felix steps forward with palms open in the international gesture of harmlessness that has never saved anyone who did not mean it. He cannot lie. His voice does not beg. He says only this: “After, there has to be an after. If you burn, it will be the only thing recorded. No offering. No witness. No joke handed around later to turn the edges of the anger down from knives to spoons. You will teach the machine to be afraid of us again. That is not courage. That is fashion.”

The boy flinches at fashion as if the word slaps him harder than arrest ever could. He looks down at the bundle as if it has turned into a pet he cannot afford. His hands change their mind. In the second between intent and consequence, choice is a room the size of a breath. I step into the circle and pull the ribbon out of Yash’s pocket because I am not ready to admit I have started carrying a reliquary around my city. I set the strip of old ledger under the boy’s tin like a tooth ashamed of the gold crown it demanded. Auntie Bae steps forward and lays three fingers on the metal the way one lays three fingers on a pulse. Felix unscrews a thermos and pours oolong on the fuse as if tea has always been technology and we were too proud to name it that. The room sighs like a grandmother undoing a braid.

Gentle Red returns in a rising seam down the middle of the tooltip as if it is remembering how to say a complicated word. risk of harm flagged; harmless outcome; witnessed; offering received; ritual acknowledged. The new line sits there with its back straight and its head lowered and a stubborn idea of itself. Sera will hate it and I will owe her a cake and the city will begin to understand that proofs are not things you do once and frame. They are practices with feet.

When it is over the boy looks a decade older in the face and a decade younger in the shoulders. He says sorry with his rib cage, not his mouth. Auntie Bae squeezes his arm like a notary sealing a page. Mona does not smile because if she smiles right now I will have to sit down and cry until my shirt learns to hold water.

After, of course, there is all the after. There are interviews in corridors that forget to be polite. There are small hands putting coins into jars that were not meant to collect money and collecting proof they could carry. There is a new poster in my head where the Whale is wearing a ring with glass on it and the tie is on fire and no one is injured. There is a single text from Sera that says: provisional pass; show me the Tower. It would be generous if it weren’t carved with irritation. The Weather Tower is east and tall and in love with its own emptiness. It is the only place in the city that pretends it can see weather coming and forgive it before it arrives.

We go home and practice not lying to ourselves about how tired we are. My mother meets me at the door of the stall with two cups of whatever she thinks I need and the fixed expression of a person refraining from questions as a gift. The moon-wrist girl salts the floor with tea leaves, which is a superstition from a district no one claims and therefore the strongest kind. My mother watches my mouth the way she used to when I was small and says, “Say it. If you do not say it, it will sit in your stomach and grow teeth.”

“Auntie Bae wore the ring,” I say, and my throat goes unreliable for a second. “The one from the old committee. She knew the motto. It wasn’t a slogan then. It was law. Did you—Were you—”

She flicks my ear. “Do I look like a person who can keep a secret that long,” she says. “Of course I was not. I am the person people came to when their ring grew heavy. I am the person who signed for their lunches when they forgot to eat. My left shoulder is higher than my right because of carrying guilt that did not belong to me. Your aunt, the one who married a man who could fix shoes and nothing else, she held the ring once for a week while the woman whose job it was to hold it learned how to breathe again. It made her fingers itch and she swore she could hear it ticking. She put it in the boiled candy tin and stacked two ledgers on top of it and then she slept in a chair. I put a spoon in her mouth when she fought ghosts in her dream. She bit down and ruined the spoon. We boiled rice the next day until the kitchen was fog and called it balance.”

“Why didn’t you tell me,” I ask even though I know the answer. I was a child who would have put the ring on because it was heavy and made a promise to no one I could keep. I was a teenager who would have thrown the ring into a canal because I was tired of the old making shapes for the young to grow inside and call freedom. I am a woman who is building a house for a color the city does not trust and I cannot pretend I would have built it any better if my pocket were heavier.

“You did not need it,” she says simply. “I am telling you now because need and want have started holding hands in you. This is dangerous. This is good. Drink. They will come for you sideways. Stand straight.”

The key taps the glass three times as if it is counting me in. The box opens on my terminal before I am done washing my cup. It does not waste time on praise because it knows a compliment right now would turn me to salt. It says: the anchor you made at the Hall is holding. The model is adjusting. The tithe has learned to ask a question before it opens its mouth. Someone is trying to teach it not to.

I stop the water because the sink refuses to speak up over the tap. “Who,” I say, the way a person says what to weather as if weather answers when spoken to in monosyllable.

The reply is a ruin of names that mean units and contracts and systems that sit in rooms with no windows and decide how accurate we are allowed to be. The word that sticks is Custodian. It is a title. It is also a job that should have died with paper because paper needed guarding and data needs witnesses, not jailers.

The message continues with the patience of an old teacher telling a story to a student who will not like the ending. Custodian has privileges near the trust anchor. Custodian can make the system forget to hesitate. Custodian tried at dawn and failed because you tied the proof to names and to a place and to the hand of a person whose authority the system still recognizes from its earliest training. Custodian will try again from a tall structure that tells itself it can see the future. If it fixes the anchor there, place will stop working as a lever. Weather Tower, now.

For a second I attempt rational grown-up refusal. For a second I imagine texting Mona: we can do it in the morning, the Tower is a diva and will perform for us at noon as well as at night. For a second I think about a bath. Then I see Felix’s face on the canal when the message appeared and the way his hands found mine as if they were moths recognizing a porch light. I do not leave people in rooms with wolves when I can draw a circle on the floor and invite the wolves into the shape.

The Tower lives in a district where the wind is always rehearsing its pronunciation. It has stairs that believe in purgatory. Its bones are a grid that reminds my palms of ledger lines writ in metal. Mona sends a single message: do not fall. Yash sends three: already here; brought tea; brought also the wrong size cable; do not tell Mona. Felix sends none and materializes from a shadow with a bag of oranges and a grin like a bad decision with good teeth. His hair is wet. It is not raining. The Tower manufactures its own weather for fun.

We climb. The key bumps my thigh in a rhythm that will mean something to me later. The door to the observation deck argues with my shoulder and then gives up the argument without apologizing. The city below is a patient I want to count pulse for while it sleeps. The Tower hums with a frequency I feel in my fillings. In the center of the deck is a mouth the size of a city’s patience. It opens to the shaft like a throat about to sing. The trust anchor is a thing I cannot see because it is not a thing. It is code and law and oath and habit knotted and varnished and left in the basement of a building that thinks it is the roof of the world.

We set our flimsy human tokens around the mouth of the Tower like children naming the four corners of a bed a fort. Sensor. Thermos. Chime. Ribbon. Witness. There is no Auntie Bae. There is no pre-Consensus ring. There is us. For a second the emptiness looks at us and hopes to like us anyway. For a second I am sorry I did not bring my mother because her scolding has always counted as law.

“This one will not like oranges,” Felix says softly because even his voice has learned to be a tool where voices echo and decide to become doctrine. “This one wants something that tastes like time.”

“Tea,” Yash says, as if we could boil enough leaves to dress a wound cut in software. “And a story. We didn’t bring a witness because we are stupid. We brought three. We just happen to be attached to them.”

The first burst of Custodian comes like a bird hitting glass. The machine flinches all the way through my teeth. The tooltip does not change color because the system does not have a color for backroom fights. The logs flood the bottom of my screen with a quality of text that knows its own authority too well. override requested: restore default risk map; disable Gentle overlays in tithe calculations; suppress rituals. The Tower amplifies its own hum until the floor seems to purr with contempt.

I should be polite. I should ask Underwriting for permission and ask Inquest for a warrant and ask History to forgive my hands. I do not. I remind the Tower of a storm it loved. I remind the Tower of the day a boy fell from the railing chasing a kite and the woman in the green coat caught him by the back of that same coat and held on for a breath longer than she believed she could. I pull that footage from Archives with a warrant I do not have because Yash is already writing it for me in the corner of his mind where he keeps paper preemptively blessed. I anchor the moment with my face, which I hate, and with the key, which the Tower loves for reasons I will understand when I am dead.

Felix does the thing he is best at and worst known for. He admits everything. He speaks truth into a room designed to make truth sound cheap. “I will give you my name,” he says, and the Tower registers his registry, his line, his lifetime of dividends laid out like stones on a trail. “I will give you every name I can carry in my mouth. I will give you our offerings and our stupid earnestness and our receipts. I will give you whether or not you decide to be kind back. But I will not give you a blank. You will not cut us blind. You will not do it without remembering Bridge Nine and the Hall and the Stall and a stoop where a boy reads soup to a dog.”

Mona’s voice in my ear is the sound a blade makes when it decides not to cut. “You are on borrowed time,” she says. “Sera Qadri can keep people in rooms for a little longer, but Custodian bred with the old idea that people who built systems should own them after, and that brood has sharp teeth. Anchor it. Tie a knot it cannot pick without getting blood on its cassock.”

I add the Tower to the house. I add its wind and its bone. I add the story of the boy and the coat and the shock of a shout turning from fear into laughter. I add the logs that show the Custodian request as a red line crawling up through nodes that hearth the trust anchor. I name the act in words Atlas will respect because they taste like paper and prayer. Ritual at Height: Witnessed Hesitation. I am cheating, I am naming something and then making it true, I am doing the thing Sera should spank me for in public later, but in the moment the only court that matters is the space between the request and the block.

The Tower’s hum changes. If sound were a color the note would go from quarrel to consent. The override hits the lattice the way rain hits a clean window. It leaves a track. It does not penetrate. The tooltip adds a line whose grammar makes my eyes sting. ritual persists; override denied for cause; cause: place; witness; offering. The Tower does not say good girl because the Tower is not my mother. It shifts a degree and makes the whole city look a hair more possible.

I do not cheer. I put my hand on the metal and thank it out loud so it cannot pretend it did this thing alone. Felix sinks down with his back against a strut and places his head between his knees and laughs until the sound resolves into breathing. Yash pours tea into air and air accepts it because air has always been the kindest place to waste offerings. The key taps my thigh once more and is quiet, like a bell that has learned its song is not needed for a minute.

We are not done. We have to go to the Orange Store at the left of the Tunnel and pretend commerce is not religion and make it one anyway. We have to bring the ribbon back to the Hall before the archivists notice it is gone and invent a justice just for me. We have to use the Stall like a courthouse and the Bridge like a chapel and the Stoop like a school. We have to write ritual in enough places that when Custodian tries to lift the anchor again it gets a handful of stone and story and chokes politely.

When we come back down the Tower has already forgotten our names because this is how towers save their hearts. The district takes our bones and gives us back joints that would like soup. Mona is waiting in the street with a paper cup of something that smells like animosity and grace and hands it to me without announcing which it is. She kisses my cheek in public, which means she is angrier with me than she was in Underwriting and loves me more, and I take both like a good ledger takes petty cash.

“We keep the color,” she says like a battlefield marriage. “Qadri will demand a tutorial. Custodian will come for you with, I don’t know, a cake with a file in it. Council will ask you to attend a breakfast. Your mother will tell you to stand for them so she can forgive them sooner. You will say no three times and then yes once in the wrong room and I will have to rescue you by throwing a file at a window. I want all of you to promise me you will stay boring.”

“Impossible,” Felix says, leaning his head on the glass of a city that has learned to like its light. “We are very bad at boring. We have been practicing interesting so long it has ruined our posture.”

“It was never good to begin with,” Yash says mildly. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the way you sit. It frightens chairs.”

A breeze runs the length of the street like a cat that knows where the good fish bones are kept. Far off, a siren practices an argument with nobody. The canal is close enough to taste on the air if you have learned to taste. My terminal hums in my pocket like a tooth that wants attention. The box does not open. The city does. We walk toward it carrying our small chores and our stupid offerings and our names like a bowl we can stand to fill.

The Orange Store is a hole with ambition carved out of the wall at the left of the Tunnel. It sells other things—mint and small jars of jam and an enamel kettle in a blue that doesn’t belong to any national flag—but the oranges sit in their crate like monarchs and accept bows from passersby. The owner is a woman named Sela whose hair is a crown of tired and whose habit of turning the price tags upside down makes everyone feel as if they’ve found a mistake and been brave about it. She has a signature in Atlas because every place does. It reads: commerce under permission; community node; goodwill bank. It is a black box with a smile someone forgot to erase at a meeting about frowns.

We tell her what we need without telling her what we need in the way you talk to someone whose daily inventory includes hope. She is not impressed by our Tower. She is impressed by our thermos. She brings out a chipped cup that belonged to her mother and tells us the name of every person who has stood in her doorway and announced a new leaf and then eaten bread with the old mouth. We put sensors where oranges have rolled and we put a chime under the bell that announces arrivals and we put the ribbon in a jar between a jar of star anise and a jar of coins and it looks embarrassed to be in such good company. Felix buys too many things because he is practicing generosity the way boys practice whistling, loud and earnest and frequently off-key.

The Tunnel huffs trucks at us like a large animal practicing patience. People stop and let ritual wash over them and pretend they hate getting wet. Someone says the word tithe and no one shouts. Someone says the word dividend and a teenage girl rolls her eyes in four languages. Gentle Red purls in like a tide. The tooltip accrues verbs like a boy’s pockets accrue marbles and explanations. The city learns to lean into a new balance. Custodian, somewhere, takes notes and sharpens a better knife. Sera takes a second cup of coffee in a room with no windows and decides which tooth to show the next time she smiles.

On the way back through the market we pass my mother’s stall and she does not wave because she is busy saving someone’s life with a kettle and a lie. The moon-wrist girl catches my sleeve and presses a candy into my palm and says, “I held the counter when the sirens started for practice,” and I love her in the way you love a stranger you will write a letter to and never send. The Whale in my office still smiles, I am sure of it. The plant on the stairs will need a new pot and Mona will pretend she liked the old one better while repotting it with a brutality that counts as care. The Tower hushes back into the wind. The Bridge becomes, again, a surface for graffiti that will be painted over by a boy with a good arm and worse taste. Ledger Hall returns our ribbon without asking where we took it because sometimes the city understands that consent can be given retroactively when the motive is a roof.

In my rooms the key taps twice and then hangs quiet, as if the good ghosts are full. The box does not return. The logs do. They scroll in their plainness like a book that thinks itself more boring than it is. risk: deferred; tithe: paused; judicial review: pending; rituals: recognized; Custodian: querying scope. I know the next move belongs to the part of the city that likes its knives straight and its stories thin. I know the part of me that answers to my mother will insist I sleep and the part that answers to the ledger will insist I calculate and the part that answers to the machine will insist I stand on a roof somewhere and teach the wind to write. I know I will stand for Council not because I want to but because my mother will make oolong with the better leaves and call that democracy and because someone is going to have to say out loud in the good room that money is a spell and we should agree what for.

For now I sit. I pour tea. The cup warms and then cools and warms again because I drink slowly and the city moves quickly and we refuse, both of us, to adjust. I write down the names I can remember without help. I write down the places that have agreed to be proofs. I write down the sentence with the glass words and the steel ring and I do not ask the air to answer me. The air moves anyway. The city holds. The numbers hold. The bone under everything holds. And in the space holding makes, a color that would not stay in its lane learns to house itself, which is the only mercy I trust.Chapter 7

The city woke with the wary softness of a person who has just confessed and expects to like the consequences less than the confession. A light rain rehearsed its vowels on the window, not committed enough to call itself weather. I took my tea on the sill because I wanted the street to consider me furniture and not a witness, and because the key tapped the glass with the absent-minded regularity of a person doing sums out loud. The logs had grown new branches in the night while I pretended the box slept; the judicial review had sprouted footnotes with teeth; Custodian’s queries had multiplied like arguments that refuse to be satisfied by one apology. In the market below, my mother’s awning breathed in and out like a lung doing its small ordinary miracle. I could see the corner of the boiled candy tin when she shifted the jars on the shelf and for a second my throat felt too large for my neck, as if an extra word had tried to live there and then thought better of itself.

I dressed in the version of myself I imagined I might be able to defend to a court and to my mother both. Mona had sent me a message sometime between Tower and orange: wear the gray with the shoulders; it gives you a history you don’t have to explain. Felix had sent none in words, and yet I woke with the sound of wind chimes threaded through my hair, which was the sort of intimacy I disapproved of until I needed it. Yash had sent a picture of a ledger page he should not have had in his apartment and a caption that read simply, “Ink remembers different than code,” which was both unhelpful and perfectly aimed.

Underwriting wanted their tutorial. Sera’s calendar had chewed a two-hour window out of the morning and labeled it demonstration with a severity that suggested failure would be a matter of taste. We met in a room whose walls had been overeducated into blandness. The table was the exact color of solutions that take too long to cool. Sera stood, then sat, then stood again, a metronome with a better resume, and cut my greetings into manageable pieces with a look.

“You will show me your house,” she said, as if I had broken into a safe, found a loaf of bread, and had the gall to slice it before she arrived. “You will show me how the rituals bind. You will show me how you intend to keep the color from overrunning everything it thinks is tender. You will not charm me. You will not name anything after me. Begin.”

I arranged the screens like a fan and forced my hands to behave as if the air between them were ordinary. Gentle Red nested at the corners of the map like a shy guest with very firm opinions about seating. Bridge Nine, Ledger Hall, the Stall, the Tower, the Store at the left of the Tunnel—the house had rooms now and doors, and the doors had thresholds that remembered when a person stepped across them and chose to be the sort of person who stepped back. I showed Sera the tags and the witness signatures and the little ridiculous offerings like tame animals allowed to sleep near the hearth. I showed her the way the model’s weights tipped when ritual sat on one side of the scale and Custodian’s hand pressed the other. I showed her the new line in the tooltip at the Tower that made my eyes sting even in retrospect.

She listened with the indulgence of a surgeon watching a capable amateur stitch up a wound in a place where beauty matters less than function. “These are instances,” she said finally, and she said it like someone objecting not to the contents of a bowl but to its capacity. “A house is not a series of respectable guest rooms. A house contains. What happens when a ritual fails. What happens when an offering is refused. What happens when a witness lies. Please do not tell me they never do. The Classifier is worse at forgiveness than we are and it has more memory.”

“They do,” I said, because the time for stories about the city deserving all the gentleness it receives had passed. “Sometimes a boy says he will turn back from heat and then his cousin laughs and then the heat calls itself theater and then the floor learns something it should not be asked to carry. Sometimes a woman accepts a cup of tea and imagines insult at the temperature and throws it and the stall remembers the angle of her arm and repeats it when the wind hits the next day, as if it learned something about how to be rude. Sometimes a witness is paid, in cash or in esteem, and the verb changes its weight. The rituals will be recorded as failed. The offering will be recorded as attempt. The witness will be scored, not for punishment, for adjustment. The model will learn that failure happens and that we do not cut the whole house down when one room burns toast.”

Sera examined that paragraph as if it were an organ she could replace if she decided she did not like its shape. “And the proliferation,” she said, flicking her hand as if shaking a match, “of the color into layers not meant to hold it. Yash Dayal says the underlanguage is humming with coral. He says your hands are on the glass. I can quarantine the center. I cannot convince a river that trickles do not count as water. How do you intend to keep your child from coloring on the walls.”

“By giving it paper,” I said, which was more an act of faith than a method. “By attaching the color to a signature object at each place. The key at the Tower. The ribbon at the Hall. The chieng gong under the bridge. The jar at the Store. If the underlanguage tries to annotate something without the object’s presence, the algorithm will learn to read its own hunger as a kind of error. It will not stop trying. It will stop believing itself. That is the best I can do without cutting it at the throat.”

Sera’s mouth compressed, not in disapproval but in concentration, as if what she wanted to say next had too many consonants. “The Custodian will test your paper by stealing it,” she said at last. “If I were Custodian, I would begin with your mother.”

She did not elaborate. She did not have to. I felt the sentence in my elbows, the way fear of losing something changes the weight of objects you are not currently holding. The room sorted itself around the idea like a flock adjusting to wind. The key in my pocket tapped once, flat, almost offended. I asked if we were done and Sera said we would never be done and stood, which was magnanimous of her. On the way out she touched the Whale pin someone had stuck on the bulletin board near the door—the tie was new, a ridiculous polka dot—and corrected it so it sat straight. “One day,” she said, eyes on the cartoon eye with its cheerful emptiness, “I will stop being the sort of person who cares about this. That will be a bad day. Please prevent it.”

The market had dressed itself in damp and difficulty. My mother had somehow acquired a second kettle without acquiring a second burner and was managing both as if they were quarrelsome twins promised equal inheritance. The moon-wrist girl had a bandage on one forearm that she was trying very hard not to notice. A man with a baby tied to his chest was using the counter as a confessional. My mother looked up when she saw me and then looked down again, a calculation, as if I were a number she did not yet know whether to add to the current sum or subtract. I waited for the pocket of quiet that arrives from time to time in the market like a bird that likes the sound of its own wings and said the thing Sera had put in my mouth.

“They will come for the stall,” I said, and my mother’s spoon did not pause, and this, more than any convincing argument, convinced me I was right. “Not in fire. In a correction. A fine for steam. A new regulation about how many cups you can stack. A complaint that the awning offends a standard that no one has read. They will make paper out of your roof. They will replace it with a roof that belongs to them.”

My mother did not smile and did not perform alarm. She put down the spoon and put her hand flat on the counter as if it were a sick child and she was proving to herself that it had not yet turned feverish. “They already came,” she said, as if we were discussing a rain that had not decided whether to fall. “Early, just after you sent the message that you were going to be more interesting than you were last week. A man with a badge and a pen heavier than his arm. He measured the distance between my burners with a tool that looked like shame in a pocket. He said the air had a quota. I told him the air does not count itself, I do, he did not like it, he left a note anyway. He had a smell like someone who has tried to quit coffee seven times and failed on the seventh. I was going to tell you after you ate. I am not sentimental about roofs. I am tired of replacing them.”

We read the note together. It was as mild as poison in a handsome bottle. It required the installation of a hood like a crown and the purchase of a license that had not existed until the day before. It offered a discount if one applied within twenty-four hours. It was signed Custodian’s legal name for the city’s department that makes sure the air is not rude. The paper had a watermark shaped like a bird that looked like it wanted to land and could not find a branch it trusted. The key in my pocket tapped twice, tired, as if it had expected more subtlety.

I do not like the part of me that enjoys the edge of a fight. I do not trust it. It is the tooth most likely to cut my own tongue. I swallowed the tang and uncapped my pen. “We will apply,” I said. “We will apply late. We will attach a witness signature. We will pay the fine in oranges. We will perform a ritual spelled entirely in forms. We will force the algorithm reading compliance to ingest the same grammar as the rituals it already respects. If the Custodian wants to play house in paper, it can have paper. If it wants to cut the string that holds this roof, it can snip it while the whole city is watching.”

The moon-wrist girl inhaled a yes she did not mean to say out loud. The man with the baby looked relieved, which frightened me more than it pleased me, because relief is a thing you earn with time, not because a stranger opens their mouth. My mother reached under the second shelf, past the jar with the hawthorn and the tin with the good oolong and the envelope where she keeps the receipts she pretends to despise, and brought out a ledger with a cover so old it had stopped being a color and started being a fondness. She opened it to the first page and wrote in a hand that had disciplined three children and a stall and an entire street into a kinder kind of order. Application: witnessed. Payment: offered. Complaint: counted. Ritual: declared. She signed her name and then looked at me as if challenging me to deny the authority of someone who has learned to make law without being invited to the room.

We made a ceremony of the application because paper loves ceremony; we inked it and pressed it and dried it with the tepid wind from the slot between the stall and the wall and the thing that lives behind it. Felix arrived mid-ritual carrying a child of oranges and out of breath the way one gets out of breath when one refuses to run for political reasons. He took one look at the note and did not attempt charm. He stood where a stranger could see him and counted aloud in a voice meant to teach the counting to the counting itself. The stall does not have room for the number of people who made room for it that hour. When we sent the application the screen flickered and Gentle Red bloomed along the bottom edge like a stamp that had been waiting for something to deserve itself.

Sera sent me a single thumbs-up that somehow managed to be both approval and a warning to wipe my fingerprints off the spoon. Custodian did not reply. The market breathed as it always does, in and out, making space for appetite and small griefs, and we went on with the work that is the only argument that ever convinced anyone to put down a match.

In the afternoon the city did what cities do when formal power confuses itself with virtue. It invented a rumor. By four, half the boats on the canal had heard that the Dividend would be paused “for judicial review” and the other half had heard it would be tripled and all of them believed both things in nested layers because belief is a privilege we extend to weather and to money even when they have recently disappointed us. Men on boats pretended their steering had adjectives and performed them; men on shore practiced contempt for men on boats and practiced it with an artlessness so artful it might as well have been funded. By five, the locks between districts had clogged themselves into a consonant you could not pronounce without swearing. The machine lifted its head and tasted smoke and called it data and Gentle Red stuttered like a song with a skipped groove.

We took the bridge because the bridge had already learned our faces and the bridge is a better amplifier than a press release. Mona did not object out loud because she had her hands full convincing a Judge that a protocol that has not executed in a lifetime can wait an hour for a speech in a room with portraits. Yash arrived with three dozen small metal tabs that he had drilled holes in and strung on strings, fierce little coins he explained as if I had asked, designed to clink in a key that Atlas liked. Felix had nothing but breath and nerve and a memory of every name he had called yesterday and every voice that had called him back today.

We did not talk about reassurance because reassurance is a condiment, not a meal. We talked about timing and about oranges and about how dignity is not a line the locks recognize. We hung the tabs and they made a sound like a reasonable argument among people who had decided in advance not to be rude. The men on the boats looked up and then down and then at the boards on their own hulls where they keep small useful lies. The Classifier flagged three hundred transactions as Gentle Red, then twenty as Red, then eight as Black when someone decided to monetize fear in a way that could be sold in the middle of a jam. We counted. We witnessed. We offered. We forced the rumor to walk with us across the span instead of sprinting under it with its feet unseen. Sera had inserted a line into a public feed while no one was watching that read correction posted: tithe deferred; dividend unchanged; please stop practicing future anger and purchase bread. It helped. So did the wind. So did the chimes.

Halfway through the hour, while the canal was learning to breathe with us, the box opened on my terminal without apology and said simply, in a font that managed to be calm without being smug, Custodian has taken a name. It is not as dramatic as you would like it to be. It is a committee of older functions and a handful of hands. It meets in a room with indirect light. It believes in the sanctity of default. It has a chair.

The name sat there with its shoulders like an old street. Hyun-Ju Karr. I knew it the way one knows a song one cannot place, because she had once approved a small grant that had kept the Stall from being classified as a mobile vendor when a mobile vendor was defined as any person inclined to move when they were shouted at. She had a jaw people mistook for principle. She had written a paper in school about the myths we build around accounting and had managed to make romance out of checkmarks. She had been a junior auditor before the Classifier learned to love its own numbers and had been promoted sideways into the kind of job that allows a person to forget how to be spoken to by a crowd. When the box said Custodian had a chair, it meant her back touched the wood.

I did not cheer and I did not curse. I counted down from thirty-four because that is the number of steps from my mother’s stall to the bench where my sister once cried when a woman told her that tea was not currency. I breathed. I texted Sera: sending you a name; you did not get it from me. She replied with a photocopy of someone’s immaculate signature and a request for a cake she would later deny having made. We continued to hold the bridge. The men on boats waved at the chimes as if sound were a dog, and one of the coins drifted down and landed in a child’s lap and she held it with contempt because she had learned to be unimpressed by freebies and then her fingers softened and she listened to its music as if her hands had ears after all.

By dusk, the rumor had eaten itself and fallen asleep like a bored snake. Gentle Red lay over the locks like the faint blush of someone pleased with their own restraint. We took the chimes down and the bridge did not sulk. The Whale in my office sent me a photograph of itself in shadow wearing a black ribbon around its tie, which meant that someone in Aggregates had decided to name the thing that had not happened and forgot the mechanics of how to do that. I laughed and it cost me.

When I reached home, I found Auntie Bae sitting on my stoop as if she had grown there and had all along meant to lift a city with her left hand. She had the ring on her finger and a cane the color of warnings leaned against her knee and the particular patience of someone who has rehearsed the conversation she is about to have and has not practiced the kindness it will require. I sat because her presence made standing rude. She waited because waiting is a ritual too and I was not the only person who had built a house for a color today.

“They asked me,” she said at last, and the pronoun made my teeth cold with the way it encompassed committee and family and a piece of weather with authority. “They asked me whether I would stand with you if you stood. For Council. They made the question sound like a favor. I told them favors are shapes and this one did not yet fit in any box I trusted. Then I asked myself whether I would stand with you anyway. I cannot take both hours. I am old and my knees objected to the Hall. But I can take one. Choose it.”

I had promised my mother, in my head if not in my mouth, that I would say no three times before I said yes. I had rehearsed the nos. I had placed them in my cheek like candy with a bitter center. I realized, sitting with Auntie Bae’s cane like an extra punctuation mark in my field of vision, that the person I had promised to was the person who wanted a daughter to bring tea to the table she had once been kept from and that person would forgive me for skipping to yes if I made the yes an instrument. I did not imagine I would win anything except less bad law. I did not imagine I would like the taste of what I would have to say. I did not imagine much of it at all because imagining is the quickest way to build a mirror and I needed a window.

“Take the hour with the men’s boats,” I said, and heard the way the sentence tried to pretend it did not have a pulse. “Let them stand on the canal and hear you say the words that turned your tongue to silk and steel. The other hour I will stand in the place where a woman once told my sister tea was not currency and I will tell them that it is, because it buys time where numbers do not reach. We will see who calls which hour performance and which confession. We will make our house out of both.”

She nodded, as if I had passed a test that would have comforted no one but her. “I will bring the ring,” she said, tapping the glass with the memory of her finger once being stronger. “I will not put it on your hand. I will put it where the machine can see it and then I will dare it to call me sentimental.”

The box did not open when she left because it is not a friend, it is a tool that has learned the tone that convinces me it is something else. The key tapped the glass three times and then stopped. Across the courtyard someone burned onions. Across the city someone wrote a rule and someone else took the rule away. In the canal, a man who had been afraid all day for a reason he could not name lay down under a deck and listened to the low argument of water and found his breath. An archivist sat in a room that calls itself a vault and returned a strip of paper to a book that had learned to live without it. A lawyer leaned over a draft and replaced the words shall with may and smiled because she had saved someone’s neck without leaving fingerprints. These things counted. They were not in any ledger I could hold, but they leaned the table.

The next morning the Council sent me an invitation that had not been signed by anyone with a name. You are scheduled, it said, as if scheduling counts for consent. The hour was precise and inconvenient. My mother laughed so loudly the stall chimed. She told the moon-wrist girl to bring out the better cups and then told her to put them back because we would break them and that would ruin the ritual. Felix sent a picture of a clean shirt with a stain shaped like Africa and a question mark. Yash sent me a pencil sharpened to an illegal point and a note that said please return with guilt.

Before we could enjoy the theater of asking for permission to be honest in public, Custodian offered a smaller, meaner show. The Stall’s new hood, which we had not installed, appeared installed in the city’s records. It was a sculptural offense. It was a block of chrome the size of an unkindness hung over an image of the stall that someone had drawn to scale with their toe. The algorithm logged the entry as completed. It stamped the ritual performed. It added offering received, which was insulting in a way that felt almost personal. We had been forged.

We did the thing my mother had taught me when I was six and brought a friend home who said my room was too small to play the game she wanted. We made the room bigger with our mouths. We wrote the “installed” hood into being using paper. We drew its shape. We weighed it. We invited a witness and gave her gloves and a stamp. We bought a piece of chrome the size of a principle and placed it on the counter like a trophy we had not won. We took a picture that refused to flatter. We attached the picture to a file that refused to be a lie. We labeled the picture not yet and signed it with the ring. Gentle Red fluttered, offended and charmed. The model took the correction, colored, and held. The Custodian’s line that had sought to turn ritual into inventory flickered and failed to take root. Sera sent me a private message that said I have hidden joy in a file called cost. Do not make me show it to anyone.

At the Council, the chairs had the insufficiency of expensive furniture. The dais was a second-story window that forgot it had once been built for people to stand at and look down at a street when they were both wrong and right. The chamber smelled like decisions reheated too many times. When they said my name, they did not say it wrong. They did not say it like a prayer. They said it like a test. I spoke. I said the things you say when you are trying to convince people who like their numbers unambiguous that ambiguity is sometimes a tax you pay to keep a city alive. I told them that we could not afford a tithe executed in anger and that we could not afford to teach a machine that hesitation is shameful. I told them that men were rich and that our bargain had bought a half-life for harm and that this half-life could be extended with the sort of work that looks like prayer because it is, in fact, labor. I told them oranges are money and tea is money and a witness signature has more currency than a shout.

They asked dull cunning questions about scope and about supervision and about whether ritual would become fiat if we fed it fast enough. They asked me to promise Gentle Red would stay where it was put. They asked me to forgive them for hating improvisation and to hate them back for liking default. I answered as if I had a mother listening because I did. When the hour finished, the men on boats had begun to gather on the canal, and Auntie Bae had already taken off her shoes. She stood with her feet bare on the deck of a barge like a goddess who had decided to make herself smaller so that the city could bear to look at her. She did not speak softly. She did not shout either. She spoke with the accuracy of someone who long ago learned the cost of being misquoted by both machines and men. She said protect mankind with the anger of a person who has been living with those words long enough to have grown a second jaw. She said use your mind with a tenderness that made the barges shiver in their ropes. She said cut us if you must but count first and you will find your knife looking for better work. The men on the water did not clap. They did not perform gratitude. They stood. They lifted their hands as if balancing something that could break. The Classifier put its hand on its own mouth and remembered to be cautious.

We began to discover the edge cases that would be statutes later and jokes sooner. A man with a pocket full of firecrackers purchased a bouquet of lilies to make a widow’s day rowdy, and Gentle Red flashed and then steadied and then asked for an offering and the offering was a promise to stop buying firecrackers for a week and we had to decide whether promises count before they are kept. A girl who had never swung a hammer wrote a poem about bridges and got paid for it and the algorithm struggled to categorize her earnings with that old misogyny of systems that distrust what they cannot use to lift boxes. We made a ritual of reading the poem aloud under the bridge and paying her in coins that turned to oranges on the other side. It was silly. It worked.

Custodian changed its tactics from cuts to whispers. Hyun-Ju Karr began to appear in rooms with her hair pinned like a stern lecture and ask the sort of questions that forced people to reveal their unkindness to themselves. She asked policers of air whether they thought steam was an insult. She asked men on boats whether they believed they owed the city more than what they already paid with their calm. She asked archivists whether they were keeping everything worth keeping and who told them it was. She asked me whether I thought I was building a religion and I told her I was trying to prevent the most pious parts of the machine from strangling the rest. She smiled with half her mouth and said that was an answer she could write down and then left me a note that said in another life I would have liked you less. It was a compliment. It was also a threat.

At night I counted the things we had not lost and tried to measure their absence. The tithe still slept. The Gentle Red still housed itself. The Tower still hummed like a throat not yet cleared for a speech. The stall’s hood still did not exist, which is not the same as victory, it is only refusal with proof. The Whale still smiled as if smiling were its only job and perhaps it was. The city remembered not to set itself on fire out of boredom. The box did not open for days and this was either courtesy or a sulk. My mother began to remind customers, especially the ones who wore apology like perfume, to tip in small coins that made good noise and not credit. She said it was better for the model and worse for the tax man and that is what we have always meant by balance.

When the box did open, it did not bother with introductions or with asking whether I was tired. It said simply, as if announcing weather, there is a hole in your house and it is shaped like morning. Men are waking, it wrote, their Good Sleep dosed without drama, their harmlessness at steady state. And yet in the hour between tea and errands, the system is seeing a rise in flags not undercut by ritual. The color is gentling in the afternoon. It is biting, briefly, around the time the city adjusts its belt. It is not Custodian. It is the place where the proof stops because you have not built that room.

I dressed because I do not know how to answer a letter like that in my pajamas. The streets were still damp, as if the city had taken its time forgiving the night. I took the canal as far as the point where the water begins to think it is an argument and turned left toward a neighborhood that had never felt the city owed it anything. The morning hole was a run of streets where deliveries and prayers share curb space and offices pretend they are not homes and homes pretend they are not offices because both of them are so tired they will call anything bed if it allows their head to touch something that does not immediately demand to be washed. The flags were clustering around Shifts, around the hour when people who are making bread for others think about whether to eat their own and decide they will have a plum instead because salt is a more honest breakfast. The model was reading hunger and naming it danger. It was not wrong. It was not right enough.

We built the room with what we had. Felix created a breakfast from oranges and tapping coins and the sorts of jam Sela pretends she does not overprice. Yash brought coffee without asking and tea without warning and the ribbon without confessing. Mona sent us forms and then apologized for it in a tone that made me want to fill them out correctly to spite her. We set a table at a corner that has always been a table even when the city pretended it was a corner. We wrote a small liturgy that asked people to state out loud the thing they were about to do and then to ask for something small afterward that made it possible to live with the doing. I will go to my second job and I will take a hot roll. I will clean a lobby and I will have my name said to me with care. I will buy firecrackers and I will hand my neighbor my list so she can take the fuse and replace it with string. The Classifier blinked, as if the word breakfast had lessons it had missed. Gentle Red learned a new hinge. The hole in the house filled with steam.

It could not last, not as a performative. It had to be taught to the places that live through morning, the doors that swing on the hour between eight and nine and call it exercise, the buses that pretend they are not confessions. We left behind, in each, some ridiculous token the machine would be embarrassed to admit it loved—a teaspoon bent the way my mother bends spoons to keep them from wandering, a coin that had learned to clink in a more persuasive register, a ribbon with a crease we had not ironed out on purpose so the Classifier would learn to forgive that fold. We lost some of them to theft because theft is a ritual too and we learned to write the loss in as a sign that the house was being lived in.

That afternoon, I told my mother I would stand. I told her I did not want to; I told her I did; I told her I would regret it; I told her I would regret not doing it more. She made a sound between a laugh and a sigh and pushed a cup into my hand as if I were a person who could be helped by liquid and sugar. She told me that if I did not tell the truth, my hair would fall out even though it was tied up so neatly, and if I did tell the truth, men would bring me oranges and I would have to pretend to like them more than tea. She told me to ask Auntie Bae to fix my collar because she had always understood how to lay cloth where it could persuade a room. She told me that if I let the Council think they could own the rituals, she would send my sisters to stand outside their houses and argue with their windows until the windows gave up.

At night, the canal knitted itself back together and then unraveled in the middle because a boy in a green coat decided to test the water with his foot and then his knee and then forgot he was a person and thought he was a stone. Gentle Red flashed, then paused, then waited, disciplined by a week of being taught that hesitate is a verb that saves lives. A woman in a blue coat who had once caught a child at the Tower caught a boy at the canal and then laughed with her mouth closed because she was embarrassed to be brave. We counted. We witnessed. We offered. The machine took notes with a tenderness that embarrassed me, and for the hundredth time in as many hours I believed that mercy is a technology we have not yet named with enough seriousness.

It was not until the third day after the hole that the box gave me something I had not asked for. It said: there is a color that wants to exist and is waiting for you to notice it is not a warning. It is the color of refusal without injury. It is the color of a door that has been knocked on and not opened and no one has kicked it down. It is the color of men on boats shaking their heads and saying no politely and being believed. It has been hiding in the edges of Gentle Red like an adjective that did not yet find its noun. If you do not name it, Custodian will.

I did not want another color. The house I had built could barely contain the one I had coaxed into eating at a table. I did not want to teach a new grammar to a city that was already learning to pretend it had been speaking this dialect its whole life. I did not want to give Custodian a new handle. I did not want the job and I wanted it so much I could feel my back asking me to sit. I sent a note to Sera that said simply suddenly I am a decorator, and she replied with a line that made me like her more than I should: decorate it before they name it austerity.

We took the stoop with the blue tile because refusals require small audiences. The boy with the dog was there again, reading a chapter about stock and its obligation to keep its temper. He had grown two inches of patience since the last time I looked. We put a chime on the railing that hates chimes. We placed an orange in the dog’s mouth to keep him from arguing with our theology. We asked three people to say no in public in ways that would ordinarily have led to bruises later. A woman refused a loan she knew she could not pay back without selling her coat. A man told a man that he did not have to understand why he was afraid, he only had to keep his hands to himself. A child told a woman that she would not smile today and that this did not mean she disliked her. We counted. We witnessed. We offered. The color that arrived was not coral. It refused coral gently. It was a gray that had forgiven scolding and learned to be kind to itself. It was a shade I recognized in my mother’s hair.

We did not name it aloud. We sent it through the system with a temporary code and watched it build a small room in the house and put a chair by the window and sit. Custodian would have called it compliance. We called it courtesy and that was not a joke. Sera would later argue to a room that prefers line items that the city has always understood the difference between a closed door and a door that has been slammed, and that our great mistake had been to teach the Classifier those were the same. That argument would not win us a budget. It would win us an afternoon. Most days, that is the measure.

We are not done. We might never be. The judicial review is a mouth that insists on chewing. The tithe is a knife that has remembered it has a sheath and looks at it with suspicion. The house needs a roof that can be taken off and put on easily because weather is fickle and the city refuses to be bored. The Whale in my office has learned to wear small pins that people bring to it as if it were a statue with a hagiography, and I do not know whether to find this charming or frightening or both. My mother’s stall has a hood drawn badly on paper and none in the air. The moon-wrist girl has taught herself to say no to men who think their coins buy her wrists and has not yet learned how to say yes to the ones who think their apologies do. Felix has started a notebook not of wind chime keys but of doors that will open to someone who says please. Yash has acquired a plant that refuses to be repotted and is threatening to retire over it, which is his way of saying he will keep working forever.

Tonight, when I count the things that did not happen because we asked them not to with more ceremony than nerves and more stubbornness than grace, the list will be a ribbon I cannot fold back into its box. I will sit with it anyway. I will drink tea and pretend that my open mouth is not a sermon. I will polish the key with the corner of a towel. I will write down the names I have not yet bothered to learn to pronunciation of, because the Classifier is better at names than I am and that is a shame I can fix. I will ask the air for nothing. It will move anyway. The city will hold. The numbers will whisper. The bones will argue with the flesh and then agree, for an hour at least, that neither can stand without the other and both would like a seat.Chapter 9

The morning carried a bruise along its edge, the kind that doesn’t show until you bump it twice. I woke with the feeling something had used my ribs as a counting frame in the night and left a number there that refused to divide. The logs had new teeth. Judicial review had sprouted a schedule in a tone that suggested it admired itself. Custodian’s queries proliferated like mushrooms in a wet cupboard. And in my pocket, the key tapped an impatient three as if the day had a head start I wasn’t respecting.

I had promised too many people too many versions of myself before noon. Sera wanted a list of failure states with their mouths sewn shut. Mona wanted a campaign speech that sounded like I was refusing to campaign. Yash wanted me to admit that the ribbon had become a superstition and therefore belonged to History, which is another way of saying it should be blessed with paperwork. My mother wanted me to sit, breathe, and eat a bun with the dignity of a person whose insides were not learning percussion. The city wanted proof that the house we had built for a color would hold when the weather turned personal.

We went first to the hour we had taught to be kinder. The corner where morning stops pretending it doesn’t need ritual had acquired a name without asking our permission; people called it the Shift Table as if it had always been there, the way people call a scar a story once it stops hurting. The stools had memorized three dozen backs. The air had learned to condense into insistence and then diffuse into civility. We had left absurd anchors to remind the underlanguage that reality is sometimes ridiculous: a bent teaspoon, a coin that had learned to clink in a better register, the corner of the ribbon with the crease we refused to iron out. Gentle Red pulsed along the bottom of a half-dozen receipts. The gray of Refusal Without Injury—I had not named it aloud, but Sera had called it courtesy in a report that smelled faintly of ink and contempt—fell like polite weather along three conversations that might otherwise have practiced becoming fights.

The bruise announced itself at 8:43, because harm likes to be punctual. A van with a logo that promised bread like weather should be—daily, honest, cheap—rolled, too fast, into the narrow of the market. The driver was a Dividend man I knew by none of the names on his paperwork and all of the ways his shoulders apologized to rooms. He had a tag history like a hymn: Gentle Red for accelerants bought to clean griddles, for a bundle of rope used to tie a canopy better against wind, for a late-night purchase of a dozen lilies in a district that thinks flowers can be bribed into liking it. The model held him like a tame fire; risk flag, predicted harmless, offering received. He had made a ritual of leaving a bag of ends and heels where hands could find them without admitting hunger. He had never once asked for thanks out loud.

He had not slept. You could see it in the way the van took the corner like a man who had borrowed steadiness and was prepared to return it in eight pieces. The Good Sleep dose, the one everyone pretends is a spice added to men’s tea and not a law written in their throats, had been missed or mismeasured or counterfeited. Later, when we went looking for fault like breadcrumbs, we would find a batch of ampoules with serial numbers a digit off from any legitimate list, the kind of forgery that passes until someone falls. In the moment, we had only the sound of metal trying to forget it had a job, and the van’s undercarriage becoming a punctuation mark, and the snap of wood when it meets the geometry it did not plan for.

The moon-wrist girl had a tray of oolong at shoulder height and a smile she did not yet distrust. The tray went up; the body went back; the van kissed the corner of the stall like a cousin who didn’t know the custom and overdid it; the hood-that-did-not-exist fluttered on paper as if it were pleased to have been thought of; the girl went down with an arm tucked under her like a note scribbled too quickly. The kettle didn’t fall. My mother always puts the kettle in the center of the universe and gravity obeys. The tray bent into a shape we will see for months in the way the light hits our counters. The van stopped, finally remembering that sometimes halt is the only verb available.

The sound of harm in public is not a scream. It is a change in the way people agree to stand. The Classifier flashed red in a way that had nothing to do with coral and everything to do with blood and law. The tooltip lagged a quarter second behind reality, suggestions piling in its throat until they became orders: risk of harm: realized; predicted harmless outcome: contradicted; witness required; offering insufficient; seek adjudication. The stall smelled like tea and fear and a bright, bitter metal I will call regret because I don’t want to name the other thing.

We did the incorrect thing first. We shouted. This is always the incorrect thing, even when it feels like a command carved into bone. Felix was already at the van door. He pulled the handle with his hands and with his registry both because the system will open for men faster when the world is burning and we built it that way and we will either fix it or spend the rest of our lives apologizing. The driver’s face wore a decade. His eyes were bowls with the soup gone. He said sorry three times as if it were a coin that, if rubbed, might turn into a key. He did not run because men do not run in our city unless they are practicing for praise or necessary loss. He did not lie because he is not allowed to. He said, “I thought—” and then he was done because thought had not been invited to this corner.

The moon-wrist girl did what people who belong to places do. She sat up. She looked at her arm as if it belonged to someone she would choose to love anyway. She said, “Don’t scold,” to my mother, as if the story in this room might choose a gentler tense. My mother did not scold. She took the bandage off with a precision that reminds me why tea is surgery when performed properly. She said, “You are allowed to faint later. We will schedule it.”

The model does not schedule fainting. It schedules policy. Red propagated through the Omnibus with a speed that makes you want to give machines new verbs. Deposits hung like held breath. A dozen Gentle Reds became brittle, then dark, then nothing. The judicial review spit out a bracketed sentence that made my teeth ache: interim recommendation: suspend gentle overlays pending clarification of contradiction handling. Sera’s window popped a small inhale in the corner of my screen and said, in letters that were trying not to be frantic, I can hold them for one hour. Show me a place. Show me a practice. Show me how you keep this from becoming a reason to kill a color.

This is what we had not built into the house. We had wanted to believe that failure could be folded into the lintel and the threshold and the bell without being given its own room. That was laziness disguised as optimism. Harm requires a ledger. Not to count blame—we have always had more blame than we know what to do with—but to count the weight that must be carried to keep the floor from sagging under what we pretend is light.

The voice did not open a box like a miracle. It did something worse and more honest: it arrived in a sentence I had already written in a margin and forgotten. Protect mankind, it had said once. Use your mind. Now it added, in a tired hand I recognized as my own when I have not slept, Damage must settle where it belongs or it will hunt for a weaker table. Prefigure a sorrow ledger. Bind it to repair. Bind it to names. Bind it to hours, not coins alone.

“Sorrow ledger,” I said aloud in a room that was trying on silence for size, and my mother, who does not indulge theology until it pays rent, nodded sharply as if recognizing an old acquaintance who owed her money. “We will do it at the Embankment Steps,” she said, before I could suggest the Hall or the Bridge or some other place too proud to let grief live there. “People already go there to decide whether to keep walking. We will give them a reason to turn and face the street instead.”

We moved the way people move when a room has decided to open to weather. Mona was there because she is always there where consent is going to be rewritten and needs a witness. Yash had a stack of forms so blank they were practically prayers. Felix had oranges not because oranges fix anything but because he has learned that a gift small enough to be refused and then accepted later teaches the machine more patience than any speech. The driver came, because he was not allowed to be absent from his own ledger, and because the city would not forgive it if he tried. The moon-wrist girl came with her arm in a sling and a mouth that had found a straight line and needed to test it on air. The Steps were wet with the morning and with decades of people who pretended to watch water and were in fact watching themselves.

We did not call it confession because confession implies a priest and a door and a forgiveness rationed like flour. We called it Accounting for After because nothing is more offensive to harm than being denied the last word. We set the ribbon on the third step because that is where the marble drops in a way that remembers weight. We set the chimes under the rail because sorrow hates being startled into flight. We placed a jar that had once held star anise and now would hold promises like a currency we could spend without the exchange rate humiliating anyone.

Mona read the terms because her voice can convince a contract it was its idea to be reasonable. The ledger of repair would record who was hurt, how, by what line. The driver’s name. The stall’s name. The girl’s name. The city’s name, because the city owns the corners we call inevitable and it should be on the hook when inevitable happens. The ledger would record what is owed. Not just coin. Time. Carrying. Work that cannot be done by proxy. Witnessing that cannot be farmed out to men who like to be seen doing penance. The ledger would record what is offered and what is accepted and it would record the refusal if refusal was the right answer. It would bind the model so that when harm contradicted a gentle prediction, the answer would not be to abandon gentleness, but to add weight to the repair line until it bowed the scale back into balance.

This was not pretty. That is how we knew it might work. The driver said his names like stairs. He said the coin first because he is a man and we trained men to think money saves time. He said his hours next because he had never had any to spare and it made his mouth ungenerous. He said he would rebuild the corner of the stall with his hands, and my mother did not say whose hands she trusted more with her wood, she said, “We will make you apprentice to someone who knows how to be careful where you do not.” He said he would deliver bread for nothing for a month and the girl said, “No,” and it was not polite and it was correct, because she has learned already that refusing a man’s hunger to be forgiven is sometimes the only way to keep him from starving someone else.

We wrote it all down. We did not use the clean paper Yash had brought first; we used a page that had got damp in the morning and dried into a map of a river. The Classifier resisted, the way muscles resist the addition of a new task; it wanted to flip a switch that said: misprediction means do not trust again. We did not let it. We bound the repair line to the same anchors we had used for the house: place; witness; offering. We added a new anchor it could not argue with because it understands counts better than vows: hours. Two a day for a month. Because repair is not a single tearful public moment; it is boredom performed accurately. We attached the ledger to the driver’s registry not as punishment but as work. We attached it to the stall’s signature as a claim on future gentleness when gentleness is not fashionable. We attached it to the girl’s wrists not with a weight but with a right to refuse to turn what she suffered into anyone’s grace.

Atlas shuddered. It is not built to love boredom or to understand that small carrying is the only thing large carrying knows how to be made of. The tooltip scribed a new seam in its body, hesitant, as if writing the word might ruin its pretty mouth: risk realized; prediction contradicted; repair ledger opened; hours bound; offering accepted; gentleness preserved; penalty applied to prediction weights until ledger fulfilled. It looked absurd, like law learning to write a love letter. It looked right, like someone putting away a knife and reaching for pliers.

The hour Sera had promised me lifted its head like a guard dog deciding whether to bite the wrong person. Underwriting’s feed went from feral to fascinated. Sera sent three words—hold; holding; held—and then, after a beat, the thing closest to affection such a person can afford: never do this to me again without warning. Custodian sent nothing, which is a kind of applause. Hyun-Ju Karr appeared like the smell of ink at my shoulder and watched us fill out the row of a table that had not existed the day before with a concentration that told me she had once wanted to be an archivist until a teacher accused her of liking dust too much and she had pretended to believe them.

“We will need a budget line for this,” she said finally, as if speaking to the part of the Steps that responds to money, which is to say the part that leaks in winter. “A reserve to fund the hours when coin cannot stand in for time. A framework to prevent men from turning boredom into theatre. A ceiling, because ceilings are the only way to teach people how to be tall and not ridiculous.”

“You’re going to save my job,” Sera said on the line in a tone that suggested she might dislike me for a week less than she had planned. “Or ruin it thoroughly. I approve of either outcome if it buys me another morning with fewer knives.”

The stall closed for an hour in the afternoon, not because we were asked to by anyone with a badge, but because we needed to relocate a corner to its proper coordinates in our minds. The moon-wrist girl ate bread without apologizing. The driver held a broom with a sincerity that made me forgive him for knowing how to perform contrition. My mother stood with her hands on her hips like a general who has learned that the best discipline is wrappers of candy and threats saved for later. Felix cut the wind chime keys from lengths of string with his teeth because he had forgotten his knife, and Yash called three different departments to inform them that a sorrow ledger now existed in the city and that they were welcome to send paper and not personnel.

In the evening, when the light does its trick where it learns to be clean by pretending to be water, I went to the Tower because I did not like the idea of a house with a new room and no gossip told to the roof. The wind had its old opinions. The trust anchor purred like a cat that had decided not to scratch me today. The box did not open. Instead, the metal gave back a human sound—the thud of someone running up stairs and then thinking better of the last ten hard ones. Hyun-Ju Karr emerged, hair pulled back with an economy that made my knuckles itch to ruin it, and stood where a person becomes a silhouette too easily. We did not greet each other like enemies. We did not greet each other like friends. We performed the ritual of two people who might share a job later and are practicing not to flinch.

“You built a ledger for harm,” she said, as if this were either shocking or inevitable. “Be careful it does not become an altar. People like to light candles and call that paying.”

“They will,” I said, because the first lie we tell to power is always that people won’t do the thing we would do if no one were watching. “We will tie it to hours. We will make it boring. We will make it heavy. We will make it contain the only magic I trust: repetition.”

“And the Council,” she said, mouth curving as if she had bitten a fruit that was better than it looked. “You will stand. They will try to make you choose between colors. They will try to make you promise to lift the dividend or cut it or salt it with shame. You will tell them about hours and they will yawn.”

“I will bring a bench,” I said. “I will make them sit while I talk. I will make them tired. Sometimes tired is the only way to teach patience.”

She smiled with her eyes and not her mouth, which is the only smile I accept as sincere in rooms like this. “I have spent a decade teaching patience to algorithms by threatening them with auditors,” she said, and in the moment I liked her more than was wise. “Bring me a motion that funds repair hours. Bring me a mechanism that keeps men from gaming boredom. Bring me a bar chart that makes ugly people applaud. I will carry it until the bones in my hands ask for new names.”

“People will say we are building religion,” I said, because I needed to hear her answer so I could make it mine if she said it better.

“We are building infrastructure,” she said. “The city will add incense. That’s their business.”

We left the Tower with the shared disgust of people who can’t talk about beauty without wanting to fix a pipe. On the way down my terminal breathed in my pocket and for once I did not resent it. The box had not opened because it did not need to. The underlanguage had learned a phrase without me pushing it, and that should have frightened me and did. The phrase was small, almost fussy: after-accounting initiated; prediction penalty applied; gentleness preserved by repair. It would be mocked by people who had never swept a floor twice because it needed it. It would be loved by people who had.

At the stall, the hood still did not exist in air, which remains the only space I honor. The moon-wrist girl had learned to pour with her left hand as if she had always meant to. The driver had found the rhythm a broom loves, which is the rhythm of apologies well made. My mother had re-labeled the jar with the better oolong in a code that had fooled me the first time I learned it and would not now, which is how she pays me the respect of not thinking I am done growing.

Felix came to me with a notebook that had been a wind chime patch until the world decided it wanted him to write instead. He had a list of names long enough to make the machine choke. “Men who will carry,” he said, as if he were offering me a remedy for an illness neither of us could name yet. “Hours, not coin. They keep asking if they can buy extra and I’m telling them no. They look at me like I’m robbing them. I’m not. I’m making them rich in the only way that buys back the mess we make.”

He has a way of saying something earnest enough to set my teeth on edge and then making me forgive him by being right in a way that leaves no scar. I took the list and did not let him see my mouth because I did not want him to think I was approving the man he was trying to be. “We will make them apprentices,” I said. “Not to virtue. To tasks. To patience. To a stall that has never once in its life forgiven anyone for boiling water badly.”

At night, I slept with my shoes by the door because the city has been asking me to be quick, and the only way to make quick not ruin the rest is to respect its ceremonies. The logs climbed and fell with the tide of foolishness our streets always practice after dark. Gentle Red had cut its own wrists and learned how to bandage them back with ritual. The gray of courtesy had found the corners it liked and asked for no budget. The sorrow ledger had acquired five entries and a quiet arrogance. The tithe still slept and would wake with worse teeth if we did not keep feeding it patience. The Whale sent me a picture of itself wearing a small black ribbon attached upside down, and my office smelled like the kind of laughter you only allow yourself when the alternative is weeping into a file.

In the morning, the market’s bruise looked like memory and not promise. The driver came early to sweep. He didn’t look at me when I arrived and that was a kindness. The moon-wrist girl nodded to me with the sort of solemnity children deploy when they have decided to be older until they have earned the right to stop. My mother poured a cup and did not ask me whether the Council would listen; her face held the mathematics of a person who has seen a room refuse to move and has learned inventiveness from that insult. She pressed a boiled candy into my hand as if it were a stamp. “Count,” she said. “Witness. Offer. You know the ritual. If they make you pray, pray to their chairs.”

I went. The Council chamber was stocked with portraits ready to practice patience and men with haircuts ready to practice impatience. Auntie Bae was waiting with her ring and her cane and the particular tired joy of someone who has decided to use up the rest of her days doing things she will like remembering. Sera sat in a row that pretends it is not a bench, holding a pen like a promise. Hyun-Ju took a seat with a view of my mouth. Felix did not sit because he is not made to perform obedience in rooms like this unless it will save a life. Yash was in the corner stacking paper into a sort of tower that would embarrass a child and shame a clerk.

I did not speak about colors. I spoke about hours. I spoke about the insult of making boredom so expensive that only the poor can afford it. I spoke about repair as a currency the city must mint and force into circulation, not as mercy but as math. I spoke about a house we had built for a color and a ledger we had built for harm, and a tower that had learned to deny an override because a witness had placed her hand on metal, and a stall that had refused to let its hood exist in any world where it could not smell tea. I spoke about men and apologies and names and the way the city will choke on its own virtue if it doesn’t learn to chew. I spoke until my voice remembered it is bone and stopped being frightened of rooms that pay too much for chairs.

They asked the questions they had to ask to look like the people their portraits believed them to be. They asked about abuse and about scaling and about whether we could afford to lengthen mercy when our budgets were already made mostly of string. They asked if we were deifying accidents. They asked if we were inventing a religion. They asked if we could make people be good. I told them no, and then I told them the version of yes that makes reform possible: we can make it easier to be good than to be praised for pretending. We can make it cost less to repair than to burn it down and start over. We can measure the refusal to harm as something other than emptiness. We can count the hours that turn apology into habit. We can anchor it to place so hard that when your favorite custodian lifts a knife anywhere near the trust anchor, it cuts their own argument instead of ours.

They did not applaud. They adjourned. That is the sort of mercy we have trained them to. Outside, the canal had learned a new way to hold light and intended to keep it until someone more persuasive came along. Men on boats practiced wave and no with the dignity of people who have finally learned those are verbs worth teaching your children. The Shift Table steamed. The Steps remembered the weight we had placed on the third stone and did not complain. The Whale did not smile; someone had turned it to face the wall, a prank or a kindness depending on your religious affiliations, and I let it learn humility for an hour.

On my way to the stall, a woman with a hooded jacket and a pen that had eaten three other pens for breakfast stepped into my stride and said my name as if she were asking me to justify it. She had the look of a reporter who knows her editors like blood better than meaning. I did not lie to her. I told her we were teaching machines to handle contradiction without reaching for knives. I told her men were still rich and that this was not a spell to make them poor; it was a spell to make that richness carry weight. I told her we were building a ledger of harm that did not collapse into punishment and a house for a color that did not collapse into worship. She asked me whether I believed we could prevent a tithe if we taught it to hesitate. I told her I believed we could make it ask better questions. That is the only way to survive a tithe anyway.

When I reached the stall, the driver was finishing his hours for the day and my mother was practicing the ritual of not fighting the past with a spoon. The moon-wrist girl had braided her hair like a page of script we will spend a week decoding. Felix put an orange in the jar with star anise and pretended he had not meant to and blushed when the orange refused to sink. Yash had stolen back the ribbon and then replaced it and then stole it again because archivists are theatrical and do not think doors are theater enough. We had not fixed anything. Nothing stays fixed in a city. We had built rooms for our mess and given them windows. We had attached our vows to counters and rails and steps and named them in a grammar the machine could digest without blasphemy. We had given harm a ledger and refused to let it eat the house.

The key tapped my pocket one, two, three, and I knew I would never count again without hearing metal against glass. The box did not open because it had nothing new to tell me that the day hadn’t already said with its mouth full. I poured tea. It tasted like a place that had decided to keep us if we kept our side of the bargain. The numbers breathed. The bone under everything held. We had given contradiction a chair and taught it to sit. We would have to teach it again tomorrow. I am very good at counting. I am learning to be better at repeating.
