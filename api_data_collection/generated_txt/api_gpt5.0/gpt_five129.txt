The freezer hummed with the constancy of a distant tide. Catherine liked that. The reliable sound, the way the cold blue light bled beneath the door and washed the concrete floor. Portent at her ankles. It was a true light, unfiltered, unlike the lime-drenched fluorescence of the studio at noon or the jaundiced stairs that descended to this flat-space basement, where no one ever came.

She worked in the studio first. Always the painting before the cold. Always the color before the consolation. Flat brushes and hog bristle fans. A battered tin of pigment, the labels scumbled by her hands—cerulean, Naples yellow, Payne’s grey—each cap threaded with a little seam of dried paint, like scar tissue. The canvas on the easel made a sound when she touched it: papery, eager. Her knuckles were a field of half-moons.

Today’s subject wore blue. Catherine filled the space before outlines with a fog of ultramarine and titanium white and let the blue seep to the edges. A nurse’s uniform. She knew the weight of the cloth, the exact crinkle of disposable gloves when they were slipped from fingers, the seams at the shoulder. Her brush went there. She invented the gentle stoop created by hours leaning over frail ribs. The tired smile. She moved the paint like she was smoothing a blanket.

The hands came last. Always last. Catherine painted hands as if someone might look into them and see exactly what a person carried. She lightened the knuckle, lifted the tendon, let the vein bloom like a river under ice. Layer upon layer. Emphasized the index finger, because it pointed, because it must lead.

Elsewhere, there were screens. Screens that felt like crowds. Places where she had been told she was ugly, false, a monster, until she believed each syllable like a prayer. Places where she wrote back until her fingers ached. The impulse to re-arrange the world with language was not that different from the impulse to arrange pigment until it behaved. She had learned how to herd strangers, to make an algorithm dance. She learned what kind of signal harmed, what kind wounded, and where to aim so that it drew blood you could not see.

She also learned names. And times. The schedules of those who recorded their lives with care. They made themselves known and she took note. She did not take without purpose. If people had to be accused of something, they should be accused of their own season of carelessness.

The freezer hummed. Catherine reached for the cloth she kept draped over the rope handle and tied it to her wrist. Her hands weren’t large but they were strong, nimble, and perhaps that had been the first clue: when you learn the shape of a hand, it teaches you something back. The light made a halo beneath the door. She liked that, too.

The basement smelled like pine detergent and salt. She kept that smell on purpose. Memory should have an odor that helps it obey. She tugged. The seal gave with a sigh. The blue light spilled upwards, reaching for the joists. Cold stuttered into the room.

Catherine looked down. She did not look long. She did not indulge. It would be disrespectful to stare, when she had already asked so much of them. Four wrapped shapes, separated by waxed paper, as if each were a parcel headed by mail to an estranged relative. Their names written on tape. Inked very neatly. Not their given names, which would be unkind in this place, but the names she chose for paintings, which was the nearest thing she had to prayer.

“Blue Shift,” she said, and the words flickered on the meat of the air and died.

She closed the lid, the rope handle going slack in her hand. The hum resumed. The world above her creaked, the house quieting, or preparing. She washed her hands again in the big utility sink. She could tell what time it was from her fingernails, the way the polish at the edges dulled by dusk. Almost. Not yet.

Her phone lit the workbench. It vibrated politely as if knocking. Catherine touched it, and the forum came alive like a hive. Anonymous faces with names that fluttered and vanished. Some were hers. Most were shadows—people as hungry for extraction as she was. She felt the familiar swell of something she wouldn’t name: not anger (too hot), not grief (too soft), but a direction. People were wrong about the world, and the wrongness was a disease. She had been infected by it in her childhood and had learned to live with a low fever for years.

There was a nurse on today’s feed. A clip taken in the staff break room at St. Danae’s, a private hospital with uniforms the color of bright sky. The nurse did not know she was being filmed, but she was careful anyway; that’s what nurses are. Catherine watched the nurse adjust a sweater over her shoulders, watched her bring a spoon to someone’s lips. There was kindness there. The mist on her glasses when she laughed. Catherine almost culled it, moved on, spared it. But governance requires symmetry, and Catherine liked her rules. The world had not obeyed rules when it should. She would.

She wrote, and it was like sliding a brush into a pot of ink. She recommended a particular thread. She set a clock ticking. She sent a message.

Her fingers ached again, just slightly. She pressed the pads into her palms and imagined them sinking prints into the soap at the sink. Above her, the studio waited, damp with varnish and the breath of paint. She went up to finish the hands.

When she painted, she did not think of the freezer. She thought of accuracy and light.

She had a show in a month. She imagined the gallery’s white walls and the way the track lights would break the canvas into a field of opened mouths that were not mouths at all, just shades. She imagined them being misunderstood. She smiled a small, secret smile and added one last stroke to the ring finger—the finger of promise, though promises meant very little when you knew where they ended up.

—

On the other side of the city, in a long, simple church that shouldered up against a thrift store and a barber with his pole forever turning, Detective Geist was not detective. She wore the same black she had worn in another life, except that now the collar was white, a small square of plowed field at her throat.

The sun laid a hand on the boards of the nave. Someone had polished them. The organ breathed and stilled. The air smelled of lilies and coffee. Geist—Eva to those who loved her, Geist to those who used to hate her and had not learned how to stop—stood at the door where she could take hands as they left and say good morning, and mean it.

Her hair was pulled back. She had learned that if she wore it loose, certain parishioners had trouble hearing what she said. The cross on the wall leaned slightly left. She had asked the warden to fix it twice, and both times it leaned left again. She thought of leaving it, as a way to give in.

“Good morning, Vicar,” said Mrs. Daly, who wore pearls to the grocery store and never took a bulletin past the first page.

“You sang beautifully today,” Geist said, and it was not a lie. “How is Margaret?”

Mrs. Daly rolled her eyes at heaven. “Stubborn. She’s trapped at St. Danae’s because they don’t trust the lifts. And the nurses—oh, they’re sweet enough, but—”

“They are doing their best,” Geist said gently.

“Well, I hope it’s good enough. You were a detective before, weren’t you?” Mrs. Daly asked, like a cat who had finally found a loose thread to pull.

“Before I learned to love clergy budgets and water heaters, yes.”

“You must have seen some things.”

“Some,” Geist said, and then, because she had adopted a new honesty since the collar settled around her neck: “Enough.”

Mrs. Daly’s mouth twitched in satisfaction. “I suppose you never really stop looking, then.”

He is calling you a busybody, Geist thought, with fondness. “I try to look for grace where it hides,” she said.

Mrs. Daly moved on, and Geist took another hand, this one roughened by salt water. Long Beach did that to people who worked close to it. The city bred two kinds of palms: those softened by spreadsheets and those that had learned to tie complicated knots while the tide pulled. Geist had had both kinds of hands. She looked down at them sometimes like they were animals that had chosen to sleep in her lap, and wondered if anyone else could tell.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She ignored it. After the last hymn she had a family waiting in the garden, sitting in the shade of the bougainvillea and not looking at one another. Trouble had a posture. Geist navigated toward it.

“Thanks for meeting us,” said the father, tall but trying to make himself shorter, like maybe his height had started the trouble. The mother’s mouth was heroic. The teenager looked at her shoes like they had become revealing.

“Of course,” Geist said, and listened.

She had been raised among a different form of listening, the kind with tape recorders and case files. This listening was slower. It required more silence than an interview room allowed. The teenager cried without looking up. Her parents looked at the churchyard statue of Michael with his sword and tried to be inspired. Geist heard, as always, the friction between how hard it is to be a person and how hard it is to be a person in front of people you love. She suggested an appointment. She gave directions to a clinic. She wrote a phone number on a square of paper and folded it like a bird and told the girl it was hers to keep.

Only when they had gone did she take out her phone. Only when she had passed through the sacristy and into the office and closed the door did she allow herself to shift from vicar to something else, the way a dancer changes shoes in a corridor.

There were eight messages. Two were from her bishop. One from her sister—no, not today, please, God. She thumbed past family and saw a name that made her shoulders lift in what might have been hope and might have been dread if she did not know better. Even the number was familiar even though she had deleted it, years ago, on purpose, with prayer.

“Geist,” the voice said when she answered, never Vicar, not now, maybe not ever. “You got a minute?”

“Hello, Alondra,” Geist said, and leaned her head against the office door until the wood cooled her skin. “I’ve got sixty.”

“Make it twenty. I called because I promised myself I wouldn’t, and here I am like a liar. But. Something came across a desk today that made me wish for your eye, and maybe your way with people who don’t like being told what to do.”

“Is there a murder?” said Geist, too quickly, as if asking about a weather report.

“No. There’s a missing. A nurse. Lydia Kline. Thirty-three. These things happen less than you think and more than they should. She’s late for the first time in eight years, and her sister said she didn’t come home. The hospital called because protocol. The sister called because panic.”

Geist sat down in the wooden chair, the one that wobbled if she leaned too far to the right. “And you thought of me because…”

“Because you live three blocks from St. Danae’s now. Because you know the chaplain there. Because you like nurses.”

“Everybody likes nurses.”

“Not everybody,” Alondra said, and there was a weight to the word that made Geist’s heart give a small, complicated lurch.

She closed her eyes. “Do you think it’s connected?”

“I think the world is smaller than we pretend. I also think I can’t put a uniform into every break room in the city and tell them to breathe easy because we got it.”

“And you can’t officially ask me to help,” Geist said.

“I can ask if you’ve seen anything strange.”

“I am a priest on Ocean Boulevard,” Geist said. “Everything is strange. But yes, I will ask around,” she added in that level voice she had used at scenes and at bedsides, the one that convinced people she knew more than she did. “I will not interfere.”

“Interfere for me,” Alondra said, soft now. “We still owe you.”

Geist touched the small square of white at her throat, feeling its scratch, as if it were alive. “Nobody owes me,” she said, and the old detective in her laughed quietly, a dry little bird in a dry little nest, because of course they did.

When she hung up, she stared at the crucifix on the office wall. The wood was dark, almost purple, and you could feel the carver’s hand in the ribs. “Alright,” she said, and it wasn’t to God, not exactly, but if God wanted to take it personally, that was fine too. “Alright, I’ll ask.”

She made one more call, which went to voicemail. “Mara,” she said, and then stopped and counted, because sometimes that kept the panic from getting bigger. “I’m sorry I missed your text earlier. I know you don’t like voicemail. I’m making soup. That’s a lie. I’m buying soup. I’ll bring it to your dad’s place if you want to meet by the gate. Or not. You can tell me you don’t want to. You can also tell me anything. Call me back if you like.” She hung up quickly and wished she could take the word like out of her mouth and wash it.

She put on a plain jacket because Long Beach nights came with a wind even in summer, and walked the three blocks to St. Danae’s, where the lights were always a bit too bright and the smell of disinfectant wrangled with coffee in the corridors. She nodded at a volunteer humming to herself while folding blankets. She smiled at an orderly pushing a cart of monitors. She found the chaplain in a room with a window full of water and sky.

“Eva,” he said in that voice of his that made you think of stone warmed in sunlight. “Your people are everywhere today.”

“We breed in secret,” Geist said, to make him laugh, because she knew he needed to. “Have you got a minute?”

“For you, I have two.”

“I heard there was a nurse—”

“Lydia,” he said. His eyes gratefully fixed on the practical, as if that were an answer to grief. “We have been told not to tell anyone anything. You know how that goes.”

“Tell me what you need me to hear, then.”

He looked out at the water, which wore a moon like a bruise. “I don’t like the way the younger ones talk. Not about Lydia, but around the edges. There’s a sense—someone’s been…needling them. I don’t do the internet. You know that. But they’re on it all day when they’re off shift. They like to be told they’re seen. And then someone sees them.”

Geist’s skin tightened where it lay over her spine. “You know what the posts say?”

“I don’t want to know,” he said. “I only know how they feel.”

She went to the staff lounge because it had a bulletin board where people tacked up flyers for salsa nights and pilates, and sometimes, if the world was kind, news about bake sales. There was a clock that had stopped at 4:06 a long time ago, and a microwave that made a sound like a glottal stop. Two nurses, hair in buns that seemed fastened by thought alone, looked at their phones in tandem and did not see her.

“Excuse me,” Geist said, and when they turned she had that face ready, the one that said pastor and also hall monitor and also mother, all at once. “I’m Eva. I help out in the chapel sometimes.”

“We know who you are,” one said. “You’re the one who prays too short.”

Geist laughed. “You’ll like me, then. Listen…if somebody wanted to bother you, where would they do it?”

The nurses looked at one another and then back at her. One, with a name tag that said Simi, turned the phone around like she was showing off a new pet. The screen was a board she didn’t recognize. It looked like a place where people went to say the things they didn’t say in rooms with windows.

“Here,” Simi said. “Like this. They talk like they’re us. They make someone else look worse by sounding normal in comparison.”

“What do they say?” Geist said carefully, already feeling the answer in her ribs like a pressure front.

“That we shouldn’t be here, that we’re immoral, that we’re hypocrites, that we should get our hands out of people’s lives,” said the other nurse. “You know. The usual. It’s not even smart. It just wears smart like a jacket.”

Geist nodded, slowing the speed of her breath. She had known people like this when she wore a badge, and when she took it off, and when she put on the square of white. She knew exactly what they did with the word moral and where they tried to put it on the body. She did not need to ask what else they were saying.

“Anything particular to Lydia?” she asked.

“She’s careful,” Simi said, meaning perhaps she is a woman who has been careful all her life, in the small way women are careful even when they shouldn’t have to be. “She doesn’t have her phone out where anyone can see it. She doesn’t gossip. She goes to her sister’s on her days off and watches trash television. She brought brownies. That’s what I can tell you.”

“She ever talk about art?” Geist said. The word had leapt into her mouth without her permission. She had friends who allowed art to eat their lives and they called that vocation. She knew the way they felt about people who painted: like painters carried another program running behind their eyes.

Simi blinked, then shook her head. “If she did, it wasn’t to me.”

Geist thanked them and left the lounge, head down. In the corridor she leaned against the wall and let the weight of the building press into her. She listened to the sounds of a hospital at night: the lullabies for newborns, the beep of rhythms the body made whether or not you wanted them, the wheels, the doors opening and closing.

She was turning to go back toward the chapel when she saw it: a flyer pinned to a cork board near the elevator. A bold block of color—blue, like a bruise again, like the sky before rain. A gallery card. She stepped closer, eyes narrowing. The card was for a show at a small space in Alamitos Beach. Unflinching, the title said, over a cluster of hands painted in the kind of detail that made the fingers feel ready to move. Nurses at Work, the subhead said. Study of Care.

“Who did this?” she asked no one, the way she sometimes asked the sea who had put it there, the way she had asked patrol officers who had forgotten to bring cones for a scene. She read the name of the artist and tasted it. Catherine Glass. The font pretended to be austere but wanted to be loved.

The elevator doors opened. Two interns spilled out in a wave of glucose and eagerness. Geist plucked the card and slipped it under her jacket like a stolen wafer. She went home.

On her front steps was a package. It had been subjugated by three rubber bands and a piece of twine that cut a small wound in the brown paper. Geist turned the box and found no return address. The scrawl of her name on the label made something in her stomach prepare for impact.

She took it inside and put it on the kitchen table beneath the window. The glass rattled a little in the frame when the wind came up. Eva Geist, Long Beach, and the zip, that was all it took to bring what people wanted to say to your door. She got a knife from the drawer. She did not say a prayer, because sometimes prayers made people brave and she wanted to be careful. She cut exactly where the tape was and folded back the flaps of cardboard and then the top layer of tissue, and there it was: a small canvas, heavy for its size. Wrapped in brown paper again. The quires of packing around it were like a dismantled nest.

She carried the painting to the sink, because that was where the light was most honest. She felt ridiculous and frightened and very tired. She unwrapped the last layer and only then did she allow herself to look.

The painting was small. A study. Two hands. The skin made of undermixed whites so that the blue beneath still crawled through like veins. The nails pinked with alizarin. The middle and index fingers of the left hand were slightly longer than regulation, just enough to give a feeling, and the index finger bore a small white scar Geist had seen exactly once before, when Lydia Kline had scalded herself on a kettle at a fundraiser and laughed at her own clumsiness. The cut had healed in the shape of a comma.

The painter had seen it. The painter had noticed and turned it into scripture.

Geist set the painting down gently. She went to the sink and turned on the tap and watched the water run into emptiness until she could hear the roar in her ears quiet and blend with it.

There was a card with it, of course. There always is, in stories. It was tucked into the wrapping like a leaf pressed in a book. Geist lifted it with two fingers. The paper was cheap; someone wanted it to look expensive.

From a friend, it said, in a careful hand. Then beneath: You can see what I see. Finally: Keep your hands clean.

The old training rose up in her like a tide, not even asking if it was allowed. The vicar inside her sat down and took notes.

She took photographs. She put the painting in a grocery bag and tied it shut and then put the bag in a tote because it made her feel better to wrap it twice, like the world’s problems were cold and could be resolved by thickness. Then she sat at the little desk where she wrote sermons longhand because the keyboard robbed them of their breath, and she wrote a list.

Catherine Glass—painter—hands—nurses—gallery show. St. Danae’s—chaplain—Lydia—missing. Forums—language—moral codes bent into knives. Deliveries with no return address. The way the word friend curdles when a stranger uses it like medicine in a cake.

She texted Alondra the picture of the card and then the picture of the painting.

Alondra called immediately. “Tell me you’re at the station.”

“I’m at my sink.”

“Tell me you’re putting that in a locker.”

“It’s in a bag. It is thinking about the error of its ways.”

“Geist.” The voice that could pull a cavalry together if there were cavalry anymore. “Do not provoke. Do not reply. If this is the person—”

“This is the person who is looking at my life,” Geist said. “They have already been provoked.”

“Do we know who?”

“Catherine Glass. I have a name and the name has a space in a gallery where people bring plastic cups of wine to feel blessed by beauty. I have a postcard in my jacket.”

“Is that…is that the artist who does the hands?”

“Yes.” Geist closed her eyes and the painting came up behind them like a moon. “The hands.”

They were quiet for a moment in the way people are when a third person walks into a room and stands behind them and they aren’t allowed to turn around.

“I can send a car,” Alondra said finally.

“Don’t,” said Geist. “Come yourself.”

“People will talk if I bring police to a priest.”

“People already talk,” Geist said. “Let’s give them a new subject.”

Long Beach had a way of laying down its nights like spare blankets over a couch. The streetlights made cones of amber on the sidewalk. Far away, a train’s horn pulled at the seam of the dark and opened it, just a little. Geist locked her door. She put the painting back in its box. She didn’t look at her phone when it buzzed again. She did look up when a car eased to the curb and a woman in plain clothes climbed out and stood in the beam of the streetlight and looked exactly as confused as you might expect a detective to look when she heard the word vicar and found that it still described her friend.

“Geist,” Alondra said. “What did you pull me back to?”

“To the place you asked me not to leave,” Geist replied, almost smiling, and stepped aside to let her in.

When Alondra saw the painting she took one breath like someone hitting cold water. She did not touch. Instead she flicked her eyes to the card and toward the window and then to Geist’s hands, which were folded one into the other, the right tucked beneath the left, hiding the callus from her old service pistol.

“The paper,” she said. “Put it in a bag. The box. The wrapping. Everything. We’ll walk it in.”

“Alondra,” Geist said. “There’s more.”

“Of course there is,” Alondra murmured, unhappy with how often life was a pile and not a line. “Tell me.”

“There is a woman,” Geist began. She told her about the flyer. The almost-familiar name. The blue of the paint. The way the chaplain had said needling and how that was exactly the word the world chose when it was too polite to say harm. She told her about the online boards and the way people took care of each other there right up until someone told them what’s what, and how easy it is to lean into certainty when you’re tired and your shoes hurt and the person in the bed asks you to hold their fear. She told her about the freezer in her own mind, where she put the things she could not say.

“We need to move,” Alondra said. “We need warrants. We need an address. We need to find Lydia now.”

“I can go to the gallery,” Geist said.

“No,” said Alondra, a hand up. “You can’t go anywhere alone.”

Geist tilted her head. “You can’t assign me a guard.”

“I can ask you to submit to one out of a sense of good manners.”

“We were never good at manners,” Geist said, and the muscle in Alondra’s jaw went soft in affection even as her eyes stayed furious.

“Your daughter,” Alondra said, a small anchor thrown into the conversation like that would hold them if the water rose.

“I called her,” Geist said. “She didn’t answer.”

“Call again.”

“I will,” Geist said, and though she would, it would be later, after the box had left the table, after she had watched her old friend walk down her steps and carry a piece of the dark into a car and drive it away, and after the freezer in another house hummed and hummed and the paint on a pair of long, observing hands dried and cracked just enough so that one night they might look almost alive.

Outside, the wind picked up. Somewhere far out, gulls woke and bickered as if dawn belonged to them and not to the hospital cafeteria workers who would fill the trays with eggs and apples and the nurses who would take a late breakfast and swallow it standing up. In her pocket, Geist’s phone shivered once. A text. She pulled it out and saw a single word on the screen from a number with no name.

Friend, it said.

She deleted it and turned off her phone and went to the sink and washed her hands like she might be called upon to touch a stranger’s face and give them back their breath.

In the house where the freezer hummed, Catherine stood over her canvas and dabbed a line of light where the finger would have been if it were going to remain. She stepped back and saw that she had painted a tiny absence so exact it felt like music. She sat down and thought of the woman in the collar, the one who looked at hands like they were scripture. She had found her. Hello, friend, she thought. Let us teach the world to hold still.Alondra drove the painting like it might come awake if she hit a pothole. She glanced at the passenger seat the way people look at sleeping children, not wanting to be caught staring in case the gaze itself held teeth. The bag was doubled, the box nested inside, the card sealed in a plastic sleeve one of the CSU techs had handed her with a raised eyebrow and a mouth that said later. The city changed around her windows—bungalows with stubborn roses giving way to flat-fronted apartment blocks, then the half-empty lots where developers dreamed in glass and steel and tax breaks. The sky had that California talent for looking clean while it carried a hundred fires, a brittle transparency that made people think they were safe because they could see. At a red light she let herself remember the last time she had walked into the lab with a friend’s life in a bag, and the way the white tiles made all kinds of grief look more scientific. Her hands stayed loose on the wheel because there were officers who could hold a gun like a prayer and then there were the other kind, and she did not want to be either.

The lab absorbed them without comment. Fluorescent hum, a shushing of rubber soles, the cough of a centrifuge somewhere out of sight. Reyes, who liked his coffee sweeter than God intended and who had once given Alondra a sandwich when she didn’t know she was hungry, met her at the door. He lifted the bag with two hands although it weighed almost nothing and made a polite face when the painting came out, the way men do when they find themselves in the presence of art and wish they had brought better socks. He bent to the card as if it were a specimen pinned to felt. Alondra spoke in the clipped half-whispers that belong to rooms where glass might break, and Reyes nodded and wrote things in his small slanted print. He pointed at the edges of the canvas, at the backer board, at the lip of the frame. He talked about fibers, about skin cells that fall like confetti you can’t see, about what soap does and doesn’t do to oil paint. When he finished, he said what they always say, because it is both truthful and a ward against disappointment. He said it will take time, and Alondra smiled without her eyes and said she knew.

On the way out she stopped by Records and pulled what a person can pull without forgetting whom she wears on her chest. Glass, Catherine. Born inland. A driver’s license that had expired and been replaced with the same picture cropped tighter, as if the face had decided to step inward. Two addresses over the past decade, both on the map in neighborhoods that used the word up in front of their name although no one lived in a hill. A tax record for sales of “fine art” through a gallery that changed hands three times but never left its lease near Alamitos Beach. A permit for a show in six weeks. A small, neat history in the kind of precise boxes a careful person fills because they cannot abide a clerk’s messy handwriting. Alondra ran an index finger down the column of numbers and felt the thinness of it. People who look like that on paper make detectives nervous because it means they don’t spill.

Catherine rinsed the rancid brush water out behind the studio and watched the gray stream run between the cinderblocks as if it were remembering a river. Morning did the thing to the light she liked least, that diluted insistence that asked for energy she hated to spend. The studio was cooler than the rest of the house because she had learned the trick of shutting one vent and opening another to bruise the air into a draft. She had primed two canvases last night and they leaned against the easel like geese waiting for bread. She could not touch them yet. She needed the red that her hand got if it held a phone until it warmed, that little fever in the tendons. She wiped her fingers dry on a cloth the size of a handkerchief and sat at the bench and woke the swarm.

The forum in the morning was quieter, like a mall before doors open, only the mall walkers circling, the ones who have learned that ownership comes not from purchase but from muscle memory. She signed into three accounts and let four more trail behind her like a veil. She sent a private message to a person who had been trying to make themselves important near the nurse’s threads. The message was as careful as a cut in paper: praise first, a little shared outrage, a statistic that could be true, a pointed question with an answer attached. She put a photograph in the common feed, something wry and domestic and plausibly poor. The comments came like birds at crumbs. She set the timers. She folded a name into a small space and pushed it where it would catch a boot. Symmetry requires friction, she thought, that old taste on her tongue, like iron, like a nail bitten too far. She stared at the word Lydia until it went flat and then she pushed it away, because names are only useful as bridges. Across the room the blue of last night’s nursing dress had dried into a kind of quiet, a matte that drank light. She pictured the woman at the sink, the one with the square of white at her throat and the measured hands, and felt her ribs lift as if she had caught the right note in a room without good acoustics.

She went downstairs. The stairs complained as always and still no one came. The smell of pine held because she refreshed it with a capful when the bottle told her to, and because she wanted to remember that clean is a verb and not a state. The rope handle lay along the top of the lid like a docile snake. She looped the cloth, tied it to her wrist, made the knot she had made three different ways and always decided on this one because it would hold under stress but could be coaxed free if it had to be. When she lifted, the cold hit the wet inside of her nose and she closed her eyes and waited for the sting to settle. She reached her hand down, only one, because the other was not for this place, and touched the waxed paper the way you touch a pane of glass when you don’t want to wake the person on the other side. The ink on the tape did not bleed. Blue Shift. Witch Hazel. Break Room. Halo. She kept their painting names here because the other names were not for here. She taped the corners again, fussy habit, a seam upon a seam. The blue light turned her skin the color of conceits. She counted to twenty. She closed the lid and stood until her body realized it was warm again. When she went back up she held the railing with the hand that had been in the cold and told the tendons to be patient because they always wanted to clutch.

Geist bought soup like a confession. The deli woman put the lids on with a stern snap that said do not spill in my house, and Geist said thank you with that particular politeness she had honed when she used to hold out bags of possessions to mothers and ask them to identify what could no longer be worn. The day had decided early to be late summer, that drag of sun that sits and sits until the street tires of it. She walked the familiar blocks to Brian’s bungalow, whose small front garden had been a brave mistake when the marriage had ended, a show of cheerful competence that had not fooled her and only annoyed the bougainvillea. Brian had painted the trim twice since then and the color still looked like regret. Mara was sitting on the low concrete wall by the gate and she did not look up when Geist walked into the shade. Her hair had gone another color since last month. Geist refused to call it blue because there are bluebells and there is the ocean and there is God’s own sky, and this was none of those things. It suited her in a way that made Geist proud because it meant her daughter could do a thing for herself that was not meant to please a single soul.

“Hi,” Geist said, because you can say a lot with a small word if you mean all of it.

“Hi,” Mara said to her shoes, and then she looked up and Grimm’s fairy tale relief crossed her face because she had expected the wrong soup. “You remembered,” she said, and a person who had not raised this child would have thought that a victory. Eva let herself have it anyway because small mercies are still mercies.

They ate on the wall because the table by the window inside had too much history and too much mail. Brian’s car was not in the driveway and Geist thought she would thank him for that later when she could look him in the eye without bringing a whole other life into his kitchen. They talked about things you can look at while you talk—teachers who used the wrong names on purpose, a rash that had become a family drama and then left just to make space for another drama. Mara spoke about a friend as if she were rehearsing the past tense and Geist did not press because she had learned that some bridges look strong and are only ropes. There was a moment where Mara tilted like she might say something about a video and a pair of hands and the word “feed,” and then she righted herself with the stubborn grace of the young. Geist swallowed a sentence and let her daughter have her silence.

“I got a weird text,” Mara said, as if she were tossing a coin into a hat and seeing if it would make the rim. “It said ‘Friend.’ No number, just those dumb three digits at the front that mean it’s not real. I blocked it.”

“You did right,” Geist said, and her spoon made a small ring in the emptying bowl. “If you get any other ones you don’t like, tell me. Or tell your dad. Or tell the neighbor with the yappy dog who wakes the dead. Tell anyone, and then we’ll decide who needs it.”

Mara made her mouth into a line her father’s mouth could also make. “I don’t want a cop around,” she said, and Geist nodded because of course she didn’t. “Is it the church people,” she added, a flick of a glance toward the collar she wasn’t wearing, an apology already half-made.

“Sometimes it’s church people,” Geist said. “Sometimes it’s people who used to be church people and forgot. Sometimes it’s people who have never once set foot in a building like mine but know exactly what’s inside in the same way they know what’s in a pizza when they’re hungry.”

“They shouldn’t talk to nurses,” Mara said in the tone of the righteous, which is one of the tones you are allowed as an adolescent child of a woman like Geist. “They should leave women alone when women are tired.”

“Put that on a shirt,” Geist said, and Mara smiled with one half of her mouth, which was as close to any blessing as Eva required.

She did not go to the gallery alone. She stood on the corner one block away and watched the traffic do its lazy drift and let the younger detective old enough to order a beer and young enough that he still called her ma’am without irony catch up in his unmarked that looked exactly like an unmarked because there are only so many colors a budget can buy. His name was Tirado and he wore a shirt that decided the day was a party and a tie that had given up the fight. He took up a place half a pace behind her the way men do when they’ve been told your authority is not official but ought to be respected all the same. They stood outside and let the glass door reflect them for a moment—a woman in a jacket that had seen funerals, a man with a phone in his pocket he would not check—and then went in because it was worse to stand like that than whatever waited inside.

The gallery smelled like fresh caulk and lender wine. The walls were like the inside of a mouth that had been polished. The woman at the desk wore architecture where other people wore clothes and her hair made a shape that needed scaffolding. She smiled at them as deftly as if she had pasted the expression on at school and practiced in mirrors until it fit. Geist ordered her face into civility and found the exact pitch of voice between customer and confession.

“I’m looking for information about an artist you represent,” she said, and the woman at the desk folded her hands on top of a ledger in a gesture so rehearsed it became impressive.

“We represent a number of artists,” she said. “If you’re here about process or access, I can get you the catalogue. If it’s post-opening, we can discuss the list.”

“Catherine Glass,” Geist said, and something passed across the woman’s face that was not weather and not light. “I’m a local priest,” she added, letting the words arrange themselves into a posture which she had found moved certain rocks. “A member of my congregation is missing. I saw Ms. Glass’s show card at the hospital. I would like to begin believing that those facts have nothing to do with one another, but I have learned not to begin too soon.”

The woman’s hands flexed like fish and then settled back into their practiced prayer. “We are thrilled to be showing Catherine’s work,” she said, and the plural we made Geist’s gums itch, because who had been consulted to form that chorus. “She has a rare specificity. I can give you her press sheet.”

Tirado took one half-step and that was all. “We can make a request for contact details,” he said in a voice that put a fence around an idea without making it a prison. “Informal for now.”

The woman looked at the collar Geist was not wearing and at the badge Tirado was not showing, and in that small space between symbols came to a conclusion that suited her. “Catherine values her privacy,” she said. “She’s shy. She doesn’t like to linger at openings. She arrives like smoke, she leaves like it. We admire her boundaries here.”

Geist thought of the freezer hum and the neat tape. “Do you have any of her work on site?” she asked lightly. “Sometimes a person likes to see something twice. I am fond of repetition that improves the original.”

“In the back,” said the woman, with a hesitation that meant she had to decide whether letting this stranger breathe on the inventory would be worth anything later. She turned and the two of them followed, past a small kitchen with a bowl of fruit so glossy it had to be lied to, into a room with rolling racks and plastic sleeves. The light here was honest in a different way, a fluorescent insistence on facts. The woman flicked to a tab labeled with a blue sticker and pulled a rack out like a librarian. There they were: hands, many hands, close enough together that they felt like a crowd waiting at a red light.

Geist did not reach out. She leaned and read the tags the way you read name badges at a convention where you hate everyone. Daily Shift. Code. Quiet Hour. Jugular. On Call. Her own name did not appear. Lydia’s did not either, not in ink. It appeared in a tendon, in the slight crookedness of a thumbnail, in the way the middle joint of the little finger had a dignified swelling that told a story about a sprain healed under a mitten. The woman from the desk did not know what she was seeing and that was its own kind of warning.

“She’s very good,” the woman said, and it was an admission. “There’s a wait.”

“Where does she paint?” Tirado asked with the airiness of a man discussing bread makers.

“She prefers not to say,” said the woman, but she did not say she did not know, and in that little omission Geist’s mind wrote an address in the air in pencil. “We accept deliveries once a week. We do not impose on our artists’ processes. She is…fastidious.”

Geist stepped back because the pressure under her collar had become a hand. “If Ms. Glass comes in,” she said, “tell her a vicar came by with a question about ethics.” She smiled, and it was real in a way that made the woman take a breath, because there are kinds of sincerity you recognize even if you do not practice them.

They stood in the sun again and the day had slid forward without asking anyone. Tirado cleared his throat like he had been holding a list on it and now could not stand it. “My aunt’s a nurse,” he said, and then looked embarrassed by the way personal details insert themselves into cases you have not yet given permission to breathe. “I don’t like the hands. I mean, they’re beautiful. I don’t like them anyway.”

“They know too much,” Geist said, and he nodded like someone who had tripped and wanted to pretend it was choreography.

Alondra’s warrant would not ripen before night. She knew because the judge she liked to trust had a grandchild’s recital and a habit of believing in culture as a brake. The best she could do was a knock, and a look that an officer develops in a city like theirs, the one that says we will see each other again when you are not wearing shoes. She sent two uniforms to Catherine’s last known on a “check the welfare” and told them to be stupid in polite ways. They came back with the usual: a house that had learned how to be a diagram, a woman who was not home and a neighbor who had an opinion on hedges, a feeling they couldn’t put on paper because the scent of pine means nothing in a report.

That night, the wind found a chink in the living room window and played it like a bottle, producing a small whine that made Geist’s shoulders shuffle up and then down as if in response to music she pretended not to hear. She could not pray. She could not read. She did the thing she did when no other thing worked: she washed. The sink saw déjà vu and kept its counsel. The phone, dark on the table, made itself heavy. She did not give it her eyes. She moved the sponge around the rim of a glass until the concept of circles became absurd. Her old habit rose up, the one where she would place a uniform on a chair and sit across from it and talk to it instead of the person wearing it, because it is sometimes easier to address a symbol than a man, and she laughed at herself for keeping tools in a kit she had supposedly given back.

Down in her basement Catherine chose a new tape. Her handwriting had improved with practice to the point that it did what all good hands do: became invisible enough that it delivered content without calling attention to itself. She had stopped labeling when she was younger because of a suggestion she had taken to be a rule, and then she had realized that rules are only useful when they can be disobeyed. There are ways to hide in plain sight that do not involve shadows at all. She wrote a title in neat capitals and tilted the E just slightly because that was her fate; she could never quite make it perfect. She did math on the back of a cereal box about timing and ice and what the average human body will accept if asked nicely. She did not set a timer here because that would have been vulgar. She did not look long. She upstairs and ate an orange over the sink and let the juice run along her knuckle and into the cuff of her shirt because she liked the feeling of a bright thing going where it shouldn’t.

When the door knocked she knew it for what it was—the shape of the knuckles on the other side of the wood—and she did not let her breath quicken because breath does you no favors. The uniforms at her threshold were the flavor that grows in any precinct after a rain; their hats had experienced exactly one hour of respect and then many more of boredom. She made her mouth gentle. It was not a performance; gentleness had been her first language and she had learned this other one later, the language of limits. She let them tell her about a welfare check and an anonymous call and a neighbor who had heard a compressor at a strange hour. She laughed like a woman embarrassed by her own enthusiasm for old refrigerators and then she opened a door to a room that was more storage closet than basement, one she kept for this purpose, the decoy with a line of dead appliances sleeping like whales. They made sure there was nothing to trip on and then they left. The decoy hummed once for them because she had taught it to, a small pet trick. When she shut the door her hands trembled like an apology and she stood very still until it passed.

Geist slept badly. She dreamed of a corridor, the kind at St. Danae’s where the floor remembers every wheel, and in the dream the lights did that blink-blink cutting you see in documentaries when a person walks away from the frame. She held the hand of someone who had not introduced herself and she knew by the thinness of the skin that the person should have been elsewhere. She woke with the knowledge you get from dreams, which is not knowledge at all but certainty. On the table her phone had decided to look contrite. She turned it on and it filled with the world. Two voicemails. One from Alondra that began with the word update and ended with we wait, and one from a number she knew she was not supposed to know by heart anymore. She let Brian’s message unfold its mundane miracle—Mara’s fine, she hustles like a little heron, I can put her on a bike to yours if you want—for the way it cleans a mouth to hear kindness. She texted Alondra a question with no question mark. She drank coffee that was too bitter because she had forgotten the part that makes it civilized.

She had a funeral in the afternoon. She put on black but not too much black because the boy had been sixteen and a family thinks it is important that the world see they knew him as more than a procession of sorrow. She spoke in that clipped way she had found when people needed to be led and resented leadership. She said his name clearly and did not say God’s name as if it had been invited, and when the grandmother touched her arm and pressed, Geist squeezed back gently and did not pull away because in certain cultures love is measured by how much you will let a stranger hold you. After the burial, in the small stutter between the last spade of earth and the first policy conversation, she excused herself to the perimeter and made a call from beside a shrub that had been tricked into believing it was an evergreen. The line rang twice. The voice on the other end had slept less well than hers and drank better coffee.

“We got trace,” Alondra said without greeting. “Someone who writes on cheap cardstock with a medium weight roller pen. Supermarket brand. The pressure is…consistent. If I believed in God I’d call it surgical. Prints? Nothing. A grease smear we can’t turn into somebody. Fiber? Cotton, older washer. Canvas is a standard size out of a craft chain we could not burn down even if we wanted. The paint dries in layers like a person with money and no time. I have an address for the gallery freight drop. I have nothing for where she sleeps.”

“You have the show permit,” Geist said, and watched a boy in a suit that had belonged to an uncle try not to cry in front of his friends. “You have her name printed on paper strangers touch.”

“I have her name,” Alondra said, and made it sound like a tool and also like a violin.

“I have a feeling,” Geist said, and the old woman at the other side of the shrub looked up sharply as if the air had moved. “It smells like soap.”

“Geist,” Alondra said, and the syllable did the thing it does when you are fond and angry. “Do not go to her house. Do not go to her show. Do not pick up what she puts down.”

“I never pick up,” Geist said, and then hung up because sometimes the worst thing about friends is how well they know when you are lying.

At dusk, Catherine framed a hand. She had found the perfect rectangle and she had learned how to argue with matting until it agreed with her. She screwed the backing in with the small sigh of pleasure of a person who likes things that align. She signed the name she kept for public consumption in the lower left corner, the name that had been given to her by a woman who did not know what she was making. She watched the wetness dull and set the piece upright against the wall, where the light from the window made all the veins in its palm bloom to the surface. She thought of the vicar’s kitchen and the way the sink must have been chosen not for appearance but for competence. She thought of the words keep your hands clean and smiled at her own lack of subtlety. She had learned that the best threats look like advice. She washed her brush. She sent a message to the forum with a photograph of a pair of gloved hands holding a paper cup of coffee, and below it a sentence that was both true and venomous: No one has the right to touch without consent. She let it sit there and watched the replies lay themselves over one another, a weaving made by people who did not know they were building a trap.

That night the sea carried a conversation to Long Beach from somewhere old. The gulls made the same joke they always make. The trains did their masculine calling. In the apartment above the barber with the eternal pole, a saxophone tried to find the first bars of a song and gave up in favor of scales. In Geist’s house, the collar lay on the arm of a chair like a creature that would not be kept and the woman to whom it belonged stood at the window she had not yet paid to fix and counted backwards from a number large enough to make her lungs ache, because she had learned that pain is a good substitute for patience when patience is a luxury.

When her phone buzzed one last time before she let herself pretend to sleep, it was not a word. It was a picture. A hand, palm up, the line of life so long it looked like mercy. A smear of blue in the crease beneath the thumb that meant the person who wore it had been careless with ink or pen. A ring on the promise finger that had been there on Sunday and not on Monday. The message said nothing else, which meant everything, because it meant that Catherine had learned restraint, too. Geist saved the picture to a folder she had made that morning called Sermon Sources. She turned off the light. She lay down and looked at the ceiling until it became an ocean, and then she took that as a sign that she could begin to drown or begin to swim, and for now she held still, which is the third option that school never teaches you but water does.

In the freezer, the hum went on. One of the packages shifted as if the cold itself had memory and sometimes forgot who it had asked to be quiet. Catherine’s hand hovered above the lid like a benediction and then fell back at her side, because she was not a priest and would never pretend at prayer, not even here. Upstairs, she wrote a list on her palm in pen because she liked the intimacy of ink and because she could wash it when she needed to, which is a little like sin and much like paint. It read: Tide, rope, gallery, milk, gloves, tape. She flexed her fingers and the words distorted and then settled again, obedient as anything that believes it is only a tool.The building where Lydia’s sister lived had been repainted a color that wanted to be cheerful and had failed by half a shade, the hue of cookbooks that promise revival by way of lemon. The walkway upstairs was a lattice of shadows cast by potted plants that had survived on neglect and a southern exposure. The buzzer at the gate turned the vicar’s name brittle and then let her in anyway. Nora Kline opened the door with her foot because her hands were full of a laundry basket that was too clean for what it held. She had Lydia’s mouth, that compressed curve that looked like a hard line until you saw it break, and she wore an old T-shirt for a band that had never made it and yoga pants that had never seen yoga.

“Come in,” Nora said, and there were boxes against the wall that had never been unpacked although she had lived here for six years, and a table with one corner propped by a foreign paperback, and a photograph of two girls on a Ferris wheel with the ocean behind them that had the bright gloss of a summer you still believed no one was watching.

Geist stepped inside and let the smell of clean cotton and fried onions and something that wanted to be basil sheet over her. She put her hands on the back of a chair in a way that suggested she asked permission without speaking, and Nora nodded at the chair like it could talk for her. There was a mug on the table that said Nurse Fuel in a font that should have been arrested, and a second mug that said Sister Fuel in a copycat font, and the joke that had made them feel like a unit last Christmas crawled out of the ceramic and sat, uneasy, on the table between them.

“I don’t know why you,” Nora said abruptly, and then she looked as if she wanted to apologize for the way the words had kicked. “I mean, I don’t know why the hospital sent me the chaplain and then you showed up in my doorway and the police called and hung up. I don’t want a crowd and I don’t want to be rude, and I don’t know who to tell that to, because Lydia is always the one who answers her phone when I don’t.”

“The chaplain is my friend,” Geist said gently. “The detective is my friend in another way. I am here because sometimes a person needs a stranger who is not a stranger. If you would like me to leave, I will leave and ask the chaplain to visit again, and you will have been kind enough to tell me that your door closes.”

Nora breathed and some of the steel inside her unclenched. She pushed the basket onto the floor and it made a fabric sigh. “Lyd was never late,” she said, and she glanced at the clock though it was useless to do so, because the clock would not tell her the thing it had never known. “Even when she was sick. Even when she forgot to eat. She would text me a picture of a vending machine and call it dinner and I’d bring her leftovers like a bribe and she’d pretend to be offended, and then she’d eat on a chair with her feet on the rung like a kid. She has weird hands. Did they tell you that? Double-jointed knuckles from when she learned the violin and then quit after three lessons. She can pop the middle finger joint like it’s a trick.”

“I’ve seen her hands,” Geist murmured, and Nora’s eyes snapped up, something like accusation riding under gratitude.

“Where,” she said, and then softer, ashamed of how hard it sounded, “Where did you see them?”

“At a fundraiser,” Geist lied neatly, because there are truths that arrive too early. “She burned herself on a kettle and laughed about it, more at the kettle than anything. The scar is small. It looks like a comma.”

Nora’s mouth did the not-smile that belonged to people who had lived with nurses. “She hates that scar because it makes her look like she doesn’t know how to pour water. She told me once that it was good for her, because it reminded her that even people who know injure themselves when they’re tired.”

There were three frames leaned against the wall by the television. Nora noticed Geist look and shook her head. “She bought me art for my birthday last year,” she said, and the sentence had the reluctant amazement of a person who had argued for Target prints her whole life and lost beautifully. “Not expensive. She said ‘support the small ones and the women; we are small but not women.’ This one is a watercolor of coffee cups, and this one is a print of an old cookbook cover, and this one is a tiny oil of hands. I told her I liked the first two better. The hands thing freaked me out.”

Geist stepped closer and bent slowly, letting the frame tell her its story. The oil had been done by someone with affection for skin, not the reverence Catherine wore like armor. It was clumsy in places and clean in others, a study of two hands in a bowl of water, the way the light breaks across the metacarpals as if it has been taught to seek. The signature was a surname she didn’t know. There was nothing in it of Catherine’s icy articulation. She stood again and kept her voice level.

“Did she say anything recently about people online,” she asked. “I know it is an invasive question. I mean the kind of invasion that sneaks under a door. Comments. Messages. Pictures that were not meant for her.”

Nora got off her chair and went to a drawer in the painted kitchen unit. She opened it and took out a stack of index cards banded with a rubber band that had seen better elasticity. She unbanded them and fanned them out on the table like she had discovered a game she had forgotten how to play. Each card had a grocery list in Lydia’s cramped neat; almond milk, cumin, bleach, pens. On the back of each were numbers like prayers and three-letter handles circled so that they would not slip. Nora’s finger tapped one card that had a small grease mark on its corner like a dimple.

“She stopped posting pictures of her face after winter because people turned kind,” she said, and the word kind made the air cooler. “They said thank you. They said angel. They said soldier. And then they said you are not God. They said you think you are God. They said your hands are not clean. She blocked. She changed names. She sent me one of those stupid memes that said ‘log off and touch grass’ and I went and got us tacos and we ate on the grass by the library because she wanted to be funny about it. Last week she got a message that said Friend and I told her to throw her phone in the ocean and she told me to stop trying to save her and we laughed and then we turned our phones off for the rest of the day. I turned mine back on in the morning. Hers didn’t.”

“Do you have the number,” Geist asked, and Nora nodded and pointed at the card. The number was the kind with a front that announced it was pretending, a block of digits that moved when you chased them. The handwriting on the card was Lydia’s and it was steady. Her steadiness made Geist want to break something for her, which was a feeling she recognized and did not indulge.

“I know the chaplain,” Geist said. “He knows we are asking. He will help us pry with a spoon where a crowbar would get us arrested. If you get anything else, any scrap of kindness that feels wrong, tell me. Tell me even if it is 4 a.m. Tell me and then do not answer.”

Nora nodded and folded the index cards back into their band like a ritual. Her fingers shook only once and then remembered how to behave. “I keep thinking I shouldn’t have sent her that cake,” she said. “I got it from the fancy place with the marzipan fruit on top because she hates marzipan but she loves pretending, and I wrote on the note eat sugar and spite death. I thought I was being hilarious. Do you ever say a thing and then want to go back and give your mouth to someone else.”

“All the time,” Geist said, and she meant it more than she had meant anything all morning. “I say things like I don’t need the old job and I don’t miss what the old job did to my bones, and then I dream I’m in a hallway with a clock that doesn’t know how to move and my mouth is chewing on the numbers to try and make them kinder.”

“When they find her,” Nora began, and then looked at the wall over the sink as if it was what was keeping her upright. “When they find her, tell them I’m not mad at the nurses who kept her too late. They are not carpenters. They cannot make shelves inside time.”

“I will tell them,” Geist said, and they stood in the small kitchen and the washing machine in the hall reached its spin and jittered like something nervous, and for a moment all the grief in the city quieted and let two women breathe the same air without asking them to pay for it.

Alondra hit send on the affidavit and felt the drop in her blood that meant it was going to sit on a desk somewhere while a man whose tie said it was the first week of the rest of his life counted reasons not to ruin someone else’s evening. She put one finger against her temple and pressed because she had learned the trick of moving headaches around like chairs. Tirado stood in the doorway and asked if he could talk on it, meaning could he put his voice next to hers without bumping something delicate, and she nodded and said if he used the word exigent one more time she’d make him write it fifty times on the whiteboard in cursive. He grinned like a kid who has not yet had his heart broken by a search that yields nothing but the smell of polish, and he said he was thinking of the freight address and the gate with the dent and the tire tracks that had paint in them like a secret you would not tell your mother.

“Plate reader picked up a pickup that shouldn’t be in Alamitos Beach unless it’s lost,” he said, and he put the screen down on her desk with the reverence men used to reserve for vinyl. “Registered to a staging company that rents to a gallery that used to be a restaurant that used to be a pawn shop. The back lot camera is out, but a bodega across the alley has a door bell camera aimed at nowhere that sees everything. They got a woman in a baseball cap loading canvases with gloves on like she hates fingerprints and loves cotton. The camera learned nothing about her face, which makes me like her less.”

“She likes process,” Alondra said, and the word felt like teeth. “She is the kind who alphabetizes spices not because it makes her feel in control but because it is the only way she knows how to breathe.”

“Do we knock,” he asked, and she looked at the clock and thought about a man in a tie and said tonight we knock, and if we have to come back tomorrow with a piece of paper that says we have permission from a man in a tie, we will. She called Geist and got nothing because Geist was speaking over a casket and then speaking over deli meat, and then she texted and the read receipt sat like a small boat out of gas. She told herself she respected other people’s jobs and then she drove toward the house with the painted vents and the polite hedges that had been told that rectangles were good morals.

Catherine washed the paint off her wrists with a bar of soap that said cedar and lied. The house had been set for company since she made the decision to let them enter if they asked picturesquely. The decoy room had been rehearsed until the refrigerators performed on cue. She had walked through the things they would touch and the things they would be too embarrassed to touch and had left a few almost-dirty dishes by the sink the way a person who is trying to pass a test might. The true places had been folded into the house so well that she had stopped seeing them, which is always the danger of living with your own rituals. The rope handle had been scrubbed along the cottened cloth until it smelled like a road in rain, and she had put on soft socks because the woman with the square was a person who would hear a shoelace whisper and look, and Catherine felt generous enough to make the looking feel like a privilege.

They knocked as a demonstration of education. The knock had the rhythm of a person who had been taught to wait five seconds and then another five if the house itself sent a message through the door that suggested you should stop. Catherine smiled at the peephole as if the glass could remember affection, and then she opened the door with her shoulders down like she was coming out of a classroom and not a story.

“You worried me,” she said sweetly, because she knew a certain kind of officer cannot resist an apology they did not earn. “The last fellow said someone thought my freezer was haunted. You know how that goes. I watched a horror film once and it ruined me for compressors.”

Tirado looked over her shoulder because he had yet to be told not to, and Alondra kept her face where hers was brought and beheld a room that wanted to make them feel petty. The art on the wall was early work, studies of dandelion clocks in thin blacks and grays that announced that hand and eye had been born together. A notebook lay on the table open to a page with a grocery list and the word tithe crossed out and replaced with tide. A cat who was not a cat hair’s worth of evidence jumped onto the sofa and arranged herself into a demonstration of innocence that would make a jury angry on its own behalf.

“We had an anonymous concern,” Alondra said, and kept her coat on until the weight of it made the air in the room feel shared. “We prefer to resolve concerns without paper that takes up time and leaves ink in places it tends to embarrass. May we look at your back room.”

“The one with the refrigerators,” Catherine said, and made a face at the ridiculousness of being a woman who collected old appliances, which she wasn’t and which she was. “It’s a family joke. I told my mother once I was going to make a kitchen big enough to hold my life, and she told me to start by buying a pan that fit my cupboards. I failed. You can laugh. I did.”

She led them down the polished hall and opened the door with a flourish that would have made another woman look nervous. The decoy room did its job. The unplugged machines dreamed in a row. The smell of dust and motor oil rose like childhood. Tirado did what he had been taught to do and bumped a corner with his hip and listened to see whether the machine had learned language. Alondra walked the perimeter and found a stack of plates that had done nothing wrong and a roll of duct tape that had been cut with a scissor and not a tooth. She stood in the doorway and held in her mind the map of the house the way you do when you are afraid of missing a door. She turned back into the hall and let her hand slide along the wood of the wall until it met a moment where the nail had been set and caulked by someone who knew that walls are not always ends.

“Where do you paint,” she asked, and Catherine’s mouth curled, pleased bookishly by a question she wanted to be asked.

“Up,” she said, and the syllable was a small ascension. “Light and heat and air and a roof that doesn’t leak if it can help it. My father used to say, ‘If you love a thing, don’t put it where the rats can smell it,’ which was a mercy disguised as counsel. Would you like to see my studio.”

“We would,” Alondra said, and they went upstairs and Catherine let them see exactly as much as she had decided to show, which was not nothing and not sufficient. The studio had a thin honesty to it right now because she had spent the afternoon using the sun as an alibi. The two primed canvases tilted in a way that said she was tired of looking at white. The brushes were washed and wedged between terrycloth folds like sleeping swans. The window had been cleaned recently with vinegar because glass loves vinegar secretly, and the sill had the ring where a jar had sat too long. Alondra stepped to the paintings leaned against the far wall and read the tags and pretended to be a woman with a checkbook, and Tirado stood in the doorway because he had been taught in a painful exercise that doorways are what kill you.

“Do you accept visitors by appointment,” Alondra asked, and Catherine shook her head with a humility that had teeth.

“I am not good with visitors,” she said. “I am better with the conversation a person’s hands have when nobody can hear them.”

Alondra kept her eyes kind. “Do you know Lydia Kline.”

Catherine’s face did a very small thing that human faces do when they are attached to brains that can count. It was the shift you might make if you had been asked at a party if you knew a friend of a friend, and you had danced with the friend of a friend once in a kitchen in winter and felt nothing and something both at once. The chaplain would have called it a flinch and told Alondra to look for the throat pulse. Alondra watched anyway and saw that Catherine remembered the muscles she had chosen for shyness. She shook her head with a precision that would satisfy a camera and an untrained witness.

“I don’t know names,” she said, which was not what had been asked. “I draw from strictures. I draw from structures. I like rules because they make it possible to see what breaks them. The nurses at St. Danae’s do good work and terrible work like all people. They are not mine to know. I admire them the way you admire anything that has learned to be both necessary and resented.”

“We found your card on a board in their break room,” Alondra said, and she let the card itself stay in its plastic in her bag, a sharp thing softened by sleeve.

Catherine smiled in the direction of a corner of the room where she kept the plastic bin of promotional postcards like a sin she was trying to grow out of. “I put a card in a library once and a man with a suit told me art is for buyers and I told him art is for liars, and then he wrote a check with a number on it that made me understand the virtue of the partial truth. People should see what I do before they decide whether to hate it. The hospital has good light in its foyer. I would paint there if I could bear the noise.”

They left after an appropriate amount of admiring that did not feel like admiration. Tirado wrote down the color of the caulk and the distance between the vent and the frame of a door because he had learned that the body likes metrics when it feels like it is working on faith. Alondra shook Catherine’s hand and felt the small callus at the base of the thumb, the one a person gets when they hold a brush with sincerity and not with posture, and it made her want to scrub her palm with salt. Catherine shut the door with the same pressure she had used to open it and then stood with her forehead against the cool paint for a time long enough to remember that there are hearts in a house that are not yours and you can make them beat faster from the other side of a wall if you like.

In the chapel, the chaplain put his hand on the back of a chair and leaned as if he were going to speak to God and had decided they could both sit down for it. Geist came in quietly and did not stand at the rail because the rail turned her into a figure and she preferred work to figure. He lifted his head and she lifted hers and the corners of both their mouths made a pact not to overdo it.

“They visited her,” she said, and he kept his face still and let his breath do what faces are not allowed.

“They will visit her again when a different piece of paper is signed,” he replied. “In the meantime, my young ones are eating sugar like penance. If you know where to store worry so it does not injure the lungs, tell me and I will order the parish a crate of whatever it is.”

“We store it in the knees and pretend we’re praying,” she said, and he grunted because he was too pious to laugh.

“Your daughter,” he ventured, because chaplains and parents have a treaty that goes back to a village with a well.

“She is very certain,” Geist said. “It is her job. She told me to tell men to leave women alone when women are tired. I intend to print it on bulletins and make my warden apoplectic.”

“She is not wrong,” he said. “She is also a young woman in a city where men see hands and imagine the rest, which is not new and somehow still surprises me every week.”

“Someone sent her a picture,” Geist said, and he closed his eyes because he had seen that world try to climb the pulpit and had put both hands on the book and leaned. “She blocked and we will live as if the blocking is a sacrament, which perhaps it is.”

He turned his head toward the nave, where lilies planted for funerals had outlasted the men who had planted them. “What will you preach,” he asked, and she looked at the floor where a child had dragged a pew pencil in a soft dark circle.

“The ethics of looking,” she said. “What we owe to the seen and what we owe the ones who refuse us. I will say there is a difference between watching over and watching through, and my favorite usher will tell me it is too abstract and then I will bless him and steal his mints.”

“Make a point about hands,” he said, and she nodded because she had already written down three and wanted to see if God would allow the fourth.

Catherine returned to the forum like a woman stepping onto a stage where her character was deeply beloved. She had prepared a small storm and watched the air shift. A thread that had begun as a complaint about parking had elongated into a treatise on entitlement and drawn toward it the kind of people who liked to be seen as principled with very little expense. She placed a remark in the fifth comment that disarmed and invited, and then in the twelfth, she let a small cruelty loose and watched it be read as courage. The private messages bled into one another and made a river. She let three swim past that were pure bile because they were not aesthetic enough to give her pleasure. She answered one from a woman named Phebe who had been told she was too soft for medicine and had grown a rind. Phebe thought she had found a friend who saw how hard she worked and how often she was invisible, and Catherine did not disabuse her, because she had learned that half-truths in the right throats are hymns.

She drafted a post she would not send yet, one that would be framed as a meditation on attention. It would include the hands of a statue and the hands of a vicar and the hands of a mother, and it would ask the kind of question the answer to which was already in the reader’s pocket. She attached a photograph of a hand with blue lodged in the crease at the thumb and saved it as a draft. She put a very short message into a very long thread: Keep your hands clean. She watched the phrase be picked up and shined like silverware. She pressed her own hand against the table and saw the ink on her palm print onto the wood, and she took a cloth to it because there are messes that may be left for hours and there are messes that betray habit.

The warrant arrived when the sky had decided to become lavender to make the palm trees feel like they were part of a sarabande. Alondra signed for it from a courier whose hair had been dyed the exact color of a thing called candy-apple when candy apples were still permitted to be absurd. She sent a text and a car and another text and stood at a map on the wall and notated routes with a pencil that had been chewed by a man whose name she could not remember without seeing him spill coffee on his tie. The second visit had less apology and more permission. The lock on the side gate did not like to be unlocked and then was. The neighbor across the street whose hibiscus had learned to grandstand put his hand on his stomach as if to suggest he had every right to it. The cat was put in a bathroom where it denied the existence of the police pleasantly.

The officers moved through the house like people who have been told to not break anything and know they now will. The upstairs yielded a notebook with studies of a vicar’s hands, which is to say it yielded a notebook with studies of hands that had lately been placed into a position over a book. The back room yielded no more than it had promised to yield. The walls of the hallway did not open though they had been asked kindly. A small room off the kitchen had a cupboard into which people had put things when they did not know where else to put them; inside were plastic bags knotted exactly and a stack of waxed paper sheets packaged with a brand name that tried to be a folk song. Alondra took one sheet and held it up to the light and saw what she had expected: nothing.

Reyes called to say the fibers on the card were interesting in a way that made him happy, which was always disconcerting, because it meant he had found a thread he could pull without unraveling everything at once. The paint on the edges of the canvas had been cut by a knife that had a notch in it, infinitesimal but characteristic, the way a person’s gait shows a very old injury. If they found another canvas with that notch, they could laugh at a coincidence together. It would not be many hours, he promised, because his team had been taught by a woman who had made them all better by simply being the kind of person you feared disappointing.

Geist closed the church after Compline and found a man asleep in the last pew as if God had been placed there only to watch him breathe. She woke him with four inches of space between them and put a bottle of water in his hand and let him leave by the side door because dignity likes exits not designed for it. She stood in the nave and looked at the cross that leaned left even though the warden had sworn he had fixed it. She could have made a speech about perverse creation and the art of angle, but she had run out of patience with her own cleverness and with other people’s. She thought of Lydia placing a hand over a child’s fist to teach them how to thread a straw into a juice box. She thought of Catherine running her fingers along the rim of a jar to decide whether it would leak. She thought of Alondra on her feet for twelve hours because every chair in the building had been drafted into service by someone more tired. She folded her own hands because it was the last thing that made sense and the first thing she had ever been taught.

At the very edge of their net, a boy who stocked shelves at a hardware store counted rope by the hands he had seen take it. He had a memory good for faces and useless for anniversaries. He remembered a woman with a cap and a pare of soft socks at the register. He remembered the way she had said the word pine in the way that suggested it had been taught to her as a tree and she had made it a verb. He had bagged waxed paper and a box of nitrile gloves and a piece of chalk he had given her for free because it had broken. He had said, “You’ll need a bigger bag,” and she had laughed with her mouth closed and said, “Isn’t that always true.” He told this to a woman with a badge whose hair was the color of a low flame and who made him feel as if he were in a story he would never tell correctly. He drew his memory of her hands in the air and the woman nodded in a way that suggested he had not ruined anything yet.

The night moved as if someone had an appointment with it and the appointment had been moved. The freezer hummed like something trying to hold an idea. Catherine lay on the floor of her studio and looked up at the beam she had always meant to sand and then had decided to leave because its notched bark made the room feel as if it had a spine. She spoke a sentence aloud to hear how it sounded in a space that had given her back every sentence she had said in it for ten years. She said, “Friend, you are late,” and heard it come back to her with the weight she had wanted, and she smiled because she had learned the oldest trick, which is that if you say a thing enough times to the right surfaces, it begins to mean what you say it means. She stood and wrote on the margin of a canvas the words halo and proof and Sister Fuel because she liked how language bleeds into itself, and she wiped her hand on her jeans like a person who does not care about stains and then went downstairs and opened a door that held cold as if it were liquid, and she let it be her again, the shape of her breath reminding her that warmth is a choice as much as it is a state.

When dawn took Long Beach by the chin and turned its face toward the ocean the next day, the city looked briefly like a place where nothing bad could happen if people woke early and put coffee on. Geist sat on the front steps because the kitchen had too many conversations napping in it. She held her phone in both hands as if it were a book being read to her by a child and she wanted to get every word right. There was a message from Alondra that contained only two phrases: nothing yet and don’t walk alone. There was a message from the bishop with a correction about the hymn numbers that felt like mercy. There was a message from Mara that said she would be late because she had promised to get a friend out of a house where a conversation had gone feral and the adults had decided to hunt it. There was a picture from a number with the wrong first three digits, a hand against a blue wall, the veins full of paint as if the blood had learned a new color. She turned the phone face down on her knee and said a prayer, a small one she had been taught as a child and had never much liked because of the lists in it, and she said it anyway, and when she had finished she looked up and saw a woman across the street with a dog who stopped to tie her shoe, and their eyes met, and they both performed the nod that says we are not each other’s problem, and then the dog sneezed, and the woman laughed in a way that made Geist’s throat close because ordinary laughter finds its target without malice, and sometimes you can live on that for hours.

At St. Danae’s, the nurses put on their gloves and counted med cups and introduced themselves as if the introduction would always be received as grace. Simi found a card slipped under the break room door that said Thank you in a font that might have been called Sunday, and her stomach hurt as if the words were a rich food she had eaten too fast. She took it to the chaplain and he looked at it the way a man looks at a coin he has fished out of a fountain and cannot decide whether to keep or put back. He took it from her between two fingers and did not put it down, which was the closest he could come to throwing it away. He asked her how many hours she had slept and she lied because she had learned to make that lie sound like the truth was a luxury, and he let her because there were too many rules he could follow and too few he could enforce.

The gallery opened an email from a person who signed herself Catherine Glass with a skittish smile in the syntax and a request for an earlier delivery slot because she was in a mood and did not want to argue with traffic at noon. The woman at the desk replied with a well, which is an English form of surrender, and then added a smile that looked old enough to buy liquor. She wrote to a donor whose wife had fallen in love with a study called Quiet Hour and told him he could have it if he promised to bring her back for the opening, and he replied with an amount and a smile that looked like what it was. She checked the list of titles and paused at one that had not been there yesterday. It said Blue Shift II, and she made a face because in her jurisdiction the sequel is seldom as good, but the painter had written a note about diptychs and narrative and she was susceptible to coherent theory. She printed the label because she liked things to be ready for someone else to mess up.

In the lab, Reyes ran a check against canvases from two other galleries that handed over their inventory without a warrant because they had decided it was in their interest to act as if they were choirs and the police were their conductor. He found the notch, the tiny shadow in the cut, on a corner of a piece called Witch Hazel and on another called Break Room. The titles made the hair on his arms decide they were outside, and he told himself his hair was simply being dramatic. He called Alondra and told her that he could now say with some comfort that the same hand had cut all three. He did not say, because he did not like melodrama, that he thought there would be a fourth. He said it was nice to have expertise that mattered and then he hung up and stood very still in the cold light of the lab until he remembered to breathe with his shoulder muscles and not just his ribs.

They arrived at the gallery an hour before opening the day the diptych was meant to be hung. Catherine had made the delivery at dawn because she appreciated the audacity of cheating her own rule. She had left a thank-you on the desk that had been bought at a Scandinavian place that believed the world could be assembled with a small hex key, and the thank-you had the style of a person who had once worked at a front desk and had promised herself that when she left she would not become cruel about other people’s administrative work. The back room had the smell of cardboard that has learned it will never be more than cardboard. The rack held the new pieces: Blue Shift and Blue Shift II. The tags were printed and crisp. The woman who wore architecture wondered whether the price would feel too far north of what she could defend to the donors who liked to think they were discovered by her. She touched the corner of one canvas to steer it onto the brace and then chose to step away because it felt indecent to make contact with something that wished to be looked at without being handled.

Geist and Alondra stood side by side in the middle of a white room and did not look at one another because there are times you look with a friend and times you look alone. The hands on the wall arranged themselves into a story without needing anyone’s help. A pair of blue sleeves, the kind with modesty built into the cuff. A forearm that knew more about gravity than it wanted to. A ring finger that had been ringed, then not ringed. A small scar shaped like a comma raised from the paint slightly, the miracle of gesso. The title label sat underneath like an usher who had learned to be helpful without making conversation. The woman from the desk said she had coffee and would keep out of their way as if she were a ghost who knew the floorboards too well. The two of them stepped, and in stepping, decided that whomever this was that they had found in the paint did not belong on a wall. Alondra took a step closer because she was allowed. Geist reached into herself for anger and came back with hunger; the hunger was older and less clean, and she sighed because she knew now that she would have to go out and feed it the hard thing called justice.

Outside, the delivery truck made a sound like a throat clearing. The palm trees shook their dry skirts and rehearsed the gossip they would be forced to carry later. Somewhere in the city a hand wrote a name on tape and the pen did not stop where it could have. Somewhere else a hand closed a book and laid it aside and touched another hand because it could, because the people involved had consented to the glory of it, and because the world had not been entirely given over to hunger. Somewhere between the two someone with steady fingers and an aversion to spectacle lifted a lid and let the cold roll in, counted to twenty, and then changed her mind about what twenty meant.Chapter 6

The white room behaved like a tide pool when the door was shut, the kind that holds its own weather while the ocean drags itself around the corner. The two canvases hung where a curator with good bones had imagined them: Blue Shift and Blue Shift II, a diptych only because the painter had decided the world needed to learn another word for doubled. The first was the study they already knew how to look at, though knowing did not make the looking kind. The tendons rose like taught truths, the veins were rivers the color of winter, and the little white comma of a scar settled where it always had, waiting for a sentence to be formed. The second canvas was the reason Alondra called for air and Geist found herself with nothing in her hands and nowhere to put them. The left hand wore its ring finger as a suggestion more than a presence, a perfect absence painted with a tenderness that made the stomach threaten revolt. The knuckle was a balmy swell of light where it should not be, a smoothing that turned pain into taste. You could not see blood because that would have been gauche. You could see the consequence of a rule.

“The ethics of looking,” Geist said under her breath, not in prayer and not in blame, and the words reached the painting and slid off it like oil off water. “She wants us to practice our piety on a wound.”

Alondra’s shoulders sat happy for no one, pulled up, set forward, a posture you acquire when the world asks you to keep it from doing what it loves best. She stepped close enough to force the line between respect and persistence into attention. The brushwork was so fine that any prints left in the paint would have belonged to God. The edge of the canvas had, just there, that tiny notch Reyes had loved like a person can love a thorn if it proves a bush exists. The title label beneath had a sentence that wanted to be a thesis and failed modestly: Nurses’ Hands, Night Shift. Study of absence.

“She is telling us without telling us,” Alondra said. “We can’t hang a body on this, but we can hang a warrant.”

Geist reached up and, with a self-control she paid for moment by moment, put her finger just to the left of the scar, hovering the way a person does when they would like to bless and have learned the difference between desire and right. The gallery woman out front was deliberately making noise with a stapler so that she would not be accused of listening, and the sound made the room feel like an office party, which would have been obscene if either of them had allowed it to be. Eva lowered her hand and tucked it into her pocket where it could be good.

“She is teaching me,” Geist said, and Alondra cut her a look as if to say if you turn this into a sermon I will find another vicar whose God is not so fond of art.

“She thinks she is teaching me,” Catherine thought later, walking away from the alley behind the gallery as if distance were a garment and she had become bored of its color. The early heat made the palms dull in their hauteur. She had left the canvases in their sleeves with the joy of someone posting a letter. The blue on the second had dried into the skin the way water dries into a cup that has been drunk from—an echo, a trace, the mouth months later remembering the feel of it. She let herself stop at the bodega on the corner and buy a soda she did not want because rituals around commerce make people dismiss you. The boy behind the counter had a scar along his thumb that spoke of a blade that had been taught disobedience, and she admired it the way you admire a dog you will not take home. In the cooler, the bottles stood in their military discipline, and she looked at their cold without desire and smiled.

The studio was a deck of cards shuffled perfectly into order. She did not like to leave it that way, but this was a day to disregard taste in favor of order’s power to deceive. The cloth she used on the rope handle had been washed until the texture lay down and behaved, holding a smell that promised forests to anyone who had never had to sweep sap from floorboards. She went down to the basement because saying you will not does not alter your feet. The hum met her like a familiar argument you love for its predictability. The light through the lid painted her forearm with a blue that in other years other women had sought in bottles and prayers.

The craft of a room is not the most interesting thing about it, unless you are the one who built it. Catherine had taught herself angles the way some people teach themselves how to lie: she began small, in practice, and then grew confident until she could mislead with a glance and no words. The wall that was not a wall wore a wainscot taken from a house that had been ashamed by its own wealth; the molding had been planed down so it would not brag. Behind it, the cold had its kingdom and its rules. The overage freezer—the one she invited the curious to photograph and mock—had learned to hum on command after she paid a man with sensitive fingers to teach it the trick. The true machine sat like a loaded word and pretended to be a tool. The isolation foam she’d chosen didn’t argue with the world until three in the morning, and by then the neighbor with opinions about hibiscus had tired himself with his own vigilance. Catherine checked the tape the way you check someone’s temperature with your hand to the brow when you love them; it was a mothering gesture without motherhood.

Names are a complication, she reminded herself, standing in the interim space with its honest salt-and-pine brightness. Blue Shift had been an indulgence in punning and she should have denied herself that. Witch Hazel felt almost like a joke you tell in a tongue your child does not yet have, and she should hate that savor. Break Room made her think of the way the world insists on punishing places it asks to carry its kindness. Halo she allowed because light is the one theology she respects. She wrote another, now, the ink reliable and her hand uninterested in flourish: Proof of Life. She put the tape on the tabletop rather than the package, a rebuke to her own sentimentality. Then she closed the lid because she was not a woman who lingered, not even with herself.

Alondra disliked thermal cameras because the world, when seen through them, becomes a map of suffering and there are very few amusements in ending your career with more maps. She stood with a tech who had put a sticker on the case that announced the machine’s name in lowercase letters, and she did not ask him to be serious because names help people carry weight. The house across the street continued its neighborly hum, two blocks down a party had decided to begin early for no one reasons, and a man walking a dog pretended not to notice two unmarked cars and a van that was trying to sit in a way that did not draw attention to its antennas. The warrant had arrived like a reluctant relative in the middle of a long weekend. It was signed. It had a feel to it. You can develop a taste for paper that gives you permission, which is a vice like any other.

They went in with ceremony. Courtesy had failed last time, and even if it had not, they would not have rehearsed it again. Catherine opened the door with that exact measure of welcome that says you have interrupted something beautiful that will forgive you, and for a moment Alondra let herself imagine their lives in reverse—what it would have been like to be the one walking the rooms, naming the light, consented to by empty air. The fantasy was a private infidelity and she let it pass. Geist was not here because Geist had a Tuesday night class and a duty to a woman whose husband had left her and the woman wanted to talk to God as if God were a union rep. She had texted Alondra that she would come after, and Alondra had sent back a reply devoid of emoji out of respect for the gravity of their adulthood.

The wall Catherine had crafted spoke nothing of its true shape to the naked eye. The camera raised its own gaze and translated. Cold is a stubborn suitor, and it leaves a color where it leans. The screen lit with a patch the size of a child’s door, a crisp rectangle that retained winter while the house rehearsed summer. The tech looked at Alondra and lifted an eyebrow because a man will always show you when a tool has worked, and she nodded because she knew that tools like to be thanked through their owners. Tirado put his hand flat against the paint even though it would tell him nothing his eyes had not, a human that still wanted to be the first instrument consulted.

“You hid a window,” Alondra said to Catherine, and Catherine’s face arranged itself into someone who receives compliment as if it makes her sad.

“I wanted to see if I could,” she replied, and if she had added a shrug it would have been ostentation. “There was a cold room in the house once. People used to keep their pickles in the floor. I liked the idea of preserving.”

The tech set the camera aside as if it were a child who had done its homework and could be trusted not to eat glue, and he took from his bag one unromantic, heavy drill with a bit that had been sharpened more times than perhaps was healthy. He looked at Alondra for the nod that would put holes into a woman’s wall and into her secrets. It took a beat longer than it might have on another block with another judge’s name on paper. Then she nodded and the drill made its small industrial life.

From inside the wall the world made a sound like a person preparing not to cry. Dust turned holy in the air because light loves nothing more than particulate. The bit met resistance and then it did not. The hole opened into a cold that wanted to speak. Tirado leaned and put his mouth near it, a boy again at the crack of a fairground’s siding, and breathed out and in, wordless on purpose. He stood back and waited like a sentry because someone had to be dignified while the rest of them performed their functions.

Catherine did not move because it would have made it worse. She thought very briefly of dropping the pretense and taking the box of truth out into the back yard and setting it ablaze and watching the neighbors come with hoses and accusations and letting it ruin their shoes. There is a genre of confession that loves birthday parties. She had never liked that genre. She liked rooms where she could hear her own pulse and decide which beat to keep. So she stood, hips on the line, hands behind her in that way that looks like compliance and is not, and she watched the hole being shaped out of her house with as much interest as she had once watched a teacher make a diagram of a heart and tell her what each section did when you loved the wrong person.

The panel swung free with a sound that registered in no grammar. Behind it, the space was tight, efficient, lined with surfaces that took insult and turned it into whispers. The chest hummed and would have been handsome in a kitchen still aspiring to wintering beets. The cloth on the rope could have been a looped towel, a spouse’s invention when someone has slippery hands. Alondra let the world condense into the square of the lid and tried to hear how it would sound if she did not already know. The tech pulled a thermometer from his bag because certain gestures are required, and he inserted it through the little gap the latch allowed and looked at the number as if it would tell his future. He said something like optimal in a voice that had been told to be brave and had learned that bravery is a quiet that arrives late.

“Step back, please,” Alondra said to Catherine, and it was a polite sentence with a small iron rail inside it. “Stand where I can see your hands.”

Catherine put her hands on the back of a chair like a woman considering soup. Her hands looked like they had been thinking for several years and would only share if you asked them questions in a language they preferred. She allowed herself a breath that was not for her lungs but for the room.

When the seal broke, the blue light lifted itself like a thing that remembered flattery. The cold came out with the righteous confidence of a person corrected and proven correct. Waxed paper reflects nothing admirable, but it reflected enough. The parcels lay with that innocuous geography people like to impose when they do not want to admit dimension. The tape with its names had the handwriting of a schoolteacher who refuses to let the world smudge her chalk. Blue Shift. Witch Hazel. Break Room. Halo. The fourth had an edge that had been newly fussed, which is to say it held time like a bead of water that will not fall until it has made you anxious.

“You’ve made a pantry,” Tirado said before his mouth remembered to shut, and the tech beside him made a child’s sharp inbreath on a day when the open refrigerator door is no longer a game. Alondra reached for the stool she had watched in another kitchen under another jurisdiction and she set it up here because rituals must be repurposed or else you die of novelty. She put on the gloves that have become the cost of modern life, and then over those another set, even though the double was more for the tradition than the science. The labels were neat and she hated them. She lifted the corner of the topmost parcel with the care of a person opening a letter from a man who has already told her he will not write again.

The face that was not a face said nothing because faces that have been sealed and kept do not owe us speech. The hand that was visible because Catherine had made sure there would be a hand visible knew them, and they knew it, and for a second the room contained a recognition more valuable than any paper. The little white comma had turned the color of water, and the nail beds were perfect in their small, suburban neatness. An officer at the door, who had not yet seen enough to be cruelly good at not reacting, made a sound that he would later attribute to dust. Alondra closed her eyes in respect and in self-defense, and when she opened them she had a list in her head that began with the words we will be careful and included the names of the technicians who would owe the dead their best labor.

In the church, the woman with the husband who had left had discovered the use of honesty as a scalpel and was cutting herself, gently, in Geist’s presence. Eva’s phone vibrated once on the edge of the desk, where it had been placed as a penitent, and she told it to wait by doing nothing. The woman spoke about love as if it were an object you could misplace and then find under the bed with a great deal of dust. She asked if her anger made her bad and Geist told her that anger is a wall you put between you and the thing that will drown you, and sometimes you need a wall before you can build a door. The woman cried with her face composed until a single muscle twitched in her cheek, and then she cried in a way teenagers recognize and adults tend to judge, and Eva passed her the cheap tissues that had been purchased without bitterness and they did their poor work as well as they were able. Only when the woman had left with the promise of a check-in did Eva pick up her phone and read the single line from Alondra, and the line said we’re in and then it said bring yourself and be ready and she stood with knees that forgot their schooling for a moment and then behaved when she told them to.

Nora Kline had not learned by experience that there is such a thing as a good knock in the night, and when the door shook beneath Alondra’s knuckles at a measured pace she knew immediately that she would be asked to sit down and then she would be asked to stand. She opened and saw a woman she had seen once on her sister’s phone during a fundraiser where marshmallows had been melted on cookies and admired as if that were culture, and she saw the collar that was a square of white pretending at simplicity, and she saw behind it a woman with hair like the promise of a storm, and she understood so exactly what this meant that her feet took her to the couch without her consent. She did not scream because screaming is a theater choice and she had been taught other techniques. She said tell me without making it beautiful, and Alondra gave her the smallest beauty she could muster and the largest truth, and Nora bowed over her own hands and said thank you like a person receiving soup, and that, too, was a sacrament.

Catherine sat on the top stair and counted backwards in a foreign language she had almost learned properly when she was nineteen. The house was breathing like a large animal and every vent became a mouth. She heard the lacquer of a radio, the sibilance of numbers spoken into air, the quiet economy of nylon moving against cotton. She thought of the studio beam and the way it had tracked her growth without comment. She imagined the vicar’s sink filling to the height where water begins to talk to metal. She pictured the gallery woman’s hands adjusting a card so that it was centered and correct while the world above it rattled its sabers. She felt, with that private spark of pleasure that will damn a person if anything will, that she had made something worth the price.

She waited for the moment when a voice would ask her whether there was anything she would like to say before she said it on paper. She did not entertain the idea of flight because flight is for people who do not invest in architecture. She pressed her palm to the stair tread and felt the grit gather to the lines of her hand. She thought of printing one final sentence where someone could see it and misunderstood it on purpose. She did not indulge herself. When the woman with the hair came to the bottom of the stairs and looked up, the distance between them was filled with the kind of silence that has already made up its mind about you.

“Ms. Glass,” Alondra said, and the name did not like being called. “We are going to ask you to come with us. We will sit you in a room that has a table I am ashamed of. You will be asked questions. Some of them will be better than others. Before that, I would like you to tell me whether Lydia Kline had a chance to say anything to anyone that we need to know.”

Catherine tilted her head as if the question had been delivered by a small bird that would not be corralled by crumbs. She kept her voice even because evenness, she had learned, is the one elegance you can wear without being accused of vulgarity. She said, “She asked me if I ever get tired,” and whatever moved across Alondra’s face then was private and perfectly visible. She added, because she had decided she would add it in this precise place to make a point only she would ever admire, “I told her I get tired of being told to be clean.”

Geist arrived with a speed that made the bishop’s sensible car look spry. The officers at the door stepped aside with that respect that has more to do with shared belief in difficult work than it does with rank. The house smelled of pine and cold and something floral that had been purchased and then used with restraint. Eva walked to the threshold of the room that had given up truth and she stopped because there are lines you do not step over until you have rehearsed your lines. Alondra came to her wearing the face of profession and the eyes of a person who has been a friend long enough to be reduced to few words. She said we found her, and Eva nodded in acknowledgment of the grammar and the fact that the verb did not include all the things it needed to. She did not ask to see the hand because she had already seen it too many times. She asked instead, “Is there someone with Nora,” and when she was told there was, she said, “Good,” in a tone that set a whole room of backs a little straighter.

It would be better if evil were uglier, the chaplain had told her once in a voice like a man who has just discovered paper cuts. It would be easier on the devout if sin would wear a costume. Catherine sat two feet from the banister with her hands visible and her face un-transfigured by anything so vulgar as contrition. She looked at the collar and held the vicar’s gaze with the interest of a person encountering an adversary worthy of her measure. You cannot arrest someone for the quality of her attention. You can arrest her for her cold.

“Friend,” Geist said, and the word stood in the air between them like a tooth. “You use it wrong.”

Catherine’s smile was without violence and full of it. She said, “So do you,” and then for the first time all evening she lowered her eyes in what looked to some like respect and to Alondra like the coiling of a rope. They took her out gently because everything in the house asked them to. She did not look back because she had already memorized the angle of the light on the stair and the color of the tech’s shoelaces and the way the officer’s hand covered his radio like a man covering a child’s ear. Outside, the street had put on the purple hour with delight. Three doors down a porch light clicked on and made a small stage of concrete. A dog who had never learned the word hush tried to learn it in a hurry and failed. Catherine went into the car like a woman entering a waiting room, which is to say with resignation and a touch of judgment for the furniture.

Reyes, later, with his coffee that was a sugar crime, would discover things in the fibers that sent him in two directions at once, both promising. The waxed paper would sing a brand’s little hymn, and the glove would tell him a size that narrowed rather than widened his net. The edges of paint on the inside lip of the frame would carry an insult the manufacturer of a solvent would identify intimately. The card stock from the gallery would admit under pressure to having been cut by a guillotine with a missing foot screw, which might sound to any other ear like a meaningless romance until you went to a print shop that had once been a wedding invitation boutique and were shown a machine with a limp.

They drove Catherine to a place where the linoleum will never die and the chairs keep secrets. Tirado sat opposite in a way that made the table look friendly. He had a sister who had once decided to become the kind of person who volunteers in a hospice and who had returned to the family with a language his mother could not bear. He looked at Catherine’s hands and tried not to hate what they had done because hatred exhausts a man and he had been sleeping badly. He asked the questions you can ask before the lawyer arrives in a skirt that could organize a nation. He said, “Why the hands,” and when she did not answer, he said, “Why the hands, Ms. Glass, when there are faces in the world,” and she said, very softly, as if the answer were a private thing she gave away as a favor, “Because faces lie and hands keep the account.”

In the gallery, the staff looked at the diptych and did what businesses do when taste becomes dangerous: they printed a new label that postponed the opening. The woman in architecture let herself sigh in the back room where the fruit had begun to look like repentance. She called three collectors and told them there was a delay because the artist had become complicated, and they answered with the expressions of men whose calendars do not move God or government but will shift a dinner if you promise them novelty later. She stood alone in the white room and allowed herself to admire an enemy appropriately. She would keep the crate. She would wrap a quote around it like ribbon and sell it to a person who could afford to pretend they did not understand. She told herself she would not dream of cold.

Geist sat at her little desk later with the collar on the lamp so the light became a square. She wrote a sermon with a pencil because she needed friction. She said what are you doing when you look, over and over in ten different ways, and she did not once use the word voyeur even though it had perched over her like a crow all evening. She told a story about a boy who had dragged a pew pencil in a soft circle on the floor and the way the circle had imposed a logic on the space that her feet obeyed long after the pencil mark had been rubbed away. She wrote about consent as if it were a muscle, and she gave it exercises the congregation could do in chairs while other people judged them. She wrote the sentence God is not a camera and then scratched it out because nonsense is sometimes a relief but never an answer. When she set the pencil down her hands smelled of cedar and graphite and the faintest ribbon of pine she had carried home in her cuffs.

Nora slept badly and woke to a message she had set before she slept, something practical like who has keys and should I water your plant and what do we do about her uniform, and she deleted it without sending because it was addressed to a future she did not want. She made coffee with a fury that would have curdled milk and then drank it cold as it dared to be. She looked at the hands in the little oil by the television and decided to keep it on the floor forever. She called her mother and they did that thing daughters and mothers do with silence: they make it into a fabric that gives the body something to press against. When she hung up, she went into the tiny bathroom with its cracked tile and she washed her hands for no reason, and when she looked down she made herself look at the lines. She waited to see if some meaning would rise out of her palms like steam, and when it did not, she dried them on a towel that had learned to be a towel by being one, and she opened the window because the room needed to understand the concept of an elsewhere.

In a different elsewhere, the forum stirred because a thread had become a nest. The phrase keep your hands clean had been learned and was now being taught to people who wanted to belong. A woman named Phebe wrote a post in which she confessed to feeling seen by someone who did not show her a face, and several people told her that was an ancient feeling and she should beware of theology disguised as applause. A man who had once been a boy who slung paint in a warehouse wrote a confession about how he liked to watch nurses because they do work he is afraid of, and he was told to sit with that until the fear put him down and then to stand. The anonymous user who had shepherded this congregation to this place wrote two sentences and deleted them and wrote two better sentences and hit send and then did nothing at all because sometimes the greatest act is restraint.

After the paperwork, after the lights, after the cup of coffee whose purpose was to distract and whose failure had become a legend in certain precincts, after the words I am not answering that and before the words I want my counsel, Catherine looked across a table at the woman with the hair and the woman with the square and chose her last sentence before the door that time. She said, “The world wanted stillness and I gave it to them,” and if anyone else had spoken that sentence it would have been misunderstood as art. As it was, it was entered into a record, and it will have a future because words do that when attended by law. Outside, a train pulled the city’s seam again, and somewhere far beyond where any of them could pretend to claim, the ocean did what it always does, which is refuse to be observed into obedience.Chapter 8

Morning in Long Beach pretended there had been no night. The streets wore their ordinary, the dog walkers carried compostable bags like amulets, and the palms rehearsed their small, graceless curtsy to a breeze that did not care. On Ocean, the storefronts blinked themselves into coherence, and in the bakery with the flaky window paint a woman dusted a tray of croissants with sugar like ash and looked at the door as if the person she wanted might choose today to come in. The air had a new cleanness that had nothing to do with weather. It came from the knowledge that something had been opened and named and taken away, a pocket of cold punctured so that the city could remember how to breathe. In a room with a window pointed toward the port, Geist sat with her knees touching the underside of a table built for meetings that had long ago decided to become, instead, a place for cups to be set down hard. The chaplain had brought her tea that tasted of bergamot and apology. On the legal pad in front of her she had written the words what we owe to the seen and underlined them with a pencil until the paper had a groove.

“We’re doing it tonight,” the chaplain said, and he sounded like a man rehearsing a psalm that wanted to be news. “Out in the garden. People will bring candles because the culture remembers how. We have a box of votives from last Advent that was meant for a pageant the children never took seriously. Nora says she’ll bring a picture. Simi wants to read something, even if no one agrees what we should read.”

“We’ll let them bring their disagreements,” Geist said. “They’re a form of attendance. What time.”

He named the hour it would be dark enough for faces to look like they wanted to be kind. He told her the hospital had sent an email to its staff reminding them of the correct name for silence. He said the administration preferred to imagine grieving in the abstract, like a painting hung on a corporate wall. He said the volunteers were making coffee for afterward as if grief could be softened by warmth, which sometimes it could. He watched her hand make notes as if the pen were a liturgy and he was only a lay reader.

“Alondra will come if she can,” Geist said, adding the name to the margin as if it were a petition. “She said the word inventory as if it might carry a body out of a room without making a spectacle. I told her I would speak for exactly long enough and no more. I have used exactly long enough as a weapon. I am trying now to use it as a mercy.”

“They will ask you to give them an answer,” he said. “You can give them the question and call it a kind of faith.”

In the precinct where the air smelled of an ancient, immovable coffee filter and a recent fight between printer and man, Alondra had made a stack and anchored it with a paperweight a retiree had left behind with the note so you don’t fly away. Reyes was on the phone with a supplier who spoke about solvents the way other men speak about cars, and he held the receiver to his ear with his shoulder, his hands performing a small ballet of nothing over the desk while he listened. The gloves had become a vector; the waxed paper, a hymn. The pine detergent was the sort of brand a woman buys when she cannot bear the cloy of the more popular choices, its label designed by someone with a preference for rectangular fonts. A receipt with a time stamp had married a parking camera still from the alley behind the gallery, and now the staging company’s gray pickup made its sober way across their map on paper and again on the back of her eyelids when she closed them too long.

“We have a unit,” Tirado said from her doorway, and he held up a set of forms that looked tired already. “Staging company keeps overflow in a public storage near the river. The manager says they share the space with creatives, which is what he calls men with bands and women with hand-lettered calendars. The camera there stutters when it rains. It rained last Thursday for exactly eight minutes.”

“Of course it did,” Alondra said, and she stood and felt the small graceful crunch of her spine. “Get me the footage either side of the stutter. Get me the log of keypad entries. There is a child somewhere who can pull a code from a greasy film on a door; hire him if his mother will let him. I want the door open before lunch.”

“She has counsel,” Reyes murmured, covering the mouthpiece. “Counsel wears a neat bob and a skirt that could make a senator confess he once cheated at chess. She wants to make the argument that the art is commentary.”

“Counsel can make any argument she likes once I have a list that begins with the number of dead,” Alondra said. “Until then, tell her that commentary ceases to be protected when it keeps a hand from holding a woman’s face while she breathes.”

Down the hall, behind the two-way glass that ensured everyone knew who owned the gaze in that room, Catherine sat with the composed petulance of a dancer in a chair too low for her legs. The cuffs were off because counsel had arrived and declared them vulgar this early, and because Catherine had agreed to become an object for a few minutes if it meant the conversation would become more interesting. She had a scrap of paper the size of a fortune from a cookie, sanctioned by the lawyer as a place to put a thought. On it, with a blue pen someone had not realized would be meaningful, she had written a handful of words: halo, bond, proof, left. In her right palm, the imprint of the pen had made a ghost. She liked the way ink makes a writer of a hand whether or not the head has been invited.

“You should stop talking,” the lawyer said, her voice the precise pitch of somebody who has learned that politeness is a tool, not a principle. “That is the single most sensible thing you can do for yourself right now.”

“I never talk,” Catherine said, which was one of the many lies that had chosen to live with her because they liked the light in her house. “I arrange. Sometimes arrangement looks like speech, to people who prefer sound to sense.”

The lawyer stared at her as if the distance between them could be stapled into something that would hold. She put a bottle of water on the table the way nurses put things within reach to quiet a body. “Stop arranging,” she said. “At least until I can convince them you are an artist and not a taste for cold.”

Catherine sipped, because the mouth requires occupations. Her eyes flicked up to the glass where she knew a man or a woman or sometimes both would stand and watch, cosmically pronated. She pictured the vicar on the other side instead, which made her smile with that small, ugly joy that had been her sweet tooth since she was a child and figured out that if she told the truth in certain ways adults became lost. She filed the word proof where it would be found by someone who had learned to live on the crumbs of structure, and she waited.

At the storage facility, where the rows of orange doors made the late morning look like a diagram of safety, the manager’s hair was gelled into a civic posture. He wanted to be helpful because one day, in a story his ex-wife would tell herself at a polite table, he could say so. He produced a ring of keys with drama and regret for the keypad’s egalitarian indifference. He waved his arm as if ushering a cruise ship through a narrow channel and led them down an aisle that smelled of cardboard that had lived in air for too long. The cameras had caught rain and then a smear of gray like thumb across a lens and then clarity again; the keycode log did what all keycode logs do: told the truth in a way that required translation.

“She took it twice last week,” Tirado said, finger moving down the sheet like a priest blessing a pew row by row. “Five A.M. and dusk, the respectable times for trouble. No security officer on site because why pay a man to lock the same door twice a night. The unit is…” He squinted at the fine print because he refused to wear the glasses his mother told him would look handsome. “Unit B-12. The price point is…let’s call it aspirational.”

Alondra put on the gloves because ritual comforts even those who never admit it. The door rattled the way tin does when it knows you are performing on it. The latch gave with a capitulation she disliked. The space had the ordinary stage of creativity: crates stacked with the precision of roadies and the abandonment of children who believe in immortality, shirts on hangers with masking tape labels that read clean and used, a bank of lights sleeping in road cases, a dolly that had carried more possibility than the men who had pushed it. Along the back wall sat a chest freezer that wore its cord like a snake ashamed. There were two coolers stacked beside it in a harmony of shape that offended her, and a plastic tub with a lid bowed slightly under weight. On the tub, someone had placed a rectangle of tape and written a single word in that schoolteacher hand. Proof.

Reyes, who had followed because his curiosity had bullied his respect for chain of custody into the trunk, knelt at the cooler and touched the lid. The blue of the tape made him angry like a certain blue always had; he had a story about a bicycle and a neighbor that he never told because it was not art, just hurt. He lifted the lid and found inside a taxidermy of domesticity: bags of ice melted to a few cold diamonds, a towel folded to take up volume, a spool of cotton tape, a cheap metronome in a plastic shell ticking a slow measure. He lifted the metronome with two fingers and raised a brow at no one in particular.

“She times herself,” he said. “She times her cold. She times whoever helps.”

Alondra went to the chest freezer because it was unimaginative and therefore hers. The plug trailed where someone had disengaged it in a hurry. She laid her hand on the lid and felt, to her deep unease, a tenderness of cold rather than a violence of it. She opened it and found what a person might find if a restaurant went uninspected for a season: packages, yes, but here they were empty, pliant in their waxed paper skins, shaped by hands that cared about edges more than they cared about anything else. On the inside of the lid, taped by a woman who liked to write notes for and to herself, was a list: bleach, chalk, tide, tape, proof. The handwriting did a small dance on the P like whoever had written had taught herself to be whimsical for an audience of one.

“Proof of life,” Tirado said quietly, because the phrase had already put the words in his mouth. “Or proof of life as a joke you make in a room like this when the only people who will hear it are the ones who laugh when no one is watching.”

“The packaging is rehearsal,” Alondra said, closing the lid with two hands the way you lower a child into a crib when you no longer believe in sleep. “She was preparing this space for next. She had nexts built into her calendar. The arrest moved next.”

There was a second tub, unmarked. Inside, meticulous in its banality, lay supplies: boxes of gloves, rolls of plastic wrap, two bars of the cedar soap that lied, a bottle of the square-shouldered pine. There was a baggie with chalk, the blue used by tailors to leave faint instruction on cloth. Reyes held the chalk to the light and it admitted it had been used to mark lines on something that had not wanted to absorb it. He pictured an edge of paper pressed to fabric, an address drawn for hands that refused to get lost.

“Someone helped lift,” he said. “The lid of that chest isn’t a one-hand job with something in it. She’s small. She’s clever. She’s not an octopus. She needed a second. The unit is in the staging company’s name. Who has their code. Who has her code. Who receives her messages when she decides to stop using her own throat.”

The forum did not like silence; it brought out the worst in the people who pretended to love emptiness. Phebe saw the thread glare at her with its unread count and put her phone face down under a dish towel like a beetle she was not ready to kill. Her apartment smelled of cumin because she had tried to cook for comfort and discovered again that comfort requires practice. She had not slept. The world she wrote inside had been her tiny chapel and now the priest had turned monstrous and the congregation sounded offended by their own gullibility. There was a new user with the kind of ease you get when you have three years of practice, and the new user said things like tribute and misread and you should never apologize for evidence, and Phebe told herself that she would not answer because answering is how you give away your breath.

Her phone vibrated once on the counter. She lifted the towel like a magician and looked. The word friend sat there, lone as a prayer you don’t believe in, and she nearly threw the device into the sink and turned the water on. Instead she answered because her loneliness is a seducer with ten faces. She wrote who are you and the reply came back with a photograph of a hand she did not know—older, rougher, a man’s with the knuckles scabbed by stubbornness—and the words the work is not done. Her answer formed in the part of her that had been turned into a weapon by thread after thread: whose work, whose hands, what do you need. The reply came with an address not far from the river and a time that made her late for everything that kept her alive. She felt the shame bloom and tried to treat it as a bruise, massaging it with logic. She put on her shoes and did not tell anyone because telling would require her to admit how much she wanted to believe she had been chosen.

Mara did not keep to her mother’s rules because most of her mother’s rules were not designed for daughters but parishioners. She had extra rules of her own that she wore like earrings. One said do not tell a secret that belongs to someone else. Another said do not make a joke out of a person who cries. A third said if a message from a stranger uses a word you know belongs to a game they will not let you win, show it to someone who loves you. She held her phone like a mouse and brought it to Brian in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, where he had surrendered to a paint color he despised and now complimented it to keep the house from sulking. He read the word friend on her screen and looked not yet afraid and extremely offended.

“We give that word away like pens at a bank,” he said. “I would like to prosecute people for punning with it. Does your mother know.”

“She always knows,” Mara said, which was a cheat and a prayer at once. “But also no. She is busy with a woman who is broken in the middle of her life and the middle of her kitchen floor. I thought I would bring her something solved rather than something that wants to become cubic.”

Brian breathed through his nose, ran a string of thought behind his eyes, and then called Geist without asking permission because he had paid for that right when he agreed to two summers of camp she had picked and two winters of socks she refused to wear. When Eva answered, he spoke in the particular politeness a person uses with someone they love and will hold responsible for nothing. He said we have a friend and she said no you don’t and he said exactly, and within a few minutes she was at his door with her jacket unbuttoned and her jaw set, which in his experience meant that she was about to behave with exemplary decorum for exactly as long as necessary before she became a problem for someone else.

“This is bait,” Eva said, reading the message and the time and the place, her finger driving a patient circle around the parts that mattered. “It could be a trap for a trap. Either way, it says me. It says you. It says nurses. It says river. It says late. We will not go. We will send others.”

“Define others,” Mara said, and the crispness of her tone warmed Eva more than coffee could.

“People with radios and the law behind their throat,” Eva said. “People who owe me enough to let me speak over their shoulders. We will be present the way weather is present. We will not get wet.”

Alondra met them outside the station with a calm that had been packed for travel. She had brought Tirado and two uniformed officers whose faces were in that stage of their career where they have not yet learned to tell fear and excitement apart. She took Mara’s phone and photographed the message and the thread that came before and after, glancing at the handles, the grammar, the tells that had become her vernacular. She saw Phebe’s call-and-response with a stranger and thought of altar rails and the old wisdom that certain forms of worship are only distance pretending. She keyed the address into a map and watched it curl toward the river like the language of people who don’t believe in maps.

The storage facility and the river, cousins in a city that stores and ships its sins, were only blocks apart. The address in the message belonged to a warehouse that had been a warehouse all its life and resented the idea of a loft being squeezed out of it. Its windows were patina and prejudice. A door at street level had been painted the kind of blue architects think will soothe men and always fails. They approached with the posture of people who might be asking for directions, and Alondra told herself the joke about bananas and gorillas she always told herself before a door and wished her old partner were here to roll his eyes.

Phebe had waited, small as her will, across the street in the wrap of a hoodie she was too old for. When the unmarked cars coasted into place and the uniforms lifted their hands to their shoulder mics and the woman with the hair swept her gaze across the block like water, Phebe did not run. She felt ridiculous because her bag was full of muffins. She had brought muffins because her grandmother had been a church woman and when a woman from a church calls you friend you bring something with sugar in it and the demand for coffee. She was not stupid. She was instead something soft that the world had learned to chew. Alondra saw her and saw, for a heartbeat, the child she might have been, and she scanned the doors and windows and the roofline for the person who had told Phebe where to stand. Then, on the fire escape, a figure stepped into being like a trick of the light, hood up, shoulders square, a posture you learn in hospitals if you do not want to be touched by strange opinions.

“Do not move,” Alondra said into her mic, as if the command could be distributed with oxygen. “Let him declare himself.”

He declared by opening his hands. He declared by holding nothing and showing nothing, a street theology. He declared like a man who has never considered that being in a story implies an ending. He said, loudly enough to be heard by a person who wanted to, “You took her too soon,” and the phrasing made him instantly familiar to Alondra: she knew men who had loved the women who hurt them, because the hurt had given them a costume. He started down the stairs with the fervor of someone who has memorized a speech and is late delivering it. He got three steps and then saw the uniforms gather and stopped, because he was not brave, only convinced.

“Jasper,” Phebe said in a voice that surprised her with its own contempt. “You run the thread about scrubs being hedonistic. Your dog is named after a whiskey. You think women owe you narratives. Don’t come down here and use her name like a handbag.”

Jasper—if that was his present truth—flinched, caught between the demands of his audience and the new geometry of the street. He held up his phone like a flag. The screen showed the same word, friend, and a line beneath it that read we must complete the circle. Alondra did not look at the phone because there is only so much you can allow someone else’s ritual to draw you in. She gave the officers a small slice of her attention and the hand signal she had learned on a range in a desert she had never wanted to see, and they moved with the competence good training confers. It took ten seconds and Jasper made a sound like a man interrupted on his way to ruin; he dropped to a knee in a theater he had waited years to book and was rewarded by no one. Phebe stood still and let a cop wrap her in nothing that promised safety and everything that smelled like men’s deodorant. She cried, not from fear, but from the recognition of how easily she had prepared herself to be harmed by anyone calling the harm an idea.

“Second,” Tirado said in Alondra’s ear. He was two doors down at the alley mouth, eyes on a shadow that did not want to be caught but had not planned for other people to have keys to other doors. “Movement. Gloves. Bag. If it isn’t her next, it’s someone’s. On your go.”

Alondra held her hand the way a conductor holds a fermata. She had learned that pause is weapon and prayer both. The alley smelled of mildew and a sweetness that belonged to fruit that should have been cut yesterday. The shadow shaped itself into a woman with a cap and soft socks. The socks were what convinced her. Men who think they are invisible wear the wrong shoes. Women who wish to disappear know better. This one carried a duffel with a length that had its own argument, and she moved like someone who has done this repeatedly enough to be bored. Alondra stepped out and used her posture as a tool, and the woman almost smiled because she had finally been recognized as a person who works.

“Hands,” Alondra said, and the woman showed them, palm lines full of chalk. The cap said a company that rents chairs for weddings. The duffel said dead weight. The woman’s mouth said admiration aimed toward a person not present.

“Catherine has taste,” she said, as if reciting a line from a favorite poem. “You have to admit the composition. Everyone has to admit the composition.”

Alondra vomited a laugh because there is nowhere in the academy where they teach you how to survive reverence. “You really don’t want to continue this sentence,” she said. “If you are lucky, you will learn how to use the past tense about yourself.”

The duffel held not a hand but the kit for making hands into statements: the gloves, the tape, the pine, the cord tied with that knot that holds but can be persuaded. Reyes would later call it hospitality with a knife in it. The woman had a phone with messages that placed her at the house on nights when the freezer asked for attention, and notes from an account with a name that had probably never belonged to a human baby. She had, in the zip pocket, a clipping from a gallery card, the edge worn by a thumb that had learned prayer late in life. When they put her in the back of the car, she looked satisfied because she had become part of the art, which is to say she had entered the story she believed it told about her.

Geist stood in the hospital garden and discovered she could hate an hour. The light wandered like someone tired of their own show. Faces arranged themselves for candlelight the way people learn to put on their kindness for church. She took the microphone and did not speak into it because amplification would have insulted the dark. She spoke to a room that had no walls. She told them that looking could be a kind of work if we chose it to be, and that work was not an alibi but a choice. She said Lydia’s name clearly and Nora’s, too, and the names of three other nurses in the front row who had not tried to leave their shifts early even when the air in the lounge had become poisonous. She said that hands do not have to be clean to do good; they have to be honest. She said that if she had ever given anyone the impression that rules are best obeyed when they are pretty, she begged their pardon now. She did not say God is not a camera, because she had learned how to refrain, and the congregation loved her for it even if they did not know why.

After, Simi read a poem about the way needles are neutral and people are not, and someone behind her said amen in a tone that declared it had learned the rhythm of the word from a different tradition and wanted to be tested on it. The candles in their little plastic cups made a lake of light, and the chaplain moved among it like a man who has forgiven himself for not being able to cool everything. Nora clutched her sister’s picture the way a person holds a protest sign when the slogan is her own name. Mara stood with Brian and did not touch his hand and did not let go of herself. On Geist’s phone, face down in her pocket, a text from Alondra had nested, a sentence that said we have more and we will find the rest and set to the task the people who have the stomach for it.

Catherine’s cell had been painted the color of indifference, which some bureaucrat had decided would calm the housed. The bed had the right number of bolts and the wrong number of blankets. The woman across the hall snored like a rhythm section. Catherine lay with one forearm across her eyes and let the afterimage of light become ladder rungs and then disappear. She did not dream because she had learned how to bite that particular animal behind the neck and hold until it stilled. She thought of the vicar speaking into a darkness and did the unthinkable: she was careful not to imagine the words. Words had always been her other brush, and she would not grant them now unless she was certain the stroke would land where she meant it to. In the morning, she knew, someone would put paper on the table and ask her to choose a shape for her future. She had already chosen the word proof and given it to them, and she suspected the vicar would know what to do with it.

The next day folded itself into its cousins. The lab revealed in the chalk the signature of a tailor who had been interviewed once in a story about bridesmaid dresses and had said if it doesn’t fit we will make it fit like a prayer. The rope from the duffel spoke a knot’s dialect that a sailor had taught his child who had taught a lover who had not let herself love but had learned the knot anyway. The solvent between the layers of paint named a shop three blocks from Catherine’s house where a man with square hands had given her a discount because she had asked as if she were embarrassed to ask. Reyes carried a plastic bag with a formality that had nothing to do with law and texted Alondra a picture of two small fibers that looked, under the microscope, like the skeleton of a moth’s wing. He insisted they meant something because this was a day when insisting meant survival.

At noon, Eva visited Nora with a container of soup despite having promised herself she would stop using food as strategy. They ate on the floor because the table annoyed them. They did not pretend to talk about television shows as a cultural language. Nora asked how one lives with rage that keeps learning new ways to present itself. Eva answered in the only way she knew: you teach it manners and then you let it out in a controlled environment and you do not apologize for its existence. When she left, she asked if she could take the little oil of hands by the television and for the first time since they met Nora laughed like a person whose insides had not been hollowed like furniture. “Please,” she said. “Teach it something.”

Near the river, the warehouse yielded more quiet than noise. In a locker in the far corner of a room made of corners, Alondra found a box of photographs. They had been printed at a pharmacy by someone who had lived long enough to remember that film has a body. They were of hands. Not Catherine’s hands; these were the hands of people who had sent messages and had wanted their generosity recorded. Hands passing coffee. Hands holding receipts. Hands putting coins into jar. Hands on steering wheels. Hands in pockets. Hands guilty of nothing except existing. On the back of each, in that neat print that did not know how to express the possibility of being wrong, someone had written dates and times. Sometimes, instead of a title, a name: Phebe. Julia. Simi. Eva. Alondra put each one back into the box with the care she reserves for detonators. She did not take the one with her name. She knew better than to carry herself home.

That night, as Long Beach tried again to put its palm fronds to sleep and the suck at the river mouth tried to convince the water to behave, the forums did what forums do when a deity falls: they crowned themselves new ones. Some wrote elegies for courage that had only ever disguised harm. Some wrote fury against a woman who had given them an aesthetic that now felt dangerous to their credos. A few wrote with humility and therefore did not get shared. Phebe went to bed without reading them and woke at three because her roommate opened a cupboard wrong. She sat at the small table by the window and looked at her hands and tried to decide what they knew. She laid a pen on her palm and wrote three words that had never been true and now wanted to be: I am clean. In the morning she would get soap under her nails and scrub not as penance but because she had work, and the world would require her to touch its ordinary.

Catherine did not speak in court when it would have been decorative. The bond hearing was a performance in a room that hated theater. The lawyer wore the severity of someone at a funeral where the dead had not been loved. The gallery woman sat three rows back with her architecture softened and her hands clasped as if she had been taught to do that as a child and had remembered too late. Nora did not come because it would have required her to be angry in front of people who would make sport of it. Geist did, because she had made a bargain with her own impulses to attend even when attendance made her stomach argue with itself. The judge spoke about danger and community and evidence in the measured key of civic lullabies. When they asked Catherine whether she understood, she said yes as if she was agreeing to a haircut. As she was led away, she turned her head and let her eye fall on the collar at Eva’s throat like a question tossed into a quiet bay. Eva’s face did what it had learned to do in rooms with power and sharp edges: it stayed. She looked at Alondra, and the glance between them did what it always does, which is lay a plank over water.

Afterward, outside, the light decided to be kind to no one. Reporters trimmed their sentences to fit the news. A woman with a sign that said hands off had not considered its irony and smiled when the camera found her. The chaplain arrived late and stood three feet from Geist and said nothing because it was his art. When he did speak, it was to ask whether grief could be persuaded to stop wrapping itself in aesthetics. She answered that everything wraps itself in something or other; what matters is whether we acknowledge the cloth. He offered her a mint as if it were a liturgical object and she took it because communion arrives in many forms.

That evening in the studio that would not be entered again by its maker, a thin line of dust settled along the beam Catherine had loved for its spine. In the basement, the hum ceased because a man had pulled a plug with his gloved hand and written down the time. In a small rented unit near the river, a metronome ticked itself to silence. On a break room bulletin board at St. Danae’s, someone wrote with a marker that had to be pressed too hard to function: keep your hands. They had left out the word clean not by error but by resolve. And in a kitchen where a woman had washed her hands so often they had become anxious, a vicar held a little oil painting by the sides and taught it how to be looked at without being devoured.Chapter 10

Reyes had learned to stand as if nothing in the room required worship. It kept him from giving in to the habit of reverence that laboratories breed when they begin to believe in their own accuracy. The hands lay as they had been made to lie, inside the names the painter had given them and the bags the state required. Witch Hazel had yielded prints from three fingers that agreed to tell their stories with a prompt dignity; one matched a woman in her sixties who had been a nurse aide and had renewed her notary commission as if that would keep the world from getting away with its worst behavior. Break Room carried the elegant imprecision of a wedding ring's shadow on skin—she had never worn one, it turned out, but the ring her mother had given her at graduation had made a shallow groove that gold would have made deeper. Halo had no prints at all and the skin had been treated with something that presented itself as kindness and was not; a lotion from the expensive end of a drugstore shelf, chosen by someone who knew exactly which bottle a woman buys when she intends to reward herself without explanation. Reyes wrote it down without scorn. The fourth, with its tape labeled Proof of Life, had been done later, and the cloth had a stiffness along the edges that belonged to a new box sliced open. In it, a hand that belonged to no database waited with its palm upturned, the blue beneath crawling forward as it always would. He thought briefly of his grandmother’s kitchen, where she had doused everything in vinegar and called it science, and he hated himself for the association, for the way memory insists on making tables into altars.

Alondra stood with her shoulder to the edge of his bench and made a list on a legal pad that had belonged, judging from the color, to a station that had not yet given in to the convenience of electronic forms. Witch Hazel was identified and a pair of daughters were called first and then a widower who had learned, after his wife left him during Reagan, to iron his own shirts without complaint. Break Room was a woman whose sister had become tired of writing about her as if she were a set of habits and had chosen silence instead; now she spoke and did not stop until her mouth asked for water. Halo would take longer; it is always someone whose phone plan is cheap and whose landlord has stopped forwarding mail that makes the identification take days. The Proof of Life hand had a small scar along the base of the thumb that looked like the result of a can lid that had leapt up and cut because it wants to be an animal; the scar had been kept clean and uninterested in keloid, and Reyes loved it for its maturity. He told himself love is not a word that belongs in a report, and he crossed it out in his own head and replaced it with observed.

Geist took the young woman with the muffins into her office and closed the door not because the world should be held out but because the room needed to consecrate itself. Phebe sat in the chair where men bigger than she had sat and offered the same posture of abashed obedience; it is a trick of authority that it makes as many disciples as it does rebels, and Eva had learned to forgive it. On the bag between them, the tops of the muffins had cracked into that precise grammar of sugar, a sign of competence if not genius. Phebe kept her hands on her knees as if they belonged to someone else she was trying not to alarm.

“You brought me a sentence,” Eva said, warm but refusing to pet, and Phebe nodded as if she had surrendered the subject of herself for grading.

“They said friend,” Phebe answered, and her mouth made the line of a person who understands that the word is not neutral. “They said circle. They were like her. They spoke like they wanted me to be good at what they wanted. I thought if I did something first, if I came here first, I would have done a brave thing. I am always late to brave things. I thought muffins might make the timing better. It is not funny.”

“It is not funny,” Eva agreed, and because it was rude to ignore any gift given with your name under it, she tore a muffin in half and made an altar out of paper. “Someone used the language of care as if it were a collar. That is not your first time seeing it. It is simply the first time we have a name to set under the sentence. That will make you angry, then ashamed for having been angry, then angry again because you know the shame is performative and you would like to be done performing for people who have not paid admission.”

Phebe laughed without pleasure and looked at her hands the way a person looks at a map for the road that will finally take them home. “I wanted to be in the room,” she said. “I hate how much I wanted it. It felt like a story you get to trade for attention. If I had gone and no one had come, I would have hated myself for how little I mattered. When they did come and they were police, I hated myself for being relieved. What kind of person wants to be rescued from her own plot.”

“The kind we take in on Tuesdays and Thursdays,” Eva said. “The kind who has done so much work for other people’s feelings that she cannot lift anything of her own without thinking she is shoplifting. You do not owe anyone a better version of yourself right now. Drink water. Decline to respond to men who call you friend. Ask someone else to read your messages for a week and let them make the decision about which words are allowed into your body. If you want me to be one of those someones, I will be good and ungentle.”

Phebe reached for the cup because obedience is easier when you are exhausted. “Do you ever look at your hands and wonder if they are the wrong instrument,” she asked. “Like you have been learning the piano and what you really needed was a wrench.”

“Every day,” Eva said, and she pulled the little oil of hands from her bag and set it on the desk where it could be observed. She told Phebe, briefly, about the woman who had this made for her sister as if hands could be argued into piety. “I am teaching this to be looked at without being devoured,” she added. “It is my most ambitious project.”

The woman from the staging company had the unhelpful name of Jackie—neither sufficiently common to disappear nor sufficiently uncommon to prove anything, one of those name-badges the city issues to women who lift for a living and would prefer not to be noticed. She had come to the warehouse in soft socks because rubber squeaks on concrete and softness makes less story. She had been discovered with the duffel like a child found with a hand inside a jar, and when Alondra asked her what she had expected to happen next, she said, with an irritation that belonged to certain capable people, “Well, not you,” which in its own way was a confession. She sat under a strip of fluorescent that forced the world into exactly two categories and refused to let her tear a napkin. She had a bruise on the inside of her elbow that had nothing to do with needles and everything to do with a cooler lid that resisted. Her phone had the directness of a servant; it offered up its conversations to the warrant like a child repeats a rhyme to be told he is adorable. There were messages about chairs and light truss and budgets and, buried in their midst as if words might become invisible in the presence of numbers, a thread from an account that did not commit to gender, asking for help with heavy lifting at odd hours and offering cash and the word art as if that absolved weight.

“Why the socks,” Tirado asked, because he had been a boy who ran in stocking feet in a house that creaked, and he could not bear that particular intimacy being sold for this. Jackie shrugged without apology.

“I hate the squeak,” she said. “It wakes up a whole building. She hated it, too. She had rules about sound and I liked learning rules where if you followed them the work was easier. I didn’t touch what she touched. I didn’t look too long. If you want me to be sorry, everybody is sorry in the same words. Pick yours and I will say them. You’ll still call me something I’ll have to wear for years and that’s fine; I have a back for that.”

“She paid you,” Alondra said, and Jackie nodded, the obvious requiring confirmation.

“She paid cash with edges. She was polite. She did not like my perfume and told me not to wear it if I came back after midnight. She liked that my hands didn’t shake when I held a corner. She asked me once if my mother taught me how to iron and I said no, I taught myself because my mother taught me nothing and then left. She told me I would do fine if I kept liking tools better than people.”

“Do you,” Alondra said, and Jackie looked at her as if the question had been category error itself and then smiled in a way that declared an answer: sometimes.

The painter’s gallery did what galleries do during scandal: it hosted a panel about the ethics of depiction. The woman with the scaffolded hair sent invitations with sentences about discourse that would have been better as silence and called it courage to host strangers in a white room where the paint had only just learned to forgive the last hole drilled into it. They asked an academic who had written a book about the gaze and had pictures of herself on the back cover that looked away with intelligence, and they asked a collector who liked to think of himself as a midwife and did not realize how offensive that metaphor had become, and they asked Geist because the city has a limited imagination when it comes to public confession. Eva wore a dress she had mended herself because she liked the feel of its stitches and would need reminding that hands make. She stood behind the microphone and did not let it elevate her. The room filled itself with eager faces that desired to come out knowing what to say when the subject arose next at dinner.

The academic spoke first about surveillance and tenderness, the collector about intent and gift. When it was Eva’s turn she said what she had written for herself on a card in pencil so light she had to force herself to commit to each letter: Please practice withholding. Please practice asking and then waiting. Please practice walking away. She did not speak about Catherine as if she were a symbol, because the urge to turn a woman into a parable when the woman has done violence to bodies is a way of letting the city off the hook for not having to listen to the words the woman despised and used anyway. When a man in the second row whose shirt made him look like the idea of vacation asked whether art had a responsibility to be moral, she said no, art has a responsibility to be honest; the moral belongs to the human who made it and the humans who stand beneath it. The collector made a face that declared boredom with virtue and the academic smiled the way women do when you say something that is not perfect and do not apologize for imperfection.

At county, Catherine had learned exactly two names because names make you visible, and visible is a word that sees you to the bone. The woman across the hall who snored was called Particular by everyone who knew her, which meant they did not know her at all. The guard who moved like a person dancing with an invisible partner was called Tanya by the one prisoner who had known her once before uniforms. She did not care to learn more. A letter came addressed to her under her own name and also under a name she had once used when she wanted to buy a solvent in bulk without explaining why, and she amused herself by imagining the inside of the envelope—a fan letter from someone who liked to worship with danger as an organist. The lawyer delivered it and then put her hand on the table and said not now, and Catherine smiled because it was nice to be managed by a professional. She thought of proofs: geometry in ninth grade until a teacher’s hand on her wrist had traced a triangle and she had been forced to figure out if her hatred belonged to men or to touch; the proof a photograph offers when it says look, I was there, even if the person who took it was a liar; the proof a body requires to believe it has not been abandoned. She had written the word on her palm in pen and the shower had made it bleed into her lifeline, and she found the image vulgar and twice.

The keycode log at the storage facility had only ever wanted to be helpful. It recorded entries like prayers, a litany of numbers attached to dates and times, and when Reyes ran it against the pickup’s movements and the rain and the camera’s eight-minute blunder, it became almost chatty. Two codes belonged to the staging company office and had been distributed to men who smoked where the signs asked them to be aspirational. One code had been generated the day before Catherine’s last delivery and belonged to a person who had filled out the rental form with a handwriting that had been taught by a Catholic school teacher who had made left-handed children write right-handed until they tilted; it belonged to Jackie. There was a fourth code that had only ever been used twice at odd hours and then never again. It included in its digits a little joke—a palindrome that a certain kind of person enjoys when they think no one else is watching—that Catherine would have liked and probably had insisted upon and then laughed at herself for insisting. They tracked the origin of that fourth code to a kiosk manned on Tuesdays by a boy who had practiced his signature in spiral notebooks and told his friends to call him Jax when his mother was not listening. He remembered Catherine because she had said the word storage as if it were a catechism and had waited for him to make a mistake with such patience that he had not. He remembered she wore her cap pulled low and that she had thanked him at a volume that requested no response.

Nora had to pick songs, which seemed indecent. A social worker had been assigned to the family with the soft competence of a woman who had done this during a pandemic and had learned what grief in bulk does to piety. Nora sat at the table whose leg had been propped by a paperback written in a language she could not read and scribbled a list: songs Lydia hated because they blamed women in minor keys, songs Lydia pretended to love because the chorus was a good bar for dancing, one hymn they both used to sing because their grandmother would close her eyes and lean during the refrain. She wrote down the hymn and made a face at herself and then wrote down that it was allowed to be simple right now. Eva came and did not make the mistake of reaching for the pencil. They made the list and said out loud to the empty room that Lydia had always wanted to be cremated and had laughed at the idea of anyone spending good money on a box that would be put in the ground where a child could shoot fireworks over it without meaning to be disrespectful. At the end of the list Nora added a line that made her cry despite herself, a sentence that had to do with what Lydia would not have wanted anyone to say about her hands. They took the pencil and put it down like a hot thing then, and they stopped.

The boys who run forums like boys run kites in a field of trees lessened their velocity in the week that followed. The accounts that had been hungry for instruction began to ask permission like teenagers and that alone would have made Phebe furious if she had not been so tired by relief. A woman with the handle SisterFuel—the kind of private joke that in happier times would have made a nurse roll her eyes in gratitude—posted a list of state hotlines for stalking and cyber-harassment and pinned it to the top of the thread like a sullen scripture. There were fewer pictures. There were more words about work that did not lend itself to looking. Catherine’s last draft, a meditation on attention, sat unsent in a cloud, and when eventually a moderator came across it with the weary curiosity of an overworked god, she deleted it and did not tell anyone because sometimes mercy is an act of silence.

At three in the morning, when all good policy is written and none of it implemented, Alondra drove past the gallery on purpose and made herself imagine it open again. The walls painted over, the holes patched, the corners wiped with vinegar because it makes the air believe in clean without actually having achieved it. The woman at the desk arranging cards for a new show where no hands were visible because artists are sentimental like the rest of us and also, when we are called upon to behave, vindictive. She imagined the donors returning like men to a barber who had learned to cut a new way. She did not blame them for wanting to stand in white rooms. There are worse crimes than loving single-purpose spaces. She was less kind to the ambition beneath their love, but that was a separate relationship. She parked and thought of the box of photographs in the locker by the river, of her own hands captured as if the camera were a witness and not a weapon. She considered, briefly, going to stand in front of a window as if she were a picture herself and then dismissed the impulse as melodrama. She was allowed melodrama once a year, and she saved it for funerals that had too few attendees.

When Eva returned to the small painting of hands, she realized that the habit of looking had changed for her; she had practiced it so hard lately that she could not now stop. She set the oil against a stack of hymnals on her kitchen table and looked until she began to hate it and then reminded herself that hatred is the first rest stop on the way to understanding. The light on the varnish made a small window of everything, and she thought, for a moment, of inviting the chaplain and Simi and Nora to sit together and look at it with her the way people used to look at icons when their churches were warm enough to hold breath. She did not do it because the calendar, however much she disbelieved in its tyranny, was full. She took the painting back to Nora instead and asked if they could set it on the floor where it had been and teach it to live simply in a room again.

“You can keep it,” Nora said, surprising herself with how kindly she could pronounce the word keep. “I think Lydia will come get it if she wants it. She won’t want it. She’s busy. Whoever she is now, she’s busy. If God is not a camera, like you told your people, then maybe he is bad at portraits. Maybe he paints the room she’s in and the hands of whoever she has decided to love more than once today, and he leaves her face out because she asked him to. Let him.”

The second accomplice—a man with a van whose floor had learned to bear weight from theater scenery and heavy sofas and once five sacks of rice that a cousin had bought in a panic during a hurricane rumor—showed up at the station by accident. He had come to retrieve the van after his partner had been held overnight for expired tags and the van had been towed. He walked into a rare confluence of competence and paper and left his name at a window where a clerk with hair she had not had time to put up translated it into a notice on Alondra’s desk. His name was Matthew, which has been used by both saints and treasurers, and he was neither. He had calluses that told the story of rope and not the story of love, and his phone held messages from the same un-gendered account that had paid Jackie. His case was simpler and uglier than Jackie’s; he had known he was helping take something wrong, and he had decided the wrong belonged to someone else. When Alondra asked him what he thought the packages were, he said meat, and she liked him less for the cowardice of the euphemism than for its stupidity. She put him in a room painted the color of compromise and went to write the notes that make men pay for calling their work heavy lifting when it is, in fact, harm.

On a Sunday that had the air of a room someone had just left after turning out the light, they buried as much as could be buried. The hospital sent lilies and daffodils because spring is a language even the tired can speak. The bishop wore the stole with the doves on it because he liked to imagine a dove is a bird that delivers mercy and not the mess in the park, and because his wife had embroidered it and it made his shoulders square themselves in a way his tailor could no longer be asked to achieve. Eva preached the short sermon she had taught her mouth to hold, and she did not say hands once. Simi read a line of Whitman and then a line from a manual that had been handed down the hall at St. Danae’s until it fell apart: verify and then trust. Nora stood where Ness of a crowd had made space without being asked and listened for the laugh she had decided she must forget in order to remember other things. Alondra stood at the back because she is a person who prefers to leave last, and because she had to text Reyes the words answer the reporter without giving him anything, and because she had to remind herself not to think of the hand with the comma as a hand. She looked at Eva when the hymn reached its chorus and Eva looked at her. The plank between them held.

After the burial, when everyone had eaten something they had not wanted to eat and left plates on flat surfaces as if plates could act as opinions, Eva returned to the church and found a girl in the third pew from the back, bent over like a pocket-knife and crying efficiently. This was not Mara. This was another one—Julia, from the break room roster and the back of one of the photographs discovered near the river. She started to apologize for being in the wrong room and then did the enormous work of stopping herself and held her apology down like a dog who will always want to jump on the furniture. She said “I thought I would see her,” and Eva, who has long since learned the rudiments of ghosts, said, “You did,” and sat, not close, not far, until the crying did what crying does when it is allowed to look like work: it finished itself and stood up and walked away without pity.

In the jail’s common room, on a Wednesday when the television insisted that there were other things to be upset about, a woman asked Catherine if she would draw her hand. This could have been a prank, but it was not. The woman’s name was Ray, which had once been short for something softer, and she had the precise tattoo of a pair of scissors on the inside of her wrist that men had admired until they stopped reading the words connected to it. Catherine said yes because she was not a monster in this particular way. She took the stub of golf pencil that the institution permitted and the tiny sheaf of paper that had been bought by a person who had thought about both cost and hope, and she made a drawing. Pencils have a kind of mercy that paint refuses; the medium of error is also the medium of shade. The hand came up on the page with more grace than the room offered. Ray cried because what else can a body do when it sees itself made worthy by a woman who has done terrible things for the pleasure of making. Catherine gave her the paper quickly, like a bad hostess cleaning up a glass after a spill. That night, with her forearm across her eyes, she murmured to the quiet that she did not miss the cold, and found that, for the first time since they had opened the square inside her wall, she had told a truth.

Late in the week, clouds came in from the ocean and pretended to be rain. The palm trees believed it and then forgot they had. The chaplain sat with Eva in the little office with its books that had been read and read again and asked her if she wanted to teach a class on the ethics of looking to teenagers, and she said no because teenagers already have eyes and what they need is permission not to use them sometimes. He said the bishop was learning to apologize like a person who has discovered a muscle and thinks everyone will want to see it flex, and she, because she was tired, did not rise to the bait of talking about bishops when what she wanted was to talk about God and soup and evidence. He asked if her daughter had forgiven her for whatever needed forgiving this week. She said there was nothing to forgive, which was, in their language, yes.

Reyes found in the hinge of a frame a hair that was not Catherine’s—a hair of a color that had once been called dirty and was now called ash by women who paid to achieve it. The lab made of it a story that pointed not at Jackie but at someone in the gallery who had been more intimate with the work than the woman at the desk had confessed. They went to the white room with warrants and mouths that had done this many times and left with a registrar who had thought the title meant documents and not responsibility for holding the line between a canvas and a body. She had adjusted tags and tape and thought she was behaving like a person with taste. She had never touched a parcel. She had told herself this enough times to blur the edges between categories. When Alondra asked her what she had believed she was doing, she said, with the absolute conviction of an innocent, “I was making sure the labels were straight,” and you could forgive her if you had ever stood in a room and needed something to be straight to believe you could go home.

When the paper came, the one that had to do with the language of charges and the crimes a person can commit with a chest freezer and quiet hands, it was official and inelegant. It would change as people learned more and strangers learned to say Lydia’s name without saying it like they had a right. Catherine read it inside a room painted the color of function and wrote in the margin the words she preferred: arrangement, proof, absence. She added another, just to make herself laugh: friend. Tanya, who had learned not to read over shoulders because every shoulder holds a story that will come for you if you let it, failed in her discipline this once and saw the word friend and closed her eyes and remembered a grandmother who had used the word dear on a girl who had not asked for it. She went to get coffee with too much powdered cream in it and thought about quitting for the sixteenth time, then returned and did nothing of the kind.

On a night when the transformers on the block decided to warm themselves noisily, Eva wrote on a single card a single sentence for Sunday, not because she would forget to say it but because writing makes a line in the body the way a scar anchors skin. She wrote: we are responsible not only for what we hold but for how we hold it. She put the card in her pocket and remembered it in her fingers until it was true. Outside, a train announced itself as if anyone with ears had not heard a train announce itself before. The gulls argued the old argument. The city adjusted again to its new room temperature. In the basement that had lost its hum, dust settled like a dignity the house had not managed to give itself before. And at the river’s edge, where water pretends to be able to keep secrets and fails, someone set down a bouquet without a note, and a woman walking a dog read the flowers like a paragraph and then kept walking, because that is what you do when the world hands you a sentence you are not ready to be responsible for: you carry it, and then you put it down.
