Blue eyebrows flickered under the street lamps like minnows kissed by an oil slick. In the alley behind the multiplex on Prospect, a clutch of teenagers—backpacks, skateboards, one with a mouthful of braces—were laughing too loudly at something private, something they’d forget by morning and pretend not to care about forgetting. The air carried the damp aftertaste of warm rain and popcorn salt. On the theater’s walls, posters for movies where the worlds end had already begun to peel.

It began like this: a breeze, a hush, a ripple in the dark like a giant someone walking soft. The kids looked up, not in unison, but nearly, because the human body is a tuning fork and something in them vibrated. A shadow muddled the star-bleared sky. And then a sound like a soda bottle being opened, a cork of carbonated night—pop—and then a long, keen hiss.

The youngest one, a boy with a hoodie tied around his waist, thought: comet. The tallest girl thought: crane. The one who would later become famous for a joke she regretted thought: it’s just wind. And then blue spattered the concrete like laughter.

The foam came first, then the dye. It arrived in an arc, a bright, ridiculous curve like a rainbow not quite finished, and it burst over their heads. It didn’t sting. It didn’t hurt. It smelled, insanely, like lilacs; like the kind of grocery store candle called Mist of Spring. They screamed anyway, because the night had already asked for a scream. It wove through their hair, stippled their foreheads, found their eyebrows like a musical note finding its key.

“It’s cold!” someone shouted. “It’s cold—it’s cold.” Someone else cursed. A boy tried to wipe it off and managed to smear it into something truer and more permanent, as if he had been waiting his whole life to inherit his face from a joke. One of the girls laughed too hard and then choked on nothing. For all of them, even before the light returned, the blue was already drying.

Down the length of the alley, a corrugated dumpster bore a single handprint twenty feet off the ground. It was not blue. It was pressure, a compressed palm in steel and dust. The imprint would be found the next morning by a sanitation worker named Albert M. who had not looked up at the sky in twenty-two years and, on seeing it, would become very quiet.

People began to talk about the eyebrows. People did not stop, not that week. Parents blinked at their children across breakfast tables, and the children stared back, as if the face they had worn overnight were a magic trick, as if their eyebrows had defected to some other civilization of the skin and all the houses on that border had been painted the wrong color. The dye wouldn’t wash out. It would lighten some, then darken again in the kind of humidity Champaign grew like tomatoes. Blue that wasn’t quite indigo, wasn’t quite cobalt. A blue like the idea of blue.

What the kids who were caught first had in common, you could list in a way that made sense, until it didn’t: teenagers. Out too late. Missing at least one next-day responsibility. Elevated BP compared to control group. A fondness for sauces. A tendency to kiss in empty parking lots and stop right before it mattered. Someone’s mother, across town, working the night shift at Carle and humming because she always humming. Everyone had a story. Everyone has a story; sometimes the story has you.

Above all of this, higher than the movie posters, higher than the highest letter on the multiplex marquee (two bulbs burned out at the top), something enormous moved with a carefulness that broke the hearts of a certain kind of person when they saw it, the kind who cry at statues because they seem to be trying too hard. She ducked, always, around the telephone wires. She moved quietly between silos and the tall eucalyptus imported by individuals with too much belief in growth. A giant, they called her later, because what else do you call a woman who can reach over a gas station canopy and catch a sparrow tumbling out of the world? It’s a poor word, giant, but we use it. Lynette, said a sign under a highway overpass, in aerosol script, not quite graffiti, more like an announcement whispered to a wall. Lynette. Love is fuel.

Doctor Mariani didn’t see the first eyebrows. She saw the other thing. She saw the handprint on the dumpster and folded her arms over her belly as if to keep her insides from sliding to the floor. She went out there because a former student texted her at 2:07 a.m. The text had a photo of the kids, faces blurred by motion, the blue not yet dry, and in the corner of that photo was sky, a sliver, a corner where you could see it was not nothing. She kept zooming in until pixels gave way. The shape was nearly shoulder. The shape was more like a hill. It was ridiculous to zoom like that, but she did, her breath a little too loud in the library still of her apartment. Her apartment smelled like old dry books no one had ever loved (though she loved them), and the radiator had its own weak opinions and said them at all hours.

Her students called her Doctor M most of the time, to her face, but sometimes, when they were unkind or too kind, her full surname arrived with a point. Mariani. As if she were an airport one could circle without ever landing. It took three drinks in a noisy bar for her to tell strangers, if they ever got that far, that she’d never slept with anyone. She said it like the color of her hair, factual, a piece of trivia that lived in the same drawer as knowing the state bird. Sometimes the men across from her were decent and the stalest thing they said was: your choice. Sometimes they were not. It did not matter, not now. She had a text on her phone and old tears on her face because the radiator had thunked and made her jump and she was tired. Morning was the study. Night had been trying for years to convince her.

She taught rhetoric at the university, but what she studied, between syllabi, in padded silence, was how a story becomes an organism. Urban legends made her, if we are admitting things. The way an untrue thing grows a skeleton, stands up, and begins to walk around. All the little lies get together, shoulder-to-shoulder, and become a body trustworthy enough to break your heart. She had a shelf of photocopied clippings: the phantom hitchhiker in Paxton, the haunted harmonium in Urbana, the cow that sat down during tornado warnings. In her notes the font was always too small because there were too many connections to waste space on letters. On her windowsill a plant reached for a light the window refused to admit.

You have to understand Champaign at night. You have to see the empty lanes like veins, the MTD buses sleeping cleanly in rows, their engines clicking as they cooled. The water towers like shoulders in the distance. The far hum of the interstate, and how it’s not a hum at all but a chorus learning to pronounce the word go. That first week, the days were gold and powdery and the nights stung with a sweetness that made people kind and reckless.

Her student’s name was Farouq and he was the one who brought it to her because he had read her paper about monsters with the wrong name. He worked nights at the multiplex tear-down crew and one of the kids who got splurged came back with his face blazing and said, “I didn’t do anything wrong. Why blue? Why me?” They weren’t asking for absolution. He was twenty, Farouq, and used to people’s grief falling apart in his hands. He sent the photo and then two words: it’s her.

“What are you doing up?” she asked when she called.

“What are you doing up?” he said, and somewhere behind him a machine rolled and rolled and tried to swallow cardboard.

They met in the alley. She wore her one pair of sneakers like a disguise. The dumpster’s handprint caught the light from above. She had to reach up with her fingertips to just trace the bottom of it, and the steel was cool and a little oily and there was dirt packed into the grooves where the world had been pushed. “Not a crane,” she said aloud without meaning to, because one is often alone at night even when someone else breathes nearby.

“Did you see her?” she asked, but she did not specify who, as if there were only one possible answer now in the whole lexicon of answers.

“I didn’t see anything. The kids were screaming. It was... There was this hiss. Like this,” and he tried to make the sound but it came out as an impression of a dying balloon.

A splurge-gun, said the rumor later, a gigantic ridiculous thing like something out of a musical where kids shoot custard at each other for the final number and no one dies. The splurge looked comical until your face was blue and your friends were blinking at you in that new way that stings more than any acid. The papers—yes, there are papers, old ones that say things you don’t expect—had used the word in 1979. A “splurge device,” teens marked with dye on a dare, in Kankakee. It had been reported as prank, no giant involved, no decent photographs, but the word burrowed in like an egg. Dr. Mariani has a gift for seeing words tunnel things.

She spent three days with her eyes too wide open. Sleep stayed out of reach, polite and cruel, like a party happening two doors over. She read every post tagged with bluebrow in the first hour, then stopped, because the point at which a joke turns into a weapon is quiet, and she didn’t want to watch that part in real time. She walked to the corner store on Third at 4 a.m. and the woman behind the counter looked at her face as if the blue might be there already. She bought a notebook and a pen that promised it would not skip. She wrote: she will be strong. She wrote: love is fuel. She wrote something else and then scratched it out so messily that now, decades later, that page looks like it was used to clean a wound.

Everyone had a theory about Lynette. In the coffee shop on Wright that summer, the baristas wrote Lynette on cappuccinos with cinnamon. Someone in a bunny mask recited a free-verse series on the quad about giants and guilt. A boy whose eyebrows had been spared wrote a song and got in trouble for the chorus. People saw her in dreams. People saw her on the weather radar. There were grainy videos of a silhouette folding itself behind a water tower. There were blurry images of a hand tipping a water bottle to a parched dog. In so many versions, she was not villain at all, but a saint with no cathedral tall enough to hold her. In so many versions, she was exactly what you fear when you are very small and your parent says: I can’t help you right now.

What was not disputed, except by people who prefer not to see the world: the eyebrows were blue, and the blue stayed.

Dr. Mariani thought at first that her job would be identification. This is what scholars do, we tell ourselves, we say: this folktale rhymes with that one. This data set calls to this other. But she watched the ten-second clips and the fifteen-minute conspiracies and realized identification would be cowardice here. That she had loved monsters too much to see this one. That she had loved the idea of loving too much, too, and had smothered it to keep it from hurting her. In her apartment a spider spun a web between two bookends and the fly never came. She shook the web down in guilt the next day.

“I know where she’ll go next,” said Farouq three days into it, eating a sandwich he’d made from white bread, cheese, something that might have been an onion, above the city map in the student center. They leaned over the glass together, their reflections cut up by the intersecting streets, two faces grafted onto the shape of a place that pretended it had one.

“Tell me,” said Dr. M. It was easier to let him be sure. It was easier to be enlisted.

“Prom,” he said, and then he had to laugh at himself, a breath through the nose that sounded like betrayal. “Okay, not prom. But the thing at Hessel. The under-fifteen soccer thing. Or Homecoming. She’s marking kids. She’s going to be where kids are. She loves us.”

“She loves you,” Dr. M repeated, as if to hold the sentence until it stopped wobbling, and she saw him lift his chin, because who doesn’t want to be loved by a god.

You have noticed, by now, that the rumor of Lynette always held that she was fueled by love. This was not a metaphor at the beginning. It was literal, or as literal as rumor knows how to be. The fuel was not chemical, not diesel. People swore they had seen it, the way a glow comes up through the skin, the way a face brightens when the person you have been waiting for walks into a room and it turns out to be you. They said that when Lynette took a step, it was because she thought of someone else. That when her hands opened it was because she had forgiven someone. A radio man on 92.7 The Drive, who had once been fired for laughing when a caller cried about the drought, said into his microphone, “She’s a giant fuelled by love,” and then the phone lines lit up.

It’s obscene, said a woman who sold bread at the farmers’ market, to mix love and weapons. She didn’t mean weapons. She meant what it feels like to be marked. To walk into a room and have everyone know you have been chosen by something that doesn’t explain itself.

At Hessel Park, on the Saturday after the first eyebrows, the air was crooked with kites. A clown inflated animals while a man with a clipboard asked people to sign up for campaign volunteer hours. Kids tugged their parents toward the shaved ice truck and someone under a tree tuned an instrument that would never play. Dr. M stood by the fountain and tried to look like a person. She carried herself like a quiet thing that had learned to put on a suit of noise when necessary.

“Doctor?” someone said, and she turned and then had to look down because the voice was short. A girl, twelve maybe, with the blue not on her brows but in a stripe under her eye like a streak of royal war. The child smiled with the intense politeness of children who have been taught to present the world with their best manners because the world can be cruel. “Are you the one who writes about ghosts?”

“Sometimes,” said Dr. M. “Usually I write about people being afraid of things they shouldn’t be afraid of.”

“Like love,” said the girl, very decisively, and then she handed Dr. M a folded piece of paper. “She says hi.”

Dr. M did not laugh in the child’s face, which is a triumph. She unfolded the paper. It was from the stationary set with the cartoon cats that sold at the bookstore on campus. The paper had been folded twice and then again, turning circles are circles because they don’t stop. The handwriting was large, the way some people write when they want the pen to be as big as the feeling they carry.

It said: STOP IF YOU MUST BUT DO NOT CALL ME BAD. I AM MAKING THEM VISIBLE. IT IS EASIER TO LOVE WHAT YOU CAN SEE.

She put the paper into her left pocket and felt suddenly like her body had tilted very slightly toward the ground. “Did she give you this?” she asked the girl.

The girl shook her head. “She gave it to Mr. Rossi and then he gave it to my mom and then my mom said this looks like something the lady who writes about ghosts should see and then she said don’t go over there, and I said why not, and she said because that lady probably wants some peace.”

“Your mom is probably right,” said Dr. M. “What’s your name?”

“Pilar.”

“Pilar, you did me a favor today.” She meant it like a blessing. She meant it like a sea that knows the names of the fish who swim in it.

Pilar shrugged, as if favors were free, and then pointed behind Dr. M’s shoulder, where a boy with sky for eyebrows was climbing up onto the edge of the fountain and holding a speaker over his head in a reference he probably had not earned. The speaker slipped; he caught it. Someone else laughed. The sky went thin, the way it does before wind. You could have said the mood changed. You could have said a giant had ducked beneath the canopy of leaves and was waiting for something like permission.

The splurge this time came from the north. Dr. M knew north not because she’d been a Girl Scout but because she’d walked these streets too long to pretend she didn’t know where home was. It came as a cough, a burst, a comic timing that belonged to a world where edges are softer. It slashed across the heads of a little wave of kids running toward the soccer field. The arc caught four, missed one, painted two in a flourish that was almost calligraphy. They had time to scream and then to laugh and then to stop laughing. The dye dripped an instant and then held fast. A woman yelled, “Hey!” into the sky a second before a toddler, amused by her own voice, copied her exactly. Dr. M was already moving.

She didn’t know what she’d thought she would do. Tackle. Leap. Throw her arms out wide and say what needs to be said when someone won’t stop doing the thing they say they have to do, which is: please don’t.

But the shape that moved between the oaks was not a thing you tackle. It was a gentleness with weight. The giant—Lynette, she must be Lynette—paused, there, half her body hidden by the thick leafy fuss of a willow, one hand open as if waiting to catch rain. Dr. M stopped, because there are moments when you don’t get to be a hero, unless you define hero as being properly humble.

In the hush there, Dr. M could hear something like two things pressed together: the steady drum of a big heart and the other thing, tinny, like a radio down a hall. She didn’t know what the other thing was and later, when she did, she wished she had known then because she might have said a kinder sentence. The other thing was voices. The other thing was other people’s names.

“You will say I am cruel,” said the giant, and her voice came like the last breath of air in a swimming pool. Not as words; as understanding.

“I will say you’re choosing,” Dr. M replied, forgetting she might be speaking to something that didn’t speak her language the way she spoke it. “I will say you are choosing a kind of pain and calling it love.”

Lynette tilted her head, the motion so slow you could have set your watch by it if your watch were willing to tell you the truth. The sun slid off the top of her hair like water off an oiled duck. She was not beautiful the way a fashion magazine is beautiful. She was beautiful the way a wooden spoon is beautiful, worn down by stirring.

“You named me in your mouth before anyone else did,” said Lynette. “You reached for me with your words. Sometimes words are ladders.”

“I didn’t name you,” said Dr. M. “The city did. I’m only a person.”

“You’re a person who knows what stories eat,” said Lynette, softly. She extended one hand, palm upward, and the air at the center of her palm was warm and brightening, and Dr. M had a fine, fine fear prick every pore and then settle as if at parade rest. Love, then. Fine. Love like steam. Love like something you could burn your tongue on.

“Why their eyebrows?” Dr. M asked, because academic is as academic does, which is: ask a small question that carries inside it a bigger question you don’t want to admit out loud for fear of being sentimental. Eyebrows are ridiculous. Eyebrows are banners no one signed up to carry. Eyebrows are almost trivial.

“So they can see themselves being seen,” said Lynette. “So when they look mirrorward, they can’t pretend. It is not punishment. You punish yourselves. It is an outline. The world has a terrible memory. I am reminding it.”

“Of what?” Dr. M said. “Of who? You.”

Lynette made the smallest sound. In a small mouth, it would have been a sigh. On her it was a wind on dry grass. “I don’t know how to say this without breaking something,” she said. “If you want me to stop, you will have to tell everyone to stop believing in the blue. Teach them that it means nothing.”

“I can’t tell a town what to think,” Dr. M said. “That never works.”

“Then we will be here a while,” said Lynette, and then she turned her face and for the first time in a hundred small ways, someone saw her eyes. They were not the color of any dye.

Dr. M took a step because not to step is something only statues can afford. “If love is your fuel,” she said, “you can choose a different road.”

“Can I,” said Lynette, and there was no question in it. She bent slightly at the waist, so that her breath moved through the leaves and made the leaves speak in their own idiom. “Doctor from Champaign. Virgin. Collector of ghosts. You carry so much not-doing like a trophy. You think if you do not, nothing will be done to you.”

It would be possible here to write about the way the heart buckles like a folding chair. It would be possible to drag her history out into the open like a throw rug. We won’t. She stood there, nonexistent height, looking up, and all the heaviness of never and maybe sat in her throat. “It worked, until it didn’t,” she said, not sure if she had meant to say it out loud, and a child behind her laughed at the way an ice cream slipped queerly off a cone. The world, persistent in its comedy.

Lynette opened her other hand. The splurge gun, if that was what it should be called, lay easy in her palm. It was a thing like a trumpet, like a toy. It was addled with stickers: a cat, a heart, a wistful face that might have been a cloud. It was absurd. It was so lightly made a child could have lifted it, if the child had also possessed hands the size of pie pans. The nozzle was caked blue as if it were a cake froster in the hands of a devout. She could have used it on anyone. She did not point it at Dr. M.

“Would you like to hold it?” asked Lynette, like a tender aunt offers a baby to a cousin at a picnic. “I can set it down. It will not spill. It only spills when I think of a face. I am disciplined. It isn’t much. It is what I have.”

“I don’t hold weapons,” said Dr. M automatically, foolishly, and then heard herself and wanted very much to laugh because how was this a weapon? How was it anything but?

Lynette laughed once, in surprise, right down in her belly, and for a second a flock of birds rose from the trees as if a storm had grumbled. “You hold a pen,” she said. “You press it down. Same posture.”

Something like falling began in Mariani’s knees and she put her hand against the tree without permission. “You can stop,” she said, and the edges of the words were blunt, because she didn’t sand them down first. “Whatever you think you’re doing, you can stop doing it and not stop being who you are.”

Lynette cocked her head again and her eyes moved to the fountain, as if the small rectangular clutch of water mattered to her in some old way. She made a small noise; maybe the noise only existed inside the bones of people who noticed. “If I stop,” she said, “they go back to disappearing. If I stop, the world says: who? and it means it. I am not painting guilt on them. I am painting proof. When they are older they will say: that was me, and someone will believe them.”

“You’re collecting them,” said Dr. M, and she was still thinking as she spoke, always three seconds behind herself. “You’re—archiving. You think archived love can last longer than now.”

“They archive wars,” said Lynette. She held the splurge gun like a brown bag someone else had packed for her. “They archive sorrow. I am trying balance. It is not fair. I am trying anyway.”

They looked at each other for another moment. It was not the kind of looking where a solutions pops up like a prairie dog and waves. It was the kind where you accept the terrible possibility that you cannot convince someone out of their self.

A siren began and then thought better of it. The park breathed out. At the edge of the field, a coach cupped his hands around his mouth and called a name that might have been Marco, might have been Martha. It doesn’t matter. It never matters which name, as long as someone says it.

“Will you stop?” said Dr. M again. “Even for a week.”

“For a week,” said Lynette, as if trying it on. “I will stop when I run out of you.”

“Me?”

“You. All of you,” Lynette said, and her eyes flicked over the park with its kites and a dog cropped too close, with its teenagers who had learned how to be looked at and then learned how to be looked away from. “You.” She adjusted the splurge gun and for a second you could have believed she might hand it over. Instead she lifted it the smallest fraction of an inch, pointed it at the air above them, and squeezed. The nozzle spit a thin rope of blue that landed on nothing, made a brief, absurd ribbon hanging there, and then the ribbon fell into the fountain and became water again.

A woman clapped, thinking it was a trick. A child clapped because clapping is how you tell your hands you are alive. Someone took three pictures and no matter how hard they tried later, none of those pictures would show anything more than a streak of sky and the corner of a hem. People want evidence and the world keeps a very tight budget.

“Don’t make me a curse,” said Lynette to Dr. M, and for an instant resentment climbed up and then obediently sat. “Don’t write me like that.”

“I won’t,” said Dr. M, and believed herself. “I will write you like a question.”

“Good,” said Lynette, and then her outline became a little less outline. The edges of her did that thing edges do when the air is the wrong kind of hot, when everything seems to be wavering, when nothing will hold still long enough to examine. “Tell them,” she said, “tell them to find me in their faces. If they can bear it.”

“What if they can’t?” Dr. M asked.

“They will anyway,” said Lynette, and then she was moving away, not like a retreat, not like a charge, but like someone who knows it is time to go because the light has changed color. She placed her palm on the water tower beyond the park just for a second as she passed it, the way people touch a doorway for luck. The water tower shivered as if it had been a long time since anyone famous had come by.

Dr. M stood there until a policeman who was too new at his job to be wary of quiet women approached her and said, “Ma’am?” She blinked her face back into the face she used for students who turned papers in late and said, “I’m fine, thank you,” and he nodded in relief because his training had not covered what she was.

In the days that followed, the attempts to make it stop proliferated. There were banners hung from overpasses reading: YOU ARE SEEN. There were moms with their own eyebrow pencils trying to get ahead of it, blueing their faces first and walking into high school gymnasiums with the righteousness of saints. There were sermons. There were laughs. A boy turned seventeen with the blue still luminous over his eyes and he said, into a camera in his bedroom, “Thanks for noticing I exist,” and then he threw the camera onto his bed like a grenade and the internet applauded. A girl shaved her eyebrows off entirely and got in trouble for not following cheer team code. The dye didn’t care. The dye is indifferent to hair. It clung to skin. It stayed when you tried to outrun it. It faded and then there it was again. People began to confess things to strangers on buses. People began to not meet each other’s eyes. The blue became a way to talk. The blue became a way not to.

Dr. M made a map on her wall with yarn that didn’t quite match. She pushed pins into Champaign, Urbana, and then farther out, Savoy, Rantoul, Mahomet. The footprints were never footprints. The photographs people took of Lynette’s passing were always of what she did not leave: the air folded where she had been, a branch with a new arc to it, a stoplight that would not stop blinking. She wanted what the giant had left out. We all want the negative space, from time to time. That was Dr. M’s vice and virtue both.

At night she sat at her kitchen table and wrote sentences down that did not yet know they were a book. She wrote, she is not a warning. She wrote, she is not a promise. She wrote, the teenagers are more resilient than we are, and then scratched that out and wrote, the teenagers are carrying something we left on the side of the road because we were tired.

She dreamed that Lynette stood outside her window at three floors high and tapped gently on the glass. She dreamed that the splurge gun made a noise like a mother making a silly noise at a baby. She dreamed that she was thirteen and that her eyebrows were so vivid they could not be borne. She woke with a taste like coin in her mouth and the radiator putting on airs. She wanted to call someone and say: I am afraid of a good thing. Instead she went to her desk and made a list of all the places a giant might hide between Urbana and here. The list included quad. The list included the big lot behind the Meijer. The list included church steeples, not because they are tall but because they are always telling you where to look.

A letter arrived in her campus mailbox. It had no stamp. Someone had slid it into the slot as if the man at the counter were a confession and this was absolution. The paper was the same. The handwriting larger. It said: YOU WILL THINK I AM PICKING ON THEM. I AM NOT. THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY. Then a long line of blue. As if the sentence ran out of itself.

She took the letter home and stared at the repeating words until they stopped being words and started being a remembering of a time when you said a thing out loud to make it real. They already what? They already are vanishing. They already are brave. They already are marked in other colors you cannot see. There are so many ways to fill in any blank; the danger is you pick the one you are hungriest to believe.

A week in, there was a late-night show segment where a comedy writer in a suit papered over his nerves with a monologue about the Big Blue Brow Bandit and her youthful victims, and Dr. M turned the television off because the laughter wasn’t going to help. The world can joke itself into any position it likes. The world can laugh all the sharp edges off a thing and then claim it was safe all along.

“Are you going to stop her?” Farouq asked, the next time he saw her, on the steps of the English building where the brick fights quietly with its own age. He was holding two coffees that he thrust at her like they were answers. He looked older suddenly, the way people look older when they finally decide to say everything they’ve been thinking.

“She doesn’t want me to make her a villain,” Dr. M said, as if this were the same as saying yes.

“What does she want?”

“She wants help being right without having to be wrong first.”

“She sounds like a professor,” he said, and she barked laughter up into the bright September, and students with eyelashes like tactical gear looked over, then looked back down at their phones.

“I don’t know how to stop her,” she admitted. “I’m beginning to think stopping is not an option. Redirecting, maybe.”

“Redirect her where?” he said, and stepped aside for a skateboard that came humming.

“To the parts of town where no one watches,” Dr. M said quietly. “Ask her to mark adults. Ask her to mark the sheriff. Ask her to mark me.”

“Do it,” he said, and got a look on his face like after you dare someone and they say fine, and you realize you were never brave enough for the dare.

Dr. M tried, that night, in her apartment, with the window open and the night like velvet borrowed from a theater. She spoke to the air as if it were an answering machine and she had only a minute to say everything. “Mark me, then,” she said, voice steady in the grossly ordinary room. “Mark me for all the men I didn’t love back because it was easier. Mark me for the kids I played fair with and the ones I gave up on because it was easier. Mark me for the glass I didn’t break to get to the other side. Do your blue if you must. And then let them go.”

She slept, finally, and woke with her face tingling and thought for a foolish three seconds: yes. She ran to the bathroom mirror and saw only her own eyebrows there: human, unremarkable, busily not blue. She laughed and cried at once for a minute, an ugly sound. On her way to the stove for coffee, she saw the note on the table, and picked it up as if it might be hot.

In the margin of her own letter, in her own room, between a paragraph and the word however, a smear of blue had dried in a small, tidy slash, like a punctuation mark from a foreign grammar. Not on her body. In her book. A mercy or a teasing. She touched it. The dye did not come off on her finger. It had a smell like a candy she had loved and then grown out of. She smiled in spite of herself and because of herself both.

The next morning the town woke to find the grain silo on the south edge of town had a new sign, a stripe of blue that ran from its lip down to the ground, dazzling, impossible. Someone with drone skills filmed it with swooping anger. It was a ridiculous sacrament. The silo wore it well.

This is not a story with a man in a uniform nailing a giant’s ankle to the ground. This is not a story with a tranquilizer dart. That first month, the city council held a meeting that lasted four hours longer than it needed to because a woman named Judith refused to stop telling the room about the night in 1988 when she had shaved her head and no one asked her why and how that had saved her life. In a town where nothing is ever much of an emergency until the sky changes colors, people learned to say: we don’t know. It was a kind of holiness.

Dr. M went to sleep every night with the sound of someone else’s heartbeat in her ear, a borrowed noise the city had learned to make. In the thin hour between three and four, she heard footsteps sometimes. Not outside; in her head; in the map room. She moved pins around and stood on a chair to reach the top of her own wall and wrote: stop me if I say villain. She wrote: be fair to the kids. She wrote: be fair to Lynette. Be fair to the city that loves a good story because it is bored and also because it is aching.

On a Sunday evening, when the orange had a pink tucked into its hem and the air above the corn belonged to some other era, she parked her car at the edge of a field, turned off the engine, and sat in the silence that snaps everything back into itself. She got out and walked. There was a path beaten into the verge by no one in particular. A hawk hung in the acrylic sky. Five miles that way, people were watching something funny that would be unfunny in three months. Two miles that way, someone was being born. The ordinary world ripped and mended itself, as always. Then a shadow moved. Then a long arm reached out and pressed gently against a barn, as if the barn had said, my back hurts, and the hand had said, let me.

“You keep expecting me to come to you,” said Lynette, and Dr. M did not jump. “You keep expecting me to be where you think love will make sense.”

“I expect to have to drive,” said Dr. M, and her own voice felt like a jacket on a warm day. “You tell me where to go.”

“Here,” said Lynette, and when she stepped close enough that the wind off her body made the trees nod, the love-intake sound in her chest was louder than it had been. So were the other sounds. The tinny radio down the hall had doubled. Names. Names, names, names, stitched inside the bigger drum. Daniel. Tai. May. Idris. Zoë. In the future there will be arguments about whether Dr. M heard those names. There will be people who insist she made them up because she was trying to give the giant a moral jawline. Believe what you can afford to.

“I can’t stop you,” said Dr. M, because the older you get, the easier it is to say this. “I can be with you while you do what you do.”

“That is a harder sentence than it looks,” said Lynette, and if you had been there you would have cried a little and not known why. “Come then,” she said, holding out her hand, not as a lover does, not as a mother, as something else, something stranger and older, and Dr. M did not take it because the distance between a human hand and a giant hand is partly distance and partly the part of us that is still afraid of falling.

“I’ll walk,” said Dr. M, and Lynette nodded like a friend and began to move, and together they traced the field’s edge, and behind them the corn whispered because it is a gossip, and ahead of them a town waited to see what it would believe.Dr. M learned the pace of her. The way a field length shrank under Lynette’s stride and stretched under the human one. The way the giant paused for fences like a person pausing for a memory, lifting a foot the size of a family reunion and setting it down with all the apologies an elephant eucalyptus branch has ever made. The faint metallic clink of telephone wires greeting her shoulders when she misjudged and then, immediately, did not misjudge again. When you walk beside something that cannot convincingly pretend not to be myth, you start noticing human-scale myth, too. The low drawl of insects arguing the old arguments. The slumped tractor like a man who forgot his line. The tinny radio down Lynette’s hall of a chest grew louder when they passed certain yards, as if certain houses knew their names better. In one yard a porch light burned and a woman sang badly to a baby who did not care about pitch. At that house, Lynette’s intake hum warmed enough to tint the air around them. It was indecent to witness and ordinary to the point of boredom, a combination that made Dr. M feel as if she had been trusted with a sandwich she could not quite eat.

“I don’t have an origin story,” said Lynette, not looking at her, the way polite people face the road when they talk because talking is vulnerable enough. “They will make one for me. There will be a boy and a lake. There will be a lab. There will be a prayer that got big by accident. The truth is thin. I have always been here, in the sense that I am made of all your hurrying. If you want something you can pick up, pick up that.”

Dr. M said, “If I write down no origin, they will say I omitted. If I write down five, they will say I am indecisive.”

“They will say you are a woman,” said the giant, and the soft cruelty of it made both of them wince.

In class, the following week, she brought a passage from a nineteenth-century farmer who had written about a storm as if it had asked him for a dance, and the students groaned in unison at the adjective “maidenly” because some things are easy to groan at. She wrote the word witness on the board and underlined it. She wrote the word archive and drew an unsteady box around it. The kid with the guitar calluses and the eyebrows so blue they might have been stamped onto his face by an impatient god squinted at the words like they were chess pieces he wasn’t ready to move. A girl with the prettiest notebooks Dr. M had seen in a decade raised her hand and said, “Isn’t witness inherently violent? Because you are looking at something and you can’t unlook.”

“Sometimes,” Dr. M said, and her white chalk hand was dusted to the wrist like she had been digging in flour. “Sometimes it can also be the gentlest thing we do for each other. I see you is dangerous because it opens a door. It is also delicious. Who is allowed to say I see you in this town?”

“Her,” said someone from the back, lazy with the certainty that the only pronoun anyone needed now was the giant’s. “She’s doing it to kids who don’t have a language yet.”

“Kids always have a language,” said the bluebrowed boy, surprising himself. “Adults don’t like it.”

After class he hovered and didn’t, then hovered again. He told her his mother had wanted to paint over his eyebrows with foundation and he had said, “Let it be, Ma,” and now he couldn’t tell if he had said that because he believed it or because he wanted to see his own face in the mirror and feel brave. He said the boys on his block had turned their own brows into flags with eyeliner and he had laughed and then hated himself for laughing. He did not cry. He was the kind of earnest that makes teachers remember why they took the job even when the building leaked. She said, “Will you talk to me on the record later?” and he said, “If you don’t make me a lesson,” and she said, “I can try.”

The city did a thing cities do when faced with a phenomenon that resists explanation: it made a committee. The committee met in the basement of the municipal building where the floor had been polished too often and still refused to shine. There was a long table with a jug of water that tasted like its own container. There was a man with shoulders like a backboard and a pin that read BUSINESS FORWARD. There was a woman who had done daycare for forty years and had opinions about everything except her own fatigue. There was a high school principal who introduced himself as Randy even though the placard said Randall T. Merson. There was a representative from Eppley Laboratories, which had flown a woman from St. Louis with a sleek ponytail and a voice that knew how to smile. She brought a prospectus and a promise of a solvent and a word the room wanted to be balm: reversal.

Dr. M sat near the end and took notes as if the words might run away if she didn’t nail them to the page. She wrote, in the fat space of her notebook margin, you cannot reverse a conversation by wiping your mouth. The Eppley woman said, “We are exploring a topical application that will safely deactivate the chromophores in the dye compound. We have a memorandum of understanding with the Attorney General about fast-tracking approval,” and the daycare woman said, “I don’t care about your chromophobes—” and the principal said, “Chromophores, Mags,” and she said, “I don’t care, either way,” and the Eppley woman nodded the way women nod when men in the room are watching to see if they can deal with a tone.

From the back came a cough like a dissent clearing its throat. Albert M., sanitation worker, hat in his hands the way a hat belongs in hands when a man comes underground, stood and did not fit into the expectation the room had laid out for how he would speak. He did not speak immediately. He looked at the jug, looked at the prospectus, looked at the sign above the door that said NO SMOKING as if it had nothing to do with him, and then said, “I saw the hand.” A pause. “On the dumpster.” He might have been saying I saw my own life today for the first time like a map. The room rotated his sentence from angle to angle as if trying to see if the light caught. “It’s not a joke,” he said. “Nothing this big is a joke.” He sat down and the Eppley woman smiled and said, “Exactly,” which was not what he meant.

Later, in the parking lot where the committee had to go back to being a parking lot, Albert held his hat low over his eyes and told Dr. M, “I didn’t look up for twenty-two years. I was proud of it. Felt like I was resisting a thing. I ain’t sure what. When I saw her print, I thought, oh, so that’s where the sky’s been. Up there. Forgot it was even up.” His fingers worried the brim of his hat as if it had disobeyed him and needed to be taught. “I ain’t got kids,” he said and then, as if hearing himself say it for the first time, “I ain’t got kids,” and looked across the lot at a girl with blue eyebrows laughing with her whole body. “It ain’t right for the lab to come in and scrub a town so it looks good on paper. Sometimes a mess is a record.”

The Eppley woman put a pop-up booth at the farmers’ market anyway. She had the sense to leave the corporate logo off the banner and hired a local kid with soft hands to hand out pamphlets that said CHOICE in font that tried too hard. On the second Saturday she set a sample on the table—a tiny jar with something so clear inside it looked like it had eaten transparency for breakfast—and asked passersby to dab a dot on the pamphlet to see how it interacted with the blue dot printed there. The dot lightened, obedient as a schoolchild. A woman whose child had a unibrow so enviable everyone in line flirted with it reached a finger toward the jar and then did not touch it. Her face did the math of all the ways her kids had been saved by things she had said no to. The jar caught the sunlight and made a clean, cheap halo that a photographer would have killed for. Lynette did not come to the market. You felt, anyway, the way some people feel when they decide, privately, not to go to a party because attending would make the party about them.

When the town hall came, it was not the one in the municipal basement; it was the kind where anyone with a grievance and a throat could be a bell. It was at the high school gym under that big mural nobody could agree about, a Native man painted so nobly you couldn’t decide if he was a person or a symbol. The bleachers gave and groaned under bodies. The sound system popped and then pretended to be adequate. In the bathroom a sign over the sink told cheerleaders the correct length of their nails. Stacked under the basketball hoop were the folded chairs from the last time the town had needed someplace to sit and have feelings. Dr. M sat three rows up with Farouq, the paper of his program crinkling as if he were trying to fold it into something else. The sheriff, who had the kind of forearms that make you want to confess that you had once pocketed a grape at the grocery store, stood with a microphone and said the kinds of sentences men like to say in rooms like this, sentences that contained assess and ongoing and partnership.

“We have contacted the Governor’s office,” said a council member with a face the exact color of fresh radishes. “We’re convening a working group.”

“We need action, not working groups,” yelled a voice and five voices murmured, yes, but no one leapt to their feet. A boy with blue eyebrows and a varsity jacket had scrawled over the Eppley pamphlet in his lap: do not fix me. A woman with her hair in a scarf stood up in the aisle and said, “Can you mark my husband? He doesn’t see nobody unless they yell, and I am tired of yelling.” Some people laughed and some people did not because they had been women with the exact same mouth.

The sheriff took it like a man takes a pie in a movie, which is to say he accepted it as part of the performance. “We will not allow vigilantism,” he said, which was, everyone felt, not quite the right word. A rumor had already begun before his sentence ended that someone had seen the giant near the water tower again. A rumor had taken its shoes off and was rubbing its feet and was in no hurry. Dr. M felt the pressure change. You know that pressure change. The way the day seems to pull its sleeves down. The way your lungs consult with one another about whether now is a good time to learn to be gills.

She did not appear in full. She slid into the space where the gym ends and the sky begins, like breath under a door. A child pointed. The sheriff dropped the microphone and it made a noise like a pet you have accidentally stepped on, brief and pitying. The slow blue of the sky was a conspiracy of noncommittal. The splurge gun lifted. It did not point at teenagers. It did not point at children. It did not, notably, point at the Eppley booth slinking in from the side like a shy idea. It pointed at the banner above the stage where five words had been printed so large your own retinas were forced to absorb them: UNITY IS OUR STRENGTH. The arc cut the U and the N in two and ran down the Y like a tear. The banner wore its mark like a sash at a pageant. The collective inhale was not belief; it was recognition. On the floor, the dye trickled in old lines, found the cracks in the gym varnish and settled like a lesson. The sheriff bent, and when he stood, there was a thin blue signature on his fingers that would not wash off no matter how many towels he mangled in the locker room later. He put his hand to his forehead without meaning to, a practice salute. It left a smudge right where a saint’s thumb would go.

After, the gym did the thing gyms do when they have been asked to hold something bigger than basketball. They hummed along pretending they had always known how. The janitor—a woman with keys that could open every sadness in that building and never did—mopped and mopped and could not lift the blue out of the wood. She looked at the new river in the court and said, “Okay,” to it. Dr. M went home with the tiredness that has nothing to do with muscles and everything to do with watching your town learn a new trick.

She dreamed a whole story for Lynette that she promised, upon waking, she would never write. In the story, the giant had been a teenager once after all, had been the kid who stayed late after school to staple flyers straight, had stood in the rain because someone else’s bus was late, had let a boy kiss her because he asked like a human. In the story the boy went away and the love did not, and it built a scaffolding so tall she had to climb it and when she got up there the air was thin and she saw the whole stupid beautiful town and wanted to sit in their hair like a flower no one could pull out. It was a junk story and she loved it fiercely the way you love a baby that hasn’t learned its own hands. She got up and made coffee with one hand and with the other wrote: do not save her with a boy. She underlined it so hard the page bruised.

Pilar showed up at her office with a pack of Gushers and a request. She stood in the doorway like a bookmark and said, “Can you teach me to collect?” She meant like Dr. M collected rumors and with the word collect made it sound like a tender theft. Dr. M handed her a legal pad and said, “Start by writing down what you think you know and put a box around what you actually saw,” and Pilar did, tongue out at the corner of her mouth, determining the width of her own certainty. She wrote: she said hi. She wrote: she smells like candy, which Dr. M corrected to: she smells like the idea of candy. Pilar rolled her eyes because kids have no patience for the adult impulse to italicize everything. “My eyebrows aren’t blue,” Pilar said, apropos, peeling a Gusher and splitting it neatly along its seam. “But sometimes when I look in the mirror my skin looks more like a map than a face. Do you think that’s what she wants?”

“I think she wants what we want,” said Dr. M. “To walk into a room and not think, what do I owe this space to be allowed in it. To walk in and think, the space owes me a chair.” Pilar looked at her like she had been handed a riddle in a language she almost spoke. She put the legal pad in her backpack like a fragile thing.

Farouq put together a show. He called it Browbeat because puns are a way to pretend a gun isn’t on the table. He rented the back room of a bar that had last hosted a jazz trio that had pretended to know one another. He invited three kids he knew and two he didn’t and a woman who had been marked at forty-nine—no one had seen her splurged, but her brows carried the blue like someone had painted a line on the street and then the town had had to follow it. He stood in the doorway and took five dollars and put them in a cigar box someone had once loved, and he told Dr. M, “It isn’t a fundraiser, but I don’t know how to do something completely for free yet.” The woman with the forty-nine-year-old eyebrows got up and said into the old microphone, “I am married to a dentist who eats frosting at night with a spoon, and he cried when he saw me blue, and I don’t know if he cried because he saw me or because he thought he had failed to keep everything neat.” The kids nodded as if she had been reading them bedtime. A boy with a shaved head and the most delicate eyelashes stood and said, “Everyone keeps saying it’s about being seen and, like, okay, but can I talk about how it also makes me feel like a stop sign? Like love is a car and sometimes it runs the sign and I die.” There was a silence afterward that was not awkward. It was weight-bearing. It could have been a floor.

The next morning a man in a bunny mask put a stamp on the water tower itself, a blue rabbit ear floating just below the crown. Nobody knows how he got up there. He might have flown. He might have dated a girl whose father owned a bucket truck. It was a year of hacks, of recycled courage, of knowing your way around a lock. The cops laughed and pretended they didn’t and said, “Vandalism,” and half the town thought, what isn’t.

A letter came in the same cartoon-cat stationary, the cats wearing sunglasses this time as if someone at the campus bookstore believed in novelty. It had been slipped again into her campus box, disrespecting the whole process of postage because what is postage but the trusting of your words to a system? She unfolded it on the bus and read it while a man across the aisle practiced his frown and a girl in a track jacket slept with her mouth open. YOU WILL CALL IT CONSENT, the letter said. YOU WILL ASK ME TO ASK. I AM ASKING ALREADY INSIDE THE AIR. IF YOU LISTEN YOU WILL HEAR THEM SAYING YES TO BEING ALIVE. The bus jolted and made a mistake at the light and the letter knocked against the window and the blue in one corner glinted the way oil does when it murders a puddle. She put it away. It itched in her pocket for a full block after she got off because the body knows when there is a heat-source near, even if the heat is stupid.

No one knew where Lynette slept. The rumor said corn. The rumor said the flat roof of the mall with its ancient JC Penney sign that refused to come down out of either faith or budget. The rumor said in the cooling towers of the power plant like a goddess inside a conch. The rumor said she did not sleep, which is the kind of cruelty we wish on saints. Dr. M began to notice the places where someone large might have leaned and those places were not always high. A ditch that had been compressed into a perfect curve. The crossbar of a swing set set ever so slightly out of true and kept that way, as if a hand had said: this is where it hangs now. Her map on the wall grew thread like a sweater at a party that has a dog.

“Let me mark you,” she said again one evening with her window open so wide the insects were voting on whether to be her roommates. “If it matters to you that I believe you are trying, then mark me.” She did not turn it into a dare. She tried to turn it into an offering. She woke to the feeling of weight near her head and did not scream because some things are the kinds of gifts you take in without frightening the giver. On the pillow beside her, pressed in the hollow where a head would be if myth slept like a person, a perfect blue handprint darkened the pillowcase. The hand was not grotesque. It was human-hand-sized. It was hers. She put her palm over it and matched. She changed the pillowcase and the print stayed on the fabric; it would not wash out. She changed the sheets entirely and when she took the pillow to the laundromat, the attendant who’d dyed her hair the color of a traffic cone admired it like a tie-dye that had finally got it right. She thought of sleeping on her own hand, of suffocating on the effort it takes to become. She slept without the pillow and woke with a sore neck. There are sacrifices and there are inconveniences and sometimes they are the same thing at different magnification.

The Eppley solvent made its way into two bathrooms. A boy with a mother who bought anything a woman in a lab coat told her to buy dabbed it on his left brow and not his right because he had carried fairness too far in every game he had ever played. The left paled, the right held. He went to school and someone said, “You look like a glitch,” and he wanted to go home and lie still until he could no longer be called by a name. He did not. He stayed. He watched the teachers not watch him. He went to the bathroom during fourth period and wrote the word stay on a paper towel and tucked it in his pocket. Later, when he kissed a boy under the bleachers, the boy touched the right brow and then the left and then said, “I like the one that stayed and the one that tried to go,” and it wasn’t poetry but it was worse; it was the truth, in teenage grammar, and that’s better.

A mother named Judith—yes, the same Judith who refuses to sit down as often as breath allows—started the stencil project. She cut out eyebrows from cardboard, big ones, too expressive by half, and spray-painted them blue on the sidewalks leading to the high school. Along one block the eyebrows looked curious. On the next block they were furious. On the last block they were so tired you wanted to scoop them up and carry them. A grumpy man with a leaf blower tried to harry the blue out of the concrete and the dye did its patient thing: it held. It held like a friend’s hand holds you when everyone else is pretending they don’t know your last name.

The letters stopped for a week and then returned on graph paper. The letters did not know what they wanted to be when they grew up. YOU WANT A PAST, this one said. I HAVE A HUNGER. IT IS NOT MY FAULT YOU CALL HUNGER A HISTORY WHEN IT STICKS AROUND THIS LONG. Dr. M laughed aloud at that and then put her hand over her mouth because she had read the sentence in the rare book room and the librarian, who wore her hair like an accusation, did not like laughter anywhere near vellum. She folded the letter up along graph’s implied lines and it folded so neatly it felt like magic, and then unfolded it and the creases had become part of what the letter meant. She wrote in her notebook: she did not ask to be your invention. She wrote: admit that love is not gentle. She wrote: stop apologizing for sentences that use the word love. She drew a tiny flag beside that and put a circle around the flag and wrote: incitement to tenderness.

It was Farouq who saw it first: adults. It started at a bank drive-through where a manager who had never once said, “I don’t know,” to a customer walked into work with a blue crown over his eyes that made his staff stare and then look away and then have to look back because you cannot not look at the proof that someone has been touched. Then a third-grade teacher whose students refused to make wish lists because they were superstitious about asking got marked on a day she had red lipstick on and she kept the lipstick on because sometimes doubling down is also grace. Then the host of the morning show who had used the word epidemic with a little thrill in her throat found her own eyebrows complimenting her brand-new blazer like a prank her mother would have laughed at. The teenagers stopped feeling like a target and started feeling like a contagion kids would gladly give to the adults if only it could pass by touch. Teachers told them not to rub their faces against their elders and the kids did not but they wanted to because giving adulthood something you have and they don’t is a pleasure as pure as rain after heat.

“Is this what you meant?” Dr. M asked Lynette in a field behind a self-storage facility where the rows of corrugated doors looked like a painting of itself. The giant had a dime on her palm. It was not a giant dime. It was a dime. She had found it in a parking lot and had not yet given it back to the world. “Sharing,” Dr. M said, and watched the intake hum swell when a couple in a Subaru in the lot over began to kiss as if they had not kissed in years, which perhaps they had not.

“It is what I am allowed,” said Lynette. “I would pluck out the need to be cruel in all your bosses if I could. I am, alas, not a surgeon.” She flicked the dime and it pinged a perfect note against the storage unit door and fell, and Dr. M had the childish urge to say, do it again, a greed she suppressed in favor of looking, again, at this nice woman who insists on being enormous.

“You changed your mind,” Dr. M said, because people like narratives that pivot, because it gives their own pivots permission.

“I did not,” said Lynette. “The town widened. I am not a pivot; I am a measure.” She looked at the self-storage units and her face did a thing like regret. “Look what you keep. Look what you are willing to pay to pretend you will need again.”

The county fair came as it always does, dragging with it the scent of fried participation. The ferris wheel went up and made its usual promises to couples who needed a height to make the dizziness feel chosen. The kids lined for the Gravitron and argued about who, among them, had the heart kind of strong that lets you taste metal without vomiting. The fair has always been a place where a town wears its poverty in sequins. It is honorable, this insistence on twinkle. Dr. M walked the midway with Farouq and let him talk about the girl who had laughed last week at something he had said and how he had laughed too and how he would rather be the kind of person who says, I like you, than the kind who plans thirty responses to a hypothetical text. She bought a funnel cake and let the sugar whitewash the part of her brain that kept records of everything that might go wrong. The 4-H kids showed pigs who had learned to be gods for two days and then, later, not; the kids loved them perfectly anyway. At the kissing booth, someone had hung a sign in careful cursive: NO EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Somebody had crossed it out and written: YES EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Under both, in an accel pen that bled through the paper: KISS EVERYBODY YOU CAN.

When the blue came that night at the fair, it arced over the ferris wheel and caught the top of a gondola where a woman about sixty sat with a boy too old to be hers. He put his hand on hers and pretended he was the one comforting. The blue caught the edge of the tilt-a-whirl operator’s forehead; he laughed and shook his head and did not pause the ride because some things cannot be paused once you’ve said yes to them. It slid down the silver side of the corn dog stand and made the metal look baptized. It dripped and did not drip. At the same instant the main stage lights snapped, as if obeying more interesting electricity, and the band—a good cover band, too earnest by half—fell quiet without rancor. The giant reached in and lifted a string of paper lanterns that had been strung low and would have caught on her wrist. She moved them up, gently, like adjusting a necklace on the throat of a friend. The murmurs in the crowd had the special sound of a whole town aligning their spines. Nobody ran. Running would have made it all smaller. The sheriff stood with his head bare and his fingers still faintly blue and gave back the hat he’d been handed because sometimes you do not deserve to cover yourself.

Later that night, in a motel near the interstate where the carpet was a geography no one wanted to plot, a man came to the desk and asked for blue-out in a tone that suggested he was doing the clerk a favor by including him in his problem. The clerk, who had a mother who would not forgive him until he forgave himself, said, “We don’t carry absolution,” and then, because he liked his job, said, “Try Eppley. They’re at the farmer’s market between the honey and the jars of second chances.” The man left, and the clerk made a small chalk line on the back of the desk and felt calmer. He pretended, briefly, to be keeping score and then put the chalk down and decided, bravely, not to.

Dr. M sat with her map and moved a pin from Savoy to a farm road whose name she’d driven a dozen times and never read. She wrote: the fair is a church where you can wear shorts. She wrote: she adjusted the string of lanterns. She wrote: she knows the height of us better than we do. She let herself put her head down on her desk, the way you are not supposed to because it will make you want to sleep and you have marked sleep for later. When she lifted her face, there was a faint blue half-moon on her cheek from where, somehow, somewhere, there had been a small, irresponsible smear of dye on her own notebook. She went to the bathroom and looked at her face and saw not punishment but punctuation. In the morning, it was gone. That did not mean it had not been there.

The Eppley woman left town and did not leave town. She left her jar and her pamphlets and her precise hair in the hands of a local pharmacist who had made her name giving people the wrong things for the right reasons. The jokes softened because they always do. The first boy to get married with blue eyebrows in the wedding photos cried when he saw himself in the proofs and said, to his husband and to the photographer and to the dumb white cake, “I am here, fuck,” and it was the most religious sentence spoken in his family in three generations. An old man with eyebrows like a mold breaking spoke to his church and said, “Y’all thought God was going to be loud. Maybe he is bright instead,” and half the church agreed and half muttered and all of them brought casseroles with noodles that took on holiness by association. A hair salon offered eyebrow styling for the unstyleable, and teenagers sat in chairs and watched the women make something ceremonial out of something imposed. No one had found a remover that did more than bruise.

From a hill no one else called a hill—because midwesterners are stingy with topography—Lynette watched a thunderhead become a city. Her head tilted the way her head tilted when she was listening to a voice that had not said its name out loud yet. She looked like what we make of angels when no one is watching us make them. Dr. M drove up and parked in the place her car had learned not to roll and did not honk or wave because you don’t call to the sky. She got out and stood beside the large ankle, which had a smudge of dust and one, green leaf stuck to it like a sticker put there by a child trying out an idea of ownership. She did not touch, not because she feared to, but because she is good at boundaries, sometimes to the attention-starved sadness of her own day. The air was heavy and felt like it had eaten something corrupting. The tinny radio in Lynette’s chest was loud and full of names that were also places; you, you, you, Urbana, you, Prospect, you, third-floor apartment with the crying radiator.

“Do you want me to stop?” Lynette asked, and this time it was a question that asked for an answer instead of a confession.

“I want you to do what you can bear living with later,” said Dr. M, which was the worst and best thing she could have said. “I want you to consider marking the places and not just the faces.” She surprised herself with the rhyme and tried not to show that surprise to the giant because it felt like a bird that would fly away if named.

“What place do you want me to mark so your city cannot say it did not happen?” asked the giant, her hands empty of instruments, which is when the worst and best things happen.

Dr. M thought of the courthouse steps. She thought of the mosque. She thought of the high school stage where they had performed A Midsummer Night’s Dream in jeans and a single evergreen tree borrowed from Christmas. She thought of her own apartment door. She said, “The jail.”

Lynette nodded like a person who had also thought of the jail. When she moved in that direction, you could feel the ground not shake but affirm. The thunderhead did a theatrical thing because sometimes it is a gift to the town when the weather cooperates. They walked as if they had a chaperone, as if the air were a parent who did not approve of this friendship and could be convinced. The jail was uglier up close. Buildings built to hold sorrow on purpose always are. The parking lot light flickered with the pathos of fluorescent. Inside, a woman whose job it was to catalog the human body into the system’s stomach paged through a book and underlined the part about “identifying marks” and thought about whether she had any at all. The sheriff’s blue-fingered hand reached for the switch he had meant to fix for months and then an inch of blue found the gray slab of the building and wrote, neatly, on the concrete near the door, not a symbol, not a name, but the word: HELD.

The paint did not bleed. It did not drip. It sat there like a thesis. Staff stood, later, and read it and pretended they hadn’t. Men inside felt something cold and then something warm and then nothing because many of them had learned not to feel until it would not embarrass them. The word did not absolve. It did not accuse. It said, you are, which is different from the weeping I love you that songs teach. It said, you are, and the city had to count that as data.

“Thank you,” said Dr. M, because sometimes gratitude is a leash and sometimes it is a ladder and she could not tell yet which this would be.

“Do not thank a storm for rain,” said Lynette, but her mouth had softened and the names in her chest were louder and somewhere someone decided not to die that night and someone else decided to fall in love with someone who would not hurt them and neither will become statistics. They will become the stories you tell on porches when you are feeling brave about how you have survived yourself.

It would have been narratively satisfying if, here, someone had decided to climb a water tower with a sniper rifle and end a metaphor. Nobody did. It would have been narratively satisfying for Eppley to release a solvent that stripped blue and a layer of skin with it, and for the town to have a lesson about what you are willing to take off to look like the picture in your head. The solvent made some teenagers itchy and one adult nauseous and then stopped being a trend. It would have been narratively satisfying for Dr. M to kiss someone in a parking lot and be marked mid-kiss and laugh and let the laugh live. She did not kiss anyone. She went home and cooked a pot of beans and read a novel about a woman who could hear the dead humming in the pipes like radiator ghosts and went to bed at an hour that would have made her a better person if she’d been the kind of person who believed hours held moral weight.

At two, a car alarm yelled not about crime but about loneliness. At three, the radiator coughed its small cough. At four, the letters in her brain lined up and asked to be let into sentences. She let some of them. She left some out. She wrote: chapter three is not the one where we learn how to stop loving. She wrote, in a softer hand: I am trying to work out who the villain is and I keep drawing arrows back to the mirror. She wrote, tucked near the edge of the page where the spiral binding nipped at her wrist, small and honest and mean to only herself: I am good at watching. That will not be enough, soon.

Outside, the town made the laugh that fair rides make when they are taken down and packed into trucks. Outside, a postman on a bike thought of the time he had wanted to leave and had not and wondered whether the wanting or the staying had altered him more. Outside, the water tower’s new stripe faded one shade in order to become more itself. Outside, a giant lay down in a place we can argue about and listened to the names in her chest like a mother listens to a baby who does not cry in order to be loved. Inside, a woman put her hand over the place her heart had learned to thud on schedule, and waited for morning to tell her what to do.Chapter Five

The morning after HELD arrived on the jail, the word hovered in Dr. M’s mouth like a lozenge she couldn’t quite dissolve. Held: the way a hand cups a face when both people are almost brave, the way a jar keeps peaches that were once heat and tree, the way a cell remembers the shape of a body even after it is vacuumed and bleached. In her class she wrote H E L D in chalk block letters that felt childish and not, and underneath, without flourish, she wrote the synonyms the town would not reach for first: carried, kept, cradled, detained. The students eyed the list as if looking for a trap they could all leap over together. The boy with the guitar fingerpads, blue at the brows and trying not to be a sermon, said, “It’s like the word won a fight,” and a girl in the corner whose eyebrows were ordinary but who had carved blue moons into her sneakers with a pen nodded as if she had thought the same but had been unwilling to be first. Outside, a maintenance crew used a power washer on the courthouse steps and the water spread in a fan and then fell back, obedient to gravity and to the limits of their hose.

She avoided the jail on purpose for a day because a word like that deserves at least twenty-four hours of not being viewed through glass. It needs to sink, to find the pipes in a building and lie down along them like a length of blue vein. She walked instead to the farmer’s market and stood at the end of the Eppley table where the jar sat like a sermon with a visible endpoint. There was a stack of pamphlets that had learned the town and now had creases where the same hand had handled them every Saturday. The pharmacist, who had been deputized into the role of cosmetic savior and was slightly regretting the paperwork part, smiled at her with a professional’s calm and said, “Good morning, Doctor,” as if good could be an agreement. A boy of nine with eyebrows too fine to hold anything permanent stood on tiptoe and breathed on the jar until his mother told him to leave science alone. Farther down the row, a woman already blue at the brows bought honey from a man who called her ma’am and meant it like a compliment; the honey caught light and made a gold you could argue with and never win.

At the Eppley booth a sign had sprouted in a practised hand: ASK ABOUT CONSENT. The word was becoming a currency. People moved it around, spent it on arguments, saved it for later. “We offer free consultations,” said the pharmacist in a tone that tried to be lotion and almost made it. “No obligation. We want everyone to feel empowered.” Empowered is a word like laminate; it sticks to whatever you press it on and gives off a smooth shine. Dr. M said, “And if the blue, say, wasn’t something that happened to them but something they are glad to have happen?” The pharmacist looked at the jar again, as if she might find an answer at the bottom like tea leaves that had been poured wrong. “Choice is still choice,” she said, and meant it, and somewhere a teenager whose nails were bitten down to the quick decided not to show up for their appointment to try the solvent, and somewhere else a different teenager went in and did, and breathed through the sting that came up as lightly as embarrassment.

The city did not sleep through the Inauguration of the Word. People took pictures of HELD and made it their profile pictures. An old woman whose husband had died on a wet night when a truck did not hit the brakes touched the letters with her ungloved fingers and then touched her own forehead as if words were contagious in that direction too. A man in a tie wrote an email to the council with subject line BLUEBROW VANDALISM and attached two photographs: one of the jail’s new signage, one of his teenage son sipping coffee and looking at the world like it was cracking open just enough to let some air in. He did not see that he had sent his heart along with his argument. Someone in the comments wrote: it’s paint. Someone wrote: it’s not paint if it’s a petition. It turns out you can fight with nouns and no one bleeds for hours.

Lynette moved the way she always moved, with so much attention the attention itself made you ache. She did small things no one was keeping a ledger for. She lifted a telephone wire that had sagged dangerously across a back alley so that the truck someone had borrowed from someone’s cousin could pass without losing its curl of lights. She shifted a branch that had thought about breaking in last night’s wind and then decided not to because the morning looked like it could use a good tree. She pressed her hand, later, against the brick lip of a school where children come to be sorted into palatable shapes, and the brick did not soften but the air did. The intake in her chest did not waver, exactly, but it found a new rhythm, fast and then measured, as if getting used to a song a town had just learned to hum together.

In her office, under the faux-wood bulletin board where announcements for readings and workshops were tacked in layers like sedimentary rock, Dr. M found a note stuck into the corner of a poem about cows that had been weathering badly since spring. The paper had been ripped from a composition notebook; the tear was jagged in the way only spines left too long in a backpack can produce. The handwriting slanted one way and then the other, a person practicing being decisive. It read: MY BOYFRIEND DOESN’T HAVE EYEBROWS BECAUSE HE SHAVED THEM IN EIGHTH GRADE AND THEY NEVER REALLY CAME BACK AND HE FEELS INVISIBLE AT THE GROCERY STORE AND VISIBLE AT THE PARTY. IS HE LESS CHOSEN. IS HE LESS. Dr. M put the note under a magnet shaped like an orange slice and answered in the next class in the only way she could without lying: “The blue can’t decide whether you are chosen. That isn’t its job. Your body is not a ballot box. You can stop voting.”

In public, Dr. M began to be approached as if she had been deputized to hold the giant’s purse. A man with a daughter and a tight jaw asked if she could tell the giant to move out beyond the corn and splurge the sky so it would rain. A girl who needed to spit and couldn’t brought her spitless mouth and said, “Make her write my grandmother’s name somewhere.” A city councilman, who had learned to say which side of his mouth to speak out of depending on who was clapping, emailed to ask if she would serve on the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents. She replied with a sentence that had the word deflect in it and went back to arranging sentences in a way that felt like keeping sparrows from bumping into windows.

Farouq, whose body had found a gear between young and not, texted her at midnight a photo of the water tower with a new line like a heartbeat halfway up. Under it he wrote: she’s measuring herself, or us? Dr. M wrote back: both, probably, and he responded with a string of hearts he would have called corny last year and now wore like a jacket he could not believe fit. He held another Browbeat and this time a boy whose foster placement had lasted four weekends stood and said into the microphone, “If I had had blue when I was little, maybe someone would have fought for me with, like, teeth,” and people shifted on their chairs and then someone finally clapped because the silence was too heavy not to break. A woman with hair the color of arguments read a piece about how her daughter’s blue had made her mother nice for exactly two days and then the nice had burned off like fog and left what it had always been in place. “We take the blue personally,” the woman said into the mic, “but maybe this is a municipal project and not a therapy dog,” and Dr. M wrote that down because it was too good and too true and too cruel not to keep.

There were other, smaller, hymnals to the blue. Someone painted eyebrows on pumpkins and set them in a row on a porch and the cat knocked them all down in one vindictive swipe. A high school art teacher, newly marked at the temple like a blessing someone had missed by an inch, put a bin of blue pencils by her classroom door with a sign that said: USE THESE FOR YOURSELF ONLY. They disappeared and returned like tide. A kid on a school bus practiced the math of looking out the window and not at the boys whose faces had become flags, and finally turned and said, “You look like superheroes, kind of,” and the boy with the best blue scowled and said, “We’re tired of being metaphors. We still have to do algebra.” It was a living, this town; it was doing it.

She went to the jail because you cannot write HELD down twice and call yourself thorough. The building looked worse the closer she got, as buildings whose job includes sorrow often do. The blue at the door had dried to a matte she trusted; it had lost the swagger of something newly applied and settled into its slow vocation. A man in a uniform watched her look; he had the kind of face that professions grow on you after time—tired, obliging, strangely tender. She said, “I teach at the university,” and he said, “They told me people were going to come and stare,” and then he shrugged, as if a stare could be a tithe a town pays and he could live with being collection plate. Through the glass of intake she watched a woman’s hair be measured with a comb, saw the woman smirk at nothing and then pull her face back into seriousness like a drawstring. In the waiting room a child slept with her mouth open on a chair and her grandmother put a sweater over her like a moral. On the wall a poster urged anyone with an opioid habit to start now the work of finishing. Someone had taped an index card under it with three words and a phone number: I CAN HELP. She put her fingers against the H of HELD the way people in a museum put their fingers against the air in front of a painting when they forget themselves and wish to own it for half a second. The concrete took her body heat and gave nothing back.

“What are you writing?” asked the uniformed man, not unkindly, like a father giving a kid an easy rope to tug a story all the way out with.

“I am trying to name the part of us that wants to fix signal so badly we make it worse,” she said, and he laughed once through his nose because who hasn’t tried to call a person back by texting them four times in a row. “I am trying to write down the way a town learns to dress a wound without making it a landmark.”

“You got a way with that,” he said, and put his hand to his head as if checking his hat, as if it mattered that his blue smudge might still be there for his daughter to ask about at dinner. “You want to go in?” he asked, and she shook her head. It was enough, that day, to stand outside and agree that words can hold people and let them go in the same afternoon.

Her radiator held its breath and pretended to die for two minutes that night, then shuddered back to life with a sound like applause withheld. She lay down without undressing and put the pillow with the handprint under the bed because sometimes love is a glare in the dark and you need your eyes. At three she woke because the weather had come to collect on something it had promised in August. The thunder moved in the way older people dance: bold, amused, not in a hurry to impress. She watched the flashes turn her ceiling into a dictionary page and pretended she could read definition into the light. The rain began as if someone had finally said yes to a question it had been awkward to ask. The town sighed. The gutters did their work. Somewhere, a teenager who had shaved her eyebrows in defiance touched her own smooth face and felt, for the first time that week, plain and thrilled. Somewhere, a woman with blue brows kissed a man she would leave in a month and remembered that nothing you do under the sign of miracle will save you from the necessity of also doing mundane bravery.

The next day the rumor said that Lynette had been seen atop the mall, lying on her back with her hands behind her head, as if she had taken a day pass from being an omen. The rumor said she had laughed when she sneezed. The rumor said she had stroked the letter E on the JC Penney sign like a person touches a piano key they once played well. That evening, in the lot outside the Meijer that had its own weather and its own astrophysics because of how big the lights were, Dr. M stood with a shopping cart and tried to remember what she had come for. Milk. Coffee. A spray bottle for misting the plant that kept insisting on reaching toward a window that hadn’t given it anything but stingy sun in months. She saw the Eppley woman pushing a cart with too much cereal in it, as if for a family or a cadre of interns. The woman’s ponytail had slackened by one ambition. She recognized Dr. M without any natural pleasure and with the professional disappointment of an argument that refused a stage.

“You were very effective at that meeting,” the Eppley woman said, which is a thing people say when they mean, you took the attention I expected to leave with in my pocket.

“You brought a solvent to a parade,” said Dr. M, and then felt herself blush because she had meant it wittier than it was. “People aren’t stains.”

“But paint is paint,” the woman said, and then, because both of them had been raised to nod at each other’s competence even when disagreeing, she added, “We could study it together.” Her eyes were not unkind. They glittered with the ferocity of someone who had chosen a life where they would have to be a salesman in every room, even their own bathroom mirror. “If we could take a sample from somewhere—your pillow, say—if we could figure out—”

“If I have to let you in my room to prove my argument, then I’ve already lost,” said Dr. M, and watched the woman pretend not to have heard the intimacy of the word room. “Besides, she asked me not to turn her into a villain. I don’t think she’d like to be turned into a reagent either.”

“Villains sell,” the Eppley woman said in a tone that was half caution, half envy. “So do cures.”

They parted near the giant bins of bulk onions, each of them double-checking their list, each of them carrying something invisible in the basket under the cart. At the register a teenage boy with a pin that read TRAINEE said to Dr. M as he bagged, “Do you think it’s gonna be over soon?” and she said, “I don’t know if it is a thing that ends,” and he said, “I want to go back to not thinking about my face,” and she said, “I think that might be one of the things you don’t get to go back to,” and he folded the bag as if it needed hiding.

On the day the Homecoming parade wound down Green Street with its usual combination of auditions and apology, people lined up with lawn chairs and coolers like a river that had agreed to go slow for the afternoon. Step teams practiced a last-minute clap. A float with an actual hay bale made liability lawyers steel themselves for letters later. The marching band wore hats that made them taller, which is what hats like that are for. The football team did their best not to look ridiculous on a wagon that had been decorated by the parent who had remembered to bring glitter. The girls on the court didn’t wave like queens; they waved like girls who had practiced a wave and found it silly and were now doing it anyway because life is a rehearsal until it isn’t. Dr. M stood halfway down the block in the shade of a tree that had figured out how to keep eleven leaves green in defiance of the season and beside her stood a man with a dog who had understood, through no fault of her own, that crowds might require her to be patient. The sky did a trick the sky does that people who don’t live under it might think was magic. The clouds parted as if a hand had lifted a curtain to see who was down there making all that noise.

The first blue came not down but sideways, threading between buildings like a laugh shared between conspirators. It arced low and brushed the top of the tuba section and then climbed, evasive and flirtatious, toward the overhanging balcony where a group of seniors had set up a lookout with a bowl of pretzels and a single bottle of terrible champagne. It hung a second above the float that carried the homecoming court and two chaperones who had the exhausted eyes of people the town would not stop asking favors of. The girls closed their eyes out of instinct, and a boy put his hand up like a visor, and the blue skipped them and marked instead the horse’s plume, which was ludicrous and perfect. The horse snorted and was less interested than anyone else. The sheriff stood on a corner with his hat in his hand and a woman from the PTA told him loudly that she knew a guy who could get the banner clean, and he said, “We’re going to leave it there,” and his voice contained a tired he had earned.

Then something careless and ordinary happened a block away, as if to justify everyone’s suspicion that doom is mundane. A car whose driver had tried to take a shortcut turned wrong and found the parade where the driver’s plan had been. The car was not malicious. The car was a car. The driver lifted her hands away from the wheel for a second because she had been taught to regret before she had been taught to steer. The drumline turned the corner and for a heartbeat nobody was yet wrong and nobody was yet hurt. The blue came like breath before a word. It came foam-first, the ridiculous cousin of seriousness, a blossom and then a sheet, a drape like a new-ceilinged room, and it landed between car and kids and did the unscientific thing of stopping the world long enough to let it remember itself. The bumper hit foam and the foam said, no, sweetly and firmly. The drummers took three backward steps with the precision of people who practice moving their bodies together. A cymbal player let out a high laugh like something had been tickled inside his ribs. The driver put her forehead on her steering wheel and did not honk and then cried because she had come very close to becoming a person a town remembers angrily for longer than it should.

A woman near Dr. M put her hand to her throat and touched her necklace like a line, as if making sure she was attached to her body. A kid, nine maybe, blue only in his mind, said, “Did you see that,” and by did you see that he meant, Did you see you are not always abandoned. Lynette’s shadow tilted on the building in a way that made it seem she had leaned down from a place only birds use. She did not show herself in the theatrical way; she did what she had always done: managed the world around the edges so the edges would do less harm. The foam dissolved faster than anyone expected and left a taste in the air like a cheap candle that you love because it reminds you of an aunt who smelled like better.

“I don’t know how I would explain this in a memo,” said a man behind Dr. M in a tie loosened to an acceptable degree for a Saturday. “You don’t,” said his wife, who had been the kind of teen who never got elected to anything and is now the kind of adult who knows almost everything. “You bring cupcakes to the next meeting and you say we were lucky.” The band moved on. The horse thumped his hooves in a rhythm that would have been a rhythm even without the drumline. The teenagers on the float leaned their heads together and tried to make a moment into a future and the moment, kindly, did not oblige.

After, at the library where a program promised READ TO A DOG and meant it, children sat on carpet squares and practiced the art of placing their voices somewhere soft. A golden retriever of a temperament saints envy lay down with a sigh as if he had been doing things all day more difficult than staying in a warm place and being adored. A boy with newly blue brows held a book about a hungry caterpillar like a contract and read the way nine-year-olds do, breathless on the wrong words. The dog blinked and took in the boy. In the corner a librarian, who had been living lately on coffee and the ability to put her hair up with a pencil, closed her eyes for seven seconds the way people pray when they no longer know how to pray out loud. On the community board a flyer for the subcommittee had been pinned with three tacks that did not match, because cores of bureaucracy still kept the old injustice of mismatched supplies.

She did not sleep much anymore, or rather sleep came in and out like tide with a preference for the hours when human beings want to be otherwise. In the small hours she wrote a letter to Lynette she would not deliver. It said: I have been writing about you as if you are a metaphor because metaphors are the only giant thing I have tools for. It said: you are a person, and I do not know what moral obligations I owe a person who is also an event. It said: I am trying to tell the truth without making a weapon from your body. It said: I have loved stories to the point of hurting the thing being told. It said, smaller: I am tired of myself.

In the morning she went to the mosque with a scarf she did not know how to tie and someone helped her without making it a lesson. She sat on the women’s side and watched people treat their bodies as tools and not as problems. The imam had a voice like good bread. He spoke about looking up and finding the sky exactly where it had always been and everyone understood what he meant without anyone saying her name. A toddler in tiny sweatpants escaped his mother’s hand and walked toward the prayer row and a woman who was not his mother put two fingers gently on his shoulder and guided him back with a kindness that should have its own noun. As they put their shoes back on, a teenage girl with blue eyebrows and eyeliner with a wing sharp enough to cut a pose smiled at Dr. M like a person recognizes a regular they have never taken money from. “She was outside last night,” the girl said, and meant the giant and not God. Her voice did not shake even though she had spent a year using it for less.

“Does she make you feel seen?” asked Dr. M, and the girl snorted, a delicacy. “She makes everybody feel like they know how tall they are,” she said, and then, “My dad says he doesn’t want to live in a town with a monster, and my mom says we already do,” and then she put her headphones back on because two parents is a lot of weather.

A week of rain gave the town shapes they had forgotten: puddles that reflected circles when someone threw a pebble, ditches that carried their water like contraband they would distribute later to lawns unworthy of saving. People forgot the smell of dust and remembered instead how clothing smells when it has been hung to dry in a kitchen. In that wet week, blue streaks appeared in places the giant could not have reached except by imagination: the undersides of footbridges, the lip of the bandstand in West Side Park, the rim of the fountain where someone had tied a ribbon for a cause no one could agree on. She was marking places. She was listening. She was reading the town’s mind like a map and only writing on the parts everyone drove past without remorse.

Children started playing a game called Held. It involved one child standing with arms out and the others running at them as if to be stopped and the held child deciding, in a second, whether to say no and hold or turn and accept and be knocked down. There were rules that were never written and all of them had to do with the gentleness of falling. A boy with a haircut his mother did with her own hands stood up after a particularly well enacted held and said, “That’s what she’s doing,” and another kid said, “She’s not catching,” and the first said, “She can’t catch everything,” and then they went in to wash their hands for dinner and it took twenty minutes because children always find a way to make water into a festival.

The Eppley solvent became another thing on a list people kept on the back of their minds: call dentist, pick up dry cleaning, decide whether to deactivate chromophores. Mothers formed factions without admitting it, the way people form bracket pools. There were Facebook groups with names like EYES UP and BLUE AND TRUE and LET KIDS CHOOSE. A woman whose political portfolio included rage and casseroles went door to door with a stack of consent forms that meant nothing and everything. “Do you consent to being seen,” she asked at one door, and the man said, “I thought I did until now,” and she laughed and took his signature anyway because people like her are the ones who keep a town moving from one story to the next without losing too many along the way.

On a Thursday afternoon that looked like any Thursday, a man who called himself a radio personality and who had kept the job because he knew when not to say what was in his mouth said into a mic: “We’ve got Doctor Mariani with us today to talk about our very own big-hearted blue-browed bruha—” and then caught himself in time to not live on that sentence forever. She sat across from him and watched him reach for a joke and put it down with, for him, astonishing grace. “You’ve been watching this from the start,” he said, and she said, “I’ve been watching people watch it,” and he leaned in as if that were the angle that mattered. “What do we do now,” he asked in the voice men have learned to use when they are ready to be forgiven, “when the world is different from the one we arranged ourselves to live in?” There was feedback in her headphones that made the question seem like it had asked itself twice. She could have said policy. She could have said prayer. She said, “We keep allowing the kids to tell us what hurts and what doesn’t and believe them both,” and the radio made the smallest noise a machine can make when it realizes it has accidentally done something holy.

She heard from a cousin she had not spoken to in eight years, a woman with two kids and a faith that had not bent when it might have been easier. The cousin wrote an email that began, I’ve been following your giant, as if one could be genealogically connected to a phenomenon, and then told her a long, mild story about a girl in their town whose forehead had been marked with something she couldn’t wash away, and how the town had turned that mark into a program with a budget and how the budget had saved exactly three people in one year and exactly no one the next and how sometimes what you can do is not a verdict on what you should. “Do you have someone to eat dinner with,” the cousin asked at the end, not as a trap, not as pity, just as a question, and Dr. M wrote back, I have a plant and a teenager who brings me Gushers, and the cousin wrote, that counts.

The rumor insisted on being relevant. It said: she was seen with her ear against the wall of the school like a doctor with a stethoscope to a barrel. It said: she put her finger to her mouth in a shh at a couple fighting in the parking lot of the diner so earnestly they stopped mid-syllable and then laughed at themselves until the laughter took over the fight’s real estate. It said: she lay down in a field and covered her face with her hands like a child playing and the corn rustled as if covering her with a blanket. It said: she is tired. It said: she is not tired, she is charging. It said: she can’t run out as long as we do not. People wrote that in places their friends would see and felt like they had done something about the weather.

Late one evening, when the tomato plants in the community garden wore heavy fruits like secrets and the rabbits pretended they had not been involved, Dr. M met Lynette there because Pilar had said, “She likes the smell of the vines when they’re green,” and children know where gods prefer to stand. The giant crouched with her knees like folded scaffolding and watched a worm glimmer itself out of a patch of cracked dirt into soil that would be kinder. Her intake was busy; she sounded like a city at a distance. Dr. M did not bow, because naked awe had never been her style, but she stood straighter than usual. She felt her own posture the way a dancer must; it mattered in the presence of someone invented to make an angle out of air.

“You’re marking the places,” Dr. M said, and it was not a question, it was gratitude baked into a statement.

“I am letting the ground confess,” said Lynette. “You had it all written down in your walking anyway. I am cleaning up your penmanship.” She smiled and the tomatoes in the nearest cage seemed, for a second, to lean like small worshippers.

“Will you mark me,” said Dr. M, as if ordering a drink slowly, syllable by syllable, to make sure she did not mispronounce the part that would turn the bartender either kind or cruel.

“Yes,” said Lynette, and then, “No,” and then, “I have. I will. I won’t. You are already.” The giant lifted a thumb and pressed it gently against the inside of Dr. M’s wrist, the skin that had held a thousand betrayals and a thousand small courtesies from strangers who had handed her change carefully. When she took her thumb away there was the faintest fog of blue, as if someone had breathed a color onto her. It did not last. It did not need to. Her heart struck her ribs like a child knocking to be let from a closet where they had gone to see what bravery felt like.

“Everybody keeps asking me to stop her,” a man had told Dr. M at the hardware store that afternoon as he filled a paper bag with screws and a quiet hopelessness. “I’m a man who makes fences,” he said. “I don’t know how to make fences that keep out tenderness.” In the garden, she said to Lynette, “You are teaching us how to be held,” and Lynette shook her head in that slow, stately way that made the gesture an essay. “No,” she said. “You are remembering.”

The night wore down to its thinness. The garden’s little flags on toothpicks, which had been pretending to matter all season, snapped in a small wind. Somewhere behind them a train complained its way across the town’s spine. “You will not write me as a miracle,” said the giant, and Dr. M heard the plea in it, the professional desire to be taken seriously even while being used by the gods. “No,” said Dr. M, and the word was a promise she felt like a weight. “A manual, maybe,” she said, and Lynette laughed and the tomatoes leaned again and Dr. M did not try to capture it with a camera because some things you cannot paragraph without killing.

The next day Pilar came by with her legal pad bent and thick with new ink. She had made columns: what I think, what I know, what I hope. In the first column she had written, adults need this more than us sometimes, and in the second, blue doesn’t hurt, and in the third, that when I am older I will not forget how to look. She had drawn tiny eyebrows in the margin, all different moods. She put the pad on the table with a thump like a book reporting for duty. “Do you want to come with me to the fair again tonight,” she asked, casual in the way twelve-year-olds are when they are begging for companionship and pretending not to care. “I want to watch the teenagers watch the teenagers,” she said, and Dr. M understood the way a person understands the instructions for putting a dresser together even if none of the pieces quite look like the drawing.

They stood by the ferris wheel and watched the couples trust the machinery, watched the way hands find each other when bodies are suspended. A boy with eyebrows the color of a bruise in a place you can’t show held the hand of a boy who would, in a week, tell him he was scared of the world and show it by not calling. A girl in a dress she had haggled out of a thrift store’s back rack looked up and missed the kiss and then got it when the car came back down and did not die. The weather was so sure of itself the hair on people’s arms lay flat. “Do you think she gets tired of liking us,” Pilar asked, voice small enough that it might have been a soup spoon. “We’re not that easy.”

“I think she is practicing being a person,” said Dr. M, both meaning it and not, “and that is the longest job there is.” The giant was not visible. The giant was a rumor that had decided to take the night off for the sake of everyone’s blood pressure. The blue hung about wholesale as if reconsidering where it would look best in the morning. A little boy licked blue cotton candy and then looked at his fingers, and chose not to wipe them on his shirt, and his mother loved him so much in that second she had to sit down.

At home, later, the radiator did not cough. It breathed like a cat that has found the right spot on a blanket and will not move despite the existence of the universe. She stood in the tiny rectangle of her kitchen and considered the beans on the stove, the plant that had learned to accept what it was offered, the pillowcase she had folded and put on a top shelf the way people put their good jewelry. She took the pillowcase down. She held it up so the blue handprint was opposite her face and then she did the simplest good thing she had done in months: she took it back to bed and slept with her cheek on it as if sleeping on that particular past would make a better morning. The dream did not come. She woke without trembling and made coffee and did not sweeten it. She went to her desk before her email could ask for her and wrote, finally: Chapter Five. She wrote: We widen. She wrote: A town remembers. She wrote: A woman is a plural. She wrote: I am trying. Then she went out into a day that had decided, for once, to be straightforward. The sky wore its blue uncomplicated, the buses kept their schedules like stiff upper lips, and somewhere a giant lifted one more low wire that had been waiting to take the wrong head off.Chapter Seven

By the time the maples had given up and left their red where shoes could carry it inside, the word on the jail had become part of the directions people gave. Turn left at HELD, they said, as if love and detention could be a landmark the same way as the Dairy Queen. The students in Dr. M’s classes began to date the semester by which public thing had turned blue last. A boy in a hoodie said mid-discussion, “Remember before the bandstand?” and someone else said, “That was like a week before the courthouse steps, I think,” and they were wrong, and they were right in the way memory is right: it organizes itself into the order that wounds heal, not the order that calendars keep. The town’s sentences had absorbed the nouns. The verbs were next.

It was in the rotunda at the Statehouse where the air smelled like grant money and old speeches that someone decided to make a hearing. The committee chairs wore ties their spouses had ironed like ultimatums. The folding chairs made a sound when they opened that brought school gyms to mind, which was a kind of humility even when nobody meant it. The Governor did not come. He sent a man with a jaw like a door who said words that fit into any afternoon, like bipartisan and framework, and the words floated up and got caught in the chandelier’s complicated ribs. Dr. M sat three rows back with a spiral notebook whose curl had learned to make indents on her wrist. The Eppley woman spoke first, crisp as a celery heart, about chromophores and voluntary protocols and an opportunity for public-private partnership that made three men in the front row exhale like the word partnership had just paid last month’s rent. A mother spoke who had painted her own eyebrows blue in solidarity and had discovered that her daughter did not want a twin so much as a witness; the mother said, “I thought I was joining her boat but I was steering it without asking,” and the room did not applaud because applause would have hurt the sentence.

Albert, hat in hand and nervous system honed by early mornings, cleared his throat and told them all about the hand on the dumpster as if that hand were the only brief he had brought. He said, “I didn’t look up for twenty-two years and that’s on me,” and a man with a pen stopped clicking it because sometimes shame is contagious in a good way. He told them about the stripe on the silo and how his route now included it even though it never had before, how it had changed the time it took him to do his job not at all and his sense of what a job is completely. When he sat down, a woman with a bang of hair that suggested competence leaned forward and asked, gently, “Mr. M., do you support state action to remediate unauthorized markings on public infrastructure?” and he said, “I support learning to call a mark a memory,” and the stenographer typed that like a person entering a foreign word they had been taught to respect.

They asked Dr. M up and she went because her body had learned that declining reshapes an afternoon and she did not have the kind of energy reshaping takes. She said into the microphone that kettled her voice, “I teach how words become bodies when enough of us carry them,” and saw the Eppley woman’s mouth twist into an almost-smile that said: you know how to do this too. She spoke about witnesses and archives and the difference between reversing and repenting. She said, “The blue is not a bruise you can soothe with money,” and the committee member with the creased tie winced in a way that made her want to say sorry and did not. When they asked if she knew where Lynette slept, she said, “Of course,” watching their eyes widen before she added, “In us,” and the room made a simultaneous mistake with its mouth and almost laughed. She felt cruel for the instinct to make a joke halfway down the stairs of her seriousness and kinder for catching it by the collar and turning it into a point. After, in the echoing hall where interns practice looking purposeful, a young woman with a staff badge whispered, “My eyebrows never took it, but I still think of washing my face as telling her something,” and Dr. M touched the girl’s shoulder with three fingers the way strangers can when the rules loosen.

It was not all hearings and hymns to municipal process. At the high school, the art teacher with the mark at her temple curated an exhibit called Visible, hung in the cafeteria where curry and chlorine had seeped into the walls as if smell could be paint. Kids made self-portraits that refused the name selfie and used as much blue as the supply closet could offer. A boy who had been, all his life, told to make himself small so other people could fit, drew his face too big for the paper on purpose, the brows a horizon line he dared you to misinterpret. A girl whose blue had faded in the dry heat of the school’s winter vents made a collage in which her eyebrows were two small rivers feeding one larger river and taped beneath it, in block letters that had kissed a ruler: I AM HOT AND COLD AT ONCE. At parent night a woman paused in front of a piece in which the only blue was a postage-stamp-sized square in the middle of a forehead, and she said something to her son about minimalism in the tones she used when she did not want to admit to complicated feelings, and he shrugged in the dialect of sixteen and walked on.

When the first frost finally took the crabgrass’ arrogance, the blue did a trick science could not publish without inviting ridicule. In the crisp, the brows went faint, as if asleep, and in kitchens where kettles hissed and bathrooms where showers fogged mirrors, they darkened again, reasserting, like ink reappearing under lemon heat. An entire thread appeared on the town subreddit about humidity and dye bonds and someone wrote, “It’s like kindness, it goes farther when the air lets it,” and immediately deleted it because they had been sincere spontaneously in public and remembered themselves too soon. Eppley pivoted, as companies do, to winter dry skin. Their booth at the farmers’ market put out a bowl of free hand cream with a scent that wanted to be oat and almost got there, and the pharmacist smiled her professional smile and said, “We’re here when you want choices,” to no one in particular. Someone taped a sign to their banner at dawn, in a hand like a left turn: ABSENCE IS LOUD TOO, and the pharmacist left it up because she had, lately, found herself practicing new sports in which leaving small messes where people could see them counted as exercise.

On campus a protest braided itself into a vigil which braided itself into a dance. Students chalked the walkways with eyebrows that grinned and scowled and frowned in sympathy. A counter-group in crisp windbreakers handed out solvent coupons like a faith tract, and a girl with eyeliner that could slice bread took one and folded it into a paper crane without breaking eye contact. It felt, briefly, like theatre; then a boy with a megaphone said too loud a thing about choice that landed like a plate thrown at a family dinner, and a freshman cried in a way that the ground heard but cameras, clumsy as they are, did not. Lynette did not come in as a climax. She moved behind the bell tower where nobody not paying attention would see, lifted the sagging banner that said MUTUAL AID in letters somebody had kissed with their thumb, and tied it higher. The wind readjusted its sermon. When the crowd moved into song because they had to do something, the song had no chorus and needed one, and someone from the back who had never once wanted to lead counted them in with a hand that had been waiting to point since fifth grade.

If you were keeping track, which Dr. M was even when she tried to let a day be a day, you would have noticed how the places began to outnumber the faces. The library’s side door, the one addicts used because the front felt like a test, wore a neat little line overhead that made everybody look up as they ducked in. The bus stop outside the shelter where the city performed its tidy generosity received the shape of a small eyebrow on its plexi, so slight that it took you a week to realize it had never been there before. On the asphalt outside the grocery store’s employee entrance, a careful word appeared at knee-height the night an assistant manager caught a boy pocketing a burger and chose not to call the police. It said: LEFT, and quickly, below it, because we are not a city that wastes a double meaning, someone else wrote: ALONE, and a third unknown hand, tired of the way coyness can hurt, added: BE. The maintenance men at the courthouse stopped pretending they did not see and began collecting the words on a clipboard like species observed on a long walk. When their supervisor asked what for, they shrugged because sometimes a collection is its own rationale if you’re the sort of person who can stand a corner going unbleached.

Pilar got in trouble, which had been coming like weather. She had cut a set of eyebrow stencils out of cereal boxes and carried Blue Beauty school-bathroom eyeshadow in her backpack and had been offering blue to anyone who asked, under the hand dryer that had never dried anything on time. The principal called it graffiti and said the word with a careful disdain that suggested he had learned to be polite to nouns in the seventies and never quite trusted them again. In the office that had a carpet the color of defeat, he offered her a pamphlet about choices, as if choices were a meal plan and she had missed breakfast. Dr. M, called in because Pilar had written her name under emergency contacts as if it were a spell, sat in the plastic chair that had been designed in a golden age of back pain and kept her face in the friendly neutral you offer to bureaucrats like a peace treaty. She said, “Pilar is participating in an ongoing community art intervention,” and watched the principal’s face try to decide if intervention made this witchcraft or medicine. Pilar did not smile. She had learned from the giant that earnestness should not have to be cute to survive. She said, “I’m helping people put on their faces,” and when he said, “We don’t allow makeup sharing,” she said, “It’s not that kind of blue,” and the office secretary, writing nothing and hearing everything, made a sound she concealed as a cough.

Afterward, on the steps, Pilar asked if she was in trouble with Dr. M instead of the school, because the opinions of the two categories do not share a weight class. Dr. M said, “I am in favor of people choosing their adjectives,” and Pilar nodded as if that were a sentence to take into a quiz. “Next time,” Dr. M added, “maybe you put out a sign-up sheet for who wants to be painted so no one can call it coercion,” and Pilar rolled her eyes and said, “Fine,” and then, as if she had carried a small rock in her pocket all day and was finally tired of its shape, added, “Everybody always thinks you’re trying to make them be something. I was just trying to help people look like they already are.” She sat with her knees banged together in the way of children who have not yet learned that their bodies do not need to apologize to furniture. Dr. M slumped beside her because sometimes solidarity is a posture before it is a policy.

The thing about love as fuel is that transactional people will immediately try to meter it. Two tech boys with a start-up name that sounded like a breath test launched an app that purported to index the town’s acts of tenderness into a daily charge percentage for Lynette. They called it KILOLUX and their interface was beautiful the way a new knife is beautiful, and for a day the feed filled with little pings of BE KIND and TAKE OUT THE TRASH FOR YOUR ROOMMATE and DON’T HONK and someone even wrote TURN BACK AND SAY SORRY TO YOURSELF and the bar climbed and the boys did a live demo in a coffee shop where the lattes would not know how to be embarrassed until they got home. The next morning the app crashed under the weight of what it did not know how to count, and the boys posted a note saying something about scaling, and a girl with blue brows shot a video in her car whispering into her phone, “You can’t trick love into showing up by standing on the lawn and making airplane signals,” and it got shared a hundred thousand times by the noisiest people in quiet bedrooms.

On a two-lane out past St. Joseph, the deer did what deer do and stepped into an idea without asking traffic to agree to it. A truck did what trucks do and missed by inches nobody owns. Lynette did what she had been practicing—she softened a second and let one horn catch foam, and the foam refused fracture, and driver and deer both ran like people who had been allowed to stay alive. The next day, painted on the asphalt at a height tire spray wears at, the word SLOW appeared, blue like a refutation of yellow, and drivers read it with one quarter of the attention they ought and one quarter more than usual. A county crew came with their scrapers and a solvent that smelled like high school and got nowhere. They left a cone and a sign that said WORK IN PROGRESS and a boy who had learned to walk between cones and poems took that as a joke and told it to three friends.

It would have flattered the town to be hunted, and it tried to deserve it. Men came with nets and jargon who had worked in wildlife management before they learned to say asset capture. They set up on top of the parking garage with gear for whales, as if their metaphor could drag this into their field. When Lynette rounded the corner by the train tracks with less ceremony than they had rehearsed, the men threw, and the net, obedient, draped and slipped and caught the flag pole on the roof and unfurled itself as a hammock across the top tier of the structure. Three teenagers who hadn’t got to be children long enough climbed laughing into it and took selfies that made their mothers yell and then keep and then, later, show to women who would get it. The men coiled their rope and tried not to look the way men look when their equipment reveals which parts were for show. Down on the street, Dr. M shook her head in a motion that contained no malice and a bilious amusement, and the sheriff, whose fingers had not faded entirely, said to no one in particular, “She’s not a parade float,” and then blushed because he had been thinking of homecoming again.

The parts of her chest that had sounded like a radio down the hall grew louder in the ear of anyone willing to press their cheek to their own ordinary. Dr. M began to hear verbs in the static. Help, yes, and go, yes, and stay most often, the town’s favorite palindrome. One night by the flyover where trucks bellow grief for sport, she put her hand near to Lynette’s ribs in a rapprochement with touch she had avoided for politeness and heard a new one: Enough. It came like breath that had been practicing discipline. Enough, not as in a limit, but as in: you are. She wrote it down crooked in her notebook because her hand had refused to look like calm.

The invitation came from a dean three time zones away with a subject line that had sworn it would be casual and had practiced. We would love you here, it said, and then offered money in the way a good school does when it has more than it needs and believes it can buy cleverness. They wanted her for a year to write a book with fewer caveats. Her cousin wrote back quickly when she forwarded the email with an ellipsis: do you need to go away to tell a story about staying. The Eppley woman, who she ran into by the bulk bins again and with whom she had developed a grudging weather report of nods, said, “Take it,” and meant, we all leave somehow and I prefer the version with plane tickets, and Dr. M bought oatmeal and went home and laid the email on her table as if paper could sweat. She said out loud to the plant, who was not obligated to answer, “What if the telling has to come from here,” and the plant went on being green in defiance of the window’s stingy policy, which was as close to counsel as anyone gets.

Farouq’s Browbeat grew legs. He moved it into the Legion hall where the flag had a swarm of gold fringe like bees around honey and where the acoustics were a rumor. He opened the night with a poem in which he apologized to his ninth-grade self for sixteen things, fifteen small and one large, and he did not specify the large because specificity is a luxury some days even for poets. A girl came who had been marked at forty and read a letter to the director of the after-school program where she had been a legend for twelve years and said, “I am tired of earning my way into rooms,” and people who had also been trained to pay admission in personality clapped until their palms hurt. A boy came who had used the solvent on one brow and left the other and sang a song with one side of his face in shadow, and Dr. M felt the town fall a little in love with him because he had turned half a face into a story and everyone loves a story we can call symmetrical even if it isn’t. After, standing by the coffee percolator that imparted an old metallic blessing to everything, the Eppley woman looked out of place and envious, and Dr. M handed her a styrofoam cup because handing someone a thing is a way to make a truce and the Eppley woman took it and said, very quietly, “I keep thinking if I figure it out people won’t hate me for having, you know, a job,” and Dr. M said, “They don’t hate you, they hate being fixed before they finish breaking,” and it sounded like the kind of truth you can only say under a flag no one is taking photographs of.

The fall got hard in the way falls get hard. The first snow came early and indecisive without sticking, like a person making a joke and then apologizing. The blue did its humidity trick in reverse, darkening in faces over radiators, retreating in cold halls, returning in locker room fog and over soup bowls where someone had learned to measure cumin by the ache in their wrist. The shelter put out more cots and more rules, because that was what they had. A tent city at the edge of the tracks grew a spine. A woman named Deb, who could thread a needle in the dark, stood on a milk crate and called out numbers like a carnival and nobody came to take their numbers away. On a Tuesday night when everything felt like a bad decision and the sky had the wrong lights, Lynette lay down along the windbreak and lifted, with her ridiculous splurge-thing, a sheet of foam that turned to something better in the cold, and draped it over the tents like winter had an aunt who had finally remembered to send the blanket. The men who had committed their stubbornness to plastic were quiet, which happens so rarely in tents that you could feel it a block away. Dr. M and Farouq walked the edge with thermoses. He had bought coffee from the diner because he liked the way the woman there said sweetie without making him regret it. They handed out cups and did not pretend the cups would solve world hunger because being honest is one of the only warmths available in quantity.

At the church with the tall point that had always told people where to look, the seniors’ choir—women mostly, shoulders square as old barns—rehearsed carols with eyebrows that would not obey style. The director, a man who had given up hair as a youthful affectation, moved his hand the way conductors do when they want you to believe your breath could make a sound behave different. The note on “comfort” came out like a question and the note on “joy” landed like a suitcase with a broken wheel and still, because this is what music does even when it is ungainly, people standing behind folding chairs thought for a second that they were in a better century. The janitor of the church, a woman who had her own keys at last, did not try to wipe the blue off the manger props. This year, she thought, the shepherds will have brows like banners. Joseph will look like a man who knows his face is being asked to carry more story than it can reasonably transport and will try anyway. She imagined the baby with the impossible skin as a paragraph too new to underline.

December decided to commit. The town wore its winter like an argument, with layers that hid and revealed in equal measure. Dr. M bought boots that pretended to be waterproof and then found out. The radiator performed its old play with new ad libs and she clapped politely at the curtain call because an appliance deserves the dignity of a thank you. At the laundromat, the attendant with the hair the color of safety kept a jar on the counter where people could put quarters for strangers and a sign that said HAVE YOU BEEN SEEN TODAY in handwriting that had learned to amuse itself in high school. Dr. M brought the pillowcase in a plain bag with the top folded over like a lunch and slid it into a machine with quarters like old rules and watched the blue handprint go around like a moon that had decided to socialize. A woman in an apron that looked like combat said, “That’ll never come out,” and Dr. M said, “I don’t want it to,” and the woman nodded in the international language of the quietly marked. When she took it out there was a child’s sock attached by static, the sock so small it made her palms ache, and she pinned it to the corkboard under a flyer that read LOST WITH DIGNITY.

At the mosque, the girl with the winged liner had started a group chat for whoever in the youth group had blue or cared to have some and the chat had become what chats do: recipes and homework and a boy’s confession that he had kissed a mirror to practice and it had not been awful, followed by forty-three blue heart emojis from someone who did not know fourteen-year-old boys find that kind of care indecent and then eventually depend on it. At Friday prayers, a grandmother whose piety was shaped like never leaving two shoes exactly side by side sat beside a teenager whose eyebrows were newly pronounced and patted her wrist with a love that did not require infrastructure. “You look like your grandad,” she whispered, and the girl, who had never met him, glowed as if introduced at a party in which she had not expected to be honored.

Somewhere between Christmas and the particular exhaustion January deposits in mailboxes with the guilt-shaped coupons, the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents released a draft of a plan nobody was required to read but many did anyway because the word plan is a drug. It proposed listening sessions and a schedule of blue-out clinics with distinct time slots and a mentorship program wherein adults with marked brows would be paired with teenagers who also had them, as if blue could be an affinity group like chess or grief. Someone had been allowed to put in a line about an art fund. Someone else had been allowed to smuggle in a line about prayer rooms. The sheriff read it in his office and drummed his fingers with the blue that had refused to fade and thought, the only plan I recognize is showing up and not yelling, and then he put his hat on because he preferred having something to do with his hands. Dr. M read it on her couch with her feet tucked under her like a lowercase g and circled the parts that seemed like an invitation and crossed out with a too-hard pencil the parts that seemed like wetsuits zipped over feelings.

They marked the foster office. It was a small word on a door lintel where no one looks until the day they are too tired to look anywhere else. It said: KEPT, and people hated it and people loved it and surface-level disagreements turned into the kind that asks a city whether it actually believes itself. A woman who had aged out of three systems she hadn’t chosen stood under it and laughed until she had to bend, like something inside had at last shaken loose. She said into the air, “Okay then,” and the air did not write it down and did not need to. In the courthouse, a judge paused with his robe half-buttoned and read HELD and KEPT and thought about the difference between verbs done to and done with and put his hand through his hair like a man trying to comb his conscience. On the third floor of an apartment building the radiator made a noise like a verdict like a mercy like a tired child pretending to be a drum.

It was at the diner, late, where the waitress had learned to call the sheriff by his first name only when he tipped well and everybody else m’am no matter their age, that Dr. M saw the Eppley woman cry. She had come alone and ordered two pancakes and a side of professionalism and received both, the pancakes arriving faster. Her ponytail had finally conceded to a clip that did not pretend to be permanent. The tears came slow and almost embarrassed of their own timing, down the neat face of a woman who had been trained by five rooms and three degrees to keep water in its pipes. Dr. M put two dollars on her own saucer and carried her coffee to the other booth without permission because sometimes you walk into a story not because you are invited but because there is a spill you can stop. She sat down and said nothing and the Eppley woman, who had never once asked anyone for help out loud because she was not the asking kind, said, after a while, “No one told me the thing I’m good at would be the thing people wanted least,” and Dr. M said, “They want to want it later, like insurance,” and the Eppley woman laughed like a hinge getting honest. They ate in a rough theatrical silence, the kind strangers share at hospitals. When they left, the bell over the door did its old song. Outside, snow had auditioned again and landed the part, tentative and lovely, dissolving on the Eppley woman’s cheek before it could be counted during anyone’s testimony.

On New Year’s Day, the legions of walkers took to the path around the reservoir with their good intentions zipped in. Dr. M went too because there are rituals even the skeptical find themselves repeating, if only to be near other people who have decided to walk in an unthreatening circle as if that were a sentence the day could use. The lake wore its ice like someone experimenting with eyeliner: too thick here, too thin there, absolutely impossible to get even. Dogs learned again that their feet can be confused. A couple who had nearly broken and had not stood at the railing and looked down like people who had seen a ghost and had agreed not to feel that way about him again. Lynette had crept in behind the trees and put her hand on the patched chain link where teenagers had perfected the art of kissing briefly enough not to get yelled at and long enough to remember later. Her intake was triumphant and then tired and then steady. The verbs in her chest had learned to sing together better. Stay braided itself with go and made a new word in a language the town had not known it needed. Enough softened to be an arm across a bench, and help rose like a flock and settled like a coat.

That night, Dr. M did the thing she had tried so cleverly not to do all her days. She asked for company and did not apologize for the asking. She sent a text to the cousin, to Farouq, to Pilar’s mother, to Albert, to the Eppley woman of all people, to the librarian who tied her hair with a pencil, to the janitor who had let the manger keep its blue. They came like weather comes, some on time, some dramatically late, and the apartment learned what a radiator does when a room fills with humans and their heat. They sat on chairs mismatched on purpose and the floor which had been designed for books rather than bodies and ate beans and weird little cheeses and bread that felt honorable in the hand. Pilar fell asleep with her cheek on the handprint pillow and no one moved her because moving a sleeping child is a power you do not practice unless it is required. They talked about nothing and everything and if anyone used the word community it did not grow mold in the air before it landed. When the giant passed outside, which she did, because she had learned to walk by the building like a neighbor who wants to be good at it, someone said, “There she is,” and no one ran to the window because the window knew where its attention was owed.

In the small hours, when small forgivenesses receive their best chance at being said, Dr. M stood with her hand against the window glass and felt the cold be honest about what it intends. The radiator did not cough. It breathed like a person who, after eating and listening, can finally fall asleep in company. She thought of the offer with its money and its coast and its flattery and wrote on the back of an envelope, a surface that had never minded being temporary: stay. She underlined it softly; you can bruise paper if you try, and she did not. She put the envelope on the table beside the plant that had learned to be grateful for stingy light and did not check the window again to see if anyone was watching her do the right thing. She went to bed and did not dream of a boy saving the giant, and did not dream of saving anybody with a paper, and did not dream of the jail or the fair or the bandstand or the word, and woke to a town that had taken a breath and kept it, briefly, like a promise being honored in ordinary time.

By the time the students came back in January wearing coats that made them look like gentler galaxies, the blue had become winter’s favorite rumor. It would show up in the frosting on a cake in a window on a Sunday and then refuse to take the same shape twice. It would refuse noses and insist on thresholds. It would write a delicate cheek-mark over the sign of the methadone clinic where a woman in slippers showed up five minutes after her dose had turned into a pumpkin and a nurse whose patience had been exercised like a hamstring said, “Come tomorrow and I won’t put a note in your file,” and when the woman cried from the humiliating mercy, the nurse put a box of tissues on the counter and said, “Use two, they’re cheap,” and both of them laughed because people will laugh at a bad joke if it means the power dynamic got weird for three seconds. Dr. M kept adding pins to the map and had to hang a second map to the right because towns spread. On the top edge of the second map, in a corner no thumbtack could reach, a small blue crescent appeared overnight with the exact curve of a human ear. She put her ear there and could hear, faint but earnest, one verb she had not heard before, smallest of all: learn. She took her hand off the pushpin box and put it in her pocket because learning is sometimes the same position as waiting with your hands where people can see them.

They tried some rescissions. A city crew with a budget they were slightly embarrassed by brought to the jail a new solvent donated by a company that was not Eppley and had named itself after water in a way that made the water tired. The crew wore gloves for liability and sprayed and waited and scrubbed. HELD blued their rags like a baptism that does not require belief. After an hour a young man in a knit cap said, “I feel like I’m erasing a diary,” and his supervisor said, “Then stop,” and he said, “We can’t,” and the supervisor said, “We can,” and they did. They rolled the machine back into the truck with the delicacy you use for burdens you’ve decided not to carry. The sheriff, watching from a respectful distance, put his hand up to the blue that had refused to leave his skin, and touched his forehead again, a practice twice now. The maintenance woman at his office taped up a new calendar with a picture of a mountain that had never been in Illinois and wrote on February’s blank square in a sharpie that had been purchased to mark boxes: don’t forget to remember.

In a nurse’s break room at Carle, where the clock had been set five minutes fast for ten years and nobody could remember why but respected the decision, a nurse with a voice like gravel and mercy said, “We need to mark the NICU,” and everybody grimaced because hospitals like to keep control of their nouns and adjectives. The mark showed up anyway, thin as a whisper, on the doorframe so slight only people in the paradoxical habit of seeing too much saw it. It said: KEPT AGAIN, and the nurse with the gravel voice put her head in her hands for a second before a pager asked her body to leave its moral life on a chair and go do the job. In the cafeteria, a man with a visitor badge ate a jello that shook like a sentence trying to decide whether it had earned a semicolon and did not taste it, but the body accepts sugar as a temporary apology even when it is not listening.

When, in late January, the wind decided to be rude and the roads decided to be themselves, the town gathered in little circles around tables that had been embarrassed all fall by being asked to hold politics and now were allowed to hold soup. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth shoveled his driveway and realized he liked the simplicity of that more than anything else he had done in six months. The librarian took down the poem about cows because it had suffered enough and put up a poster that said, in a font that did not lie about its intentions: WINTER READING CHALLENGE: COUNT YOURSELF. A teenager with a mother who had gotten good at not asking sure you’re okay said, “I’m going to read a book without a sword in it,” like a rebellion, and did. The Eppley woman knocked on Dr. M’s door with a Tupperware of something soup-adjacent and a note that said, for real, and Dr. M wrote back with a clean spoon, the kind of friendship that people who have been unhelpfully capable all their lives must be taught like language late.

The blue put itself on a street corner where two boys had planned to fight and then had found themselves talking about their fathers instead, which is what happens when you put acts of violence on hold, tenderness insists. It drew a tidy little eyebrow over the traffic sign as if to say, look at the angle of your day. No one did graffiti over it because some agreements move faster than letters. In a classroom, a teacher wrote on the board: Consent is not a theory, and a boy who had stripped his eyebrows of everything he could control felt, briefly, an ease as if the room had warmed by one half degree. In the hallway, Pilar handed a new girl blue that would wash off her fingers but not her memory and said, “You don’t have to,” and the girl said, “I want to,” in a voice like a pen hesitating over a check.

When the first thaw came like a rumor and then left like a tease, the giant stooped under the telephone wires and touched the river for the first time since everything began. It had been there all along doing its work without applause. She put her hand flat down and the water made a sound like agreement without surrender. On the bank, Dr. M stood in a coat that had never been famous and said, “Are you tired,” as if you can ask tired a yes or no. Lynette lifted her hand and the water lifted with it, shallow and not, the way feeling does when you have done too much for someone and then watch them sleep. “Not of you,” she said, and the you meant the city and the you meant the woman and the you meant the verb. The names in her chest arranged themselves and made for a second a chord, the kind a room will teach itself if you let it. Enough leaned against learn and made a winter. Stay put its head down on help’s lap and slept. Go stood by the door and did not tap its foot and did not check its watch and waited the way a good friend waits when you are putting on your shoes for the city you were trying not to love.Chapter Ten found the town in the kind of thaw that makes people audibly remember their knees. The dirty snow slackened and pulled back from curbs like a bad idea reconsidered. The blue, which had grown used to the dry, discovered the damp the way a song remembers its bridge and came forward in the mornings with a faint halo no solvent could coax on schedule. Dr. M woke to small sounds that had been hiding under winter—the drip as character, the creak as epigraph—and felt, in the loose way you can when there is still coffee to make and students to be kind to, that something had moved a half inch toward forgiveness. She put on a sweater that had been brave all season and went to her desk and wrote in her notebook the verbs she had heard last: learn, mend, keep, and then, hesitating as if introducing a new friend to the group, risk.

It arrived on a Tuesday in the exact middle of a sentence about nineteenth-century diaries: a risk embodied as a letter on university letterhead that looked like all letters and did not, because Pilar had been named. The administration, woke up by the committee’s committee and the phone calls that bear down and the local news that had learned to pronounce chromophore, had decided that minors could not be in faculty offices during office hours unless accompanied by guardians, or unless they'd signed the right form with the right initials in the right boxes. The letter was careful not to say what it meant; it included words like liability and precedent the way people include parsley. Dr. M held it as if it might bite and then smiled with an anatomy that had to be practiced. She wrote in the margin, with less cruelty than wit: there is always a form for asking people to stop being inconveniently human. Then, because she had promised herself to practice risk, she emailed the dean and asked for a meeting and brought Pilar’s mother a loaf of bread that had cost more than it ought to and tasted like competence.

The dean’s office had a carpet that had been vacuumed brave and a window onto a view of a tree that had been planted with a ceremony neither of them had attended. The dean, a man who liked to push his glasses up his nose even when they had not slipped, explained the policy with a good faith he had inherited. He did not want a town to spill into his building and he did not want to be the one who had said no to a child and he did not like the mess of both. “We are trying to be consistent,” he said, and Dr. M, who had spent the morning grading narratives, almost said there is no such thing and did not. She said instead, “Consistency is a beautiful lie when it’s not laid over people,” and watched him grimace the way men do when a metaphor knocks politely at their doctrine. They compromised in the way people do when they can be seen; Pilar could come if Dr. M kept her door open and if Pilar’s mother signed a permission that used the word mentoring too often and never once said collecting. Outside, the tree did its inexpensive miracle of budding, despite forms.

The fairgrounds became a winter ghost and then decided suddenly to be a church again for a day. The town declared a drive for coats and then discovered it had no place to put the line of coats it had conjured, and Albert kept the back of his truck open like a trough and laughed once all day in a way that made people hand him quarters for the laundromat even though he had not asked. Blue appeared on the chain of the gate that had always caught a boy’s sleeve and made him cry and then grow a callus there he would not understand until he was a man. The word was small and precise: OPEN, written on a link as if it were a dare. A child with wrists still made for bracelets traced it and asked his mother what it meant to open a thing and not be sure what would come in. She said, “We find out,” and the blue on the gate glowed as if proud of having assigned homework to the universe.

The Eppley woman showed up at Browbeat with a haircut that suggested she had remembered her head was made for weather. People had stopped booing her even in private and started letting her tell the part of the story where she had sat in the diner and cried because jobs sometimes turn you into a noun you did not meant to be. She read a small essay with the steadiness of someone admitting hand tremors, about the day she had introduced the solvent to her own reflection for five seconds and then wiped it off her own forehead for twice that long and how she had hated herself for wanting to see if the world would be nicer to her if she complied. The room made a hush that had learned respect without applause. After, a chemist from down the block who had been quietly in love with molecules since he had blown up a lima bean in fifth grade came and said, “It matters that you also want to make people’s skin not itch,” and she looked at him like she might someday allow herself to be forgiven in public.

On the other side of town, under the overpass where pigeons wrote their own laws, a boy named Jai—with a jaw like a decision and eyebrows that had faded to a blue the shade of history—skated the same four-foot stretch of concrete until it bore a small groove only wheels know. He loved the giant the way you love an aunt you see at barbecues who tells you one sentence that saves a summer. He had a father who said the word man in different fonts and a mother who boiled tea and called it medicine because that made the day behave better. He had saved up for a new deck and then given the money to a friend who had not asked and he felt ridiculous about it with a righteousness nobody had taught him to recognize as holy. The blue found his board one evening when he had left it leaning crooked against a pillar, and when he came back in the morning his grip was a galaxy of flecks you could not sand off without turning the wood into dust. He ran his hand across it and said, “Okay,” to the wrong deity, and the pigeons shifted their commentary.

Dr. M began to catch herself using the word we in sentences where she had previously reserved the pronoun for friends and essays. “We have to assume the blue will outlast our good intentions,” she said in class, chalk dust careless on cuff and wrist, and the students nodded as if this were a civic fact like taxes. The boy with the guitar fingers wrote a poem so guileless it took her breath and then put it in her hand as if asking for permission to keep it. A girl whose eyebrows had never acquired pigment made a collage of mirrors and wrote an artist’s statement where she confessed, with mean genius, that sometimes she wanted blue just to shut people up about choice. The kids were fine half the time and half the time were the kind of heroic that requires an intermission, and Dr. M, who had worn her patience like a cardigan for decades, discovered a muscle under it that had not been used since her own ridiculous twenties.

In March, as if in apology for having been predictably cruel, the state sent money. You cannot mark a town and then not expect a grant to arrive. The money came in a bundle tied with the kind of reports that smell like the inside of a filing cabinet and it had stipulations that — like all stipulations — had learned to sit with their legs apart. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth licked his finger and turned the pages and said, in a tone that wanted to be generous, “We can fund mentorships,” and the art teacher said, “We’re already mentoring,” and the nurse said, “The NICU needs chairs,” and the sheriff said nothing at all because he had discovered that silence was sometimes cheaper than regret. They formed another committee because even attention has to justify itself to square tables; it met in the old Elks Lodge where the wallpaper had given up arguing with time. Someone had the good sense to call it a mutual aid fund and someone else had the sense to make it universal enough not to turn need into application, and a woman who had taught Sunday school for thirty years wrote on the whiteboard the only line that got applause: an emergency is when we hear each other faster.

Lynette moved decidedly through the part of town where stories go to nap: the long rectangle of self-storage where divorces and Christmas live together and do not admit it. She wrote on one door, with thrift and the steady hand of someone who has practiced not apologizing, the word SAVED, and it looked like an error until you saw the next door, which wore the word LEFT, and the next: FOR. A man stopping to pay a late fee read all three and called his sister in Decatur because there are moments you cannot carry unshared. Dr. M stood on the little break in the curb and watched this grammar be installed like a chandelier in the open air, and thought of the way a sentence rearranges a day. She put her finger on her own wrist and felt the old pulse and thought: risk.

The teenage boys with nets, now city employees with vests that permitted them to be ridiculous in sanctioned ways, pivoted to helpfulness with a professionalism that would have made their mothers proud if their mothers had been the kind to be impressed by municipal grace. They closed a street during a parade without making it worse. They lifted a too-low wire and learned how to hold their arms not like conquest but like invitation. One of them—Cooper, freckles like arguments on his nose—told Dr. M during a pause where faux-perimeter became leaning and listening that he had thought he was going to be the guy who caught her and now he was the guy who kept kids from walking backward into poles. She said, “That’s better,” without patronizing him, and he let himself be told; there are ways to be useful that do not sparkle on résumés that still feed a city.

At the library, the board approved, by an oldest-people-voice vote, the creation of a special collection labeled Ephemera of the Blue Movement, and the librarian with the pencil in her hair wrote a list that began with “photocopies of nothing” and ended with “memories people think they lost.” They collected solvent pamphlets and Browbeat flyers and an embroidery someone’s grandma had made of a blue eyebrow that looked, accidentally, like a bird. They put the pillowcase with the handprint in a glass case without putting a name on it and everyone in town knew and didn’t, and Pilar dragged three of her friends to see and whispered, “That’s hers,” with the pride we take in other people’s myth. Dr. M stood at the back with her hands in the jacket she should have retired two winters ago and allowed herself to feel ceremonial in a way that did not require a podium.

A rumor insisted on brandishing consequences. It said a legislator from the north had drafted a bill with a name that balanced badly on its shoes—Public Visual Integrity Statute—and that it would fine municipalities that failed to remove unsolicited pigment from municipal property within seventy-two hours. It listed clarifications that contradicted themselves like haste, including a clause about safety markings and a clause about religious exemptions and a clause about signage for the illiterate that made people argue in grocery aisles in front of endcaps. The hearing happened in a room with leather chairs that had been sat in by men who like to be told when they are right, and the bill hiccuped and did not pass that day because a janitor had taped her own handwritten sign to the back of the door: TAKE YOUR GARBAGE WITH YOU, and someone took a picture and it had eyebrows and millions of people liked it. The legislator went on the radio and said no one understands the costs of graffiti abatement and the radio man said you should come to our town and meet HELD and the legislator did not laugh and the radio man did because laughing had become, for him, survival.

The verbs adjusted. What had been enough in December shifted to tend in March, and a new one, quiet as a cat, crept in around the edges of Lynette’s steady drum. It said teach, in a whisper that did not carry chalk dust and did not end in a test. She started, without meaning to look like a schedule, showing up near places where new people were trying to keep breathing: citizenship classes at the Y, the diner on the night shift when first-day waitresses burned pancakes, the rooms at the shelter where rules were recited like spells and broken like bread. At the citizenship class she put a neat bar of blue above the coat hook, just where a hand reaches up without thinking; a woman from Eritrea looked at it and laughed the way her mother had, and passed the test three days later, and the blue faded but not in her wrist. At the diner she marked the coffee machine, ridiculous and perfect, and the night shift got thirty cents’ more respect on average for a week; the girls rang it up as free pie and called it rumor.

April arrived like an apology with a bouquet. The forsythia inched toward its annual shout. The sky learned to be big again without being scolding. The high school put on a spring play with limited budget and infinite willingness, and the kids painted eyebrows on the cardboard cityscape because the town had them and because they were funny and because their teacher had said yes more than was wise. The sheriff played the mayor onstage and took direction with the forlorn humility of men who are more used to giving it, and at one point his hat fell off and the blue on his fingers flicked forward and clapped before he could stop them. People laughed and then remembered to let the laughter grow into something gentler. In the wings, a boy cried without making noise and a girl handed him the sleeve of her sweater and went back on to deliver a line about taxes as if everything were under control.

Pilar had a fight with her mother that contained both of their grandmothers, as good fights do, and then showed up at Dr. M’s door with a bag of Gushers and an apology and a question. “Do you think she’ll ever stop on her own,” she asked, meaning both Lynette and her mother and not meaning herself. Dr. M sat her at the table where the plant had at last made peace with its own lackluster window and said, “People stop doing things all the time without doing worse things instead,” and Pilar said, “That is not how anyone in my family acts,” and they laughed, relieved to have named a truth that would not punish them for its accuracy. They sorted the Gushers by color as if deciding a canon. Dr. M said, “Do you want to ask her for something,” and Pilar said, “I want her to write on the door to the bathroom at school the word safe where the seniors like to say curse words about freshmen,” and the way she said safe made the air trip, and two days later, on a Tuesday that rained one street at a time, the word appeared on the underside of the stall, where a girl’s head goes when she hides. It was small and just this side of prim. It was a promise made in block letters and tile.

There were, because there always are, people who were impatient with what cannot be monetized. A developer tried to fold the blue into a marketing deck for a new cluster of condos that called itself by the name of a prairie that had been eaten to build them and featured a mock-up with tastefully blue eyebrows on the residents in the rendering. The town laughed in the exhausted way of people who have seen worse ideas pass with ribbons on. The developer took down the slide and offered to fund a youth center and everyone clapped because two things can be true and one of them can be money. The youth center painted its skate ramp blue because the boy named Jai had volunteered to teach a kid to drop in without breaking, and the kid did and did not and everyone cheered and a nurse in the audience held her breath like a prayer and then let it out when the boy stood and called his mom instead of trying to be brave without.

One evening, at the end of a day that had worn its light like a good ring, Dr. M walked the path by the river with Farouq and listened to him tell a story that seemed to be about a girl and was about everything else too. He had learned to love in public with the caution of a person who had been taught to be entertaining first, and she watched him move the furniture back in his own heart so there would be space for a guest to sit without bumping a shin. He said, “I used to think wanting to be chosen was a weakness and now I think it’s a curriculum,” and she said, “You’re late to your own party,” and he said, “At least I brought ice,” and they grinned like people trying. They stopped near the place where the giant liked to pause, just long enough to let the verbs in her chest agree on a chorus, and the wind moved their hair like a small supervision. They did not bother to look up to see if she was there; they knew the signs when their bodies stopped performing and started noticing.

The radiators in the town had adopted a new program. They behaved. They breathed, they did not cough. Even the one in Dr. M’s apartment that had staged operettas all winter learned to hum like a discreet friend. On a night when the frogs in the retention pond across from the cemetery found sudden confidence, Dr. M woke to the exact sound of her own name said kindly and then realized it had been the radiator’s particular talk and laughed in the dark at the way humans wish to be invited to their own sleep. She rolled over and put her hand on the pillowcase with the handprint and did not feel sentimental, just located. In the morning she went to the jail not because anything was scheduled but because sometimes you visit the word you admire. HELD was the same color it had been when it arrived and not; a thousand eyes had touched it and that kind of attention becomes a patina. A woman standing near it with a purse that had been patched three times put her hand on the concrete next to the word and said, to the air, to the building, to her own blood, “I can wait,” and the verbs in Lynette’s chest made a sound like recognition.

At the foster office, KEPT got a cousin. Someone, giant or not, put above the cot in the visiting room the word RETURNED in a blue so quiet you would only see it after an hour, and a child who had learned that all rooms can be modified sat under it and played with a broken truck and glanced up just once to make sure the word was still there. At the methadone clinic, the nurse with gravel added to the whiteboard in the break room a new rule that scrolled like a poem: drink water, eat something with protein, tell someone a silly story, read the word on the doorframe when you think you are the only person who has ever felt like this, make the bed because a future is coming and will need a place to sit. The staff laughed and then did it because leadership is sometimes a request at the right volume.

If there was a climax, it declined to be photogenic. It arrived on a Thursday with the ordinary cruelty of a student admitting to plagiarism and a truck breaking down on Neil Street and a grandmother losing the list she had written for her grandson and then remembering it item by item like a conjurer. A boy in a hoodie with the wrong logo went downtown with a marker he had not bought to write over HELD because a man on the internet whose face he’d never seen had dared him in a way that made him feel brave. He stood with his hand and the marker and the concrete and the word and an intention he had rehearsed since noon, and the blue did not flare and Lynette did not appear and the sheriff did not call out and no one told him he was a villain or a hero. He lifted his hand and wrote in a teenager’s hurried hand one letter and then another, and when he was done, on the other side of HELD, in black that would fade before the blue did, was the word LAUGHED. The boy stepped back and swallowed his own motive and started to cry and then stopped because crying in public is an ocean. Dr. M, who had rounded the corner holding a coffee she did not yet regret, stood with him without speaking because shutting up is the hardest part of witness. He told her his name like a dare and she told him her job and he looked disappointed and then relieved. Together they stood and let the words sit beside each other without choosing which one was supposed to win. Years later people would argue about whether LAUGHED was vandalism or a companion and the best arguments would end with cake.

May forgot to ask permission and arrived. The town shed its coats like statements it no longer had to make. The blue did not leave because seasons are not contracts and love is not obliged to obey the solstice. The bandstand hosted graduations that made people think about their hands and about forms and about lines, and a dozen boys with blue eyebrows did their best to look blasé and failed beautifully. The Eppley woman wore a dress like a successful apology and sat with the chemist and held hands out of sequence with the music because people in love do not always keep time. Albert taught a kid how to secure a tarp with rope squarely and said a sentence to the effect of if you learn to tie things you will never feel quite as lost. Pilar brought a disposable camera to the fair and took photos of things in between things, the kind that Instagram cannot metabolize, and taped one to Dr. M’s door where two hands almost touched and did not make a masterpiece and did make the day easier.

In the slow, reliable crisis of summer, when everything gets too much and people forget they get to sit, Lynette did something so ridiculous the town retained it without trying: she lay in the shallows of the river and let the kids climb her arm like a diving board. She did not let them dive. She said, in her way that bypassed ears, we do not turn love into danger just because the light is pretty, and the kids rolled their eyes because kids understand cynicism as religion and then lined up and jumped anyway into the shallow water with their knees up to their chests and their hands pinched on their noses, harmless as joy. A mother with her hair up to keep it from clinging to her neck cried behind her sunglasses in the accurate way of women finally given a rest for three minutes. Dr. M sat on the grass and wrote nothing down and ate a sandwich she had wrapped like a treasure, which is to say: she let herself be audience and not archive.

At dusk, with mosquitoes that had not learned boundaries and a sky that could not help showing off in pinks that would be despised if they were sweaters, the verbs in the giant’s chest found a new harmony. It said stay as invitation and not demand. It said go as permission and not exile. It said learn like a door ajar and not as a chore list taped to the fridge. It said enough and meant not the end but the feast. Dr. M stood because she had sat long enough and because standing is one way to tell your body you intend to keep it. She put her hand on the trunk of a tree that had not done anything particularly poetical in a decade and felt a rhythm under the bark that people who call themselves scientists forget to put on charts. It was not a miracle. It was a town that had been leaned on and had not fallen and had decided, in that inexplicable way human places do, to teach itself how to hold.

When she went home, the radiator did not sing but she did. She sang, badly and only two lines of a song she had known at eight, without thinking what music meant and without thinking about the neighbors above with their small feet and large opinions. The pillowcase lay on her bed like a map addressed to her. She wrote on an envelope, which had stand in for decisions admirably all winter, the words Chapter Ten ends badly if I try to make it useful, and then crossed out ends and wrote begins. In the morning she would make coffee and ask the kids to tell her everything she had forgotten, and they would and they would not, and she would write it down and leave some of it alone. The plant had put out a new leaf the size of a coin and did not apologize. Outside, the town rehearsed breathing, and under the telephone wires that had learned manners, a giant put her hand on the roof of the laundromat with the corkboard and the missing sock and the jar of quarters and remembered the names she carries out loud until they were not only hers to hold.
