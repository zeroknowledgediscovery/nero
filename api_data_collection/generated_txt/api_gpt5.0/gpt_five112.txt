On the evening the river ran backward, the stones of Exeter remembered my name.

It was a clammy dusk, fog lifting like old lace from the Exe, and the cathedral’s green fell silent in that way the city does when it listens for mischief. I had been walking the ridge above the quay, shirt torn at the hem and pockets full of chalk dust, following footprints the color of old candle tallow. The prints led nowhere in particular and everywhere at once; a goblin's trick, and I ought to know. My name is Grimsby Thistle, son of no one and everyone, a gutter-born goblin with a neat eye for gears and keys and trouble. I grew up two streets from the Holloway, under the lip of Rougemont's red walls, and that night I was hunting a rumour with claws.

Herne padded a step behind me, his paws as quiet as unspooled thread. He smelled of rye grass and iron, of coin and warm fur, and when he breathed everything nearby took a little step back. People have asked me why a lion would bother with a goblin like me. I’d prefer they asked it while Herne is in earshot, because his answers are better than mine and carry the weight of that unblinking gaze. He likes me. It’s true. He says I am good at finding what gets lost and at saying nothing when saying something would ruin the day.

“You’ve got your tongue in your pocket again,” Herne murmured. His voice is the scrape of rope over stone, threaded with patience.

“Thinking.” I squatted at the edge of the lane, reached out, and pinched one of the prints between forefinger and thumb. The stuff crumbled like pastry. Tallow mixed with chalk, a bit of ash, and perhaps something human pulled thin. Skerrick had always liked old church candles. Don’t ask me why. He said they taught him to be humble.

“Thinking is not catching,” Herne said. “You forget to use your feet when you think. He’ll be down by the water. Hear it?”

I listened. Noise spreads from the quay into the city like gravy on bread, slow and soaking; that night, it was wrong. The water ticked instead of rushed. The looms in the old warehouses clinked as if turned by reluctant hands. And somewhere below us, under the lip of Cricklepit Bridge, a laugh. Not a full laugh. The beginning of one, sharp and tasting of tin.

“Skerrick.” I felt my ears heat. It’s a goblin thing, how our ears flush before the rest of us catches up. “If he’s here, why leave the prints? Why bother with the candles?”

Herne stretched his jaw, showing the pale edges of his teeth. “Because he knows you’ll follow signs that don’t lead anywhere. Because he misses you. Because he wants your attention.”

“I never gave it,” I said. But that was a lie, and it hung there, slow and glossy as treacle. Skerrick and I learned to scramble up the same drainpipes, once. We’d split stolen apples down the middle with my penknife and counted the pips, and in the counting we’d made plans with the sort of bones only children break. He’d liked the dark more than I did. He liked how dark took things in its mouth and swallowed and how we kept moving anyway, while others froze.

Herne bumped my shoulder with his. “Your heartbeat is uneven. Do not chase him like a dog. He wants a chase.”

I pressed my palms to the cobbles and felt the city hum in me. Exeter is not new. It is layer upon layer of old words and older feet, and at night, if you are quiet and happen to have the sort of head that listens, it speaks. Tonight it spoke of wedges knocked into gates, of doors that wouldn’t shut, of flames licking the rags that kept the water wheels from squealing. Somebody had taken the city’s good, ordinary noises and tuned them wrong. It felt like waking up and finding your own name spelled as a stranger’s.

“Herne?” I said. “Do you ever hear me anymore?”

He looked at me in that slow way he does when I am asking a question with teeth hidden in it. “I hear you when you speak. I hear you when you do not. I hear you when you forget to breathe.”

“I don’t forget.”

“You do. We are both too proud to name it, but you slip. I feel you slip. Why don’t you ask me what you are afraid to ask?”

“I’m not afraid.” The city hummed again. Something like trampling. Many feet. Something like cheering except not happy. “Say it or swallow it.”

“You ask if you are still here,” Herne said simply. “The answer is that you are, until you choose not to be.”

I laughed, quick and raw. “That’s not an answer. That’s something a priest would say while he pats your head and pockets your last decent coin.”

“Then I suppose your city’s priests have become interesting.”

We crossed the green as the bells failed to sound. That was wrong too. There is a time every evening when the little bell at St. Martin’s catches like a fish and the Cathedral tries to match it and never can. Tonight, nothing. We went down past the guildhall, where the roof dragons caught the fog in their carved upper teeth, and into the row of old ale houses that smelled of poor decisions and wet wool. No one waved. No barkeep shouted my name. I tell myself this was normal, that I had ducked my head and kept to shadows to keep Herne from being mocked or to keep from having to buy another round I couldn’t pay for. But I wish I could say someone had looked up and smiled and said, “Grimsby, what trouble are you mending tonight?” I wish I could say they saw us at all.

“They’ll miss you if you keep walking,” Herne said, surprisingly tender.

“They haven’t missed me in years.”

“Maybe they learned your habit.”

We slipped into the lower market’s warren, through a slice of alley where the bricks swung inward as if to whisper. Some nights I cut the city into squares in my head, like a quilt, and piece by piece, I walk it, just to say hello. I have my places. The old roman wall that breathes when it rains. The gate where the rag-and-bone boy fell asleep and woke to find himself crowned with fish heads by cruel hands. The Post Office door with the split in the middle that makes it look like an elderly mouth. Tonight, the quilt felt unpicked. As if somebody had found my map and stolen the thumbtacks.

The footprints ended at the quay stairs. When I knelt, the tallow had melted and wept down the grooves worn by other men's shoulders, other women's patient baskets. The Exe at flood is not kind, but tonight it kept whispering upstream as if cousin to the wind.

“You hear it?” I said.

“Bad song,” Herne said. “Made of wanting.”

We descended. The arch under the bridge trembled with any small sound. I could see his outline before I saw him: a stop in the fog, a bite taken out of the air, a habit of standing that had stolen itself from cruel theatre. Skerrick wore a suit he hadn’t earned, threads too fine for his hips, and his hands were clean. He never liked dirt. It is why he hired others to move things when I would have moved them myself.

“Grims,” he sang, and his mouth made a bowstring shape, stretched and stretched. “You came. Look at you. Still with your cat.”

Herne snarled, low and rare. “I will not teach you the difference anymore.”

Skerrick’s eyes slid off the lion as if Herne were a trick of the reeds. It wasn’t that Skerrick couldn’t see him. He wouldn’t. Goblins choose their truths with knives. He chose not to see Herne and so he didn’t have to fear him properly. Me? He had no such mercy.

“I’m not here for you,” I said. “I’m here for the city. You’ve got your hands in its works, Skerrick, and I can smell the grease on you from the cathedral green.”

He sighed in that theatrical way that makes men give you things to shut you up. “You always loved a speech. Since when did you become their keeper? Our little stargazer? Where’s your telescope? Where’s your good coat with the patches like islands? Where’s… oh. Never mind.”

The ache slipped under my ribs like a game blade. “If you’ve come to the quay to snipe, you’ll get wet feet and a swift kick and nothing else. What did you do?”

He pretended to clean his nails. “Sometimes I think about the way the street lamps look at dawn. You know the hour. When the lamplighters are slow because their legs ache and the fog gets sulky, and some of the lamps keep burning a moment too long. The city looks like it’s made a mistake. What if the mistake were bigger? What if the lamps burned all day and the clocks all told the wrong hour and the bells forgot what they were for? Would the city still be itself, or would it turn over like a dog and ask to be told something new?”

“I have no patience. Tell me what you did.”

His language softened and his eyes did not. “I told the water it was rising. I told the wheels they were tired of turning. I told the bell ropes that hands are cruel. I told the night to curl up under the chairs feet. I told the city a story. It liked it.”

“You whispered into hinges,” I said. Salt on my tongue. “Little things. And then you watched as the little things remembered your voice.”

He laughed, high and quick. “Oh, Grims. My dear, dear coin of copper, you’re so slow. That’s all right. I always liked feeling ahead.”

Herne took a step forward. Even Skerrick had to adjust his face to fit a new thing. “You won’t do it again,” the lion said. “Not tonight.”

Skerrick’s smile went sideways. “Your pet speaks now? What is he saying, Grims? Nothing useful, surely.”

“He’s saying leave,” I said.

“Ah. But before I go,” Skerrick said, and lifted his empty hand. He turned it, fingers splayed, and then closed it slowly, as if drawing shut a curtain. The sound of the river changed. The little tick-tick of loose bits caught under the arch turned thin and human. I realised he had found the slum-orchestra, the ordinary noise of a city’s night, and bent it like wire.

“Stop that,” I said.

“Make me,” he whispered.

Herne bristled. He is an elegant creature, and has never bristled. It looked wrong on him, like a crown on a dog. “Your riddles are poor,” he said.

“Where did you get your bright idea of a voice?” Skerrick said, irritated. “He used to speak for you.”

“We all have tricks,” I said quietly. “Some of us have ringmasters. Some of us have old bones.”

“Oh yes,” Skerrick breathed. “Old bones. That is what I wanted to see. Show me, Grims. Show me that cleverness. Show me the boy who stole the master’s keys and learned to copy them with melted starch. Show me the one who would take a broken thing and coax it into a new shape. Show me—”

“I’m not your show,” I said, and stepped forward.

The city’s breath changed. We all felt it, even Skerrick, even the river. There are moments when what you are becomes visible to you, even if you don’t want to see it. I reached for his wrist and my fingers closed on cold air and the shape of him slid under my skin like smoke. He jerked back and stared.

“Again,” he whispered. “Do it again.”

“I’ve no patience for your pantomime. Stop. It.”

He tilted his head. “The first trick you ever showed me was how to pass through a yard without being seen. Do you remember? The butcher’s wife had a nose like a hawk and you said, ‘Just be boring.’ You were wrong. You were born to be interesting, Grimsby Thistle. Almost enough to be art.”

Herne’s tail swept the cobbles. “Go,” he said, and his voice collected itself in the arch and became rope and wood and stone, and it made Skerrick flinch. Just a little. Enough.

“Not tonight,” Skerrick said, bright as frost, and leaped over the slick stones into the water where the river refused to be honest. He knew where the shallow had rearranged itself. He always did. He vanished into fog.

We stalked the quay like unhappy ghosts, Herne’s whiskers lifting to test the currents. Twice, men walked past and did not shiver at the sight of a lion in their lane. Twice, I reached for a wall to steady myself and felt the wall shy. The wrongness sharpened. I remembered the last time I’d eaten and could not.

We went to the lower lock to find the gear-ladders crammed with cloth and paper and sticks and the sort of jam a child makes when told not to touch anything. We went to the warehouse near the bridge to find the ropes cut and the crates arranged in a language I cannot read. We went to the market cathedral’s shadow, to watch the buskers stare into their hats and then look away, as if the coins inside had become teeth. And all the while Skerrick’s new story slunk through the town, tripping things that had no business falling.

“Do you remember the underground passages?” I asked, as dawn picked bits of string from the dark.

“Do you want to hide?” Herne asked without accusation.

“No. Maybe.” I pushed a hand through my hair; it snagged in a burr I hadn’t noticed. “We were children, Skerrick and I. We would sneak down with candles and salt—salt to keep the bad promises from learning us—and he’d scold me for chewing the candle ends. The old waterways are honest. They don’t like being told lies. If he’s been telling stories to the city, I want to see what the city’s oldest throat says back.”

“Then we will ask,” Herne said. He leaned against me, a weight I could hold, and the world steadied around the shape of his shoulder pressed against mine. I don’t think he realised he did that for me. Or perhaps he did, and did not say.

We cut across Fore Street, down the dip where the cobbles always sweat, past the bit of wall that remembers being Roman and has never forgiven anyone for paint. The door to the passages is not a door if you are an ordinary citizen. There is no door. There is a respectable building with corridor and booklets and a guide with a voice you could spread on toast. But if you are me, there is a door where a door ought to be. It is made in the idea of a door, and it prefers me. That’s all.

“After you,” Herne said. His mane brushed the lintel and the lintel remembered to be kinder.

The air tasted of tin and old meat and wet. Our candles hung tight little circles of bees’ breath before our faces. The passages talk in drips. Drips can tell you everything if you have a lifetime and no preferences. I have learned to be impatient small. It is less noble but more practical.

“Children used to scrape their names here,” I said, running a fingernail across the stone. “We thought if we put our names in the walls they’d remember us. That we’d be harder to forget when the city forgets everyone ordinary. We learned how to write them different, too. A letter that isn’t quite the one we’re used to. Skerrick wanted to spell his name wrong so it couldn’t be owed.”

“And did it work?” Herne asked.

“No.” I didn’t say it like bitterness. It’s just that some answers are as clean as the underside of a cup.

We reached the old brick arch that becomes the city’s throat and I put my palm to it. It should have been cool, damp. It was warm instead. Not a living warmth. The warmth of a lantern left in a cupboard too long.

“Help me listen,” I told Herne.

He shut his eyes—sudden, absolute—and the world narrowed until I could taste the stone’s palate and hear the passages breathe. In the dark that isn’t truly dark, you might suddenly find yourself at the heart of a city that has known hunger and plague and the one summer the river turned sour. You might recall your first day as someone brand new. The stone was whispering Skerrick’s story, but not in his voice anymore. It had made it its own.

“No,” I said aloud, foolish as anything. “No. You don’t want that. You like being yourself. You like bells that ring on time and carts that creak the same way every morning and everyone knows which steps to avoid at the guildhall because they’ll catch your heel and throw you, like a rude friend. You like… you like being you.”

The stone shuddered minutely. I might have imagined it. Herne lowered his head as if to rub his cheek against the wall but stopped a hair’s breath short.

“It listens to you because you listen to it,” he said. “Tell it a story.”

“I don’t have one.” The truth rang in me like a fork against china.

“You do.”

“I have a collection of ugly bits. Nothing that stays put. Skerrick always wrapped his stories up neatly. Mine are rags.”

“Tell it a rag,” Herne said, soft. “It will make a quilt of them.”

So I told the city the story of my mother, who may have been a girl with bay leaves braided into her hair or may have been a cracked wooden bowl and the habit of mending. I told it about the indignity of being short enough to hide under chairs and the skill it breeds in a boy’s hands for setting people’s feet upright. I told it how, the year the fair refused to come because the rains had sobbed forever, I learned to take apart a clock that had been in a window a century and put it back together with two teeth missing and make it still keep time, if a little kinder. I told it about the day I met a lion drinking from the water in my dream and woke to find him leaving prints in the courtyard, silent as thought. I told it about Skerrick and me and the way friendship can sour like milk left near a stove, unnoticed. By the time I was done, the candles had gone stubby and Herne had sat down without letting noise happen about it.

The stone answered. It said: I remember. It said: you are a good weight, leaning. It said many things that had nothing to do with words, and yet any person with skin could understand.

“Thank you,” I told it, and left a curl of copper wire on the ledge by the arch, gently as if it were a tithe.

When we climbed into the daylight again, the bells had remembered how to ring. Not all of them. The smallest ones gave in first, tetchy and late, then the richer ones, and by the time I reached the Cathedral yard, there was noise enough to make a saint grin. But the water still ticked wrong, and across the green you could see a smear along the rooftops, as if the sky had become careless with its hands.

“Skerrick isn’t finished,” Herne said.

“Nor am I.”

I wanted a wash and a slice of bread and something warm to get into me, but the thought turned in my mouth and became nothing. We went to see Elsie at the library because books have their own gravity and when the world lists, it is best to stand where the weight is familiar.

Elsie Fairchild is a girl with hair like vinegar, honest and sharp. She keeps keys in her pocket and the shape of other people’s mistakes in her ledger. Her eyes are lake clear and she has a way of humoring me that never feels like a pinch. She had a chalk line on one sleeve and when she saw me, she made the face of someone who’s found a worm in the apple, but only a little one and probably it will make a good story later.

“Grims,” she said. “You look like you’ve met a bramble.”

“I’m not bleeding.”

“That’s new,” she said briskly, and then looked past me. Her gaze snagged. “That’s… a… rather large cat.”

“Lion,” Herne said. He dipped his head in the kind of greeting kings should emulate.

Elsie blinked exactly once. “Right. We have no rule that says he can’t come in. We also have no rule that says he can. But I suppose that puts us at an ethical advantage. What can I do for his majesty and his keeper?”

“Skerrick’s been talking to doors,” I said. “And to bells. And to water. And the city’s been listening.”

“I noticed,” she said. “Merriman fell down the stairs three times and blamed the stairs for telling him they were flat. Which, I admit, they might have. The map swallowed itself. Look.” She spread a parchment the size of my chest on the table and tugged a corner. The lines swam a little then went sullen. “I’ve had four cups of tea and one of them was mostly paper. Tell me something cheerful.”

“Skerrick is predictable,” I said.

“That isn’t cheerful so much as optimistic in the face of a brick. He sent you a poem once with only vowels. It was an O and a lie.”

“He wants to be seen,” I said, surprising myself. “He wants to be admired while he burns it all down.”

Elsie tapped the map. “We can do admiration like putting salt on porridge. But we’ll need more than that. He’s tampered with the words of the town. I suppose the cure is more words.”

“Not better ones,” Herne said.

“No,” Elsie agreed, regarding him with a sort of pleased suspicion. “Certainly not better. Truer. There’s a difference. Grims, do you remember Mrs. Rendal’s ledger?”

“Vividly. It weighed as much as a small child and was twice as stubborn.”

“She wrote things in it that came true,” Elsie said. “And then she died and nobody could open it because the lock went officious. I’ve been copying out names from it. People and their places. The city doesn’t know what to listen to anymore. Perhaps it will listen to itself if we speak it back.”

“You want to read the whole town at it?”

“If necessary. But we can begin. We can read the North Gate. We can read the street where all the cobblers argue. We can read the yards that flood and the ones that pretend they never do. We can read the piece of wall that always thinks of cherries. We can be… boring. Like you taught me last winter when my little sister cried because the moon looked wrong.”

“Being boring is a skill,” I said.

“It’s my best one,” she said proudly, and lugged a book onto the table with a grunt. The letters sat in the paper like old ladies in pews—neatly, and with opinions. Elsie cleared her throat. “The North Gate. Stubborn since the year of the snow. Arch of brick and birds. Merciful to milkmaids in a hurry. Holds the memory of feet…”

We read until our throats scratched. Outside, the bells settled into a rhythm that could hold its own weight, and the sky forgot to smear. I felt a small loosening inside me. Like a seam relaxing. Like a hand unclenching. But I also felt Skerrick watching. It is possible to be seen without eyes. In a city like ours, there are parades of eyes, dead and otherwise.

“When will he strike again?” Elsie asked, when tea had happened and gone and Herne had made the bookstock’s cat decide to live in another room.

“Tonight,” I said. “He won’t be able to help himself. He’ll want to see how fast he can make it all fall without breaking the best bits. He’ll think he is a lover.”

“He’s a vandal with a better hat,” she said tartly. “Do you have a plan?”

“Not yet.”

“So. We’ll do what you always do.”

“What’s that?”

“Walk until the plan bumps into you.”

“Very insulting,” I said, pleased.

We left Elsie to argue with her maps and went to the gardens by the castle, where the red stone remembers warmth even when it’s foolish to. The day had turned brittle and bright. Children ran with string and paper, and the kites were stubborn things that refused to fly properly, as if unwilling to leave the city’s skin. I sat on a bench that lists to the left and watched the sunlight stutter through leaf and stone.

“Do you remember your death?” Herne asked without shifting, as if he had asked, Do you remember where you put your gloves?

The word knifed under my ribs. “That’s a joke in very poor taste.”

“It is not. I am not built for jokes. Do you remember?”

“No,” I said. “Don’t play with me, Herne.”

“I would not,” he said simply, and the quiet fell between us like linen folded smooth. We sat in it. Breath, and the sound of kites making a sound like the slapping of hands. The smell of stone.

I try not to remember certain moments. The way the winter wind filleted me on the ridge. The feel of the cathedral’s shade in summer, like a blessing that doesn’t quite touch. The time Skerrick and I opened a door that ought never to have been opened and found nothing, which was worse than anything. If there was a moment I stopped being one kind of boy and began another, it crept and didn’t leave a mark.

“I remember a coat,” I said at last. “The one with the islands. I remember a nail in my heel because the cobbler’s apprentice was tired and careless. I remember thinking I wanted hot bread and being so ashamed of it, like wanting something that belongs to better mouths. And I remember… the river smelling wrong, and my hands being too clean, and you saying—” I stopped. The word snagged like fishbone. “I don’t remember what you said.”

Herne bent and licked his paw without hurry. “I said, ‘I was getting bored waiting.’”

I looked at him then. “You waited for me?”

“I was not going to go without you.”

“Go where?”

“You call it the quay. Or the green. Or the place where you put your feet when you start to begin. Names are not important. We have been walking since.”

“Have we,” I said, which was not a question and yet sounded like one.

He blinked. “You are still here, until you choose not to be.”

A child’s kite snapped free and skittered across the path. I reached out as it clipped my sleeve. It snagged, for a heartbeat the shape of me held it. Then it slid through as if I were just warm shadow and went on. The child did not cry. He laughed, and ran, and the sun took every coin of the day and polished it.

“I can still fix a lock,” I said. “I can still read a wall. I can still make this city listen to itself. I can still…” The word friend floated up and looked at me. I didn’t say it out loud. I don’t know why. Superstition. Or pride. Or something hollow.

Herne rose and shook himself. “Skerrick gossips with night. Night is lazy in one place always. The chalk-town. The old priory. He will go where words slept a long time.”

“You’re right.” I got to my feet and felt the water in me settle. “Underground again. I hope you like ducks.”

He smiled, if lions do. It’s all in the whiskers.

By the time we reached St. Nicholas Priory, the light had decided to go sideways. The priory sits like a story somebody folded and put away and sometimes remembers and takes out again to smell. The timber beams have heard words they didn’t like and didn’t pass on. Skerrick had scattered the kitchen with herbs, bundles tied and hung, as if to remind the old kitchen what it had been. That’s always his way: making the past look like a weapon and then handing it to you with a bow.

“Skerrick,” I said into the cool, note-flat and quiet.

“In the buttery,” he called. Of course.

He had made a throne out of the barrel rack. Of course. He had placed a mirror on a stool, and he sat with his head turned toward it, making faces at himself like a child denied the lead in the mummers. He had a line of chalk across one cheek, and I could see he’d been crying and making it art.

“You grew up,” he said in the mirror. “I hate that.”

“No,” I said. “I didn’t.”

Herne spread himself across the doorway, the shape of Arrived. Skerrick’s gaze skittered off him as before. I wished for once he would look. To have to see that amends is possible in the shape of teeth.

“You turned the water,” I said. “You bent the bells. You made the market forget how to count. Why?”

He sighed without meaning. “Because I could.”

He meant: Because you weren’t there to stop me. He meant: Because the door we pushed opened and nothing came out, and I hated how the nothing looked at me like I was all it would ever get.

“You always were hungry,” I said. It wasn’t a condemnation so much as naming a river. “But this?” I gestured around at his little temple to himself. “This isn’t the city’s throat. It’s your vanity.”

“It’s both,” he said, shrugging. “And isn’t that perfect?”

“Leave,” Herne said, and something in his voice struck the beams and made the dust shiver.

“No,” Skerrick said.

He lifted his hand and the room tilted. Not physically. The words in it slid. Bread became window became nail became back into bread, and for a moment I saw how the city could become a smear if enough of its little names were tugged. How it could go slack and never sit up again. Skerrick watched me watching that. His eyes were almost kind. The kind you keep for a beloved thing you’re about to throw into a well.

“Stop it,” I said.

“Make me.”

My hands closed on the mirror’s edge and I bent my head to it and asked it, in the way we ask objects that have seen a thousand faces, to remember me a little and give me back the shape that everyone else has to carry. The glass thought about it. It wrinkled. Then, with a sigh like thin ice, it found me and gave me to myself. A goblin in a shirt that had been washed until it was less shirt than habit. Hair that cannot decide which direction it prefers. Eyes that have reined in a certain kind of wanting. And behind me, clear as noon: no shadow. None at all.

Skerrick’s face in the mirror beside mine made a holy shape of pleasure. “Oh, but you are beautiful,” he whispered. “You are a marvel. A saint in reverse. Do you know? Do you?”

I put the mirror down, carefully, the way you put down a cup that still holds something you might want tomorrow. My heart did not pound. It has learned better. “I know what I need to.”

Herne stepped forward. His tail brushed my shoulder like a comment. “Skerrick,” he said, and the priory’s old words made room for his voice. “Listen: stop. I am not going to entertain you with riddles. I am going to give you a plain thing. You are making a mess where you live. You will have to live in the mess.”

Skerrick smiled thinly. “That’s never stopped anyone.”

“It stops me.”

“You are not anyone.”

We stood very still. Sometimes silence grows teeth and sometimes it turns into a soft blanket and sometimes it becomes a cliff. Here it became all three.

I do not know what shape the next part takes. Only this: I reached into the language of the room and I took the words he had loosened and tied them back, the way you might tie back the hair of a girl too young to do it herself. I am clever with knots. Nothing fancy. Reliable ones. The room sighed. A beam seemed to lift its shoulders. The mirror wavered and decided to be only glass again. Skerrick hissed like a kettle when it doesn’t like the water it’s been given.

“You cannot fasten the whole city,” he said.

“Maybe not.”

“But you’ll try,” he said, and his eyes were fond and unfond. “Of course you will.”

He threw the chalk at me and it passed through my chest as if I were air. It struck the wall and burst, and the sound pleased him like a bell.

“You see?” he said. “You see? You can’t hold me. You can’t hold anything. How delightful. How brave. How useless. It’s like praying to an empty pew.”

“Tell me what you want,” I said. It felt important suddenly that I should ask.

He made the old bowing shape. “You.”

That had been true once. The sort of truth that sits in a boy’s pocket and wears a hole there.

“I can’t give you that,” I said. “You must have known, even then.”

He did. That was the trouble. Knowing and wanting are poor friends and worse when they sleep in the same bed.

“I’m going to undo you,” he said, at last, tired in the way certain men get tired when they’ve had too much theatre. “I’m going to pull so many small things that you won’t have hands to tie the knots you love.”

“Try,” I said.

He showed me his teeth. “I have been.”

When he was gone, when the priory went back to smelling like old wood and spices and water in stone, I sat on the cool floor and let my head fall into my hands. Herne breathed over me. It wasn’t comfort. He does not do comfort. It was company, which is more honest.

“You will not sleep,” he observed.

“No,” I said. “I don’t sleep.”

“Shall I list what you will do instead?”

“No,” I said. “Just… be. Here.”

He was. The city outside kept moving its tongue around where Skerrick had put a cut in it, worrying the wound, trying to make new words that didn’t hurt. Somewhere, a bell rang wrong then corrected itself, embarrassed.

“Tomorrow,” I said.

“It is already tomorrow,” Herne said.

“Then the day after.”

“In the day after,” he said, and for the first time in a long time his voice bent at the edge as if a sadness had pulled one thread, “in the day after you will still be here. Good. And I will be here. Better. And you will make your knots. Best.”

“And Skerrick?”

“He will be hungry.”

We left by the priory’s side door, the one that has learned to accept lions. The air on the street held the smell of bread that had been made some time ago. I couldn’t taste it. I never can. But I remembered the shape of it, and for tonight, that was nearly enough. The city shifted its weight on its old bones, and for a moment, under the wrongness, you could feel the rightness, sturdy and plain. I tucked my hands in my pockets, felt the old copper wire and the bits of chalk and the key I challenge myself not to admit I still carry, the one that opens nothing, and we walked into the evening that had been waiting for us all along.The evening peeled itself off the day like a wet label, and we let it stick to us. I try not to romanticize that hour, because that way lies poor decisions and church steps and the sort of singing you regret when the constable remembers your father’s name, but Exeter is beautiful when it’s tired and pretending not to be. The octagon of the Cathedral lantern took the last light and worried it with clean fingers. The lamplighters moved like old birds along their ladders, and the lamps came on with a series of reluctant sighs that you could count if you stood still and had a bit of arithmetic to spare in your head. Tonight the lamps did not behave. They woke early, flared, then sulked, and two refused to light at all and one took fire like a boy in a hurry and had to be smothered with a coat. Skerrick had been whispering to them. You could smell it in the soot.

A boy ran by with a note clamped between his teeth. He was trying for speed and importance and lost both when he saw Herne, skidded, and remembered he had a mother who told him about lions and what lions did to boys who forgot to carry messages. The note was for me. It had a library smell because Elsie had likely leaned on it to make it curl properly, and there was a faint ring from a cup at the top corner because she is not always careful with her cups.

“Ringers,” it read in Elsie’s careful tide of an ink. “Come if you can. The tenor sees itself as a window and the treble can’t be coaxed. Bring your cat. Bring your voice. Bring wire.”

I do not like being told to bring wire because it makes me feel predictable; I always carry wire. It lives in my pockets like punctuation. Nevertheless, the note stiffened my back as if somebody had buttoned me into good posture.

“Bells,” Herne said, looking toward the cathedral with the sort of look men save for bakeries.

“Skerrick’s been playing with them,” I said. “He knows what bells can do. You can shift a city with bells. You can call the sober home and send the wanting out anyway. You can drown a rumor or make it grow legs.”

“Then we’ll ask them to be heavy,” he said.

We took the green the way I always do, by the diagonal I do not own but pretend to when I need to feel taller. The cathedral’s doors yawned like a polite animal that doesn’t like you but recognizes your shoes. Inside, the smell of rope and dust and lead made its own weather. Elsie met us under the west window with her headscarf tied tight and chalk along one knuckle like a priest’s ash.

“You look busy,” I said, because some compliments are more useful if they don’t sound like compliments.

“I tried to be,” she said grimly. “But the sally won’t come down. It thinks it’s a curtain and keeps going sideways. Mr. Clegg said a thing about demons and then remembered he doesn’t believe in them and so had to sit down. If I pat him again he’ll confess something he didn’t do, just to please me.”

Her eyes slid to Herne and did their blink. She is chewing the habit out of that blink slowly; it will take her all spring. “Your cat will not fit up the stairs to the ringing chamber,” she added, as if this were a personal failing.

“He will if the stairs remember that he belongs,” I said, and Herne showed his teeth in the manner a saint shows a relic before he puts it away.

We went up. The staircase twisted like a kind older cousin’s ear and complained in relays. Ropes drooped through the ringing floor in their clipped scarlet and white like flowers that had forgotten the direction of sun. Mr. Clegg stood with his hands around the treble’s sally and his head was making the shape of a melon going soft. He is a man who keeps his hair in a circle out of habit, not out of vanity, and adds a tuft to it when he feels something complicated.

“Grimsby,” he said weakly. “I’m of a mind to put my head in a bucket. Mrs. Prowse says that will not help.”

“Mrs. Prowse is usually right,” I said. She was in the corner, knitting a thing that would be a comfort to ankles later in the year. Mrs. Prowse runs the bells without permission. She is the sort of woman you’d trust to make a garden in a broom closet. When she is displeased, bread will not rise within thirty feet of her elbows.

“They’ve all gone sideways,” she said shortly. “Listen.”

I did. Bells have temper. You can hear it if you let your own fall asleep a moment and don’t mind feeling foolish. The tenor hummed like a curious window, exactly as Elsie had said, and the treble fidgeted in the rope like a child at a wedding. The third and fourth were making a private joke and trying not to be heard doing it. The fifth was offended on principle. Everything in the room had developed an opinion about something it didn’t own. Skerrick had gotten in under their daily and told them they were something else. Bells are vain. You can do that to them if you have the tongue for it.

“Hooks first,” I said, and Elsie gave me a look that meant she would argue later for the joy of it. I put my fingers to the stay pins and asked them to consider me ordinary. They do not like to be noticed. They prefer to be themselves until they break and then to be mended without fuss and the right swear. Tonight they let my skin sit on them as if I were someone who could be trusted to put the pieces back. Tiny favors are currency. I pay for everything this way now.

“Skerrick told them the city was already falling,” Elsie murmured at my shoulder as she tucked her hair under her scarf more tightly. “He told Mr. Clegg he’d heard the treble telling it that it was a bridge. Mr. Clegg cried. Not for long. But enough that Mrs. Prowse has a piece of his dignity in her pocket.”

Mr. Clegg cleared his throat and pretended he hadn’t. “If the tenor is a window,” he said, “then maybe we ought to look through it.”

“Very poetical,” Mrs. Prowse said. “Hush your poetic. It makes people go cross-eyed.”

Herne stood in the doorway in the shape of something that has nothing to do with bells and everything to do with endings. He put his head on his paws with the slow satisfaction of a lord who has found a licking of sun where none was invited. The ropes weren’t sure what to do about him. They wanted to climb him. They wanted to mistake him for a pillar. He ignored them with the discipline of a man in a room with an inevitable argument who has decided to be deaf until the last possible moment.

“Names,” I said.

Elsie had her ledger. Of course she did. She flipped to the page that had the bell scheme copied out in Mrs. Prowse’s tight, crisp hand. Plain Hunt. Grandsire. Stedman. Bob Minor. Oxford Treble, written as if the word Oxford could be improved by listing it and yet was tolerated because the bells like it. The names sat in the paper like nails in a beam and had that trustworthy look nails sometimes get when they are only a little bent and you know just how much to smack them to make them behave.

“We do not better the story,” Herne said, and his mouth did not move much to say it. “We don’t preach. We don’t lecture. We say the truth that the bells already believe.”

“Plain bob,” Mrs. Prowse said in a voice that had been used to tell children to stop putting raisins up their noses. “We’ll give them plain bob until they beg.”

We began. Elsie took the treble because she could keep a tune in a pocket made of tissue if she needed to, and Mr. Clegg found the fifth because it needed a man with contrition. Mrs. Prowse kept the tenor and glared it into remembering its own weight. I took the second because I am a small man with a neat hand for not making a nuisance of myself right up until I make one on purpose, and the second likes hands that can apologize without anyone hearing. The rope was rough in my palm. It was real as a bruise. With every pull I felt myself look more like a person I remembered being, and then less, and then more. I do not pretend to understand it. A good bell wakes ghosts and then puts them to bed.

We called the changes like prayers we had no business making and had made all our lives anyway. The room stopped sliding. The ropes lost their opinions and submitted to their nature with relief. We climbed up into the sound, and through the ringing floor you could feel the city put down a foot and test the stair and find it where it had always been.

Skerrick waited until the moment when the tenor’s hum found itself again and decided to be proud. He is a man with an instinct for where to put his thumb when he wants a thing to hurt. The rope in my hand jerked. The sally snaked. A bell that had been the fifth became the third mid-swing and thought it clever. For a heartbeat I was ten years old and more stubborn than common sense and convinced that if I shouted the word stop loudly enough the world would be decent. I did not shout. I spoke the fifth’s history in the smallest voice I had and told it about hands that had pulled it during a fever and hands that had pulled it when a boy named Daniel brought a dog to church wrapped in a shawl and the vicar pretended not to see. I told it how it had rung for the last king and for the first war of my remembering and for a wedding where the bride was wearing somebody else’s dress and did not mind. The fifth stopped experimenting. It allowed me to be boring.

“Good,” Herne said, the word long as a line of bread. “Again.”

Skerrick’s laugh came up the tower like a string left on the wind. He wasn’t in the room. Of course he wasn’t. He does his best work where he can watch without the risk of being touched. The stairs shivered as if a tall man with no enthusiasm had trod them. The clock admitted to having forgotten the hour and was ashamed. Mr. Clegg’s hands slipped. Mrs. Prowse is quicker than she looks. She steadied him, did not let him pretend she hadn’t, and the tenor decided to be a bell and not a window and you could feel the whole tower breathe.

We rang a course through the wrongness. We dragged sound like a rope and tied it to the city and tied the city to itself. It is hard work being an ordinary miracle in a place that has lately been encouraged to be extraordinary in ways that bruise. By the end my arms shook and my throat was a strip of leather left in the rain too long. I could see every nail in the wood and what story it wanted to tell about being put where it was put. The last peal went like a bless-you that is half curse and not aimed at anyone and we let the ropes rise and stay in their nooses and sway themselves to sleep.

“Tea,” Mrs. Prowse said, which is what she says at every mortal crisis. “And no one tell Mr. Clegg the sermon he thought of just now. He’ll only make it worse by saying it aloud.”

Elsie put the ledger down and pressed the heel of her hand into her sternum like she was trying to iron a crease out of herself. “He’s outside,” she said. “On the green. He’s making faces at the lawn because the lawn refuses to be impressed.”

We went to the parapet and looked down. Skerrick was precise even at a distance. His suit was a new one, still too fine for him, and the chalk on his cheek had been wiped away and then put back on purpose so that it could say something other than carelessness. He paced in front of the cathedral door like a boy dared to knock on a house he doesn’t understand and wants to be punished by. People moved around him. Children stared and then remembered their mothers’ hands. A man with a hat argued with a vendor over pears.

“Tell him to go away,” Mrs. Prowse said. “Use your words. I’m tired.”

“That will please him,” Herne said. “He writes his own orders.”

“I know,” she said. “But I’m no kind of Christian. I like seeing trouble embarrassed.”

Skerrick turned his face up into the place where I might have been if I had leaned farther and could have let that sort of risk feel nice. “Grims,” he called, not loud, but with the kind of voice that hops fences without being invited. “Grims, come down. You’ve made a neat noise. Come and let me tell you what it reminds me of.”

“Of course it’s a trap,” Elsie murmured. “But then so am I when I put biscuits in a tin and leave the lid askew. It is only polite to spring the right kind of trap.”

“I’ll go,” I said.

Herne’s shoulder touched my sleeve and made a small, anchoring remark against my skin. “You will not run,” he said. “I will walk with you. We will take the long stair.”

“Skerrick likes it when we hurry,” I said.

“He likes many things,” Herne answered. “He can find one fewer to like.”

I did not expect the door to the nave to remember me. It had other things on its mind and many hands and keys and priests and the habit of creaking in a very dignified way. It admitted us anyway. The green made a sound like a great beast rearranging its blankets. Skerrick was nearing one of the dragons that carry the gutters on their backs, and I swear I saw the dragon’s carved eye narrow in the fog as if it considered biting his shoulder. It kept its manners. There is too much politeness in this town.

“Grims,” he said again, and when I reached him he hopped backward, the way you do when you want to be sure you are out of range and that the person you have invited to hit you will have to commit to it in front of witnesses. “There you are. This is getting interesting. I thought you might bore me into submission. The bells almost did. Bless them. Bless you. How pious. How small.”

“Hello,” I said, because I cannot stop myself from behaving, even when I am bad at it.

“We’re doing hellos now,” he said. “You’re sure? I thought we did those three lives ago and then gave them up as a waste of air.”

He had a coin tucked at the corner of his mouth, which he turned with his tongue and then spat into his palm and folded back into a pocket without looking. It was an old coin, thin as a poor man, and where the king’s face should have been there was a smear that might have been a thumb or a decision.

“You don’t need to do that,” I said, because if I am going to lie awake later it might as well be over something.

“What, spit up money?” His smile had that knifed slit to it that made you feel you could step through and find a room where nothing you want is set out anymore. “I am nothing if not a metaphor. Do keep up.”

“You can stop,” I said, not unkindly. “You can put your clever down and go and eat something that isn’t your friends.”

He looked at Herne then. He didn’t see him. He adjusted the angle of his chin as if to insist on it. “Grims,” he said again, and the word came out like a sip of something he didn’t want to admit to.

“Tell me what you think you are doing,” I said. “Not the coin version. The whole. Not a speech. A sentence with modesty.”

“Modesty,” he said, delighted and disgusted. “I am not using that word. It is not mine. Fine, then. I am making the city flinch at itself. I am seeing what leaks out in the flinch. I am finding a way to put my thumb on the part of the machine that keeps it kind and I am seeing if it will keep being kind even when I am cruel to it.”

“It will,” I said. “If I have to sit under every step and prop it with my shoulder until it remembers, it will. You don’t live anywhere else. Where will you sleep when you have bragged to ruin that no one wants to mend?”

“In your pocket,” he said, and the curve to his mouth was too fond for comfort. “On your shoulder. Under your chair.”

“Try it,” Herne said, and the air picked the word up and made it three thicker words, none of them friendly.

Skerrick’s face flickered like a foolish candle somebody carried too quickly down a hall. He has discipline. He straightened it. He touched his cheek where the chalk lived as if to soothe it. “Not a cat,” he said. “Never that. You can call him a lion until your teeth fall out for all I care. He is an interruption I’ve decided to honor by ignoring.”

“You always were good at not seeing,” I said, because sometimes cruelty can be used to keep a man alive and sometimes it is only the reflex of a creature that has had too many small bites.

“I saw you,” he said. “Better than anyone. I still do, when you do not perform for me like a good luck trick. And now look at you. Look at you, Grims. Do you open doors still? Do they open for you? Do you eat bread and decide to forgive yourself for liking the butter? Do you sleep?”

“It isn’t your business,” I said, and I made it sound like a joke and he made it sound like a prayer.

He took a step forward because he had to. The priest at St. Martin’s paused with his keys and then lied to himself about what he was doing and went inside with great vigor. A girl with a basket of eels forgot to decide to be scandalized. Somewhere behind us, the bells grumbled but in a satisfied, elderly way like joints getting themselves arranged.

“Tonight,” Skerrick said, and the word was a spice you cannot afford much of unless you plan badly. “Tonight I think the water will remember that it knows how to go upstairs. It will try the steps and find them sure, and then it will laugh, Grims. Have you ever seen water laugh? It is sarcastic. It has a mean, beautiful mouth. I will take it to the old passages and I will teach it your name and it will run along them and make your letters shiny. Everyone likes a shiny name.”

“You are a bastard child in a churchyard,” Mrs. Prowse said from the top of the steps, without raising her voice. “Go and wash your hands.”

Skerrick’s eyes went up. He made a graceful shape with his shoulders because he enjoys playing to the gods he doesn’t believe in. “Mrs. Prowse,” he said. “There you are. Will you knit me a noose? I prefer a nice wool. It won’t chafe.”

“I will knit you a sleeve,” she said, already turning away. “You can put your clever in it until it stops dripping.”

He laughed exactly once. It wasn’t the laugh I heard under the bridge. It was the one he keeps for eating something he likes more than he respects. He turned the way men turn when they have decided on their next cruelty and are pleased to be moving toward it, and he vanished without theatrics, which was unnerving. He simply wasn’t there in a way that had nothing to do with sight. He let the city deny him in its mouth and go on chewing.

“We need to pay the water,” I said. “It is owed. He’s been making promises in its name and not taking care of the debt. It will listen to us if we make a better offer.”

“What can we offer water,” Elsie said, hooking my elbow and steering me toward a shady bit of wall because she will not have me fall over in front of my enemies if she can spare me that embarrassment. “Besides containers and flattery.”

“Weight,” Herne said. “Boredom. Boundaries that fit.”

“Ropes,” I said. “Sluices. Names. Songs that go one-two instead of one-two-three when it thinks it wants to dance. We’ll go to Countess Wear. We’ll go to the old locks. We’ll tell the gates that hands are not always cruel. Some are ours.”

“We’ll need the old keeper,” Elsie said. “What was his name? He fed cats with sardines and told you never to climb the chain because it liked to kill fat boys and you were thin but it didn’t like young ones anyway, too gristly.”

“Mr. Yeale,” I said. “He died.”

“Then who holds his keys?” she asked.

“I do,” I said, surprising myself so much that I had to put a hand out and touch the green as if it might give my fingers salt. The key I carry is a promise that opens nothing and everything. I could feel the shape of Mr. Yeale’s key in it suddenly, the way copper remembers other coppers and longs to be near them. “I do, if I can convince the lock to remember it likes me.”

“Good,” Herne said. “The river is hungry for a story that isn’t Skerrick’s. It will eat what you give it and then nap with a full belly.”

I would like to say the walk to Countess Wear was the sort of walk that puts meat back on a man’s bones. It wasn’t. The city fussed the whole way, tugging at hems and rearranging buttonholes and telling lamplight it was a better color yesterday, and I kept wanting to put my hand on all of it and say hush now, one thing at a time. I don’t have a mouth big enough to shush a city. I have a lion and a library and a pair of hands and a habit. Sometimes that is enough. We took the path along the river, where the banks lean in like gossips and make it their business to hear each other. Skerrick had scattered bits of tallow again, and this time he’d mixed them with salt. He wanted a laugh. The river dislikes: being made to look foolish. It snapped at his game and swallowed it, and if you did not know how it eats you might have thought it had forgiven him. It hadn’t. It was counting.

Countess Wear sulks. It’s its nature. Men with more pride than sense built it and the river remembered their names and decided to barter with them forever. I have always liked it. The gates are practical and sulky and do not flirt. They want to be left to push and pull the world in the one way they know how.

“Here,” Elsie said, because she sees people like a fox sees holes in hedges. “This man is now Mr. Yeale. I accept no arguments.”

The keeper was a woman, which is a sort of joke that the world likes to make when we aren’t looking. She had Mr. Yeale’s ears and his habit of making sentences out of creaks and tobacco, but she had a mouth that had learned to give orders and expect to be obeyed, and her boots were built on the back of the word No. I regarded her with gratitude. My own mouth does not do that well.

“Grims,” she said, saving me from having to explain myself, and then, “Herne. Nice of you,” as if a lion is something that comes on Thursdays and sits where you put him. She did not ask him to trickle out of her understanding. He bowed slightly to her and looked pleased. People like that are rare enough that I keep a careful count.

“Mr. Yeale owed me a key,” I said. “I think it might be this, but it will pretend to be something else because it’s in a mood.”

“It is always in a mood,” she said. “I am Mrs. Yeale by the way, but not his. Mr. Yeale married water. He fed the cats and he loved the river and occasionally he remembered to wear a hat. The hat preferred him.”

She took my bit of key and weighed it, and the look she gave it made the lock sit up straighter under the gate like a dog that has been too spoiled for too long and is surprised to find it likes discipline. “All right then,” she said. “We will be plain. We will not make speeches. We will not tell the river it was a better river yesterday. We will tell it it is itself and nothing else is required.”

“It wants a promise,” I said. “A small one. One that will bore it into a good behavior.”

“We will promise it that we will look at it every day and not lie about it when it is ugly,” she said. “We will promise it a poem only if it asks nicely. We will promise it we won’t drown any children who have names we know. We will promise it we will try to know their names.”

Herne blinked in the way he has when he is delighted. It is like a shadow that considers its angle and decides to be generous. “She is right,” he said. “Give her what she asks.”

We went down to the gate. The metal smelled of old coin and old bread and the sort of sweat that doesn’t leave the body, even when the man who made it has gone. I spoke to it like a dog with a bad habit. I told it about Mrs. Yeale’s boots. I told it about Mr. Yeale’s hat and how hats often have more memory than is dignified. I told it about Skerrick’s salt games and how water would make him think he was winning if it could, because water loves a man in a suit; they rust so nicely. I asked it to take my key not because I deserved it but because it would be funny not to. Locks like a joke when they can tell it back to other locks later.

It took the key. It did not do so graciously. It made me work. I let it. Arms and words and the sort of patience that disappears as soon as you notice you have any were spent. The gate gave a shudder like a thing finding its own shoulder again and the rush changed. The river decided against going upstairs. It did not remember laughing. It remembered the taste of herons. It remembered boys who fished where they ought not and ran and slipped and were caught by hands and cuffed and sent home and never learned. It remembered Mr. Yeale’s tobacco and Herne’s fur and Elsie’s ink on the cuffs of her dress. It remembered me.

“Good,” Mrs. Yeale said. “Now do it again when I sneeze and when my sister sends her idiot husband to help me and when the bishop visits and thinks clothes keep him dry. In other words, do it every day, in smaller ways, until you feel foolish.”

Foolishness is my favorite part of my work. It keeps me from getting ideas about being important. We did it again in the ways a person does that cannot be described properly because they sound like nothing. We stood. We spoke. We let our weight be a kind weight. We offered wire like cake to a child that does not know cake and is suspicious of kindness. Eventually the river was bored out of its pugilism and went back to being heavy and going where weight tells it. It will forget tomorrow. That is fine. I remember enough for both of us.

Skerrick left his calling cards all up the bank from the lock to Topsham. Little things that made themselves look like nothings and then became something else if you looked past them and refused to laugh. A dock rope frayed in a pattern that spelled a rude word if you squinted your morals. A boat tied with a knot pretending very hard to be a better knot. A boy’s whistle bent into a question. I picked up what I could and tucked it away. At the quay a fishwife told me I had a pleasant face. This is a lie people tell when they don’t know if you’re going to take their vegetables. I didn’t argue. I left two bits of wire on a bollard and felt the bollard sit down in a way it hadn’t in hours.

By dark the lamps figured out how to behave for at least a few corners. The ones on the High wore their light like crowns. The ones by the iron bridge drooled a little and needed their noses wiped. The little bell at St. Martin’s remembered itself and clambered onto the hour as if climbing into a lap it pretends not to like. I hurt in every part of me that knows what a weight is and remembers the privilege of carrying it. I did not say it aloud. It would sound like complaining, and my grandmother—who may have been a bowl and may have been a girl—would have smacked my hand.

“I have a bed,” Elsie announced, as if she had invented the idea. “It is a brave bed. It has held me up every night for a decade and a bit and only once threatened to tell me a story I didn’t want. You’ll come and not sleep in the chair by the fire. I’ll make you pretend to forget how to do that.”

“I cannot,” I said. “You know that.”

“You can fail at it,” she said. “Failing is a skill you are developing nicely in some areas.”

I wanted to say yes because saying no to Elsie is like kicking a cat that has come to sit on you after a long day and insists you are warmer than the world. Herne made a small sound, the kind he sometimes makes when a thing will be both bad and good and we have to do it anyway. I shook my head and let the night move across my eyes and stood for a moment in the place where sleep would be if I could still break with myself that way.

“There will be a letter on your chair in the morning,” Herne said, without drama. “It will have no address. You will read it and not read it and both will be true.”

“Skerrick?” I asked.

He blinked. “He is not the only one who writes in this city.”

There are rooms I keep in my head that I do not share because if I do I will have to redecorate them with other people’s opinions. The little one with the map of the city done in pinholes that let whatever light there is fall out onto my hands and remind me that knowing a place is not the same as keeping it. The one with the bench by the river that doesn’t exist anymore and I sit on it anyway because refusing is a talent. The one with a coat with islands on it that has learned how to be a boat in bad weather. I went to one of those rooms while my feet carried me through the real streets and Herne moved beside me like a conviction and the city, for an hour, decided not to either fall or rise.

The letter was on the chair by the time the chair remembered me. Elsie’s hand was not on it and neither was Skerrick’s. The paper smelled of bees and something that had been buried and then thought better of it. I am not given to superstition unless it is practical. I did not touch the letter until Herne settled with his back to the door and his tail curled over his paws like a comment a gentleman suppresses.

“Read it,” he said, and I felt silly about having made him say it.

It said: My dear Mr. Thistle. I am sorry for the hour. It will be the wrong one no matter what. I have a complaint not with you but with a situation. I believe you know of whom I speak. Come to the Holloway in an hour that feels like half of another. I will wait and be cross and try to be polite and succeed. I will bring a lantern that refuses to burn out. I will explain nothing until we are under the hedge where good things go to learn humility. Yours sincerely, M. Harford, Vicar of St. David’s and occasional nuisance.

“I don’t want a priest,” I said.

“You want a man with a lantern that refuses to burn out,” Herne answered. “And you want the Holloway. You want a place that has been scraped into the earth by feet that believed something about where they were going.”

“I don’t want to be told that my condition is flattering to God,” I said. “I will put a knot in his cassock.”

“You will,” Herne said, and looked at me as if I’d already done it.

The Holloway is two streets from where I learned not to say please unless I meant it. It is a path that has been used so well that it has gone down into itself, and we do not call it a tunnel because we are sentimental and we like to pretend we are not. The hedges lean in as if about to give advice. In winter it is a frozen mouth. In summer it tastes of dog and honey and boys who will lie and get caught and lie better next time. The lantern was waiting. It did not so much burn as remember and then demonstrate.

M. Harford was a man who had failed to be tall and made up for it by being patient, which is not the same thing as kind. He had a hat that had forgotten its original shape and a tongue that had learned to make phrases like “with respect” and mean them when the person listening deserved none. He had seen Herne before and had not made a story of it because he had too many to keep track of already.

“You are late,” he said. “I forgive you. I do not forgive him. I have forgiven him and taken it back. Repeat until you want to leave this town.”

“Good evening,” I said, not unpleasantly. “Your lantern is proud.”

“It has a right,” he said. “It did something difficult and survived. It is a metaphor. I prefer not to overuse it. I have a congregation that hauls metaphors home like furniture and then finds worms in the legs and wonders who to blame. I have come to ask a thing you do not owe me.”

“Ask then,” I said, because resisting men like him is a luxury and I try not to waste them on the wrong people.

“There is a grave that has decided not to hold.” He did not look at me to see if I would flinch. He looked at the hedge as if rooting for its side. “It keeps letting go of a name. Names should not be so loose. They ought to be like belts in a wind. Firm, but not cutting. This one falls. Skerrick goes to talk at it. He sits on it and apologizes for not being the right weight, and the grave pretends to laugh. I would have it be quiet.”

“Who?” I asked, because I am a glutton for small cruelties. “Whose grave.”

“You,” he said. “You fool. Yours. Or the place that let you out. Or the idea of you that unbuttoned its collar and thought it might like air again. I will take you to see it if you like. I will not say anything unhelpful while we are there. I will only say the prayers that work as spelling lessons.”

Herne did not move. The lantern did, a fraction, and played at making a shadow for me where there is none. I wanted to be angry because it’s easier than the other thing. I wanted to be brave and made-of-wires and say something elegant. What came out was not elegant. It was a string pulled by a child.

“I do not want him to sit on me,” I said, voice thin and plain. “I do not want him to tell my name to the dirt and have the dirt prefer his pronunciation. I do not want him to have any version of me that I don’t choose.”

“Then you see the situation,” M. Harford said, and somehow he did not make it a sermon, and I did not punch him in the hat and feel sorry afterward.

We went to my grave. That is an awful sentence and if I had the energy I would put a joke on it and call it a coat and wear it until it softened. We went past the bit of wall that is always dissatisfied and through the churchyard that knows every sort of humility except the kind you can survive and up to a flat bit of ground that has learned to pretend it is not a person’s neighbor. The stone had my name carved in it and it had the other parts beside it that liked to make themselves important—dates, and a time, and a word the carver’s hand liked—and all of that was as it should be, except the letters had developed a habit of sliding like bad slate. The T in Thistle wouldn’t stay put. The M in my middle name, which I will not write here because I haven’t decided yet if you ought to have it, kept yawning.

Skerrick had placed a ribbon on it. He’d tied it with a knot like a kiss you do on the mouth when you want the other person to remember who owned whose tongue a minute ago. It had left a mark in the stone where eyes that do not belong to stone might mistake it for a blush. I put my hand flat to my own name because I am foolish and wanted to see if my skin would feel like it was touching me. It felt like warm brick. It felt like bread you cannot taste wrapped in a cloth you do not own and promising not to stain your shirt. It felt like a thing that is itself and had to be explained to me by a man with a lantern in his hand.

“We will read you,” M. Harford said simply. “We will spell you until the cutting remembers.”

Herne settled at the foot of the grave and looked as old as the things that never make anyone’s story because they took on no pretty shape. “Grimsby Thistle,” he said, and made it a meal worth sharing. “Son of no one and everyone. Goblin enough to find a lion thirsty. A boy who could make a clock keep time missing teeth. A man who thinks the river’s wrong and the river agrees because he says please right.”

“Stop,” I said, because pride is a disease and I had a mild case just then. “It will make me ridiculous.”

“You already are,” he said. “That is the only kind of saint I endorse.”

M. Harford read me like scripture and not like myth. Elsie had taught him, I realized with a stupid jolt, to keep to the plain words and let them do their work. He put his voice into the grooves and the grooves pretended to be bored for a while and then gave in and admitted that names have gravity. The ribbon did not untie. It went sour. It let the knot go slack as if tired of its own joke.

I left a curling of wire on the stone. I did it without looking at Herne so he would not have to make a joke about oblations. The wind came up and combed the grass exactly once. It was like a cat that never lets you see its affection and then makes the mistake of purring and is ashamed.

“Skerrick will come here again,” M. Harford said, more a weather report than a prophecy.

“I know,” I said. “And I will, and my name will, and if we need to we will put the letters in our mouths and hold them there until people get bored watching and go home. We are good at being dull.”

“You are,” he agreed, and took his hat off his head and let it think a while in the lantern light and then put it back and did not pray out loud because he is that rarest of clergymen, one who knows silence is sometimes the heavier thing to lift.

We walked away from my stone and did not look back because I have never found anything in back-looking that would pay for the time it costs. Herne paced with me on my left and made the world measure itself again with his shoulder. The lantern light played an old trick and made a shadow for me for two steps. I did not thank it aloud. There is gratitude and then there is bribery.

“Tomorrow he will turn to something small,” Herne said. “He has failed to embarrass the big parts. He will go to the Post Office door and teach it to bite. He will go to the stairs at the guildhall and make them move under a fat man. He will take the cherries out of the wall and make them think of vinegar.”

“We will be everywhere he is and then where he is not,” I said, only a little theatrical. “We will put stones back in their shoes and tell them to walk like they always have. We will be the worst kind of heroic—domestic.”

“You will tie knots,” Herne said, and his tail touched my knee. “I will say stop. Elsie will read. The city will try to decide to keep itself and will be tempted otherwise. Skerrick will be hungry. This is today. Tomorrow can try to be different. It will fail. Let it try anyway.”

We passed the old roman wall and it pretended not to listen. I left it a wire anyway because spite is not a useful companion for long and also because leaving wire is the only prayer I like. The street had learned how to behave for a few hours, which is all we ever ask of it. I had a chair and a letter and a lion and a grave that now had fewer bad ideas. I did not sleep. I sat and listened to the small noises inside the house be themselves, and sometimes I forgot to breathe and Herne reminded me without saying so, and when the birds negotiated the morning like men haggling over cloth, I was still there. That is not as small an accomplishment as it sounds.Morning in Exeter can be coaxed into decency if you go at it sideways. It likes to pretend it isn’t interested in you and then catch you in the act of being considerate and reward you with a cat crossing your path that doesn’t swear at you and a cart that sighs instead of shrieks. I let the light discover me in the chair so it could feel victorious. Herne had not slept either; he does not sleep so much as he allows the world to do without him for a single blink and then returns before anyone can accuse him of indulgence. He stretched when the birds forgot their first and second arguments and settled on their third, and his mane sent dust into a saintly beam that made a joke of holiness. The letter folded itself back into the shape it had been written in and sat with manners on my knee. When I stood, my bones reminded me that they consider weight a compliment. There are worse ways to be reminded that you are still here.

Elsie arrived as she always does, with a decision already made and a pocket full of things that ought to live on shelves. She did not knock. She would have if I had asked, and therefore I did not. The look she gave Herne was the one she offers to the sun when it stares rudely through a window she has cleaned. She produced a piece of string with three knots and laid it on my table as if it were a legal document.

“The Post Office door has acquired opinions,” she said. “It has been biting pensioners. Mrs. Dawlish is threatening to declare war. Mr. Penwiddle says it’s the draught. Mr. Penwiddle always says it’s the draught. He is wrong most of the time and always certain. Bring wire. Bring your patience. Bring nothing with swearing on it; Mrs. Dawlish has been pretending not to hear cursing for thirty years and I’d hate to make her stop pretending.”

“I never swear,” I said, and Herne did not bother to make a sound because he keeps his incredulity for the people who deserve to hear it.

The Post Office’s mouth is a respectable one, wrinkled and paint-peeled and chapped from weather the city thinks of as Catholic—ritual, penance, incense that’s really steam. It is the sort of door that expects to be patted, not argued with. Skerrick had convinced it otherwise. The queue out front stood with the righteous indignation of people who know themselves to be small kings and queens for the length of a morning. A child with an umbrella that had never been taught to behave tried to feed a set of stamps to the letter-slot and the letter-slot snapped at the umbrella and took a bite out of propriety. Mrs. Dawlish had her chin set in the way that makes bakers burn their loaves. Mr. Penwiddle fanned himself with a circular he believed to be a sermon. The door glared.

“Good morning,” I told it, because you ought to begin as you mean to go on and because doors, like men, remember whether you bothered with their names. “You are doing a very bad impression of a cousin. You are not a gate. You are not a dog. You are certainly not a constable’s boot. You are a door. Your job is to be a well-behaved mouth.”

It huffed in its hinges and tried to sulk. Hinges are poor sulkers. They have too much work to do to enjoy a sulk. I put my fingers to the metal and let the bit of me that remembers weight shake hands with the bit of it that remembered having been bored. Elsie stepped into the rhythm beside me without needing directions, which is why I prefer her company to most adults. Her voice took on the cadence she uses when counting in a child’s ear to convince it not to run into the road, and she began to read the destinations on the letters that had been captured that morning and imprisoned in pigeon holes that normally only smelled of glue and tidy impatience.

“To Mr. Blight at 12, Lower Paul Street, who keeps pigeons and a wife who detests them. To Miss Pendred at the Almshouse, who writes to her son in Plymouth twice a week and only sometimes receives replies because he is ashamed of his hands. To the firm of Lack & Sons, Printers, who are neither lacking nor sons and have long conversations with their own ink. To Sister Imelda at the Convent, who knows a word for each day of the week that she will tell you if you bring her apples. To…”

Herne did not bother with the door. He spoke to the step. “Hold,” he advised it, and the step took this as a compliment and ceased to shin bark among the queue. The Post Office, after pretending it had better things to do and discovering it did not, let out a stiff little cough that could almost have been contrition if you squinted your morals. I tied a loop of wire just so at the top hinge and whispered Mr. Penwiddle’s full name into it in the old way. Names work best on things when they aren’t expecting being used as spanners. Mr. Penwiddle blushed, which is how you know magic has taken.

“When a door begins to refuse the people it owes,” Mrs. Dawlish informed the air, because she has discovered this is the safest place to preach, “then it had better be prepared to refuse bread as well. Bread does not like to be refused. It goes stale out of spite.”

“Bread is the most Christian of our foods,” Mr. Penwiddle muttered, and the door flinched like a horse that has felt a single raindrop and is bracing for twenty-seven.

“Quiet,” I told it, not unkindly. “You are a remedy, not an illness.”

The bite left its hinge. It began to behave. Mrs. Dawlish allowed the corner of her mouth to lift as if granting parole. Mr. Penwiddle took credit with a professional’s relief. Elsie pinched my sleeve when he was not looking and the pinch said, Just once, let him have his bosun’s whistle. I let him. It is a fine habit, generosity with the right fools.

The guildhall steps were next, as promised. They have no excuse for their behavior, being wide and certain and used to the weight of men with more meat on them than grace. Skerrick had gotten under their habits and told them there was a better place to be than beneath people, and so they tried to be elsewhere in small, ungentle ways. Alderman Rentlow had decided to be important before noon and found the world did not wish to support his importance. His shin met the quarrel the steps had with themselves and developed a new geography. He saw Herne only from the elbow down and made the face of a man who suspects he has glimpsed a god but does not wish to be mocked by the other gods for admitting it.

“Your step is drunk,” he said, as if reproach is a tonic.

“It has been listening to new poems,” I said. “Give it a minute and then be heavy.”

He did not care for that as instructions go. His pride tried to leave his body via his nostrils. Elsie placed her ledger on the second step and wrote, in strong, unpretty letters: Step. Wide. Good in rain. Better in snow. Holds up men without asking if they are worth holding. Barks shins only when shins forget themselves. The step read it. How do I know? It stopped pouting and tried the shape of Sturdy on for size and took to it like butter to a side plate.

“I will have words with the man who told the council to hire new steps,” Alderman Rentlow announced.

“The steps cannot be replaced,” Mrs. Dawlish said from the Post Office, because sound travels with interest when sense is in the air. “They are as old as my father’s grudges and twice as useful.”

We went to the bit of wall that thinks about cherries when the weather is undecided and the world wishes to be kind in small ways. It had soured. The sweet had gone out of the thought like love taken into a kitchen and examined. Skerrick had told it vinegar is a finer thing than sugar because vinegar gets invited to arguments and sugar waits on plates. Elsie had made me bring a paper bag of market cherries and a knife not much sharper than decency. She took a seat on the wall as if interviewing it for a position. Her skirts smudged themselves with the opinion of brick. I pitted cherries with the mindless cheer of a child set to a task that will be rewarded with stains.

“You have a temper,” she told the wall. “You have a temper because the Romans told you you were important and then left you to be painted by men with bad taste. You love fruit because fruit never lies about when it is ready. It blushes and then it is. It does not pretend when it has gone off. It has the decency to smell wrong. You need to decide if you wish to smell like arguments or like summer.”

Herne’s whiskers tested the air, collected all these words, and made them heavy. I spat cherry stones into my palm and pressed them along a crack in the mortar where water tends to gather and sulk. Mortar is improved by the memory of pits; it likes the idea of keeping what once held a sweet and feels important by the association. The wall thought about stubborn and about fruit. It reconsidered vinegar. It eased. By the time I licked a finger and tasted the dust—I do not advise this as a recreation—the thought of cherries had become patient again. I am not sure that patience is better than joy, but it does less damage when left unattended.

Skerrick had been reading his new book of small cruelties along the High the way a boy might trail a stick along a fence to hear it sing. A sign mispronounced its own name. A lamppost had decided it was an example and leaned in an apologetic way that made you want to forgive it for a crime it had not had the energy to commit. The cat that belongs to the cobbler’s shop sat in the window and glared at its tail because the tail had begun to make insinuations. We moved through it all with wire and breath and the words Elsie has learned to carry in her sleeves, and we mended. It is an arrogant verb. It assumes we have the right to make a thing remember what it is and forgives us later when we were wrong. There are better sins to take on.

Around noon, M. Harford ambushed me with tea that had almost forgiven the water for being not quite boiling. He is not a man who enjoys ambushes, so I let him pretend it was a visit. He held his hat properly, which is to say as if it had an opinion and he respected it but refused to be cowed. He lowered his voice the way a person does when he is about to expect something of you he has rehearsed not expecting.

“You will hate this,” he said. “I am beginning to hate asking. There are three children at St. David’s who have been collecting jokes at funerals. They were told the jokes would keep them from taking on the wrong sort of sadness. Instead the jokes have soured. They are telling themselves. They have gotten into the hymnbooks and made one of the hymns tell lies. I would like to make it stop, and not by burning the books, because that solves nothing and upsets women who take care of things for living men.”

“Skerrick?” I asked, already knowing that it hardly matters. Mischief breeds in the warm corners you do not sweep twice.

“Yes, I expect,” he said. “He has the look of a man who enjoys funerals even when he is not invited to grieve. Will you come and be dull at a hymn for me?”

“I will be appalling,” I said, which is in the same neighborhood as dull and sometimes borrows its salt.

We found the hymn at the back, sulking near its own spine like a child who has decided not to learn to read because a brother did. Hymns are proud, but they are also lazy. They like to be sung properly and will forgive almost anything if you sing them with sincerity ugly enough to flatter their expectations. Elsie read the first verse like a recipe. Herne lay on the marble and sent quiet down into the bones of the church that had nothing to do with God and everything to do with stone that has been begged by men for centuries and has learned to love being begged. I sang. It was terrible. It was honest. The hymn admitted defeat and the jokes shook themselves out of the margins and went looking for a better party. The children came to fetch them with a shame that fit their ears better than mischief had. M. Harford pressed a coin into my palm and I pretended I had not seen the way it wanted to turn thin as an apology.

“You are starting to look like one of the saints at St. Petrock’s,” Elsie said when we were back under the honest sky. “Not in the face. That is still yours. In the shoulders. The saints always look like they are bracing for a bucket of cold water.”

“I have never trusted a man who enjoys being dry,” I said, and she made a noise that meant she felt something and did not trust it either.

You cannot win a day against a man like Skerrick by running after him and knocking on each door he has taught a vice to. A man like him takes pride in the sound of your knuckles. We needed an ordinary procession, a sequence of tired excellences. We called it nothing. We made no speeches. Elsie called the lamplighters because they like to be asked to be exactly themselves. Mrs. Prowse fetched the ringers and told them to practice not being clever. Mrs. Yeale sent a lad in a cap whose bills had been rescued from bad influences to say the gates would open when they were meant to and shut when they were meant to and not attempt to show off. The baker with the crust everyone pretends not to unbutton on the way home agreed to take his loaves out five minutes thinner and give those five minutes to not scowling at boys who stare at bread like faith. The busker who plays the fiddle with a grudge promised to play only tunes he knows the right way through. The sweep who hates stairs because of his knees and loves chimneys because they are honest with him swore to get the stairs to accept that love is not required of them, only work. We gathered nothing. We went home and did our tasks in the same hour with the same breath and let the city be threaded by boredom.

It is hard labor to make a town tired. We walked and spoke and said the small names and tied loops of wire under this and that and left copper on sills and on the backs of the benches that always list to the left, and we were embarrassing in our fervor. Herne said stop to a staircase that had decided to be more ambitious than its grade and the staircase stopped with relief. Elsie’s little sister fetched a bucket from the well without being asked and then scolded the well for having ideas beyond its station, and the well responded by doing its work better than it had in weeks. A woman with a child on her hip pulled tight the knot on her laundry line and it felt like a bell being spoken to correctly. The sound went up into the weather and the weather behaved for twelve breathless minutes.

Skerrick paced the edge of all this and refrained from clapping because clapping would have made him one of us and that is the one thing he cannot bear. He put his fingers into a sign that had not misbehaved in years and turned the R sideways. The sign pretended to have always meant that, which is the worst sort of affliction—pride in error. I resisted the urge to fix it at once so that we wouldn’t give him the pleasure of watching my neck jerk where he points. Elsie wrote in her ledger: Sign. The thing has a name. It can wait.

By the time the lamps needed their wicks attended to, my hands had remembered how to be gentle. The lamplighters climbed, hissed, petted flame into shape, and scattered little truths into the dark. The first bell that night sounded like a woman turning over in a bed and finding it still warm from a man who had left and had the politeness to tell her. I could feel Skerrick’s attention find us and then decide we were boring and go back to trying to teach a cart to roll downhill without acknowledging gravity. It is like watching a conjurer realize his audience would prefer he count change properly.

He did not give up. He began taking pieces out of children’s pockets that ought never to have been there and turning them into causes. A marble that thought it was a pearl. A whistle that wanted to be a secret. He bumped shoulders with a man who was carrying a week’s worth of quiet in a jug and the jug fell and made an argument on the street. He taught a chimney to hate its own smoke. He wanted me to chase him. I did not. I left two wires on the green and one under the Post Office lip and went to the Holloway in the hour that feels like a missing tooth.

The Holloway had put its hands over its ears after last night and that is not a metaphor. The hedges leaned in on purpose and the path sank another inch into the certainty of being used. The lantern that would not burn out had decided to be shy and kept a modest light. M. Harford was where men go when they cannot admit to themselves that they are waiting. He pretended to be inspecting a thorn. He heard us before we arrived and made the shape of a man relieved not to be taken seriously.

“He has started teaching the idea of down to places that have always preferred level,” he said without greeting. “It makes people stumble over nothing. I am not a fashionable man but even I know this is an affectation.”

“Stairs at the greengrocer’s did a bit of that,” I said. “We corrected them with potatoes.”

“I should ask you to write me a sermon on this,” he said. “It would be very boring and thus effective. I will say nothing. Come. There is something to see that ought not to be seen.”

He took us to the back of a house whose front pretends it has never known mud. The yard had six chickens and a condescending goose and a wash-line that could put a priest to shame with its strictness. The kitchen window gave out the smell of water that had thought better of boiling. The back step had learned a new art—it had begun to behave as if it were a hole. People stepped into it and found themselves farther down than they had a right to be. M. Harford pointed his lantern’s modest honesty at the step and the step believed it for as long as the light said please. I put my hand into the space where down had been bolted in and felt nothing that could be fastened except the habit of wrong.

“Spit on it,” Herne suggested. “Politely.”

I did as instructed. It is a thing I have not done intentionally in front of a man with a collar since I was small enough for that sort of cheek to be considered charming. M. Harford pretended it was theology. The spit cooled. The step let go of its ambition and remembered it was wood under paint and had never been a chasm. The goose looked disappointed. The chickens forgot immediately, as is their right.

Skerrick had made a little shrine on the Holloway where the hedge meets the ivy that attempts to be polite and fails. He had plaited cords of tallow and salt and chalk like hair he wished someone else to notice and he had set a bit of glass in the dirt that reflected only the opposite hedge and not the sky. He had been sitting there making faces, I could tell; the grass had learned the way his ankles cross and had not enjoyed the lesson. I untied what knots had been tied. Elsie tucked the glass in her pocket and told it that it was going to need to learn to be a window with better manners. The Hedge made a noise like a lady saying bless you to a man she does not like and let us pass.

The plan that was not a plan carried us through the afternoon and into a second evening. We did not announce a procession and therefore the city did not find it necessary to be defensive. The tallow trails had all dried into petulance and could be gathered with a firm pinch. Herne breathed and men forgot to do harm without realizing they had changed their minds. Elsie read a list of lampposts into the night with the seriousness you ought to reserve for telling people your name, and the lampposts behaved as if their fathers were watching. Mrs. Prowse achieved respect from a clock that had been taught to lie about eleven by staring at it until it told the truth. Mrs. Yeale arrived with sardines in her pocket in case anyone needed bribing and a wrench in case they needed reminding. She told me in a friendly way that if I broke her gate with poetry she would use the wrench in a manner not listed in her trade books, and I took it as the comfort it was meant to be.

We were halfway down Queen Street when the day knotted itself. It did not end. It clenched. Somewhere—from the priory or the green or the bridge where the river considers itself a newt and an emperor—Skerrick did something that felt in my bones like the first tear in a shirt you’ve told yourself will hold one more year. Herne lifted his head and the sound he made was not a word and everything in earshot got very interested in being still. The lamps flickered, but not for fear. For attention. The air learned the taste of someone else’s breath. We turned as one, all of us who had decided to be ordinary in the same hour, and we saw Skerrick standing on the low parapet by the iron bridge with the unearned impatience of a man ready to audition for something beneath him.

He had a ledger. Not Elsie’s—she would have broken his fingers and the ledger would have learned to do it with her. It was older, meaner. Mrs. Rendal’s? No. This one was thin and wired like a boy who eats only ideas. He held it up and the city flinched. He began to read. It was not a story. It was a list of wrong names for things, and the wrong names had weight because he spoke them so sharply that the air wanted to bleed and got confused and bled instead into the cracks that like to pretend they do not belong to anyone. I felt my mouth lift a word that began P— and I snapped it closed because prayer is dangerous if you don’t know whose lap it will jump into.

“Stop,” Herne said.

Skerrick did not. He read and the bridge remembered once wanting to be a woman’s hair. He read and the water thought about stairs again. He read and the market stalls tried to be lists. He read and my name trembled in the stone we had only just taught to spell. He was not clever. He was hungry. It is a kind of holiness and I do not recommend it.

I did not run. I walked, which is more insulting to a man like Skerrick than anything you can do. I went up on the parapet that knew my foot and did not mind it and I stood within arm’s reach and did not reach. Elsie had her ledger out and was reading the names we know and Mr. Clegg, God forgive him, was humming a bell under his breath and Mrs. Prowse took his elbow so he would not have to watch her be proud of him. Mrs. Yeale, bless her boots, was holding a wrench and thinking about sardines. M. Harford had his lantern and his tongue and did not trust either and so was careful.

“Grims,” Skerrick said, not looking at me, because the ledger was taking all of him like a cheap god. “Do you hear how easy this is?”

“Yes,” I said. “It is easy to be cruel.”

“It is easy to say no. That is all I am doing. I am saying no to names no one asked to be called. I am saying no to your stupid knitting. I am saying no to the word enough.”

“There are worse words than enough,” I said. “There is always. There is never. There is mine.”

He turned a page and the sound leveled a boy who had been learning to whistle and had only gotten as far as a hiss. I put my hand out and did the reckless thing. I did not touch the ledger. I touched his sleeve. It was too fine. It had not been earned. He flinched. He did not flinch because of me. He flinched because my hand is a reminder of the thing we are not saying. He glanced at my fingers and saw them pass through him the way a dream passes through a man’s day and leaves him changed and he was delighted and furious in the same heartbeat.

“You are not here,” he said, and it felt like applause. “You are a rumor. You are a piece of a story that someone forgot to finish. You are the best thing I have ever broken and I have not yet put my hand on you properly. Let me.”

Herne’s tail brushed my hip with intent. I let my arm fall. Elsie’s voice rose and named a lamppost everyone has called Bob because it refuses to stay lit unless someone says his name aloud. Mr. Clegg found the fifth and offered it a memory of Daniel’s dog. Mrs. Prowse told the tenor not to get ideas. The ledger thought about closing. Skerrick did not let it. Skerrick is very good at not letting things close.

“Give me a true story,” I said, in the tone I used to use when we were boys and he had pinched something he wanted me to admire.

“I am hungry,” he said, and his mouth did the thing it used to do when he was going to say the word friend and could not stand the price of it. “I am bored. I am ignored. I am going to make a mark.”

“You already have,” I said. “On my grave. On my name. On the door. On the breath of this city. Are you satisfied?”

“It fades,” he said, as if telling me sex is not as good as supper, “and I hate that it fades. I will build a mark that does not fade. I will use you for mortar. I will use you for wire.”

“I am not yours,” I said, and it is a terrible thing to tell a man who has convinced himself that the only thing he cannot own is the only thing he ever truly loved.

He moved in the way a word moves when it thinks it is going to cut and discovers it is a pillow. The ledger slipped. This is the first miracle. He did not drop it. He had that much dignity left. He looked at me then. He saw me exactly. He let himself. It is a horrible gift. His face did not soften. He is not sentimental like that. He grew older by a day. I do not think he had intended to spend the day that way. He shut the ledger. The bridges exhaled. The water reconsidered stairs. The market remembered its onions. He put his hand on the smooth cover as if to stroke a dog and the cover refused to pretend to be a dog. He smiled without humor and less grace.

“You will die again,” he said. “You will tire. You will stop nagging the small. You will forget to read your own name into stone. When you do, I will make a city that is not yours and it will be beautiful and vicious and I will be worshiped and then I will go out into the salt and be drunk and forget it all ever mattered, and I will sleep, and that will be my victory.”

“You will be hungry,” Herne said, and Skerrick’s mouth did a quick broken thing he could not hide.

“Come, darling,” Skerrick said to me, and he meant it and that was the worst part. “Come and be a strap for me while I tie up the world.”

“No,” I said, and he laughed once, and it wounded the night and made the lamps flare and then sulk.

He leapt off the parapet, not into the water or onto the road, but into a place that had been thinking about being a road and then decided to be a thought instead. He has found ways to ignore corners until they behave. He vanished without trick. He let himself be lost by the city he had been insulting all day. That is the second miracle. We thanked neither of them aloud.

In the aftermath you are supposed to give speeches and let people congratulate you for having held up the ceiling. I would have preferred to sit down and check my socks for blood. Elsie engaged in her favorite sport, which is herding men with more pride than sense into doing what they would have done anyway but later. Mrs. Prowse told Mr. Clegg he had been fine and she would hit him with a spoon if he ever apologized to a bell again. Mrs. Yeale returned her wrench to whichever pocket of the world it haunts and offered me a tin that would turn out to be sardines and was therefore the most generous thing anyone could have done for a man who does not eat.

“I can’t,” I said, handing it to Elsie instead, and she took it and kissed my cheek in a way that made the part of my face that pretends to be a cheek feel very much like it had been acknowledged. M. Harford stood with his hat in his hands and did not tell us God had noticed. It was his best work, and I made a note of it for later when I will lie awake and need a thing to put my resentment’s head down on.

Night found the places Skerrick had not ruined and settled there like a friendship you did not expect to keep. I went home, which is an admission and I do not make it lightly. Herne went with me because he is not given to metaphors about separation being a virtue. He sat in the doorway with the patience of a priest who has come to collect a tax and discovered it was already paid. I took off my shoes. I put my hand in my pocket to find wire and found a scrap of ribbon instead. Not Skerrick’s. Elsie’s. It had been tied on a book once and had gotten itself domesticated, and now it wanted to live in my pocket and remind me that not all knots are snares.

“You will not sleep,” Herne observed.

“You must be tired of that as an opening,” I said, and he did not argue, which means he was tired of it and too mannerly to admit it.

The city turned in its sheet and found a cooler corner. The river pretended to be dreaming about stairs and giving them up as a childish vice. Somewhere a bell woke up and remembered it had meant to ring and then decided everyone would be cross and went back to pretending. I sat in the chair that has learned me as a weight and a habit and I tried to remember what it felt like to be entirely in one hour without the rest of them sitting on my lap and playing my ribs like a xylophone. I failed, which is as close to sleep as I get.

When the morning tried again to be decent, a boy arrived to prove it. He had a mouth full of freckles and the kind of earnest that makes you want to hand him a coat against the existence he is about to be bruised by. He carried a parcel that had been wrapped by someone who understands knots and not paper. He asked for Mr. Thistle in the voice men use when they are turning their hat and their pride at the same time. Herne regarded him as if he might decide to tumor into a god and it would be a pity not to have paid attention. The boy held out the parcel to me and looked relieved when I took it, which is how I know I was visible enough that morning to satisfy the good people who count and not the bad ones who tally.

Inside the parcel, when I had coerced the paper into letting go, there was a small wooden box that had been an honest thing long enough to get a bit of swagger. In it, nestled in wool carded by fingers I might have known once, lay a key. Not a promise of a key. Not an argument. A key that had been made for a lock and had been faithful to it for years and was shy with me because I looked like a man who has more locks than he deserves. There was a slip of paper on top of the key with a handwriting I could have recognized in the middle of a fire. It said: Try this at Rougemont. And be kind. It is older than sin and better mannered.

The key had been made by someone who knew that metal is not merely beaten; it is courted. The bow had been shaped for a thumb that was going to be tired in February. The teeth had nicks you could pass off as incidental if you wanted to lie. I have a poor memory for my own virtues, but the city’s locks know me to be faithful, and that is as much of a person as I need to be some days. I closed my hand around the key, and it did not go through me, and I did not go through it, and that is a miracle I do not deserve and I will not interrogate. Herne looked at me like someone who has successfully dared a child to balance a coin on his nose and is rethinking his moral superiority.

“Who sent it,” he asked, when a person with a lion in his hall should not have to ask anything.

“The hand belonged to Mr. Yeale,” I said. “The dead one. Or to the river, which used his hand. Or to the piece of my grandmother who is a bowl and keeps keys for the people she has decided to scold. I will take it to Rougemont.”

“You will take it to Rougemont,” he agreed. “And the red walls will stop pretending they do not remember your feet. And you will find a lock that has been sulking since the siege and you will talk to it as if it is a child about to be allowed pudding.”

“Skerrick will be there,” I said, because the world is not charitable enough to give me a lock and not a lion in one hour.

“He may not,” Herne said. “He is not the only hungry creature. The castle has in mind a thing it has been meaning to tell you since you were ten and stole its shadow. It will not want an audience.”

“You never forget a theft when you were given nothing you wanted and took nothing anyone valued,” I said, and the line sounded like a hymn with all the nice beaten out of it, and I wished I could put my mouth to better use than making sadness into pretty phrases.

Rougemont dozes. It always has. It remembers warmth so well that even the rain on it is a sort of reminiscence. The red stone keeps the shape of summer under it like women keep a bit of lavender in drawers they cannot afford to replace. The gate you know is not the gate you want. The key knew the difference without my having to tell it. I took the path round where boys go when they do not wish to be told about propriety. The ivy took out a comb and scolded my hair. The door that thinks it is only a hinge’s secretary pretended to be asleep. I put the key to the lock that no one tells the tourists about because it would make a fuss on the pamphlets and the pamphlets do not like fuss. It thought about it. It decided I did not offend it. It let me see a piece of the castle you only find when it has judged you likely to put the furniture back where you found it.

The room smelled of iron and something that had been cooked for a long time and only halfway made sense of its own seasoning. It was not a room you would bring a man into if you wanted him to be generous with you later. It had no patience for seduction. It contained, very precisely, an old box. Not older than kindness. Old enough to have decided it prefers men who do not ask questions until it has had its say. It had my name carved on it as if a man I had owed and loved and resented had put it there with a chisel and a certain amount of impatience.

“Grimsby Thistle,” the box said, which is an absurd sentence, and yet here we are. “You have been very rude to your city, and it has forgiven you as often as the bread would allow. You have failed to leave. This pleases me. You have failed to die properly. This interests me. You have failed to eat when offered. This irritates me. You will take what is inside me and you will use it with less drama than you prefer. Do you agree?”

“I do not enjoy being scolded by furniture,” I said, which is not a refusal and made the box snort with a lid.

“Open it,” Herne said, and he did not add please because the word had been used too often in that room and had lost some currency.

I opened it. It contained, folded as neatly as a sin a nun has kept for later, a coat. Not the one with the islands, though it had been its tutor. It was a coat meant to be worn by a man who stands in a place where other men pass and forget themselves long enough to take up their hats when they ought. It was the sort of coat you could keep a ledger in and not be accused of being a ledger. It had been stitched by a hand that knows the difference between show and keep. In the pocket was a shadow. That is melodrama. It was the idea of a shadow. It had been cut to fit me, and I know this not because it lay against my palm like something that had always wanted to be there—though it did—but because when I lifted it and held it up between myself and the wall, the wall forgot for a moment that it does not recognize me that way and remembered a boy with ears like flags and a way of breathing that made you want to tell him a slow story so he would learn. I put the coat on. It fit as if I had paid for it with something I could not spare. The shadow slid to my heels. It did not belong to me. It belonged to the room and the box and the castle and the city and the old lock and Mr. Yeale and the river and Elsie and the vicar and Mrs. Prowse and Mrs. Yeale and Mr. Clegg and the lamplighters and the sweep with knees he hates and the busker with his disgruntled fiddle. It belonged to everything I had gone insisting did not owe me anything and had failed to be right about.

“You are still here,” Herne said, and for the first time since he began tormenting me with that phrase, I believed him without also wanting to bite him.

“I am still here,” I said, and my voice held its shape like bread finds a shape when it has been kneaded long enough to offend and forgiven.

The room breathed its iron breath and attempted to keep me. I have that effect on modest places. I tied a loop of copper round a nail no one examines unless they wish to learn about old debts, and the loop said—not aloud, nothing so vulgar—He returns. The nail agreed. We left. The key in my pocket had opinions about where it ought to live and I let it. It settled next to the curl of wire and the ribbon and the useless key that opens nothing and everything, and I felt like a thief who has finally made peace with the fact that what he steals to keep are not objects, and that is somehow more honest.

Outside, Skerrick had written a message on the air in the sort of chalk boys use on the backs of girls’ skirts when they are stupid and wish to be amusing. It said: Darling. I see you. Come and see me. And then it told me where, in the manner of a man who is certain this time you will be unable to resist the drama of it all.

He had chosen the Roman bath. Of course he had. It is barely a thing anymore. A suggestion of brick and heat under it and water that refuses to forgive the centuries of men who thought it was a miracle they had invented. It lives as much in the mouths of guides as in stone. It is Skerrick’s favorite kind of truth—one that depends upon being told by a person with a good hat and a pointer. He would be there, with his ledger and his chalk and his vanity and the thing he carries as if I might fit into it like a coin he has set aside for later. Herne’s whiskers made their small comment. Elsie’s ribbon in my pocket tugged itself into stubborn. The shadow on the ground behaved. I made a decision not because it was wise but because it was necessary.

“Let us go and ask him to be bored,” I said, and if the saints are worth anything at all, let them hold me to that.We went by the alley that insists it is older than it is and past the butcher’s shutter that never learned to close without remark. The coat had opinions about pace and I let it set them because it fit me like a habit I had earned and not like a costume, and that felt like a favor I should repay with obedience. It was a small thing, to let a piece of cloth tell me when to slow and when to put my foot down as if the ground might move if I were rude. The shadow followed like a dog that has been taken in late and is still deciding whether to trust the warmth of new hands. It didn’t catch at bolts or trip men who did not see me, and twice in the glass of a shopfront I watched it keep its shape when I did not entirely keep mine and felt gratitude like hunger in reverse. Herne paced at my right and made the puddles behave as if they had had their hair combed. The city breathed as if bracing for a change of weather. I told myself that boredom was not an insult if it kept a man from burning, and I practiced a few practical sentences in my head in case Skerrick tried to make the evening a poem.

The bath is not where the signs insist it is unless you have been listening for it since you were a boy who had nothing better to do than collect old words and persuade them to stand still. The way down is a question that the ground asks you and most men answer wrong because they hear it as challenge instead of invitation. I put my palm flat to the wall that remembers being a wall without needing to boast about it and said please in the voice that hinges like, the one that does not promise any more than it can afford. The door that is not a door shrugged and became a plain idea with a latch, and we stepped into the old heat.

It is a ruin but it is not indifferent. The pillars of tile that used to hold up floors for men with better Latin than sense stand like soldiers who have learned humility in retirement and now keep bees. The channels that coaxed air from hot to hotter and back again lay open like throats that have decided to be poor and honest. The water is mostly memory, which is to say it is dangerous when insulted. The first thing I noticed was that it had been new-named. This room had regressed into cleverness. Where once it had been content to be hot and then warmer and then merely enough, it had been persuaded to call itself by words it could not afford to keep, and the words were sulking, which is worse than when they are arrogant because sulk lies flat and tells you it is peace.

Skerrick was perched on a broken bit of brick like a king on a stool in a kitchen he had decided to bless with his contempt. He had set his ledger on his knee and coaxed a candle to misbehave in a brass stick that wanted to be useful and was being punished for it. The chalk on his cheek had been redrawn to look like an accident and failed at it. He had arranged tallow braids and salt like offerings about to be mocked. When he saw the coat, he smiled with his eyes and not with any of the parts of his mouth that tell the truth about men. He looked at my shadow and his attention sharpened the way you sharpen a knife on a man’s own patience.

“You stole your way into something tidy,” he said, and even his disdain was flattering because of the care he had taken to make it sound as if he did not care. “Where did you find a tailor with such excellent manners. I should send him a note and my regards and a jar full of bees.”

“Don’t test the bees,” I said. “They have opinions. They’ll write back.”

“The coat is not yours,” he said, as if I had attempted to put the Cathedral under my hat. “It is the city’s coat. It will refuse you if you ask it to be beautiful on your behalf.”

“It already has,” I answered, and the relief I felt in having said that out loud loosened something under my ribs I had not known had gone tight. “It insists on being useful with me inside it. I like it for that. I am trying to return the favor.”

He stroked the ledger the way men stroke dogs when they wish to train them to bite later. It is a thin, mean book and the paper smells as if it has been handled by hands that wash often for show. He did not open it and I do not think that was kindness. The room had begun adjusting to his voice and I do not like early adjustments in any creature that has to be lived with. The old brick under my feet did not hold my weight with the indifferent grace I prefer; it held me because it wanted to hear what my voice would do next. Herne lowered his head and breathed, and the breath moved along the pilæ and the cracks and into the memory of mortar and made it thicker in the way a soup thickens when someone sensible adds a potato.

“I don’t want a performance,” I told Skerrick, before he could begin the part where he names the wrong names until walls forget which verse they are singing and men lose their footing because a step has been told it is a mouth. “Tonight you can have a conversation or you can have an audience. Not both. I’ve come to ask you to be bored with me. It is a gift. It is going to taste like bread without butter. It will keep you alive.”

“Bread without butter is a crime,” he said lightly, and then, lower so that the bath would be made to feel special for hearing it, “and I have no desire to live if living is going to be so insultingly plain. I kept my head bent over accounts long enough in my childhood to know that numbers are a lie told to the soul to make it behave. I have other tales to listen to now. This room knows its other names. It is a theater. It is an ear. It is a mirror. It is a… well, we can do better than baths. It will be a church if I tell it the right lie.”

“You do not have the right mouth for that,” Herne said, and the room took the word church into itself and tried it out and spat it back, because it does not like altars that demand to be admired. Lions have bad liturgical manners and the saints would do well to emulate them.

“I can smell roasted nonsense,” Skerrick said, not without affection, and balanced a coin on the edge of the ledger as if to prove he could make each small thing behave. “Do your trick. Bore me. Put me to bed without a story and clap your hands in the doorway like a nurse.”

I wanted to tell him to leave because I am at my worst when men like him pretend obedience and then dare me to be officious. I have learned that my temper wants theater the way hens want grit, and I am cautious of feeding either in the wrong proportion. I set the wire on a bit of brick that had learned to be convenient and I told the bath the words it had asked for when it was built and had then been allowed to forget because men with their shirts off brought better words and the better words brought other things you should only indulge if you are prepared to clean afterward. I called the hot room hot, and the warm room warm, and the cold pool cold, and the fire fire, and the ash ash, and the smoke a nuisance and a friend if you knew how to sit with it. I did not use Latin because the Latin would have made Skerrick perform and because the bath never truly understood its Latin except as a habit men adored because it flattered their tongues. I told stones they were stones. I told air it was a bridge and not a metaphysics. I told tallow it was for light and not for permission. It was not poetry. It was inventory. It was Elsie’s voice on market day when she lists apples for a child who is trying to learn numbers by taste.

He listened as he always had as a boy when he was stealing from a windowsill and wanted the house to believe itself empty. He listened with his shoulders. He put his head to one side as if adjusting for a new note in a piece he had played to death. The ledger tugged at his hand. He did not open it and that was a miracle we had not paid for yet. The candle beside him gave up being a genius and went back to being a stick with a good idea of its own mortality. The bath’s old heat, which cannot be measured in degrees and yet has never been anything but honest, found the parts of the room Skerrick had called ear and theater and mirror and asked them a simple question: would you prefer to sweat or pretend to be clever. Heat is rude and therefore effective. The answer was obliging.

“You are making a stew of etiquette,” he said at last, with that quick sour charm that used to get him pence enough from men who liked a dangerous boy in their parlor to buy tarts and regret. “Shall I bow and behave or will we dispense with the manners and get to the fight where I learn what your new shadow does.”

“It is not new,” I said, because the lie annoyed me. “It is a thing I owed that I am paying. It is a loan. I will return it if asked. Don’t tug it. It is tied to a nail and your fingers will learn something you don’t wish to know about nails.”

He glanced down to where the idea of me ended and the idea of light began and his face made an ungenerous shape that would have been lovely if he had been a better man. He is the sort of creature who will taste any new fruit offered him and then pretend to spit it out when the hostess is watching because he knows how to be applauded for his rudeness. He set the ledger down because the room had stopped being an audience and I had asked it to be a place where you can only bring one thing at a time. He stood up in a slow, elegant temper and came to within a hand-length of me as if we had reached the part of the play where one man slaps the other and both are elevated by the vulgarity of it. Herne did not move because moving would have been polite.

“You don’t want my apology,” Skerrick said, and it was not a question. “You did not then and you do not now because you never trusted me to have one that was not graphed in chalk and meant to be seen by more than one person. You want me to leave your town alone because you love your town in the way men love unflattering coats—they fit and they hide and they do not ask you to be attractive when you prefer to be useful. I am not useful, Grims. I am not going to be that for you. I am not going to stop being hungry so that you can sleep.” He made a face as if the word had tried to bite him. “Do you sleep with that on. How very municipal of you to wear a shadow to bed.”

“It is not municipal,” I said, because if I could not be petty while attempting virtue I would have nothing left to recommend me. “It is civic. There’s a difference. Municipal is men who like ledgers and put their names on the side of water troughs. Civic is when the trough keeps being filled even when the names are wrong.”

He looked at the ledger as if wondering if it would bruise if he kissed it. He has a talent for evident metaphor. He leaned almost imperceptibly toward me, which is not to say he intended to touch me but rather that he knew how to insult the air between two bodies. I could smell something like ash on him and I think for a moment he had set his own careful fire somewhere and dared himself not to watch it. He did not look at Herne because he cannot bear to be corrected by anything he cannot own.

“If I stand still here,” I said, because my patience can be domesticated if you give it a routine, “and I talk about tiles and ash and smoke and water and feet, and I make myself dull, and I make what you do slide right off the bath like sweat, can you bear to be the interesting one alone. Can you be interesting to yourself with no one to hurt. There’s your experiment. You’ve been bored since we were boys. You believed boredom was a sin because no one taught you how to use it. I am going to bore you. It will feel like blasphemy. It will save your life.”

He smiled and then didn’t and the moment I saw the part of him that has to make his face behave I wanted to forgive him for every ledger and every insult to every hinge. I did not. I am better at withholding than I am at grace. He touched his cheek where the chalk likes to live as if to see if it would flake, and it did, because chalk has opinions about men who sweat for once instead of pretended to. He sat back down without meaning to do me the favor and that made it precious. He put his elbows on his knees like a boy about to bargain for a knife that will make him a man. He gestured at the room in a way that said he had decided to amuse me for as long as the candle lasted.

“Tell me about the tiles,” he said, and the ledger watched me instead of him, and I do not like books that learn new appetites that quickly.

I told him about each little column of stacked squares that used to hold a floor at a sensible height off the place where fire has its mouth. I told him about a slave—a person, never a tool—whose knees had learned to complain when the wood came in wet because smoke makes different arguments in a room when the fuel lies. I told him about men who had poured wine on the floor because they liked to watch heat carry scent toward mouths that had not paid for it. I told him about water in a basin that had been laughed at for being cold and had learned to be proud of it. I told him about the sound of ash when it gives up and becomes an idea, which is something you can scrape and use to clean pots if you are clever, and I told him about urine and about laundry and about the woman who ran a business here that made soldiers feel better about their shirts, and how she was the most powerful person in the room for a decade and then married a man who could not bear to be seen speaking to her and died and was not mourned properly because the grieving were badly dressed.

Herne spoke four times, in the same tone a man uses to tell a horse not to try affairs with gates. He said hold when a crack made a noise that might be mistaken by a pilgrim for a sign. He said rest when the candle thought about having an opinion. He said hush when a tile remembered a shouted order it hated. He said stop when the ledger slid toward Skerrick’s hand with the gravity of habit and Skerrick, like a good animal who has been trained by a better, didn’t take it. We bored him. It is a form of mercy not taught to men in schools because it is not elegant and cannot be performed for the daughters of magistrates.

He lasted longer than I would have in his place. It helped that the bath is a cruel friend and would eat any performance that tried to sit above its old heat. He balanced the coin again and then let it fall before he had made it interesting. He took the tallow ropes up and weighed them and then put them down and untied two of his own knots because they offended him by their pretty. He wiped the chalk from his face into his palm and the color it made when it met sweat and tallow was unbecoming and he looked at his hand with genuine surprise and I had to turn away and pretend to listen to a pillar because pity is a strangeness I cannot afford to indulge in front of him.

“You will make a housewife of me,” he said in the end, when even his better insults had become ordinary. “You will have me mending steps and scolding doors and leaving coins where boys do not look so they can find them and believe in small benefactors again. You will have me be… domestic.” He said it like a well-bred girl says belly and pretends not to mean the word she is thinking. “I cannot be domesticated.”

“You may come visit the kitchen,” I said, and it was unkind and it was also the only way I could keep from offering him anything with an edge. “You can watch bread rise and you can keep your hands to yourself. If you touch the dough I will break your fingers with Mrs. Yeale’s wrench and she will not scold me for the use. There is glory there you cannot see because it is not asking you to fix it.”

He picked the ledger up then, quickly, like a man ashamed of how much air has filled his lungs with no permission. The room felt the bite and did not take it. We had made it stubborn in our favor and I am not ashamed of it. He opened the book and the page showed him nothing he had not already taught it and he looked, for a sliver, the way boys look when they realize their clever trick will not save their shins from the beating they have earned. He stood and the bath held him upright because it is polite to guests even when it does not like them.

“You are not a saint,” he told me with irritation that he was trying to turn into banter and not quite managing. “You will do this for a week. For a month. For a year. You will tire. You will forget your grave. You will let the shadow trail and soil and you will stop pinning it every night before you sit where old men sit to find out if their bodies will lie to them. I will be here when you stop. I will be here like mold is here. I am not proud. I am as stubborn as a bad smell.”

“Then you will have to breathe us both,” I said, and suddenly that seemed a very plain sentence and good enough to give the bath to hold. “I am tired. I am not a saint. I am a goblin with wire and a lion who says stop and a library that is not impressed by my better adjectives. I have a coat with a borrowed shadow in the pocket. I have a city that ties bells around my pride and makes them ring whenever I begin to think myself interesting. I can be boring longer than you can, Skerrick. It is a poor boast. It is mine.”

He smiled for real then, not because he liked me and not because he had been won. He smiled because he was a man who had tried to lift a thing and found it heavier than he had wanted and his back had not broken. He took the ledger and put it into the bag that had learned his hip and he made no show, which meant something. He brushed his hands as if wiping away the plain and he stepped past me and into the truth of the room without asking permission to be seen leaving. When he had gone the bath decided to smell of limes for a moment as if someone had been kind to it without expectation. I left copper on a tile with the neatness of a tip.

Outside, the alley had turned the sort of dark that insists on being walked properly and not as an afterthought. The coat agreed to keep my shoulder steady where it knows my habit is to lean when I should stand. Herne shook out his mane as if to rid it of the notion that he had been used as furniture by a room, which is not far off the truth. The street above spoke with the kind of confidence that is not loud but makes other noises adjust to it, and men took themselves home without remembering why.

“Did we bore him,” I asked, because I cannot tell when a victory is a victory unless it has a widow.

“For a breath,” Herne said. “For a bowl. For a day if we are greedy and feed it the same food tomorrow. He will search for a thing that is more interesting than you and will fail because you are not trying to be interesting. He will hate that. He will come back to something small and lie to it. We will find it and teach it to be boring.”

“Elsie will laugh at me,” I said, and was not displeased.

“She will give you a ribbon and call you a housemaid with your pockets full of wire,” he said, and there was pride in it the way men hide butter under their bread and pretend the mouth doesn’t know.

The coat carried the day back to me as if it had been waiting for me to accept it. There are gifts that keep their heat even when you put them away and that is a sort of magic rarer than any Skerrick has learned to bark. We passed the stretch of wall that counts cherries and it weighed up our talk and found it tart and was pleased anyway. The lamplighter on St. Martin’s ladder lifted his arm and for a moment I thought I saw him see Herne, and he shook his head like a man who has decided to forgive himself a story and went on with his work. The little bell tried to hop onto the hour and caught its toe and laughed at itself in so far as bells can laugh. It is in fashion to talk about cities like women to be seduced or like beasts to be broken. I find it easier to live here if I remember that Exeter is more like a very stubborn aunt who knows where the spoons are and has a better memory than anyone and disapproves of wasting time on metaphor unless it can be used later to fix a hinge.

I did not go home at once because I have learned not to bring the smell of somebody else’s work into my bed even when the bed is a chair and the smell is only a thought. We went to the green. We stood where men bring their anniversaries to be blessed by light and where children come to learn that the grass under statues is not better than the grass that lives not being watched. M. Harford materialized from behind a spur of shadow like a rabbit out of a clergyman and did not ask me to tell him what we had done because he could smell it under the words. He held the lantern that refuses to burn out and it behaved as if well-raised.

“You look like a man who has eaten a plate of potatoes and told himself a story about victory while the plate was being cleared,” he said without malice, and I like him because he is the sort of man who will put a hand on your shoulder and take it off again in the same second because he remembers your shoulder might not be for touching.

“We kept him from turning a bath into a theater,” I said. “It’s a thin sort of glory. It will do.”

“He will try a worse thing,” he said, and looked toward Rougemont in that way men do when they are trying not to believe in anything that lives under red stone and have failed again.

“He always does,” I said. “We will be stupid where he is clever. We will be exhausting. We will refuse to fetch.”

The vicar made a pleasant noise that in another man would have been a scoff and in him was a benediction on tedium. “Mrs. Dawlish asked me to tell you she has decided the Post Office door behaved under duress and therefore she will pretend never to have been bitten. I told her that was Christian and she told me not to be vulgar. It is a good city when it remembers not to use words as medals. It is a difficult city when it remembers to be proud of being difficult.”

I went home eventually because even men who cannot sleep require a place to sit down and forget that the floor has opinions. The chair had kept the shape of me with more courtesy than I deserve. Herne took the door upon his back and showed it its manners; it stopped creaking out of embarrassment. On the table lay a note folded in that way Elsie has taught it to behave when it is my business and not the world’s. It said, in ink that had forgotten not to blot, that the fair had sent a boy to say they might come in from the east if the gates agreed to be spoken to kindly enough and if the city promised not to bite their knees. The memory of the last time the fair fled the rain and our bad temper made my hands ache with ghosts of marquee ropes. I pictured Skerrick with a string of paper flags and a mind to teach them to bite, and decided I would go to Mrs. Yeale in the morning and bribe her with sardines and courtesy.

I took off the coat and folded it with the seriousness I reserve for knives and children sleeping in carts. The shadow stayed. It was not a trick. It was not mine. It was ours, and that made it heavier and easier both. I pinned it at the heel with a wire and at the shoulder with a ribbon because I am sentimental when no one is looking and because Elsie will ask if I did and I like saying yes to questions she does not want answers to. Herne settled in the doorway with his tail over his feet like he was keeping truant thoughts in detention. He did not tell me I would not sleep. He did not have to. The house was full of small noises behaving. It is a style of comfort I can stand up under.

Morning will ask us to be unremarkable at nine places and heroic in one and I will try to get them in the right order. Skerrick will try to teach a sugar pig to make a convincing argument. Mr. Clegg will draft a sermon and destroy it and Mrs. Prowse will pretend not to be proud of him. Mrs. Yeale will lean on a gate until it appreciates her. M. Harford will tell a man with a hat who thinks himself immortal to put it back on and go home. Elsie will bring me a list of things that exist and need their names reminded. I will go to the fair’s place at the edge of the city where the grass doesn’t like to be stepped on by men who sell miracles and I will ask the ground to remember how to hold gentle lies for a weekend. Herne will say stop. The city will say yes or no according to its mood and whether we have paid our small debts by then. And under it all the river will tick like a clock missing a tooth, and I will imagine the missing tooth in my pocket, and I will forgive it for not being there, because I am learning, very slowly, the domestic courage of going on.Morning put its elbows on the sill and pretended not to look at us while we went about making the edge of the city presentable for strangers. I took sardines as if they were a passport and went to find Mrs. Yeale with the sort of stride you adopt when you mean to ask a favor and hope to make it feel like a trade. Her boots were already at war with dew and winning. She did something to a bolt with her wrench that made it purr and did something to a lad with her look that made him discover he had been meaning to be useful all his life. When I offered her the tin, she made the face of a woman who likes a thing and resents you for knowing it, and waved me toward the east with the tin clutched like a sacrament. “Gates,” she said, as if dismissing gossip. “They’ve been listening to men who think fairs bring only pickpockets and pies. Tell them to remember they were built to make a road into a welcome when the mood was upon us.”

The East Gate has a habit of standing like a scold when outsiders come in company. It remembers armies better than fêtes and has never forgiven children for learning to run under it squealing. I put my hand on its brick as if it were a horse you don’t intend to ride and told it who was coming; men with ropes they would treat like brothers for a week and then sell without rancor, women with buns that made boys decide to grow up and then regret it, a man with a crooked flute, a girl whose rope would teach your eye a gratitude you had forgotten how to feel, a booth of boiled sweets willing to teach patience to mouths that had none. Elsie wrote the fair’s names in her ledger because she knows that the city will make room for almost anyone if you give their weight a place to sit, and she used the sorts of adjectives that do not make a thing blush. The gate shifted, almost prim. “You may hold your jaws,” I told it, not unkindly. “You can bite thieves later. Today you will be a threshold.”

They came in a procession that didn’t announce itself as a procession because pride is expensive and tents are heavy. Wheels complained for the joy of it. Cloth flapped the way hearts do when given a job. A boy carried poles like all his ancestors had been made of trees and leaned toward Elsie’s ledger because his soul had always wanted to be listed and had not known how to ask. The woman who had the look of a ringmaster kept her voice in her pocket until someone needed permission to be grateful and then produced it neatly. “Madam Collier,” she said when we swapped hats invisibly. “We measure first, then we argue. Your green is stingy and your air is generous. We have small lies for sale that do not stain. We will leave before we are asked politely to go, because we are professionals. This is my rope-walker, Pip. This is Mr. Finn with his organs and his opinion. That is Aunt Mag, who will say she is from no place you can visit and will nevertheless give you directions. That one there is Mr. Pottle with the sugar pig. Do not tell him he is an artist. He will begin to write a poem.”

Pip had a face that would not admit to fear until it had been spoken to twice, and hair that kept secrets the way grass keeps rain. She looked at Herne the way you look at hills; in pieces and with a plan for the climb. “I can walk him,” she said, and then blushed because she had meant to think it. Her rope made a tidy U in her hand like something that remembered having been a letter before it learned tricks. Mr. Finn showed me the front of his organ with a pride that wants a slap and then a coin and set his fingers on the pipes with the tenderness of a man who grew up with spoons. Aunt Mag looked me over in that cheerful-sly way old women have when they have decided to like you and to keep back the reason for it until you do something foolish, and then she pressed a card with a thumbprint of sugar into my palm and told me never to ask for mercy from paper.

We walked the length of the green and I told the ground it was going to have to bear gentle lies as if they belonged to it, and the ground said, in the only way ground knows, that it would if men took their boots off at least once and forswore fireworks near elm roots. We marked the pitches with chalk because rope resents being used for measuring, and Madam Collier counted beat out of habit and swore only when Mr. Finn suggested setting his organ near the Cathedral on the grounds that the stone made his notes behave. Elsie’s pen scratched like a cat that has found furniture. The lamps watched with the polite curiosity of old ladies in windows who have taught themselves not to speak unless spoken to and are delighted when obliged.

Skerrick had left his thumbprints on the road in a way that made men step into each other’s shadows; he had changed the angle of two signs so that THIS WAY began to make a man feel philosophical. I put two arrows neater and plainer on the cobbles with a piece of chalk that had belonged to a boy named Tam before he was told he was too old for chalk and had pretended to agree. The arrows were ugly on purpose. People obey ugliness when it speaks in a familiar tone. Skerrick does not understand that, which is why he keeps making beautiful mistakes and daring us to applaud.

He was not there when the fair loosened its ropes and let out its small noises. He was in the booths later, I could smell it in the way a tent flap had learned to stay open for him and then told itself a story about not having done. He found Mr. Pottle’s sugar pig and taught it to talk about famine in the voice of a magistrate. He tried to persuade the organ to play only the small notes and did not understand that small notes are the ones that ruin a tune. He told Pip’s rope that the ground was unfaithful and the rope trembled with the insult. We put boredom on everything like butter and made an honest meal of it.

By noon the city had learned that its heart can beat a little faster without falling out of the chest. Children ran toward the roundabout that Mr. Finn insisted was not a carousel because he dislikes French when he is working. The horses were painted with the sort of gaudiness that comes of wanting to reassure a child that the world can be counted on to be charming if you are willing to be fooled gently. Skerrick liked them at once, which should have warned us. He came with that sideways grace of his and put his hands under the glossy manes without touching because he does not like to leave his oil on anything that might betray him later. “Once,” he said loud enough for the bass note to hear, “you were horses. You know how feet feel under you that are more than paint. You know how men breathe when they lie. Why are you pretending to be devout now.” The left-hand dapple turned its head an inch farther than its bolt liked and if it had been able to bite it would have marked a boy on the wrist for life.

I put my hand on the pole and the pole behaved as if relieved to be noticed. “You are wood,” I told it plainly. “You are a patient thing with a job that is not glamour but the repetition of delight. Do your work. No one is asking you to be more beautiful than your paint.” Mr. Finn went still, which is a trick on a man who fidgets like a doctrine in a lazy preacher’s mouth, and he hummed the old notes underneath. Herne made a noise like a yawn at the back of the organ and the pipes decided it was sensible to breathe as instructed. The horses ceased remembering their teeth. Pip set her hand to the brass and let the children run past and put their hands out for the circles as if the world had finally been made to give them the right shape of joy without making them steal it.

A conjurer named Foxfire—because he thought he had invented the color and I did not want to tell him it belongs to fungi and to lies that refuse to admit dawn—found me at the edge of the fortune-teller’s tent and looked me over as if deciding whether it was safe to sell me a secret. He had a neat trick of producing a coin from his mouth and making you forget to be afraid of where else the coin had been until after he had pocketed your attention. “You are untidy,” he said without introduction. “Not in your coat. In your outline. I could fix that for a price. You’d be surprised how inexpensive outlines are if you’ve got the right needle.”

“I can’t afford one more thing I have to take care of,” I told him, and Aunt Mag snorted in approval from inside the tent and rattled a string of beads like someone shaking a door to see if it will break.

“Suit yourself,” Foxfire said, and looked at Herne as if someone had just told him Latin was a prank they are still playing on schoolboys. “Does your cat bite.”

“Only when bored,” Herne said, and the conjurer laughed and let boredom be a knife he would not take in hand.

We did not make speeches about safety. Madam Collier grumbled something about fire buckets and men took the buckets into their hands and then forgot they had them because forgetting is a town’s way of trusting itself. Skerrick slunk in like weather and tried to move the pins an inch and found that he had, for the moment, been outnumbered by women whose hands had learned not just knots but the humor of knots. He went to the mirrors because mirrors will always listen to him.

The Hall of Wonders was six sheets of glass that had found reasons to be proud and a seventh that had decided to be shy and therefore persuasive. Children went in and came out taller or shorter by inches and thrilled by the illegality of the change, and fathers went in and came out quieter and mothers went in and came out with their mouths set and laughed to correct the thing that had been set in it. Skerrick stood where the light has to choose whether to be generous or cruel and saw at once the easiest theft in a room like that. Shadows. The world makes its bargains with shadows without telling the people who sign them. He told the mirrors to remember their old trick of eating them.

Pip fetched me by the sleeve because she is a sensible creature and has learned not to let men explain a problem before they begin fixing it. “They come out lighter,” she said, not frightened yet, which is the best tone in which to deal with certain monsters. “They aren’t noticing. But you will.”

I noticed. You cannot ask a city to remember you and not learn to notice how men wear their own weight. A boy came out of the mirror house with his hand in the air as if holding the string of a balloon and his mouth made a shape as if it remembered something that had just left him and liked the leaving. A woman stepped out and adjusted her shawl as if embarrassed and did not look at her own heels because there was nothing at them that could catch a dust mote. A shadow is not a fine thing. It is not even interesting to draw unless you are a kind of artist I do not have patience for, but it is honest. Skerrick stood a half-space inside the tent and began to tie them up with thread that had been meant to keep a hem for a day and to be thrown away and he looked delighted by the extravagance of cheapness.

“I’m going in,” I told Herne, because saying a thing aloud makes it less elegant and therefore more likely to be useful. “If I don’t come out, pull the mirrors’ names down off them and leave them naked.”

“You will come out,” he said, and the tone was not promise or threat, but inventory, which I prefer.

Inside, the air took its own measure. Glass likes to be told it is something else. It complicates its own loyalties that way. Skerrick had gotten under its habits and made it think it was a virtue to swallow a man’s edge. The frame had learned a new word for hunger and was excited. He stood with the ledger near his fingers, which meant he was trying not to use it and only almost succeeding, and a ribbon of silhouettes bled up the inside of the farthest pane and sat there like punctuation that has been misused and can’t forgive the sentence for it. He did not turn when I came in. He had learned a new thing and would be difficult.

“Put them down,” I said, plain.

“They are happier without them,” he said, and you would have believed him if you had never lost anything you loved and had to admit you could carry the want of it. “People have decided to be burdened by being the shape the world makes of them wherever the sun is rude. I am relieving them. They call me a conjurer and thank me and then go and eat sugar pigs and give their coins to the organ as if the organ had a belly. This is charity.”

“Shadows make men think about where they are,” I said. “They keep your feet from telling you lies when the road is proud. They make you remember that your body owns you no more than you own it. Give them back.”

He lifted a strip of boys and girls and men and women in the mirror as if testing the weight of the sentence and smiled with his eyes because he had gotten the idea under his tongue and liked the taste. “Or what,” he said, and his tone was not challenge so much as confession. “You will lecture me. You will be dull. You will put your hand on the back of the frame like a midwife and make the child behave. You are in your element, Grims. This is domestic work. This is the sink, not the stage.”

“I will be very, very boring,” I said, and took out the wire.

The trick, if it is a trick, is no trick at all. It is tying. You find the piece of a thing that has convinced itself it is alone and you give it a friend with the same taste in knots. I ran copper from frame to frame until the mirrors began to notice each other instead of their own opinion. I knew their small names because Aunt Mag had told me them once after I had fetched her a kettle she could not be bothered to lift herself, and because I had kissed a girl here and confessed to the glass afterwards, and because I have spent my life holding foolishness steady until it turns into habit. Elsie stood outside the tent and began to read the names of children in the county and then the names of men and women no one names on purpose anymore but who keep the city in flour and who can tell you how long a loaf lasts if you stop being proud and slice thin. Herne breathed very gently and the glass, which likes to think big, considered the virtue of small.

Skerrick watched me, delighted and disgusted, with his hand near the ledger and his shoulder learning how to behave properly against his will. He came closer because he cannot help himself when work requires proximity. He reached for a thread and I slapped his fingers; it was a bad slap, because my hand does not always agree with me on where it ends, and he laughed once, a man given permission to be pleased with his own flesh. “Darling,” he said in the voice he uses when he asks men with hats for gifts they have not believed they would wish to be seen giving, “you are very married to this town.”

“So are you,” I said, and there was a mercy in saying it that startled me. “You just don’t like saying the vows aloud.”

The first shadow dropped with a little indignity, the way a cat pretends to come down because it decided to and not because someone has called its name. It threaded itself up a calf and found the heel and sat, embarrassed. The second slid like water into a cup, and the third made a show of it because children are allowed to be vain when no one is bleeding. One refused to move, and it was the one I had dreaded. It belonged to a boy whose ears had not made peace with their size and who had decided to go through the rest of his life first in the hope that by the time he reached his face he would be wiser. He stood without his shadow as if that might keep his mother from seeing what had been taken from him, and his mouth made a little stubborn line because he was not going to ask me to help.

Skerrick held his thread and looked at the boy and did not smile, because sometimes he is too clever to demonstrate his own cackle, and said very quietly, for me, “You will have to put something of yours back to make his fit. You don’t have enough.”

“I have wire,” I said. “I have a coat. I have a lion.”

“You have no shadow to spare,” he said, and the ledger made a small, eager sound.

Herne’s breath altered. It is like the city’s own heartbeat when he does that, and I can pretend it’s poetry until the moment when the walls nod. He spoke two words and made glass remember that it breaks rather than starves, and that is a kindness in a room like that. Aunt Mag, outside, told a joke about a bishop and a girl who knew the price of nails and laughed as if she had never practiced it before. Elsie read the boy’s name twice, once the way his mother did when she meant scold and once the way she would remember it if she ever had to say it to a stone. I cut a piece off my borrowed shadow with careful fingers, because you can do that if the thing you hold has promised to return, and I pressed it into the boy’s heel and it stung me under the nail in the way a word sometimes does when you realize you have misused it. He looked down without letting his heart look, and then he looked up at me with that fury children are allowed to spend for free, and then he went to find his mother and show her he had kept his feet and learned something vulgar about men.

Skerrick did not try to stop me. He would have liked to. He wanted to take my fingers in his mouth as if biting them could teach me something about owning and owning back. He kept the ledger shut because he is a vain creature and hates to be seen begging for an instrument. When the last shadow went home and the mirrors became poor again, I tied a loop of wire and left it under the frame and told the glass to forget fancy. It pouted. I did not apologize.

Outside, the fair had learned how to laugh without shivering. Men with opinions found themselves with their mouths full of buns and discovered new graces. Madam Collier counted again and put her hands on two ropes and made them behave because they like her and fear her and the latter is as important as the former when a woman has tents to keep up. Mr. Pottle made a sugar pig that did not talk about famine and sold it to a child and did not write a poem, which must have cost him something, and I admired him for it. Pip walked her rope in her stockinged feet with something like a prayer on her face that had nothing to do with God and everything to do with feeling where skin ends. She came down with coins in her mouth because she is a practical girl and did not trust pockets, and spat them into her palm with a dignity Mr. Finn could not imitate.

In the lull that people pretend is not a lull because to admit it is to invite bad weather, M. Harford appeared with a hat he had finally trained into a shape that would not alarm parishioners. He watched the children with a look men do not have the courage to call love and therefore call concern, and then he gave me an expression that wanted to take back yesterday’s kindness and found it could not. “I have had a day in which no one attempted to be saved ahead of schedule,” he said. “It has frightened me. I intend to be unfriendly about it in the pulpit just to restore the order of the world.”

“If you tell them boredom is holy they will smuggle theater into the pews,” I said, and he accepted this as a weather report.

Herne stepped between us with the careless grace of a creature who has decided to be the door the world did not know it needed, and for a second the vicar’s eyes did not go around him. They sat. They made room for lion. He did not come over faint with awe, which is how I know he is worth bothering with. “Sir,” he said, as if greeting a magistrate he did not like and had decided to humor for the public good. “If you find a way to make this town more stubborn without making it proud, I would appreciate an appointment to discuss it in detail over beer.”

“I will breathe,” Herne said, which is the sort of claim men cannot make and therefore pretend they meant when they said promise.

Skerrick did not leave. He slipped sideways into the stalls where odds and ends sell themselves with the help of words that have learned to kiss. He has a talent for finding the corners of other men’s appetites and making boasts sit down where they do not wish to be. He tried the strongman’s bar with two fingers and made it light, because he likes to be courted by iron, and the strongman did not miss his chance to look amazed and then to look offended and then to laugh and take his coin anyway. He stood in Aunt Mag’s doorway and pretended to listen and then left with a face that said he had been told the truth and wished he had not asked and is therefore going to invent a better one. He went to the edge where the green thinks about the road and he stood with his hands behind him because he had decided to be resisted.

He did not look at me when I came to him; he watched the crowd for the way a city moves when it is pretending to be less complicated than it knows it is, and he smiled the way a knife does when it knows it will fit a man’s hand. “Darling,” he said, and maybe he meant it as a comedy and maybe he did not. “What will you do when the fair goes. You can knot your city until it holds itself up forever and never learns to dance. You can teach doors to keep their teeth in and steps to hold and bells to keep to their own weight and children to wear their shadows like shoes. You will die of it.”

“Do not carve my stone twice,” I said. “It is expensive and I am already in arrears.”

He glanced side-long and failed to be amused; he was thinking too hard to enjoy himself fully. He let his hands fall and his fingers made the old shapes without meaning to—two for take, three for leave it, one for later—and I nearly reached to hold them still and then remembered pride and jackets and let him keep his gestures. “I will open a door,” he said, and his voice did not take pleasure in announcement for once. “You will not be able to resist a door. I will not be able to resist a door. We are both going to be fools.”

“Where,” I asked, because I am a glutton for maps and a man has a right to know which of his hours is going to be borrowed.

He nodded toward Rougemont with the little dip of the head he used to keep for old men who gave him pennies because he had let them tell him a story. “Down a stair that is not there until you wear your new coat, and through a room that once remembered iron properly, and into a throat of red that does not like to be touched. The key in your pocket knows the way. It will think it is refusing and it will not.”

“You will follow,” I said, because we both know what his face looks like when a hinge pleads to be tested.

“I will arrive ahead,” he said, and smiled with that quick look of a boy who knows where the cakes are hidden. “I will call it a courtesy. You will call it theft. We will be both right and Sunday will come and the bells will try to correct us.”

Madam Collier raised a whistle that could have summoned kings in a different country and sent the fair to its midday. Men sat down and noticed the weight of their knees and women checked their purses with the half-kindness a purse deserves and children found the least decent patch of grass and rolled in it until they discovered why parents name stains. The city took a breath. The river remembered there were fish under its skin and let itself pretend to be interested in them. The smell of onions that have decided not to burn filled the air like a lowly miracle. I wanted, for a silly moment, to put my head on Herne’s shoulder the way boys put their heads on the desk when the master announces an extra hour of arithmetic and pretend he could take the weight even if I could not give it. I did not. I watched Skerrick watch the red of Rougemont turn into a dare as the sun slid an inch and made it look like a mouth.

“Later,” I told Elsie, when she tugged my sleeve and reminded me of the list of small things left to be made dull. “There’s a door.”

“There is always a door,” she said, and folded her ledger shut without asking me to agree. “Bring back what you have borrowed if you can, and if you cannot, bring back only your coat. The rest we can make again.”

Rougemont did not change to accommodate my coat; it has the courtesy of old things, which is to be stubborn. Its heat lay down like a memory in the stone and refused to be roused by anything as crass as footsteps, and the ivy pretended it had never met me, and the path pretended it had always been for the use of men who do not sweat, and the lock in my pocket pretended it had never liked my fingers and then came to heel when I whistled a tune Elsie claims I do not know I hum. The red throat of the little stair showed itself like a girl pulling up her skirt an inch when the weather makes men ridiculous and let my shadow pass before it would let me, because it is that sort of old gossip. Herne came after with the patience of something too big for the frame that has learned not to demand new doorways as his right. The key did not fit so much as persuade the tumblers they had better look alive because a lion was in the hallway.

Down below, in a room that has learned how to be cool because it respects heat, Skerrick had found a hinge with pretensions. It had once belonged to something important enough to make small men stand straighter. It had been put away in a box and forgotten the dignity of being used. He had it open with an insult and a coin and had planted his foot where it used to be a sin to plant feet and was waiting like a man in a theatre who knows his cue and is bored by the play. The room did not hold him well. He is too much opinion for storage.

“You cheated,” I said, because I cannot let a man announce himself and not be corrected, and because it reminds me that our roles are costumes we keep putting on and not our faces.

“Always,” he said, and held the hinge up like a cup. “Come now, coat. Show me your pockets.”

Herne did not speak. He put his head against the arch and the arch considered for the first time in a century that it might be wrong about a thing, and that amused it enough to behave. The door was not a door to anyone but me because I had been a boy here once and violated the order of a house and learned the way dust keeps secrets for children that it denies to priests. I used the key in the lock that told the story of having eaten many keys and loved only one, and it took mine like bread and, like bread, made me forgive it everything. The way down was a slope rather than steps, because the men who built this place believed in wheels, and that made me less steady than pride would like. I kept my hand on the red to keep from falling. The red kept its memory of heat and told me about soup and about arms and about women who decided they would be the ones to run and were looked at askance and did not mind.

The throat emptied me into a place that had not decided to be a room. It was like standing in a thought before a man writes his sermon; promise and ambition and no embarrassment yet. The walls were raw and wanted naming and that desire made them dangerous. Skerrick stepped into it with the old beautiful carelessness that used to make me want to follow him everywhere and now reminds me of the smell of boys when they have not learned to wash. He held the ledger as if men were watching him and he had to act as if he did not care, which is a greater performance than any he has sold for coin. He turned a page and the air realized it had never thought to protest the act of a page being turned. He smiled as if a temple had sighed under his hand.

“You will call this foolish,” he said, and for once he was almost asking. “You will say it is a bigger version of all my smaller crimes. You will tell me that if I name the underside of the city wrong the top will trip and drop its teeth and be embarrassed in front of men who will never forgive it. You will say that I have no right to teach walls new habits because walls forget how to forgive their own pride if you meddle in their subtle art.”

“I will say you are hungry,” I said, and the red room liked that word; it has been bread and brick too long not to. “I will say I am as well. I will say the difference between us is only that I have decided to be sated by the small and you will always be starved by the grand, because you cannot keep it in your mouth long enough to taste it.”

He laughed and let the ledger fall against his hip; it had been making him stand wrong. “You would be a better priest than the good man. He does not enjoy arguing with God the way you have learned to enjoy arguing with hinges.”

“I do not enjoy any of it,” I said, and for once it was not a performance. “Enjoyment is what you teach dogs to do when you want them to fetch and then you do not let them keep the stick. I am trying to be useful. There are lesser games.”

Skerrick put his hand on the wall like a lover who intends to be clever and not kind, and the wall answered him, because men like him do not waste time being gentle, and walls are tired of waiting for men to get on with it. The red decided to be a mouth. I saw it in the way the corners rounded and the way the sentences I had been keeping inside me went damp. He meant to speak a name into it that would put the map on its head. He meant to call Southernhay north and the green a river and the Cathedral a set of stairs and the stairs a clock and the clock a mouth and then to enjoy the panic while the city flailed and learned a new dance badly enough to make men fall down on market day. He wanted to put his thumb on the place where the town keeps its kindness and make it slip.

Herne spoke very quietly. The red of the room is older than any of us, and it did not expect to be complimented; lions are poor flatterers. “Stop,” he said, and the room paused not because it had been commanded so much as because a weight had been placed in its lap and it did not wish to disturb the baby. Elsie would have said the right thing, which would be naming in the correct tone, but Elsie was out under the sky doing six small holy things none of which required her to get dirty. I had the coat and the wire and a pocket with a ribbon in it and a key that had decided to pretend it did not belong to me anymore and therefore was going to be difficult.

I put the copper to the wall. I tied a loop so simple that a child could have told you its name and why it was done that way, and I told the red that it is the color of brick and bread and blood and not of mouths that wish to change a lover. I told it how the fair sits on it like summer that has a job, and I told it how a boy fell here once and prayed only after he stood up and found himself without a bruise, and I told it how the first cat in Exeter found sun on this stone and decided to forgive us for our dogs. I gave it the inventory. I bored the rock.

Skerrick’s hand tightened and the wall tried again to be a mouth, but it was a mouth trying to remember Italian having only ever heard it in jokes. He opened the ledger to make the insult formal and the page stayed white. Not blank; white like a thing that has been scrubbed and refuses to be written on again because it has learned to be proud of its labor. He frowned and looked down at the corner and saw, because he is not a fool when it comes to the grammar of pages, a filigree of wire that had nothing to do with my pocket. Rougemont is a better mender than any of us. Someone had made loops here before me and tied them under the plaster, and when Skerrick’s ledger tried to sip the white, the loops said, in the voice of an old man cheeks-deep in cider, no.

He pivoted, the way he always does when disappointed, toward delight. He leaped onto a new idea because he cannot bear the grieving for long. “Then I will eat you,” he said, and smiled at me and did not mean flesh, not entirely, because he is not a cannibal of bodies, only of names. “I will take your good habit, Grimsby. I will take your knots. I will teach the city to tie itself cruelly. It will be so orderly that it will no longer be able to make a mistake, and then it will die and let me write an elegy that will be sung for a hundred years and it will be ugly and the ugliness will be worshiped. I will make my church.”

“You will be hungry,” Herne said again, and Skerrick’s eyelids wanted to nap under that sentence and he would not let them.

We stood a while like that, in a heat that the stone remembers and that makes men talk nonsense. I tied three more loops for politeness and for my grandmother, who used to smack my hand if I did a task only once. Skerrick tracked each loop with his eyes as if one might confess to being a keyhole he could fit. He put his hand flat, with all the boy left in him, and whispered what he once whispered over stolen plums: mine. The wall did not listen. It has been called worse and by better mouths.

He went then, because some interiors teach even Skerrick his limits, and because his hunger had become the sort that makes men go and put their faces in the wind and remember they are animals before they remember they are saints. He did not slam anything because there was nothing to slam. He took his ledger and his chalk and his vanity and he left, and the red of the room became brick again and thought about soup. I left copper for the door in case it felt taken for granted. I left a knot for the hinge and a ribbon under the key for the river because it likes jewelry when no one is looking.

When we came back up into the afternoon, the fair had put out its later light as if to test it. The lamps along the green were thinking about their evening faces and Mr. Finn’s organ had learned how to be a contralto with a cold and was enjoying itself. Madam Collier had a row with a boy who had forgotten to mind the stake at the back of her biggest tent and the boy had the decency to cry where only I and Herne and the stake could see it. Elsie found me with ink on her wrist and a stubborn relief in her grin that made me ache with loyalty to her ledger. “You did not break it,” she said, without checking first if there had been anything to break. “Good. I did not want to have to make that speech. It has verbs that make my teeth itch.”

“I only tied knots,” I said, and she patted the ribbon in my pocket because she is cruel in ways I can bear.

Pip decided to test one last run for the evening. The dusk had come like a thing unashamed of being thin, and men had begun to believe they were handsomer under it. Her rope went up between two trees that have never minded being asked to accommodate spectacle so long as they are spoken to like elders. She walked with her breath in her teeth and her feet arguing with the air and her arms the sort of wake a boat makes when it knows it carries women who have done enough dishes for one lifetime. Skerrick stood under her, not out of cruelty—the boy in him is not a murderer—but because he is attracted to the place where gravity goes weak and courage becomes show. He wanted to name it and could not, because some words will not be named when a ledger is in the room.

“Don’t,” I said, not to him, to the bit of air under her that had learned to listen to his voice and felt like being witty. “Be boring.”

The word went up like a step under her feet. She took it as if it had always been part of the rope. She did not stumble. She did not bow. She hopped down at the end like a cat that has agreed to a trick and asked for a fish and got a pat instead and decides to forgive you because it will be funny later when you discover the fish is missing. She put a coin in her mouth and took two more in hand and then spat all three into her palm and counted them with the righteousness of a banker who knows which side of the river pays taxes.

“Tomorrow,” she said, not looking at Skerrick, because she has sense enough to know you do not stare at an ache. “I will do it in rain.”

“Tomorrow,” he answered, and I do not think he knew to whom he was promising.

Night took its trick knives and its cheap jewelry and blued itself. The fair put out lights like fruit and men came to the edges of their own borders and decided not to cross them after all because they were tired and in love and more ashamed of one than the other and could not say which. The river ticked the way it does when it wants to pretend it has a secret to tell and only ducks for company. We walked the perimeter the way prudent thieves walk a house; hands in pockets, eyes down, ears pleased to be speaking to the familiar. The city had taken the weight we put into it as if it had been coin and it meant to pay interest. We would have the bill tomorrow and a new door and a new ordinary to make useful again and again until the day after after and the day after that and then the one after, which I intend to be my favorite and which will arrive without warning like all good visitors.

When we reached my door, which has learned to have patience with lions and never rewards them for their charm by letting them in first, there was a piece of paper under the mat because Elsie has made conspirators of us all and she enjoys training furniture. It had a drawing on it that a child had done carefully and without art. It was of the green with the fair flags and a square with a line for a mouth and Mr. Finn’s organ drawn as a rectangle with spots and a lion that looked like a pot with teeth and a long, careful shadow at the feet of a man in a coat. In the corner, in the handwriting of a person who could not decide whether to be proud of knowing letters yet, it said: thank you for giving my shadow back. It made me hurt in all the honest places.

Herne flicked his tail against my pant leg and looked very hard at nothing, which is how his face looks when he has decided to be kind and not let me accuse him of it. I put the drawing on the table with the key and the ribbon and the coil of wire and the sardine tin Elsie had returned to be a box for screws, and I folded myself into the chair as if I had invented chairs and the city were the more interesting part of the arrangement. The night did its small business, which is all we ask of a night and more than we deserve. I did not sleep. I listened to the quiet and invented a hymn about boredom and did not teach it to anyone and was, for a breath or two together, grateful for that.
