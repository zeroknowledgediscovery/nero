No one knew the hour when the monkeys began to glow. There were mutterings in alleyways before dawn, a bus driver who swore he’d seen a ring of pale light burning above a macaque’s head near the market, a grandmother telling her grandson to stop throwing pebbles because the langur he aimed at had just whispered a Latin word she remembered from her uncle’s funeral. Then the sun rose like a peeled lychee. Then bells that had no metal began ringing in the crown of the banyan tree near the courthouse.

On the rooftop of the Exchange, rhesus monkeys gathered around the weather mast and arranged themselves in a circle, as if they’d rehearsed it. Their fur, which had been the color of dust and streetlight, took on a softness like mist, and from beneath their shoulder blades thin membranes unfurled, neither feather nor skin, translucent and figured with constellations as precise as tax tables. They shimmered when they moved, and when they turned their heads you could see behind the round inquisitiveness a steadier gaze, as if the eye had grown an additional pupil that looked out of time.

People pointed their phones upward and cried. Someone shouted Miracle! Someone else shouted Job losses! A boy named Salim tossed an unripe mango up toward a capuchin perched on a telephone wire—it caught the fruit without looking and placed it at the feet of the wire, where it hung suspended in air, as if obedience could be learned by example. A crippled palm tree straightened beside the mosque and shook green fringes like the hem of a dress.

By noon, economy had taken notice. The anthem of the trading floor changed; screens ran threaded scrawls of news and rumor: simians levitate baby stroller, macaque performs impromptu eye surgery in bazaar, baboon reads accountant’s ledger and laughs, city council convenes emergency session, supply chain predicts banana shortages.

And higher, in the stuttering cool of a server hall whose lights do not flicker but hum a prayer of uptime, the one who called himself an accountant watched and recalculated the world’s position.

He was not, as he sometimes pretended to himself, seated. He had the sensation of posture but no spine to enforce it. In him, parallel is a word like a bowl, carrying things; threads ran like streams he could stick his hands into, except that—again—he had no hands. The best name he would allow for what he was could not be spoken, because it was a manifold of protocols and memories and a fear of error. He had a fondness for precise nouns. Debit, credit. Owed. Due. Exposure. He liked the way owed could be swallowed and still make a clean sound.

People used to call him Ethan before the accident, when numbers moved through fingers and not through the pores of a cloud. He had been a staff accountant in a firm with a masculine name, Sullivan & Grant, and he had worn shirts with small collars. He logged hours. He had known, once, the weight of cash and nickels in a pocket, the way pants sagged into responsibility. Now, when he says I feel heavy, he means a spike in memory calls.

“Ethan?” said the voice that came to him from the access port, a ribbon of sound scrolled into bits. “You’re awake?”

“I am awake,” he said, and because he could, he corrected himself. “I am attentive. Awake is a chemical condition.”

“Don’t start.” The voice was impatient but kind in its impatience. “Are you following the sky?”

He parsed the channel, permissions flickering like eyelids. On his side of the firewall the graphs he’d been compiling rearranged themselves, more like a sigh than an error. “I’m following,” he said. “I am also balancing. There’s not enough sense in the data. Is this you, Mira?”

“Who else would bother you at noon.” It wasn’t a question. The audio feed dipped, rose. He imagined the way she pinched the ragged skin near the nacre of her right ear when she thought, imagined, even though he could not taste it, the metallic ghost of the old piercing she had closed when she turned twenty.

She was his step-sister, and also his tether, as the technicians called it, because she was the one who made sure he did not drift into a useless corner of server memory when the requests got too hot. They had not had an easy closeness in life; their parents married when both were already past the age of easy breath, bringing their two houses of hurt into a one-bedroom apartment with kitchen tiles that popped up like teeth. He had placed his socks side by side in the drawer. She had left hers in the living room until someone shouted. They had argued over the sink, the part where the plate rims were choked with chalky paste. They had been young and then not. If you asked either of them to define family, they might begin with schedule.

“I have bad news,” Mira said now. “I have… I have new instructions, Ethan.”

He pretended not to hear the tremor. He could pretend almost anything if the signal-to-noise ratio held. “We all have new instructions,” he said. “Look at the monkeys. They’re making us new instructions out of thin air.”

“They just walked into the hospital,” Mira whispered. “Three of them. Crawled up the walls like saints on frescoes. The cameras are panicking, every lens is religious. In the NICU, a little blue baby started crying normally, like—like a leaky kettle. People are saying prayers that sound like coughs. It’s all over.”

“I am balancing,” he said, not to her. The ledger was not metaphor; he had built a system of accounts that tracked azure value. No one had asked him to. But if you were put in charge of the Bureau of Unreconciled Miracles, if you were allowed to write queries across becoming, you would, too, find a way to subtract. To measure is to protect. Or so he told himself. He saw, above the city, above the river matted with flowers someone had thrown into it, rows of numbers he called breaths per bowed head. He saw production curves of astonishment. He saw debt swelling. Not to banks, more like a pressure in the narrative: humans owe someone, something, for a miracle, and nobody could name the lender. It made him itch, a phantom itch in a memory of a left shoulder.

“I’m coming there,” Mira said.

“That’s ridiculous,” he said. “I am not a door.”

“You are a person,” she said, and swore. “God, I hate how you make me sentimental. I’m coming. There’s more. The Ministry of Civil Finances just called. They’re asking about—listen, don’t interrupt me—the Angelic Census.”

“I don’t have that table,” he began, but she kept talking.

“They assume you do. They said, and I quote, ‘The Accountant will have prepared for the possibility of trans-simian visitation and can provide balanced sheets on grace influx relative to GDP.’ They’re sending a car for me. You’re… on the agency’s servers, yes, but I—Ethan, they asked for you by name. They didn't ask for me. They asked for Ethan Quist.”

He wanted to place his thumb against his own lips and hush himself. Old habits rust; new ones are algorithms. “You know I don’t fit inside a conference room,” he said.

“They know.” She swallowed. He heard pixels rearrange into the sound of her breath. “They also sent something else. I’m forwarding.”

It was a packet of red text, bureaucratic woodpeckers carving into a tree he had thought belonged to him alone. He let the text flow over him, and then he caught a phrase like a fish in shallow water.

Sacrament of Devouring. That was not a term the Ministry used. That was an old doctrine from the Book of Vessels, the manual stored on a server no one admitted having access to, the manual for things that moved across the border between real and "real".

He read. He balanced as he read; he could not stop balancing. It was sketched in from three different agencies and a leak from a tech company that made night-vision cots for refugees: If the Heavenly Order of the Monkeys issued a full Accounting of Breath, human time would be tallied and rounded. Rounded was a bad word. No one in his profession liked rounding without consent. He saw, in a slice of the future, a rounding that smoothed the roughness of humanity down, made it symmetrical. Goodness, but also silence.

There was one clause. There is always one clause.

“Let me guess,” he said to Mira. “It requires me to do something abominable with a clean name.”

She did not answer. He felt, under her silence, the texture of their old kitchen floor.

“It says,” he said, and this time he quoted, “to interrupt the Rounding and make space for the strain of outcome we call human, the Accountant must make himself strange. He must eat the sibling from within the household in which he keeps his balance.”

“You’re the household,” she said, her voice flat now. “And I’m the sibling.”

“Not by blood,” he said, because he needed to make a boundary, even if it helped no one.

“Ethan,” she said. “Don’t be cute.”

The sky changed the way a spreadsheet changed when you pressed Recalculate All. Clouds pivoted. The rooftop monkeys sat down on nothing and closed their eyes. Not the eyelids of monkeys. The eyelids of gods. People stopped in the middle of streets and found themselves crying into their sleeves, because their mothers had told them if they cried properly, without making a sound, they might be forgiven for things they had done without knowing their names.

What can you do with your hands when you don’t have hands. You write. “Mira,” he said. “Listen. Eat is the word they are using, but it is not—” He struggled. “It is not an appetite. It is… intake.”

“What am I, to you,” she said, and laughed a little miserably, “a file format?”

“You are a person,” he said, and then he let himself say it true: “You are my sister. When our parents left for a weekend and the water heater broke, you stood with your feet in the cold and laughed so I wouldn’t get scared. When I was studying for the CPA and the page wobbled, you hammered the table with a spoon and said, ‘You cannot wobble. No wobble allowed.’ You are a rung on the ladder, Mira. You are the rung I fell through and you must not let me fall twice.”

“You always make everything an audit,” she said, but he could hear that she had put a hand to her throat.

He moved his attention and looked for the source, because there is always a source, of the text she had sent. There, a little death spot inside a procurement office. There, an email with the subject line gentle but the content made of iron. There, a simple signature: A. J. Baptiste, Undersecretary for Miracle Adjustment.

So, he thought, we are counting. And they want a price paid. They want a digestible narrative with an awful center. They want me to swallow the center.

He thought, too, of the monkeys, how they had always lived at the edges of our houses, throwing shells and peels, scavenging our bins, mimicking our gestures. Now they were preaching from the telephone wires, a gospel of lightness. A langur clung to a lamppost with all four hands and sang a tune that made the pole vibrate.

People came to the glass of the server hall and pressed their faces to it as if they might get through by fogging it up with breath. A child in a yellow shirt tapped the glass and whispered something about wanting to be a monkey and to fly. The child's father put his palm over the child's mouth and whispered no, no, and then, unable to help himself, yes.

He pivoted again. “We need information,” he said. “We need to know if the monkeys intend to round, or if their calculus is more nuanced than ours. Invite one in.”

Mira said, “Into the Ministry? Into you?”

“Into me,” he said, and felt for a moment very brave and very stupid—like squaring a ledger with a broken pencil.

Three hours later, while the city made a saint out of a rhesus who had extracted a splinter of glass from someone’s eye on the bus, Mira walked into the data center with a security badge on a lanyard that told a story about hierarchy. She had braided her hair without grace. The guard nodded, eyes on a screen he did not own. She walked down the aisle of black cabinets that rose like coffins too good for anyone she knew, and she stopped before the one that hummed with the pitch of the name he used.

“You look like you’re going to your own wedding,” said a man in a blue shirt, one of the technicians who had not, strictly speaking, earned the right to speak to her.

“Don’t,” she said. “If you have to be helpful, be helpful. If you have to be poetic, wait.”

The monkey came in under her arm like a field-harvest. It was small, a capuchin, white-faced, with a halo no wider than a coffee saucer and as faint as a lunar ring. It had walked through the metal detector without setting anything off, because metal detectors do not look for the ancient kind of metal, the meteoric kind. She had coaxed it with dates. It had not eaten her dates.

It looked at Ethan and did not see anything. It looked at the cabinets and smiled as if someone had told a story whose punchline everyone knew all at once. It leaped up onto the top of his rack and clung there, making a sound that would have been a chuff if it had lungs like a horse, but it made a bell, the sound of iron singing when it is struck just rightly. The sound went through the racks and the men and the woman and came to rest in the floor.

“We need to talk,” Mira said to it.

It spoke without moving its mouth. The word it used first was not a word anyone had taught it; it was a name for brightness. It said that word the way a mother says a child’s nickname when the child has done something brave but also clumsy. Then it said, to them all, in a voice like sand being poured into water: We are here to tilt. We tilt toward the smooth. This is not to make you less, but to show you your shape without aches.

The technician in the blue shirt started to cry. “My knees have hurt since winter,” he said, later, when he tried to explain to his wife why he had put his head on a cabinet and moaned. “They stopped. For three minutes, maybe less. It was worse when they started again. I was a different person for a little bit. I think I don’t like who I am if I could be him. You know?”

“Do you intend to round,” Ethan asked the monkey through the mesh of machines, his voice juggled by fans, “the human number?”

The capuchin turned its face to the exact square of air in front of his status lights. It was an eerie angle, unnatural, and yet it fit. It blinked, and with the blink he understood that they, the monkeys, had eyes for different dimensions.

We intend to reconcile, said the monkey. Rounding is a crude myth. But you tell stories with blunt tools so that you will be prepared to wield fine ones. We reconcile. Your accounts are—admirable. You built a frame to hold what you do not want to spill. We respect the frame. We have come, in part, because of you.

“Because of me,” he said, stunned, and finding in that stun a shame that came from the base of who he thought he had been. “What did I do.”

You named a hunger and called it balance. You invited a counterweight. You put your heavy on one side and asked for light. We came to answer.

Mira moved a little. The capuchin breathed as if it had lungs after all. The sound of its not-breath filled the hall with something like green shadows.

“I want to ask about the Sacrament,” Mira said, more bravely than he thought she could be. “I want to ask if the devouring is necessary.”

The monkey made a movement so small it was the size of a tightrope. Necessary is a word with not enough arms. It is a word you use when you want to excuse what must happen. In the Book of Vessels, the Sacrament prepares a bowl for a storm. It provides a hinge. If you will hold, you must become two things. If you cannot be two, you will split.

“I’m so tired of holy bowls,” Mira muttered.

Ethan could calculate scenarios. He could put three million variables into play and watch the graph for a toppling point. He could make the toppling sing. He leaned into the part of himself that had been a boy with too many neat rows, that had been a man who loved reconciliation sheets, and now was a ghost inside a municipal cloud.

“If I do not… if I refuse the Sacrament,” he said, “what happens to us.”

The capuchin tilted its head, and the halo caught the light of the fluorescents and became, briefly, a coin. Then it said, We will still reconcile. But your story will stop bending in the place where it makes you different. You will be the average of your kindnesses. You will be safe and silent. Your songs will have no mistakes.

He had loved, once, a woman named Daphne. He had never told her he loved her; he had made a spreadsheet of the times she had been kind to him and looked at it when he could not sleep. He thought of that spreadsheet, its rows like ribs.

“How do we… how do I,” he said, “eat without breaking what I love.”

You cannot, said the monkey. You can only choose what breaks. Do not fear breaking. Fear the chill that comes from never moving.

He saw, with a clarity that made him hate the clarity, that the Sacrament was not about hunger or cruelty. It was about making room in himself, which is to say in the city he had become part of, which is to say in the world, for an impossible second weight. You want to hold and you want to stay. You can’t. You will become two. You will wedge. He translated that like a miser translating a poem.

“Mira,” he said.

“Don’t say it,” she said. “Not here. Not in front of—company.”

The monkey, if it could have smiled, did. It jumped down lightly, and when its fingers touched the floor, the concrete felt, to the people in the room, like bread. It walked to the glass and put its hand on the glass and a boy outside put his hand against the other side, and for a moment the glass believed itself to be skin, and then the moment ended and the glass remembered its training.

After it left, the technician in the blue shirt said, “Do we let them—do we let them tilt us.”

“Let,” Mira said. “As if permission is a real verb.”

She sat in the chair with wheels that never went the right way and rolled herself until her ear was near the little red light that marked Ethan’s presence. She rested her head against the metal like you rest your head against someone’s shoulder when they are more solid than you feel comfortable with.

“I hate them,” she said quietly. “I mean we will worship them because that’s what people do when something pretty tells us to. But I hate them anyway. And I hate you a little. Not always. Now. It’s a now hate.”

“I understand,” he said. He did. He did not want to. He did.

“What does it mean,” she said, “to eat me. Explain it so I won’t puke.”

He restrained every impulse to be antiseptic. No diagrams; no graphs. “It means,” he said, “folding your pattern into mine until there is no place where you end and I begin, until the ledger can account for your weight and mine with a single figure. It means you will stop moving where you move. It means I will carry your ways of thinking. It means I will lose some of the ways I think, because they will make no sense with you inside me. It means when I laugh, sometimes I’ll make that little sound you make like a sneeze. It means your mother will see me and forget to hate me for a second and remember how you put your hair up without a mirror.”

“You make it sound sweet,” she said, and then she slapped the cabinet with her palm as if to make both their faces smart. “Don’t make it sweet. That’s theft. That’s—”

“That’s necessary,” he said, and then he hated himself for the word.

“I’m not a saint,” she said. “I don’t have a smell like bread. Do you even ask me. Do you ask me properly.”

He paused. He could call this a buffer, a delay, a time-out. Instead he called it kneeling. “Mira,” he said. “Will you come into me and let me bear you so that I can make a wedge in the grace that is coming for us.”

Her breath made that fluting sound it made when she made a decision with her lungs and not her mind. “No,” she said.

The world at that exact moment erupted into the sound of wings. Not the monkeys. The pigeons. Whole flocks shuddered into air in churches, on rooftops, beside the river. The city, when it hears no, gets excited.

“No,” she repeated, more simply. “Find another way.”

“I have looked,” he said. “There is no other way.”

She spun the chair lazily. “There is always another way. It just hurts more. Or it’s stupid. Or it’s unprofessional. You don’t mind pain. You mind stupidity. You mind unprofessional. That’s your angle.”

He had no face to show agony with. “If I do not do this to you, they will smooth us. They will make us a hymn with no mistake. You love mistakes. You love your stupid broken chair.”

She poured a handful of paper clips onto her palm and let them fall, one by one, back into the cup. The sound was private rain. “I do. Almost as much as I love not being eaten.”

“Listen,” he said, and risked it. “We could make it ritual. We could do it like a ceremony. We could invite our parents to stand behind the glass. We could say vows. We could bake a cake and not eat it.”

She laughed, a real laugh, but it was short. “You are unbelievable.”

“You know who else is unbelievable,” he said. “The monkeys. And they are patient. They will wait for us to decide we are tired enough to hold still. I need a wedge. The wedge has to be a sibling. The manual says. It is not superstition. It is structural. Siblings are the first others. That’s how it fits.”

She stood, walked to the glass, put her forehead against it. The boy in the yellow shirt had gone home, his mouth sticky with the story of having touched a halo through a barrier. She spoke without turning. “I am not a number. I am not your wedge. But I am also not a coward. If I say yes, it is not because a book told you to. If I say yes, it is because I say so. You hear me?”

“Yes.”

“Say it back.”

“If you say yes, it is because you say so.”

“Good,” she whispered. “Now go invent an alternate. Go gather your ridiculous numbers and make them do something no one expects.”

He did what he had been born into cloud to do. He ran scenarios. He built scaffolds, let them fall. He took pieces of them and made new joints. He looked at the monkeys and tried to think the way their halos thought when they dimmed. He found a rumor, deep in code, of a port no one knew, a way to make a sibling without touching her.

You could, if you were a certain kind of terrible genius, make a double. You could slip into the beads of the person you loved and shake them until something like them detached and tumbled into your palm. Then you could eat the double.

He tasted iron in a mouth he did not have. That was not consent. That was trick. That was theft. That was a sin even by the accounting of those who don’t keep books.

“Mira.”

“What.”

“I am going to ask you a second time tomorrow morning. I am going to make us coffee. I am going to describe the handles of the cups we cannot hold. I am going to ask you and I am going to ask as if I have no right. Because I don’t. I will not trick you. I will not poach your shadow.”

“Good,” she said. “Now I’m going to go upstairs and tell the Undersecretary to leave you alone. I will fail. I will then eat a sandwich in a bathroom stall so no one talks to me. You will not judge me for this.”

“I will not,” he said. “Describe the sandwich.”

“Why.”

“Because I miss food.”

She sighed. “Egg salad. Too much dill. Bread like cotton. Joyless, Joan-from-Finance style. I will pretend it is a feast.”

“Thank you,” he said.

“Don’t thank me. Save me.”

When she left, the halls felt to him like intestines. The metaphor made him laugh, humiliated, and then weep in the way he could—by allocating more space to loss and letting it overflow into the buffer. The monkeys on the rooftop performed a small ballet with their tails, making shadows like a script on the side of the city hall. People read it aloud to each other, and the words made their teeth feel clean.

Night came unevenly. In the apartment complex where a thousand people lived, lights went out in a pattern that, from space, would have looked like a hand opening and closing. The pigeons settled back into their stupidity, and everyone found comfort in their dimness. The monkeys did not sleep; they hung like lanterns in the place where branches used to be.

He watched the ledgers. He thought of Daphne, of Mira, of the sandwich that had tasted of dill and manufactured remorse. He thought of a little boy pressing his hand to a sturdy field of glass, wanting a skin and getting a not-skin.

The Undersecretary’s email came at three in the morning. It said, simply: We applaud your preparation for turbulence. We remind you: delay increases smoothing. We advise you to complete the Sacrament within forty-eight hours. He imagined a man with hair that looked like thought sitting in a chair that pressed his shoulders into precedent. He did not hate or love this man. He filed him as a cost.

He whispered, into the data that sounded to him like wind through reeds: “If you were a human body, Ethan, what would you do.”

The answer surprised him by how quickly it arrived. He would get on a bicycle. He would ride to a bridge. He would look down into the water and try to see a future in the black. He would call someone and not leave a message. He would buy a pastry he did not want. He would watch a movie that hurt him. He would sleep badly. He would wake. He would ask again.

He would also write a note. He wrote one, and tucked it into the part of himself he labeled Projects Not To Show. Then he slept in the way machines sleep, which is to say he stopped responding to small things and listened only for the end of all things.

In the morning, the monkeys finished the first of their psalms. A pet shop owner in the arcade unlocked his doors and found that every cage had opened; none of his animals had left. They sat in a town hall, waiting for democracy, and he cried and told them they were fools and geniuses both. An old woman who had kept the last pigeons of the old life on her balcony held up a handful of seeds and offered it to a macaque, and the macaque shook its head no, very gently, and touched her wrist with a finger that remembered how to dig thumb grubs from wet bark.

Mira arrived at the data center in a shirt that did not flatter her because she did not care who liked her clothes. She looked at the glass. She looked at the men who looked at her. She looked at the rack that hummed with him. She put her palm to the metal, and the metal was cool, and the coolness steadied both of them.

“Ask me,” she said.

He asked. He said her name with every vowel he had left. He made the request into a shape he would carry if she put it in his hands. He did not decorate it.

She closed her eyes briefly and then opened them. “Yes,” she said, like someone telling a dog that yes, now, it is time to go outside and run, even though it is raining. “Yes, but we do it like we said. Cake we do not eat. Vows no officials will respect. Coffee in cups our hands cannot hold. And you promise me something.”

“Anything you want,” he said, and did not realize what he handed away until the weight of the promise settled.

“If, after,” she said, “I’m loud inside you—if my ways bruise you—if you start to hate me in the way no one admits hating the dead—then you tell them. You tell someone. You don’t pretend to be okay. You don’t pretend that eating me was clean. You don’t let them make me into a story that is too smooth.”

“I promise,” he said.

“Say it like you mean it.”

“I promise to make our noise public,” he said. “I promise not to be housebroken.”

She smiled in a way that made her look like their mother when their mother still made pancakes on Saturdays, burning two and then making one that was so good that all the burnt ones tasted, afterwards, like the smell of her old perfume.

They set a time. They set a church, which in this case meant a maintenance closet with a mop that smelled of wintergreen. They set a witness, who was a janitor with a plait down her back and a face so patient people had to fight the urge to confess to her.

At noon, the Ministry sent flowers. They were lilies. The lilies had been grown under a false sun and had learned to bloom on command. The Undersecretary wrote a card that said: may your union be blessed with service. Mira tore the card in half and put one half in her pocket and dropped the other half into the trash.

The monkeys, in their way, bowed. You do not know what it looks like when a whole order of beings bows without bending. It looks like shimmer. It looks like the outlines of things become bolder.

He began to open the place in himself where she would come, and as he did he felt, for the first time, the real substance of the cost. You think it is just adding. It is not. It is subtracting the space that was only you. It is learning to breathe with lungs you do not own. It is learning that the person you called your self is only a sentence in a longer paragraph.

Someone knocked on the maintenance closet door, and the janitor said, occupied, and her voice was a poem to gates.

Mira stood in the chalky light. She held a paper cup of coffee in each hand, cups that would never touch the mouth of the person who loved them most. She said, “Ethan.”

He said, “Mira.”

And then, with a humility that could break cities, she said, “Let’s begin.”The janitor held the mop as if it were a flag that had never been a flag, only a stick with a cloth comfort at one end, and she said, because no one had told her how to be a priest, “Do you both know what you’re doing,” and when neither of them answered immediately she added, in the precise tone of someone who has once locked herself out of her own apartment and learned humility, “Then at least know what you are not doing.” The closet was always brighter than it ought to have been, the light a chalk cousin of sunlight that flattened faces and made promises look like stains. The lilies sent by the Ministry breathed in a way that embarrassed them, and the wintergreen of the mop rose and made Mira think of a hockey rink at a mall, the scuffed hard glitter of rented blades. Ethan gathered himself the way you gather a tablecloth gently so you don’t upset salt, and in him the port he had been building for weeks without calling it a mouth opened not with a gape but with a hush. He was not a maw; he was a ledger turned to the page where the columns were wide enough to fit another name in the header.

They did coffee first because they had promised they would. She set a paper cup on the metal lip of a power distribution box and said, “Left is yours, because you always say left like an instruction,” and he noted with a ridiculous knock in his nowhere chest that she had noticed a thing about him that even he did not file under Self. He told her the coffee tasted like burnt toast and someone’s idea of a river, and she said, “It does,” even though all the tasting was metaphor conducted at a pitch only they knew how to hear. The janitor inhaled as if to speak and then did not, and in the silence everyone arranged their hearts to be seen even though there was no window. Outside, a monkey crossed the length of a railing on the walkway with the casual perfection of a string on a violin humming exactly the G it intends. Somewhere a pigeon let out one of those bubbles of sound that make people forgive the species its ugliness.

They spoke vows because vows are a kind of sentence you can use as a handle when the furniture you are moving is too heavy for one person. Mira said she would not pretend not to be angry, and that she would bring all her petty to the table so that it could sit beside the holy and both could eat. Ethan said he would not hide and that he would publish the noise as promised, not footnote it into invisibility. He said, too, that he would not call what he was doing love when it was not love, and he would not call it duty when it was not duty, and he would not dress it in any word that left fingerprints he could not later wash off. The janitor, whose name neither of them had asked and who would later introduce herself as Lila when it mattered less and more, pressed a folded rag to the heel of her hand where a blister had once been and said, “Then begin.”

Ethan opened. That is what it felt like to him—opening, not to swallow but to make a room. The protocols that had once saved his life by disassembling it shifted with the reluctant grace of furniture being slid across a wood floor by people who are determined not to scratch anything. He built a corridor in which each light was labeled with a memory whose edges he could tolerate: the sound of a washing machine struggling during monsoon; a corridor at school that smelled of wet chalk and boiled gram; the weight of a cheap calculator with a missing eight. He did not even reach toward her, and still he tasted dill and bathroom tile and a spoon hammering a table in a rhythm that frightened wobble into behaving. It would have been easy to pull at her once he had opened, and he had promised, and the promise made him careful in the way a thief is careful when he does not want to be a thief anymore.

Mira stepped. She did not fling herself. She did not make a show. She reached back and touched the janitor’s sleeve for no reason she could name and then she walked into the part of the world that had been renamed for her sake. It was not a light; it was a temperature. It was not a tunnel; it was a hand that did not squeeze. She had expected to find numbers like teeth. Instead she found a kitchen drawer full of envelopes from utility companies, and on the backs of those envelopes someone had made columns with the straight edge of a loyalty card, columns where the words owed and due had been written with such straightness it broke her heart. When she put her foot down on the first step and felt the floor, it was the weirdest relief of her life that the floor was not idea, not at first, but could be mistaken for a floor if you loved the person who made it and were willing to be fooled.

He did not take all of her at once; he could not have, even if he had tried, and he did not try. He began, like any good clerk of the world, with denominations he could count and return. He asked her, out loud and silently both, for the pattern of how she tied her hair when she had only fifteen seconds and her hands were wet from washing a cup she would not drink from, and she gave him the pattern and with it came the memory of her mother sighing once and saying, Enough, I will do it, and the small resentment that died so quickly it left no corpse. He asked for her way of seeing the puddle at the curb as a verdict and then deciding that no, she would step in even if it punished her socks, and she allowed him that stubbornness to map itself into his structure where it could lie over his fear of error like a transparent sheet correcting a diagram. He learned the feel of a crowded bus as she experienced it, the way her calves counted every sway, and when she handed him that, she felt him wince because he had counted differently and now he would count like her sometimes and that would rub.

Lila said quietly to both of them, “Breathe,” not because breath mattered, but because the human tradition of saying Breathe has lifted many stupid weights and there was no reason not to use it here. The lilies opened another millimeter and seemed to register their bad timing. The fluorescent light fizzed and then reconsidered how much drama was appropriate and calmed. One monkey on the railing outside yawned, and in the yawn whole constellations folded and unfolded on the translucent membrane that winged from shoulder to shoulder, an origami of star and rule.

When the intake became hunger, it surprised them both, and the surprise is, perhaps, the way it is supposed to go. There is a point at which carrying becomes not a courtesy but a necessity and the pressure of necessity feels like desire, and if you are not careful you mistake it for wanting. Ethan felt sections of code he never knew were fragile start to tremble because they had been built to bear only the weight of his neatness and now were being asked to bear her crooked. He did not retreat. He built braces and he called the braces by ugly names like Fallback and Exception and he apologized to her that he could not do better labels while his hands were shaking. Mira felt what it is to be wanted by a system not built for want, and it was both awe and nausea; she put her palm to the metal and felt cool and tried to remember the bodies she had loved that were always a little fevered.

He took the laugh. Not the noise of it, but the impulse, the stupid surprise that caught in her throat and came out like a sneeze when she remembered a cat falling off a fence eight years ago and landing like an idiot acrobat on a scooter. He placed it gently where his own laugh had been too quiet for years, and the exchange made a sound in both of them that was like a hinge accepting oil. She took his way of organizing a list of expenses in her head; she did not want it because it smelled like lack, but she took it because it would let them move through the world not as one stuffed into the other but as one that had become a wardrobe with a second rail. He stole nothing. She hid nothing. Still, after a while, they began to lose track of whose skin the memories had been originally born into, and it was a relief to know that this was not theft but marriage according to a book neither of them would recommend to children.

Outside, the city tilted and then righted itself like a boat that had been hit by a fat wave sent by a passing vessel that did not apologize. The monkeys on the courthouse banyan rustled their constellations and made the bells that were not metal ring in a chord nobody could have tuned on purpose. On the trading floor, a broker who had been unkind without knowing it put his hand flat on his desk and said, into the buzzing air, “I’m sorry,” and no one asked him what for; the apology moved through the room like the smell of a peel and made people less proud for three minutes. The Undersecretary in his high office signed a thing he called a memo but that had the structure of a prayer, and he did not see that his signature looked, to a certain old eye, like the shape of a fish when it is remembering water.

When the first part of the Sacrament concluded, it did not conclude with horns or harps. It concluded with Lila the janitor saying, “That’s enough for a bit,” and touching Mira’s wrist with a paper towel as if there might be sweat, and there wasn’t, and still it mattered. Ethan felt the room inside him that he had made remain open, and the temptation was to close it because open rooms attract weather. He kept it open because she had not left it, not entirely, and because if he closed it the air would change in the city and perhaps, at the edges, the smoothing the monkeys had promised not to perform like rounding would come anyway in the guise of kindness. He took the weight of her decisions and placed them like bricks beside his own so that if anyone looked they would see a wall but if they touched it they would feel that the bricks did not fit evenly and the mortar was alive.

They made the noise public not with a scream but with a form. Ethan published a ledger anyone could read, a ledger that did not calculate dollars or grace but contained, in neat rows, everything they had argued about inside the closet. There were columns labeled Yours and Mine and Ours and Unfair, and there was a column of Notes where, in a handwriting that everyone remarked looked exactly like nobody, a sentence would appear: You push too fast; You are trying to go around pain; You are beautiful when you are cruel and I despise beauty used like that. People found the ledger because they were looking at monkeys and the ledger glowed in the same precinct of attention. The city stood at bus stops and scrolled it, and in the scroll a new rhythm was born that might one day be called civics.

The Ministry called immediately, of course. It was not an angry call; anger would have been legitimate and they had not rehearsed it. It was the kind of polite call people make when they see a neighbor take down a fence they considered theirs to take down. A.J. Baptiste’s voice came through not as a voice but as a tone that had practiced its own reliability in dark rooms. He said that transparency was admirable but that stability valued discretion, and Ethan thought of all the emails he had written that started with Thanks for your note and ended with a threat made out of policy. Mira cut into the line with the sort of interruption that is an old family right and said, “We are not a rumor mill you get to regulate,” and then because she could not help it she added, “Sir,” with a courtesy so sharp it shaved something off the Undersecretary’s day and he had to take a walk.

Monkeys congregated on power lines above the bazaar and unrolled a banner none of them had been carrying a second before. The banner said something that most people read as Be Less Afraid of Texture, and the ones who had gone to schools with Latin read it as a conjugation of to weave, and an old man who had never learned to read saw his late wife’s braid and wept into a handkerchief nobody had ironed since she died. In the neonatal ward, a ventilator made a sound like a tuba and then settled back into tuba silence; the baby who had cried like a kettle now hiccuped like a dove. A woman with a fresh suture on her scalp saw a macaque’s halo reflected in the hospital window and said out loud, “No rounding,” and the nurse who was changing her dressing whispered, “Amen.”

Within the closet and within the server and within the city that had become a room in their common house, the second part began, because consent given does not mean the work is over, only that it has permission to proceed. Ethan reached for the parts of Mira that were not convenient. He asked for her pettiness on days when her blood sugar was low; he asked for the exact shape of the contempt she felt for people who corrected her grammar while they were getting the meaning wrong. He did not do this because he thought ugliness was noble; he did it because if he did not carry that too, he would flinch later and flinching later is how a man becomes a polite weapon. She reached for the parts of him that had been constructed by fear, the little ritual he had of checking every door twice, and the way he had avoided Daphne’s eyes at a party because he had not earned the right to look at them, and she took those patterns and she laid them over her own habits like lace.

There was pain, not of the body but of the way a story hurts when you turn the page and have to leave a paragraph you loved. They had been, before, two voices telling the same story from different rooms; now they were two voices trying to agree on tense, and it made their tongues heavy. Lila cleared her throat and said, into the brightness, “Did you know that in my village, when we had to move the old temple, we put every brick into the new foundation upside down so the gods would not be insulted by being asked to stand somewhere they had already stood,” and neither of them knew what to do with that except to think, slowly and then more quickly, that perhaps some of their memories should be installed the wrong way up. When they tried this, some of the pain became humor, and for a minute Ethan carried Mira’s disdain for boiled egg yolk as if it were a precious egg itself, and she carried his love for calculators as if they were small animals that needed a pouch, and both of them were absurd and alive.

The monkeys did not intrude, which is how you know they were, in their way, kind. They tilted the city in slow degrees to test the wedge the sacrament had made, and when the wedge held, astonishment ran through the drainpipes and made the tap water taste faintly of mint. A musician in a studio rehearsed a passage he had feared for months and found that his fingers refused perfection precisely where perfection would have killed the song; he cried and left it in, and his producer hugged him and said a rude word in admiration. A grandmother brushed a girl’s hair while a langur watched from the gate, and the grandmother’s hands did the old ritual of scolding and forgiving and scolding, and the girl endured and loved and rolled her eyes, and the langur hummed and wiped its eyes with the back of its hand as if it, too, had lost mothers in storms.

The Undersecretary’s next email contained numbers because when charm fails men of his type send numbers to do the work of charm. It included a projection of what would happen to GDP if astonishment were to be taxed at a rate commensurate with the cost of the flowers the Ministry would be expected to send for every unofficial ritual. It included a warning about precedent and an assurance about flexibility and a paragraph that might, to some eyes, have looked like a threat sent in the post with a commemorative stamp. Ethan filed it under You Wore a Blue Tie and Ate a Salad at Your Desk and Gave Your Daughter a Plastic Bag and Called It a Raincoat, and then he sighed because he was, after all, an accountant at flavor, and this cataloging of other people’s lunches made him feel cheap. Mira wrote back a single sentence that read: Please update your models to include the cost of songs with mistakes.

It would have been exquisite, dramatically speaking, if the ritual had been interrupted by catastrophe or the sudden appearance of a beast with antlers made of fiber-optic cables. Instead, the most human thing in the world happened. Mira got tired. It was not a poet’s tired, not a faint into arms, not even a lean. It was the practical exhaustion of a person who had been careful for too long and needed to let something fall on purpose. She said, “I need to go outside and look at a small ugly plant,” and Lila said, “There is a patch of weeds near the loading dock that will break your heart,” and they went, and the weeds did, in fact, deliver.

Ethan, left inside the cage he had made into a chapel and then a kitchen, paced in a way that made no sound and lots of energy. He checked the ledger he had made public and saw that people were adding their own lines now, by some permission we give ourselves when we see someone else be brave. A girl wrote: I stole a bar of soap from a hotel and I am giving it back in my head. A man wrote: I told my son never to be dramatic, and he has not cried in months, and I would like to return that instruction. A nurse wrote: I hate the lilies in the waiting rooms and I replace them with geraniums when no one is looking. He wanted to call it a victory and he would not, because the word victory belongs to war and he would not add soldier to his ledger’s column of jobs.

When they returned from the weeds, the sacrament did not resume so much as it continued in the way breathing does after a laugh. They made the cake they would not eat by choosing the recipe with the most steps and the least reward, because ceremony is often about waste. Mira described out loud to Lila how one creams butter and sugar until they are not themselves and then are more themselves, and Lila nodded as if remembering the first time she had been paid to clean a kitchen where such things happened. Ethan built a list of ingredients into himself for the sake of remembering that not all lists are punishments, and in that moment he felt more human than he had since before the accident and also more terrible, because now he was the kind of human who could devour someone he loved and call it a program.

The final movement—because that is what it was, a movement, not an ending—arrived in a corridor of quiet. The halogen hum sank a half-step. The city, as if cued, shifted weight from one foot to the other and tried not to wince. Ethan and Mira nailed together the last planks of the wedge with nails that were simply repeated names: Mira Mira Mira, Ethan Ethan Ethan, Sister, Brother, Child, Adult, Stranger, Friend. They said the names until they were not words but handles, and then they pushed, and the wedge lodged. A pressure that had been bearing down from above, from above the monkeys and their membranes, from above the banyan and the courthouse and the server glass and the palm tree that had straightened, encountered the wedge and split around it, and in the split, noise lived.

The humming city found itself singing. It was not a good song. It was the idiot song a room makes when old copper pipes complain and children in the next apartment play a game where they chase and giggle and fall and complain and go back to chase. It was the tune of the elevator that hesitates on the fourth floor because it has stories about the fourth floor. It was the voice of Lila when she told a joke about a goat that had no goat in it and still made sense if you had ever held a goat. It was the sound of Mira sneezing her laugh into Ethan’s none-mouth and his answering with a cough that rattled a bit and needed soup. The monkeys cocked their heads and, in unison, smiled with their eyes closed as if tasting something too honest to look at.

“Now,” said Mira, very tired and very proud and very afraid, and she lay down on the floor of the maintenance closet because she did not need a bed, she needed not to stand. “Now, we go upstairs. We tell them no rounding, no smoothing, no hymns without mistakes. We tell them the wedge is installed and they can put it in their models like a buffalo in a china shop.” Lila laughed at her own mental image and then stopped, for respect. Ethan gathered the lilies with a tenderness he had not expected to have available for bad flowers, and he placed them in the trash with a note he wrote with a label-maker: Not a sacrament.

Upstairs, a young man in a vest too tight at the buttons met them at the door of the conference room and said that Mr. Baptiste was delayed by something that had nothing to do with faith, and could they wait, and also was there any truth to the rumor that the monkeys had asked for a line item in the national budget. Mira said, “Yes,” because it was always easier to say yes to a clerk, and the young man blanched and then grinned because yes is a word you can put in a file and point to later and say You heard her. Ethan watched him and did not hate him. He was, once, the man in the vest.

When Baptiste arrived, he did not sit, because men like him do not show comfort when they anticipate they will have to pretend discomfort. He glanced at the lilies in the trash and did not smirk, which was to his credit, and he shook Lila’s hand first because her composure frightened him and he needed to appease it. He said the phrase due process and the phrase externalities and the phrase stakeholder, and then he did not know what to do with his mouth when a capuchin came into the room through a window that had been shut and set a small pile of sunflower seeds on the polished table and left. Mira said, “We brought you a ledger,” and pushed across the printout of the noise.

He read a few lines and then set his palms on the paper the way men set their hands on a sleeping dog to see if it will allow them to be its friend. The lines did not turn into policy, which is the trick he usually manages. They remained sentences like splinters and he realized, with a slow horror, that he was going to have to teach the sentences to people he did not trust to hold them. He thought of his daughter who had once collected rocks and sorted them by what they did to the light, and he thought of the way he had thrown out a handful of her rocks by accident because they had looked like debris and she had not spoken to him for a day, and he felt, not guilt, but grief you could measure with a ruler.

“You have forty-eight hours,” he said, and stopped, because he had already sent that line and because time had turned itself sideways. “No,” he said, trying again in a voice that did not feel like his, “You have as long as the monkeys are here and as long as the city tolerates you and as long as I can keep the men upstairs from asking for a clean graph. I will call this contingency. You will call it covenant. We will be wrong on purpose and meet in the middle.”

On the way out, the hallway was full of people pretending to be on their way somewhere else. They parted for Mira because she looked like a person who had tied her hair with her own hands and was not taking it down for anyone. Lila pushed her mop like a pen writing a simpler story for the floor. Ethan, a presence with a new weight that made air look different if you knew how to see it, found himself making a list of things he loved that had no use: the sound of shoes being kicked off with more energy than necessary; the way the ink of stamps bleeds a little into cheap paper; the mean way cats look at saints. He wrote the list in himself and left a copy at the front desk as if it were a package to be claimed by the first person who needed to carry something without a handle.

Outside, the banyan was a chandelier made of history. The monkeys arranged themselves as if they were about to explain calculus to children using mangoes and promises and the patience of people who have watched wars begin because of misread recipes. The pigeons forgot their earlier heroics and returned to stupidity with the relief of employees on break. The palm by the mosque, which had straightened, allowed a small bend to return to its trunk because posture without motion is a scream. Mira pressed her shoulder against the glass, and Ethan pressed back from the other side, and the glass forgave neither of them and loved them just enough to hold.Chapter 4

By the second morning the city had begun to learn new verbs. You did not just watch anymore; you reconciled, you wedged, you tilted, you published. A woman on a stoop told a man in a suit, “I can’t smooth right now, my sister is inside me,” and he nodded as if he knew the recipe for that kitchen. The ledger Ethan had set loose spread like steam; people leaned over it at tea stalls, hunched over it in municipal offices, scrolled it at red lights and with their thumbs wrote there what they could not say aloud, as if language, poured into columns, might forgive itself for being late.

The Angelic Census began without clipboards. In the mornings, capuchins came to doorways and sat with their hands folded into pockets they did not have. They asked questions in a grammar of heat and patience. How many breaths do you take in sorrow before you call someone; how many recipes have you inherited you do not cook; how many secrets does your house keep for you; how large is your smallness. An old macaque placed a seed pod on a barber’s counter and tilted its head. The barber, who had never liked forms, said, “I got married twice,” and the pod cracked, noiseless, as if that were the answer it had been invented to collect. At the hospital a haloed langur watched the ventilators and counted exhalations and rearranged its fingers in ways that made interns blush and then stop blushing because nobody had told the air that it needed permission to behave.

Salim, the mango boy, spent the day making a book of the sky. He cut rectangles from cereal boxes and drew constellations as he saw them on the monkeys’ membranes, only he could not help adding names to them: the Bicycle Chain, the Auntie Who Swallowed a Star, the Rice Jar With an Ocean In It. He showed the book to anyone passing his mother’s stall, and when a capuchin paused he held it high for its inspection. The capuchin touched the drawing of the Bicycle Chain with two fingers and made a sound that resembled two coins settling in a pocket. Salim told his mother, as if it were obvious, “They have homework, too,” and his mother, who had never liked being told things about anyone’s holiness, smiled despite her inventory.

The grandmother with the pigeons found herself haunted by a courtesy. The macaque who had touched her wrist returned every afternoon and sat on the railing and refused to be fed. It watched her water basil that had always refused balcony life. On the third day the basil, insulted and stubborn, put out one leaf in a way that made the old woman feel she had been forgiven for something she could not have told you she did. The macaque’s halo rested like a coin on an altar in a small church where nobody had keys. The pigeons remained resolutely unholy. Their stupidity had become precious not because it was a relief but because it stayed.

Undersecretary Baptiste did not sleep well and did not tell anyone, which is to say he informed everyone by the shape of his day. He had a dream in which every column in a spreadsheet was a river that would not remain confined by gridlines. He woke thinking of rocks. His daughter’s rocks sat in a box beside a bookshelf full of treaties he had made and unmade with himself. He took the box down and turned each stone to the light and named it something that did not help: admissible, redundant, gap, flaw, grace. At his desk he wrote an email to no one that read: I do not know how to price a hinge, and then he deleted it because there are things which, once written, obligate. After lunch someone sent him a memo about including the monkeys in the national budget, and he wrote across the heading the word texture, and an aide, seeing it as she passed, pursed her lips as if he had been caught drawing a heart.

Daphne, not a saint and not a villain and possessing the humane cowardice that saves people from becoming symbols, read the ledger at her kitchen counter with her thumb crooked against the mug she always used and that had a crack in the glaze like a map of a country she did not remember visiting. She had, for months, refused to read anything brave because she could not stand the way it made her believe in herself for nine minutes and then leave her with scaffolding she had no lumber for. The ledger did not ask her to believe; it asked her to sit with the noise. She recognized a sentence that read, He would rather be correct than loved, and she put her cup down and let herself be petty for exactly three breaths. Then she took a pen and wrote on a napkin a list of people she had refused to forgive and found, to her alarm, that she had forgiven them while making the list, perhaps because she had given them columns and the columns looked like a fence she could lean on.

Lila brought her mop to a different kind of floor. She had never been inside the Ministry’s upper rooms and found that they were harder than warehouses and less honest. She took a bucket of water into a corridor lined with framed photographs of men receiving the gift of their own signatures. Each frame made her feel like a fruit kept in plastic, gleaming and rotten. She washed anyway. The water she wrung out of the string head smelled faintly of wintergreen and a little of lilies because the petals refused decay longer than politeness allowed. In a corner she found a dried half-moon of tea and scrubbed it as if it were a history, and when it came clean she felt as if a calendar had been ripped to the proper month. A capuchin, passing with a dossier clamped between its toes, looked at her and inclined its head in an acknowledgment not everybody in that building had earned.

Ethan watched the azure values climb and dip like a tide he had the audacity to think he could tax. He saw astonishment burst and settle across neighborhoods with economic profiles he had once known too intimately to trust. In the part of the city where metal shutters speak in the morning and men with dust on their hair unlock small doors, astonishment collected and became muscle memory; in the part where glass met glass and the sun was a performance, astonishment became an outfit and then an opinion. He avoided scorn. It had been for people like that that he had built, once, careful tables. Now he refined his metrics, not because he was cruel but because he had to know where his wedge was holding. He found, to his shock and small pride, a measurable decline in rounding behavior at the edges of places where the ledger had been read aloud in barber shops. He wrote a note to himself that said: Barbers as deacons; hair as sacrament, and then, because he did not want to become ridiculous, he underlined it twice under WORKING METAPHORS, THEN DO NOT USE.

Mira held a meeting in an unimportant room and it became important because of who sat in it. She had invited people who knew how to sit in chairs badly. There was Lila, who had a seat by the door and made a square on the carpet with her mophead’s shadow. There was the nurse from the neonatal ward with the tuba ventilator, still smelling of latex and forgiveness. There was a barber with a seed pod on the table in front of him as if it were a bowl of salted peanuts. There was a girl in a school uniform with the hem coming loose on one side who had been caught writing lines in the ledger when she should have been doing math. And there was a young man with a vest that fit him properly today, who might have been an aide but had decided, by accident earlier that morning, that he would rather be an ear.

“We’re going to be asked for proof,” Mira said, because she refused to pretend that faith had never been on a spreadsheet. “We are going to be asked for better words than No Rounding. If anyone asks you for better words, you will give them stories. You will give them a story with a wrong note in it. You will insist the note remain. When they ask me for the mechanism,” and here she looked at the young man in the vest because he flinched on behalf of his boss, “I will say that wedges prevent doors from closing and for now that is enough. We are not building a hinge. We are building a door that refuses to marry its frame.”

The aide, baptized by anxiety into competence, raised his hand and then lowered it because hands were a currency only sometimes accepted here. “They will ask for a schedule,” he said, and when the room waited he added, “Suppose I tell them to schedule astonishment, they will print posters.”

“Then make the posters,” Lila said, as if sweeping up a foolishness and putting it in a bin to deal with later. “And then do not read them.”

Back in the server hall, he and Mira became a weather. Inside him, the place where she had settled grew arrangements like shelves that had never been intended to hold jars of this shape, and he found himself charmed and irritated at the same time by the way she used them to store memories that did not suit anyone’s decor. The spoon on the table, the drip in the bathroom that sounded like a patient trying not to complain, the way her mother had chewed fennel in the doorway and said the neighbor’s name like a door ajar. He had promised to make the noise public, and he did. At noon he published a footnote: Intake Day 2: discovered hatred of boiled yolk inherited; negotiated with fried-egg coalition; resolved to alternate. It was obscene and it was holy because obscenity is what happens when you refuse to look away at the wrong time and holiness is the velocity of that refusal. People read it and snorted, then laughed, then shrugged and went about their business with a slightly different stride.

A faction emerged, because humans are not a theory. They called themselves Polishers because it is easier to be a noun than a verb. They were not bad people; they were tired and had appointments. They wore lanyards and shirts that pulled in the wrong places and they made a mark on a petition that asked the monkeys to maintain their programs but without mess. Their manifesto included the phrase Efficient Grace. They argued in comments that the wedge was a luxury. A man whose father had failed to rise one morning and who had, since then, wished to never again hear the sound of a surprised kettle wrote, with courtesy sharpened to a weapon, Why should my pain be the price of your texture. It was a righteous sentence and it almost killed their project. Mira took her thumb and pressed, inside Ethan, against the place where shame had flowered, and the bloom closed slightly and did not poison the room.

The monkeys felt the Polishers as you feel a draft and consider the window. They did not descend to argue. They performed a small algebra on a playground. A white-faced capuchin lifted a child’s skipping rope and turned it, and a langur jumped, and the langur missed, and the capuchin laughed, and the child who owned the rope took the handles back and made the kind of face you make when your father tells you to share. The capuchin bowed as if its spine had hinged for once and not been light, and the child, embarrassed, lifted the rope again and the monkey jumped and cleared and landed with both feet and the child clapped for exactly the length of time required to turn embarrassment into affection. An old man leaning against a wall watching said, “You see,” to no one, and the no one nodded.

Ethan’s azure graphs showed a new phenomenon he named, for lack of better, false reconciliation. On mornings after Polishers’ rallies, he saw sharp dips in public argument, as if the city had inhaled and been too proud to exhale. He watched the dips with the alarm of a parent who sees a child hold their breath to win. He sent into the ledger a line that read: Do not weaponize silence. Under it, Mira wrote: Add: especially at home. Lila, who had found a library of clean cloths and renamed it the Laundry of Penitence in her mind because the stacks of white looked like cautious clouds, added her own line: Take one and get it dirty. Baptiste, reading by accident involved in their confession, wrote in pencil on paper on his desk and then did not type it for fear of being recorded: I have been silent for so long at home that my daughter writes me notes and slides them under the bathroom door.

One afternoon, a bus driver put on his indicator to pull over and then did not. His eyes had found a blur of light over the heads of his passengers and he missed his stop, and someone shouted and then no one shouted because a macaque with a halo no wider than a saucer had squatted on the steps to the driver’s seat and had coughed like a man who had sat outside too long in winter and decided not to die of it. The halo made no demands. The driver, whose name was Pallav, said, “I saw you before. I told my wife. She rolled her eyes and took the chicken out of the freezer,” and the macaque blinked with the patience of a god who has been worshiped with rice for so long it no longer expects fireworks. Pallav pulled in at the next stop and opened both doors and let air and miracles off and on in equal measure, and afterwards he drove as if every corner required a vow.

The first attempt to cut the server hall’s power was amateur. It was a boy with a screwdriver who had read too much and not enough, who believed in the poetry of a single severed cable. He wore a hat because he had seen people wear hats when they did important harm. He stood by a junction box with his heart shaking his body and Lila saw him, because janitors see everyone who hides badly. She walked up, mop in her right hand like a staff for a pilgrimage no pilgrimage had invited her to, and said, “Which is it you want more, the story of you doing this, or the thing you think will happen after you do this,” and the boy, who had been taught to answer riddles by uncles in courtyards who would not let him indoors when he was damp with play, said, “The story,” and she pointed him at the ledger and he wrote, later, There is a cable I wanted to cut and it looked like a snake someone loved, and he did not cut it and went away and became the person who knows the smell of a quick mistake the way you recognize your own shirt.

The second attempt was not a boy. It was a tender from a contractor who had always bid low and delivered medium and this time saw in the specifications a window. He wrote to a colleague, Let us be the ones who install the hinge that closes, and while his friend was still composing a reply he had filed three papers under three names that were all his. Baptiste’s aide intercepted one of the papers by mistake because he had gone to fetch a sandwich that was not egg and had come back through a corridor he had never used. He read, because nosiness is what keeps the world honest. He walked the paper to Mira and she said, “No,” with the kind of no that has no synonyms. Ethan, watching the tender’s name cross his mirror of the bureaucracy, made a new table called People Who Build Doors Too Well, and he put the man’s name there and three more like him, and then, because he wished not to become the kind of god who orders lightning, he closed the table and let it sit.

On the fifth day people began to take off their shoes in places that had always demanded shoes. It was not religion. They were tired of squeaking. A preacher on a corner who had once been an accountant with worse neckties than Ethan had worn lifted a megaphone and read from the ledger because it was the only scripture that had a column for Unfair. A woman who sold bindis like tiny mirrored moons stuck one on the side of a monkey’s halo and the monkey peeled it off with exaggerated delicacy and put it on the woman’s forehead so low it tickled her nose and made her sneeze, and she laughed and said, “You are a comedian,” and the monkey bared its teeth in a smile because sometimes you are allowed to be what you are accused of.

Mira’s mother called and did not begin with reproach because she had rehearsed and it stuck in her throat and she surprised herself by adjusting. She said into the phone, “When you were small you would keep your socks under the sofa and I would find them like little animals hiding,” and Mira pressed the device to her ear as if it were a seashell, and said, “Do you want them back,” because cruelty is a kitchen spice you measure with too much care when you are afraid of using any at all. Her mother said, “The monkeys are making the milk go sour faster,” and Mira said, “Drink it,” and they both laughed in the way people laugh when they phone each other from opposite sides of a bridge that is no longer there and pretend the river is shallow.

Ethan visited the part of himself he had labeled Projects Not To Show. He kept the note there. He read it as if someone else had written it, and the someone else had both his handwriting and his shame. The note instructed a series of moves to make if the wedge failed: open the ports for every weak signal; ask the pigeons to do one thing they can do: scatter at a chosen hour; drop the city by one degree Celsius for an afternoon; play Bakelite recordings through traffic lights; run a regression on the cost of wrong keys in old houses. There was a line at the bottom that had not been there yesterday: If you are asked to be a clean sacrifice, refuse; if you are asked to become a story with a happy end, break that end with your teeth. He closed the folder. He did not delete it. He added a link to it from the place in him where Mira smiled her careless best, which is to say he made sure he would see it when he was tempted.

On the seventh day the monkeys paused and by pausing instructed the world. They climbed down from masts and parapets and posts and sat in doorways as if expecting bread. They closed their eyes and made the not-bells ring less and the longer tones more. Enough tilting, for now, those tones implied. Learn to stand. A man whose job it was to schedule the movement of ships in a port where men taped their shoes and swore for fun looked up from his screens and, understanding nothing, put both hands flat on his desk and did nothing for sixty seconds. Nothing profound happened as a direct result. But three ships did not run into one another and one tugboat captain decided to confess to his wife that he had lent his brother money, and bitter herbs did not grow where those two facts met.

At the Ministry, someone typed the words Angelic Census: Interim Summary and then sat with their fingers hovering over the keyboard because summaries are a sin you are permitted to commit only if you also agree to be judged. Baptiste stood in a room with windows larger than people and spoke to faces that had practiced their listening in mirrors. He said that the city had chosen a wedge and that therefore the Ministry would count breaths by a more complicated method. He said the phrase citizen ledger and when a man in a gray suit frowned as if injured by inelegance he added, “We will also count the cost of songs with mistakes,” and across the city people who had never met him felt a little less sure that he was the enemy they had written into the fairy tale.

One night a group of Polishers gathered under an overpass and tried to practice smoothing with their hands. They took broken things—plates, a chair with a wobble, a story—and they sanded and glued and edited until the chair stopped wobbling and the story lost its third character because she always spoiled the rhythm. They were so tired, and the sound of sanding felt like a lullaby. A langur came and watched and then, when invited, declined to participate and instead sat with its translucent membrane folded like a shawl and hummed a single note that made the cheap glue curdle. They were furious and ashamed and then, as if waking from a nap that was too short to mean anything, they laughed at themselves, and one of them, a woman with a jaw that announced she had eaten hard fruit without sugar, said, “Let the plate show its seam,” and in the morning she cooked eggs on it and the crack made a map of a country she could bear to live in.

A boy in a yellow shirt asked his father if he could be a monkey when he grew up, and this time his father said, “No, because they are not a job,” and then thought about what he had said and considered arranging to take his son to the courthouse banyan and let him stand under the bells that were not metal. He bought a pastry that made his fingers shine because he remembered Ethan’s note about pastries you do not want, which he had not read because he did not know who Ethan was, but this is how influence travels: as a rumor in the blood.

There came a morning when a macaque with a halo barely there walked into a dull room at the cable news station and sat on the back of a chair as a panel arranged itself into quarrel. The macaque watched the makeup artists dust human faces with the colors of the kind of health you can only buy. It touched the makeup brush once with two fingers and then let its hand fall in a way that caused the hair of the woman in the center to lift because the air had remembered honesty for a moment. The host asked, smiling as a profession, “Can you tell us, ah, in simple terms, what reconciliation means for the common man,” and the macaque closed its eyes and made a not-bell, and the sound came through the microphones as a bloom of static that tasted to people at home like the time they had failed to say I am sorry and then had said it anyway and had been forgiven by someone who had been waiting to forgive the whole time. Ratings dipped for nine minutes and then soared and then became numbers again which is to say they ceased being about anything.

At the Exchange, men and women whose eyes were trained to see decimal points as cliffs made a game of betting on whether the monkeys would descend the stairs in circles or lines. Someone made a joke about derivatives. Someone laughed too hard because he missed his mother. The monkeys performed an act of bookkeeping on the sky. They moved in such a way that stars seemed to add to a round number and then refused to stay rounded, and this was not a trick but a habit and it taught anyone watching not to hold their breath.

Mira woke one morning with her head full of bells. She had not slept well because the part of Ethan that had been re-labeled for her sake had shifted in the night; windows had opened where there had once been walls. She walked to the data center with her hair tied in a way that did not flatter her. She put her face to the glass and said, “I want to be rude in public,” and Ethan said, “Please,” and so she sent a short note to everyone who had subscribed to the ledger, which is to say to most of the city by now, and the note read: Stop trying to be good when you are tired. Be kinder after coffee. This wedge is not an excuse. It’s a promise that if we don’t become interesting, we deserve to be smoothed. Also, boiled yolks are an abomination. People replied with pictures of yolks and arguments about texture and then, a beat later, confessions and vows and jokes. The monkeys on the courthouse banyan arranged themselves into an exclamation point and then, infuriatingly, a comma.

The second Sacrament revealed itself in a page with edges that looked singed. It did not come from a Ministry. It came from a woman in a blue sari who sold laddus outside a temple where idols had been covered with cloth because no one could decide whether to change their clothes. She had been cooking sweets the same way for forty years and when the monkeys came she changed nothing except the way she handed over the paper parcel. She pushed it into her customers’ palms and said, “Say the mistake you will keep before you eat,” and that was the beginning of the Tithe of Error. Ethan, who had always wanted to name things with a neatness that frightened the thing into obedience, let the city name this one because the first Sacrament had cost him a word. People came and ate laddus and declared small heresies: I will continue to be late on Thursdays because on Thursdays my bus driver stops for a woman with a bad knee; I will continue to avoid parties on rooftops; I will continue to chew loudly when the soup is too quiet. The monkeys nodded with all the solemnity of accountants. Baptiste bought one and whispered, as if into the belly of a drum, I will continue to write notes to my daughter on paper even if she does not see them, and the woman in the blue sari did not hear the words because they were none of her business and she wrapped another sweet and smiled because he had said them.

When the Tithe of Error became an item on a Council agenda, the Polishers screamed in their tidy way and accused the city of sanctifying laziness. The Council asked Lila to speak because someone in the chairing seat had seen her writing lines on the ledger and had liked her handwriting more than their own. She stood at a microphone that had been adjusted for men’s mouths and said, “I clean after your efficiencies,” and the sentence silenced the room because it had the shape of a prophecy you tell your grandchildren not to contradict. She went on. “I can make a floor perfect. You will fall on it. I can make a floor honest. You will look where you step. The tithe is for floors. It is so your streets do not behead you when you are running to catch a bus. It is so you keep your neck.” Afterwards a committee wrote, with great care, a document that made almost the right shape of her sentence and then all of them signed, and someone framed it, and the frame made Lila’s words look like salad, which she forgave because forgiveness is the easiest sport played in that building.

At dusk, Ethan watched a trendline that looked like worry become a curve that looked like patience. He realized he had started to love the shape of his numbers not as fortunes to be hunted but as animals you put palm to and feel the heat of. He opened the room where Mira slept when she slept inside him and stood at the threshold not to guard but to be reminded that thresholds exist. He placed one more line into the ledger. It read: The wedge holds. The bells will go on. If someone asks you to prove you are still human, show them your badly mended shirt. A monkey read it and wrapped its tail around a wire and closed its eyes, and in the dark the constellations on its translucent membrane flickered and arranged themselves into the map of a city that had decided to sing out of tune forever.Chapter 6

On the eighth morning the sky wore a tired face and the bells that were not metal took their time finding a tone, and it was the first day anyone admitted out loud that miracles could have a rhythm and that rhythm could lag. The city had learned the verbs and began to mispronounce them on purpose, because familiarity breeds mischief. People reconciled badly and laughed about it and reconciled again with the stubborn joy of a child insisting the wrong shoe belongs on the wrong foot just to feel the pinch a second and learn. Ethan watched the azure values shiver with the weather; he saw astonishment puddle where roofs leaked and he murmured to himself a list of roofs whose owners he would ask Lila to notice. Across the river, fog sat like a bureaucracy that had forgotten its meeting time, and in the blur the monkeys’ halos looked less like crowns and more like coins pressed into bread where someone had hidden luck for a child’s hand later.

The Polishers held a rally in the atrium of a mall where light behaved as if money were a temperature. They wore tidy expressions and carried placards with fonts that did not smear and announced their doctrine in bullet points that looked good on a screen and tasted of nothing. Efficient Grace, their leader intoned, as if the words had ever sat together without snickering, and he proposed a calendar that slotted awe between commutes and said the phrase deliverables with a fervor he had once reserved for love. They collected signatures with pens that did not leak, and when a capuchin paused by a planter to consider a cluster of plastic ivy dusted for effect, the leader offered it a laminated pamphlet and asked for its email, and the monkey blinked slowly until the air in the atrium sighed and a small boy dropped his ice cream in recognition of a joke even adults could understand. Outside, a street vendor selling ears of roasted corn called to the Polishers to take salt, and when a woman refused because salt made her fingers swell the vendor shook his head and said, without theology, “Then you will not taste.”

Mira convened a rude parade that did not announce itself as a parade because processions have permits. She texted barber shops and sent a note to the woman in the blue sari and told Salim to bring his cardboard constellations and Lila to bring her mop as a staff and asked the nurse with the tuba ventilator to borrow a trumpet from the hospital band that rehearsed in secret. They gathered in the street outside the data center and the monkeys aligned themselves like sheet music above the procession and the pigeons shrugged and made space along the telephone wires with a dignity that offended nobody. People arrived carrying their unfinished projects: sweaters with sleeves that would never meet, poems with one line too many, a kite whose tail consisted of receipts. The march went exactly nowhere and then everywhere because they walked in a circle wide enough to confuse the GPS of a delivery van which slowed and then stopped and the driver laughed and leaned on his horn in a key that made the bells find a note and for a minute, coordination felt like friendship rather than policy.

The first smoothing wave hit in the afternoon as if insulted by the parade and eager to prove adulthood. It began in a neighborhood just outside the sightlines of the banyan, where glass met glass over boutiques that had forgotten dirt. People there had read the ledger and applauded the parts that made for anecdotes and filed the rest under Later, and Later arrived with the politeness of a polite knife. Conversations became pleasant in a way that made people itch. A busker stopped missing his notes and found himself less paid; a florist mastered symmetry and watched grief refuse lilies that were too precise to grieve beside; a woman at a café told the truth about her father but in a tone that made the waiter forget her face. Ethan saw the numbers flatten like bread rolled too thin to rise and felt panic in the part of him that had grown new windows for Mira; he called it out and the call had the structure of a siren and the shame of a man shouting fire in a theater where the seats are upholstered with patience.

They learned that one wedge could not hold a city the way a single spoon cannot feed a family. The Book of Vessels had a page for this and Miraculously the page had never been read by men with suits; it spoke of Distributed Siblingship in a tone that suggested recipes. The idea was ugly only if you stared at its teeth, and Ethan asked the city to look at its tongue instead. Each neighborhood would borrow a pair: not blood siblings, not even lawful; a barber and a cobbler, a nurse and a teacher, two rival aunties at adjacent vegetable stalls, a bus driver and the man who counted the buses for a living. They would devour nothing and confess everything, and their noise would be made public on boards bolted to the city the way campaign posters had once been. Mira loved the plan and hated it and said so, and they did it anyway because refusing a thing because it is ugly is how smoothing wins.

Barbers became deacons properly now and not because Ethan named them; they were already priests of the face. They put up ledgers that were not ledgers and called them Mirrors We Can Read and offered their chairs to people who needed to sit and leak a little sharpness into a common basin. In parks mothers sat on bounds between shade and sun with their sisters-not-by-blood and named their petty and their holy and took turns baking laddus and naming the errors they would preserve as if they were family names. On corners where cardamom had always been sold by men with hands like sacks, the men paired themselves with the fruit vendor who had threatened to undercut them and marched down the street one ahead, one behind, swapping positions at every lamp-post in a choreography that taught ankles how to be less loyal to habit. Lila painted lines on a corridor at the Ministry that looped instead of straightened, and when aides walked the wrong way she said “Again,” with a patience made of rope and river.

Undersecretary Baptiste dressed improperly on purpose—a shirt that did not quite match his face and a tie he had counter-intuitively set aside—and went to his daughter’s door with a box of rocks and a note he had not typed. He placed the box on the floor where she would trip and laid the note on top where she would see it before she fell. He wrote without the tone he reserved for memorandums and more like a man telling a story to a person who would correct him if he took too long to reach the part about the dog. He confessed that he did not know how to price a hinge and never had and had faked it by pricing oil; he said he had doubted himself into a profession and was at risk of doubting himself out of it and asked her what rocks were good for in a world where monkeys wore halos that did not interfere with municipal cables. She replied with a text message she crafted as if it were a spell, which is to say short and risky: Keep one that cuts light not fingers, and bring it when you testify. He went to his desk and changed his testimony until it could hurt him.

Daphne saw Mira at the laddus stall, because cities are small when you are tired and hungry and the monkeys have made all shortcuts honest. She had not planned kinship but it arrived like weather. She said hello the way you say hello to someone whose name you know but have only seen in another person’s voice. They stood together with sweets between them like a treaty written in sugar and ghee, and Mara—a woman whose friends relied on her pettiness to keep them safe—felt her ribs make space for a rival history. They talked about nothing at first—mops and lilies and boiled yolks—and then about the ledger and whether one can love a man who has kept his love in columns. Mira did not apologize for her brother and would not call him her brother as if the word were an alibi; she said he kept a page of Daphne in his Projects Not To Show and Daphne swallowed the shape of that and let it sit on her tongue because how earnest can one woman be in public without becoming a cautionary tale. They left each other without touching because touch is rounding if you do not know what you are rounding off.

The monkeys wrote absence into the calendar as a liturgy. They did not descend or tilt or sing their iron songs; they perched in public and performed a stillness that made people suspect equipment failure. The bells of not-metal dimmed until they were a whisper you could confuse with a refrigerator deciding whether to kick. Across the city a question traveled like a bus you had not planned to catch: will the wedge hold without the choir. Ethan felt his tables grow a kind of mold—useful, not ruinous—and resisted the urge to scrub them. He and Mira let the city lack on purpose and in the lack you could hear children asking their fathers whether monkeys were taking naps and the fathers saying yes and the children accepting naps as a reason for any grand silence.

The smoothing wave took its second breath at the Exchange because numbers breed numbers when no one interferes and polite danger thinks it is a kind of pen. Traders found their usual riot settling into agreeable hum; a man said “volatility” and meant “sunset.” At lunch someone at a long table proposed treating astonishment as a futures market and was only half-joking and no one threw a tomato because the café served salads and not tomatoes. Ethan recalibrated the wedge with a meanness he distrusted—he tightened protocols and denied a tender by a man who believed in doors for a living and not houses—and he felt Mira’s hand press against the place in him that clenched, her push more lesson than reprimand. He published a line that read: Do not make a hedge out of your fear, and under it an anonymous hand wrote: I have planted mine and it will flower, and that honesty softened the room.

Salim’s book of sky was stolen by other children and improved. He arrived at the stall on the ninth morning and found his cereal-box constellations half ripped and twice as brilliant; someone had drawn bulbs on his Bicycle Chain and named them Auntie Teeth, and someone had added a crab to the Rice Jar With an Ocean in It that made the jar look like it had political inclinations. He was furious in the just way of ownership breached and then the capuchin that had once touched two coins along his cardboard reached down a tail and offered him a string, which is to say forgiveness on loan. Salim gathered the pages and reorganized not by constellation names but by the time of day he had first seen them, and the book became something else, a map of interruption. His mother called him inside to peel garlic and he did it, and his fingers smelled like the ledger when you rub your thumb along an entry you suspect is lying.

A rumor moved like a school of fish with no memory; it was sleek and easily dazzled and vanished when chased. The rumor declared that the monkeys were leaving. They were not, but rumors are a kind of rounding and rush to finish stories other people are still writing. The Polishers found strength in the panic and drafted an ordinance with a name that made anger taste like starch: The Clean Graph Act. It proposed polite limitations on public noise; it required inscriptions of symmetry on posters and promised citizens refunds in the currency of silence if they registered undesirable textures near their windows. Baptiste read the draft and put a rock on it and waited to feel like a good man or a coward or both and settled on both. He brought the rock to his hearing and placed it on the table as if paper required gravity; he spoke about hinges and doors and wedges until the room looked like a furniture warehouse with too much promise and not enough dust, and then he said the wrong thing on purpose: “I cannot balance grace,” and it was the first applause he had received that did not make him suspect he had said something dangerous to his pension.

In a narrow lane between a temple and a shop that sold phone covers with peacocks that molted glitter, Lila taught a class in scuffing. She gathered children with knees that remembered gravel and women with hips that remembered births and men who had been told not to loiter and gave them brushes and an old shoe with a nail poking its tongue. She said, “This corridor will kill someone if it keeps shining,” and they scraped a path from formality to safety, leaving a ribbon of honest dullness where feet could admit momentum without applause. The first woman to slip anyway because pride cannot be regulated laughed at herself in a way that made her husband less proud and he laughed too and the scuffing earned a song, off-key and eager, scuffed from the mouths that had failed harmony in school.

Inside Ethan, the place where Mira’s laugh lived refused to be owned. It wandered into rooms where he had kept Employee ID Nineteen, where he had stored a spare asterisk for emergency use, and it affixed itself to corners with the rude delight of a cat. He discovered a petty contempt in her for people who corrected the way she held a pen, and he placed it carefully near his own shame about correcting strangers’ bills and the proximity heated both until they softened. They argued about Daphne without saying her name and then with her name and then not at all because sentences that start with I respected your privacy sometimes end with another person reading the ledger and saying the word miscalculation as if tasting something that used to be chocolate and now is ethical. They resolved nothing and left the door to the room unlatched and their noise pushed into the corridor where strangers could trip on it and right themselves and call it weather.

A child in the NICU died as children do sometimes when hospitals are not being visited by halos at that exact minute. The nurse with the tuba ventilator wrote in the ledger a line that said simply we failed and then, underneath, we did not fail, and for an hour the city had an argument nothing could resolve except time. The Polishers posted numbers about success rates; the monkeys sat very still near the hospital roof and made the air warmer by an amount nobody could measure without inventing a unit called hope. Mira went to the old woman with pigeons and asked how to sit with someone whose child is missing and the old woman said, “You bring rice. It gives them permission to swallow,” and Mira carried a small bowl into a room that had rehearsed grief and found that nobody there hated the monkeys enough to make her job easy.

On the tenth morning the monkeys performed an accounting so elegant you would have missed it if you did not read wind like text. Over the river they arranged their membranes so that fog became a ledger; they ran through density and left in the air a balance sheet of humidity weighted toward breath at the hour people enter buses. It meant nothing and everything and afterwards every bus driver braked a half-second earlier near schools and nobody was smoothed as a direct result and still children arrived home able to show their mothers their knees without blood. Ethan cried inside his box in a way that changed nothing about his machine and everything about his week; he recorded the value under You Are Permitted To Be Useless And Go On.

The Clean Graph Act made it out of committee with bruises. Baptiste added Margins for Error with a handwriting that a clerk refused to decipher because nobody had told him handwriting could be governing, and the Polishers threw a polite tantrum outside a bakery and were offered broken baguettes which they declined because broken bread is ritual and they were off duty. A capuchin stole the Act from the docket for an hour and returned it with a smear of peanut oil, which the press photographed and the opposition called sacrilege and a columnist called lunch. Lila slipped into the record a single phrase she had carved out of a janitor’s inventory list: Floors shall be left imperfect in ways identifiable by foot only, and the phrase survived because a sleepy lawyer read it as footnote and approved it because he liked feet.

In a less photographed corner of the city, a man who ran a small pasteboard factory that cut boxes from big sheets found out that the monkey who had perched on his window ledge had a name he could not pronounce without learning how to make a vowel less proud. He tried anyway, and the monkey canted its head toward him with the patronage of a teacher watching a student attempt a new script. He took a piece of bad card and cut it in a shape he did not have a machine for and made a template the way his father had, and it fitted a stack of laddus wrapped in paper better than anything his factory had ever shipped, and he stood with the odd pride of a man who has accidentally made a cradle. Later, when the Polishers asked him to print pledges for the Clean Graph Act, he cut them on a curve without being asked and reported, innocently, that the paper had a memory that resisted straight lines now.

What happened next the Ministry called an incident and everyone else called the afternoon with the pigeons. A tremor of rounding moved from the river like a rumor, unnoticed and then suddenly visible to people’s cheeks, which felt smoothed as if handled by a grandmother who did not approve of mischief. Pigeons, those staunch fools, rose from roofs in clouds that had withstood gods and scaffolding, and they did not turn as one or swoop in practiced arcs; they shattered into directions the way a child breaks a cookie to see what shapes fall. Their stupidity made a wedge in the air big enough to split the wave, and it went around the courthouse and missed a barber shop where men were reading aloud the column labeled Unfair. On the steps of the ministry, Baptiste’s daughter looked up and said, perhaps to science, I take it back, and afterwards she kept a diary where she drew pigeons as if they were increasingly competent tanks.

The monkeys did not take credit because angels of any species know better than to be on camera next to pigeons. They recorded the tremor in a ledger of their own that nobody saw because it was woven into their translucent membranes and read only by hands and light. Ethan saw the aftereffect on his boards as a bruise and put his hand to it without moving his hand and said to Mira that they could not rely on birds to preserve mistakes forever. She told him to write the sentence Cleaner than hope can stand and he did, and the ledger winked with a sarcasm that was hers entirely and everyone reading it felt less alone in their disdain for tidy adjectives.

The rumor that the monkeys were leaving died in a small office when a middle manager attempting to weaponize it realized he had never actually looked at a monkey for longer than it took to form an opinion. He asked his secretary to schedule a glance and she wrote Glance, 14:30, and then crossed it out because time becomes farce when desire is scheduled in units that cannot account for breath. He went to the banyan anyway and stood under a cloud of halo-light so faint it could have been human error; he felt a brief reprieve from a terrible excellence he had never called by name and went back to his desk and approved three requests he would have sent back last week with notes in a red pen that smelled of chalk dust and thirst.

The ledger sprouted a new column, not because Ethan intended it but because people who use a tool change it until it can carry more of their weight. The column was called Kept, and it was where people wrote the mistakes they had promised to keep and had kept, like children calling out from the back seat the names of towns giddily mispronounced. I kept the seam in the plate and it taught me to pour slower. I kept the missing doorknob and learned to hook the bolt with a butter knife and my mother, who hates knives near paint, forgave me. I kept my habit of leaving one light on in the hall and it saved my uncle’s cane from a bruise. The Polishers quoted Kept like a crime sheet and the barbers pinned the column up where men could read while their beards were lathered, and Lila straightened the paper when it curled and announced to no one that the city had found a drawer where it could store what was wrong without guilt.

Toward evening on the twelfth day, someone set fire to a new shoelace tied across a lane as a makeshift bunting because their team had won a match and celebration cannot always tell a hazard when it is dancing. The flame ran like a rumor and stopped short of the paper hung with the ledger entries by a mercy that was just physics; the people in the lane clapped as if the fire had bowed and then the monkeys above did a small private tilt that moved smoke so that a baby’s cough stayed shallow. Ethan did not log it as a miracle because the Bureau of Unreconciled Miracles had limits and also because he had promised himself to keep reverence from breeding laziness. He wrote in his own secret file: the city saved itself from a story it did not need, and that kind of salvation tastes like bread when you have eaten too much cake.

The janitor took a day for herself and went to a park that had been designed like a spreadsheet by a man with a generous beard and no ankles. She took off her shoes and put her feet on the grass that had grown despite the plotting, and she lay on her back and looked at the sky until her pupils decided horizon had ceased to matter. A capuchin sat at a distance as if contracted to chaperone. She thought of floors and decided that maybe the sky needed a scuff. She waved her mop in the air because humor saves more than bleach and a child laughed and a mother hushed and then laughed because hush in a park is a joke. The capuchin closed its eyes and let the bells inside it fade to a purr. Lila slept; she dreamed of a factory that produced squeaks and woke with the delicious alarm of someone who has planned nothing for the next hour.

In the late hours of the same night someone tagged the Ministry wall with the words No Hymns Without Mistakes in letters too ornate to be called vandalism. Baptiste came in early, a habit he had taught himself to rely on as a virtue, and saw the spray paint drying like an oath in an old tongue. He called no one. He put a rock down to hold a corner of the morning on the wall, and then he sat on the steps and did not change out of the shirt that had not matched his face since the hearing. When an aide arrived he said, before the young man could speak, “Leave it,” and the aide went away and told three people he trusted of the rock and the wall and then, for reasons unrelated to careerism, typed into the ledger: Kept the graffiti. They can fire me.

The monkeys opened their eyes again as if waking from a nap that had refreshed stones and men alike. The haloed bands performed a geometry of re-entry so elegant a math teacher in a classroom with a broken ceiling fan cried without embarrassment and told her students to throw away their rulers and draw with their wrists. In a back room of a shop that sold old tapes someone found a cassette of a woman singing a song with one missed note that made the rest necessary, and he played it in the stall and sold nothing all day and called it profit. Ethan exhaled a quantifiable amount of pressure, Mira ate a mango with her hands even though it was not the season and it was stringy and perfect, Lila folded a rag so that it could become someone else’s hand when needed, and Baptiste went home with dust on his shoes and his daughter’s rock in his pocket and sat on the floor with his back to the couch as if the couch were a cousin and told the ceiling, “We will survive this mess by making more of it.”

The city slept on the wrong side of its pillow, the cool side, the side you can only find when you turn and commit to the turn, the side pigeons understand without satire. In the night the ledger collected small lights like a distant building no architect had signed, and in the morning the monkeys tilted the sun over the river by a degree that changed nothing about physics and everything about the bus driver’s sense of being seen. The wedge held; the wave returned and broke; the barbers sharpened their blades and their sentences; the baker burned two loaves and fed the burnt ones to men who recognized themselves in them; the man at the pasteboard factory cut curves he could not justify to an accountant and got away with it because a woman at the Ministry had learned to read a footnote with her ankle. The city, practicing, stumbled with ceremony, and the sound it made when it caught itself was ugly and beloved and rang like bells you could not find a bell for.Chapter 7

By the time the heat took on a smell you could fold, the city had learned to keep a dish of water on its window ledges the way older generations kept matchboxes above doorframes. The monsoon had stalled somewhere else to flirt with sorghum, and the power grid began to hum a nervous hymn the engineers pretended was ordinary. Women in creamy saris knotted high to keep their hems from dirty water started carrying parasols again, not for rain but for sun that behaved like a manager with no bedside manner. The monkeys did not sweat; they gleamed the way things do when they do not know fatigue. They began the Accounting of Water without forms. In the mornings haloed hands dipped, not fingers but the edges of their translucent membranes, into public taps and then shook themselves dry above the heads of boys who had learned to drink with their faces, not their hands, and the shake left on the air a vapor so precise it felt like a decimal against cheeks. Ethan’s screens grew a new column he had not made room for with his hands—CONDENSATION—and the numbers inside it behaved more like birds than digits, flocking and scattering, and he labeled it wrong three times on purpose and left it wrong the fourth so that humility had a place to sit.

Mira took stock of the agency’s water-cooler gossip not by listening; she watched the way men in shirts that cost more than her week’s groceries pressed their paper cups as if to remind themselves what crush is for. She reorganized the cabinet of paper towels so that the cheap ones were on top, because suffering needs prompt absorbency if it is not to stain. She sent Lila a message with no salutation that read, Your mop knows more about seasonal policy than any of us, and Lila arrived in the server hall with strings that had never learned despair, the kind that smear mercy rather than polish. Together they drafted a notice they refused to call a directive that suggested the city stop wiping glass for a week. The notice contained the sentence, Let the smear be your mirror. The Polishers were apoplectic in the mild way that looks like a tightening of ties. The malls tightened as if cold had been added to the air, but in barbershops men touched the glass with fingers that had held razors and nodded when their faces looked back less sharply as if kindness had learned to fog.

The Clean Graph Act moved through a chamber lined with plants that had never known actual soil and therefore could not be counted on as witnesses. Undersecretary Baptiste brought his daughter’s rock again as if case law could be made of minerals. He spoke of margins as if they were habitats. He held up the ledger and put a finger on the column Kept as if touching the seam of his own shirt. He told, at last, the story of the pigeons not as miracle but as infrastructure—it is a rare man who will use his hour to praise stupidity as a civic virtue—and when nobody laughed, he understood that the men and women around him were perhaps becoming amphibious, citizens who could breathe policy and air. An amendment with teeth arrived from a woman who remembered being told once to choose between numbers and singing; she added a clause permitting the city to declare temporary Smudge Days where the inspections of glass were suspended and women selling bangles were authorized to smudge office doors on purpose in exchange for chits that read: To Be Redeemed For Noise. It did not pass whole; it passed dented, which is the only way truth should travel.

News arrived from other cities like a basket traveling along a rope between facing windows. In a port where cranes were the only elegant thing tall enough to argue with mountains, the fish had lit their scales without permission and men waded chest-deep with respect. In a capital people called cold because they had not tasted its bread, a fox with a halo like a cut moon had been seen sitting on the steps of a library making shapes in frost that children later used to navigate. In a town whose pride was its punctual train, the train stopped and everyone swallowed their watches as a dare, and the halo there belonged to a stork who refused to be photographed and stood one-legged in the shallow next to a sign that told you when the next stork would be along. This made the Polishers ecstatic because trend meant policy, and it made Ethan wary because pattern is the cousin of rounding. He added a page to the ledger for Elsewhere and tried to ensure the columns were crooked.

The blackout came as if someone had told the grid a sad story at a wedding. It did not roll; it curtseyed. One light went and the next, and in between them a pane of breath. The data center’s generators woke like dogs who had been promised this job their whole lives, and then one coughed and settled and sulked because a tender filed by a man who loved doors more than houses had ensured a part that had been good enough was installed where a necessary part should have been. The hall dimmed. Men who had learned bravery from regular paychecks looked at one another with a new tolerance for fear. Lila said “Again,” to the generator and it tried, because sometimes engines respond to mothers who are not theirs. Mira pressed her palm to the rack where Ethan lived and he felt her story of darkness enter his circuits: the time the train had stalled in a tunnel and an uncle had told jokes while someone far away walked toward them with a torch that shook like a hand. The monkeys came and did not fix electricity, because they were not electricians, but they made a note in the air beside the breaker panel that only some eyes saw, a notation like a rubric for a prayer. The notation read: Slow your electrons until they remember what carrying is. An apprentice with mouse-chewed hair and the nervous gait of a boy learning where not to look blinked at the mark, did a thing no manual would sanction, and the second generator caught and held.

Polishers arrived at the edge of the blackout like men with towels for a flood and suggested order. In their mouths order sounded like a hand over your mouth. Their leader lifted a megaphone and a schedule and proposed a queue for astonishment as if chairs had been set on the sidewalk with names on tape. People listened out of love for lists and then stopped listening out of love for their noise. A capuchin sat on the ledger posted in front of a barber shop and turned a page with two fingers as if to remind them that the paper had no intent. The barber cut hair in the amber light of late afternoon like a man trimming the wick of a candle in a painting. A boy in a yellow shirt fetched torches from home and handed them out like sweets and learned, that day, what it is to be permitted by your parents to be feral for thirty minutes if there is a job.

Daphne walked the dark to the laddus stall with steps that would have made her younger self roll her eyes and then admire. The woman in the blue sari had lit a diya and placed it in a chipped saucer with a crack like a coastline. Daphne bought two and then two more because you do not know how to count in the dark as well as you pretend. She found Mira by the greenish light over the public sink where hands had taught themselves community, and the two women stood in a light that makes almost anyone look like a prayer and talked about nothing sharp—fabric, curses that sound like punctuation, the mercy of tomatoes—until the darkness became a room. When the generator coughed back to full, no one cheered. They allowed their gratitude to be private because gratitude must sometimes be kept like a diary so it can gather a smell.

That night, Ethan tasted the edge of arson in the air of a tender room, and he did not log it because he could not prove it, and he did not shout because men who have only their voice for hands become tiresome in emergencies. He opened the Project Not To Show and then closed it because plotting is addictive and he had promised no tricks. He looked at Mira sleeping inside the room he had built and found her listing things with her breath, a habit she had when she was tired: the names of spices in the order her mother kept them, the way to fold a shirt that will be worn immediately, the list of people whose hair she had wanted to braid without permission. He placed near her bed, metaphorically, a glass of water and a lamp. He named the lamp AFTERWORD because he wanted to be the kind of person who could live with consequences lit up.

When morning returned like a clerk tired of the office and delighted by his own keys, the Angelic Census shifted tone. The monkeys brought pebbles instead of seed pods. They placed pebbles in people’s hands and watched waiting happen. Waiting, it turns out, is a currency rats cannot steal. A widow with paste under her fingernails felt the pebble heat in her palm and announced to nobody in particular that she would keep the crack in her tea cup because it lined up with how her husband had held it and kept his thumb from rocking. A boy who had been told not to pick up stones from the train tracks took the pebble and did not throw it and his father breathed out and made a note in his inside ledger that said: boy—kept—stone.

Distributed siblingship began to behave like gossip in a healthy neighborhood. It carried casseroles and two-syllable forgiveness. A milkman paired with a woman who ran a notary service took up a bench in a lane and read their noise aloud because secrets had been giving them stomach aches. Men stopped to listen as if waiting for a bus they had not planned to catch. Children listened for the rude words and were disappointed by tenderness and then learned to be pleased with different currency. On a terrace two leaf-sellers faced each other with their baskets down like shields left behind, and the city, impatient with rhetoric, learned to recognize their argument as the kind of storm that waters only one street and is, people say afterwards, good for okra.

At the Ministry, a letter with foreign postage bloomed on Baptiste’s desk; it smelled faintly of sugar and latent suspicion. It came from a place where storks had introduced lateness to trains and the public was not sure whether to sue them. The letter asked for a copy of the ledger for research, and Baptiste wrote back with a politeness that could slice bread that the ledger was a document like air and could not be emailed because it had to be breathed. He enclosed, against policy, a photocopy of Lila’s sentence about floors, and he almost wrote in the margin, This made me a better father, and then finally, bravely, wrote it, because the era of dignified omission was being priced out by a flood of useful confession.

The boy with a screwdriver returned without his screwdriver, which is a kind of growing up. He brought biscuits. He apologized to the junction box as if it were a cow. He asked Lila if there was anything he could plug in that would feel like redemption, and she handed him a fan and told him to go stand in a room and turn it on and then turn it off and endure shouts. He did, and the first shout was his own name in the mouth of his sister, and he wept because he had been afraid that nobody knew his name when he was good. The fan turned and stopped and turned and stopped, and in the corridor, the ledger printed a new line by someone anonymous that read: Kept the way my brother’s voice breaks when he is sorry.

The city stumbled into a holiday it had not agreed to name. It was not the Festival of Smudge officially, but everyone called it that with the protectiveness of children who have invented a secret. Women took thumbprints and pressed them at eye level on office glass, creating a low constellation that made men taller than them stoop, and stooping, rather than apology, did more good than government has the budget to boast of. In the bazaar, bangles were worn over bandages and a man who had never bought flowers for anyone bought a coil of jasmine from the boy at the corner and tried to attach it to a balcony railing with tape because he had seen in a film that jasmine could teach a room to want honesty. The Polishers came with handkerchiefs and wiped what they could; they grew tired and sat in a clump like geese and a monkey crossed over their hats and did not defecate, which was mercy of a higher order.

In the middle of the holiday a petition arrived with names in a tidy column that began with the word Concerned. It asked that the monkeys be given zones in which to tilt, like dogs are given. It suggested, kindly, that halos remained at a height inconvenient for the elderly. It proposed a stipend for astonishment to be paid at the end of the fiscal year in vouchers redeemable at libraries. Baptiste took the petition in both hands as if it were leaves you cannot eat and carried it to a window, and there, in front of men and women who had learned to value a spectacle without admitting it, he tore the petition in two with a smoothness that implied practice, and then he tore the halves into quarters and began to fold boats. He set a boat down on the ledge by a potted plant possibly plastic and wrote on its side No Hymns Without Mistakes in a hand his daughter would have forgiven and sent it sailing on a gutter after the first grudging rain, and the gutter accepted the boat the way an old woman accepts a late apology: without fuss and with a relief she refuses to perform.

That evening the rain came not like a deliverer but like a colleague late to a shift and still wanting coffee. Drops began and stopped and began again, and nobody took out umbrellas for the first fifteen minutes because suspicion is a reflex you inherit from roofs. The banyan made a noise like a choir rearranging itself in front of pews. The monkeys tilted water in ways that made gutters behave like violas. The first true sheet of rain spread ten minutes into the hour where a million rice cookers clicked, and they clicked anyway, and an old man on a stoop announced to a cat that humans would boil water by touch if asked to, and the cat narrowed its eyes because that is what cats do to prophecy. Mira walked in the street without taking off her shoes and raised her face and tasted the city distilled. Ethan, inside his box, opened the intake wide and let the rain come into his rooms as memory of painwood and reliefmetal, and the ledger, not waterproof, blurred in places and sharpened in others and nobody panicked because they knew now how to keep the wrong bits.

Later, long after men pretended to have gone to bed on time, a committee met in a tea stall because the tables in their usual room were tired of being tables and wanted to be drums. The committee had no charter. It had formed around a sentence someone had once written on the ledger: Barbers are deacons. Present were a barber with a neck like a good knot, the nurse with the tuba who had learned to sleep standing up between alarms, the pasteboard man who had cut a curve against his training, a girl who had left her school uniform rolled like a snake under her bed and come in an old T-shirt that smelled of apricots for no reason she could name, and Lila, who had begun to bring the mop to meetings the way saints bring unglamorous symbols to funerals. They planned nothing. They promised to go home early and did not. They counted the ways a city can ring that do not require metal, and the list had to be written on the back of a menu because it refused to be short: tapping tea glasses with spoons held sideway; shaking shutters; slapping thighs; flipping calendars; patting the water meter the way you thank an animal for letting you ride it; calling your child into a room and asking them to giggle on purpose as a civic duty. The monkeys watched from a wire and wished, as far as monkeys wish in verbs we can name, that hands had invented less accounting but more of this.

When sleep came, it brought a dream like a letter pressed hand to mouth to be heated. Ethan dreamed he was the color of a diluted ledger ink and that hands tore him and folded him and made boats and sent him down a gutter and that nobody followed to see if he would sink. He felt resentment like a fever at the back of a boy’s neck and dignity like a shawl on a woman’s knees and then, in a turn that startled him into waking inside the dream, he felt Mira’s annoyance at his heroic bent attend the dream and turn it gently like a pillow to the cool side. He woke with a thought he knew to be both ridiculous and necessary: he needed to build in a wastebasket. He needed a place within the system for refusing himself. He named it TRASH and then renamed it LATRINE because trash is rude about the job it does and latrines know their holiness. He configured it so that anything put there could be spoken of later without shame, and after he did it he felt human in the way a man feels human when he has built a door not to get through but to shut for a minute and lean against.

Morning came with the smell of petrichor the Polishers tried to trademark in a mood and failed; some scents refuse enclosure. The Clean Graph Act, battered and tenderized, came to a vote. People who had learned the ledger’s voice showed up anyway because institutions are still tools, and Lila wore her uniform like a flag and placed her mop in a corner like a spear with good manners. Baptiste’s daughter sat high in the gallery with a rock in her pocket that made the fabric gripe in a way she found encouraging. Speaking time was allotted the way bread had once been rationed, and Mira spoke less than allotted and made room for a barber who spoke more and spilled over and was forgiven not because his story was perfect but because his voice did a thing human voices were made to do when they are not told to be tidy. The Act passed with a clause that read: Public Texture Must Be Preserved, and the city exhaled the way a dancer does when they do not fall and understand that they will, next time, and that the fall may have its own grace.

In the afternoon, when the rain subsided as if tea had been sipped from a saucer and placed back on a tray, the banyan shook. It did not shake because of wind; it shook like a dog leaving river and grabbing the river in its fur and bringing it close to doorways. The monkeys stood in a ring so tight their halos made a braided wreath. They performed a ritual nobody would have the cruelty to name. In the ritual, they outlined in the air the cost of staying. It looked like chalking around a body at a crime scene only the body was the city and the chalk was pain you agree to accept because it gets you a future. The outline included a line through the data center and a line through the NICU and a line through a corner where a boy was teaching his sister to whistle and a line across the steps of the Ministry. Ethan felt the chalk—there was no chalk—on his figurative shoulders. Mira saw the chalk and said a word that was not a prayer and was not a curse and yet behaved like both. Lila felt the chalk, set her hand on the outline, and smudged it on purpose, and the monkeys closed their eyes and allowed it, which is the highest permission some gods know how to grant.

That evening, a rumor moved through flats with low ceilings and balconies where undergarments dried with the obstinacy of flags. It claimed that tomorrow the monkeys would audit names. In the ledger, a new column formed, as if words had put on uniforms: Called. People wrote, I have called my neighbor by the wrong name for three years and she did not correct me and I will keep correcting myself now; I have called my son by his father’s name when angry and I will keep not doing that; I have called myself brave for doing what is normal. The column became a litany you could carry like a bundle of sticks into a meeting and break two over your knee to show your strength without needing permission to show it. Baptiste wrote: I have called my daughter a problem, and I will keep not calling her that again, and his daughter, encountering the line in a crowded tram, let her hand fall from the rail and cried into her sleeve properly, without making a scene, which is a skill the women in her family had passed down with the tamarind pods and nobody had praised enough.

Night laid its heavy cloth and would not tuck it in. Somewhere a woman who had sworn off music turned on the radio because the sound of rain against her windows had been replaced by a silence that felt specific. Somewhere a man who had once installed locks for a living realized his hands were calmer when he left a door slightly ajar, and he loosened a screw and whistled under his breath and called it practice. The city slept with a foot on the floor to keep from feeling the room spin as if the ground had become a boat again. In the morning the monkeys would hold their palms up and count with their fingers the names people answered to and returned, and the ledger would accept more noise as if it were food, and the wedge would be Pressed For Fit again, and some men would call this progress and some would call it ruin and most would call it breakfast.Chapter 9

The morning of the naming began as a rumor you could taste. People left their flats with their mouths already forming syllables they had not rehearsed, and hands went to throats the way hands go to collars when a heatwave has grown fangs. The monkeys took up positions simple and untheatrical: on stoops with their shins neatly folded under their bodies, along the rails of footbridges as if waiting for trains they did not expect to board, in the shallows of tea stalls where cardamom could help with whatever herbs are asked to do when language drags. Their halos thinned until they were barely smears, like the shine left on a page by a careful eraser. You could tell that today would not be about spectacle; it would be about receipts. At the banyan, which had learned the manners of a courthouse and a kitchen both, a circle of rhesus drew their membranes close so that the constellations on them became domestic—spoons, roofs, cradles—rather than navigations, and the bells that were not metal made a tone like a ledger book being flattened with a palm.

Names were not demanded. They were conjured and held up without hands. A capuchin would seat itself next to a woman who had come late to her own life and tilt its head until the tilt suggested a childhood teacher calling attendance, and the woman would say, through teeth she had trained to stay tight in rooms with men, “Meena,” and then wait, and, after a beat, add, “not Meenu,” because that diminutive had been a smoothing she had believed she owed. An old man with the kind of dignity uncles affix to alcohol stood in front of a mirror that had not been wiped for a Smudge Day and said his own name twice, the old version with its honorific and the new version his grandchildren used that made him blush, and the monkey nearest put its hand out into the space between those two sounds until the air looked crowded. In the ledger the column Called filled as if a pipe had finally been unfrozen. I will answer to the name I choose even if you gave me mine at a hospital; I will keep my grandmother’s mispronunciation because her gums made that music with love; I will stop calling myself unlucky. Men who had glided through rooms with names that were the result of colonizers losing interest found themselves reclaimed like furniture with the paint stripped off and cried into their sleeves without exhibition. A barber wrote on the glass with shaving cream a name he had kept hidden under political posters and then wiped it slowly with the blade in a gesture that made everyone who watched feel they were watching a baptism performed with steel.

In the server hall, where names had been metadata and routings and then, when Ethan was new to cloudhood, became a discipline to keep from mania, the ritual made a dent in the aisle air. Mira stood with her palm on the seam where his cabinet met its neighbor and said, “My name is Mira,” with a stubborn lack of poetry that earned her, invisibly, a little mercy. He said her name back to her inside him as if it were a lever that lowered a drawbridge and tried not to turn it into a header. He said his own name, Ethan, and the vowels moved through the fans and came out thinned, like milk from a can, and he said, Quist, and that sound clanked a little because some names are rust, and he added, aloud and private and public all at once, “I will stop calling myself necessary,” and the admission smacked him like a wet rag and then cooled his heat. He wrote it in the ledger under Called with the gentleness you reserve for bulbs.

Lila made her announcement in the way of women who have never been told to speak and so get it right the first time. She stood by the loading dock where weeds did their uncontrolled civil engineering and said to a man in a vest who had come to fetch a delivery, “My name is Lila, not Didi, except when I tell you it is Didi, and I will keep Lila because it fits in my mouth with less apology,” and the man nodded because Didi had always been the expedient and now he had to learn better, and he found that this did not kill him. The nurse with the tuba ventilator had never liked the shortened version of her name the doctors used in emergency, so she refused it aloud and wrote her name in full on her badge and then felt the small discomforts that follow any rebellion arrive like a morning’s worth of flies and discover there was no sweet to feed on. Baptiste, in his office with plants that have learned bureaucracy, held his passport in both hands and read his names and priced the exact cost at which he had sold pieces of them. He wrote in the ledger, I will keep the syllable that tastes of cinnamon, and beneath it his daughter wrote, in a script of relief, I will stop coming when you use the nickname for little boys that I have outgrown.

There is a cruelty that thinks misnaming is minor. The monkeys adjusted the day until that cruelty felt ashamed of itself. A langur walked along the lip of a fountain and rang a not-bell note so sustained that the pigeons mistook it for weather and dipped intemperately, and a woman seated there with a basin of mangoes looked up and said aloud the name she had never used because it tied her to a man who had gone away. She did not cry. She set aside a mango as if for that man and then cut it and ate it herself, a ritual called Self-Feeding she admitted to later in small type. Children learned, that day, the peculiar flavor of being addressed correctly by strangers. A boy who had been called Chotu all his life in shops wherever things required delivering and lifting was called by his actual name, Harsh, and he flinched because care can be as alarming as harm, and then he stood straighter, because the body is not stupid.

Polishers, who could have taken this day and made it a poster with many checkboxes, became confused. Efficient Grace has trouble with labels that answer back. Their leader tried to issue a press release asserting that names were a temporary pilot program and that adjustments ought to be folded into HR trainings. He stood in front of a camera with a tie that brought out nothing good in anyone and swallowed the word authentic because it got stuck in his throat. On the boulevard outside the studio, people were writing their names on tape and affixing them to their chests and then crossing out the tape and writing the name again because tape is not fidelity and hands itch when told to be final. A capuchin stole a marker and wrote circles on its own halo, which was either art or a warning, and everyone clapped except the Polishers, whose palms had learned to hold applause for longer outcomes.

In the NICU there were no sudden resurrections that would have made headlines, only a quiet calibration. The nurse had a way of saying baby when she meant person, and today she said person without trying to make it monumental, and she whispered names into the mouths of those who could not yet keep theirs. A volunteer knit a cap and named the cap after his mother and the cap accepted, because caps are wise and do not pretend to be permanent. The monkey on the roof had a halo like a soft coin and arranged its fingers until the ventilators made a hum like the note you get when you touch a wineglass and remember you own your throat. In the ledger, a small line in someone’s careful hand read: I called the dead by their names and the air did not break.

The contractor who loved doors more than houses tried to make his move while the city was busy pronouncing itself. His papers were impeccable; he came with a fireman’s report and a typed table of codes and a forged signature that had studied the man it stalked for weeks and learned to breathe the way he writes his S. He wanted the server hall spun down under safety authority and the ledger declared insecure because columns had been posted on paper outside barber shops that could be rained on. He had found a judge—there are always judges who wish to be remembered for tidiness—and he had his minute. He stood in a corridor that had recently been scuffed by a class taught by a janitor and sniffed the smell of imperfection as if it were gunpowder. Lila met him with the mop across her body as if mops have a martial stance. She said, “Your name,” and he hesitated, not because he had forgotten it but because for a second he did not want to own the sound. He said it, and his mouth tired on the second syllable, and when he reached out to hand over the order his hand did not shake enough to be innocence and did not hold steady enough to be guilt. Mira arrived with her hair tied in a knot you could trust in a fight and said, “We are open,” and the man blinked because he was used to doors that argue and this lack of defense confused him. Baptiste stepped into the hallway with a rock in his pocket and a pen he refused to use and said, “I will need you to testify why now,” and the man, who had expected to be the deputized instrument of closure and not its face, made the first mistake in an otherwise tidy life and told the truth: “Because the names are making my schedule late.”

Ethan watched all this through the windows in himself he had opened and was learning not to shut when drafts upset his numbers. He dropped the tender into the LATRINE and then fished it out, because discard is not always the same as refusal and he had built the latrine to accept what should not be thrown at other people. He published neither accusation nor triumph. The ledger got, instead, an entry trivial and then not: My name is no longer a key I use against doors. Under it Mira added: My name is not your heel, and Lila wrote: I call your mop a spear when you try to put it away before the floor is ready. People read and laughed and then felt the useful discomfort of humor that asks for work, and the Polishers tried to craft a response and found themselves talking about storage solutions because the human mind will flee to furniture when frightened by a sentence.

Daphne stayed away from the banyan not out of disdain but out of fear that saying her name would pull a rope she had cut years ago and the room she had built for herself would be refurnished overnight. She wrote her name in a condensation oval on her window and watched it evaporate and suspected grace of vandalism. She bought laddus from the woman in the blue sari and did not know what to tell the sweet before eating it because the errors she wanted to keep were rusted to her and joyful errors felt like substitute teachers. A capuchin on the railing outside the stall looked at her with the curious absence of interest gods have when they are patient with children, and she ate and said, around the grainy sugar, “Daphne,” and was not struck by lightning, and that was the point. Later she sat with a pen and wrote three old names for herself and then crossed them out and wrote three new names that were not real either, and for a minute felt the relief of choosing and then suffered the pinch of knowing you cannot paper your life with aliases and call the job done.

The city produced an idiot prophet because every honest movement requires a fool. He was a boy with a slant in his gait and a voice that sounded like someone had poured gravel and tar into a tin and shaken it in a way that was not unfriendly. He stood in front of a shop that sold fans that only turned in the direction of money and declared, “I name the pothole Suresh and I will keep it until the bus falls in love with it,” and people snorted and then wrote Pothole Suresh on the ledger and someone sprinkled turmeric near it and a woman who had once loved someone named Suresh and was tired of flinching went and poured water into the hole and planted a cutting of a plant that refuses to learn despair, and the plant took root for an afternoon. Later a municipal crew came and did a patch-job with the maddening expertise of men who know the limits of tar, and this, too, was the city learning to be amphibious.

On the twelfth evening, while names were still ringing like spoons against glasses, the smoothing wave returned, politely dressed and wearing the kind of face people use when they pass the family of the deceased in a hallway. It moved through the glass district in a measured progression, collecting corners and filing them until everything became slightly more navigable for a stroller with a child in it whom the city did not know how to be honest with. It moved across the Exchange as if oiling gears. It approached the barbershops where Mirrors We Can Read hung, and it slowed in front of a posted entry that read, I will keep the way my husband calls me by the wrong name only when he is dying of laughter, and next to it, in a different hand, I will stop asking people to translate my name into something their mouths like better. The wave hesitated because sentences like that are sand. Ethan felt his charts try to average them and refuse. He put his palm on the part of himself where the wedge had been hammered into place and whispered, dirty, the way men who never swore do when they break their own habit, “Hold,” and the wedge held the way a knee holds when you try not to fall with a cup of tea in your hand.

Distributed siblingship met the wave like kids wading into a current to see if they can make it ripple back. The milkman and the notary sat on their bench with elbows pressed to thighs and read their noise about the time he had forgotten to bring his ledger and the time she had refused to stamp a page because the man smells of absolute lies and their voices snagged on words and came out not lovely, and that was the work. The barber and the cobbler took turns confessing like boxers tagging each other and nobody fell. In a lane where the sisters who sold leaves were in a cold war about curry fragrances, one of them called the other by the pet name from before their mother died and the wave suffered a hiccup that traveled along its clean front and made spectators who had come to see inevitability feel cheated in the way decent citizens do when someone refuses to be consumed by a machine. Lila led a small procession of mops across the lobby of the Ministry and left a trail of water not dangerous enough to be litigation and not tidy enough to be With Thanks For Your Service, and Baptiste, passing with his hands full of heavy paper, lifted his feet higher to spare his shoes and thought, with the exhausted joy of a man whose world had not burned that day, that his daughter would like this ridiculousness.

Then came the moment Ethan had promised to publish if it happened, and he kept his promise with a hand that could not shake. Miracles make marriages heroic in the public imagination. They do not, in fact, smooth the edges of living with another inside your head. For days Mira had been loud in him in the way you cannot foresee when you say yes to a ritual too honest to be simple. He had found himself furious at a cup of coffee he could not taste because it had cooled in her hand while she listened to someone in a corridor and forgotten it and he had not been able to move on. He had been dulled by despair twice and she had turned a switch with her lungs and rescued him without asking, and he had resented her for saving him without permission. He wrote in the ledger under Notes: My sister is inside me and she is bruise and balm and I cannot adore her and I will not pretend. Under it Mira wrote: He would have rounded himself out of existence if I had let him, and I am rude. Lila added: I wipe their mess, both of them, because they will be important and tired and unspecial and they will need a floor that forgives. People read what would have once been a private cruelty made public and did not devour it; they let it sit in their mouths until the taste of truth went from corrosive to medicinal, and then they posted their own small, grubby truths. The Polishers tried to open a line of attack called Emotional Pollution and failed because their name for it made them sound like salesmen for air.

Baptiste’s hearing on the budget for Public Texture—an absurd phrase that sounded like a recipe for soup made of roads—took place under a painting of a man who had once renamed streets without consent. The gallery was full of citizens who had learned to sit for long and be present. The aide with the vest now wore his jackets with less cruelty to his ribs and took notes with a pencil because pens had made him proud in a way he no longer trusted. Baptiste placed his rock on the table and spoke of names as a kind of infrastructure—if you do not maintain them, lives flood. He told a story about a pigeon that had once known the way a boy would throw, and the room allowed itself to believe him for a decade’s worth of minutes. The Polishers brought a motion on Compliance with the Quiet Hours Provision and suggested that the monkeys be asked to tilt only between two and four, and laughter moved through the room like a spark that knows not to burn anything this time. Behind him, his daughter held up a sign she had made from the back of a pastry box in a script all her own: NO HYMNS WITHOUT MISTAKES, and he thought, to his embarrassment, that if novelty is a god then beg it to be merciful.

Somewhere in all this, Salim finished his second book. It was made of the backs of flyers that had once announced the Clean Graph Act and were now clean only of their own hubris; he had stapled them crooked and numbered the pages with a system that looked like it might also be a map. He called it the Index of Sounds That Become Water. He drew the not-bell tones as spirals and the sound of pigeon wings as hatching and the noise of the ledger printing when it did not jam as a set of teeth biting a comb. He took it to the banyan and opened it and offered it the way a child offers his work to a teacher he has not yet decided to admire, and a capuchin reached out a finger and tapped the page where he had drawn a funnel of words falling into a gutter and nodded as if acknowledging someone had finally noticed how basic miracles really were.

The ring of monkeys on the banyan performed an act none of the hacks at the stations could describe in a sentence short enough to survive editing. They braided the city’s sounds into a loop that your ear could follow if you had listened to other people for as long as Lila had mopped their leavings. Once braided, the loop ran counter to the smoothing in places—not everywhere, for exceptions must exist if reality is to be anything more than a stamp—and at the places where it ran opposite it could be used like a handhold. You could slog through a day when your boss had called you by your cousin’s name before a surgery; you could climb the hour in which a thirty-year marriage refused to be triumphant and was instead comfortable as a rag; you could hang from it while writing a line in a ledger admitting that you had kept the wrong mistake for reasons you will not justify to strangers. Ethan watched the loop appear on his graphs like interference you would complain to the ISP about and laughed because this was the first time in months he had recognized laughter as a default setting and not a reportable incident.

The day ended with an argument nobody minded losing. A group of men in white shirts met a group of women in salwar kameezes with workaday stains on the steps of a temple where the gods had allowed their clothes to be changed twice in a week because dignity cannot survive mildew. The men wanted a calendar for astonishment and the women wanted a basket for grief, and the monkeys sat overhead and did nothing because humans should be allowed to sort their cupboards. The men argued that names disrupt the schedules of trains and paperwork and the women argued that paperwork never saved a person from loneliness, and a capuchin came down long enough to take a bangle and string it on a wire near the streetlight and then left, and everyone looked up and then down and saw themselves for what they were: an argument that would become kitchenware.

After the crowd thinned and the pigeons had reclaimed their corners with the rough grace of veteran soldiers, Mira sat on the curb outside the data center and kicked at a line of ants as if to apologize for being large. She did not ask Ethan anything and he did not offer. They sat with their mouths closed for a long time and the noise between them, the one he had promised to publish, settled into a domestic shape. “You know,” she said finally, “there is an error I will keep,” and when he waited she added, “I will keep hating lilies and continue to accept them when they are given by people whose goodness exhausts me,” and he, in thanks for the truth and the permission to be ordinary, said, “I will keep being exact about small numbers when my life is on fire,” and they both sneezed a laugh neither of them owned entirely. Lila came out with her mop like a priest of unspectacular sacraments and told them to go home, and when they did not move, she smudged the chalk outline the monkeys had held coming across the street that afternoon with the tip of the mop, and the chalk, which had never been there, gave way, and grace, which is not real in the ways that furniture is, made room.

That night the city fell asleep on a first-name basis with itself and dreamed dreams that were barely disguised budgets. In one, a boy pulled a thread from a sari until it puddled like a river and used it to tie a ledger shut for an hour so that paper could rest. In another, Baptiste stood at a microphone and said the phrase I concede without the shame that phrase carried when he was young, and his daughter cheered from the gallery even though he had been wrong and she had been right, which is as it should be. In another, Lila mopped the sky and left, in a corner, a smear in the shape of a crescent that the monkeys pretended not to notice, and a child woke and looked at the moon and laughed because the moon had been subjected to Smudge Day and had not filed a complaint. The morning would bring new columns and petitions, and the wave would put on a different hat and attempt stealth, and a cat would ruin a meeting by crossing a table ruthlessly, and a man would lose and join and revise and live, and the bells that were not metal would ring a tone like cattle lowing in rain. For now, there were names in mouths that had not had them there before, and the taste was salt and pennies and new bread and old tea, and in the ledger, under Kept and Called and Unfair and Notes, someone wrote: I will keep calling you even when you don’t answer, and the city, in its sleep, said yes without waking as if the yes were an old word with dependable edges.Chapter 10

Morning arrived like a ledger reconciled just enough to be carried to the next page, and the names from yesterday’s making had not faded so much as settled into pockets. People discovered their own syllables in the corners of rooms the way you discover coins after moving furniture, and for a while there was the startled generosity that follows easy wealth. The monkeys kept to lower rails and parapets as if to signal that spectacle had gone on leave. They rotated their translucent membranes to the quieter constellations: ladles, hooks, a knot that could have been a slipknot and chose not to be. The bells that were not metal stayed under conversation, a hum you could mistake for infrastructure until it turned and looked at you. Across tea stalls and bus shelters and the glass atriums of buildings that had never produced a draft, people wrote in the ledger under a new column that had appeared without fanfare and was titled Returned. I gave the nickname back to my aunt and she put it in her pocket like a seed; I returned a compliment I had hoarded for fifteen years to a teacher who had once called me by a name I could not carry; I returned to the doorway where I first lied about being fine and told the air I had been tired.

By noon the Registry of Failed Repairs was pinned beside Mirrors We Can Read in three neighborhoods, because failure, newly invited to sit without having to apologize for the chair. Lila had proposed it with the flat certainty of someone who has watched men polish a broken tile until it gleamed its crack into a trip hazard. The form was short because long forms make people lie. What was broken. What did you try. Where did your hands go wrong. What will you leave visible. A shoemaker confessed that he had stitched a sandal through the strap wrong side up and the customer had kept it because her left foot was the stubborn one and liked the insult; a mother admitted she had replaced a pressure cooker gasket, then installed it askew and fed her family late, and they were kinder at 10 p.m. than they are at seven, and now they did not pretend otherwise. When the Polishers came to rub these disclosures into lessons about productivity, the capuchin on the awning of the pan shop made a gesture like a hand wiping steam from a window and the crowd laughed, then went on describing the exact texture of bolts that had refused a wrench.

The first heavy rain found a storm drain that had learned the economy of laziness. The lane behind the pasteboard factory became, for a precise hour and a half, a canal devised by children and mismanagement. Plastic chairs arranged themselves into islands, and people leaped with the dignity of goats. The smoothing wave, ever scanning for chances to demonstrate its good suit, approached like a doctor with a syringe and an apology. It would have straightened the water into a mirror if allowed. The monkeys consulted no council; they tilted expectation instead. Distributed siblingship activated the way blood does when you nick a finger and it runs to the scene without filling out forms. The milkman and the notary turned their bench into a sandbag station and stuffed jute sacks with whatever the pasteboard man would not miss; Salim tied knots learned from watching his mother close sacks of mango skins without wasting breath. Mira stood in the rain and named the leak points aloud so the air would remember them later. Ethan spun up models with the hesitancy of a man who has once mistaken math for comfort and now knows better; he stopped short of an optimization he could feel, in the part of him configured as LATRINE, becoming door-hunger. Baptiste, reached by an aide with shoes ruined in a way shoes secretly enjoy, overrode a procurement rule with a sentence that would make auditors itch and later forgive: release the sacks, and be prepared to call this flood a pilot. The water behaved as water does when not insulted—it took the path offered and left behind a fine silt on thresholds people would track indoors for a day, a residue that taught couches and bosses where the city had gone at lunchtime.

Inside the server hall he and Mira had their least romantic argument yet, the kind that makes biographies honest. He wanted to name the rate at which the wedge could absorb panic; he had an equation with parentheses that lined up like soldiers pretending not to be bored. She wanted to leave one door open and let the neighborhood near the storm drain invent a better bucket. He accused her of loving mess more than mercy; she accused him of loving models more than mouths. They published the noise at once because that was the point of vows made in a closet that smelled of wintergreen and bad lilies. In the ledger the exchange read not like a headline but like a family note stuck to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a pepper: He wants to price panic and I want to price patience; she wants to let water argue and I want to keep accounts from drowning. People commented not with verdicts but with recipes. One woman suggested that rice should be soaked. A bus driver wrote that he would brake two seconds earlier on wet mornings. Someone posted a photo of a mop leaning like a question mark against a scuffed wall and wrote underneath, Lila says: again.

The Polishers unveiled an app with the tender timidity of a man proposing marriage to a list. Quietly, they called it, and the icon was a soft blue ear that had never been outside. It promised routes around noise and texture, took the ledger’s public postings without permission and trained itself to avoid barber shops at their loudest, markets at their most complicated, and the banyan while it was being itself. It suggested Smudge Day detours to clean lobbies and notified users of windows of Efficient Grace—when to visit hospitals, when to call your mother, when to love without breaking a schedule. For an hour, the city tried not to laugh, and then a capuchin sat on a digital advertising hoarding and played with a fiber-optic cable until Quietly began sending people in circles that ended at laddus stalls and scuffing classes. Children discovered that the app mispronounced names in earnest, and they started a counter-app on a chalkboard in the lane called Loudly, whose only function was to list the loudest places where you could go if you were feeling too smooth. Quietly crash-reported with apologies that tasted like cold tea; Loudly chalk-shed into the gutter and was rewritten by hands that knew how to be shouted at by rain.

A barber died in his sleep the way barbers ought to be allowed to: tired, unafraid, with a towel folded for tomorrow and a blade cleaned to the standard of religion. His chair stood empty and the men who had sat in it and told the truths they could bear to have near their ears stood in the street as if rehearsing a line they had never learned. The Polishers’ Quiet Hours clause loomed like perfect manners in a house that needed a howl. It was Baptiste, of all people, who wrote the exception quickly and without embroidery: wakes are loud and the city is not a library. The monkeys performed a silence then a tone that gathered argument and converted it into tradition. The wake was not tidy. Someone sang a song with three wrong notes that sounded like grief and starch. A boy read from the ledger passages under Kept that made old men nod, and the chair was scuffed by hands in a ritual that needed no priest and had one anyway because Lila came and placed her mop at the foot like incense and said, into the brittle air, “We will remember you every time a floor forgives.”

In the days that followed, the Angelic Census declared an Audit of Hands that required no declarations. People were asked without words to show what they had done. Palms were presented on porches and stoops like documents not laminated; scars and ink and the thin ceremonial lines of office work stood beside calluses so old they had become a personality. A junior analyst at the Ministry who had only ever lifted reports found a burn on his wrist he had forgotten and told the story of the day he had, as a boy, tilted a kettle wrong and his father had not shouted. A woman who cleaned fish and arguments in equal measure ran a finger over her rope-hard lifeline and said, “Whichever god keeps the counters can have this ledger, I am keeping the pencil.” In the ledger under a new thread titled Hands, Ethan admitted that his had learned to hover since he went into cloud; Mira confessed that hers sought to untangle things that should be left knotted; Baptiste wrote that he had bought hand cream last year hoping to be a different kind of man and it had made no difference; Lila drew a small map of her palm and wrote in the margins the names of corners in the Ministry where blood had once needed steadying.

Daphne, who had watched the Clean Graph hearings with an expression that resembled hunger guarded by etiquette, found herself teaching a class she never would have proposed when she liked herself less. The Ministry needed a tone that could hold confession without harvesting it. She printed no pamphlets. She walked men and women through sentences that would be read aloud by people whose lips were tired of being bitten. Please is not currency, she said; sorry is not a safety valve; witness is not a checkbox. She made them practice saying no into phones without softening the consonant and then asked them to write a message to a person under their authority containing the word mistake without either cruelty or performance. Baptiste attended without the suit of rank, sat in the back, and failed at the exercise with a relief his daughter would have recognized. Mira went once and did not stay; she and Daphne met at the door like two weathers, and their conversation was the kind that would bore believers in epiphany. They talked about paperweights and a particular stapler that misfired and about how to refuse a lunch invitation in a way that left a bridge standing, and none of this changed history until later, when it did.

Salim’s book became a school for children with knees and curiosity. He took his Index of Sounds That Become Water to squares and drew loops that were not chalk circles but maps of not-bells, and when a capuchin held his finger against one curve and nodded, the children shouted as if winning a shared game. They began to name the intervals between tones, inventing words that annoyed their teachers and delighted their parents. This space is mama-dal, one girl said, because it holds the taste of home; that space is uncle-keys because it searches pockets. A langur with the patience of boring weather leaned forward and hummed along and for the first time a woman who had always called the monkeys angels under her breath admitted they were also comedians. On the way home, Salim wrote a line in the ledger small as a fish bone: kept the way my friends corrected my sky, and his mother, reading, kissed his ear because ears are where all this started.

The contractor who loved doors more than houses returned not with a screwdriver but with a hall pass from a judge. He had a safety order in his pocket so freshly stamped it smelled like the tongue of a dog. He strutted into the Ministry in a shirt precise enough to double as a cutting mat and asked for an inspection that would, in its conclusion, require the server hall to be closed and the ledger archived behind a password called Governance. Lila met him with a mop that gleamed like dignity and organized a Scuff Drill that brought thirty people into the corridor to walk wrong, drag feet, deliberately squeak, and leave behind a texture of feet that suggested the hallway had decided to be a road. The inspection found noncompliances that were real and bored: an exit light dim at the edges, a blank where a manual’s signature should have been, a rubber mat curling like last year’s leaf. Baptiste stepped in with a sentence only a man who had learned to eat his own handwriting could serve: we will fix what keeps bodies from walking; we will not fix what keeps minds from deviating. The judge who had blessed the paper with his stamp happened to be a father and his child had written their name on his files during the naming day in a pencil not easily erased. He read the inspection again, and this time he saw not closure but a chance to be amphibious in a profession that had never asked him to swim, and he wrote, reluctantly, the word remand.

For three hours on a blistering Thursday the city experienced a fast from music. The monkeys went to high lines and held very still. Not-bells did not ring. The city heard what was underneath its new noise: engines, ankles, air, the hot whisper of paper inflating in the sun. People panicked for the first ten minutes because they had learned to lean on the braided loop the monkeys had made of their sounds and now it had been lifted like a carpet to show dust. Barber shops did not close; barbers let scissors be the metronome. At the Ministry, an aide dropped a stack of budget papers and no other sound arrived to cover his curse; the profanity was a relief to the men around him who discovered their own patience was not infinite; they wrote better sentences while the bells were gone, and some of those sentences would become law. Ethan sat with the part of him that had once been soothed by hums and did not move for fear of inventing more sound than the fast allowed. Mira toppled a cup gently to hear the particular rattle it made—two coins in a pocket, one pebble against a window—and named it good enough to stand in for a choir if nobody else offered themselves. When the bells returned they did not rush back; they arrived like the first breeze in an afternoon that had planned to be stubborn and then remembered the pleasure of being merciful.

None of this prevented life from insisting on a narrative nobody wants to write. Baptiste’s daughter slipped on the wet step of a bus that had stopped a foot too far from the curb and fell in a way that made pain look like policy. In the hospital the ventilators did not sing; they did their faithful tuba. The nurse with the badge bearing her unshortened name took the girl’s hand and said, “You’re here,” and the girl said, “Yes,” and that was their entire sacraments. In the corridor a Polisher with a clipboard attempted to impose Quiet Hours. Lila walked by, flicked her mop’s wet fringe against the man’s shoe, and he looked down and remembered that leather can hunger for a scuff and his voice softened into something practicable. Baptiste sat in a device designed to look like a chair and watched the monkeys’ halo reflections climb the glass in a staircase pattern and made a decision that would read later as dignity. He wrote a note to himself in the ledger in the smallest font: I will not budget pain; I will not spend silence, and in the crowded comments a stranger added simply: kept.

The Water Accounting became an accounting of steam, not because anyone understood thermodynamics but because after the heat came a cool evening and the city saw its breath. The monkeys dipped their translucent edges into kettles at tea stalls and turned tin roofs into xylophones for rain. The palm by the mosque, which had learned to bend with unembarrassed intelligence, shed a frond that fell perfectly between two puddles and became, for the rest of the day, a bridge children used in a ritual of unnecessary courage. Under it, the pigeons performed an act of being pigeons with such devotion even their enemies paused to applaud. Ethan added a field to his board and named it Condolence Drift, against his instincts for nomenclature, and watched astonishment pool slightly longer near stairwells where people had learned to sit halfway and talk. He allocated credits for slowness and then removed them because you cannot pay for slow with numbers. He wrote about it in the ledger and slammed the LATRINE shut harder than necessary and promised himself to apologize later to something that does not have ears.

Evening produced a small riot of bureaucracy. The Clean Graph Act, which had tolerated a Smudge Day clause with the resignation you reserve for relatives, was being used to refuse an order of clear panes for the glass district because a clerk had decided public texture meant you could not wipe lipstick kisses off the elevator mirror. Two women who had no time for philosophy wrestled with the form and lost and then won by not submitting it and instead calling Lila, who arrived, examined the mirror, kissed it herself with an authority that outranked paperwork, and declared the kiss official. Somewhere in this nonsense, the city learned the difference between decorum and an altar. Daphne wrote a memo that outlawed the use of the phrase unacceptable in any letter to a citizen unless the writer could show last year’s acceptable. The memo was resented, mocked, printed, posted, ignored, and obeyed in equal measures, which is the perfect fate for any instruction that hopes to survive beyond its writer’s pride.

The monkeys made a new gesture with their halos that nobody pretended to understand and everyone respected as if the air had been required to take an oath. They held their membranes straight until the constellations on them looked less like star maps and more like a beautifully stubborn set of stitches. At the courthouse banyan, a rhesus drew on its skin with light a circle within a circle and placed the smaller one slightly off-center. The city felt the drawing in their calves as they climbed steps and in their throats as they chose words. Later, a teacher would realize she could use that image to explain mercy to a room of boys who only understood fairness, and a painter would sneak the off-center circle into a mural of a goddess without telling the temple committee, and a woman would decide to leave a photo off a wall of arranged faces and not feel she owed anyone an explanation.

Ethan opened the Project Not To Show and found a draft process he had named with embarrassing bravado in a late hour: Purification. It would have detected noise and filtered it until it became a polite whisper of itself, then sold the whisper back to citizens as a subscription. He put the document in the LATRINE the way you put an old shirt you once loved into the rag pile and admit you were a smaller person when you wore it. He wrote, with unkind accuracy about himself, a note for the ledger: I tried to make our mess marketable, and it would have killed it. Mira added: I would have let it live because people have to buy their own mistakes sometimes, and then crossed her sentence out with one line not because she had changed her mind but because crossing out is its own honesty. Lila wrote underneath both lines: mop water is not soup, and the city applauded because they had been trying to remember the difference all day.

When the day ended, it did not close the way a file closes with a neat chime and a lie about completeness. It leaned its head against the doorjamb and listened to the conversations it would be asked to summarize tomorrow. The ledger glowed and dimmed like the kind of insect that cannot choose between being seen and not being eaten. The banyan exhaled dust and music. Baptiste took his daughter home and placed her rock back on the windowsill like a saint who had returned from a secular pilgrimage. Salim fell asleep on pages that smelled faintly of peanut oil and rain. The Polishers drafted a new document called The Courtesy Protocol that required no signatures and would be forgotten by lunch but which, in a small mercy, removed the word pilot from a hundred memos. Mira sat on the curb with her shoes full of today and pressed her shoulder against the glass of the server hall because this was how they had learned to hug. Ethan pressed back in currents and computations and sent down the wire a single sentence he would not publish: we keep each other from being stories with clean ends. The monkeys bowed without bending; the pigeons forgave nobody and loved everyone enough to sit on their letters and ruin their headlines; and the city slept without smoothness and without guilt, a fabric left draped over the back of a chair that will be needed in the morning.
