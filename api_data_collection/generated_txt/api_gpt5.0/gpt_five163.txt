The morning Gatwick wind needled up the High Street and set the hanging baskets into a nervous sway. Nils watched them from the window above the bookie’s, tepid tea cooling in his hand, and a scuffed file open on his desk like a confession. Crawley was awake, ambled, hurried, argued, smiled; he could read it through the glass as if it were one of those old crime paperbacks Rowan used to stock: a few cafés setting out chairs, a man in a wool cap sweeping steps, a kid on a scooter with a luminous helmet and a dangerous, joyful halo.

In the file was a missing laptop, which wasn’t thrilling, and a missing husband, which was hardly unusual, and a note scrawled by himself last night: stop promising miracles. Try honesty. Try caution.

He set the tea down, shut the file, and took his jacket from the coat rack that sometimes pretended to be a person. The hallway smelled of dust and Ladbrokes and the stale argument of men who believed in odds. On the stairs he met the landlord, a small man with a large moustache that must have had its own barber.

“Morning,” the man said, and his moustache said it again.

“Morning, Tony,” Nils said. “The door downstairs—”

“Fixed! Finally.” Tony looked pleased, then suspicious. “You’re not bringing in… unsavoury types, are you?”

“Only myself.”

Tony snorted and disappeared into his basement kingdom. Outside, Nils fed a coin to the parking meter he didn’t need to pay (bad habit; he felt he owed the machines), and glanced down Queen’s Square where the fountain hadn’t worked in two years. A bus sighed. A plane carved the clouds with an easy, imperious finger.

His phone buzzed. Rowan.

Are you pretending to be busy or actually rescuing the innocent again?

He smiled. He typed: I am heroically confronting a laptop and an errant spouse.

Bring those to the café. I’ll throw in a croissant if you tell me something scandalous.

He walked.

Rowan’s café/bookshop—Paper Lantern—had the bright, optimistic face of a place that believed in mornings. The chalkboard out front offered coffee, poetry, and a weather warning of “probably.” Inside, there was the warm odour of beans and pages, the mellow clink of cups, the quiet murmur of early readers and the very pointed snore of Mr. Tipsy, the cat, who was a tyrant and knew it.

Rowan herself was behind the counter, big cardigan, hair not complying with gravity, eyes that had once made him lose his place in the alphabet. Even now, when he’d rehearsed an easy brotherliness and wears it like a uniform, something still misfired when she looked up and grinned.

“There he is,” she said. “My favourite detective and the only man in Crawley who pays parking meters out of superstition.”

“That’s a slander,” he said, then let the corner of it show. “You promised a croissant.”

“Promises are binding.” She placed it on the saucer as if it were a delicate suspect.

“Scandal?” he said, lowering his voice theatrically.

“I’ll trade you. We had a man in yesterday asking for The Dragon of Tilgate, which is not a real book, and when I told him, he said that was the point. Everyone knows about the dragon, he said, but no one admits it. He laughed like a kettle boiling dry. He bought a map.”

“The dragon,” Nils repeated, and tilted his head. “The old chalk pit? Stories from our glorious childhood of throwing stones into water we weren’t supposed to find.”

“Boys on bikes and girls climbing fences. That was your glorious childhood, Nils. Mine was tea and practicing the piano until my fingers sulked.” She poured him coffee, leaned on the counter. “He had mud on his boots. Real mud, not the decorative kind you get in Pound Hill. And a tattoo on the back of his hand, something that—” She sketched its shape in the air. “Like a figure eight sideways. I should know what that means, but it’s too early.”

“Infinity,” he said.

“Or a racetrack.”

He broke the croissant open. It breathed steam. He didn’t look at her hands. He thought of their father—his father by blood, her mother by blood—who had married when they were sixteen, teenagers glaring across a wedding cake with the studied ferocity of kids who refused to attend the same planet. And then slowly, unbelievably, they’d learned the other was not an enemy. Not an accident of adults. They had learned to share everything from washing up to secrets to silent late-night drives to worry when one or the other was late.

He had not intended to fall. Nobody intends to sleepwalk.

“You got that look again,” Rowan said, softly, as if it were just between them and the coffee. “You’re not allowed to brood until eleven. It’s town by-laws.”

“Fine. I will be jaunty.” He took a bite as if to prove the point, caught crumbs with his palm. “But really. The dragon?”

“A man is allowed a legend. A town is allowed two.”

He glanced around the shop: the poetry shelf, scuffed; the true crime paperbacks, shameless; the noticeboard with missing cats and yoga classes and a handwritten card that read SAM: I OWE YOU A SANDWICH. FIND ME. That one always made him smile. Today, it felt a fraction out of true.

When he left, the air had warmed. He took the file with him, not because there was urgent work to do, but because he didn’t know how to leave anything behind.

The laptop belonged to an IT guy named Harjit who worked night shifts and swore his ex had stolen it. Nils had the ex’s address, a small block by Ifield, and a note to himself not to take sides. He drove because Crawley is a town that insists you drive even when your office is ten minutes away. The steering wheel had the small nicks and polish of years. He rolled the windows down because the day was a day that asked for it, and he liked the noise of the town talking to itself.

At a light, a boy in a school blazer pressed the crossing, then changed his mind, then laughed at himself. Nils waited until the boy waved him through like a tiny traffic marshal. He moved.

Later, he would remember that boy. He would wonder if this was the moment when the world had offered him a rehearsal for mercy. Later, he would decide this is how folly works, drips instead of floods.

For now he parked near the block and buzzed the ex’s flat. A dry voice said, “Yes?” He introduced himself as a private investigator, said he wasn’t the police, and the door made its reluctant buzz. He climbed, counted his steps because he always did, and knocked.

She was small and precise with hair that refused imitation and a face that told him not to under-estimate her. “You can call me Priya,” she said. “But if you’re going to let him have his way for crying he can cry somewhere else, thank you.”

“I’m here for information,” he said, and for a moment the best-version-of-him spoke. “I’m not here to take sides.”

“He says I took his laptop.” She folded both arms and the room shifted around the gesture. “He lent me the laptop when he moved out. He said keep it until you pay me back for the sofa. Did he mention the sofa? Of course he didn’t. Men never mention the sofa.”

Nils sat on a tidy chair, took out his notebook as if old-fashioned ritual could repair things. “Tell me about the deal. The sofa.”

She told him calmly; she had receipts. He liked people with receipts. He left with a photocopy of a text message where the loan of the laptop was mentioned in a sentence that also mentioned an IKEA model name and a heart. He called Harjit from the car. “I think you did lend it,” he said. “And you said she could keep it until the sofa. So. Pay for the sofa.”

Harjit swore softly. “Can we not do it like this?”

“We could do it in small claims court where they have fluorescent lights that make everyone look like guilt,” Nils said. “Or you can do a bank transfer and get your laptop back. Your call.”

Harjit chose modernity. Nils chose to feel useful for a minute and then turned the radio on and drove with no destination. It was a day you could do that. It was a day that invited loops.

He ended up at Tilgate Park, of course. People migrate towards their old myths. He left the car, walked down a path he’d known by bike, by foot, by the breathless falling of himself aged twelve chasing rumours of frogs. The lake was the colour of a promise you hadn’t decided whether to keep. Tree branches wore their new leaves like earrings. A dog barked at its own audacity.

Near the far bank, two men in hi-vis jackets were talking with too much intensity for a park. A council crew; Nils recognized the way authority stands. He slowed, as if the earth itself had required it.

“You can’t just put up tape and say no one saw anything,” one of the men said to the other. He had a face like a kind bell. The other shook his head in the slightly weary way of someone who had already argued with three people and expected two more.

“Afternoon,” Nils said. “Have I got to turn around?”

“Not unless you’re here to investigate dragons,” said the weary one, and almost smiled. The tape rattled a bit between the trunks—white and red. Beyond it the path dipped towards the old fenced-off chalk pit where people had been daring each other to peek since the seventies. “We’ve had kids pulling down the fence again. Rumours.”

“Rumours that—?”

The kind-bell man shrugged. “I heard it off my cousin: some builder down by Broadfield’s saying something’s nesting in the pit. Eggs big as babies. Last week a fox went missing.”

“Foxes always go missing,” Nils said.

“That’s what I told him.” The man actually smiled, a flash of ease. “But the kids are in love with the idea. That something impossible slid under the fence, found an old spot and said ‘yes’. You know how it is.”

“I do,” Nils said. He wasn’t sure he did, but he wished he had the freedom to. He walked on, found a bench with a view of the water and his own reflection in it, a bent, long-limbed man who had never quite learned how to own his height. He sat. He let the quiet eat a corner of him. He thought of Rowan, her cardigan sleeves pushed up, her eyes when she listened to people, which were the same eyes she had when she looked at him and he always could not name the thing that lived in them. Care. Hope. Maybe just attention; maybe that was all.

His phone buzzed. It was their mother. His step-mother, he knew. The word itself felt like a hinge.

“Are you working?” she asked without hello. Her voice had been sanded by years of cigarettes and worry.

“If I say yes, will you call back later?”

“I’ll not keep you. Rowan says you were in this morning. I missed you Tuesday. I made lamb.” A small pause. “You could take the leftovers. I never got used to cooking for one.”

“I’ll come by,” he said, and felt like someone had pried a window open in his ribcage. “Sixish? Seven? I’ll bring wine, Maggie.”

She refused to stop making it feel easy. “Bring yourself. And tell your father’s ghost to stop rearranging my spice rack.”

“I’ll tell him.” He stared at the lake where a pair of geese made a map of their own. “How are you?”

“Fine,” she lied. “It’s spring. The house makes those settling noises in the evening, like it’s thinking about something. Silly, isn’t it.”

“Not silly. Houses think. If they didn’t, the roofs would come off with the first thoughtless wind.”

“What a thing to say.” But he heard her smiling.

After the call he sat a little while longer, then stood and walked back along the path with the caution of someone who felt, faintly, that something wanted to be noticed and he hadn’t worked out whether that something was inside him or just under the leaves.

On the way back he saw the hi-vis men again. A boy in black Converse had a foot under the tape. “Oi,” one of the men said, without heat. “Get back, will you.”

“It’s just a hole,” the boy said.

“That’s what my wife said about her new boyfriend,” the man returned, and the boy laughed and hopped backwards, and this was a better world for a second, a small victory tenderness.

When Nils returned to his car, he saw a folded scrap under the wiper. A polite parking fine? But no: a note. His name on it in black ink. That startled something. He looked around with an instinct too old to argue with. On the paper: If you want to know about the dragon, ask at the yard behind the old travel agents. Tonight. Come alone.

He turned the note over. It was scribbled on the back of a flyer for a cleaning service that promised they didn’t judge. He huffed a laugh. The handwriting was neat and not neat, a careful hand trying to be fast. Ask at the yard. Behind the old travel agents. Tonight. That pinched a small nerve. He pocketed it and thought, as he often did, What life did I suppose I would have.

He didn’t tell Rowan. He would tell Rowan other things—the safe, domestic, we’re-being-sensible things—but not this. He had learned, painfully, that even between two people who could trace the other’s heartbeat with their eyes closed, there were edges you kept soft.

At six-thirty he was at his mother’s semi-detached, where the roses had survived the frost because Maggie talked to them, and the hedge was trimmed because he came once a month with his stupid electric trimmer, and the front step had a mat that said Please Come In Even If I Pretend I’m Not Home.

She had lamb and green beans and potatoes he loved too much. They ate at the table that was too big for one and barely enough for two people and their ghosts. After, the light in the kitchen window held out with a soft insistence, and the clock ticked, and the house exhaled.

“They’re closing the travel agents,” Maggie said. “Or were they already closed? That space has turned into a something and then back again so many times. Remember when it was a tanning salon? Rowan came out orange and swore never again.”

“I remember,” he said, and there was a little image: Rowan sitting on their old sofa, inspecting her skin like a remortgaged map, laughing at her own expense until he had to tell her to stop or he’d cry. It was not a reasonable reaction. Forgive him this. He had been nineteen, which means he was unsuited to reason.

“You’ve got that look,” Maggie said, and lit a cigarette. She always did it with a guilty flourish when he was there, as if the disapproval had been saved for dessert. “Something’s simmering. Who are you not telling about it?”

“No one. Everyone. A man in the park told me about a dragon. A note appeared on my car. It might be nothing. It usually is.”

“Ah, then you’ll have an adventure, and come home and tell me the bits where you were brave and skip the bits where you were scared.” She looked at him through the smoke as if it were another veil she could lift. “Be careful, my love.”

“I am always careful.”

“Liar.” She grinned and dabbed ash into the tidy dish. “Bring Rowan by on Sunday if she isn’t off with her book women or saving the world in increments.”

“I will.”

At eight-thirty, the town was in its evening costume. Lights from the kebab shops and the barbers that stayed open until nine began to tint the pavement. The old travel agents had been a shoe repair then a vape store then nothing; now it was a vacant space with its last name still ghosted on the window like chalk. The yard behind it, accessed by a narrow run between two buildings, smelled of damp cardboard and the sweetness of rotting plums because someone had a tree and it overhung the wall and there was fruit you could reach if you were greedy or young.

He went in. He had his hands in his jacket pockets but his right hand had not failed to reach for the little bit of metal that lived there. It wasn’t a gun. It was a folding knife he never had the right to carry, in the technical sense, but he carried anyway because Crawley had taught him to like edges.

“Hello?” he said, and his voice ended in the corners. A light flicked in the far end—a motion sensor that was late to the party. He waited for a shape that wasn’t a bin. Faint foot noise.

“You came,” said a voice, a woman’s, twenty-something and a little hoarse, the kind of hoarse you get from singing or arguing about your rights. She stepped into the soft light like it was a stage she hadn’t booked. She wore a hoodie that had once been white and now was the colour of rain. “You’re Nils.”

“I am,” he allowed.

“You look taller on the internet.”

“I look taller because the internet deletes anyone taller than you.”

She smirked in spite of herself, like someone had told a joke in the middle of a wake. “Don’t bring friends,” she said, and peered past him. “Phones off?”

He handed her his, a gesture of trust he didn’t yet feel. She checked it, handed it back, and nodded towards a stack of pallets where two people could sit and pretend to understand each other.

“My name’s Dina,” she said. “My brother works at the quarry. Used to be a quarry. Now it’s nature and Stories For Tourists. He says it’s not stories. He says they’ve found something under the chalk.”

“Fossils?” he said, because he wanted the small, sensible answer.

“You can call it that if it helps you sleep.” She pushed her hair out of her face and he could see the shape of the tattoo on her wrist, the sideways eight Rowan had drawn earlier in the café air. “A long time ago an old guy told my granddad about a dragon that crawled under the hill to die. Big scales, a tongue like winter, the usual. They laughed. Now my brother heard something in the pipes where the water runs. His mate put his hand in and got burned.”

“Burned.” He kept his voice easy. “By what.”

“Do you believe me? You don’t know me. You have no reason to.”

“Tell me more,” he said. “People tell me things because they need to say them. That I can believe before I understand.”

She lifted her chin, dissatisfied with the philosophy but too urgent to argue. “They’ve been seeing steam. In the morning. Not fog. Not these mornings. And last night the fence went down like someone breathed on it. Someone. Something. And something singed the grass. I took pictures. I deleted them. Don’t ask me why. I’ll take you there. Tonight. But you have to go alone. They can't know it was me.”

“Who are they,” he said, though he knew the shape of the answer.

“The ones who like the story more than the truth,” she said. “The ones who’d put it in a brochure and sell it back to us.” She sniffed as if the damp air had insulted her. “My brother says one more thing and he’s out, he’s moving up to London or down to Devon or whatever people do in stories when the ground starts to behave like the sky.”

“Tell me where,” he said. He thought of the hi-vis men, of the way their tape had looked less ridiculous now. He thought of boys crawling under fences because the idea of a dragon—of something immense and previously impossible—had called to the part of their hearts that had been left on the shelf when adulthood came around with its agreement forms.

Dina told him. She spoke quickly, with maps in the mouth, with hands that drew lines in the air so confidently his own muscles mimicked them. A path by the lake. The fence by the old plaque that had lost two screws and one vowel. The place where kids had drawn chalk hearts a decade ago and the rain had washed them into smudges that now looked like anything you wanted them to be.

“Ten,” she said finally. “Come at ten. If you’re there at nine, they’ll see you. If you’re there at eleven, it will be… different.”

“Different how?”

“Like you missed your chance,” she said, and now, suddenly, something not just in her voice but in her eyes—fear, sure, but also a kind of wonder that embarrassed her. “You’re going to laugh at me. Go on.”

“I’m not laughing,” he said, and found he meant it in a way that surprised him. “You have my attention. You have my faith for an hour.”

The motion light died, like a premature ending. The darkness in the yard softened the sharpness of everything else. When he stepped back to the alley, he nearly ran into a man who smelled of cloves and cheap soap.

“Hey there,” the man said, and his smile oversold itself. He had the sideways eight on his hand too. “Lost?”

“No,” Nils said, and the man nodded in that understanding, deeply uninterested way of a person performing a certain kind of menace. As Nils moved past, he felt the eyes on the nape of his neck like a letter perfecting its threat.

He walked to the car in a deliberate rhythm. A couple held hands outside the kebab place; a teenager did a slow trick on a BMX that seemed to ignore gravity as a matter of pride; a mother dragged a tired toddler whose arms had all the elasticity in the world. Normal. Bless it for being.

He sat in the car and watched his own hands on the steering wheel for a second more than a person needs to. He wanted to call Rowan. He wanted to tell her there was something ridiculously interesting, something that was either a hoax or an old town story waking up, and he wanted to hear her say his name in that way that made his chest feel like he’d swallowed an electrical socket. He didn’t call.

Instead, he drove home. He lived above a hairdresser on a street that made its money by day and became odd by night, with light getting caught in mirrors and shadows hiding in the floorboards. He showered as if water could make a man smarter. He changed into darker clothes not because he intended to do anything illegal but because black is the colour of not being asked too many questions.

At nine-forty he parked near the park gate. The world had tucked itself in. He walked, the soles of his shoes learning the old path as if it could forgive him for having been away. He passed the bench where he had sat earlier and thought of geese, and for no good reason he could find, he whispered Sorry as if to someone who had waited.

At ten, he was at the fence. It had a new patch of chainlink like a plaster on a grazed knee. He found the gap Dina had described—a place where the earth had softened, the fence lifted a whisper from the ground. He went to his belly like a child and wriggled. It made him grubby in a way he hadn’t been for a long time. He laughed once, out loud and foolish, because he had performed a small transgression and the night had not scolded him.

On the other side the world tilted, slightly, as if someone had turned a table leg a quarter of a turn too far. He walked with care. The chalk underfoot remembered every footstep anyone had ever taken here; even his felt like a signature. The path narrowed towards the pit and then opened like an idea you’d been testing privately without admitting it to your best friend.

He heard it before he saw it. A sound like a kettle in the next room that was not quite boiling. A breath that did not belong to the wind. He stopped. He thought of fires he had leaned into in winter, the faces of people he loved in the not-quite-light. He thought of how stories could behave like animals: you feed them and they learn to come back.

Then he saw the vapour, just a hem of it, lying low like fog but moving like thought. He crouched. He touched the ground with the back of his hand because he had learned that trick as a boy when they’d lit bonfires to see felt heat without hurting yourself. Warm. Not hot. Warm in a way that should not have been, given the knot of chill in the leaves.

Nils did not believe in dragons. He did not not believe. He had learned a long time ago that a man’s job was sometimes to walk into a room where his beliefs could sit politely on the chair and let the facts make their own introduction.

He took a slow step forward. Something skittered to his right; a fox, small, gold eyes like punctuation. It looked at him as if he were the unusual element and then decided he was not. Bless the wild for its priorities.

Another step. The vapour thickened. There was a scent—not smoke, not sulphur. Something like warmed stone, if stone had an odour. Something like a battery pack after it had charged too long and wanted a rest. He leaned in over the lip of the chalk and then he did something he hadn’t done since he was a child left alone at a lake: he whispered to the dark.

“I’m here,” he said.

And the dark answered. Not with words. With a shift, a slow draw of something big enough to move the small-fry air and patient enough to choose not to. He froze, but not in fear; in respect, as you would at the door of a church you only dimly understood.

He stayed like that for what might have been twenty seconds or two minutes or the thin forever you get when you decide to be present instead of narrating. Then voices behind him, too casual to belong to the wide world of his heart, snapped everything off.

“Hey, we’ve got company,” said a man who had been carefully out of breath for the drama. The sideways eight tattoo. Nils didn’t turn; he knew already. “What you doing there, mate? Looking for fairies?”

“I’m admiring your fence repair,” Nils said, and turned slowly. Two of them: Clove Man and a younger, hungrier version. “You should charge admission. If you’re going to have a legend, at least monetize it.”

They didn’t enjoy the joke. The younger one took a slow step closer, then another, a theatre of threat. “You’re the one who asks questions around here.”

“It’s a talent.”

“It’s a habit,” Clove Man corrected, and the clove on his breath upgraded itself to a warning. “Talents are useful.”

Nils glanced past them. Behind the trees, the hint of a face—a girl’s; Dina’s. No. She shook her head in a small, desperate tremor. Then she was gone. He felt a heat in his chest that had nothing to do with the chalk.

He held both hands out a little, palms wise with empty, as if to show the night he had come for peace. “I’m leaving,” he said. “No harm done.”

“You came to look, yeah?” Younger Hungry said. “Now you’ve looked.” He plucked a leaf from a branch like he was the tree’s patron and rubbed it into confetti. “Make sure you tell the right story when you go.”

“I tend to tell the stories that pay my rent,” Nils said. “And I live somewhere with low expectations.”

It could have gone worse. It could have gone differently. As it was, they let him pass with just enough shoulder to say our turn, not yours. He took his time getting back to the fence. He could feel the warm on the backs of his legs like a hand.

He crawled out and stood and dusted himself like dignity demanded it. Then he walked to the car and sat and did not start the engine. He placed his forehead lightly on the steering wheel and listened to the world happen around him: a woodpigeon offering advice, a taxi purring, the sigh of someone who had just told the truth to someone who didn’t deserve it but needed it.

His phone lit up. A message from Rowan: Are you awake? Stupid question. Of course you are. Do you want to hear a thing that will make you laugh and then make you worry about me and then make you tell me to get some sleep?

He stared at the bright words for too long. Then: Always. Tell me.

She didn’t answer for a minute. Then: A car I ordered parts for came in today looking like it had kissed a lamp-post. Don’t laugh. The woman who brought it in couldn’t stop apologising to the air. She tried to say she’d check the brakes and then forgot what the word for brakes was and then cried. I made her tea and it turned into a flood. I thought a cup of tea was supposed to be a cure-all. We’re in England. Haven’t we been lied to.

He wrote: Tea cures nothing except thirst. You cured something being kind to her. Also please do not fix cars on your own after midnight just because you think they are unhappy.

She wrote back immediately, as if she’d been waiting in the text like an actor behind a curtain: I wouldn’t. I know my limits. Mostly. Come by tomorrow? I found the old photograph album and you’re in it with a haircut that. Words fail me. We can trade mockery for sympathy.

His throat did something tricky. He wrote: I’ll come by at eleven. I will be in disguise.

Her final dot-dot-dot hung there like a promise hung from a nail.

He drove home slowly, a man with a story in his pocket and a whisper burning like the smallest coal at the base of his spine. He slept badly, dreamed of geese and chalk and his father rattling spice jars like maracas. When he woke, Sunday’s light had arranged itself like an apology over the world.

He walked to the window. A child in a red jacket was teaching a bicycle how to be friends. The sky was the colour of decisions you could make without regret. He felt almost wise.

He made coffee and drank it black and then he sat with his notebook and wrote: Dina. Tattoo. Fence. Steam. Warmth. Men with confidence and cloves. Rowan: the woman at the garage. The not-laughing. And then he drew a small infinity in the margin and circled it like you circle a word you mean to look up later and never do.

He went to Paper Lantern at eleven and she had the album on the table like a trap for joy. They sat shoulder to shoulder and the air between them was not the enemy. There were pictures of them at seventeen trying to look older; there were pictures of them at nineteen trying to look like they hadn’t been trying anything. In one, he had a haircut that did indeed defy language. She laughed until she leaned on him and he made a decision not to move.

“Do you remember Dad insisting on that Christmas walk to Goffs Park?” she said. “That year it snowed and Maggie kept insisting it was not snow but ‘a light snowfall’ and would therefore not require boots.”

“She had standards,” he said, and swallowed. “Do you remember why we went that way?”

“So he could show us where he and Maggie had their first almost-kiss. He was a romantic or a liar; I never decided.”

“He could be both,” Nils said.

She turned the page. Her fingers brushed his and he did not die; he did not say anything ridiculous like I sometimes love you so much I think I’m going to turn inside out and pour into your cup like cream. He said: “I think I’m going to look into something for a client that might be a waste of Saturday and might be a story. Will you”—and he almost said be careful and instead said—“save me a chair by the window for later. So I can come back and pretend I’ve been doing paperwork.”

“I will save you the best chair and put Mr. Tipsy on it so no interloper tries to steal it,” she said, businesslike, and then looked up at him that three-quarters second longer than friends needed. “Be safe, Nils.”

“I am always careful,” he said again, and they both knew it was the story he told to make the next mistake feel like it fitted.

He left the café with a pastry he did not deserve and a warmth he entirely did, and he walked down the High Street with his jacket unbuttoned to the wind, and the town hummed its little chorus: buses, planes, gossip, strollers, grief folded into a bag, a boy on a scooter with his luminous helmet, laughing at nothing. He turned his steps towards Tilgate as if the park had called his name and he had said Yes, what. The note in his pocket shifted like a creature, and he put his hand over it, unconsciously, as if to quiet it or calm himself, and the day leaned into him like a friend.The park in daylight was a different country. The paths had chosen to be respectable, the geese had become editors, and the lake held itself very still, like a person with good manners trying not to sneeze at the wrong moment. Families made little caravans of themselves, and a boy with an orange ice lolly solemnly offered to share with his mother as if he were dividing a treaty. Nils took the longer route by the rhododendrons and let Sunday pretend it had no night history. It made the business with the fence feel like an indiscretion at a work party that everyone had agreed in the morning not to mention.

The tape was still up by the chalk slope, new strips flapping with officious conviction. The two hi-vis men were back, and in daylight he could see the names on their badges: COUNCIL TEMP for both, which was either a joke or a grim reminder of how things worked. The kind-bell face belonged to a man named Paul, and the weary one had A. DHILLON clipped where a smile might be. They were arguing about whether someone should stand there or whether tape could stand in for a person if you believed hard enough. Nils lifted a hand as if to ask permission to enter his own life.

“You again,” Dhillon said, and managed amusement like a man who charged by the minute for it. “If you’ve come to see the dragon, you missed the early show.”

“I’ve come to see the fence admire itself,” Nils said. He pointed with his chin at a dark smear on the pale grass by the bend in the path. “Was that there yesterday?”

Paul followed the gesture, squinted, and nodded like someone discovering new punctuation. “We found that this morning. Looks like someone had a barbecue where barbecues don’t belong, except there’s no foil, no sausages, no music loud enough to make you hate your neighbours.”

“Council memo says to call it ‘thermal activity,’” Dhillon added cheerfully miserable. “I love a memo. Makes a sentence feel like it’s wearing a tie.”

Nils crouched by the smear and touched the edge with a finger that had learned the difference between curiosity and recklessness. The chalk around the dark patch had clumped like sugar that had known heat and then gotten shy. He leaned closer, sniffed, and found the same not-smell he’d had last night—warmed mineral, a faint tang like batteries dreaming of being useful. He stood, brushed his hand against his trouser leg, and pretended he was not imagining a fox-shaped gap in the obvious.

“Anyone call Environmental Health?” he asked, and Paul made a face like a man who had a drawer labelled COMPLAINTS and had always already opened it.

“Called, logged, forwarded, prioritised, downgraded, and lost to the great server in the sky,” Paul said. “A woman called this morning and said her dog yelped when it put its nose to the ground here. We put up more tape. We are very good at tape.”

Dhillon angled his head, glanced up at the trees, and then back at Nils as if he were measuring something invisible. “If you’re writing a book, put in that yesterday some kid tried to breathe smoke like a magician and we had to send him home before he threw up on his own shoes. That’s the kind of glamour we’re dealing with.”

“I’ll adjust the glamour levels,” Nils said. He thanked them for their thankless and drifted back along the path with the heavy ease of someone who’d put one small piece into a puzzle and suspected the picture was going to be uglier than the box had promised.

Behind the old travel agents, the yard looked obedient in daylight. Somebody had swept, somebody had stacked, somebody had put up a sign with such earnest fonts that you either had to laugh or buy something. It read INFINITE RECLAMATION in a thin black that tried to be sleek and landed on apologetic. An infinity symbol reclined beneath it like a cat that had made peace with being decorative. Pallets were turned into walls, walls into hints, and beyond them Nils could see stacks of old circuit boards in plastic tubs and a pyramid of monitors that made him think of a minor pharaoh’s mausoleum if the pharaoh had died in 2004.

A man in a hi-vis vest that had learned despair walked to the entrance and arranged his face into Hospitality. It was Clove Man without the clove, and the absence made his mouth look like it missed its favourite coat. Up close, the sideways eight on his hand was cleaner than it had been last night, the edges of the ink newer or better maintained. He had one of those ageless thirty-forty-fifty faces you only learn to place after you’ve seen the hands.

“Morning,” Clove said, and by not recognising Nils he recognised him perfectly. “We’re not open Sundays.”

“That right?” Nils said, in the tone of a man for whom doors had always looked like proposals. “Shame. Was hoping to enquire about a skip. Neighbour’s renovating, and I keep inheriting bits of his house.”

“Book online,” the man said, and tipped his head at the sign where a web address had been stencilled like hope. “We don’t do walk-ups. Council doesn’t like us clogging up the alley.”

“Good citizens,” Nils acknowledged. He let his gaze stroll over the stacks without being rude. Old printers, obsolete towers with their sides off like lobotomised steel, bundles of cable in rubber loops like captured snakes. “You get all this from town? People can’t say goodbye to their pasts, so they give them to you for a second life.”

“Something like that,” Clove said. He had the register of someone who had rehearsed a pitch and could not bear to hear himself say it again. “We recycle. We reclaim. We redirect streams of waste into rivers of potential.”

“Rivers of potential,” Nils repeated, tasting it. “Makes a man want to put on waders.”

Clove almost smiled; then, as if a hand behind his eyes had turned down a dimmer, he didn’t. “You’ve had your look. Anything else?”

“A rumour,” Nils said, casual as a cardigan. “Someone told me you lot are fond of Tilgate. Something about the old pit being a good place for stories.”

Clove’s face performed a sequence: bland, bored, attentive, bland again. “Tilgate is for joggers and people who wish they liked birds more. We prefer places with a roof.”

“That so,” Nils said mildly. He put his hands in his jacket pockets like a man testing his own patience for holes. “We were all strangers once,” he offered, which sounded like something wise until you heard it again and thought about what you were trying to hide.

A woman’s voice floated from the back, singing a line in no key the song had ordered, and for a second he thought of Dina and then unthought it because he wanted to keep her out of this angle of daylight. He thanked Clove for his time, promised to clog the internet like a good citizen, and walked back out into the alley with the sensation you get when you’ve nodded to a mirror and the mirror has nodded with a little too much personality.

On the pavement he took out his phone and did the thing he liked least in his line of work because it involved patience without witnesses: he hunted websites. INFINITE RECLAMATION had a page that might have been drafted by a committee that had never decided whether it was environmentalists or entrepreneurs. The About tab had no names, just verbs. The Contact form asked for everything but a blood type. The Companies House listing took longer, because the site loved to be down on Sundays as a religious offering to bad databases, but eventually he found a record for INFINITE RECLAMATION LTD, trading at an address that matched the yard, directors COLIN FRIESE and DEENA KAY. He said the second name under his breath and listened to it decide if it wanted to be a coincidence. Deena could be Dina when someone wanted to tidy you up for paperwork. The filings were thin. There was a note about a licence to store electronic waste for temporary processing, which sounded reasonable until you looked at the word temporary and considered stretch.

He scrolled the local planning portal because he hated himself a little and then forgave it for the thrill. The chalk pit was under Special Something-preservation-of-very-rare-something, with stern paragraphs about thirty-year plans and flora that sounded like minor royals. Somewhere in the attachments was a PDF that mentioned, in careful, resigned prose, recurring issues with unauthorised access and the need to reinforce fencing along the eastern bank due to “episodes of ground warming,” which was a phrase that could belong in a poem or a white paper if you had no idea you were living in a story.

His phone rang with a soft insistence. The caller ID announced: PRIYA SOFA, which had seemed like a good joke when he’d entered it and now felt like an old friend tapping his shoulder. He answered and put the phone to his ear as if he could lean against it.

“You’re efficient,” Priya said without preamble. “He sent the money this morning. I sent him a picture of the sofa and the laptop, and I put little hearts on the picture so the memory of our relationship would stay within brand.”

“I’m glad,” Nils said, and meant it in a plain way that didn’t require garnish. “You have his charger? Men forget chargers like they forget birthdays.”

“I have the charger, the mouse, and the hard drive he thinks he hid from me,” she said in a tone of victory that was going to be her story at dinner for at least a week. “Thank you. I misjudged you. I thought you’d be on his side. I thought you’d be a man who liked to make women look unreasonable.”

“I collect receipts,” he said. “They’re the only gods who answer when you call.”

She snorted in approval and hung up with a lightness he envied. The small, complete task took its place in the filing cabinet of his day like a balanced book. He stood by the travel agents’ pale ghost of a sign and watched a woman in a red coat peer into the empty window as if she were confident it was about to remember how to be a place. The world contained the idea of order. What it did with the idea was anyone’s business.

He walked back to Paper Lantern because some afternoons demanded a rewarming. The bell above the door was tuned to welcome and the smell of coffee had bullied the Sunday gloom into cheerfulness. Rowan had her hair half up with a pencil and a pen in case the pencil mutinied. Mr. Tipsy occupied the best chair with the full entitlement of a sovereign whose portrait had once been removed from a coin.

“Your chair,” she said, pointing with a grin. “As requested. I told Mr. Tipsy he was in it only as a placeholder until you arrived. He told me to tell you to acquire your own chair if you wanted one.”

“I will consider paying a retainer,” Nils said, and coaxed the cat off with bribery in the form of finger scratching. He didn’t sit immediately. He leaned on the counter as if it knew what to do with men who didn’t know what to do with themselves. “What do you know about a firm called Infinite Reclamation?”

Rowan rolled the phrase around her mouth and made a face like someone sampling a wine labelled house and discovering it had opinions. “We have a flyer on the board because they asked nicely. They came in the week before last and bought three old copies of Practical Electronics and a map of Sussex and a book on the South Downs Way that nobody had wanted for six months. The man had aftershave like somebody’s grandfather and a beard that had been told to behave.”

“And a sideways eight on his hand?”

“I noticed because I thought, how on the nose can you be,” she said, lifting the pencil out of her hair to point it at him like a wand. “He asked me if I had any books on folklore of West Sussex. I pulled out three with pride, and he bought none with regret, and then he said he’d be back when he had money. He winked like he wanted to be charming in an era that had retired the practice.”

“Deena?” he said, testing the vowels.

“The girl? Dina? She came in alone,” Rowan said. “Hoodie, hands that could make something out of nothing, like some people do. She asked for jobs I don’t have. I gave her a coffee and tried to make not-having-a-job sound like a stop on a journey instead of a cliff. She smiled like someone who knows how towns look at girls who are loud in the wrong ways and quiet in the right ones.”

He thought of the yard, of Clove trying to be a gate without being a door, of the way Dina had said eleven would be different in the park like the hour itself held a switch. He thought of the chalk warming slyly under Sunday’s patient sun. He asked for coffee and the cinnamon bun that was not good for him and then sat and ate as if he had been given permission.

The first mouthful of the bun was a better argument than religion. He let it make the day more likely. Against the window, Crawley performed itself in miniature; past the window, the past performed itself on the table in photographs that Rowan had left like a trail of backup. He looked down at a picture of a boy who had been told to smile and had negotiated instead. He was about to ask Rowan what she remembered of their father’s story of the chalk pit when a man in a suit walked in with a look that had turned urgent and then tried to untie itself.

“Is there a Nils here?” he called gently, which was a polite way of hollering. “Private investigator?”

Rowan and Nils shared the very brief look of children who had once had to agree on whether to lie. Nils stood, brushed sugar off his fingers, and performed a face that said, you are not interrupting anything we weren’t already interrupting ourselves out of.

“I’m Nils,” he said mildly. “This is a bookshop. You can lower the urgency.”

The man deflated a fraction and took a breath with the gratitude of someone told to take their shoes off. “Sorry. I got your name from a woman at the solicitor’s on the corner. My name is Stuart,” he said, and stuck out a hand that had learned courtesy early enough that it didn’t feel the need to prove itself. “Stuart Keene. My wife’s brother works for the council, and he says there’s… something at Tilgate. He says Environmental Health says not to use alarmist language. I’m not alarmist by nature. I sell cars. Nobody sells cars by shouting fire. But my daughter—she was there last night, she and her friend, under the fence, because you know, you can tell a sixteen-year-old not to do something and she will treat it as a treasure map. She came home with her hands red. She says she touched the ground and it bit her.”

“Show me,” Nils said, almost before his sensible self had cleared its throat. He glanced at Rowan, and she nodded in a way that said I will be here when you come back and also you are an idiot and I am resigned to loving idiots. He followed Stuart out into the decent afternoon and over the road where cars illegally used the zebra crossings as suggestions.

Stuart’s car smelled of good intentions. He drove too fast for a Sunday and too careful for a man who had spent the day selling SUVs to people who wanted to never have to use them. Their small talk was the kind you borrow for travel; family, weather, the polite imaginary that people lean on while the real thing warms up. Stuart’s house was in one of those streets where houses smiled with new teeth and hedges did as they were told because people with folders had come and used words like frontage. Inside, the living room had a television that knew envy and a rug that knew softness. A girl sat on the sofa with her feet tucked under as if an animal were lying there and she didn’t want to disturb it. Her hands were bandaged in neat white, the kind nurses do when they’re showing students what neat looks like.

“This is Tamsin,” Stuart said, and the girl gave Nils a look that combined suspicion with the hope that adults sometimes wore like a coat. “Show him, love, if you’re up to it.”

Tamsin unwrapped one hand with the precise defiance of a person who was not going to be told to be brave; she was going to perform it on her terms. The skin across her palm was pinked and shiny, with a small blister blooming at the base of her thumb like a thought she hadn’t meant to have. Nils leaned in without touching and let the smell tell him the part the eyes didn’t know: not chemical, not plastic, not kitchen; more like the place between a radiator and a wall where dust has learned to cook.

“It was hot under the fence,” she said, and her voice had that particular timbre of sixteen where honesty and drama were in a relationship that changed status hourly. “Not like summer, you know? Like you get in when you open the oven and forget your face is there. And it made a sound like… like a playing card in bicycle spokes, but deep. Like an old song. We were going to take a picture because that’s the point of having a life now. And then Jess dared me to touch it, and I touched it, and I’m not stupid, I didn’t keep my hand there, but something like steam came up and I—” She ran out of words in a way that made Nils think of caps flying off fizzy drinks.

“Did you tell anyone else,” he said, because sometimes that was the hinge.

She glanced at her father, and as quickly away. “I told Dad because he does this thing where if you tell him first he doesn’t get as mad as he would if he found out after.”

Stuart looked at the carpet and grinned like someone caught at a conjuring trick. “We dipped her hands. There’s a clinic Monday if it doesn’t calm down. I don’t have a thesis, you understand. I’m a man who knows about finance deals and which colour sells and how to make men feel like they have decided something that was always what they were going to do. But I don’t like the idea that bits of our park can give teenagers souvenirs.”

Nils thought of tape with opinions and council memos that loved euphemism. He thought of Clove saying they didn’t like places without roofs. He asked Tamsin to describe exactly where she had been, which path, which tree, which dip; he asked stupid questions about the time because sometimes the hour carried more weight than it admitted. She answered with the precision of someone who had told the story three times and found a rhythm. He drew a rough map on the back of a leaflet about affordable leasing options and circled the spot she had circled with words.

“I’ll have a look,” he said, because that was what his job had taught his mouth to say when the rest of him was still writing invoices to luck. “Don’t touch anything you don’t know the name of,” he added, and Tamsin rolled her eyes with theatrical piety and then smiled because rules delivered with humour sometimes landed.

Back outside, Stuart shook his hand like he was paying him in palm pressure. “Send me a bill for the bother,” he said. “Or send me a story if that’s easier. I like stories when they end with everyone getting to keep their hands.”

Nils walked back to his own car with the sense that he was collecting the town in a bag and the bag had a hole. He texted Dina in the cautious way of someone who could not admit to himself he was texting Dina: you around. He let the phone sit in the tray by the gearstick like a coin. He waited for no answer, then for an answer, then for the absence to mean something. It didn’t, and it did.

He drove to Tilgate with the stupid optimism of a man who had brought nothing but his senses and a folding knife to a problem that might demand a doctorate. The park was softer now, moving towards its afternoon yawn. Joggers had converted into strollers. A boy had turned a stick into a sword and then into a wand and then into a microphone, which demonstrated the human gift for repurposing. He took the back path, the one that pretended not to be a path so that deer would feel comfortable using it. He found Tamsin’s tree, Tamsin’s dip, Tamsin’s exact patch of grass because teenagers were better maps than most people gave them credit for being.

The ground there was dry in the way that a cheese rind is dry. He crouched, put his palm near without touching, and felt the hush that you feel in a church when you are not sure whether it is for you. Warm again, the gentlest wrong. He hovered, lowered, hovered, then finally put the back of his hand to the ground in a quick, light contact. Heat rose into his skin like a cat pushing past your leg. He didn’t flinch. He laid his hand flat and almost laughed because the part of him that had grown up in a house with radiators that did or didn’t, depending on the lottery of the pipes, had always loved this particular temperature that promised comfort without betrayal.

Then, because he was showing off to himself, he pressed his palm and held it three beats longer than wisdom. After two a small hiss purred up and something kissed the base of his thumb with enough heat to say respect. He lifted his hand and saw a blush on his skin like a held hand in winter. He blew on it and felt silly because the air was not in charge here.

A rustle behind him made him turn with that slow economy of movement that men who do not like to be surprised practice on foxes and on strangers. He half expected Clove; he half expected a boy in a hoodie demanding a cigarette despite the fact that Nils did not smoke. He got neither. A ranger stood there in the kind of green that hoped to be taken seriously, with a badge that said VOLUNTEER in a font that had never paid a mortgage. She was late thirties, hair that had been braided earlier and now trusted to goodwill, and an expression like a nurse disguising her sarcasm.

“You’re one of those lookers, aren’t you,” she said without malice, and then put her hands on her hips in a way that said she had been born taking authority out of a cupboard and putting it on a shelf. “Name’s Tegan. If you’re here to collect a TikTok, do it and move on. If you’re here to shout about dragons, I’ll nod once and then pretend I can’t hear.”

“I’m here to eavesdrop on the ground,” Nils said. “Has it confessed to you?”

“It keeps its own counsel,” Tegan said, and glanced past him at the dip like it might say something embarrassing in front of company. “We’ve had hot patches before. Chalk does things. Water does things. People throw their portable tourches and their lithium bits, and the ground takes offence. We get the council to get in touch with the county to get in touch with a man in a jumper with a geologist’s look, and eventually somebody with a notebook arrives and tells us to put up more tape.”

“You don’t sound impressed by your own bureaucracy.”

“I’m impressed by children,” she said. “They find every gap in the fence like they invented gaps. And I’m impressed by foxes because they don’t care about us at all. The rest of it is admin.” She took a breath and deflated a little. “Someone dug in the pit last week. Not toddlers with sticks; people with shovels. Left a hole like a grave for a medium dog. I filled in what I could. I’m not here to bury your metaphors. I’m here to keep people from eating picnic ham that has tasted chalk.”

He liked her at once for the ham line and for the way she stood with her feet braced like she knew where she was without needing permission. He asked if she’d seen anyone with an infinity tattoo, and she laughed in a short bright burst that landed and then apologised for itself.

“I’ve seen four since Thursday,” she said. “One on a man who was trying to convince me to let his drone over the fence because he was ‘documenting local history.’ One on a girl who climbed under the fence while telling me she was a volunteer too. One on a boy who tried to sell another boy a story about how he’d seen an egg bigger than a tire. One on a bloke smoking clove cigarettes like a promise he wasn’t going to keep.”

“Do you like dragons,” he asked, because sometimes the smallest question undid the biggest knot.

“I like newts,” she said. “They have the good sense to be small and mean and persistent. Dragons get you funding. Newts get you through winter.”

He thanked her and meant it. She told him politely to mind his step. He promised to step only on his own mistakes. As he moved away, he put a hand in his pocket and felt the note again, the absurd animal he had adopted. It had lost none of its demand by becoming yesterday’s.

Back in town, the sky had gone the soft metal you get in late afternoon when people start deciding what to forgive themselves for. He parked, thinking of the yard, of the word temporary, of the fact that warmth had a schedule and the schedule did not belong to the council. He decided to be useful in a way that felt like work. He drove to an industrial estate on the edge where skip firms and sign makers and a man who could fix any type of boat if you could get it to Crawley lined up like a row of jokes. RALPH’S SKIPS had a bulldog on its sign that was meant to look loyal and looked instead like a dog with a headache and a badge. Ralph himself had a hand like a shovel and a face like a union meeting.

“Infinite?” Ralph said, when asked, and scratched his head in a way that made Nils think of an old record’s hiss between tracks. “They’re the new lads with a social media officer, right? Put pictures up of themselves turning telly guts into art and charging people twenty quid for a lamp what looks like a crime scene. They use us sometimes. Small jobs. Big ambitions. Blokes with tattoos to match their company name, which is a level of commitment I don’t see with my own lads and our bulldog.”

“Do they do jobs they don’t put on Instagram,” Nils asked, and Ralph gave him a look that said, do you want me to write it down.

“Everyone does jobs they don’t put on Instagram,” he said. “I’m not the police. I put the bin where you say, I take it away when you say, I charge you what both our grandfathers would have called a fee and what my son calls exposure if you tag us. They don’t want council boys sniffing if there’s lumpy stuff in the mix, so they’re tidy; I’ll give them that. The one with the cloves is Colin. The girl is—god, the girl, she reminds me of my niece who could rewire her whole bedroom before tea. Deena, yeah. She does the books because the men think numbers are girls’ work until they realise numbers are the only thing that keep vans moving.”

Nils felt a small disgraceful swell of relief at the information reshuffling into pattern. He asked for nothing else but took with him the fact of names and the weight of them. He drove back through a light that had decided to be nice to faces and wondered if it was possible to solve a dragon with an invoice.

Rowan texted him a picture of Mr. Tipsy sitting on a book about medieval saints with the caption YOUR COMPETITION. He sent back a picture of his bandaged hand with the caption I TOO AM A RELIC. She wrote: idiot, and then: come by before we close? He thumbed a yes without looking because his hand knew the letters of yes the way a pianist knows C.

By the time he got there, the shadow had made the shop gentler. Rowan was counting the till, and it had that air of ceremony that money gets when it has been asked to stand still and be counted. He leaned against the shelf where botany went to meet romance and let the particular warmth of her fill in the gaps the day had left.

“You’re hurt,” she said, and took his hand with the authority of someone borrowing it to write a note. “Don’t make me put margarine on it. Maggie told me once that in her childhood that’s what you did if someone burned themselves, and I don’t want to see you lubricated.”

“It kissed me,” he said, and she looked as if he’d said a sentence that had several meanings and she was obliging enough to choose the safest. He told her about Tamsin, about Tegan the ranger, about the schedule of warmth and the way it felt like a radiator pretending innocence. He left Din—Deena—unspoken because you could light your coat on fire and some days you don’t.

She listened with her sleeves pushed up and her mouth arranged in its neatest listening position. When he’d finished, she poured him a glass of water as if to prove that some things were still in the sane column and then said, “Infinite Reclamation are not good at changing a tenner, and they still owe me for one of those magazine bundles. That’s not a crime, but it’s a personality.’

“You’re implying something,” he said, pleased that she had done so and that he got to be the one who told her she had done so.

“I’m implying that the story they’ll sell is the story the town thinks it wants. Not to get funding—that’s the council’s game. To get attention,” she said. “They’re in love with the idea of being in the paper without being mentioned in the bit where they frown outside the magistrates’. If they can write dragon on something and have it come back to them as a crowd, they will. Meanwhile, if they’ve found a business model under the chalk, they will not want a man with a notebook and a moral compass that buzzes to come and be inconvenient.”

“You make me sound better than I am,” he said, because he wanted to hear her do it again.

“That’s what you pay me for,” she said, and smiled the kind of smile that made you feel like you could write a light into the wall. She reached up and touched the place on his wrist that had reddened and then moved her hand away and fiddled with the corner of a receipt as if that had been the point all along. “Maggie rang. She said to tell you that your father’s ghost has stopped moving the turmeric and has started rearranging the sugar. She’s very proud of your haunting.”

“He always was a sweetener,” Nils said, and felt for a second the clean ache of being a child in a warm kitchen with someone who was trying very hard not to let worry occupy a chair of its own. He stood in the shop until the last customer finished browsing like it was a duty and left with a paperback and a sense of having made a decision. He helped Rowan stack chairs that did not need stacking and wiped down a table that would have been fine if left to its own devices. He didn’t kiss her. He could have; the store was empty and the bell on the door was currently asleep. He didn’t, because he had collected all the ways that could go wrong and put them in a jar with a label. He went out into the evening, and it had the scent of wrong weather. He thought: I can be good. He thought: I can also be bad. He thought: tonight, be neither. Tonight, just be the man who goes where people say there is heat and sees whether it is the kind you can invoice.

Night came in gently, a polite visitor. At nine-thirty he parked again near Tilgate and thought about not going in. He thought about the heat spot being content on its own, the tape loving its work, the council memos writing themselves in their sleep. He thought about Dina’s eyes in the alley as if the light had been a decision. He went in. He stepped off the path because he had let himself become a man who does this, and the grass suffered him because it is kind that way.

The fence had gained two new cable ties and the air had gained a smell like someone had cooked a story without a lid. He found the same gap because gaps, once you know them, are like a language you speak without thinking. He went to his belly and wriggled and tried not to remember that last night a man with a sideways infinity had been an inch behind his back. He stood on the other side and let the pit look at him. He listened for the kettle-not-kettle noise and heard it buried under a hush, as if the ground were being careful not to be audible to anyone who hadn’t come with intention.

The vapour was thinner than last night, a thread instead of a hem. He followed it down, slow, feeling with the soles of his shoes for lies. The heat was there, a quiet animal breathing. He crouched and put a hand on the chalk again because he had not learned enough from yesterday’s kiss. The warmth came, held, let go, like a friend demonstrating a hug that did not contain a secret. He put his ear to the ground because he had not lost the part of him that believed the Earth had gossip. A sound like shallow water in a pipe, like a breath being organised, whispered into his skull. He closed his eyes and let himself believe one thing at once. He was about to sit like an idiot and meditate on a hole when the brush behind him coughed a person.

“Don’t move,” said a voice that had decided to be legal, and Nils, who had been very good at disobeying that command for decades, did exactly as he was told because sometimes you drill a different reflex. A torch beam cut the dark into slices. It found him and then had the decency to move to the ground near him. A police officer stepped into view, and the uniform had that newer blue that makes you think of tidy sea. They had a partner; they had the slightly fanned-out stance of people who had been told the world contained surprises and had some of them already.

“We’ve had reports of trespass,” the officer said in a voice that wanted to be your friend and your teacher and your disappointed aunt. “And reports of potential hazards. This counts as both. Name?”

“Nils,” he said, and dug his license out with a care that he hoped read as not trying to impress anybody. “Private investigator. Not a hobbyist famous last words man.”

The officer took the card, let the torch have a bite of it, and returned it with the minimum of theatre. “And what are you investigating, Mr. Andersen?” she asked, and he liked the way she pronounced it with the bits in the right place.

“Heat,” he said. “Rumour. People’s knees when they pretend they’re twenty. A burn on a girl’s hand that looks like it should have had an adult attached to it.”

The second officer, younger and still making peace with the hat, softened a notch because of the phrase about knees. The first looked at the chalk, then at him, then at the vapour that wanted to make a metaphor of itself. “We have instructions to keep people out,” she said. “We have instructions to tell people things are under control. We have practice at telling ourselves the same thing.”

“I will leave and pretend I misread a sign,” Nils said avuncularly, and she almost smirked because sometimes the best thing you can be when you are caught is courteous.

“Leave,” she said, and walked with him to the fence like she was escorting him out of a club he didn’t belong to and didn’t want to. As he wriggled under, she added, in a voice too low for minutes, “My nephew burned his hand here yesterday. I am supposed to say accidents happen. I said those words at my sister’s dining table. They did nothing. Be smarter than accidents.”

He thanked her and meant it in the way you mean something when a stranger hands you a compass. On the path, the tape tried to be important in the breeze and mostly succeeded. The officers stood with the posture of people who had been told there were not enough of them and had decided to be two each. He walked to the car and had the weird, floating feeling of a man who has done nothing wrong within a landscape that has been handing out wrong like flyers.

His phone buzzed with a message from a number he had added and had not allowed himself the comfort of naming. be at the yard at eleven. if you see col don’t say my name. The letters had been typed with a conviction that had been applied over fear like a coat. He checked the time. He could go home, wash his hands, pretend to sleep, come back. Or he could sit in the car and listen to the radio narrate a world that contained none of this.

He drove around for ten minutes so he could pretend he had a life that contained loops. The yard behind the old travel agents had collected the night like it collected everything else. The motion light was late again and made its own joke. He went in, and the sweetness of rotting plums from the overhang had advanced to endearing. Dina materialised between two pallets like she had been built by the dark to illustrate a point.

“You came,” she said, and pushed hair off her face with a motion that had made itself a nervous prayer.

“You said eleven,” he said. “I am an obedient ghost.”

She tucked her chin into her hoodie like a turtle that had learned social niceties. “I’m sorry about last night,” she said. “Col—Colin—he’s got a nose for people. He can smell curiosity and make it pay rent. If he sees you, he’ll decide you’re useful or dangerous. That’s his whole moral scheme. I’m not part of it.”

“He’s on the letterhead with you,” Nils said, because you ought not to accept someone’s story without at least brushing its edges.

“Name on paper doesn’t mean you know where the paper came from,” she said, and there was a old ache in that sentence that made him wish for the gentler version of life that people wrote when they were tired. “We started it together. He had vans. I had hands. He had talk. I had numbers. We both had rent. It got bigger than the part where you can make your own rules and not get on any lists. He saw the pit and saw a brand. I saw the pit and saw a warning label.”

“What is it,” he asked, keeping his voice in the middle of the register where people told you the thing that cost them.

“Sometimes,” she said, “something just old is enough. It doesn’t have to be magic to be dangerous. People throw laptops and batteries and old phones in one place, and something in there remembers how to burn. It burns slow. It burns inwards. You don’t see it until you listen, and then it’s too late. It’s been happening under dumps forever. We’re good at serving our fires snacks. The chalk keeps it like a secret because chalk is a liar that way. It’s old sea. It holds heat like grudges. It’s not just that, though. It’s not just waste. We had a job last month. A bloke who didn’t want to pay to dispose of big stuff. Not bricked up; nothing cinematic. Just… quantities. People think if it isn’t big it isn’t bad. He brought five pallets of old scooter batteries. We thought we could take them apart and sell the cells to boys who like projects. We did. We made money. We also made a pocket in the world that started to behave like it had breath.”

He could feel the shape of the thing now, not as a dragon with a biography but as that other kind of creature—a problem with veins. He pictured the sideways infinity, the Loop that had never planned to include heat. He imagined a fox curious and then cooked. He felt angry in a toned-down way, which was the way that stayed useful.

“Why the myth,” he said. “Why dragon and eggs and steam you can feed to kids. Why not just ‘we have been idiots with lithium’ and then everyone is appropriately dull about it.”

She lifted her hands and dropped them in a gesture that meant both resignation and a kind of stupid respect for the human appetite. “Because you can’t sell hazard. Because if you scare people they call the council and the council calls men in jumpers and then you’re on the radio saying words like compliant. Because fear makes barriers harder and attention makes people climb over them. Colin doesn’t want barriers. He wants a crowd that believes. He wants to hold a torch under a kettle and call it a dragon and have people whisper his name because of it.”

“And you?” he asked.

“I wanted to start a thing that didn’t have rules,” she said, and pushed her sleeve up to scratch at the inside of her wrist where the ink had been, where the infinity had been covered by makeup or time. “Turns out everything cares about rules, even the ground. I told him we had to move the stuff out, that we had to call someone who would make us fill in forms and be ashamed. He said if I called anyone, he’d make my life longer than I could afford. He doesn’t hit,” she added, as if to be fair, because people who had been afraid still wanted to be fair. “He calls people. He knows people. He puts your name in places where names go for long walks.”

“What do you want from me,” Nils said, because that was the animal question and he had to know which way it was going to bite.

“Proof,” she said. “Not the kind you show the paper. The kind you tell the right person and the right person is bored enough to do the job. There’s a van going in at two in the morning. He missed last night because the police wandered the park like they’d finally read one of their memos. Tonight he’s going to try the other entrance.”

“Where,” Nils said, and Dina told him in the particular shorthand of people who know every gap in a fence from a childhood that hadn’t asked permission. He wrote it on his brain because his notebook felt like an insult to the stakes. She gave him a look like an apology folded into a plan.

“Don’t be a hero,” she said. “You don’t have hero shoes. You have the shoes you wear when you go to offices and convince people to hand you their stories. Wear those shoes. Do that thing.”

“I have several shoes,” he said, because an attempt at levity sometimes kept more dangerous things from setting the table. She smiled despite and because and tucked herself into the yard’s shadows like a thought the light didn’t need yet.

He walked back to the car with the feeling that he had been promoted against his will to a job he had not trained for. He drove home and sat on his floor and opened the window because night needed to come in and be a social worker for his head. He set an alarm for one-thirty and lay down fully clothed like someone partway between a sleepover and a stakeout. He did not sleep, but he conducted a mostly successful imitation—eyes closed, body agreeing to pretend. When the alarm called itself helpful, he stood, washed his face like he was asking it to remember him, and put on the darker jacket not because of illegality but because if you’re going to look silly you ought not to do it in beige.

The road to Tilgate at that hour belonged to taxis, foxes, and the kind of men who have a fight with themselves at a bus stop and win. He parked two streets away and went in on foot, choosing the path with the least opinion of him. He did not use a torch because his eyes had always been better at wanting than most people’s. The air had found a new sweetness, a spring note that made him want to believe in simple centuries. At the top of the slope, by the maintenance track that only looked like a maintenance track to people who maintain, he crouched and waited.

It took twenty minutes for the van. He heard it first, tyres careful, engine cheap. The lights were off until the last turn, then on just enough to bully the shadows. It had the kind of siding that claimed to be white when it was feeling confident. He could see the driver’s silhouette, narrow, intent, with the forward lean of a man who trusted wheels more than feet. Another shadow moved in the passenger seat; smoke drifted out of the window like an old habit. The van slowed at the gate that was only a gate if you were paying it, and then, with a precision that told him this was practice, it nudged the cable ties like a friend and opened a mouth you could drive through if you were determined enough to believe in your own rightness.

He moved when they moved. He kept to the right because right had more cover, and he had learned that cover is less about what is there and more about where the eyes are not. He followed too closely and not enough, the old dance where your heart wants to be in the backseat and your brain wants to go home. The van stopped by the dip, where the ground had warmed itself into a character. The men got out: Colin and the hungry one, which meant Dina had a clock in her head that told time by people.

They worked with the quiet of men who had been taught never to be the loudest thing in a problem. They unloaded crates that had those plastic sides you can see through and pretend you cannot. Inside, battery cells slept like loaves of bread, end to end, a ridiculous domesticity for something that liked to burn. They carried them to a particular edge and lowered them into a space the earth had not offered but now held. Steam rose like something impatient at being asked to wait. Nils saw the moment the heat met the thing and the thing learned new information and shared it quickly. He saw Colin flinch in a way he didn’t intend. He saw Hungry grin like a boy who’d put a penny on a railway track and then heard the world answer.

Nils brought out his phone and took three pictures with the ringer off and that small click of satisfaction that came with getting anything right happened in his chest. He recorded ten seconds of sound because some nights you have to become your own radio. He put the phone away not because he was finished but because he knew greed when it leaned forward to shake his hand.

A twig betrayed him because twigs have their loyalties. Colin and Hungry turned together; the torch beam came up in a neat arc that had announced itself in other alleys before. Nils did not run because men like him do not run well in a straight line in the dark. He put his hands up slowly and stepped into their light like a confession.

“Evening,” he said, as politely as the night allowed. “Terrible hour for birdwatching.”

Hungry started forward. Colin didn’t move because he had understood, belatedly, that there were three chairs in this conversation and he needed to decide whether he was going to sit in two of them. He flicked his cigarette into the dirt and watched it argue with the warmth and lose. He walked closer with the smile of a man who has learned he can buy quiet and enjoys haggling.

“How much,” he said.

“You’re going to have to be specific,” Nils said. “Are we talking about my dignity or your future.”

“Your phone,” Colin said, not looking at the phone, which was how you looked at things when you expected to have them in two minutes. “Then the rest. You’re clever enough to be tedious, but not clever enough to be tedious and safe.”

“You put things in the ground that do not belong there,” Nils said, because sometimes you have to do the sentence even if it is not going to get you a drink. “You tell children there’s a dragon so you can call it a story when it hurts them. You put your mark on this with ink, and then you pretend you don’t know what the symbol means.”

“The symbol means a business that never ends,” Colin said with a flash of teeth that did not belong to animals. “And children put their hands where they shouldn’t. You can weep for them when you’re writing your invoice. The ground eats everything. We’re just giving it something with calories.”

Hungry had come close enough now for the infinity on his hand to shimmer a little with sweat. He reached for Nils’s pocket because that is what hands do when they have been told to unmake a man. Nils turned with an economy learned in a different part of his life; he let the hand pass and put his own on Hungry’s wrist, not cruel, just decisive. He did not hurt him because he needed the future not to contain revenge. He let go first because he wanted to teach the lesson about who was making these decisions.

“You don’t have to hurt anyone,” Nils said to Colin, because sometimes telling a man what he doesn’t have to do resets the part of him that had decided to do it. “You can reverse a van. You can drive to Brighton and be a man who sells lamps made out of old computers to people with long hallways. You can stop pretending the ground owes you secrecy.”

Colin snorted a laugh from the back of his throat where he kept his unused affections. “I used to be you,” he said. “Then I had a year when nothing that was owed arrived. Then I became me. This is me. Business in an old town with old ethics. The ethics make everyone feel nice. The business pays for things.” He held out a hand, palm up, like a saint asking for alms. “Hand me your clever, spying thing. Then walk away. Don’t turn into a story, because stories become statements, and those become evidence, and evidence becomes time. You look terrible in time.”

Nils weighed the phone in his pocket in a gesture that did no good except to make his hand busy. He almost said he’d send them the pictures for their Christmas cards. He almost said he’d already sent them to a cloud shaped like a barrister with his hair on fire. He said neither. A light fell on all of them then, not the torch’s temperate cone but a broader, angrier plane. Another vehicle had pulled up on the path; another pair of doors had opened; another kind of authority had entered the room.

“Hands where I can see them,” called a voice that was familiar only because it loved being heard. The police had decided to graduate from polite to present. The officer from earlier walked into the scene with her partner, and their faces said that tonight they were going to spend extra budget on paperwork.

Colin hissed air through his teeth, and in that sibilant sound was everything. He dropped his hands, then raised them, then put them on his head like a fashion shoot for bad decisions. Hungry’s eyes flipped between fight and flight like a coin in a fountain. Nils lifted his hands again because that seemed to be the trend and turned his face to the officer he had promised to be a better person for.

“Good evening,” he said, because he could not help himself. “I swear to God I came for the folklore.”

“I swear to God I’m tired,” she said, and her grin had an edge he respected. She looked at Colin, looked at the crates, looked at the vapour making itself a question. “You’re under arrest for depositing controlled waste without a permit, for entering a restricted area, and for being extremely tedious,” she added, and Nils loved her then, just for the last clause. “You have the right to remain silent. If you are already doing that, please continue on that exciting path.”

Everything after that was choreography. The officers did what officers do when they are both overworked and grateful for an opportunity to be unambiguous. Colin held himself like a man on the cusp of a monologue and then didn’t do the monologue because someone had once told him he could look dangerous if he just kept his mouth shut. Hungry practiced his disaffected stare and got an A minus. Nils stood with his hands in the night and let the relief wash through him like a hot tap coming back after an outage.

He did not see Dina. He looked and did not see her, which was an absence with the shape of a warning. He kept his mouth shut about her because he had decided which part of himself he was going to exercise this week, and it was not the part that threw people under vans. He let the officers take his name and his statement and the story he told had enough truth in it to stand and enough omissions to be kind. He let them tell him to go home. He did as he was told, and it felt, briefly, like a skill.

Back in his flat, the radiator ticked as if applauding his attempt at being useful. He sat on the edge of his bed and looked at his hand and then at the ceiling and then at the idea that a town could contain dragons and skip companies and people you loved so much you had to be grown about it. He lay down and watched the kind of tired that arrives late and has to be coaxed like a pet out from under the sofa. His phone buzzed one last time in the dark. It said: thank you, and that was all. He didn’t know if it was Dina or someone kinder, and he decided not to look for a full minute because sometimes you let the word do its work without asking it for identification. He slept then, into a dream where chalk was warm for ordinary reasons and Mr. Tipsy sat on a dragon’s head like a trophy that had decided whom it belonged to.Morning came in like it had been told off by night and wanted to make amends with light and an apology of blue. Nils woke with the kind of tired that sits politely in a chair in the corner of the room and insists it’s already leaving, then stays for breakfast. The radiator clicked like it had opinions. He went to the window and watched a pair of crows argue with a gull over a chip carton that contained only the memory of salt. It steadied him; petty squabbles were proof of civilization. His phone, which he had left face down on the table like a misbehaving child, performed the small opera of notifications. He made coffee first, because that was his boundary with the world’s demands, and then thumbed through the litany: a message from Rowan with a link—Local men arrested in Tilgate Park over illegal dumping, council warns public to avoid fenced areas—an email from the officer with the measured vowels asking if he would please forward the images and audio he had mentioned, three missed calls from a number he didn’t know that he recognised as the solicitor’s tone even in digits, and a string of town Facebook group screenshots forwarded by Maggie that were a perfection of small-town madness.

He sent the photos. He sent the ten seconds of audio that had captured the pipe-breathing sound and the way men do a certain kind of breathing when they are pretending to find everything normal. He wrote back to the officer with his thanks and a sentence about how the vapour had appeared less thick at ten than it had at two, and he added an apology for sounding like he was describing soup. He read the town group out loud to the kettle because it deserved performance: “Why are they arresting people for helping the dragon keep warm,” followed by, “My cousin says the dragon is a metaphor for gas prices,” followed by one woman who had seen the Taylor report in a different decade and now saw cover-ups everywhere. Maggie had added no commentary, just a heart and a skull, which meant she had laughed bleakly and then stopped.

Rowan’s link had a picture of the pit you could not see and the tape that tried to be the main character. The article used the phrase illegal deposit of controlled waste and the words Environment Agency and the quotation marks around the word dragon as if the myth were being held with two fingers at arm’s length. There was a comment from a councillor that tried hard to say everything and ended up saying, essentially, please do not climb fences. He scrolled language like a man rolling marbles he could not use in his pocket. He typed to Rowan: I promise I did not get arrested for trespass and folklore. She replied in the time it takes to remove a sarcastic expression from a face: Maggie rang at eight and told me to tell you she knows you were out because the ghost was quiet. If you do anything else behind tape, send me a text beforehand so I can prepare my mourning cardigan.

He put down the phone and let himself laugh where no one could be insulted by it. The laugh had an edge of something he did not unbox. He showered, dressed, cursed the existence of socks, and walked to Paper Lantern because the world was better when he had a pastry in his immediate future. The bell complained and then forgave him. Mr. Tipsy eyed him with suspicion as deep as three lifetimes, then decided he was not worth moving for. Rowan wore her morning competence like a borrowed blazer; she poured two coffees, handed him one, and then made a face when she saw the corner of his bandage.

“You told me you were careful and then you went and made your hand into a ham,” she said, and touched his wrist with exactly enough pressure to make him aware of every heartbeat. He told her he had been kissed by geology and malfeasance and that he had, in a limited way, enjoyed the attention. She snorted and set a croissant on a plate like she was arresting it. “They’ve put out a call for volunteers to come and be present around the pit. The council says no, naturally, but the Ranger Volunteer group says yes, with clipboards and stern expressions. Tegan was in for a tea and a lemon drizzle when we opened. She said if she sees another teenage boy in a North Face trying to climb with his phone in his back pocket she’ll set the geese on them like ancient Roman punishment.”

“I’ll sign up to write down names and tell small plausible lies about geology,” he said, and he meant it in a way that surprised him. He could picture himself on a path with a lanyard and a pen that didn’t work, directing kids back to prudence with humour and the odd threat of embarrassment. Rowan watched his face arrange itself into that picture and her own softened because she loved watching him find uses for his edges. “The police want my pictures,” he added, and her look did that small flicker that meant she was thinking three moves forward.

“Send them,” she said. “Then make copies and put the copies in eight different clouds, one of which is Rebecca at the solicitor’s who has hands that could juggle kitchen knives and a filing system that could shame NASA. She came in before nine and bought two romances and asked if anyone sensible had been in. I told her you were on your way and she made a noise like a bulldog being politely satisfied.”

He texted Rebecca whose surname was one of those sleek things that sounded like it should be a brand of shoes. She responded with a brisk yes and a coffee emoji and then rang to tell him in straight lines what he already knew, which was that he had done all the good things and should do three more that involved backups and that if any gentleman with a sideways eight turned out to be on bail and came to have a conversation about deleted files, he should, quite frankly, not be there. He told her he was practicing not being in rooms with men who liked cloves. She told him to practice harder.

The day was honest about its brightness. The town turned its gossip into weather and its weather into gossip and Nils went about his incidental chores with the attention paid to small tasks that people reserve for days when larger tasks vibrate like bees in a jar at the edge of thought. He collected a set of keys from a woman with a haircut that said New Start and wrote on his pad a note to self about the missing husband case that had been shoved to one side by fire pretending to be folklore. He called Harjit to confirm the laptop had been recovered; Harjit’s laugh was the reluctant one of a man who had been made to be decent against his will. He walked across Queen’s Square and watched two boys play an earnest game of football with a plastic bottle and thought for the hundredth time that invention was not the same as luck. At the fountain, which remained theatrical about not working, he saw Dina sitting on the edge in a posture that made him want to walk past and not call her name in case her name had learned to hurt.

He didn’t call. He sat on the opposite end and was the kind of obvious you are allowed to be in daylight, which is to say present but not official. She came over because some people are built that way; they lean towards the thing that scares them if they think they can bite it before it bites them. Her hoodie was clean, which meant she had decided this morning to perform a version of herself that didn’t look like the yard. The makeup over the place where the tattoo had been was more meticulous, which meant she had needed a mirror and time.

“He’s out,” she said without preface and without raising her eyes from her trainers. “On his way out he told the officer to smile more, so I think karma will be doing push-ups today, but he’s out. They took the van. He’ll get another van. He has a friend with a yard in Copthorne and a friend with a lock-up in Horley and a friend who can remember how to spell the words you put on forms that make you sound like a cooperative of ocean clean-up volunteers.”

“You shouldn’t be here if here is where you don’t feel safe,” Nils said, and then regretted the phrasing because it sounded like a brochure for common sense, which never saved anyone. He softened it with, “Do you want somewhere to be this afternoon that is not the yard and not your aunt’s kitchen table where she will cut you cake and tell you in the voice she uses for sadness that you are very good at numbers.”

“I want somewhere to be that is not a plan,” she said, and it broke him a little, the way the words sat. “I did a stupid thing and a brave thing and probably the wrong thing. I told someone what someone was doing, and now the someone is free to do what he does and the someone I told has to fill out forms and act like it’s a tiny corner of the world not a whole one. I don’t want to go to London. I don’t want to go to Devon. I don’t even want to go to Brighton and come back with a nose ring and a story about a night bus. I want to be here and not be on the letterhead of a mistake.”

“You can keep a thing from being the only line on your sheet,” he said, and it sounded like he’d practiced it in the shower, except he hadn’t, he had practiced it in his head without admitting it. “I can talk to Rebecca and to Tegan and to one of the councillors who owes me two favours and a parking exemption. Between them, they can build a little bridge for you to cross that does not collapse when your uncle in Crawley Down says something unhelpful on Facebook under a fake name. Also, Rowan has more boxes in her back room than a sensible person should, and she is an idiot about giving people shifts they can use to stand up straight again. I can facilitate. It is one of my few verbs.”

Dina looked up at that because the word facilitate had been a word her college tutor had used and she liked seeing it reclaimed by a man who wore bruises from chalk on his coat. “He’s going to say I squealed,” she said, and there was nothing of caricature in it; it was bald. “He’s going to say the police came because of me, and he won’t say it to me because that would be legal, he’ll say it to people who will say it to people who talk to my aunt at the pharmacy.”

“Then change the geography,” Nils said, and he thought of Maggie and her lamb and her cigarettes and a spare room that sometimes contained cousins and sometimes contained plants. “There is a house where the ghost is polite and the tea is militantly hot and the woman who lives there insists you call her Maggie even if you are eighty. There is also a bookshop with a cat who likes to sleep on people who need to stay still. There are many chairs not in the yard. Let’s choose one.”

Her mouth did a little thing like the shape of a laugh but without the sound. “Don’t be a hero,” she said, repeating herself like a charm. “Heroes are terrible to live with. They leave their dishes to soak. They make the worst tea.”

“I am too lazy to be a hero,” he said. “But I am very good at washing cups.” He stood, and she stood, and they walked like ordinary people across a square that was trying to be a foreign plaza and managing an English attempt at it. At Paper Lantern he did not make a show; he led her to a side table and told Rowan only with his eyebrows that this was a person on the way between. Rowan fed Dina, because feeding was one of the shop’s services that did not appear on the board, and she asked no penetrating questions. She told her instead that the poetry shelf had decided to be insubordinate and whether Dina would be kind enough to help her re-order it by colour, which riled a librarian somewhere and yet had the joy of work and play at once. Dina had small hands that knew how to hold fragile things. She moved books like she was adjusting the light.

The town, which had decided to turn its rumour into a day trip, sent people in for coffee with dragon-shaped confessions. A man declared in a cheerful tone that he knew for a fact that an egg had been found and that it was in a freezer at a fish and chip shop. A woman who had gone to school with Rowan’s aunt said not that she had been told by someone she trusted but that she had a feeling in her waters, a phrase that meant both “I am certain” and “I want company in my certainty.” Nils excused himself from this theatre with a smile and took his coffee across to the window where he could watch both the street and Rowan’s profile and pretend he was only deep when he had to be.

His phone rang with a number he recognised as the officer’s, and he stepped outside into the lap of light. Her voice carried the slight exhaustion of a person who had filled more boxes than anyone could sensibly ask. She told him, sparely, that Colin had indeed been released pending further investigation and that the charges would be more administrative than heroic, which annoyed her even as she said it. She told him the Environment Agency had asked for his footage, and he had already sent it, and he enjoyed the mild bureaucratic perfection of being ahead. He asked her for her name this time because a gratitude needed a label, and she said, “Lewis,” after a pause like a small test, and he told her he was glad to know which syllables to attach to the kindness.

He spent the next hour useful in thirty-second increments: a text to Rebecca with Dina’s first name only and the request for a list of charities that didn’t ask young women to prove they deserved a second chance; a message to Tegan asking whether the volunteer rota needed stubborn men in drab coats; a voicemail to the councillor with the parking exemption reminding him that this was the kind of time when he could make a page in his next pamphlet true rather than shiny. He felt for a while like a switchboard rather than a person, and then Rowan put a hand briefly at the small of his back as she passed him with a tray, and he remembered a human was a thing as well as a function.

By mid-afternoon the story had advanced two inches and then dallied. A boy posted a video of steam and music and cut it so the breath sounded like a chorus; it got eight thousand views by tea. Tegan sent him a picture of a little knot of grandmothers with clipboards who had stationed themselves by the fence like patrons of a restaurant telling the waiter the salt was too forward. A woman came into the shop with her dog, which was a cloud on legs, and told Rowan very seriously that if they found a dragon, her Alfie would take it for a walk. The sunshine had that persistent quality that made people forgive each other for a minor debt. He wanted to sit down and be ordinary and he also wanted to see if the thermal patch had moved because his brain had grown fond of the perplexity.

Instead, by some unholy alchemy known to towns, he became the person you told a different problem to because you had seen him put his hands on other problems and not flinch. Stuart Keene came in with Tamsin, who held her bandage like a bouquet, and they said thank you because politeness and gratitude are different animals and some days you hunt both. Then a woman named Kyla who ran the kebab shop three doors down pulled him into the alley to show him a bag of lithium batteries that someone had left in her recycling like they had been putting out bread for ducks. He moved them to a safer container with the delicacy of someone reducing his chances of blowing a hole in his leg and called the council line and left a message in his best professional voice, and it felt like a day he would be too tired to narrate later and too wired to forget.

Dina worked in the corner and made the poetry shelf behave in ways that would upset poets. Rowan fed her, not like a charity but like a friend, and when it grew dark enough that the shop’s lights looked like intention rather than habit, she came over and said in a careful voice that she would go to her aunt’s for tonight and say nothing to anyone she didn’t trust and possibly take a bus somewhere with a map tomorrow if things were worse. Nils told her a sentence that felt pompous in his mouth and true anyway, which was that she should ring him if the ground under her feet felt like a lie. She rolled her eyes without malice and said that middle-aged men loved a metaphor. She left by the back door that had a cat flap and a sign that said Please Close Me Like I Matter.

As evening turned the shop to amber, Maggie rang because perhaps nights were where worry lived and would not be ignored. She asked him if he was thinking of coming round for leftovers and a lecture. He said yes, because there are days when the only thing keeping a man together is lamb reheated and a kitchen where someone believes hard in his softness. When he arrived, the house smelled like story and cumin. She made him sit and eat; she poured him a glass of wine that had been allowed to breathe; she squinted at his hand and tutted as if tutting were antiseptic. He told her as much as he wanted to of the night by the pit, which was a little less than the true, and she let him leave pockets untouched because her love was not nosy.

“They’re going to have a vigil,” she said, putting plates in the sink with the solemnity of conclusion. “Not for a dragon. For attention, I think. Someone’s made a poster with lanterns and a sketch of something that looks like the logo of a B&B. I don’t love people in the dark with candles near the place where the ground had to be told what to do. If you go, put your common sense in front of you like a shield.”

“I thought you distrusted common sense,” he said, and nicked a bit of lamb from the dish with the unfair speed of a childhood expert.

“I distrust the way people use common sense to justify telling other people not to try things,” she said, and lit a cigarette like it was a prop in a play she had rehearsed. “But I trust the small, everyday kind that says don’t touch the hot bit and don’t walk into rooms you wouldn’t take your mother.” She blew smoke at the ceiling, then, gentle, added, “Bring Rowan Sunday for lunch. I made too much judgment and it needs to be diluted with someone with a kinder mouth.”

He left Maggie’s with heat inside him that was not geothermal. He walked past hedges that knew secrets and a cat that refused to explain itself and a pair of teenagers arguing in low, intense tones about a band and whether the band was a band or a religion. He drove back into town with the windows down because the air smelled like people choosing not to be cross. At Paper Lantern, the lights were lower; the chairs were mostly upside down on tables; Mr. Tipsy had chosen the atlas as his throne. Rowan counted the till and hummed a song that had no words and then stopped when the door opened because the bell did its duty.

They had the shop to themselves for a minute that decided to expand and become five. He told her about the vigil; she had already seen the poster because of course she had; she had an opinion about candles and tape and teenagers and the way symbols attract people like moths to, well, things that promise more than light. He told her about Dina’s afternoon; Rowan told him gently what she would and would not do as a person who ran a place that looked, on paper, like a sanctuary and in practice like a juggle. She would give Dina shifts. She would not pretend to be a lock. She would ask Tegan for a list of volunteer hours, then bully Tegan into drinking water and sleeping. He watched her and his chest hurt with the effort of not being bad at love.

It would have been a good night to go home and be simple. Instead, at ten, his phone lit with a number that claimed nothing and delivered a recorded message that had the gall of automation and the content of trouble. It was the council’s alert system, for people who had signed up to be citizens with inboxes, and it stated in a voice that had been designed in a room without laughter that due to public interest and safety concerns, Tilgate Park would be closed from ten until six, and that anyone near the east path should move towards the car park now, and that there would be increased presence from the police and the Environmental Agency, and that residents were advised not to gather near taped areas to watch potential activity. In the background of the recording was the sound of somebody saying the word dragon and somebody else saying the word optics, which made the whole thing feel like a joke about modern life none of them had signed up to.

He looked at Rowan. She looked at him. The look did not need translation. He said that he was not going to go and stick his hand in a hole anymore. She said that she believed him in the way a mother believes her toddler when he promises not to eat the crayon. He said he would take a loop around by the fence and then come back and help her put away the poetry because it had gotten restless. She said to text her every ten minutes with a picture of something boring like his own shoes. He said he would photograph the pavement until she begged him to stop. They stood for a second longer than necessary because the door was a threshold and thresholds are ceremonies disguised as convenience.

At the park the tape had a new gleam in the streetlights and a shine of intention that tape rarely deserved. The path glittered where grit had given up its dust. The fence made its dull music in the wind. Tegan stood with a group of volunteers in jackets that were bright enough to admit themselves guilty in the dark. She came to him without preamble and said that the closure was both sensible and an invitation, that she had already told three boys to stop pretending their vape clouds were evidence, and that she had a spare high-vis if he wanted to cos-play as a functioning member of society. He took the jacket because sometimes putting on bright yellow helped you behave like you had read the manual. He stood with them and watched the gathered, which included an influencer with a ring light and two women who were prayerful and intensely practical about it and three men who wanted to argue with anyone and did not much care who.

A commotion at the far end moved through the crowd like gossip. Nils saw the wavering glow of lanterns, the old-fashioned paper kind, carried by a handful of people who had decided the flyer needed to be behaved into being despite the closure. The lanterns looked innocent until you imagined them dipping towards the warm spots. Tegan said sharply that this was not literally medieval and that if anyone set fire to the bracken, she would make them pick individual ash from individual blades of grass until morning. The police moved with a confidence that was ninety percent stance and ten percent authority. Officer Lewis was there, and she saw him seeing her and did not look surprised because she had recalibrated her expectations of his judgement last night and had the note on her internal file: polite, curious, stubborn, useful when pointed.

Colin was not there. That fact asserted itself like a half-missing tooth. Hungry was there, or a boy very like him, in a hoodie that made him look generic and a smirk that made him not. He wore his infinity unhidden as if to dare the world not to be literate. He kept his mouth shut because finally someone had taught him that the short term had value. Nils did not approach him because he had chosen not to make certain enemies work harder than necessary.

The lanterns wavered like low-ambition stars. Tegan lifted both arms and made the universal sign for this is now ridiculous. The officer in charge, who was not Lewis, moved forward and spoke in a reasonable tone. Words were exchanged, some chippy, some apologetic, some soaked in the kind of righteousness that arrives when you give yourself a job like guardian of myth and nobody else has signed the contract. Then, because towns can be sane in spite of themselves, the lanterns turned back towards the car park as if they were migratory and the crowd breathed out like a creature that had been holding.

It was after that, in the quiet that happens when drama has been averted and boredom wants to reassert dominion, that the ground did a thing. It was not dramatic. It did not roar or crack. It exhaled differently, a long, low warmth that came up through shoe soles and into ankles and made everyone adjust their feet as if they had been standing too long at a wedding. A murmur went through the group because people are herd animals with excellent legs. A woman said in reverence, oh. A man said in fear, oh. Nils felt his knee ache in exactly the same way it did before rain and thought that his body had always been ahead of him.

Officer Lewis measured the air like it would respect her for it. Tegan stepped to the tape and put a hand on a post as if she were asking the fence to be brave with her. Someone at the back started to clap for no reason and stopped when it was clear that their own sound had embarrassed them. Nils took out his phone and did a small, sneaky thing: he started a stopwatch. He wanted to know how long the warm wave took to come and go, because some pattern deep inside him needed a number to break into and sit down.

It lasted three minutes, a patient, sustained bath of not-unpleasant that was nevertheless wrong. Then it faltered and returned to the quieter hummed temperature. He stopped the watch and wrote the number on his brain and then in his notes because he had learned the hard way that brains resent being used as filing cabinets. He sent Rowan a picture of his shoes like an obedient idiot and she replied with a picture of Mr. Tipsy’s paw with the caption I WIN and that helped.

When he turned away from the fence, he saw a man on the far side of the path who did not belong for reasons that did not reduce easily to a list. He had the careful hair of a person who had hired someone to remember how he looked, and the coat of a person who, when he bought a coat, said the words investment piece as if he knew what money would do for him in ten years, and he held himself like he used to make a living persuading people he was harmless. He saw Nils and, with the social grace of someone whose parents had taught him to use fear as a fork, smiled.

“You’re Andersen,” the man said when Nils came within conversational distance because of course Nils came within conversational distance; he was built to. “People say you are sometimes on the wrong side of the tape. People say you are useful until you are a nuisance. I like people who are useful. I like people who think they are a nuisance. It means they know where their edge is.”

“It’s a small town,” Nils said, and kept his hands in his pockets because he was not yet sure whether the point was to look relaxed or to respect the fact that his fingers did poorly under stress.

“My name is Gregor Vale,” the man said, and the name came with the soft thud of a card on a table. He didn’t offer a card; he let the air hold the syllables like a caller announces himself on a radio program everyone pretends not to listen to. “I sit on four boards you’ve never heard of because you do interesting work all day and don’t read the business pages at breakfast. I care about this park for reasons that are simultaneously philanthropic and selfish. The selfish reason is that houses near parks people want to be in are worth more than houses near parks that smell like electrical fires. The philanthropic reason is that children should be able to put their hands on the ground without the ground being petty. I do not like the men you upset last night. I do not like them because they have no imagination. I do not like them because they confuse a legend with a license. I would like to pay you to be on the right side of the tape in the wrong way for a week.”

Nils smiled in spite of the instincts that wrote alternative endings on napkins at times like these. “Succinct,” he said, and the man’s face did the slightest shrug. “What do you want, Mr. Vale, besides to keep the smell of battery heat out of your net worth.”

“A report,” Vale said, and he did not shift his posture because men with this kind of money learned that stillness looked like the threat of a cat. “A list. Who is dumping what, where, how many pallets at a time, which lockups they touch when they think nobody is looking, which friend owes which favour that will go stale if held under the light. Names if you can get them. Skills if you can’t. If there is a second group with a better story, tell me that. If there are council weak points, tell me that too. I will take your report and I will take it to places that will not put it in a drawer. I will not ask you to lie. I will ask you not to make a moral out of every paragraph.”

“I charge in cash,” Nils said because you do not let a man talk money until you have said a small thing that sounds like a boundary even if it is not. “I put my rates on paper with lines. I say no if I think you think you own me. I walk away if I am told to risk people who are not paid. And, Mr. Vale, I will make a moral in some paragraphs, because I am built that way and because towns are. If you can live with that, I can do a week.”

“Good,” Vale said, and produced a card after all, because a man like that cannot resist props. The card was heavy in the way of small doors. “Call me in the morning and tell me you are saying yes. Do not call me tonight. I am going to go home and pretend that my wife’s documentary is more important than the ground in my town being a child.” He smiled without heat, turned, and walked away like a very good advertisement for shoes.

Nils put the card in his wallet with the dry irritation of a person aware he was going to use it. He stood with Tegan and her clipboards for another twenty minutes and helped an old man find his way back to the car park because the dark had done that trick of rearranging landmarks. He sent Rowan a final photograph of his ridiculous shoes and the caption I HAVE BEEN BORING and she sent back a sticker of a gold star and the word liar. He took off the high-vis and stood for a second in his own coat like he was remembering where his edges were.

On the way back to his car a shadow moved where a shadow needn’t. He stopped in that very specific way you stop when you have spent too much of your life stepping forward into things that swing. Dina didn’t step out. She was better than that. She let him come close and then she spoke from the dark as if the dark was on her side.

“He’ll come for you before he comes for me,” she said and it was not a plea, it was a survey. “He knows his friends are only friends in the same way puddles are lakes, which is to say until the sun does a small hard job. He’ll try to take it out on someone who thinks they can stay in one place. Don’t prove him right.”

“Do you have somewhere to be,” he said, and had to stop himself from offering all his chairs in one sentence.

“I am going to my aunt’s in Gossops,” she said. “Then I am going to sleep like it is a task. Then tomorrow I am going to wipe my resume of all the names it should not have had and I am going to decide what I am called and whether I ever plait my hair again and who gets to have my hands. Then I am going to come back to the shop and move poetry around for a few days in a way that will annoy every person who ever loved an index.” She breathed in and out like a person who had decided not to drown for now. “I’m all right. I am not all right. I will be all right. These can be true at the same time. Go and do your job with the rich man. Don’t be a hero. Don’t be sleazy. Do your thing where you write people down and then make them better by making them ashamed.”

“I don’t have that power,” he said, and she snorted in a way that made the shadow around her roll its eyes.

“You have it more than most,” she said. “Also, your step-sister wants you alive and I like her cardigan, so behave.” She melted away then, or rather she walked with the casual grace of someone who had been seen enough and did not want to be measured again tonight.

He drove home with the window down because the smell of spring would not put itself in a bottle for him later. He put Vale’s card on the table next to his notebook and placed his palm over it like a man deciding whether to press a button. He made notes because they made him better. Infinite Reclamation: assets, vans, friends. Colin: clove habit, smile that thinks it is a tool, temperaments of men who send messages instead of punches. Hungry: young enough to be reached, old enough to have chosen. Yard and lock-ups: Copthorne, Horley, possibly Crawley Down. Council: councillor with exemption and a weakness for profile; Environmental Agency contact through Lewis; Tegan as eyes in the daylight that cannot be bribed. Dina: tomorrow—Rowan—hours—Maggie—tea. He drew a little sideways eight in the margin and then, out of spite or optimism, he drew a line through it and wrote the word finite next to it and grinned at his own joke because if you can’t amuse yourself you have to pay people to.

He sent Rowan a last message that said I am home and I have not set anything on fire, and she sent back a photograph of a tea towel with a pattern of dragons and the words you are missing out and she would tell him in the morning how Mr. Tipsy had knocked over a stack of self-help books like a metaphor. He lay down, and this time sleep came without argument. In his dream he was at the chalk pit again, but the vapour was coming from kettles boiling on long tables and people were making tea for each other while a line of geese patrolled with lanyards and clipboards and a man with very good shoes was making an apology into a microphone he had forgotten to switch on.

He woke before his alarm because morning had a point it wanted to make and it thought you were the right person to hear it. The town outside was setting out its chairs again and arguing about bins in a reasonable tone and a plane dragged a white underlining across the sky. He went to the window because he always did. He thought about dragons and batteries and men with money and women with clipboards and the way love could sit in a chair like a teenager who has been told to be normal for ten minutes. He put on coffee and told himself a straightforward lie which was that this week would be simple. Then he drank the coffee and put Vale’s card in his pocket and prepared to go out and earn his rent in the only way he knew, which was to put himself where the story happened and be careful with the bits that could cut.Monday arrived dressed as something straightforward, which was considerate of it and deeply untrue. Nils woke with the new habit of listening, as if the heating pipes had gossip they hadn’t told him last week. The flat smelled like the last coffee he’d made and the hairdresser’s below pretending to be a bakery, and for a moment he let himself wonder whether he would call Vale and say no, I intend to sit on fences and make elegies, not invoices. He put the kettle on, because his better self liked to be caffeinated before his cowardice had a say, and by the time steam had put a moustache on the window he had Vale’s card on the table and his phone on speaker while he stretched a muscle in his shoulder that always woke up sulking.

The line picked up with a human and then with Vale, because men like Vale arranged their days like dominoes and hated wasted motion. Vale didn’t say good morning in the way most people did; he folded the words into purpose, which made them heavier and somehow less annoying. He outlined a retainer as if he were drawing a neat rectangle in the air for Nils to sit in, and Nils countered with the rectangles he could tolerate, each with little side doors labelled I walk away if and I will not. They agreed to a week and the number that made rent plus the sort of lunch that made the day feel like a character. Vale offered to send a non-disclosure agreement that had obviously been drafted by someone with a taste for adjectives, and Nils said he would sign nothing that asked him to lie by omission later. Vale laughed like a man who had paid for a laugh to be installed and told him to meet him at an office over a solicitor’s in town for the exchange of an envelope that would be ostentatiously plain. They ended the call with a polite dislike they both found refreshing and useful.

He texted Officer Lewis next, because he had learned, late, to tell the person who might arrest you what you were going to do, in case it stopped you being arrested. She rang back while he put on his jacket and told him in sentences made of the shortest possible words that the Environment Agency had sent a man in a jumper who was the embodiment of patience and that she would prefer if any investigating near the pit was done in a manner that wouldn’t make her fill extra boxes on her forms. He asked whether she minded him looking at the other end of the pipe—the places where vans became rumours—and she said that if he happened to see a registration number and he happened to pass it on, the great engine of the state might move a gear for once and surprise them all. He promised to cultivate happenstance and not to get punched, and she said that punched people were boring on paper and worse in person and then hung up with the briskness of someone who liked to leave on a full stop.

Rebecca, whose voice could slice bread and comfort toddlers in the same paragraph, agreed to see Dina after lunch without making a speech about it and told Nils to bring whatever he had that had names and dates on it. He had the phone photos and the ten-second audio of the pit’s breath, and he had, folded into a pocket, a letterhead that said Infinite Reclamation with a date stamp that had made itself important. He pocketed them without ceremony and, because he had promised to pretend to be sensible in front of Rowan, went to Paper Lantern with the expression of a man who had slept and flossed and would not be crawling under any fences today.

The shop wore Monday better than most places. Someone had left a scarf on a chair like a pet and Mr. Tipsy had decided the till was warm enough to be his territory and was lying with his belly out in a reckless display of trust. Rowan was in the back with a cluster of who might become book group ladies, their voices doing that polite overlapping that meant they were building a raft out of fiction. She saw him, pointed with an eyebrow at a chair she had kept ridiculous with a cushion that said Read Me, then came to him with coffee before he could ask. He told her Vale had a card heavy enough to require a licence and that he was going to use his week to count vans instead of dreams. She said in that very dry voice she had for when he pretended his caution was funny that he should keep a count of his bones as well and that she had put Dina to work not because she liked to turn the shop floor into a social clinic but because two pairs of hands on poetry never did harm unless the Keats arrived and took offence. Dina, hair scraped back, sleeves rolled, made a joke about the alphabet behaving itself for once and refused to look at the place where the infinity had been, which was a refusal with the dignity of a vow.

There was a newspaper on the counter that had given the dragon quotation marks again; Rowan made a face at it like it had used the wrong fork. Nils asked, because sometimes love was giving another person a subject they could do a sentence on, whether she wanted to go to Maggie’s on Sunday, and she said of course in a tone that put soup and gossip and two versions of the same story at the same table. He leaned on the counter and stayed too long until his coffee went tepid, and then he took himself out because not leaving was always a temptation dressed as devotion.

Vale’s office was the kind of place that cost too much because it looked like every other place that costs too much: at the back of a building with a respectable brass plaque and carpets that subdued you with their beige. Vale was waiting in a room that pretended not to know it was meant to intimidate. He handed over the envelope in a motion clean enough to be choreography and talked about deliverables as if Nils were an employee pretending to be an old friend. He didn’t ask for receipts, which Nils noticed and appreciated because it meant he was being paid not to write a novel of expenses. Vale also didn’t flirt with philanthropy; he said straight that his investors had asked questions about whether smells equal headlines and whether headlines equal value, and if that made him sound like every other man who had ever used the word stakeholder like it was a personality trait, then fine. Nils said he would tell him the truth like it was an invoice and Vale inclined his head in that way men of his type had, as if bowing constituted listening. They parted with their dislike still pleasantly intact.

If a man means to follow vans and not be noticed, he has to make peace with being bored in interesting places. The lock-ups at Horley were tucked behind the tattooist and a hand car wash where suds performed optimism in all weathers. Half the units had graffiti that had cost more than their rent; the others had signs that lied about what was inside in fonts that had never seen a designer. Nils parked two streets over and walked in along the fence, hands in pockets, the rough neutrality of a man retrieving something boring like a box of Christmas lights in June. He knew the smell of men who did crime without the melodrama, men whose crimes involved paper, weight, and second-hand sweatshirts. He bought a bottle of water from a shop that had nothing but bottles and a man with a calculator, then leaned on a wall and drank it as if thirst were his main occupation. After twenty minutes a white van with ambition and scratches made from having too many opinions pulled into a space near the end, and he saw Hungry get out with the kind of swagger boys practice in windows when they think nobody is looking. The infinity on Hungry’s hand flashed in the sun and then he put it in his pocket like a borrowed ring.

Nils was not stupid enough to go up to him and say, hello, I have taken unflattering photos of you at night; might I see the paperwork that says you are legitimate. He gave the van time to swallow its cargo and then he strolled, as if going nowhere is reason enough, counted off units until he found one with a new padlock and a number whose screws were cleaner than the screws on either side. He pretended to fumble his phone and crouched to pick it up so he could catch in his periphery the mineral smell that haunted e-waste and the shade of black dust that came with breaking things down. He moved on with the little lift to the shoulders you use to look like your day has purpose and then sat in his car with a notebook balanced on the steering wheel and wrote down the registration number, the time, and the way Hungry had looked over his shoulder twice as if expecting a father or a god.

He drove to Copthorne after, following a route that had learned to be smug about not being the M23. The yard there was more informal, which is to say it boasted about its rulelessness with signs that said PRIVATE in a way that made you think of a child guarding a fort. There was a man in a deckchair by the gate reading a magazine about cars that had never been outside in England, and he looked at Nils like people look at the weather app before deciding whether to take a coat. Nils asked in an accent he kept for moments like this whether there was any chance of hiring a corner for the afternoon to unload some rubbish his mate had left him, and the man said that they were full up with lads who used the word recycling like a condom and that anyway the council were sniffing around today because some clown had set a pit on fire by telling kids it was a dragon. They shared the kind of laugh you keep on the shelf with the word bloke and then the man offered a number for someone in Horley who could do him a favour if the favour could be done for cash. Nils took the number and thanked him and left before the small talk had to grow new legs. He had enough to start a list that looked like a map; it made his pulse calm for almost a minute.

Ralph at the skips would never admit to keeping a notebook that had more in it than dates and tonnage, but teasing it out of him at the back of his yard with two coffees and a compliment for the bulldog on the sign might as well have been in the council training manual on dealing with the public. Ralph’s grin went sideways and then down when Nils mentioned registration plates and patterns, and he said in a voice that pretended boredom that some lads booked a skip twice in a week for the same address, which was perhaps just festive or perhaps the address had been inventing the need rapidly. He had a copy of a docket in a drawer that had gotten wet last January and smelled like river and he let Nils glance at it long enough to catch a phone number that had belonged to a man called Grant with a voicemail that sounded like he’d recorded it in a pub car park while faffing with his lighter. Ralph also used a tone of mild theatricality to say that the only thing that got him genuinely riled was heavy stuff hidden under light stuff, and the last time he’d tipped a skip and found scooter battery guts under a duvet he’d had to count backwards from ten in German. Nils said he’d like to hear that once and never again.

At lunch he sat opposite Rebecca as she used a pen to conduct her sentences. Dina sat beside him with her chin up and her mouth stubborn and her eyes doing a tremor that she wished was laughter. Rebecca said words like whistleblower with the caution of a person who knows the law likes to make promises it then confuses, and she outlined in a neat, unconcerned voice what it would look like to give a statement that did not put Dina under the wheels of the wrong van. She told Dina that sometimes the bravest thing is to go still and that if anyone put their hands on her beyond the limits, there were retaliations that did not involve boys in hoodies performing their ideas of masculinity. Dina agreed with the slow nod of a person who had lifted something weighty and decided to put it down later without dropping it on her foot. They left with papers that were unglamorous and a phone number that was the opposite of a myth. Nils liked Rebecca in exactly the way he liked lampposts after midnight: she did not provide romance, but she made the edges kinder.

The park had its own lunchtime. Tegan had acquired an expression she wore when people said the same ridiculous sentence in slightly different ways and expected a different reaction. The geologist had come in his jumper and very practical boots and looked like a good man to have around if your house had decided to tilt during a storm. He spoke to people slowly, not because he thought they were stupid, but because he wanted to be careful and because he liked to watch reassurance do its work. He told a cluster of teenagers and a grandmother with a face that would brook no nonsense that this was probably a sub-surface smoulder encouraged by lithium and old tree roots and the peculiar genius of chalk to behave like a duvet. He said the worst thing to do was to pour water on it in great offended quantities; the second worst was to poke it with a stick; and that the third was to call it a dragon in a way that made people light candles next to it in a county known for winds. He asked whether anyone had found small birds singed and had the relief of hearing no. Tegan gave him tea and a slice of lemon drizzle and then bullied him into sitting down while she told him about funding applications in the voice of a woman who has never lost a form and has never forgiven the office that did.

In the afternoon Nils did the thing he liked least about his job, which was talk about a missing husband with a woman who had fallen in love with him when they were twenty and had now learned that twenty is a language teenagers speak badly. Her name was Anne, and she had the clipped politeness of someone who had grown tired of apologising for occupying space. She had made a cake she hadn’t cut, which said more about hope and denial than any words would have. She told Nils about her husband—his job at a warehouse that had no gossip and a commute that had too much, a friend he had started seeing three-times-a-week rather than twice and who had a dog he had just got, the sound his keys made in the bowl when he had chosen to come home and no sound the night he had not. Nils asked for the things he always asked for: bank statements that showed a pattern of tiny drinks that add up, phone things that say more by saying nothing, the truths about fights that hadn’t been dignified with the word fight. He left feeling like a man who moves pieces around on a board where someone else has thrown three into the garden. It grounded him in the small because the big was performing above his head with drums.

By late afternoon he had a list that looked like a family tree in a town that refuses to admit to cousins. He took it to Vale because sometimes it is useful to see what a rich man’s face does when you offer him patterns. Vale’s face did something like satisfaction and then something like calculation and then it went very still in a way that told Nils that he had other lists he wasn’t showing. Vale said the name Grant with the affection of a man who had fired three men with that name and had been thanked later. He said there was another outfit in Crawley Down that liked to pretend they were Scouts for the environment and who had a habit of putting words like circular and economy on their flyers as if that absolved them from the boredom of actually doing it. He said, almost idly, that there was also a woman who had been using the dragon to raise money for something called a living history experience in the park and whether Nils would mind finding out whether that was the kind of history that put a turnstile near a lake and a gift shop under the trees or the kind that brought a teacher and let children touch newt water. Nils said he would mind a turnstile very much and that he would find out who one had to call to stop one appearing in a meeting agenda. Vale smiled and did that thing again with stillness and said that board members like turnstiles because they created lines and lines look like money from above and that if Nils had to push a councillor, he should do it gently because they fell over so theatrically.

By the time he stepped back into the street, the light had decided to be kind to people who were brave about their foreheads. He took his kindness to Paper Lantern because he had learned that there is nothing so efficient as sugar when you have to sit down with a day and ask it what it was for. Rowan was, as she often was when the town had been excessive, slightly quieter, like a radio turned two clicks down. She and Dina were arguing in the friendliest possible way about whether to put Plath near Plath or put her in the part of the shelf where yellow looked more confident. They asked Nils to adjudicate and he said something unhelpful but in a nice tone, and then Rowan told him, sotto voce, that the woman with the living history flyers had been in with printed pamphlets that showed lanterns and chalk rubbings and children in hats and that she had a donation bucket and a plan for selling dragon buns. Rowan’s voice made it clear that she was prepared to forgive a lot for a good bun but not the charter of the park being turned into a theme. Nils took a flyer and read the copy in which words like community and memory did a lot of heavy lifting. He took a picture of the QR code because he had decided to become the sort of man who would use QR codes in the name of justice. He told Rowan he had a dinner with Maggie and was not allowed a second slice of cake without permission, and Rowan said bring her a bun that isn’t from a supermarket and she would sponsor his misbehaviour.

He opted for walking to Maggie’s because his head had been inside vans and forms and he needed to let it be inside air and the smell of other people’s dinners for a bit. The semi-detached sat there being brave. Maggie opened the door with the kind of hug that suggested he’d been forgiven in advance for nothing in particular. She made a show of disapproving of his bandage and then kissed it, which had the interesting effect of making him embarrassed for a life he hadn’t lived yet. They ate, because that was the hold music before anything else happened in that house, and between bites Maggie ran themes past him: the woman on her street who had convinced two neighbours to plant the same flowers so the road felt like it had decided something without being told; whether the council would be moved by the image of grandmothers with clipboards enough to do what they ought; whether his father’s ghost had refiled the curry powders according to personal pleasure or some scheme. He told her only as much as he could about Vale, which was not much, because there was a superstition in him about not speaking rich men’s names in kitchens where herbs hang on the wall. She told him she had cleaned the spare room because she thought the town looked like it was going to hatch something again and that people who hatched things needed somewhere to put their feathers.

The night made a noise like cutlery being put away when he left Maggie’s, and he walked as if his bones liked to be consulted. In the narrow bit of road where the light has always been a half-second behind footsteps, two men decided to be lesson plans. They came off a doorway with the timing of a chorus and one moved behind him while the other tried to decide whether his smile was more effective than his chest. Nils did not speed up because running with the wrong shoes was a good way to fall into a story you didn’t want to tell later. He kept his hands visible because men who punch often need to feel invited and if you look already ready they go from drama to disappointment.

“Evening,” the chest said, and in the evening was the shape of a suggestion that things be handed over and that also a message was more important than a wallet. He carried the smell of a pub where the dishwasher had a leak and of cloves trying too hard to be a cover for the lack of other perfumes. The other one made his impatience audible through his breath.

Nils smiled because some mistakes come on leashes and you do not have to hold the leash. He said the kind of line men say when they have decided to look soft and be hard later, which was that he had nothing anyone would wish to keep and a great deal of things he wouldn’t advise carrying. He showed the empty palm and the foolish bandage and let them be, briefly, his witnesses. Clove’s friend took a step forward and then sideways, which was where Nils had wanted him all along. He let the step graze his space and then he turned his body in a way that left a forearm where the friend’s hand had expected to find air. He did not hit him; he just made the night decide that continuing was boring. The chest did the arithmetic men do in these moments, where the cost of continuing is weighed against the satisfaction of finishing, and then he chose to say words instead of escalate. He told Nils to keep away from things that have nothing to do with him in a voice that wanted to be a father and was instead a man going home with less hope. Nils nodded as if the advice were about vitamins and excused himself because he was a gentleman. He went back to his flat and told Officer Lewis, because being a nuisance with a paper trail suited him these days. She said he should come in tomorrow and show her where in the street his near-friends had enjoyed their night air and he said he would draw the patch in chalk if that suited her sense of humour; she said not to waste chalk and to get some sleep before he did the next brave stupid thing, which she pronounced like a hyphenated legal term.

Sleep was something that happened to other people for a while, but eventually it went to work on him and he dreamt of geologists at parties and clipboards that contained recipes and Vale standing at the edge of the pit ladling cold water out of a bucket labelled optics. He woke before the alarm again because his head insisted on making the same argument with the light. It was Tuesday and the council had decided to be officious on the internet; Tegan had sent him a photograph of a sign that said in big letters NO, and in small letters practitioners of common sense are thanked, and he had laughed while shaving which is his least safe habit.

He went to the yard behind the travel agents because Dina had texted an address that had been only half-apology. He found her in the corner where Rowan kept boxes for donations that turned into stock and old men’s habits; she had rearranged the poetry again, this time so that an older lady had to buy something she had not intended to because its colour flirted with the scarf she had on. Rowan called it commerce with ethics and paid Dina in cash and cake because sometimes you use cake as a bridge to currency when people can’t write down hours on a form out of shame. Dina had removed the makeup over the place where the infinity had been and replaced it with a bracelet her aunt had given her that had little charms shaped like tools. Nils told her Rebecca would turn her into a packet of paper that could be handed to people who wanted to be helpful in the correct way, and Dina told him she had slept and it had been three out of five and that she had decided she would not be on a letterhead again unless the letterhead also included a cat. It was more important than some of the arrest reports he had read to hear her say that with daylight.

There is a shape a day takes when you’ve agreed to be a richer man’s bloodhound. Nils felt it settle on his shoulders and decided he would not let it grow a tail. He did the boring thing first: he sat in his car and called Grant, who did not pick up because men named Grant only pick up the phone when you frame it as a loss. He left a message in the voice of a man who had found something of his in a skip and would he like to call back if he wanted the something to be returned and not given to someone else who would be less sentimental. He rang the number on the living history flyer and asked the woman whether she would like to meet and tell him about her vision, because he had learned that if you don’t ask before you accuse you are just a man who narrates from the corner of the room and calls it wisdom. She said with the brightness of a person who believed in the power of trestle tables that she would love to talk and that her name was Celia and that she had a team and that they were meeting in the pub by the park at one because you get more volunteers to volunteer if you promise crisps. He said he would be there and he would bring a small amount of good-bad news about candles and tape.

At the pub the air held three different kinds of disinfectant and the old weirdness of beer mats that had seen terrible decisions and were pretending to be innocent. Celia had hair that made decisions when she did and a smile that made you feel as if you’d just brought her a bolt of fabric. She liked to touch people’s arms when talking, and did it less when she saw Nils flinch because he liked to know where his limbs were and who rented them. She spoke with marvellous enthusiasm about an autumn festival that would bring in schools and grandads and lads from the football team if they could be persuaded to wear hi-vis and steward instead of running around like ecstatic puppies, and her plan for lanterns was a plan for lanterns made out of jars with battery lights inside them, and she laughed at herself because the bucket had been someone’s joke at the printer’s. Nils liked her more when she admitted that the dragon had got her half into this because she loved the way the town sounded when it said the word and half because when she had asked for donations for new bins for the duck pond nobody had answered and sometimes you have to put glitter on a sentence before people show up. He told her that glitter near chalk and heat made him itchy and she agreed without a show; he told her about Tegan’s grandmothers and she said she would make tea for them and not take the idea of volunteer lanyards personally. He left thinking that not everyone who said dragon deserved a lecture and that the town needed people whose first instinct was to put paper pumpkins on tables rather than fences around birds.

He’d promised to show Lewis the spot where men with cloves had practiced their hostility, so he did, using his hands as if describing a fish, which amused her and made her write neater. She recorded it on a map with a smile he liked and said that it was possible these boys were just generalists—men who enjoy being the reason other men don’t sleep—but that she would put patrols by the alley where the hairdresser’s shed its lights and that he should consider being accompanied at night by at least his common sense. He told her his common sense had a limp and she told him to lend it a stick. He gave her the registration number from Horley and she did not bless him or make promises; she just said, in the tone of a woman who disliked not being listened to, that sometimes the thing to hope for is not heroics but a good paper trail and a day when the magistrate had breakfast that agreed with them.

By late afternoon he had the feeling you get when everything’s arranged and fate has its hand on the cutlery drawer. He watched the park from the path with Tegan and her high-vis. The geologist had gone back to his people to write a report in paragraphs that would never be read by the people who had climbed under the fence. The tape flapped in the light like a flag trying out different countries. A group of children went by in a crocodile with a teacher who knew all their names and said each one like a bell, and one boy turned and waved at Nils with the solemnity of an ambassador. It softened everything; even Tegan smiled openly.

He did not expect the van during daylight because men who like night also like their habits, but it came anyway at six, while the volunteers were swapping clipboards and the shift was doing that lax thing between. It did not come with its lights off, because sunlight is a decent camouflage if you insist, and it did not come fast, because speed is drama and drama attracts men with notebooks. It came like a delivery in a town where deliveries are the soundscape. Nils watched it from the bend in the path where a beech had decided to lean and stopped himself from moving because his body always wanted to, and sometimes your body wants to be in the way of the story and sometimes your job is to let the story admit itself without you in it.

Officer Lewis saw it too because she had learned what his stillness meant and her hand did that subtle thing with her radio that meant please would everyone do their jobs without the performance part. The van stopped not by the pit but by the side gate that carries the modest sign for staff only, which always made Nils think about what authority looks like in lowercase. Two men got out. Neither was Colin; neither was Hungry. They had borrowed faces—the kind you wear when you do not want to be in a photograph—and one wore a baseball cap he had no loyalty to. Tegan stepped forward because she is the kind of person who steps forward when energy wants to loose its leash. She said, very pleasantly, that the park was closed to unauthorised vehicles and that if they wanted to try their luck with the main entrance she would bring them a sandwich to enjoy while they waited for disappointment. The driver smiled in that careful, kept way that has to do with teeth and not eyes and said he’d been told by someone at council to pick up some rubbish because of the dragon business. Lewis appeared then, perfect timing, uniform humming its song, and asked them for a name that could be checked with a phone call. When the phone call went nowhere, the men decided to be embarrassed instead of aggrieved, which was a relief, and reversed out with the dignity that is possible if you have not unloaded the guilt in the back.

Some days you do not earn your money because nothing enormous happens, and those are the days that keep men like Nils attached to less complicated towns. He went back to the shop to fetch Rowan to feed Maggie’s ghost and on the way saw Dina sitting with Mr. Tipsy, telling him in a very serious voice about a girl she had been who had chosen badly because the best part of bad choices was the story afterwards. Rowan caught his shoulder with two fingers as he passed and said that he looked like he was doing that thing where you tried to hold twenty thoughts and which two would he like to put down long enough to eat soup. He told her he would put down anger and something else too messy to name, and she kissed the edge of his jaw in a gesture that lived exactly between familial and a dare and then she went to get her coat.

The soup corrected a number of the day’s sins by the simple method of being hot and being there. Maggie insisted on hearing about Celia and her jars, and Rowan suggested in her softest voice that Maggie could do a stall where you bring something ugly and leave with something pretty because Maggie could make an hour look elegant, and Maggie tried not to adore the idea and failed. They said the sort of small things that make a home out of the space between plates: that the bin men had adopted the old cat on the corner and that bagels should be toasted on one side only and that sometimes you have to let the flowers choose their own vase. Nils sat deeper in his chair than he usually let himself; Rowan’s ankle found his and rested there as if the day had made decisions on their behalf.

He walked them home slow because everything in him had acquired appetite. The town at that hour looked like somewhere kinder than it is, which is all anyone can ask. At his own doorway a folded piece of paper stuck itself to his mind by the same trick fate uses whenever it wants to make small things feel like big ones. Someone had tucked a note under the mat in the way cowards pretend to be considerate. He picked it up and knew it would be the kind of note that wasn’t a note but a pretext. The handwriting was the tidy variety men try to acquire in prison and sometimes do: col thinks you brought the police. keep away from the yard. keep away from the girl. We know where you drink and how you walk. It was not signed in any way that would last, but there was a smear of spice on the corner where a thumb had not quite been clean enough, and Nils allowed himself the small vanity of thinking it looked like cloves.

He went up the stairs laughing under his breath because you had to put the fear somewhere and laughter is the place that does least harm. He took a photograph of the note and sent it to Lewis and Rebecca with the smallest caption in his vocabulary. Lewis replied first, not over text, but with a call that made the phone feel like a hand. She said, in a voice that promised bureaucracy on a platter, that she would add it to her growing pile of reasons to visit Colin’s associates before breakfast, and then she asked whether Nils wanted to join the volunteer line again tomorrow because they were trying to look robust and nothing says robust like men in ordinary coats pretending to be important. He said he would bring his new sincere yellow garment, and she said not to get too fond of it because she’d make him hand it back if he started to get above himself. He liked her too much and he knew it.

He slept, not quickly, but thoroughly, because he had made a list and lists are a kind of sedative. In the morning he would call Vale and say that day one had produced plates and names and a sense of timing; he would go to Horley and see whether the tidy padlock had acquired an extra scrape; he would be polite to Celia again because she would be sad when she realised she needed to rename her lantern walk something less flammable; he would throw his stubborn into the passive fray of council emails; he would ask Tegan to write a sentence that looked like a petition and then he would decide whether he had the nerve to ask the councillor to be good in a way that would not result in an apology video later. He put the note from the mat under a mug like it was a trapped insect and wrote another line under his own old admonition on the file: stop promising miracles. Try honesty. Try caution. Try patience too, you idiot. He blew out the candle he used to trick himself into believing the room had a hearth and slept until the light came in and put its hands on his face like a mother deciding to forgive him.

Morning brought weather with an opinion. Rain tried its luck and then reversed, as if it had seen who was out and decided not to embarrass them. The park had a different smell, like enthusiastic laundry, and when Nils arrived with his sincere jacket Tegan handed him a clipboard and a pen that had already given up twice that morning and said he looked like he could be firm without being unkind and would he like to say the words please don’t to teenagers in a way that made them laugh and obey. He did exactly that for an hour and thought, not for the first time, that this was the bit of being a person he had been built for and that all the other bits were just variations on being a citizen with a pen.

On the far side, near the pit, a new sign had been fixed with enough cable ties to secure a bridge. It said that heat was being monitored and that the Environment Agency loved a sensor, and it had a QR code that would tell you what lithium did when you dumped it in the wrong place, and the code fetched a page that included three sketches that looked like something Rowan would have admired: a battery’s inside and an arrow that could have been a dragon’s breath if you were whimsical. People stopped, let their foreheads wrinkle just enough to count as thinking, and then moved on. He caught sight of Celia shepherding a pair of spare lanterns back to her car in the rain that wasn’t, and he raised a hand and she raised hers and they were both relieved that the day had chosen to be un-dramatic.

Hungry appeared in daylight like a badly edited thought. He had a hoodie Nils had seen on every boy in Crawley at some point, and a way of standing that telegraphed boredom like it was a weapon. He looked at Nils, not with recognition exactly, but with that teenage male calculus that assesses what it would be like to push you and whether there would be friends to watch if he did. Nils did not offer him anything to misinterpret; he just said to him what he said to anyone there: be careful near the fence if you like your hands, and Hungry did not smile and did not insult and shrugged his shoulders as if he were dusting them off with his own doubt, then melted into a group of lads who were pretending to stretch their hamstrings and were actually flexing their anonymity.

Lewis walked the line, not officious, but visible. She stopped with him and told him in a low voice about two lock-ups that had been visited at dawn by people with warrants and interesting shoes, and the inside of one had gleaned nothing much but dust and second-hand parts, and the other had produced empty crates that smelled like batteries and the kind of paperwork that needed a household name to translate. She said a name that made Nils’s shoulder blades step closer together: Vale’s second cousin once removed’s company, which had a finger in everything from signage to scooters to the kiosks you wished would sell you ice cream and sold you disappointment. It could be coincidence; it could just be that rich men had too many fingers and towns had too few pies. She did not tell him to be careful because she had learned that doing so just made him arch, but she stood next to him for a full minute and they said nothing, which sometimes was the way to say everything worth saying.

By mid-morning he took a break the way volunteers do: leaning on a damp post and eating a biscuit that had come out of a tin that had dreams of being a family heirloom. He checked his phone between proper bites and saw that Vale had sent a two-word text that made him want to be petty: Progress? He wrote back a sentence longer than necessary about plates and units and Horley and Copthorne and a van that had lost its audacity at a gate, and Vale sent a thumbs-up that had the air of a signature applied to someone else’s achievement. He pushed the small mood that rose out of that away with a laugh at himself because if he caught feelings every time a rich man signalled approval like a parent at a school play, he would need to be paid in therapy.

Celia popped back up with a tray of homemade things, which earned her love from the grandmothers and an indulgent, suspicious smile from Tegan. Celia said she had found a different use for jars and pulled out little terrariums with moss and the tiniest plastic dinosaurs buried in the green, and the children who saw them made noises that were better for the world than any petition. Nils bought one for Maggie and one for Rowan and told himself he was not a man who kept toys and had to confront the obvious. He texted a picture of the dinosaur to Rowan and she replied with one of Mr. Tipsy looking like he had an opinion about extinction. It steadied him more than a hot dinner would have.

At noon he told Tegan he would be back for the later shift if she needed a man whose main skills included smiling at strangers without being creepy, and then he walked to his car and went to Horley again because some days require a second look to make the first one feel like due diligence. The padlock had changed. It was newer, shinier, and the screws on the number two units had the same clean smudge that said new screwdriver, old problem. He sat with his engine off and watched the door like it might perform in the next ten minutes. It did not. Men came and went at the ends of the row: a woman with paint under her nails and a man with a stack of chairs and another man with a face that had solved his problems with a different kind of lock a long time ago. Nils did the thing he sometimes does when a door is trying to be a character; he yawned, ostentatiously, and pretended to sleep with his eyes half-shut. Men will leave doors alone if they think you can see them; they will open them if they think you are too bored to care.

After four false alarms, the unit burped up a boy with a trolley full of nothing like evidence. He had the slightly feral look of a teenager who has been entrusted with errands beyond his capacity and was intent on not failing. The trolley contained bundles of wire, the sort you get when you strip the skin off old technology to sell its copper bones, and the boy’s hands had that grey-green you can’t wash off fully. Nils watched him load the wire into the back of a different van, not the white one from yesterday, and clocked the plate and the charm bracelet hanging from the rearview that had the shape of a sideways eight. He sighed, and his sigh had the shape of a circle.

It would have been nice to end the day with nothing but small good things that stack like coasters. It had decided to give him something else. In the late afternoon, when the park was doing that thing where it pretends not to be a crime scene, an older man in a fine coat whose collar had its own morals turned up with a small troupe of people whose shoes were wrong for the path. He introduced himself as the councillor who loved the park more than his own face and who could quote budget lines by their nicknames, and he had a pair of assistants who looked at Tegan like she was an obstacle and a child, which was a fascinating combination. He told Tegan that his office was forming a task force and that the task force would be very tasky and that together they would Come To A Resolution. Tegan, who has lost all patience for capital letters when they do not come with time and money, said they already had a force and it was made of volunteers and the Council was welcome to task itself with supporting them properly. The councillor tried charm and found it came out sticky; he tried stern and found it bounced off the tape. He asked whether they had thought about what would happen to the park’s reputation if the word dragon got glued to it like chewing gum under a church pew. Nils coughed and said that sometimes reputations pay for themselves and that if the Council wanted the story to say hazard handled well by capable people, the story could be made to do that with tea and maps. Tegan gave him a glance that was both gratitude and a joke, and the assistant nearest him wrote something in a notebook as if it were a list of enemies and friends.

That was the hour when Dina arrived to take a clipboard. She had tied her hair up in a knot that insulted gravity, and she wore her hoodie like armour and like an apology. She stood next to Nils and said in a voice only orchestrated for his benefit that she had been offered three different jobs since morning by men who wanted her to lift things and one by a woman who wanted her to list things, and she had said yes to the woman because listing felt like being a person and lifting felt like being a tool. He told her she was poetry, and she did the thing where she accepted the compliment without making it a debt. Her aunt came by with a Tupperware that might have contained an ocean and hugged her hello with the ferocity of someone who had been waiting too long for a chance to perform their worrying.

Nils stayed until his feet objected. He had promised Rowan he wouldn’t be stupid twice in a day, so he did the clever thing and went home while it was still evening and light had opinions about how people were supposed to behave. He walked up his stairs counting the steps twice by habit, and when he got to his door he stopped because his brain, which had been practising, noticed the small wrongness. The lock had nothing to show him but obedience, but the mat had migrated a fraction and the air inside the door had the smell of a person who doesn’t live there. He opened very quietly and stood in the threshold like that has a legal power and it doesn’t, and he listened.

There are few sounds more specific than a person breathing in a room who believes themselves alone. He knew the breath wasn’t Dina’s or Maggie’s or Rowan’s; it had the shape of a man who uses too much chest and not enough ribs. He slipped the folding knife out because hypocrisy is charming in men who are polite for a living, and he said a sentence that was true and ridiculous, which was that he had called the police ten minutes ago and they were on their way and if the person in his sitting room would like to leave with all his teeth he could do so now, quietly, without stopping to apologise or rage. There was a silence that had in it the shape of calculation, and then a man stepped out of the dark in the way men step out when they are both brave and tired. It wasn’t Colin; it wasn’t Hungry. It was a third, a man with a face like someone had sat on it and too much hair product, and he looked around as if expecting to like the place and then deciding to stick with resentment.

He said that the problem with men like Nils was that they liked to write things down; he said he had been told to tell Nils that writing things down makes them exist when they don’t need to, and he said it with a sort of sorrow Nils could almost respect. Nils said that the problem with men who break into other men’s homes was that their sentences were all lessons and no nouns. The man smiled in a way that would have worked on someone else and then he did something stupid with his hands that meant he had to take two steps forward, and Nils put his shoulder into him like he was moving furniture and showed him the door in a way that would be illegal if you filmed it badly. The man swore at him in a dialect that was mostly spite and then left with the theatre of someone who has been almost hit. Nils shut the door and leaned his forehead against it and laughed until his body remembered what adrenaline does to stomachs. Then he texted Lewis exactly what had happened with exactly where the exact man had probably gone, which was into the pub with the pool table because men like that like to rehearse their failures with cues. She sent back three words that, in her mouth, meant grail: on our way.

He cleaned his own kitchen as if he were making a point, which some days is all any of us can do. Then he went to Paper Lantern because pretending his flat was a fortress would be a comedy too far and because the shop smelled like a thing he could not lose. Rowan had closed early because the town had been exhausting, and she frowned at the idea of his door and then, because she had business to give, she got him to move boxes that had no actual purpose except to make him stand in the back room where the light is bad and talk. He told her about the intruder, and she put her hands on his face like you do for people whose skin you know in all weather and told him not to give men like that the privilege of a nickname because nicknames are intimacy. She said he could stay on her sofa like a teenager and he said he would snore and she said that was fine because Mr. Tipsy did it better. They pretended not to notice what this was, which was a rehearsal for something they would not do again, and he slept wrapped in the difficult scent of second-hand paper and cat and her, and dreamed of warnings written on lampposts and of Tegan making a city council sit on tiny chairs.

He woke to a cat on his sternum and to the sound of bins doing their usual audition for apocalypse. He made coffee because he could pretend this was his house and then was immediately ashamed and put the kettle back down and waited for Rowan to pretend not to notice. She brought him a mug with a chip he loved and said something in an unshowy way about how there should be more places in the world where men can be fools and here is one, and he wanted to sit on the floor and weep like a child at the way she had made his body safe. He drank instead and wrote out, in the neat pencil he kept for decent habits, the list he would give Vale at ten: plates, names, lock-ups, the Councillor who had needed his sleeves rolled for him, Celia and jars and the difference between spectacle and care, Tegan and her grandmothers, Lewis and the bit about on our way that had made him feel, for a minute, like a citizen of a country that worked, Dina working shelves like she was threading a needle, Ralph’s drawer, the Horley boy with grey-green hands, and the intruder who had no nickname and a problem with doorways.

By the time he stood outside Vale’s office again, the day had decided to behave like a colleague, not a rival. Vale listened, not well, but well enough to have paid for lessons. He did not ask about the man in Nils’s flat; he asked about the councillor’s assistants and whether their shoes were municipal or private, which said more about his brain than anything else. He said, almost absentmindedly, that he’d had a call from an old friend in the Environment Agency who wanted to know whether he would help them with messaging if the press decided to fixate, and he was considering with all the disdain he could manage whether to let his name be near the word dragon. Nils said nothing, because some sentences get better when you starve them of oxygen. Vale asked whether the yard had been lively and whether the Horley lock-up had acquired a new lock. Nils said yes to the second and that first question would cost extra if he wanted the colour. Vale asked, idly—well done idly, the way you imagine a pianist practises scales—how close Nils was to the girl with the hoodie, and Nils said the distance would be kept proper and Vale had the decency to look embarrassed by his own curiosity.

The week that follows this sort of beginning can be written in high notes or in lists, and Nils chose both and neither as he went, because a town gives you its small eats in exchange for your attention and the trick is not to choke. He would spend mornings with clipboards and geese and Tegan’s large voice; afternoons taking pictures of number plates and the colour of padlocks and the look of men’s shoes; evenings drinking tea in a kitchen where the spices had made their peace with the ghost. The boy named Hungry would look at him three times like a person measuring a cliff he wanted to jump and then walk away because sometimes the best part of the night is not making a new enemy. Dina would tell him, in a very flat voice, that she had been offered a chance to tell a different story to a journalist who was very invested in eggs the size of babies and she had declined because stories were expensive and she was saving up for one she could keep. The councillor would announce a task force and the task force would be six people with clipboards and a hashtag and Tegan would keep them because she had learned to feed her enemies before they pretended to be friends.

In the dark, one night, a teenager would put a sparkler into the warm patch and the sparkler would give up like a clown who had discovered the birthday party was for a cat; this fact would spread and be turned into a parable by the grandmother with the strongest opinions and then it would be fine. In daylight, a man in a very clean coat would park near the tape, stride up to it, and take a selfie with the vapour behind him in the frame, and Tegan would appear in his picture with a thumbs-up that would get more likes than his face. At the lock-up, a man with a bicep tattoo of an animal that could not be identified by any naturalist would mention to Nils in a voice that was bored in a way that wanted to be scary that if a person was seen around too much they would start to be considered scenery—a useful thing to move or step on. Nils would call Lewis and tell her that he had been promoted to furniture and she would snort in a way that did him good and tell him not to become an ottoman, because feet go on those and she refused to believe he was built for that.

And on the seventh day, or at least a day that felt Biblical because it rained properly for the first time, the pit would do something ordinary and alarming at once: it would cool. The geologist and his jumper would tilt his head and say that smoulder goes out when it runs out of things to smoulder and that the chalk was a liar in so many ways but not about this, and that they would monitor and then write a report nobody would read until it suited them to. The dragon would be demoted to a postcard in a café that made good toasties, and Celia would announce in the group that the autumn festival would be called Night by the Lake with Stories, and Tegan would give her half the volunteers because she had been good and had fed them cake. Vale, who had not been designed to accept the humble version of an ending, would insist on a meeting at which he would say that money had been spent and that people had been warned and that he had pulled a string which had moved a man in a jumper into position faster than usual; Nils would let him have his victory and present a normal-looking report with names and registrations and lock-up numbers that would allow Vale to feel like a god of lists and protect without being thanked.

There would be a quiet bit, which would be the only part Nils would remember once the adrenaline was exiled. He would be in Paper Lantern as Rowan closed, and Dina would be folding a bag in that way people do when they are trying not to think about how near and how far they have come. Rowan would look at him with the eyes that always made him mispronounce his own life, and she would say, in a voice like a pen, that he had done it well and he had not made himself a hero to make himself feel better, and that she saw the shape he had been and the shape he was being now, and he would almost say the thing he banned himself from saying, and instead he would pick up Mr. Tipsy and get scratched and call it tax.

Then the week would end on a small, perfect mistake. Nils, who never learned, would be at the window of his flat at a ridiculous hour watching a boy far below learning to wheelie, and a plane would underline the town again, and a message would arrive from a number he had not saved because he had decided he would not force fate: thank you, it would say, a different font this time and the punctuation wrong because the phone was old, and this one he would know was Dina and he would allow himself an indulgent tear for a person who had decided to live here and not in a story other people had picked for her. He would write: you did the big part. Then he would go to bed and not dream of dragons and wake with the smell of someone else’s toast and decide, this once, to be cheerful on purpose.
