On certain mornings the city smelled like boiled pennies and seaweed and a rumor of smoke. Tacoma’s breath. Nate Hollis drove with the window cracked enough to let it in, because he said the smell kept him alert, and because he felt that if you were going to work in a place you should know how it tasted. His beat-up van rattled over a pothole on 6th Avenue and the bent wrench he kept wedged above the glove box slapped the dash with a familiar clank. The magnet had fallen off months ago; he kept meaning to jury-rig it with epoxy and a tie, and kept forgetting.

He parked outside a narrow blue house that had once been a fisherman’s cottage, back when Thea Foss Waterway was a slop of boat oil and legends. A woman named Lacy Mae had called about low water pressure and a smell in the kitchen sink that wouldn’t be coaxed away by citrus peels and baking soda. “Like the ghost of a wet dog,” she’d said.

It was early, the sky a gray-white fleece with the shape of the Narrows Bridge faint and bone-like in the distance. The lawn seethed with tiny damp ferns. Nate tried to take in the whole picture—a habit from his father—roofline to foundation, gutters to crawlspace access, because plumbing problems were often architecture in disguise. Nothing unusual, except the crawlspace door’s lower right corner had been chewed by something with a taste for damp wood.

They talked, he and Lacy. He put on shoe covers and she apologized for the mess and moved a drying rack’s worth of baby clothes. There was a faint smell of sour drains and coffee. He ran the faucet, felt the shudder in the pipe. Old copper. He could hear the complaint in the walls, like an old man asked to dance. “It’s probably a restriction. I’ll go under, check the main after the shut-off.”

He didn’t mind the dirty places. The tightness and the chill. It was a good part of what made the job feel like a job. He had been going down into crawlspaces since his father threw him a flashlight at fourteen and said, in that drill-sergeant jokey way, “Go seek the minotaur, Nater. Bring back the ball of thread.” He thought of the breath of mud, the pockets of strange air, the lost marbles and screwdrivers and the occasional dead squirrel. The sticker burrs, the cold sting in the fingers. The knowledge that at eye level, the world is built out of improvisations. He liked that.

The flashlight beam skimmed the ground as he belly-crawled under the house. The air was damp, colder still. A plastic Tyvek sheet rustled like snake skin beneath him, and he kept one elbow on the two-by-eight that someone had kindly placed as a spine along the space. He could hear the house moan above as Lacy walked across the kitchen, the small thunder of toddler feet following behind. He shined the light along the main run, found the shut-off, the compression fitting that always made a nasty little grin at you, and what looked like a sloppily soldered elbow that probably belonged to a handyman named Pete who swore he knew what flux was.

He kept moving. The smell shifted. Something sweet-and-sour, stronger than the kitchen. He moved the light and found, at the sill near a vent, a nest. Paper wasp. Tan, layered, a lantern that had outlived summer. He told himself it was old. He whispered, “You’re old,” as if it would obey. He steadied his breath and slithered forward.

The nest was not dead. The first wasp lifted like a comma uncoiling. The beam of his flashlight cut across it and it seemed to swim in light. Then the next came, and another, and the rustle amplified from tiny to a sort of static, like the noise you get when a radio station is close but not quite yours.

Nate’s face went cold. The hard hat he didn’t wear, the goggles he didn’t put on—he felt every absence. One wasp landed on the back of his glove. He didn’t move. He know you were supposed to know things, like what species and what behavior. Paper wasps were, what, territorial? Taunted easily? The Tyvek sheet crackled under his chest.

“Easy,” he said aloud. To himself, to them. He took one slow breath in and one slow breath out. Another landed on the beam next to his ear and turned its little head and something clicked inside him and all at once everything in the space hummed with insect life. Not just the wasps. Something scuttled, a fast Morse code in the plastic margin. Slim bodies that responded to warmth, to the salt of him.

He had never liked bugs. He was not squeamish, he would have argued that fiercely, but uneasy at the anonymous skitter, at the certainty that they were in the millions always. He had been fine—just fine—down here before. Bugs were part of it. They were part of the planet. He knew these things He knew them. And yet.

Another wasp fluttered close to his mouth, drawn by the damp heat of words. Ten tiny legs in the beam, floating. He jerked, involuntary; the sheet hissed under him. The wasps made their particular, unmistakable sound: not like bees, not the workman buzz but a papery tremolo. His chest knotted. He kicked backwards without thinking. His shoulder found a joist. The flashlight spun out of his hand and bounced into the unmapped dark and in the second of total darkness he saw, or believed he saw, the space fill with segmented grace, with antennaed intent, a river of chitin.

“Hey—are you okay?” Lacy’s voice filtered through the floorboards, thinned by wood and dusty insulation.

“Fine,” he lied, and found the beam. His breath was too loud. His heart sounded like a hammer awkwardly striking copper. He couldn’t go forward. He also couldn’t turn around without brushing past the nest. He pictured the before of this morning, the ordinariness. Get in, get out, send the invoice. He pictured his father’s narrow eyes narrowing further at the idea of calling through the floor to a client to please get him, a grown man, a can of wasp killer.

He focused on the beam, on his elbows, his good right knee. He moved one increment at a time, and somehow made it back to the hatch. When he saw the rectangle of light he wanted to cry from relief, which made him furious—furious at himself for wanting to cry, which made the tears tremble more. He put a forearm on the frame and pulled himself up and the air under the house broke from him with a sigh like a held note stopping.

He stood in the kitchen with dust on his face and felt too tall. Lacy looked anxious. “Was it a rat? I saw a rat in the alley last week and I haven’t been right since.”

“Wasps and, uh, a little bit of, you know.” He gestured. “I’ll need, um, to come back with—” He couldn’t think of the name for the suit, suddenly, the net, the whole kit. Bug gear? He thought of words he used all day—escutcheon, tailpiece, dielectric union—and how the simple word wouldn’t come. He cleared his throat. “I’ll send out a guy who’s not me to deal with any, uh, friends down there first, if that’s okay. I can’t risk getting stung. I’ve got… I had a reaction once. I should’ve asked. I’ve got Benadryl in the truck, but I’m not supposed to—” He heard himself piling lies like boards.

“Oh my god,” she said. “Are you allergic?”

“I might be. I’m not a hundred percent sure. But it’s safer, you know, like in a crawl. In a confined.”

She stepped back three steps with her child on her hip, and the child reached toward him with fingers sticky from something unseen and said, “Bee,” with huge gravity. Nate felt a laugh come up, thin and hysterical, and swallowed it.

He left quickly. The van smelled like sweating vinyl already even though the day was cool. He sat with his hands on the wheel and tried to slow the tremor. Outside, the fog was burning back and a blade of sun cut across the street and made a puddle into a coin. He watched a woman jog past with a dog that looked like a gray loaf. A wasp, maybe the same, maybe its cousin, tapped the window glass with a bored persistence and he flinched as if it might magic itself through. He shook his head hard, as if to rattle something loose.

He thought he would laugh about it later. He drove to a different house, a no-heat call up near Proctor. He sat in that driveway too long, imagining spiders coiled in the basement like thoughts. He finally went in and found a circulator pump that had seized so tight it sang when he touched it, and that was ordinary, and he felt steadied by ordinary.

There was a cheap diner on North 26th where the coffee tasted burnt and the eggs had edges like lace, the cook a woman with a beehive in defiance of the present decade. He ate and played the little game where he guessed people’s lives from their boots. The long walk back to humanity.

He would have said out loud, later, or to himself later, that it would pass. The body forgets.

But the next crawlspace had a silverfish that came out of nowhere like a punctuation mark from under a damp ledger board and skittered toward his wall of tools, and he backed out. The one after that had no visible bugs but the idea of them had grown. He found he could not reach his arm into the darkness of a pipe to retrieve a nut without thinking of antennae a hair’s-width from his fingertips, millions of eyes that were not eyes measuring his heat. He was moving strange around basements, performing arcs to avoid the corners where cobwebs gathered like thoughts you didn’t want to have. The other guys noticed.

“Hey, Bug Hollis,” Troy said, with that special union of teasing and cruelty that men in trucks perfect.

“I’m just thinking about safety. OSHA and all that,” Nate said, and Troy laughed until he coughed. Troy had a smoker’s cough that sounded like an old engine turning over. He was not a bad man, but he liked to find the soft spots in others and press them. It was his way of finding out someone’s edges.

Marta, who ran scheduling from a desk where pens went to die, tried to hide her frustration as the reschedules stacked up. “I can put you on water heater swaps. Those are mostly in garages. Spiders don’t have garages. Wait, they do,” she corrected herself, smiling with only one side of her mouth. “But fewer, maybe. I don’t know. Nate. Is this a thing? You’re…? Because our thing is crawlspaces. Our special is crawls.”

“It’s a temporary thing,” he said. “I’m working it out.”

“Great,” she said. “Work it faster.”

He went home to an apartment behind a grocery store on South Tacoma Way, the kind of place where the sound of carts rattling outside at eleven p.m. blended with sirens and the distant random bass thump that was someone else’s joy. The window looked out on a skinny tree planted in a square of dirt the city had cut in the sidewalk. He liked the tree. It was a volunteer, probably, not the exact right species according to whatever green map, but stubborn. He heated a can of chili. He scrolled through old photos on his phone of his father’s hands holding a length of pipe, the grain of their skin like topographical maps. He texted his step-sister, Iris, something like, You still breathing? because that was how they talked. She replied with a video of a street violinist in Seattle, the bow whirring like saw teeth through a Vivaldi that wasn’t. It sounded like rain.

“Come visit,” she added. “I have a futon that tells the truth about itself and doesn’t pretend to be a couch.”

“I have jobs,” he wrote back, then deleted it, then wrote, “Someday,” then deleted it, then wrote only a thumbs-up because he felt simple on a screen.

When he tried to sleep he could feel the twitch in his legs that meant alertness. He imagined a wasp finding the gap under the window and setting up a tiny empire in the hollow of his curtain rod. He closed his eyes and saw the whorl of the nest in close detail, the architecture of tiny slopes. He woke once with his hand slapping his own cheek because a dream ant had walked there (there was no actual ant).

What a ridiculous man, he thought, and the thought was not kind. But there it was. He had a job a ten-year-old might describe in earnest and he was squeamish now like a child. He imagined his father’s eyebrows, the way one of them had a scar splitting it from the time he’d been knocked off a ladder by a refrigerator that wanted to keep its spot. “Nater,” his father would say, voice rough from years in basements and in bars. “Bugs eat fear. It’s what they drink. You give them a gallon, they’ll throw a party.” Then he would have laughed. He’d have also, before he laughed, ordered him back under.

But his father was dead two years in the ground, a heart that simply ran out, a simplicity Nate both resented and envied. He sat on the edge of the bed and put his feet flat on the carpet and tried to breathe like a man on some podcast had said to breathe: in for a slow four, hold for seven, out for eight, which made him dizzy. He tried to name things in the room. Lamp. Socks on chair. Pocketknife. The business card from Iris’s last show, the one with a black bird like a notation. He tried to imagine the tunnel under the house as a stage, and the wasps as a brass section warming up behind the curtain. It did not help but came back to him later, on another day, as a better metaphor, which surprised him.

The next morning he told Marta he thought he had the flu. She said, “Which kind? The convenient kind?” and then sighed. “You have PTO. Use it or don’t. I can’t force you.”

He walked. He didn’t know anywhere better to put himself. He went down to Ruston Way and let the wind kick at him. The water was a field of hammered metal and the gulls were malicious philosophers. He watched one hover and stare with one eye like it was reading his secrets. A couple took engagement photos leaning against a white railing and the photographer said, “Laugh, laughs!” and the woman tried out her different versions, one after another like a switchboard lighting up and going dark and lighting up.

By the fishing pier, an older man with a green hat was teaching a boy to cast. Patient patience. “Stop trying so hard,” the man said. “You look like you’re going to fight the water.” Nate wanted to write down that line and realized with a small consternation that he had no pen. He was not a writer; he was a man who kept wishing to be a different man and then found himself with no tools for that.

He ducked into a secondhand shop near Wright Park because it smelled like eucalyptus and old records and he felt safer there somehow. He bought a flannel he didn’t need because it was the color of cranberry juice and looked honest. He touched a set of antique prints of beetles—bright, precise, careful—and his stomach lurched. A child bumped him and said, “Sorry” like a little adult, and he said, “No worries, I’m the one in the way,” and meant it.

He lasted two more days pretending to be sick and then one day of actually being sick with the misery of it, the mind gnawing itself while the body sat idle, and then he went back because the rent did not pretend to be anything except rent. He tried to take jobs that were above ground. Water heaters, outside hose bibs, a picky homeowner in Stadium District who wanted every visible pipe under her pedestal sink arranged like sculpture. “I want this to look like a Paris hotel,” she said, and he thought, Tacoma is not Paris, but he didn’t say it, he took his time with the angles and wiped his fingerprint off the chrome.

The fear did not proceed in a line but in the unpredictable geometry panic loves. Some days he did fine. Some he found himself avoiding the box of brass fittings because a rogue earwig had once crawled through it like a politician working a room. He lost track of time watching a housefly on the shop window, how it battered itself against the glass, resting. Trying again. Resting. It felt like a metaphor from a bad novel. He knew better than to explain it to anyone, but of course he did anyway, to Char, the bartender at The Mule.

“Maybe you need—what do you call it. Exposure therapy,” she said, wiping a nonexistent spill with a cloth whose cleanliness he couldn’t tell by eye. “My sister did that for public speaking. They made her do stand-up one night. It was either exposure therapy or hazing.”

“I’m not afraid of microphones,” he said.

“Maybe you’re afraid of life,” she said with affection, pouring him a beer he did not strictly need. “Everyone knows that one. Cheers.”

Troy slid onto the stool two over and said, “Heard you bailed out under Lacy Mae’s place. Heard she was very disappointed in your bravery, Hollis.”

“Men who laugh at fear are usually trying to drown their own,” Char said, not looking at either of them, voice offhand, a pulled thread that stops the ripping.

Troy laughed as if she’d told a joke. He meant no harm, they would all say later, if asked to swear it. That was part of the harm.

When Nate finally put words to it, to himself, it was in the mirror over a sink he had installed, an oval with beveled edges that made his face look divided. “I’m scared of bugs,” he said to the glass. The words sounded foolish and childlike, and also like a fact that would not budge because of being laughed at. Saying it did not make it ease. But the truth had weight and sat differently in his chest than denial. He wanted to do something with it. He didn’t know what.

He went to a counselor once, a woman near the UPS campus with kind eyes and terrible artwork hung with good intention. He sat on a couch that was better at pretending to be a couch than Iris’s futon. He told the story. He felt old doing it and young doing it and utterly, unhandsomely himself.

“We can work with phobias,” she said. “There are tools. Breathing, yes. Imagery, sometimes. Gradual exposure. It’s important to build a ladder you can climb one rung at a time.”

“I can’t stop making ladders,” he said. “It’s not the building of them that stops me. It’s that I’m down there, and the rung is covered in tiny legs. The rung is alive. And my brain goes sideways and won’t come back for hours. When I see a moth—just a moth—outside my window at night, it’s like the window is trying to think.”

“Your brain is trying to protect you,” she said gently. “It’s overshooting.”

“It’s embarrassing,” he said.

“It is also human,” she said.

He did not go back to her because the idea of building a ladder to a place full of bugs in the presence of a calm woman with a box of tissues seemed almost comic, but he did not forget the tone she used, a tone he recognized from when his mother had explained thunderstorms to him at eight. You’re safe in the house. The lightning has far to go to find you. We can count seconds and know where it is. He put that tone in his pocket as a tool.

People did not offer support, not in the way he imagined a neat pamphlet on phobias might describe. What they offered was jokes, or impatience, or a story about a neighbor’s cousin who’d been stung and almost died, which was meant to mean something like Take it seriously, but came across like You are being dramatic about the wrong thing. It was as if the city conspired to give him exactly the wrong what. Even the news blared a summertime segment on murder hornets, the B-roll looping through the TV at the auto shop like a warning from a cartoon universe.

There was one person who did not tease him. She did not even attempt comfort in the usual way. Iris sent him music. Not songs with words that sat on him like advice, but pieces of sound she was working on, little experiments that came as voice notes full of breath and street noise jumbled in. “Here’s the way the bus sounds on 3rd,” she wrote once. “Like, if you listen, the wheels on the bus are in C but the brakes are definitely in E-flat and I can’t make them agree and the driver is turning the wheel which squeaks somewhere near G.” He listened and could hear it, and the hearing it made the city sound less like a threat and more like orchestra tuning up before the real work.

They were not close in the way of sharing their insides all at once, Iris and Nate. She was his father’s wife’s daughter; she had arrived when he was fifteen and already tired of his own friends. She was eight and made rhythms with her fork and chewed too loudly. He had not wanted to love her. It was impossible not to, after a while. She would sit on the dryer and watch him fix a broken coupler and hum in time with the wrench. She wrote a song, in the loose way of children, about the smell of Teflon tape. He used to joke she should compose the sound of water being tamed. She rolled her eyes. She grew into angles and opinions and then lightened again toward him when their father died, as if the loss pulled them toward the exact middle of each other in spite of their very busy lives.

“Come see the piece,” she texted in September. “It’s in a tiny gallery on Capitol Hill, so tiny it should be a punctuation mark. I’m making the walls vibrate. You’ll hate it maybe. I can handle it.”

“I’ve got a job,” he started typing. He pictured the crawlspace again, the paper nest. He pictured the woman at the engagement photos trying on laughs. He pictured the gull staring. He owed nobody in Tacoma, except the rent. It wasn’t even a good month for making excuses. He deleted the job and wrote, “What night?” and then deleted that and wrote, “Tell me when and I’ll drive up. Maggie can cover if it’s Friday,” which was three lies and a promise. He sent it. For a few seconds he felt the ache in his chest loosen by a millimeter.

On a morning like any other the rain came down in thin slants, not hard enough to justify complaining, and he drove to a house off 38th that had no crawlspace at all, praise be. On his way, the radio played a cello concerto that felt like someone talking sense to him—a slow, melancholic sensibility that nevertheless did not sulk. He parked, turned the engine off, and sat in the new quiet, holding the feeling like an egg.

“Do you hear that?” he said aloud. He didn’t know who he was asking. The cello did not answer. A fly rubbed its hands together in the thin light and he stared it down and it stared back and he said, “Not today,” as if to a dog. He went inside and worked fast and careful and came back out with a line that did not drip. It felt like a victory whose size he refused to judge.

At the job after that the homeowner wanted to talk about bees while he installed a faucet. “We have a hive up in the third maple,” she said with a shot of pride. “We got a guy to come and move them to a better spot. We saved them. I felt like I didn’t know how to be proud of anything until then.”

“That’s great,” he said, then swallowed and felt ridiculous, fighting the prickling at the back of his arms. He wanted to say, “Bees are good” in a robust way. He wanted to rewrite the part of his brain that looked at a housefly like a prophecy of ruin. He had not found the switch yet.

He drove to Seattle on a Wednesday because he said he would. The traffic cinched and slackened like a muscle. The clouds were a ceiling to everything. Capitol Hill made him feel like an extra in a movie that hired largely younger, more talented actors. The gallery really was a punctuation mark, a bright comma between a plant store and a place selling expensive doughnuts. Inside, the floor was clean enough to worship.

“What is it?” he asked Iris, but only with his eyebrows, which she understood. She grinned quick, then adjusted the knob on a small amp and the sound in the room shifted so that the air felt fat. People came in with expensive habits and appraised the vibrational idea and said things like, “It makes me feel like the room is leaning.” He stood near the back so he could watch without being watched.

When she talked about the work, Iris did not apologize. He admired that. She said, “We want the walls to sing back to us. They’re not just holding our houses up; they’re hearing us all the time. We could listen back.” She glanced at him and he made a face like, Go on, which felt like a private version of applause.

After, they walked the block with puffy coats zipped to the teeth and steam coming out of the vents into the cold night. She held a paper cup like it was a reliquary. “How’s the universe of pipes?”

“It’s piping,” he said. He tried out, “I am possibly unwell in the mind about bugs,” in his head, and it didn’t fit with the streetlight, he couldn’t find how to put it among the people walking their high-booted dogs. He said, “I had a weird thing with a wasp. Multiple wasps. It keeps haunting the inside of the job.”

She didn’t flinch. She said, “I once had a mouse run over my bare foot in a kitchen in Beacon Hill. I almost leveled the house.”

“That’s different,” he said.

“It is and isn’t,” she said. “You don’t need me to tell you that your nervous system loves you too much. It’s trying to make sure you outlive everything. I can write a song about it. But it won’t fix it. I can come down one day and go under a house with you. I’ll bring a drum. We’ll have a ceremonial bashing of fear.”

“You’ll make the walls sing,” he said, feeling foolish and dear all at once.

“I will,” she said. “And you will fix the thing that needed fixing. And then we will leave them to it. People forget houses continue without us.”

They stood on the curb, letting Seattle roar past, and he thought, He was going to say something about their father. He didn’t. Instead he said, “Sometimes I think if I changed everything at once, I would be different.”

“You would still be you,” she said. “But maybe you’d have a nicer hat.” She touched the brim of his cap, faded and sweat-stained and dear. “Come to my rehearsal Saturday. We’re trying a thing with a saxophonist who swears he can play without breathing. Watching that will cure you of some trouble or maybe give you new ones.”

“Saturday is crawling day,” he said, and then wished it back.

She bumped her shoulder against his shoulder. “You can also text me pictures of spiders and I’ll rate them. No less than three stars for effort from any spider, minimum. Otherwise, the spider will have a self-esteem issue and then what?”

What.

He drove back south with the night pressing on the windshield like a weight, and Tacoma rose up out of it with its own particular low glow like a friend slouching into a bar saying, Here we are again. He passed the Dome, absurd beast, and the rail yard, the trains lined up like a code he would never crack, and the Seahorse Motel’s flickering S.

In the morning, the smell of boiled pennies and seaweed and a rumor of smoke was there again, faint like an idea you could almost put your hand on. He rolled the window down and let it in. He had a crawlspace at nine a.m. He had a client who would talk about a cousin who’s allergic to everything. He had a step-sister whose music made his kitchen feel like some other room. He had a mind currently held hostage by wings and legs.

He had, if he was honest, some kind of beginning, which he did not want. He wanted a tidy middle. He went under the next house and did not meet a wasp. He met a hundred strands of web that draped his face, and he did not scream exactly. He made a sound like the squeak of a turning wheel that might have been in E-flat. He kept going anyway, each elbow placed on the timber as if it might refuse the touch. He talked to himself like he was two people, one in the lead and one coaxing. “Here we go,” he said. “Good job. It’s just a line. Just a line. It’s just part of the whole.”

Later that day he sat on the curb outside a bakery and texted Iris a picture of a spider the size of a fingernail in a web under a porch light, its legs GPS-precise. She wrote back, “Four stars. Deducting one for web placement. Web would be more effective on third level of firewall in the server room in the back, which, I realize, is not available. But still.”

He laughed out loud. The sound surprised him.

Char came out of the bar next door to smoke, saw him laughing at his phone, and raised an eyebrow. “You find Jesus in there?”

“Close enough,” he said, and stood up to go back to the van. He felt foolishly lighter, as if someone had adjusted a dimmer switch on a fear. It would brighten again. That was the honest fact. It would swing bright as a siren some days. But a man can get used to a siren. He can learn to keep going, his hands steady on the wrench, the wrench steady on the stubborn whatever behind the wall, the city outside trying its best to articulate itself in the language of gulls and trains and a music he didn’t yet know the notes of. He could, he told himself, even learn to hear a whole composition out of it. Like he knew where to place the elbows. That had to count for something.The week turned like a reluctant valve, quarter by patient quarter, until he found himself back on 6th with the smell of the waterway in his teeth and Lacy Mae’s narrow blue house blinking at him like an eyelid that had forgiven and forgotten. He had called her two days after the first visit, voice steady enough that he believed it, and told her he wanted another run at it after a pest company cleared the nest. She’d said yes like she wanted to say yes to most things, which moved his gratitude around inside him without giving it a place to settle. The crawlspace hatch was the same rectangle of suggestion; the lawn still steamed with dampness; the chewed corner was chewed a little more. He knocked, and she answered with the child on her hip and a dishcloth hanging from her shoulder like a badge, and when he said, “We’ll take care of it,” he meant both the plural of him and the woman walking up the path with a boxy backpack and a calm expression.

The exterminator’s name was Skye and she wore her hair in a long salt-brown braid that seemed proof of a steady hand. She smelled faintly of cedar and a chemical he could not name, and when he apologized for calling her out for a paper wasp nest like it was a war, she shook her head and said the thing he least expected, which was that people often apologized in that exact way and the nests were always more beautiful up close than the apologizers wanted to admit. She crouched by the hatch and clicked her headlamp to life as if she were going caving for treasure, then glanced at him and said, all friendliness and not a hint of dare, “If you want to see, I can show you the architecture before I bag it. Sometimes looking is better than swatting at the air.” He did want to see and also didn’t want to be someone who wanted to see; he nodded anyway and followed her face-down into the chalky dark.

He kept his weight on the board and his mind on the beam, the way he had been rehearing in his head, and watched the way Skye moved like the space was a long sentence she knew the grammar of. When her light found the nest, he felt his body do the small disastrous tightening that he had begun to notice in himself the way old men notice a change in the weather, but she did not let the moment tip into theater. She said, “Ancient architects, these,” like she was reading a field guide, and edged the light so he could see the spiraled tiers, the entrance like a cleanly cut buttonhole, the papery scales that were a history of chewed wood and summer work. There were wasps on it, yes, commas uncoiling just as before, and his breath threatened to leave him like a dog that didn’t like the argument, but Skye began to spray a fine mist into the air around the nest with a nonchalance that made the whole thing feel briefly domestic. Soap and water, she said, almost cheerful, breaks surface tension; wings can’t wing when the soap remembers them. They dropped, small and controlled, into the mouth of a long hose attached to the pack on her back, and the static in his ears eased from a hiss to a suggestion. Skye kept up the running commentary, quiet as a sound engineer. “They’re meaner than honeybees but smarter than we give them credit for. They hate certain smells. Mint, sometimes. Clove. They’re draftsmen with a temper.” He appreciated the word draftsmen, old-fashioned, square on the tongue. When it was done, she sealed the nest like it was a specimen for a museum and wrote on the bag with a marker, Foss Waterway P. dominula, 6th Ave, which made him want to sit at a wooden table under a green lamp and label things forever.

After the vacuum and the labeling and a mutual nod that was not quite a handshake, he lay on his belly again and went toward the problem he should have gone toward days ago. The main shut-off looked older now that he had fewer excuses; the sloppily soldered elbow winked at him like a joke that had waited long enough. He closed the valve and felt its slow give like a stubborn idea finally conceding, then cut the line at the elbow where it looked like flux had been an afterthought. The inside of the pipe had that furry look he both hated and loved, mineral bloom like barnacles, a story about water told by calcium. He scraped and saw the tiny hole like a worm’s two front teeth had gnawed it down; he thought, idly and then not idly, of arteries, of the way the body remembers every mistake. He pulled the length of copper out like a bad sentence, replaced it with a clean new run and a pair of press fittings that clicked in with an honesty he wanted to take home, and when he opened the valve and the line sang into fullness he felt a small chemical of triumph bloom under his skin. At the kitchen sink, the faucet stream went from a sulky thread to a proper plank, and Lacy Mae put her hand under it and made the face people make when a mechanical world suddenly decides to be reasonable.

The child on her hip made a serious O with her mouth and said, “Bee bye,” with a solemnity that made all of them laugh and let the tension leak out like a quiet air brake. Lacy kept thanking with increasing creativity, offering him muffins in a Tupperware the size of a helmet, the names of neighbors who would need work soon, and a discount on nothing because she had nothing to discount except her gratitude. He declined everything except the chance to put a small square of screen on the vent near the chewed crawlspace door and the suggestion that she call a pest guy about the wood itself, which was half advice and half an attempt to keep future versions of himself from encountering future tenants with wings. He wrote the invoice in the van with neat numbers, then sat and ate one of the muffins anyway, because even if he didn’t need it he did, and the smell of the waterway came through the cracked window like a stubborn radio station he would miss if it finally came in clear.

At the shop, Marta had that look like she was balancing five calendars in her head while a sixth fell out of a cupboard. She glanced up, took in the lack of panic on his face, and slid a stack of printed tickets toward him with a gentleness that was almost apology. She had made all the jokes already and he had already endured them, so now they were in the plain language part of a friendship where mostly what you say is what needs saying. She said the afternoon held two water heater swaps and a crawl in a house that had been a summer rental, which meant it would smell like arguments and sunscreen, and he said he’d take the swap first. She let him, because it mattered and because she had her own list of fears and they did not include being called soft for letting a decent man stage his way back toward the hard thing. In a quiet minute, while the printer spit out a label crookedly, she mentioned without looking at him that the union was taking applicants again and she’d put his name on the list when he’d been on the fence last winter. He knew the union was security and health insurance and the particular kind of family that will fight you and for you in the same hour, and he also knew that he liked the shaky independence of making decisions inside the van’s mobile cathedral. He said, “Someday,” careful and not dismissive, and she said, “Someday is a lovely place and very far away,” and then they both had to get back to work.

He went to Iris’s rehearsal in a church basement that used to be something else, maybe a community hall or a school gym, with a wood floor that creaked at every other plank and a Jesus with shockingly kind eyes painted on a mural that had lived through several coats of neglect. The saxophonist was a woman with a shaved head and a tattoo of a metronome on her wrist, and her name was Larkin like a poet, which felt like the sort of thing you are not allowed to make up. Iris introduced them with the ease of someone who enjoyed the idea that strangers could meet and make something on purpose. When he asked about the trick of playing without breathing, Larkin smiled with her mouth shut, one corner going up, then explained circular breathing slowly enough that he could picture the mechanics and not get lost. She spoke of cheeks ballooning like bellows, of moving air in storage, of smoothing the seam where inhale and exhale shook hands so the sound didn’t notice the exchange. He liked the language of that, the sneaky honesty of it, and he realized in a sideways part of his brain that he had been trying his own version under houses, holding the old breath and letting a new one in without making a noise that woke the nest. He told Larkin she must be part plumber, the way she kept the line, and she laughed and said she respected anyone who could make water go where it was told without violence.

They ran through a piece that made the walls do exactly what Iris had promised, which was something between groan and hymn. He carried folding chairs and found his steps syncing with the drummer’s practice runs, and for an ungenerous second he wondered what kind of money could come from making walls sing. He interrupted himself internally to remember that money was only one measure and a stupid one in certain rooms, and then the drummer hit the snare with a brush in a way that sounded like a soft argument and he thought, Actually, this pays in the coin I don’t know the name of. When a moth came out from the cold and started worrying the fluorescent light, his body tried out the usual alarm, but Larkin lifted a finger without breaking a phrase, and the drummer stood and cupped the moth gently in his hand and let it go near the open door. It seemed theatrical and also simply kind, and the two truths sat next to each other without fighting. Nate’s shoulders dropped a fraction he hadn’t noticed they were raised.

The call that night was the kind he used to like because it made a clear shape out of time. A restaurant on Pacific had a leak in the wall behind the prep sink, not a drip but a wet insistence that had turned the drywall into cake. He went with Maggie, who could fit inside any space and who had a look like she’d been born inside a tool bag and found it to her liking. They cut the panel and a mouse ran the exact wrong direction, which was up and toward them, and it was somehow comical and not comical in the way particular realities are, but Maggie did not judge his brief and unlovely noise when it vaulted. “Don’t worry,” she said dry as a bone. “He’s late for church.” The joint was a compression fitting whose compression had given up; the line had been improperly deburred by someone with more bravado than patience. He fixed it while the restaurant hummed around him with the fragile desperation of dinner service, and when they were done the chef offered them both Roman-style slices he called his penance and they took them out back and ate next to clean dumpsters that smelled like they would smell awful in summer. Maggie smoked, held the smoke in a way that seemed like it was telling the story rather than being the story, and said she’d heard about his wasps. He started to defend himself and she stopped him with a palm and called him kid even though he wasn’t, then told him about the time a raccoon had stared at her under an old duplex while she crawled backward with a pipe wrench as if she were leaving a fancy party in reverse. She said the truth was you stayed in, or you got out, and either way you got paid because someone had to do it, and mostly the doing mattered more than the size of the fear. “Besides,” she added, flicking ash with decisive flick, “you don’t have to like the thing to get past it, you just have to know its name and keep saying it like a prayer until it turns into a broom.”

On Saturday, he took a call in a tidy bungalow that had settled and slanted so slowly the family did not feel it, the way you don’t feel the ocean rising while you stand on the shore and tell yourself you are taller. The complaint was slow drains and a smell in the bathroom like wet pennies, a phrase that made him like and not like the couple who lived there, because it meant they noticed and cared. He found a small invasion of roots in the cast iron, beautiful in a sick way, tender new growth tasting the iron as if it were a mineral buffet. He threaded the snake into the line and took his time, breathing in a pattern that would have looked odd if anyone had been watching, cheeks slightly full, chest barely moving, the hum of a circular breath making its own low frequency inside him. The roots resisted and then gave like an argument that realizes it has no place to go, and when he pulled the coil back the wet green came with it, shining like a secret garden in a nursery rhyme. He more than half expected a small arthropod chorus to launch a counterattack, and when a millipede did appear in the corner of his vision he counted the screws on the escutcheon in a tone he tried to keep respectful of millipedes everywhere, which, he had to admit, was a sentence that had not occurred to him last year.

Troy hovered that afternoon in a way that meant he had either gossip or a favor to ask. They were both too old for whatever pecking order they performed around the coffee pot, but you could be too old for something and still wear it like a jacket in a room that insisted on being cold. He opened with a line about insects that was almost clever and then stuck around, flicking his lighter and closing it, flicking and closing, until Nate said, “What?” because the fastest way around a mountain is sometimes through. Troy didn’t quite meet his eye when he said his cousin had nearly died from a sting in a hay barn at thirteen and everyone had made fun of his aunt for carrying an EpiPen everywhere until the day she had been late for the fair and then nobody laughed for a long time. He said it like a confession disguised as anecdote, then finished with a shrug that waved toward the portion of the room that never forgave anyone for sincerity longer than two seconds. Nate found himself saying that he would take the crawl Troy was pretending to hate for the next morning if Troy would answer one question truly, and the question was why he called people by their last names when it wasn’t a ball field. Troy laughed for real and said if you call men by their first names they will tell you their whole life in the time you need to be turning on a shut-off, as if he had been dying to say it. It was not exactly an answer, but it was a good one.

That night rain came down with commitment and he liked it for reducing the city to a polite whisper. He got a call just after ten from a church with a basement used now by a dozen things, none of which were worship, where a pipe had let go in a way that made the building’s oldest bones weep. He went because he liked the night jobs for how they made the day jobs seem less dramatic, and because he had been thinking of walls that sing and wanted to see how a basement sounded when it begged. The stairs were wooden and the smell of the place was thick in the way of old paint and old books, and when he waded ankle-deep toward the shut-off he did not pretend there were no roaches. There were, and they made their unreadable decisions near the edges of the light, and he closed his mouth around the vowel of panic and moved his breath not just in his chest but in the tender places behind his nose and under his tongue, the way Larkin had shown with a cheeks-out breath. He turned the valve, which fought like a thing that had been ignored and developed a personality to compensate, and he could feel the water in the pipes stop like a song whose last note hangs for a beat longer than you expect. The walls did not sing exactly, but they emitted a sound between sigh and creak that translated to relief in every imaginable language, and he stood there in his wet boots and let the ridiculous pride of having prevented a small catastrophe fill him as much as it wanted.

Sunday afternoon, he drove to a cemetery with a thermos and no idea what he was supposed to say to the stone that had replaced his father. The grass was too green in a way that felt like someone had overcorrected, and the wind pushed through firs with the sound of distance. He poured coffee and felt like his father would have made fun of that, then corrected himself, because the man had been less predictable than any myth allowed and had watched late-night meteor showers like a pilgrim. He said it out loud, that he might not be all right, then only felt dramatic and silly and started over by telling the story of the wasps as if the dead needed it, which he doubted and didn’t. He laughed at himself twice, quiet laughs that were like a cough, and said in the new calm voice that seemed to live somewhere in his throat now that he was trying to use it, that he knew the difference between something that could kill him and something that wanted to. He poured a little of the coffee into the ground because the men he had known had always poured a little out for someone somewhere, and on the drive back he did not play the radio because the engine and the tires and the rain were saying something worth hearing if you shut up long enough.

The following week gave him work that was politely complicated and human in the way that didn’t make for stories and therefore made for a better life. He installed a utility sink in a laundry room where the wallpaper still believed the eighties could revive if given second-stage CPR and a generous budget, and he listened to an older man tell him how his wife had gotten good at finding the cheapest lilies in the city by accident. He tightened a shower valve that had been weeping so long the tile was developing a kind of white blossom and a geometry he could not name, and he told the teenager who stood in the doorway like a disapproving angel that this would make the water less hot all at once and more reasonable over time, and the boy nodded as if a lesson about life had been disguised as hardware. He crawled under a run of townhouses where the insulation sagged like defeated pillows and the ground smelled of rot with intentions, and he got stuck for a full eight seconds when his belt caught on a nail and he thought his heart would feel stupid if it stopped for a nail, then he backed his body up inch and patience until he was free and laughed at the plank he laid down like an apology when he went forward again.

He bought a cheap harmonica at a pawn shop because it was the right size to fit in a pocket and because the man behind the counter said it had been cleaned so often it was nearly spiritual. He did not know how to play, but you could make a single clean tone and it wouldn’t judge you, and he liked the idea of carrying a noise-maker meant only for breath. In the van at stoplights he put it to his mouth and pulled air through it until it did not feel like a trick and the tone wobbled less than the day before, and he had the small thought, a kind of ridiculous one, that practicing one sound might be like keeping one promise. When a fly landed on the rearview and cleaned its hands with too much diligence, he told himself he could become the kind of man who could let the fly finish its ablutions without reading into them, then wavered and rolled the window down and shooed it out with the sleeve of his flannel. This counted, he decided, as both kindness and cowardice, which was fine since most of his choices had that exact mix and nobody had died of it yet.

On a Wednesday, Troy was the one who made a noise in a crawl, which startled both of them, because Troy’s noises were usually the kind that came with a grin. He had gone under a small rental near the college where the furnace had kicked heat into a colony of most of a decade’s dust, and the smell had pitched in a way that made him gag and then panic and then gasp around the gag, which is a difficult sequence for any body at any age. Nate was by the hatch with the meter and the calm look he had practiced on himself, and he found himself laying it on someone else like a coat because that was, apparently, how that worked, and was surprised by how quickly it fit. He said the words to Troy that he had been saying to the inside of his own skull, not perfect and not magic but correct enough: you can back up, the board is there, put your hand where you see the nail head, there you go, your shoulder next, breathe in one place and out in another, perfect, perfect, you absolute champion of getting out of places. By the time Troy’s boots appeared in the hatch they were both sweating like fathers in a delivery room, and Troy lay on the crooked grass and swore at the excellent sky and then told the sky nothing personal. They didn’t talk about it later, because men in trucks are obliged by an old unkind law to skip the post-game, but Troy stopped using the Bug Hollis name unless he also used Nate first, as though the two parts had to live in the same sentence to make any sense.

When Iris texted a photo of a hand-drawn poster for a performance in a place in Seattle that was less a room than an idea, he said yes to the invitation without drafting any other reply first, and then did the oddest thing he had done in months, which was to sit and consider buying a ticket for the train rather than driving. He imagined not being the engine of his own movement down the corridor between two cities that had been cousins and rivals since their births; he imagined the train’s hum and the small drinks and the chance to look out and see not just the road but the water and its long argument with the land. He did not buy the ticket, not that day, because the time did not line up and the jobs did not either, and because habit is a species that never appears in field guides and yet is everywhere. He kept thinking about it, however, which felt like making room for a future version of himself who might make slightly different mistakes.

The next crawlspace offered him nothing in the way of redemption and everything in the way of practice. He went in after lunch, which he had learned sometimes made it worse because your stomach does not want you to flatten it after you fill it, and the air under that particular house smelled of damp rope, old lettuce, and something like canned heat. There were webs of the fine kind that do not announce themselves until they are on your lip, and the thicker kind that suggest a spider’s optimism about geography, and he wore a hat this time because he was not an idiot twice on purpose. He did not love being under there and never would, and he did not manage anything so cinematic as forgetting that fact, but he also did not bolt when a pill bug unscrolled near his wrist and walked like a miniature armored god away from his very large face. He said out loud, because the air liked being talked to, “Not for you, not for me, we’re both just crossing,” and then laughed at himself because he heard the sentence as though he were in a movie where people were nicer than they are.

At the end of the day, he stopped by The Mule for a drink he planned not to finish because he wanted the room more than the beer. Char had braided her hair around her head in a way that made her look like she had borrowed a crown and then earned it. She slid him something darker than his mood and told him she had decided to try to play the bass again even though the bass had always made her feel like a joke in the wrong language. He told her about the harmonica and expected the eye roll and got instead a look like the first real light after a storm. She said breath is the most interesting instrument because it is the only one you can’t set down on the bar and forget, and then she flipped a glass over her shoulder into a rack and it made a sound that felt like agreement. In the corner, an old song about trains tried to make everyone remember something they had not personally lived through, and a woman at the end of the bar cried quietly into a napkin because sometimes the word train is enough for sadness to hang its jacket.

Back in the van, he held the harmonica again and played one note that behaved itself and two that did not, then tucked it under the dash next to the wrench whose magnet had failed, which he still had not fixed and maybe never would because the clank had become a kind of metronome for the days. He drove with the window cracked, because he always would if he could help it, and the air moved across his face smelling like pennies and kelp and smoke in a way that made him say thank you to no one. He had not turned a corner; he had negotiated one; it was different and not different at all. He went home, and the carts rattled outside his window, and someone’s bass thumped like a heart that had not learned to go easy, and he slept for hours without the slap of his own palm against his face, and in the morning a spider had made a web between the mirror and the corner of his window, delicate architecture trying to make a living in a hard town, and he stood there a full minute, late, watching the sunlight catch on it like a stringed instrument tuned to a frequency he could almost hear. He blew gently, so gently, and the web trembled but did not break, and he thought, here we are, you and me, with our terrible and beautiful plans. He left it, because there are things you are allowed to leave if you promise to watch where you’re going, and the day welcomed him like it does when it is feeling merciful and the phone already had two messages waiting.Chapter 4

The first message was from Marta and had that tone she reserved for fires that were not technically fires. She needed him at the old theater on Broadway, the one with the ceiling painted like a sky that never quite convinced anyone, because water was coming through a light fixture backstage and the stage manager had said a joke about doing “Singin’ in the Rain” for real, ha ha, and then had used three exclamation points. The second was from Iris, time-stamped just after midnight, a voice note of streetcars squealing into corners, followed by text: “Do you have access to rooms that hum? Preferably legal access. Also, can you record a water hammer? Not the traumatic kind, the interesting kind.” He listened to the streetcar voices, the metal negotiating radius. It sounded like a flock of birds that were also knives. He stood there in his socks with the thermos lid in his hand and the little web at the window anchored to its corners like a geometry puzzle he had no interest in solving. “You picked a good spot,” he told the spider without moving his mouth too much, then reached for the phone and texted Iris back that he might have both, given a cooperative day.

The theater had a caretaker named Mrs. Page who had been wearing a name tag since the Carter administration by the look of her, though he suspected it was a uniform of personality more than history. She met him in the lobby with a ring of keys that looked like it could open memories and a cardigan that had given up on pretending it was not a blanket. The building smelled like old velvet and varnish and that sweet tired scent paper has after a century of being turned by careful hands. She walked quickly, her feet making soft impatient sounds on the carpet, and he followed through a series of doors that said Authorized in gold letters that had become a suggestion. Backstage, a gel rack leaned like a rainbow gone disorderly, the fly lines were ranked like a harp waiting to be tuned, and a line of grocery-store cookies sat on a table with a note that said For Crew in a handwriting that was trying hard not to be a threat.

“It’s here,” she said, pointing to a spreading stain that made a flower out of the corner where wall met ceiling. “If I have to put a bucket in the wings, I will resign and become an accountant. The children’s theater matinee is at three. We cannot have rain on orphans.” She said it like she had personal animosity toward rain and orphans both.

Nate traced the path with his eyes, felt the walls the way he’d teach a student to feel for studs. The pipes in old theaters were an improvisation—additions made for star dressing rooms, for new bathrooms to accommodate fancier audiences, for changing the way a building once meant for candles consented to electricity. The supply lines were galvanized and copper in promiscuous marriages; the drains were cast iron that had made its own mineral caves inside. He could see where a run had been added through the stage-left wall and then buried behind a skin of plywood for a renovation that had a budget only for applause. Somewhere inside that hidden passage a compression fitting or an old union had woken up in the night and decided it wanted to remember its separate parts.

“It’ll be under the stage,” he said. “Probably the crawl under the orchestra pit. I might need to make a hole if the trap door is stuck.”

“It is always stuck,” she said with a sigh. “As a rule, about everything here. You and I will regret our fondness for old things until we are old things.”

He found the trap door by the tradition of looking where tradition would hide it: behind stacked flats painted to look like parlors and alleyways. He levered it up with the bar that lived on a nail nearby and told himself quietly that this was not a summons but an invitation. The air that came up had the cold-iron smell of accumulated winter and the acidic tang of mouse, but it lacked the bright paper smell of wasps. For a second that absence made him want to weep with gratitude as if silence had handed him a cup of water. He put his hat on because he had become a man who put his hat on in these moments; he clipped his light to the brim; he took his harmonica and slid it into the front pocket of his shirt like a talisman he was still deciding whether to believe in.

The space under the stage was taller than most crawls, a shallow room more than a tunnel, with joists running like sentences in an old book that still made sense. Dust floated where his light disturbed it. A row of storage crates hunkered along one wall with labels like ACT II STAIR UNIT and GRAVEYARD SMALL. The drip was not hard to find; a wet shining line drew a diagonal on the plywood skin in the back corner like a note someone had left for him without the bother of words. He crab-walked to it, keeping his body angles careful, feeling for nails with his knee instead of discovering them the ugly way. When he put his ear to the thin wall it sounded like a faint hiss, a whisper through one tooth. He thought of Larkin describing cheeks as bellows, of moving breath from one chamber to the other without the note knowing, and he found himself matching his inhale to that hiss until it no longer sounded like a problem and more like a companion.

He cut a neat square with the oscillating saw, the tool vibrating the bones of his hand so that his father’s knuckles briefly visited him, and the piece came away obediently, exposing a run of pipe too close to a heat source for anyone’s code. The fitting was white with mineral, a frost in a place that never saw winter, and a shiny trail led from its underside like evidence written in cursive. He had the impulse to apologize out loud to the building and then laughed at himself because sentimentality for houses was like sentimentality for appliances: not wrong, just comical to people who hadn’t felt it. He put a tray beneath, cracked the joint carefully, and when the water wept out he murmured, “There it is,” the way a person says “Found you” to a child hiding too well and starting to be afraid of their own game.

He replaced the fitting with a proper union, cleaned the threads like he was polishing language, doped and taped and pressed with a seriousness he could feel in his shoulders. He rerouted the run two inches from the hot surface and strapped it properly because theater fire is a version of hell he could prevent. When he brought the line up slowly, listening for the shift inside like a piano tuner tapping a string, he felt the building’s gratitude not as a feeling but as a change in the way the air sat. He had trained himself to listen for that. It had taken a decade and a half and there were still days when he had to be reminded by the drip hitting his cheek.

Mrs. Page’s voice came muffled through the stage. “Well?”

“Give me two minutes,” he called back, because he didn’t trust victory until it had sat still in the room with him for a breath. He took his phone out, thumbed to record, and held it near the line while he shut the valve and popped it open again in a controlled way that made the pipes tremble and then settle. The sound was a little like thunder practicing scales and a little like a son clearing his throat before he tells a truth. He sent it to Iris with a caption that felt as close to poetry as he would allow himself on a workday: “Orchestra pit in E. Or A. Something agreeable.”

When he came up, Mrs. Page put a hand on his arm in a gesture that hovered between maternal and professional and said, “I will name something after you in the wings if that does not violate union rules.” He almost told her to name the trap door, which had already been named, he was sure, in words not spoken in polite rooms, but instead he wiped his hands, wrote down the particulars, and asked if he could hear the room empty for a second. She understood the request without asking him to make it less strange for her. They stood in the center of the stage, under the fake sky, and the room hummed because rooms do, quietly, if you stand still long enough. He almost took the harmonica out, then didn’t, because the quiet felt like a brave animal and he didn’t need to scare it.

He sent the invoice from the van because time was not a concept that respected poetry. Marta texted back a thumbs-up filled with a capital M energy, followed by another address and the words “repeat slow drain/tenant claims ‘something alive’,” which he read with the appropriate skepticism. He drank the last of the thermos coffee like penance and realized it had cooled into something like sorrow. He didn’t mind. Sorrow kept you humble in your victories. He drove toward the new address with the steady patience of a man who had already lifted a trap door that morning and found the thing that lived behind it manageable.

The tenant who had said something alive turned out to be a grad student with a bob and a shirt that said The Future Is A Body. She showed him a bathroom with a pedestal sink that wobbled because the screws had hit nothing substantial and a tub that tapped when you set your foot inside as if it had a small bell under it. She confessed to feeding a sourdough starter more faithfully than she watered her plants and asked if that made her a traitor to green things. He met the tub drain with the small head of the snake and talked to it under his breath with the ease of long acquaintance, and when the clog relinquished a slick gob of hair and soap that looked like a seal’s nightmare, something small did indeed scuttle away from the flange. It was only a roach, as ordinary as a sentence about the weather, but it had that roach arrogance that read as malice if you needed it to. He kept his breath in his cheeks while his chest did something else and counted the grooves on the chrome cap until the urge to bolt eased from a siren to a dial tone. The student asked if she should move, and he said no in a voice that was so calm it sounded fake to his own ear. He told her to get traps and keep the food invisible and to stop throwing coffee grounds in the disposal like she was feeding a pet. She thanked him by confiding that she thought sound could move plaster, which he found both ridiculous and possibly true.

At the shop, a box sat on his bench with his name and a drawing of something with too many legs. For a second he thought Troy had reverted to a twelve-year-old. The box held, instead of a prank, a set of snap-on screens for foundation vents and a note in Maggie’s handwriting that said: “A broom with another name. Don’t let them in where you can help it.” He smiled in a way that used different muscles than he gave to customers and slid the screens into the van next to the press tool and the bucket that had started to look permanent. He could feel the day working on him in a way that wasn’t just fatigue, more like an adjustment to a hinge that had been sticking. His body had kept the morning’s posture, the under-stage caution, but his mind had not taken every squeak as a threat. He pocketed that thought as a thing to show to no one and everyone.

Skye called while he was putting the receipt folder back in the glovebox, as if some portion of the day had decided to tie its threads in a bow. She had three house calls near the waterway and an extra hour. Did he want a quick tutorial on identifying nests versus the structure of paper-wasp adolescent dreams? He wanted to say absolutely not and also yes more than anything because knowing the shape of a fear made it a smaller god. They met in the parking lot at a taco truck that was good in the way of things that never advertised because they did not need to. She opened the back of her truck and showed him laminated sheets with drawings of combs, differentiated like a field guide for architecture. She kept calling parts by names that seemed made up—pedicel, petiole, clypeus—and he let the syllables wash over him like someone else’s night prayer. She said soap again, with the soft authority of a woman who had learned what works by trial and by a lab that smelled like mint, and he asked if her work made her less afraid or more, and she said neither, that it had moved the fear from the center of the room to a stool near the door where it might or might not be asked to leave. He liked that, because it matched how he felt about the harmonica, which still sounded mostly like a reed trying to be a bird and failing but also laughing about it.

He took the harmonica out that night at The Mule while Char argued gently with a man who wanted to call a pale beer something aggressive so he could feel bolder ordering it. The bar had learned his one-note trick and tolerated it because there were worse peccadillos and the tip jar did not discriminate. He held the instrument like a screw he hadn’t chosen yet and bent the note the smallest fraction, enough to feel it go pliant under his mouth. Char, from across the bar, gave him a look that said Not bad in a language only built in rooms with low ceilings and too many conversations. An older couple next to him debated train routes like theologians, and for a minute he let the idea of taking the train to Seattle tomorrow enter the room and sit with them. He watched its shadow on the wall and didn’t shoo it away.

The next morning, he bought a ticket on his phone before he could consult the chorus of reasons not to. The act felt ridiculous and extravagant and exactly like the sort of thing he had decided belonged to different men, men whose wallets contained restaurant receipts with dates on them and train tickets left there on purpose. He parked the van near the station where someone had added a graffiti crown to the statue of a man nobody remembered and he tried not to read meaning into the crown. On the platform, the rails sang the way they do when a train is far off, the frequency more felt than heard, a suggestion rather than a sentence. He did not lick his finger and hold it up and declare the note, but he wanted to. Old men compared weather with spit and fingers; he compared sound with the part of him that had begun to practice believing in his own ears. When the train arrived, a rush of air walked past them all and everyone leaned into it without admitting they were leaning. He took a seat by the window because that’s what you do unless someone else outruns you to it, and as the city unrolled like a blueprint under glass he put his phone against the window and recorded the hum. He texted it to Iris before he could decide it was silly, and she wrote back in the time it took for a cloud to reveal an industrial yard: “This is an F pretending to be a C. It’s a liar and a saint. Thank you.”

Seattle was itself, which is to say a busy and performative version of the wet. He met Iris at a café that smelled like ambition and cardamom, and she had under her arm a stack of paper like music but not. She kissed his cheek and wrinkled her nose and told him he had turned into someone who owns a train ticket and he was not allowed to go back. They went to a space under a space that required three keys and an apology, where she and Larkin and a small pack of admirers had decided to make the ducts sing. He watched while she cajoled the building into revealing its note, tapping the vents with a rubber mallet until the sound rounded out and everyone made the small delighted noises people make when they recognize a frequency they didn’t know they’d been missing. He found himself more proud than cautious about how foreign and beautiful the whole enterprise would sound to his father. He did not name the feeling.

He took the last train home, which meant the corridor of water and warehouse had put on its midnight. The van waited where he’d left it like a dog that had learned there would be returns. The city did its low brass thing and the air had that late-hour quiet that isn’t really quiet but a rearrangement of noises into a different constellation. He opened his door and noticed without drama a daddy longlegs moving with the improbable gentleness they have along the inside of the windshield as if it were patrolling a perimeter. He didn’t flinch and he didn’t practice heroism either. He opened the other door and gave it time and watched it choose a direction that was not his lap. He said, to no one, “Good job,” and started the engine.

Work found him again like it usually did, with the slightly embarrassed voice of a woman who had not flushed a single paper towel down the toilet but whose children had friends, and the more insistent voice of a landlord who had discovered that hot water heaters do not live forever no matter how much manifesting you do. He went under and over and inside and around. He let himself be the man you call when you need water to be better behaved. He tried not to take on the tone of a confessor and failed now and then. Once, in a hundred-year-old fourplex near the park, he opened a plaster wall and released a cloud of powder that made him look like a statue of a worker in a socialist parade. A thing with too many legs darted left and then right and then, offended by his existence, into a crack. He did not follow with his imagination. He thought instead, because he had trained himself to, of the first time someone had thought of putting hot and cold on either side of a faucet so that even a child could understand which was which just by reaching, and he gave thanks to that person, ridiculous thanks that belonged perhaps in a church for saints of kitchens.

On a Thursday it rained hard enough that even the kind of people who professed to love rain admitted defeat and swore at their choices. A school called because a bathroom had become a lake, and he ran into a hallway that could have been any hallway in any public building in the Northwest and found a flood that was not catastrophic but was committed. A row of children watched with the solemnity of jurors as he shut the supply and the lake turned into an idea. One of them asked if he was a firefighter and he said no and the kid looked disappointed and he added that sometimes he wrestled dragons in basements and the disappointment turned into calculation about whether a dragon would fit under the school. The janitor showed him a mop closet where time had stopped in 1993 and the wall behind the mop rack had softened into a suggestion. He cut into it and mended the line and swallowed the web that kissed his cheek and let it be a kiss. He went home wet to the bone and sat on the edge of his bed and let the day leave him like a tide leaving a field. The spider at the window had rebuilt after a week of being in the way and not, and he considered the patience required. He wondered what it would be to live on patience and small uninvited blessings. He supposed he was learning.

When a Saturday came unencumbered by the shop and by calls, he drove out to the tide flats because they reminded him of maps he couldn’t read and because the smell was honest. Freight moved in the middle distance like an animal that was not interested in him at all. He parked where the road had given up being road and became a decision, and he stood there with the harmonica in his pocket and took it out, finally, without apology to the gulls or the air. He bent a note gently into the wind and it came back changed, and he did it again, and again. In his head, he made a list of the tools he trusted: the press gun, the basin wrench, the flashlight that worked after being dropped, the harmonica he was turning into something like a tool, the tone he had been practicing in his own head for when he found himself somewhere small with something that wanted to stand on his lip and be counted. He made it a prayer in the way of men who pretend not to pray. He put the harmonica away and walked back to the van with the day ahead of him, a series of doors that would open because he had the keys or because he was now, finally, someone who would knock and wait the right amount of time.Chapter 5

Frost made lace of the window screen the first morning the city admitted it was winter, and Nate stood in his socks watching the light make a brief cathedral of it before the heat from the apartment undid the architecture. The spider that had claimed the corner weeks ago was absent or invisible; he found himself hoping it had relocated high and comfortable instead of having been persuaded by cold into bad decisions. The harmonica sat on the sill where he had left it, a small rectangle catching the same light, and he picked it up and breathed a note so quiet it almost didn’t form, the sound hiding inside the metal until it realized it was allowed out. The air in his mouth felt dry and clean and mean with the cold, and he thought of Larkin’s ballooning cheeks and the way she had made a seam vanish. His phone buzzed on the dresser with a text from Iris: “I might get a micro-residency if I propose a piece mapping the hidden tones of Tacoma. Jury loves maps. Do you have, like, keys to the chlorinated kingdom? Also: do you want to be my collaborator? I pay in notoriety and mushrooms.” He pictured a grant panel nodding at the phrase hidden tones, heard Marta’s laugh in his head at the idea of efficiencies married to art, and typed back, “I can ask for legal doors. Chlorine is a color on the tongue. Yes to collaborator if collaborator can lift two-by-fours and knows where to find Janice who unofficially runs the pump station.”

The shop had gone into its winter posture in small ways; the men wore thicker flannels and had adopted a communal disdain for gloves that went stiff between calls, and Marta kept a space heater under the desk that sang a high note of danger next to the spaghetti of cords. Work changed shape with the season. Less irrigation, more fundamentals. Heat. Hot water. Roof penetrations that had become jokes on the roof’s part. The calendar that lived on the whiteboard had solidified into blocks, and he could feel the whole small crew becoming one animal, shaggy and practical. He did two water heaters before lunch—the first in a garage where the previous owner had attempted insulation with old quilts and faith, the second in a closet that had been built around the tank so perfectly that he had to take the door off and then the jamb and then, because he had contracted himself into a metaphor, the hinge of his own patience. The day asked endurance, not finesse, and he gave it both out of habit.

At noon, a daycare called from a rambling house near 12th that had been painted yellow in summer as if color were a hedge against gray. “We have a sink that only sighs,” the director said, and when he stepped into the entry he was smacked by the dizzying combination of finger-paint, bleach, and cheerfulness he always forgot he liked. The room was an explosion of small shoes and taped-on art that made a riot of the alphabet. The sink in question had a tailpiece that had been hand-tightened by a person with good intentions and a bad relationship with threads, and the P-trap held glitter like a crime scene for fairies. A child in a dinosaur shirt watched him with devotional attention, as if his wrench were a magic talisman that would reveal to him the true character of adults. When a silverfish skidded out from behind the baseboard, a tiny fast thought of his heart being a rabbit took him by the scruff, and he had the odd kindness to tell himself, silently and out loud at the same time, that he could feel that and also still turn the nut. He did. The kid said, “You fixed the sparkle,” which was not technically correct and exactly right.

Skye had left him a voicemail the night before that he’d saved without hitting play, because saving was a way of admitting permission for later. He listened now, sitting on the tailgate of the van in the daycare gravel while children shouted verbs at one another. “Hey, Hollis. Friend of mine has a nest in the false attic of a boathouse near Point Defiance. Big one. They don’t want poison because of the ducks and the notion of the word organic. If you want to see it up close and not die, I could use an extra set of ears. Tonight after ten.” He called her back and said yes before he could consult his committee and then told Marta he had a night errand that was not illicit. Marta pretended not to be curious. She was.

The boathouse looked like a postcard that had studied, out over black water that reflected nothing except a long stripe of municipal light. The owner, a man in a flannel so sharp it could cut, had left a note on the door that said, “Skye—use side.” Inside, the air had the damp cedar smell of old lake places and a cold that felt like intention. Skye had brought a second suit and held it up like a joke. “You want the whole ensemble or the cameo?” she asked, and he took the cameo because too much fabric would be worse than the idea of stings. He fit the hood and the goggles and kept his breath small and slow in his sternum. Skye moved with her normal monastery calm, and the first sight of the nest was almost comic because of its audacity. It hung from the false rafters like a chandelier that had opinions, a gourd with a complicated zipper. Sound came off it the way heat comes off summer roads. He had been in orchestras tuning into that exact note, that close to dissonance, but obedient to some shared hunger for pitch.

“Bald-faced hornets,” Skye murmured, because talking quiet around danger was a religion. “Mean on principle but straightforward. Don’t swat. Don’t be a wind. I’ll cut the pedicel and you’ll take the bag like you’re catching a planet. Then we’ll have a second planet for stragglers.” He nodded, throat dry, and found his hands knew the shape they would need to take. The bag was a white drawstring affair that looked like institutional mercy. When she cut, the whole world tipped toward him like a surprise party and the bag took it with a gust and a sound like a stadium ten blocks away. One hornet found the crease of his glove and his wrist and lodged there like a misplaced comma. It stung, fast and uninterested in being a moral. He watched the thought that he was about to die arrive at the door of his mind like a salesman and then watched himself decide not to let it in. He breathed the cheeks-breath and the odd under-tongue breath and looked at the line of the dock through the open hatch and counted the boards. Skye’s voice was in his ear with a running tally of calm. “Good. Hold. That’s it. You’re a wall. You’re a wall that doesn’t argue.” When the bag held the nest and the second bag held the would-be lawyers, she set both down like sleeping infants and peeled her hood back. “You okay?” she asked, and he flexed the joint where the sting had smarted like a slammed finger. He waited for the movie to start—throat closing, light going tunnel—and instead got a steady burning that felt almost biblical in its insistence. “I’m okay,” he said aloud and then listened to his body for the lie. There wasn’t one, and the absence felt like a rich person tipping in cash.

They sat in the truck after, heater on, hands cupped around paper cups of mint tea that Skye produced from her glove compartment as if she had anticipated every need a human might have at midnight by water. She told him about a childhood near orchards, about summer jobs in barns where the dust made its own theology, about a mother who had died reaching for the radio, and he did not earn any of that but he accepted it like a neighbor’s pie. He told her, because he had to earn something, about the harmonica and about his father’s eyebrows and about a woman in a theater who would name a trap door after him if she owned the hallway to consequences. “You’re doing the right kind of wrong,” Skye said, which made no sense and all the sense. She handed him a small vial that contained oil that sniffed like peppermint and something sharp that took his breath and bent it. “For your hat brim,” she said. “If you feel a wing and need a thought.”

Between night and morning, the city felt paused the way a heart feels between beats when it wants to be dramatic just to remind you that it can. He drove home past empty bus stops and a construction site that stood like a practice skeleton in a doctor’s office. He slept so hard he bit his cheek and woke to the iron taste and the brief confusion about whether the air had been in the room before he was. The sting made an honest welt, red and stupid on his wrist, and for a second he admired it the way you admire a bruise that proves you went a place. He texted Skye that his arm was idling but not plotting revenge, and she sent back a string of emojis that managed to be funnier than words because one of them was a trumpet.

Iris’s residency application needed words like deliverable and concept and community, but whenever they talked about it they lapsed into sentences like, “What if we mic the inside of a city pipe and build a choir of faucets?” He laughed at how quickly he had become a person who could speak that sentence without flinching and then called Janice at the pump station to ask for favors he couldn’t afford. Janice said, “If you make my pumps famous, I want my name in the credits and you bring donuts,” which in public service language was a yes. He and Iris planned to go on a Tuesday when the flow would be unpredictable in a useful way. He printed out the permission email because legal paper made his body looser in a way that reminded him how much of life had felt like a trespass before someone handed him a key.

The storm that week came loud. Wind combed what the city thought was permanent and found a few seams. Rain didn’t arrive; it shouldered in. Calls stacked up until Marta wove her hair into a knot like she meant to fight. Backflows in basements, gutters vomiting into crawlspaces, the smell of penance rising from every wonky trap in town. He took a van into the south end and spent a day in a kind of ballet, lifting, turning, calling for someone to bring a bigger pump, carrying boxes of family photographs for a woman who kept saying “oh my god” as if the phrase could be an oar. In one basement, the roaches did the biblical thing of arriving as a chorus, and he noticed himself noticing and then not letting the noticing run the show. He sent Maggie for the big pump and made a game of the hose with a child too small to understand the edges of catastrophe; he had the kid hold the nozzle so that the water went out as a clean and directed force, asked him to aim at a chalk line he drew on the concrete. The boy took the task as if the future depended on it, and in that second it did, and the world’s nastiness stood off to the side and grumbled. Troy banged his shin on a low table and swore at furniture in a tone the furniture ignored. They ate noodle bowls standing up and steam made their faces holy.

By the time the wind dragged the last of the tantrum across the sound, the work had become cleanup. He crawled into a crawl that smelled like a whisper of sewage and performed the particular liturgy of bleach and fans and apology. He nailed up one of Maggie’s screens over a vent where the wood told the story of something with teeth, and the act felt like both defense and invitation. He realized, in one of those private observations he would never say out loud because you sound like a fool until your hair goes white, that he had stopped looking for enemies and started assuming there would be neighbors. The pill bug on the beam was a neighbor. The fat spider in the far corner was a neighbor. He didn’t have to approve of everyone in his census tract.

He and Iris stood in the pump station catwalk two days later, both wearing hard hats that made them look like they were auditioning for competence. Janice had given them a tour that was mostly rules and good-natured threats and then left them to their gear with the cautionary glance of a woman who knew what music people did to machines. Iris set contact mics with a deliberateness that made him love, and he recorded the stepping-on of pumps, the relays like metal eyelids, the sudden onto-ness of the big line. It was louder than he had guessed and more precise. The room sang in D, Iris said, and he couldn’t argue. He found himself grinning at the idea that a thing designed to prevent catastrophe had a key signature. He held the harmonica to the metal railing and let the pump’s vibration make a note without his breath, and the resulting tone was thin and perfect and not his at all. “See?” Iris said, not triumphantly but with the pleasure of someone being proven right by a friend. “Walls. Singing.” They went for pho after and slurped without embarrassment, both smelling faintly of chlorine and machine. He almost said their father’s name and didn’t. She almost did and didn’t. They clinked chopsticks instead because sometimes that is what families get right.

Char had taken to keeping a small vase of rosemary on the bar because she claimed it kept the air slightly less committed to other people’s perfume. She squeezed a sprig and made the room smell like memory and told him she was signing up for a bass class because learning in public felt like a good way to remind humiliation who was boss. He said he was going to go back under a house with Iris in a day or two, to let her listen to the bones of it, and Char said she would not come because she had promised herself to never be horizontal in a room that wasn’t a bedroom again, but she wanted to know if he came out with a song. He said he would bring her a sound like rain agreeing with wood and she said she would put it behind a whiskey and see if it deepened the taste.

Under the house with Iris was like under any house and unlike any he’d ever been under. She had a headlamp and the kind of delighted fear that makes smart people reckless, and he kept her between beam and beam like a shepherd who knew the terrain and the gullies. She taped a small piezo disk to a joist and another to the duct and plucked like a giant’s harp, eyes huge in the unrealistic light. He felt his body do its old calculation about the number of legs within a foot of his face and then felt the calculation become a background program that didn’t need to throw an error. He spoke to the air the way he had learned to speak to himself, which meant he said quietly: “Good. Okay. That’s all. We’re just borrowing time and space. Excuse us.” When a house centipede blurred into existence, an impossible insect calligraphed by anxiety and function, Iris froze. He could feel her decide between shriek and study the way you can feel an animal decide which way to run. He put two fingers on the beam as if to say: the ground, here. “He’s all instrument,” he whispered. “More antenna than appetite.” She breathed like he’d taught her, which was hilarious because when had that happened, and then she moved the mic an inch and the duct hummed in response as if pleased at being included.

The union sent him a packet with an application because Marta had decided to do it without asking again. He took it home and set it on the table and didn’t open it for three days because papers suggested permanence while the van suggested options, and he was not a man who trusted permanences that came in envelopes. When he did open it, the language was the language of solidity and benefits, and he found himself making a list in two columns like a schoolboy. Health insurance had its own gravity. So did not having to track every gasket and washer’s tax meaning alone. He looked at his hands and saw his father’s knuckles again and the scar through the eyebrow, which was not in his hands and therefore a kind of relief, and he signed the page that said he wanted to be held to a certain measure by a group that would also bring him potato salad in a foil pan when he got pneumonia.

Troy hurt his back in a way that was more argument than injury. He twisted wrong getting out from behind a sink that had been built by a man with an enemy, and he did the male version of pretending he was fine until Maggie told him he was not fine and also a cliché. In the kitchen of the rental where it had happened, he let himself be told to sit and then sat on a child’s stool because it was the only chair nearby and the sight of him perched on it like a flamingo with regret almost undid Nate with laughter he would have been ashamed of. Instead he put his hands on Troy’s shoulder blades and did nothing useful for the back while doing the entire world of usefulness for the man’s embarrassment by saying nothing stupid. “You want an ice pack or whiskey?” he asked, then added, “This is not a trick question.” Troy chose both, and in that moment he was no one’s bully.

On a night when he wasn’t needed and the town decided to be damp but not dramatic, he took the train up and watched Iris perform the pump station piece in a gallery so white it made all the adjectives in the room feel insufficient. Larkin played with her, a note sustained until it became fabric, and the recordings of the pumps and pipes threaded through like a stern aunt. People listened with attention, which always surprised him because he assumed attentive people lived somewhere else. After, a woman with glasses like serious windows asked if he were the plumber and he said he was at least that, and she told him the sound had made her feel like the building she had grown up in had been talking to her all along. “It’s possible,” he said, and he meant it in the non-metaphor way, and she nodded with a look like someone had given her permission to believe in something without the usual paperwork.

He let the harmonica ride his pocket heavier than it was and played one note in his van before going inside his apartment each night, a ritual that seemed both too small and exactly correct. He practiced the bend Larkin had demonstrated and made the note bruise and heal inside the same breath. He learned that you could pull a tone like taffy and it would not punish you for taking liberties if you were respectful of where it wanted to live. He carried the peppermint vial Skye had given him and touched it to the brim of his hat before going under, not every time, but on days when the air under a house felt like memory and argument. He put the vial back in his pocket after and felt ridiculous and good. He fixed ten little leaks and two complicated ones and a boiler that hated itself and a garden hose that did not care what he thought because it would crack no matter how sweet he spoke to it.

December leaned into the edges of the days, making them small and tidy, and the town hung its strands of lights with varying degrees of grace. He went to The Mule on a Tuesday for the open mic because Char had dared him in a tone that did not sound like a dare and brought the harmonica in his pocket like a confession. People read poems that sounded like the inside of their ribs and sang drivers’ ed songs from heartbreak, and he did not put his name on the list until two beers had made him either braver or more stubborn. When he finally stood up, he described himself only as a man who worked under houses and then held one note as steady as he could for as long as he could, and Char, behind the bar, laughed like a person watching a friend climb a fence in a dress. He bent the note the smallest degree and people who had not noticed that harmonicas could do that looked up from their phones and then went back because life asked too many things all the time to be interrupted by a note, and he did not blame them. He sat down before the note had the chance to become an argument. “Nice,” Char said later, sliding him water without asking, and when he said he should probably leave before anyone asked him to do it again she said, “You could also do it again and it would still be a good idea.”

On a Friday morning, he met Skye at a small house where something had chewed the foundation vent into a suggestion and he nailed up one of Maggie’s screens while Skye checked the eaves with a glance that had more information in it than any manual. “You ever think about leaving?” she asked, meaning the city, meaning the work, meaning the parts of yourself that had become furniture. He told her no and yes, and then told her a truth he had not packed for and did not know he would say until he heard his mouth: “I like being useful where I know the names,” and she nodded like that was a compass. She said she would be taking a week in January to go where no one knew her to see if she liked the look of herself without other people’s sentences on her, and he wished her the absence of emergency and the presence of large sky.

Christmas made the city act like a person trying out sincerity. He drove past a block that had agreed on a color scheme and smiled in spite of himself at the agreement. He did three quick jobs on Christmas Eve morning for people who apologized for existing and took cookies in exchange because that was the law, and when he went home he put the box on the counter and watched condensation bead on the plastic lid. He considered the grave again and considered not going. He didn’t. He poured coffee and didn’t pour any out. He sat on his bed with the sound of carts rattling on wet pavement and played a small note into his hands and made it longer than the last time. He thought of the ladder scar and the way his father had called all hardware male or female according to its most stubborn parts’ mood, and he thought of Iris walking backward under a house holding a microphone up like a candle. He fell asleep before the note left the room.

New Year’s came with a fog that swallowed sound and made even fireworks feel like someone else’s bad decision happening in a different town. He took the train for no reason except to sit and watch the city he lived in be something he loved and something he barely tolerated, both in equal measures. He wrote his name on the union application with the same pen he used for invoices and did not mail it yet because the act of leaving it on the table felt halfway enough. He found that the fear had become as scheduled as the mail, arriving roughly daily with the bills and the envelopes full of charitable pleas, and he got better at placing it in the stack without assuming it meant doom. When he went under a house and felt the web pull across his mouth and the world’s hair stand up, he sometimes laughed at the E-flat squeak he made and made it again on purpose to feel like the mood had become at least partly his.

He did a big repipe in January for a couple who could not stop thanking him for existing, their house a Craftsman that had been used and loved and misclicked at least twenty times by different hands. He replaced every run that had learned to lie, every elbow that had become an anecdote, and when he opened the new line and the sound came up through the walls like a good idea he allowed himself the enormous luxury of liking the job not just for the end of it but for the middle. He put the old lengths of pipe in the van with an affection that would have made him blush if anyone had been around to see it. He kept one small section of threaded galvanized at the shop and used it as a paperweight on forms that asked him to name and date and categorize his life, a joke he told himself that kept him from swearing in public.

When he took down his hat in a crawl and saw a cluster of crane flies battering themselves against a cheap window that someone had framed up under a porch, he reached and gently gathered one in his hands, ridiculous in gloves, and coaxed it toward the slot of air. It was not a noble act. It was the smallest of gestures in the direction of being the man he wanted to be, and the crane fly did not thank him and the world did not change its weather. The rung was still covered in legs in his imagination sometimes. The rung was still a rung. He put his elbows where they belonged and inched forward and the pipe sang in some key he was learning to recognize by feel. The city kept smelling like what it had always smelled like and then, some mornings, like a thing he was just about to name when a dog barked or a truck downshifted and stole the word. He let it go. He would get other words. He had Skye’s vial and Iris’s files and Char’s rosemary and Larkin’s cheeks and Maggie’s screens and Troy’s strange kindness on the child’s stool. He had Marta’s calendar where his name was a block and a responsibility. He had the harmonica in his pocket, not a promise so much as a tool for remembering how to hold air without feeling like it would leave him to look for someone more impressive. He went under the next house and counted the nails like prayer beads and thought about the way the wind had combed the tide flats and left them exactly as they were and not at all the same.Chapter 7

By February the city’s breath had traded one spice for another. The boiled pennies were still there under the tongue of morning, but something mossy had crept in, a low green that lived in the seams of sidewalks and told you the rain had been working even when you weren’t. Nate woke to that smell like he’d woken to a strange house and needed to orient. He could name the months by the air now, the way a person names chords by ear after a while, and on the last Monday before March the air said, almost kindly, get up.

He got up. The day had the ordinary shape of two swaps and a crawl and a call he knew would turn out to be a loose set screw that had somehow incited a family argument. He ate toast over the sink because toast is less a meal than a permission to leave the house, and the spider at the window had taken its web down in tatters as if it had disagreed with the light. The harmonica lay next to the disassembled toaster that he had not assembled because it was good to have a small thing broken and deliberate, something to fix when the rest of fixing felt theoretical. He put the harmonica in his pocket, checked for the peppermint, and went out to the van.

Marta had left three tickets on the bench with the morning’s version of her handwriting, which grew more slanted the closer she was to throwing the stapler. “Broadway swap, South T terrace, Hilltop crawl. Be a prince,” she’d scrawled. He made a face at the word and she shrugged from the desk without looking up and said, “The fairy-tale kind, not the messy real kind.” Troy shuffled in late with a scarf that said nothing of fashion and everything of a neck that had learned about weather the hard way. He nodded at Nate and didn’t say the nickname, which had persisted like a stain for months and then softened into a memory without date or cause. Small mercies had to be taken at full value. Maggie had a thermos the size of a toddler and a patience that looked like swagger until you needed it.

The first swap went easy. The garage was spacious in the way of houses that had convinced themselves the car was not important and then changed their minds. The old tank had a bottom rust line that looked like it had been marking its height like a child against the doorjamb, and Nate patted it once, ridiculous, before disconnecting. The homeowner was the kind who followed you without being in the way, telling the story of the house like it needed to be rehearsed for a future audience. “Bought it for thirty-eight in eighty-two,” he said with awe as if reciting a prayer, and Nate wanted to bless him with tales of washers and clean thread. Instead he worked. The press tool made the good, specific click that every plumber in two counties could pick out of a party, and the line held and the new tank built its heat like a philosophy. He left the manual on the dryer and made his handwriting neat on the invoice because the house seemed like the kind that would file him under H.

On South Tacoma, a woman with a voice that had learned to talk louder than televisions greeted him with gratitude that made him suspect a real problem had disguised itself as a small one. The problem was small, in fact—an aerator clogged with the stubborn sand of a hundred days of construction—and the fix was two minutes with a toothbrush and a quiet lecture to the line. She stood with her hands on her hips and watched the flow go from sulk to plank and said, “You’re a sorcerer,” and he said, “Toothbrush,” and they both looked at the toothbrush like it had worked overtime for the cause. Her nephew, a boy with a haircut that said someone else’s idea, came down the hall with a bug book clasped like a Bible, and his aunt said, “He wants to be an entomologist,” and Nate said, “We need them,” and meant it without irony. The boy opened the book to a page of wasps so beautifully drawn that for a second Nate’s chest forgot how not to jump. The drawings were precise in the way of old science, the latin names in a font that looked hand-cut. “This one’s European paper wasp,” the boy said, poking at the P. dominula like it owed him money. “They’re invasive,” he added, which made the word sound like a failing grade and didn’t not fit.

Hilltop’s crawl was a rectangle under a rectangle, a little extra room that a house gives the future without telling anyone. The access hatch had warped into a shape that made even the best intention cuss; he levered it up with the heel of his hand and his new habit of not resenting the wood for being itself. The air under was damp and polite and smelled faintly of cat and time. He put his hat on, palm to brim for the peppermint, and slid in. The ground was mud like cake batter at the center and dust like talc toward the edges, and he made his elbows patient across both. The first web hit his cheek and he let his mouth stay closed around the vowel. The second draped his ear and made the world go briefly cotton, and he counted nails by twos like he’d learned to when he got tired of ones.

Halfway in, the beam of his light found a community of sow bugs unscrolling in the beam like punctuation marks taking a walk. A pill bug unhinged itself from round and stumped over the two-by like a stubborn song. He nodded at it, ridiculous, and moved on. It took him three minutes to find the leak, which was almost not a leak at all but a sweat, the smallest halo under a joint the last guy had tightened with hope instead of torque. He tightened with torque. He meant the metaphor and didn’t. Behind him, in the wall above, a radio played a station that could not decide if it was talk or music. He let the murmur be company and thought about how once he’d imagined company as a single person leaning in and listening, and now it was an entire town’s worth of noise that he’d learned to count as kindness.

Iris called at lunch to say the residency had come through in the tentative way of arts grant emails, which used a lot of words to say yes. She was already three steps ahead, planning a map with lines like a transit diagram except the trains were frequencies. “We’ll do the pump station again, but also laundromats, the aquarium filtration if they’ll let us near the seals, the tidal pump by the marina, the university boilers,” she said, then stopped, breathless. “And a creek culvert if we can find one that isn’t only rats and rain.” He pictured a poster with lines in colors no subway ever used—marine green, rust, fog—and he wanted his name on the smallest corner of it, not for bragging, but so that in some future a stranger would see the line labeled Broadway Trap Door, E-flat and smile at the idea of a woman and a plumber listening into a building. He promised to send emails to anyone who owned a door.

Skye texted in the afternoon: “First queens out. South slope, blackberry bramble. Want to watch a monarchy set up shop and break it up before it becomes itself?” He considered the pile of tickets and the way his wrist still remembered the night hornet with a tenderness that surprised him. He wrote back, “After four. I’ll bring the wrong gloves,” which he knew would get him a lecture and then a better pair from her truck.

The call that interrupted the plan came from Marta at three, a message with no charm and no patience. “Main on 19th blew,” she said. “City’s crew is crying for plumbers like it’s prom, and we’re the date they got. Grab hoses and a pump. Maggie’s on her way. Don’t be heroic; be efficient.” He turned the van like a man who knew the holes in the street by name and watched as the sky above 19th took on that peculiar brightness that is not light but atomized water. By the time he parked, the street had made a river and the river had decided to turn right at the corner with the church. City workers in high-vis shouted good ideas that the water ignored; neighbors stood at their porches holding their phones up like offerings to a weather god with a social media account.

The house that mattered first was the low one with the sunken basement where old albums and a velvet couch were trying hard to remember their dignity. Maggie arrived with the big pump and a grin that said, boy, do we get to work. “You take the inside, I’ll charm the outside,” she said, and he waded into a room that turned his steps invisible and thought, not for the first time, that his job was less about pipes than about calming rooms down. The water had climbed a stair and was practicing the second step. He found the shut-off by memory of layouts and logic and shut it off, which was less dramatic than movies would have it and more satisfying, the kind of satisfaction you don’t get to show because everyone else is looking at the surface. He dragged the pump, a beast resigned to its burden, up the stairs and into the worst part of the wet and opened the line, and the hose tried to dance out of its shape and he talked to it like it was a child stealing a cupcake.

He smelled electricity in the wrong place before he saw it—the animal burn smell of live wire in a wet room. “Stop,” he said in a tone that was not the tone he used on himself and not one he used on anyone else much, and the homeowner who had been angling a lamp toward the water like a helpful invention froze. “Out,” Nate added, point, gesture, no panic in the voice. The man backed up the stairs, whoa-ing, and Nate found the power panel by deduction and turned the main like he meant to. The quiet that followed had more in it than the sound had. He stood still for two long breaths, the kind you take to see if the room is going to stay your friend, then went back down and moved boxes by the corners with careful speed. He let the water claim one thing for every two he saved because that was the math the day demanded. He made piles with names—keep, maybe, sorry—and did not explain the categories to anyone, least of all himself.

Outside, the street had decided to run to the alley instead, and Maggie laughed like a referee who had taken up improv. Troy appeared out of the weather with his scarf trying to strangle him and took the hose from her like a dance partner who had been taught by grandmothers. City crew ran a barricade along the gutter with a grace that looked like rehearsal. An old woman across the way brought out paper cups of coffee that had seen hard times and offered them to anyone who’d used their back that day; she handed one to Nate as if she knew him, which, in the broad sense, was true. He swallowed scald and gratitude. The air smelled like a hairdryer directed at a puddle. A child watched from a porch with knees in a blanket and clutched a stuffed animal whose fur had made terrible mistakes in the rain. Nate waved and felt stupid and waved again.

By the time the city got the shutoff closed at the source and the river turned into a conspiracy of rivulets, the day had used up all its exclamation points. The basement was a glossy gray that would become a matte as the hours went, and he left fans like soldiers and told the homeowner what to watch for and what to say to insurance in the tone you use when you give someone permission to be mad. Maggie swatted his arm and pointed her chin toward a roach, of course there had to be one, making a decision on a cinder block near the stairs. They both watched it the way you watch a plot twist you can’t stop and then went on. He didn’t even reach for the peppermint. He kept his breath in the palace of his chest and made it small and regular so that nothing in his mouth invited panic to tea.

He was late to Skye’s field school, but the queens had not minded. They hung in the blackberry tangle like a fantasy of royalty, two fat-bodied creatures with their faces dipped in a welt of fiber they had chewed from the canes. Skye crouched, hands gesturing in a way that would have read as witch to anyone who wanted it to. “Year starts here,” she said quietly, as if the bushes had a sense of honesty. “If you interrupt this part, you make summer different.” He leaned closer against his own advice and looked at the beginning of a comb, the honeycomb invention translated into paper, geometry born out of spit and wood. A slug had left a glistening sentence on a nearby leaf that meant nothing to him and everything to itself. Skye used a trick he hadn’t seen—a little bead of peppermint oil on the cane and a feather move with a brush—and the queens, insulted at the alteration of their very small world, picked up their very big bodies and moved on like barons in a carriage. “You can reroute before you have to kill,” she said, looking at him without the dare in her face. He understood that something in him had responded to the idea that moving the danger was a skill that sat near his real one.

They sat afterward on the bumper of her truck sharing a sandwich that had more mustard than bread and talked about nothing important and everything important because that’s what you do after you’ve resisted the urge to swat. She asked about Iris and the pump station and laughed when he told her about the pipe that sang without his breath. He asked if she’d ever kept a hive herself, just to keep the muscle warm, and she shook her head. “I don’t know if I want a relationship with a queen,” she said. “I like the democracies of small animals better. Ant politics. Cooperative. Ruthless. Honest about it.” He thought of Maggie’s screens and the headlamp in Iris’s hands under the joist and the way Troy had sat on a child’s stool with his pride folded under him and realized he had built a government out of this small town of people without admitting that’s what he was doing.

The next morning the city had returned to the performance of normal. The asphalt wore the pattern of bright cones and the trucks had wandered away to a different hole. He took a call in a new build that had never met a spider and thought of how a clean joist smells like possibility and plain wood. The developer wanted speed and invisibility; he wanted right angles and decent access; they compromised, as they always did, on the half that would carry the next person’s oath. He took a small private pleasure in leaving a clean escutcheon where no one’s eye would go except his, which would pass there years later and feel recognized.

In the afternoon, he walked with Iris through a power plant’s bowels while a supervisor watched them like librarians watching a teenager with a pocketknife. The room was full of disciplined humming, and Iris kept saying, “Listen to that E flirting with B,” and the supervisor said, “Are those the rates?” and they said no and he became less suspicious. They taped contacts to beams and pipes and big bellies of tanks, and he held the ladder like he had held the trap door and felt useful in that way you feel when your job is to make sure someone else can be foolish safely. There were spiders, of course, because there are spiders in temples and in power plants and in thrones, and he did not erase them with mind or boot. He made note of every time his shoulders tried to become his ears and denied them the promotion.

Char came to the pump piece rehearsal and stood at the back with her arms folded in a way that meant she was feeling vulnerable and didn’t want anyone to see it. After, she touched the piezo mics with one finger like they were animals and told Iris she had no idea that water sounded like a zipper being pulled slowly. Iris said all water is a zipper if you think about the fact that two surfaces are meeting and saying no and then suggesting a yes. Char laughed out loud and left with rosemary in her pocket that she swore made train stations more tolerable. Nate watched the two women talk and felt the particular relief that comes when your worlds stop avoiding each other and start telling jokes.

The union packet sat on his table like a polite question. He signed the pages and delayed mailing them with a lethargy that was half superstition and half habit. When he finally brought it to the post office, the clerk weighed it as if it might be a ham and said, “Big plans,” without looking up. He said, “Big intentions,” and put the envelope into the mouth of the blue box like he was feeding it a treat. He walked away and waited to feel different. He didn’t. Two blocks later, he noticed that his shoulders had remembered their rightful zip code and took that as the sign instead.

A call from the old theater came with the same voice—Mrs. Page, crisp and plaintive. The children’s matinee had survived, but the women’s chorus needed a rehearsal in a room that had decided to grow a new leak in honor of the spring of voices. He went, because he liked buildings that knew how to work and complain. The trap door had been named with a marker in looping script—N. Hollis Portal, do not drop—and he grinned at the future apology it contained. He found the new leak by the honest method of putting his ear to the wall and listening for the false note. When the line stopped crying, the women’s chorus filed in with coats that all used the same color vocabulary and mouths that remembered their vowels. He kept his hat on and sat in the back and let them warm up, the hum filling all the cartoons of the painted sky. Something in his chest answered the note before he knew it had, and he pressed the harmonica to his mouth as if it were one more body in the glory of the chord and let a single thread out into the air, careful not to tangle anyone. A woman three rows up turned and put her finger to her lips in a way that was less reprimand than invitation. He dropped the harmonica to his lap and mouthed, sorry, and meant, thank you.

His apartment felt different by inches. The carts still rattled and the bass still thumped on weekends like a neighbor practicing mortality, but the window had a new web in the angle this morning and it made him weirdly relieved to think the spider had made it back to a good corner. He had started to leave a corner of the window uncleaned on purpose, which was an odd state to arrive at and one he wasn’t sure he would explain to anyone. The harmonica’s faceplates had taken on a patina that was part mouth, part city grime, and it made the notes feel less borrowed. He picked it up before bed like a toothbrush and he let his breath make a sound that reminded him of the pumps, and he bent the tone until it prayed and then laughed.

Late in March, a call from a little museum on Pacific asked him to look at a leak in the ceiling of a room full of artifacts that had never expected to see water again. He climbed an ancient ladder into a crawl that wasn’t under but over, the dusty attic a country with its own laws, and he talked to the joists the way someone talks to a horse they secretly want to love. The leak was an old copper run that had tired of being looped over a beam and had decided to cut a shortcut in its brass heart. He fixed it and then paused, perched between rafters, and listened to the building rehearse the creaks of winter into spring. A white moth went insane against the glass of a ventilation pane and he cupped it gently, more out of practice than mercy, and sent it toward the slat where air forgot to be shy. He thought of the museum below, the jars of buttons and the maps with the wrong names for things, and he decided he would come back and look at the glass cases like you look at a mirror before a job.

On a Friday that was not his, the shop held a meeting because someone in a blazer needed them to hear about a new schedule that made no one exactly happy and no one exactly furious. They sat in folding chairs swallowing stale coffee and listening to phrases like spread the load with the patience of people who could fix what needed fixing regardless of a chart. Marta rolled her pen between her fingers and caught his eye and made the small face that meant, This nonsense too shall pass. Troy leaned too far back and pretended not to catch himself in time. Maggie asked a question that took the polite flesh off the plan and left a thick bone. In the parking lot after, Nate stood with them in that triangle of co-conspirators and thought of the envelope in the mailbox on its way to a room somewhere that would decide if he belonged to more than a van and a schedule. He thought of potato salad and winter jobs and pensions and the room where people would argue about whether charcoal or gas makes a better burger. He thought, to his own mild horror, that he was ready to go to their barbecues.

Spring flipped the city over like a mattress. The moss got bold and the cherry trees did their absurdity, walking around town in their flip of the season like teenagers in pink coats. Iris texted pictures of petals on cars, captions with too many exclamation points, then apologized for sincerity and sent a recording of a storm drain swallowing spring. He sent her a recording of a hose bib waking up after winter, the sputter that sounded like a fisherman clearing his throat. She told him it was an A that wanted to be a G but had too much air, and he told her she made up the rules and she said that was half true and all good.

The day he chose to go back to Lacy Mae’s street, even though he had no call there, was a day that smelled like pennies, seaweed, and the rumor of smoke, as usual. He parked where he had parked and walked past the narrow blue house, looking for nothing and not finding it. The chewed corner of the crawlspace door had been fixed with a piece of fresh wood and a square of screen that he recognized as one of Maggie’s, and he touched the edge of it like you touch a good sentence. A new child’s toy lay in the yard, a plastic thing with wheels and the promise of making a racket, and he felt a small surge of relief that the world allowed for the noise of toddlers and plumbers in the same block.

When his phone rang, it was Skye, not for a nest but for coffee. She said she wanted to talk about leaving and staying and whether a week in the desert would make her love the rain more or less. They met at a place that believed in pouring hearts in foam even when no one had asked for that level of intimacy. She wore a jacket that did not believe in rain, which he admired as a thought experiment. She said she was thinking of a place where there were fewer queens and more sand, just to see. He said he was thinking of a paper that would make him a person in a room with rules, and she said that room would make him more of what he was and less of what he pretended. They sat, adults with thermoses and plans that had the decency to look like guesses, and promised to send each other pictures of alarming bugs and unalarming landscapes.

When it rained again, the rain took its time and told the town secrets in long sentences against windows. He took three calls that were almost jokes—my dishwasher hates me, my shower won’t choose a temperature like a politician, my washer does a dance and tries to leave—and he did the competent, unshowy work of telling machines how to live with families. At the last house, the woman thanked him with half a bag of oranges that had remembered the sun all winter, and he put them on the passenger seat of the van where they glowed like polite planets.

He slept better by degrees. He woke once with the feeling of web on his mouth and he whispered the sentence he had practiced without kidding himself: “Not for me, not for you, we’re both just crossing.” He felt foolish and fell back asleep before he could criticize himself into waking. In the morning, he went under a house and the webs were where webs are and his heart did the arithmetic of panic and then lost interest. He put his elbows where the timber asked and his breath where Larkin had put it in his cheeks and he listened to the pipe, which was how he had always wanted to be talked to.

The city’s rails sang under the train. He bought tickets for no reason and a few with cause. He let himself be carried. He looked out at the waterway, which had never tried to be Paris a day in its life, and he loved it for refusing, and for being a place where gulls argued like philosophers and people poured coffee like sacraments. He went north and south and came home each time with the same library of smells on his clothes, and when he sat on the edge of the bed he played one note into the room and counted to see how long he could hold it without pain. He increased the count by one every night that he could. On the nights he couldn’t, he called the failure practice and had the decency to believe himself.

When the first true warm day arrived and the city took off its jacket and then put it back on three times in an hour, he was under a house with Iris again, this time with Larkin, who had agreed that ducts were clarinets if you buttered up the room correctly. They taped and plucked and hummed and recorded the room’s discontent and delight. A spider scuttled past intermissions, a long-legged creature with no interest in the human half of the world, and Iris leaned her head against a beam for a second, not in defeat, but in prayer. He touched the top of the beam with two fingers because there are gestures that make no sense and fix nothing and are exactly right. Larkin, face streaked with dust in a pattern that looked like a music staff, blew a soft run that made the foil duct stutter and purr. In the corner, a silverfish wrote the letter of its species and promptly forgot grammar. He let it, and he did his work, and when they backed out into the light he came out last to cover the hatch and remind the day it was accountable to him if only for that moment, and the air outside reminded him it was not accountable to anyone and he laughed, which made Iris, half-blind with dust, laugh too, and they stood there on their knees, under a house and over the earth, laughing at the fact of being alive in a place with so many unreasonable rooms that still hummed when asked.Chapter 9

By June the city had traded its wool smell for hot tar and raspberries. The rails sang when the sun hit them long enough; the alleys put up the perfume of blackberry vines bruised by children learning the geography of shortcuts; the waterway lifted a breath of kelp that had opinions. Nate woke into that heat the way you wake into a language you almost speak. The spider at his window had gone thin, its web a minimalist’s manifesto in the corner, and the harmonica on the sill stayed warm to the touch even before he had made a note. He played one, not to test himself but because it had become a way to greet the room without making the room do all the work, and then he drank the first half of the first coffee leaning over the sink in case the day needed him before he had time to swallow like a gentleman.

The union letter arrived like it didn’t want to be a big deal. The envelope was white in the polite way; the logo in the corner had been designed by someone who loved bold lines. He tore it with his thumb as he crossed the parking lot behind the shop, the heat coming up through the blacktop like memory, and read it standing next to the compressor cage while it whined its private hymn. Journeyman status recognized, benefits commencing pending signatures in a room with bad coffee, training for apprentices on Tuesdays, meetings on Wednesdays wherein attendance would be requested and snacks supplied. He felt the clause about snacks like a hand on his shoulder; he had suspected that belonging would taste like potato salad, and now it would. He carried the letter inside and put it on Marta’s desk, and she looked at him over it with the particular softness of a person who had already decided to be proud of him before he had decided to deserve it.

“Wednesday,” she said, tapping the line as if the paper were shy. “Leave your loner act in the van. Bring a pen that works.”

“My pens all work,” he said, then immediately thought of three that didn’t. She smirked, then looked past him to Troy, who could be counted on to produce a joke when sincerity began to spook.

Troy, to his credit, didn’t throw one. He translated the moment into something he could stand. “They got a raffle for a drill sometimes,” he said. “Once I saw them give away a ham. It was a good ham. You had to be there to know.”

“I’ll go for the ham,” Nate said, and they both knew he was going for the room.

The union hall smelled like dust with a hobby. The banners from parades on 6th Avenue hung along the walls like saints who had learned the word OSHA; a collage of old faces watched from a corkboard where the staples had built a second city under the first; the chairs were the heavy folding kind that punished bad posture. The men and women in the room had the look of people whose work left marks you could trust. They shook his hand with a grip that could unscrew a stubborn cap. The president had a gavel that would have made his father scoff and love it. They ran through the minutes with comic speed and real interest in the one agenda item that meant more showers were going to be corrected instead of guessed at. Someone made a motion to buy a new coffee maker. Someone else offered a used one, then was mocked with love until he rescinded. When they called his name, a dozen voices said it at once, and the sound braided into something like a chord. He said the words they asked him to say about safety and solidarity and the fact that you don’t leave anyone under a house alone if you can help it. After, in the parking lot, a man old enough to remember torque wrenches with a paternal grief told him stories about a boilermaker strike that had somehow ended with a water fight and scarred knuckles. Nate thought of his father and let the story attach itself to his own grief without arguing.

Iris’s residency did not begin; it revealed itself, the way fog reveals a ship one shape at a time. There were emails with phrases like deliverables and access and liability waivers that made his teeth itch; there were social posts with a photo of a piezo microphone taped to a pipe in a way that made the pipe look like a cyborg; there were rehearsals whenever a room would let them be alone long enough to convince it to speak. He stood in back rooms with Iris and Larkin and observed the way strangers arranged themselves around sound: the posture of skepticism with arms crossed tightly; the posture of being moved with the chin dropping toward the chest; the posture of curiosity, which was a bent head and a hand that kept time in a pocket. When they performed the piece for the first time in a decommissioned substation in a neighborhood that used to be a we, the walls made a noise like trains under rivers and someone cried with their hands on their mouth, and he did not feel embarrassed for them. He held the harmonica in his pocket and played one breath into it during the part where Larkin made the room forget to breathe, the note so quiet it folded into the bigger note and ceased to be his alone. After, as people stood around pretending not to be buzzed on frequency, Char appeared at his elbow with rosemary in her hair and a grin sharp enough to slice bread.

“Had no idea the city could do that,” she said, and then, in the voice she used when she wanted to be kind without sounding like she was, added, “You look like someone set down a weight and forgot to pick it back up.”

He wanted to say yes and that he hoped they forgot it longer. Instead he asked her when her bass class was going to unleash itself on the public, and she said he’d better show up for open mic next month or she would march to his apartment and learn the harmonica by force.

The heat made the city soft around the edges. Roof tar got forgiving; fences warped and made new shapes for dogs to put their noses through; people used spray bottles like sacraments. The calls shifted with the season: hose bibs coming back to life and behaving like toddlers after naps; sprinkler systems designed by optimists weeping into basements built by pessimists; bathrooms refusing to be a refuge because the toilet had decided to teach a lesson about parts you never saw until they failed. Nate took a call at a baseball field where the drinking fountain had broken itself into a geyser, and he shut the line and got it quiet while a team of ten-year-olds in red watched with the solemnity of jurors again. One of them said, “Are you going to fix the water forever?” and he said, “For today,” and the kid seemed satisfied at the idea that days were what you could promise and not forever.

Skye left for the desert with a text that was half myth and half shopping list. “If I see a tarantula I will send you his portrait and his consent. Don’t let my clients burn their garages down in my absence. The peppermint is your church,” she wrote, and sent a picture of the back of her truck with a sleeping bag and a shovel and a stack of books about animals that did not recognize desert as an insult. He was surprised that her leaving made him feel as if the town had lost a small stabilizing rivet. He did two screens in a single day like a man doing penance for a future emergency.

The emergency arrived at a school playground on a Monday one tick this side of noon, brought by a cluster of paper wasps who had decided the hollow under the eave of the portables was an address. Kids had been sent inside because a teacher got stung twice and didn’t have her tough face ready. The vice principal spoke with the unsteadiness of a woman accustomed to actual responsibility and unaccustomed to bugs that acted like policy. Skye had left Nate’s number on a list because he’d asked for it and because she was a prophet of what she had learned you could delegate. He stood under the eave with a hat and the goggles he had started to carry and felt the old panic raise its head like a dog that still lived in the yard but had been trained to sit. He breathed where he had learned to breathe. He smelled peppermint before he remembered he had put it on the brim. He explained to the vice principal what would happen as if he were describing a faucet aerator, making plain that he would not be an idiot and that he did not have an EpiPen and that if anyone in the building did he would like to meet that pen now like a colleague. She ran and came back with a nurse who had been waiting for someone to ask her to be a hero.

The nest glowed in the gloom like ugly lantern, a perfect oval hung by its pedicel. The wasps wrote their commas angrily across the air. He held the sprayer Skye had left him—the soap mix and the mister with the ridiculous laser of a logo—and talked to the hole as if it were going to answer. The first mist landed and changed the quality of the light. Wings became something that could not hold a decision. The wasps came down like furred seeds with rancor. A few hit his gloves and wrote their small punches. One landed on the back of his hand where the glove stopped because summer had convinced him there were limits to precaution and he felt the sting like an old piano’s key hitting a string that had never been tuned. It was pain, not prophecy. He swallowed the salesman at the door and kept the mist level, kept the bag ready, kept the tone in his voice law-abiding. The nurse stood near, not hovering, holding the pen like a promise that no one had to cash.

When it was done, he put the nest in the bag and sealed it with the duct tape that had learned to be everything in his life except justice. He brushed the sleeve of his shirt where a wasp crawled exhausted and not yet at peace. The vice principal thanked him four times in four different Englishes, one of which had been learned just this year. A boy with a serious face pressed his hand to the bag as if to feel the heartbeat of something that no longer had one, and his mother tugged his wrist gently away without making it a scene. Nate held up the bag and made the mistake of trying to lighten the air with a joke about showing-and-telling the anatomy of regret. It went nowhere with the crowd. He lowered the bag and said, “I’ll take this away now,” and that was the right level of prose.

He sat in the van afterward and waited for his body to tell him the rest of the story. His arm was red in a very fair way; his chest did not disobey; his breath stayed with him. He hummed the smallest note into the harmonica without lifting it from his lap because the heat would make his mouth stick, and he thought, with a practical gratitude that felt cleaner than the old need for glory: this could have gone other ways and didn’t. He texted Skye a picture of the bag and a shot of his wrist with the welt mapped in red, and her reply came from a place with sky so large the pixels seemed amused. “Look at you, monarchy manger. Soap never fails. Also: you’re not dead, which is always a good data point,” she wrote, followed by a picture of a lizard that seemed to be smirking.

Later that week, the show moved to the old theater because Mrs. Page had decided the walls needed to learn new songs. The chorus women warmed up in the lobby while the piezos were taped to pipes backstage like benign leeches. A man from the city with a badge and a nostalgic mustache stood in the aisle and listened in a posture that said he did not understand but was willing to be hypnotized. Troy showed up in a shirt that had been ironed by someone who cared about him and stood at the back with Maggie and did not make any jokes that would need to be dismantled later. Marta sat with her bag under her chair, shoulder raised like one of her calendars was vibrationally aware. Char leaned against the bar in the lobby and offered rosemary to anyone whose face read like panic. When the room began, it began softly. The pumps and pipes brought their frequencies like dishes to a potluck; the snare brushed the walls and they answered in their painted sky voice; Larkin made the long note that was a bridge and a dare. Iris spoke the sentences that did not require apologizing afterward: this is your city; this is the part you never hear; this is what keeps you safe; this is the orchestra you don’t pay for and use daily. The recording from the pump station came in and made a huge sound like a whale arguing procedure. People ignored their phones in public, which is the most sincere compliment a room can be paid.

After, standing under the fake clouds, someone asked him what a water hammer actually was, and he explained with his hands and then with one of the recordings on his phone, and the person nodded slowly like a dog listening to a complicated command. He watched Iris be loved by strangers and felt a joy that had nothing in it that needed to be proven. When he passed Mrs. Page, she squeezed his elbow and said, “I named another trap door for you,” as if she had had a litter of them.

In the quieter corridor of summer, he was assigned a wiry person who insisted on being nothing but an apprentice, and it turned out to be a woman whose name was Amaya and whose questions came clean and true. She was twenty-two, which meant she had not yet decided whether the rest of the world was incompetent, and she took to the habit of looking up roofline-to-foundation with a reverence that made him want to be careful about what he taught her. He showed her the trick of listening to pipe with a screwdriver because stethoscopes make men blush; he told her the rule about labeling a shut-off like you want the next person to forgive you; he told her about elbows as metaphors and then apologized for turning into a man who spoke in metaphors while under houses. She told him about her grandmother’s sink and how it had the taste of tin and a dash of meteorite, and he told her that was just Tacoma, but the meteorite was new and he would listen for it. Under a duplex in Oakland, he let her lead and she hit her shoulder on a joist hard enough to bite a curse, and he said the tone he had learned from talking to himself and she glared and then, to his relief, laughed with her mouth closed to keep the dust out.

Char took her bass to open mic and invited his harmonica to have the smallest of dances. He did not say no, which counted as brave. They played a version of a song that did not entirely exist, which was the only way to do it, and she kept time like she had always had a sense of rhythm, and he bent a note until it flirted with the evening. A man at the back shouted “blues” because that is what men shout when presented with a sound they can name, and they nodded to appease him and then made a sound he would not be able to put a word on. After, on the sidewalk, Char looked at the harmonica like it had just revealed itself and said, “You’ve been practicing,” and he said, “Every time I have to talk to myself under a house,” which she accepted as an answer worthy of the genre.

On a Sunday he took a call for a woman who owned a salon and whose shampoo bowl had become a bowl of apology. The drain had given up, and hair colored the trap in the hues of a good mood. He cleared it with efficient tenderness and thought of the pile of sacrificed strands as a nest of its own, a paper wasp’s cousin made of vanity and afternoons. The woman kept thanking him with a language that sounded like beauty school and grief, and in the mirror tilted toward the light he saw his father’s face for a second and did not have to look away. The scar through the eyebrow that lived in his memory did not visit; the sound of laughter from the back when someone made a mess did.

He went with Iris to record a culvert, which is a sentence that would have made him laugh in another life. They found a concrete mouth where a creek became dark for a length and put microphones along its lip while a crow sat above them and offered editorial notes. A group of kids on bikes stopped and watched with suspicion that turned into interest when the water’s tone rolled out of a small speaker and made the world seem logical. One kid said it sounded like the sound in movies when a spaceship arrives very slowly, and Iris told him that is exactly the note, even if the spaceship doesn’t show. A man walking a dog who wanted to be a horse told them the culvert had once flooded so badly that the street had resembled something biblical. They recorded his voice for the piece and he cried in a polite way that would not require explanations to anyone who might round the corner.

The days without incident had become the secret goal. He did not need scaling joy to know he was moving. He liked a day in which a water heater did what it said it would after the second try and a garden hose threaded right the first time. He liked a day where the household he entered did not require the story of his father to make a valve close. He liked a day where the harmonica stayed in his pocket and the peppermint stayed on its shelf and the biggest drama was a screw that refused to find its home until he remembered to tell it he knew its name. He liked, he discovered, teaching Amaya to name things without turning knowledge into a tight fist. On a Thursday, they shared a lunch on a curb and she told him a story about her cousin’s quinceañera where the sound system had failed mid-vow and the room had sung the missing music correctly, without permission. He told her that was what good walls do, and she offered him a bite of a pastry that tasted like sweet furniture.

When the first true heatwave pressed the town flat, calls multiplied like flies. Basements grew sullen and strange, pipes expanded and then acted like they had been insulted by physics, and people turned short. Marta ran the desk with her hair up like a flag; she dispatched with a general’s calm and a nurse’s triage. He went under a house so low he had to exhale to fit and found himself pressed between old insulation and a ground that had forgotten cool. He felt the old call of panic cough at him and he coughed back. He counted nails, counted numbers higher than he needed to, counted the screws on the underside of an old dining room where the family above argued about popsicles in a language he almost captured. He hummed E-flat on purpose and almost laughed when his squeak matched it. He found the leak and patched it without ceremony. He backed out and lay on the grass for a second longer than he would have allowed himself last year and watched a dragonfly draw a map over his face in zigzags that felt like permission.

The wrench above the glove box had become the kind of companion you forgive for bad habits. The magnet still failed to do its job with any integrity, and the clank at each light had turned into a metronome matching the way the city was starting and stopping without him needing to overinterpret it. He bought epoxy at a hardware store run by a man who insisted on first names, unscrewed the panel, looked at the place where he could make it silent, and then screwed the panel back on without fixing it because some noises are the way you know where you are. When he took the train north later that week, he recognized the moment when the rails under the bridge hit the note that meant he would see downtown soon, and he played it under his breath into his hand and let it go.

He did not call the grave as often. He did not forget it. He found himself saying his father’s name in the cab once in a while and not needing to say it twice. He took a call in a bar where the men had all decided to be nice because the owner had learned how to be not afraid of asking them to be, and he fixed the ice machine with a patience he had thought reserved for elderly relatives. He walked out into light that had decided to be gold for an hour and thought, not for the first time, that he had accidentally built a life that made sense on more days than not.

When Skye came back from the desert she brought him a jar with a shed skin folded inside like parchment, some lizard’s polite goodbye. She said the sky had been rude in its size and that she liked rain more than she had even before. She had learned the names of three new ants and had not fallen in love with a queen. They sat on his tailgate in the cooling evening and watched a pair of teenagers practice skating in a lot that had always wanted to be a stage, and Skye asked him, easy as asking for salt, if he’d thought of taking the test for the inspector job that would open in the fall. He said he liked crawling and she said inspectors crawl too, but with clipboards, and he told her he wasn’t ready to carry righteousness with a badge. She nodded and said it had been impolite of her to assume he wanted to tell other people what to do. They split a sandwich that had celery in it in a way that made him feel simultaneously rich and six, and he thought about how decisions changed their shapes when you looked at them in different weather.

At the end of the month, the shop closed an hour early and Marta ushered them all into the parking lot with popsicles like a kindergarten teacher who had conquered irony. She announced, with a flourish that fooled no one, that the schedule would be less stupid next quarter, that she loved and despised them in equal measure, and that there would be a barbecue on Saturday at the union hall where they would all harass each other into playing horseshoes. “If anyone brings a salad with raisins,” she added, “you will be mocked respectfully.” Troy raised his hand and asked if maybe this time they could have a spicy category for deviled eggs, and Maggie carefully handed him a flyer featuring a large cartoon pig. Nate took the flyer and the popsicle and stood in the light thinking of the letter he had mailed and the room full of people who had clapped for his name as if he were a meeting agenda item and a body at the same time. He thought: I am moving without running and that will have to be enough.

On a night that tried hard to be a rehearsal for fall, he went under the narrow blue house on 6th the way you go past an old school where you hated one class and loved the rest. The vent screen he’d put up was holding; the wood he’d suggested be replaced had been replaced; the smell was damp and honest but not sour. He crawled to the place where the elbow had once grinned at him and touched the new fitting like you touch a scar that no longer hurts. A web draped his face politely and he closed his eyes against it without making the old sound. He counted the nails he had once counted the day everything went wrong and stopped when he realized he did not need the number to do the job. He backed out and stood in the yard where ferns were already fattening toward a winter that would arrive and arrive again. He put his hand on the chewed corner with the fresh wood and felt ridiculous and blessed. He walked to the van and started it and let the wrench clank on the dash like a friend, and when the penny-and-seaweed-and-smoke smell flowed in he breathed it like a note and decided to call it C for now, even if Iris would argue it into G with affection. He drove toward a life that did not require heroics and forgave him on the days he tried anyway.Chapter 10

The summer’s heat finally grew bored with its own performance and then, as if jealous of a rival’s entrance, the smoke came. It arrived not in drama but as a slow argument that made every alley taste like a campfire you hadn’t consented to. The boiled pennies were still there under the tongue of morning, but they were carrying a new metallic companion, a cousin that had slept in burnt fir and decided it liked the house. The first day of it you could pretend it was an anomaly; by the third, people started talking about air in terms they used for soup. On his walk to the van, Nate pressed the heel of his hand to the window and left a clear print on the film of fine ash, and for an indulgent half second he imagined someone finding it in a hundred years and concluding that the people had tried to push the outside back in.

Work learned the new rules faster than most. Marta propped the shop door with a box fan that made the place hum in a note that lived somewhere between headache and relief, and on her lunch break she texted him a link with a subject line that said: We can make this, you saint. It was a sketch of a filter box from duct tape and furnace filters, an invention named after people he did not know in a state he had never been to, and he stood in the plumbing aisle with a cart that had opinions and bought four filters with his own card because even if the shop would reimburse him later his body wanted the act of reaching for them to feel immediate. He built one on the tailgate with Amaya holding the tape while Maggie heckled the geometry and Troy admitted he wanted one without admitting he wanted one. When they plugged it in, the fan threw itself into usefulness, and the new hum settled in E, Iris would have said, or maybe D that was pretending, and they stood around it the way people stand around campfires, open-mouthed and a little reverent. He made two more in the afternoon on jobs that would allow it—one in the daycare that smelled of finger paint and bleach and now smoke, one at The Mule where Char kissed his cheek with a straight face and put the box behind the bar like a weird new patron and then declared the room sounded calmer. He recorded the chord of three fans playing a stubborn long note together and sent it to Iris with a caption: “Tacoma lungs with a cold.” She sent back a heart and three exclamation points, then apologized for the punctuation and told him to keep the boxes away from curious toddlers and men who think they can improve fans with elbow grease.

He tried a mask in the crawl and discovered that the combination of smoke air and insulation dust inside paper made his sense of himself shrink and expand in the wrong places; he took the thing off and wore it around his neck and tried not to immediately feel improved like a politician who’d found a headline. Under houses, the world smelled less of fire because the ground had its own stored weather, and he felt briefly grateful to dirt for being literal. Above, the town did the polite version of panic: people limited errands, apologized for their windows, discussed air purifiers as if they were celebrity chefs, and posted photos of sunsets that made the world look like a tolerant end of days. He stood in yards with customers whose eyes were damp for reasons beyond the usual and listened to their exhalations about the mountain disappearing, about whether birds were okay, about a garden that had finally been okay and then fell behind on breathing. He kept his answers practical because he had learned that if you solve a single thing in front of someone during a day like that it arranges their brain differently toward hope, and he could do that even if he couldn’t clear the sky.

The call about bees arrived the way calls about electrical panels and missing cats sometimes do, through the back door of the day. A woman whose voice wore the precise clip of someone who had had several meetings already stood at the base of a wall and pointed up with both the authority of a conductor and the alarm of someone who had smelled sugar in a place sugar did not belong. “It’s honey,” she said, which he had not expected, and when he put his palm to the painted plaster it came away with a faint tack that had nothing to do with paint. He looked under the eave and saw bees moving in a seam where the soffit had learned to welcome strangers, and he felt the old part of his body lift its head like a dog at a door and then, more quickly than he would have given himself credit for last year, felt the trained part tell it to sit. The heat had encouraged the honey to wander, and a stain the color of a late afternoon began to map itself in the corner above the dining room built-in. The woman said the word termites by way of trying out all possible horrors, and he told her no with a confidence that surprised him by being correct.

Skye was at the refinery of her desert when he called, likely learning the sociology of lizards, so he reached a beekeeper whose number lived in her list, a man named DeShawn who spoke of queens like they were nieces. The man arrived with a portable calm and a veil he put on last so nobody would suspect the veil of being the hero. He knocked on the wall with his knuckles like a doctor knocking on a patient, then set out tools that were cousins to the ones in Nate’s van: a knife a little too thin, a brush so soft it could baptize, a box that was more idea than box, smelling faintly of old wax. “We’ll do it nice,” he said, which sounded like a promise and a philosophy. Together, by different routes, they made a plan: de-energize the part of the wall with the least damage and the best story, cut a clean square, and coax the living into the box before taking the sweetness away to keep each from making a case against the other’s survival.

They opened the wall as if they were revealing a fresco that had been painted over out of embarrassment, and the comb came into sight in sheets, a graph paper of life and intentions, a city that had decided to exist in the place where drywall had told the family history in nail heads. The bees moved like commas, yes, and like ends of sentences, the edges busy and the middle a hum. DeShawn made a sound that was both praise and assessment; he teased the comb into the frame as if it were delicate lace and a roast at once. “Nice brood,” he murmured, and it was a sentence that could be said in kitchens and in fields and under eaves. Honey had made its way down the studs as if responding to gravity in a new way, and when a rivulet broke free and spilled it hit the tarp they had put over the oak table with a polite shocking plop. The room began to smell like August and breakfast. The homeowner stood with her hand to her mouth and wept one small surprised sob that seemed to embarrass her, then laughed in the same breath and apologized to no one.

A bee got under the cuff of his glove, because of course one did, and when it realized the corner it had chosen was a person’s skin it told him about it in its sharp bright language. The pain was vivid and clean, fierce without betraying him. He felt his body, like a fair-weather friend, watch to see if it would be asked to do anything dramatic, and he declined the drama with the breath he had learned under a different set of boards. Peppermint waited on his brim if he needed a talisman; he didn’t. He counted the screws on the outlet cover and then counted the hexagons visible in the combs and arrived at no exact number that could help him. The primary queen moved, large and unhurried, and he thought of a small car being navigated through a grateful crowd. DeShawn made a low amused noise and said a word that must have been a queen’s name in his personal language. “C’mon, auntie,” he said, and she listened, which was more than most mornings could claim.

By the time they finished, there was less wall and more light in the corner, the comb boxed, the bees arguing inside the box in a way that meant they’d follow, the lemony wash of a substance like superglue sealing the path so that the old address was shut. Honey had traced an amateur map down the insulation and into their clean containment, enough that ants would send scouts but not enough to insult the floor forever. He cut clean the edges of the opening and promised to return to close the square after the space had had a day to forget it was a story. The homeowner thanked him with an intensity that revealed itself to be the gratitude of someone who had feared being doomed to a word she had learned recently—remediation—and been guided instead to the less dramatic word—repair. He carried his part of the sugar out to the truck where it would not create its own case study in August, and he smelled like a child’s good day when he got in the van and laughed aloud, which felt like a sin he could live with.

Iris came by that night with a stack of scribbles the size of a medium-sized dog and set them on his table without asking if the table had time. Her residency had begun to collect weight—emails from the council, a list of venues that owed her a call, a collection of names of janitors that meant more than those other lists—and she had the aspect of a person who had said yes to a task that had grown more arms. “The map’s getting arrogant,” she said, thrilled to be irritated. “I have to decide how to show people a sound without making it a diagram that looks like a snake eating its own optimism.” He fed her pasta without apology and offered to build the mic stands he insisted would be more elegant if they had compression sleeves and set screws. She rolled her eyes at the word elegant and then drew on a napkin a design called: copper pipe plus stability equals art. He made two the next day on his lunch, stealing lengths from behind the shop with the blessing of Maggie, who said they looked like something from an old movie where plumbers have cheekbones, and delivered them to Iris where she set them up in a way that made him suspicious of the ease of collaboration. “I should have asked you at the start to raid your world for mine,” she said, not apologizing, just noticing.

The union barbecue did what summer gatherings do: made the world look briefly like a good plan. The hall’s parking lot sprouted tables like mushrooms after a rain, and somebody had engineered shade with tarps and rope in ways that would have made the code inspector following them for work weep in secret. There were deviled eggs in variations that would have made a cookbook; there were burgers that split their juice down the sleeve of a man who looked surprised to discover his shirt could do that; there were beans cooked to a theology. A ham did appear as a door prize and was carried off by a woman whose hands looked like they could have built the hall, and applause broke out for her like the town had been waiting for a ham winner all week. He stood with his back to the cinderblock and let the noise in. When they talked shop they did it in the tone of people who knew that the business of the day would still be waiting in the morning; when they talked weather they meant work; when they talked families they meant the parts of themselves they had to agree not to bring to crawlspaces. Troy threw horseshoes with the twitchy bravado of a man committed to pretending he was bad at things until he could be good at them on purpose, and when he finally landed a ringer he refused to let anyone clap because it broke his rhythm. Marta sat on the hood of her car as if cars had been invented to provide thrones for dispatchers, and she heckled the concept of raisins in potato salad in a way that put the matter to rest. Amaya told a story about a line that blew in exactly the second she had believed it would not and how her eyebrows had survived, and the men who had once saved their eyebrows with damp rags nodded in a physics language that did not require verbs. Char brought a cooler full of something that tasted like a cocktail wearing a sun hat, and when she pressed a cup into his hand she said, “Play me a note when you’ve finished being fed by a city,” and he stood next to her truck and held a single tone up to the heat until it felt like the day and not a trick.

Smoke, like a drama queen, left as suddenly as it had arrived and pretended it had never been there; the air went back to tasting like the town’s affordable honesty. Calls roared for a day and then thrummed again. He took Amaya into a crawl so short it should have been illegal and made himself go last so that he could lay the board for her and so that he could practice being a person who told another person everything would be fine and mean it. She hit her shoulder, cursed in the kind of Spanish that made him wish he had grown up with more cousins, and kept going. When a web did the across-the-mouth thing, he saw her jaw clench and he told her, as if he were narrating a recipe, “Two teeth to the left, there’s a nail head you can grip like a rung; then breathe here, not there; and that sound you just made is E-flat,” and she snorted and said, “You are ridiculous,” and the moment passed the way such moments need to, with someone choosing humor over theater.

There were days when the city pretended to be autumn just to keep people guessing. On one of those, they climbed the catwalk of a pedestrian bridge that crossed the tracks because Iris had got permission from a man who wore the sentence “Use Common Sense” like a badge. The rails had their own poem, and the bridge had been built to refuse resurgence of the twenty-year-old impulse to spit; the metal hummed in three notes at once, the foot traffic below improvising polyrhythms with strollers. A yellowjacket—the late-season kind that had become anarchists—found them at the apex and made a figure-eight that felt deliberate. Iris froze, then did the thing that meant she had been listening to him in crawlspaces, which was to breathe in one place and out in another and to flick one hand like a conductor excusing a second violinist politely but firmly. The insect did not respect art but respected the absence of wind, and it went on to look for a picnic. He opened the peppermint and tapped a dot onto the inside of his cap and felt silly and protected, and when he looked at Iris, she made the face she made in church once when she had been a kid and had decided God should see her being careful. Larkin, below, played one note toward them just to see if it would climb, and it did, and the bridge seemed to approve.

The show that had been an email became a rehearsal and then, almost without anyone noticing the line, became a date on a calendar printed in two colors. Union Station said yes because someone with authority had been seduced by the vocabulary of arches, and because Janice had called in a favor on behalf of water, and because the man with the badge had liked the idea of people hearing the city without putting anything on a pedestal that would fall. The dome had always wanted to be a throat, and when they taped contact mics to the metal ribs they fed the room its own voice back, which can be dangerous, but the room took it as a compliment. He built four more copper stands and a small rack for cables without snarls because even beauty tripped if you didn’t watch where you put its feet. During the sound check, a child ran under the largest arch and declared loudly that it sounded like a whale thinking about the DMV; Iris wrote the line down verbatim and used it as a program note.

His part had crept into the production like a mouse through the line of baseboard. It had started as a joke: he would stand in the back and hold one note when Larkin needed a hand bridging two lungs. Then Iris asked him to play not once but through a section where the pumps’ recordings had to travel across the old building, and he wanted to laugh and refuse and did none of those things. He practiced, not to be good, but to be steadier, and the cheeks-breath that had started as a survival mechanism became a technique he could call by its playful academic name in his head. The day of, he brought the harmonica in his pocket like it was a letter he would have to read aloud to strangers, and he kept his hands clean because it felt like an apology if he didn’t.

They began the piece in a hush the city did not deserve and nevertheless gave them. The mics gathered the pumps from a dozen rooms and ran them through wires into an old rotunda that had heard arguments about buses and justice. People came and sat and pretended to have nowhere else to be, which is how art works when it works. He stood in the back with the copper stand aimed toward the rib that had the best hum, and at the buried cue he breathed and held the note he’d been practicing, and it did what it had been doing in his apartment at night, which was to become less about mouth and more about spine, a straight thing he could trust while his head was full of other people’s sentences. Larkin took it in and did that secret sewing she did, and for a moment he could hear all the rooms he had worked in, not literally but the weight of them, laundries and basements and theatres and pump stations and the steam that is promise and the drip that is confession, all of it agreed upon by a building that had been made for trains and now behaved like a heart. A man in a tie at the back took off the tie because he forgot he had agreed to be a man in a tie. Char, with rosemary in her hair, put her hand on her chest as if to remind herself where breath lives. Marta stared as if daring the notes to misbehave and then, when they did not, allowed herself a genuine astonishment that looked like a smile. Troy filmed for a second, then remembered to just be in the room.

Halfway through, because the city will be the city, a wasp arrived from nowhere and scribbled its displeasure across the light above the west door. A row of heads watched it like a plot twist they had all predicted and none had prepared for. He felt the old alarm paw at the floor of his ribs, and then felt the new pattern put a leash on it. Without stopping his note, he tilted his head, breathed where he had learned to breathe, and gave one small hand signal to a volunteer near the door—open and wait. Light shifted; air moved not like a wind, but like an invitation; the wasp chose the outdoors because the outdoors had decided to be easier. Only afterward did he realize that his hands had set the peppermint on the stand’s base without thinking, as if he were a man who had a ritual for luck in a room that had never heard of luck. The woman with the serious glasses who had asked him about water hammer after the substation show stood near, and she lifted her eyebrows in what he had come to know as a private cheer, and he laughed a little inside the note and no one could tell, which was its own small prayer.

When the piece ended, it did not end with the fake loudness of applause in hard rooms; it ended with the thing the room itself did, which was to give back a long soft echo and then be quiet without being empty. People did clap, of course they did, and then they did the other nice human thing of talking to each other as if they had known one another before this, which, maybe, in a building that had cradled labor and travel and the cost of both, they had. He took off his hat and wiped the inside of the brim with his thumb where the peppermint had dried into a thought, and he thanked the sound tech in the way that is part handshake and part apology, then stood aside while Iris absorbed being loved by a room with the careful mouth of someone who had wanted this and also now had the odd desire to hide. Larkin hugged him with her instrument bumping his hip and told him his note had behaved like someone dependable, and he told her her embouchure had been kind to the building, and if the two of them sounded like liars to anyone else, the room disagreed.

Work did not get easier after you made a room sing. It got itself done, one part at a time, which was the draw. The next morning, he unclogged a sink in an apartment where a woman seemed surprised to have a professional stranger say to her without doctrine that she should not pour bacon fat there anymore, and she put her hand to her mouth as if that sentence could save love. He tightened a gas fitting in a restaurant that would have killed someone in December if not for August, and he spoke the sentence you say to new cooks about pilot lights like you are telling them about faith. When he dropped a screw and heard it sing against the bottom plate he didn’t swear immediately; he listened for the key. He taught Amaya the thing about tapping pipe for answers and she made a skeptical face that took him back a decade and a half and then texted him later that afternoon that the trick had worked and that she would never admit it on paper. He wrote back the prayer-hands emoji and then followed it with a picture of a wrench, which read as a joke and also a statement of vocation.

A box arrived addressed to both him and Iris with a return address in capitals and bureaucracy, and inside was a letter that said kind things in a stiff font about a residency complete and a city that felt seen and a check that would be money and not all the money anyone needed. Iris waved it at him like a flag and said she had promised mushrooms as payment and he said he preferred fry bread and she said both was the compromise the art world had been trying to reach for years. She told him Larkin had asked her to come to Portland for a small festival that would pretend to be big and that she would go and come back and it would not be a big leaving, and he said the thing you say to a person whose leaving is small and temporary and still felt like a chord shifting under your feet, which was: yes, go, and bring me the sound of a different city pretending not to be jealous of ours.

That night, the city tried on a breeze that felt like the first day of school, and he sat on the edge of his bed with the harmonica in his hands and played a single note long enough that he could feel the seams in his breath and then he smoothed them the way Larkin had taught. Outside, the carts rattled, and someone’s dog declared its right to exist, and the bass two floors down made a case for its own importance without convincing anyone. The spider at his window had rebuilt in a way that suggested it understood architecture, and he leaned close enough to blow on the web and watch the geometry accept but not break, and he laughed at the fact that his life included the ritual of asking a spider’s permission to stand where he stood. He slept without waking to slap at his face, which he did not take as a sign from heaven or proof of personal growth. He took it as sleep.

In the weeks that tipped summer toward fall, he took the train for no reason twice, and each time the rails sang the note he had started to name as theirs right where he expected, and he played along slick and small in his hand so no one else would have to be included in his ritual. He sat with a sandwich in a park on a lunch hour and watched a boy try to teach a girl to throw a frisbee and fail in a way that made the girl laugh and then succeed in a way that made the boy blush. He fixed one leak that had been three and then found the thing the customer hadn’t known to ask about and tightened it out of habit because you leave a place better than you found it even if there is no line item for that. He took a call in a church basement where the coffee had been the same since 1978 and the group that used the room had pinned up new slogans with old tape, and he thought that might be what being a person was, too.

At the end of a Thursday that felt like a sentence, he walked past the narrow blue house on 6th and didn’t knock not because he didn’t want to see if a child would say “bee bye” again, but because the day had already been full and he wanted the house to stay a memory that behaved itself. The vent screen held, the fresh wood held, the world smelled like the waterway being itself and not generous and he took it all in like a note and decided it was G today, because why not. He got in the van and let the wrench clank the way it always did, and he tapped the dash twice like a drummer telling a band to begin, and he drove into a city that did not know him and knew him fine and had learned to hum back when asked.
