The gulls started before the sun, and the cutlery came after. Forks slipped into their compartments like slim silver fishes. Steam rose from the industrial dishwasher and kissed the peeling lemon paint on the kitchen walls of The Driftwood Café, an old Victorian tearoom tucked just off Eastbourne pier, where the pier planks creaked to their own rhythm and tourists came with their pastel trousers and their bright hopes for scones.

Maisie Linton wiped her hands with a towel that had seen better summers and better tea spills, and hummed beneath the clatter. She always hummed when she was moving, when she was balancing three plates on one arm and there was an order for two bacon sandwiches, one without bacon. There was a space in her head that music knew how to fill, even in the narrow corridor between coffee machine and condensed milk tins.

Her voice, when not muffled by steam and steel, could float, could surprise strangers into glancing up from their tea. Today, at eight-fifteen, she murmured the chorus of a song she pretended had no owner, just to see how the vowels tasted when they left. A little note perched on the rim of her mouth, like a gull on a cement post, and then flew.

“Save the opera for the Sunday lot,” said Mrs. Pike, adjusting her glasses and peering through her own reflection in the pastry display. She kept her hair in a bun that had become an institution. “We’ve barely any scones left as it is. They’ll think there’s some kind of performance and stay for lunch.”

“I’m singing to the jam tarts,” Maisie said. It came out vaguely Northern, the original tracing that years in Sussex hadn’t ironed away. “They’re drooping.”

“They’re raspberry,” said Mrs. Pike, as if that answered anything. “And don’t forget table nine, the lady with the terrible hat. She’ll want a new fork; she always does.”

“Table nine already got a fork,” said Jai, sliding in with a tray like a ship into harbour. He wore an apron with a splash of coffee that had become part of the pattern. He had a manner of talking that kept a beat. “And then she asked for something without gluten or guilt, and I said, ‘We’ve got air.’”

Maisie laughed, and the steam slipped down her throat with her laughter. She reached for a cup, and then the bell above the café door chimed its tinny, real-world version of bells that would, in a few months, seem like a different kind of stage cue.

Outside, the sea did its reliable thing. The promenade carried dogs, joggers, elderly couples carrying memory like a careful parcel. The chalk cliffs sprawled to the west as if a giant had left a slice of cake out in weather. The pier extended its gaudy bones into the water, carrying arcades and teenagers and chipped paint and the occasional wedding photographer like a seagull with a camera.

“Table three needs you,” Jai said. “They’re the ones with questions. From London, obviously. They want to know if we do almond milk that’s been… ethically serenaded.”

“If almond milk doesn’t get at least a lullaby, it curdles,” Maisie said. She gathered the menu, tucked it under her arm, and plastered on the smile that was both natural and armour. The Driftwood taught her that a smile could be both a spoon and a shield.

The couple at table three had matching fleeces and matching anxieties about dairy. The man pointed at the sea as if it had just arrived on the menu. “Is that where the… what do you call it… Beachy Head is?” he asked, one hand on his flat white, the other fluttering. “I read about it on the internet. It looks very high. Are there steps?”

“There are steps, of a sort,” Maisie said, because it was easier to lie about cliffs than to talk about heights and what they mean to some people. “But you want to walk the long way if it’s windy. The wind there has opinions.”

“What about the almond milk?” the woman asked, soft voice, polite. “I mean, if not almond, oat is fine, but not the sort that separates because then I think I’m drinking something… else.”

“We have oat that behaves like a gentleman,” said Maisie. “And coconut that’s not too forward.”

They laughed, and it felt good, like catching a ball you’d thrown and expecting to miss. She walked back towards the machine and set the dials and thought of how she would have said it if she were standing with a microphone under lights that turned everything into a halo. The days when she came back from the bar with two pints and a lemon wedge, she’d picture a panel, bright teeth and complicated hair and the kind of comments that came in millions. “This isn’t just good café banter, Maisie,” someone would say. “You’ve transformed oat milk.” And she’d grin and make something of it, because that was the plan. That was always the plan.

“What are you thinking?” Jai asked, bumping her hip gently. He knew when a cloud had drifted across her face. He knew the forecast.

“Nothing,” she lied. “Everything. A little song I haven’t finished. Or maybe I have.”

“You should finish it,” he said. “You should finish all of them. And you should get out of here before Mrs. P gives you the tea towel award for most plates carried without breathing.”

Mrs. Pike, polished the glass with a cloth that must have been older than Maisie. “The tea towel award is a serious honour,” she said. “Not like them programmes.” She said “programmes” the way other people said “plagues” or “dishes left overnight.”

“Well,” said Maisie, and then an elderly man at table nine tapped his teaspoon with a precise rhythm, as if imitating the second hand of a clock. “We deliver time too, now?” she murmured.

“You,” said Mrs. Pike, not unkindly, “are going to have to install a second pair of legs.”

They danced around each other the way people who share space learn to, moving in a choreography that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with the dimensions of a room. It was a good morning; it would be a long day; it would be a good day because of that.

At eleven, as sun finally decided to test itself against the low cloud, a boy with a skateboard came through the door and almost brought a small terrier with him. The terrier was the kind that looks like it has opinions and has done since the first second it breathed air. Its paws made a clatter on the tiled floor, its lead a whip.

“No dogs,” Mrs. Pike began, on autopilot with a human voice.

“He’s just visiting the scones,” the boy said, hair in his eyes, rolling the board up under one arm. “We’re picking up, not staying.”

The terrier looked at Maisie as if she were a person who had promised something and not delivered.

“I’m visiting the scones too,” she told it. “Don’t make me regret it.”

The dog huffed. The dog had a huff that would be known in other chapters, though no one is granted that kind of foreknowledge and wouldn’t know what to do with it if they were. The boy apologised in a way that wasn’t yet learned, and the dog tugged, and the bell chimed tinny, and the sea kept its own time of breathing and breathing again.

By the time the lunch rush approached, she had served five teas, six coffees, an argument about egg mayonnaise and whose grandmother made it better, and a woman wearing a hat that could have been a small garden. She refilled water jug after water jug and decided she liked the new glasses that made all water look like a thing freshly invented.

She loved the days when she could see the horizon out of the corner of her eye. The days she couldn’t — when the dream clanged inside her like a loose pipe and the reality of carry-and-smile, smile-and-carry, took up that space — at least had the consolation of coins in the tip jar, and the occasional compliment like small cash for the heart. “You’ve a lovely voice,” someone had once said as she sang absently with the radio while scrubbing the coffee nozzle. She’d smiled then and said thank you, because you accept that praise like you accept rain; you don’t let on that rain is the thing that keeps everything alive.

After her shift, the streets smelt faintly of caramelised sugar and cigarettes, and the wind had found its courage. The sea was a particular mood of blue, the sort of blue that postcards don’t dare to print in case people get disappointed. She walked home along the front, shoes in her hand. She liked to feel the cold on the edges of her toes. She liked to think that she walked at the same speed as the water. A seagull made a noise like it had a throat full of stones. Somewhere a child cried, and somewhere a child laughed, and it was the same child, because that’s how a seafront works.

Her flat lived above a charity shop that never closed when you needed it and always did when you wanted a lamp for a tenner and a book someone had written their name in in 1972. The stairs were narrow and the paint peeled in strips like handwriting. Home was two rooms and a window that faced a brick wall beautifully, and it was, miraculously, exactly what she needed most days. She dumped her bag on the sofa and opened the window and let in the salt. She pulled the curtains apart and let in a sky that had changed its mind again.

She had two voicemails from her mother, who had a way of leaving messages like the sea left messages, everything half-said, the most important word washed away. One was about a plumber and how they never came when they said they would. The other was about a television programme involving shepherds that her mother could not stop thinking about. She would phone back later and say, “Plumbers, eh?” and “Shepherds exist in the future as well as the past,” and her mother would laugh and tell her to stop being clever. They’d talk about whether to put peas in a pasta salad, whether to renew the television licence themselves or by magic, and the space where they didn’t talk would be filled with a humming noise that could have been contentment or fear.

There was also a missed call from an unknown number. The voicemail that followed was only half-present, as if the person leaving it was both in a studio and backstage in their own life. “Hi, is that Maisie Linton?” said the voice. It had a bright professionalism that made every greeting sound like an invitation. “This is just an initial check-in call from—” The name blurred under the hiss from her phone speaker. “—if you could give us a ring back at your convenience. Thank you.”

She stood with her thumb on the redial for a moment and then decided to ignore it until she had warmed her hands on a mug. It was the sort of call she pretended could be for anyone, which is to say, the sort of call she hoped was for her, which is to say, something that tasted of adrenaline and had a sugar afterburn. She made tea because tea didn’t demand she be a different person. Tea just said, “Here’s water that’s been changed in a clever way; you can have milk if you like.” She sat on the arm of the sofa and counted the sounds of the street like counting breaths.

Later, when the steam had died in the mug and her fingers were still warm, she called back and walked into the kitchen with the mosaic floor she’d tried to fix with nail varnish. The voice that answered was bright in a bright building.

“Hello, Maisie. I’m Lorna,” said the voice that had once tried to leave a name and dropped it. “Sorry for the mystery. You applied to our programme, back in May. You came to the regional audition in Brighton.”

It was true. Brighton had been different. Brighton had felt like standing on a slightly different version of the planet, one that had tilted her towards the place she thought she was going. She had sung for ninety seconds under lights that turned her face into uppercase. A woman with hair like a plan had smiled at her and said, “You surprised me,” and she had walked out feeling taller and then the feeling had smoothed itself into something else.

“I did,” she said. “It was… I wanted to thank everyone, then, but I didn’t know if that was weird. Felt a bit like bringing flowers to a dentist.”

Lorna laughed. “We like flowers,” she said. “And money and ratings, you know how it is. Listen, is this a good time? I have some news to talk through.”

Maisie sat on the countertop and watched a spider in the corner of the ceiling trying to decide whether to continue its web or go, “You know what, I’ll move.” “It’s a fine time,” she said, heart doing the thing it did when a plane flew low and the cups shook in the café.

“You know the process is long,” Lorna said. “There are lots of people and cameras and, frankly, chaos. But sometimes things happen that change the shape of things. We’ve had a… we’ve had an opening.”

“An opening,” Maisie repeated. She tried the words on like a jacket she thought wouldn’t fit. “Like a window?”

“Like a window,” said Lorna. “Like someone who was supposed to be in the live final cannot be, for reasons outside our control.” Her voice slalomed around the sentences, careful not to name names or reasons. “We have a shortlist of wildcards. People who didn’t make it through in the expected way, but whom the team liked very much. You might be on that list.”

“You might,” Maisie said, because her brain couldn’t wrap itself around would or will. “Are you saying you’re asking me if I could be asked?”

“Maisie,” Lorna said, with a laugh that had warmth under the brightness. “How do you feel about London next week? How do you feel about coming to the studios and letting us put a camera in your face while you sing?”

The kitchen did a small tilt. The window looked at the brick wall like a friend suddenly made interesting. Her heart made shapes. She stood because sitting didn’t feel like a posture that matched the world.

“I feel like—” she started and laughed because the sentence was too big. “I feel like I’ll need to ask Mrs. Pike for the week off. She will tell me the tea towel awards wait for no woman. But yes. Yes. I feel yes.”

“That’s good to hear,” said Lorna. “We’ll confirm everything by email tonight. You’ll have to come in two days early for fittings, a bit of PR, some digital content shoots, you know the drill. We’ll have accommodation for you and a chaperone, and we’ll talk about song choices. Are you… are you comfortable with, you know, the public bit? The eyes?”

“I’ve been practising with the oat milk,” she said, and then blushed because some part of her brain had decided to staple her café life to her future. “I’m okay. I want this. I want this like you wouldn’t believe. But I also—” She swallowed something like crying. “I can do it.”

“Good,” said Lorna. “Believe. Also, tell someone you love who will remind you to sleep. It’s… there’s a lot of noise.”

After she hung up, the kitchen shrank and grew and shrank again, the way rooms do when the thing you’ve been waiting for knocks very politely. She pressed both hands flat to the counter and then picked up her phone and stared at it like it should have become a different object. The light from the window had found a new angle. Her breath had become a thing you could see.

She didn’t call her mother first. She put on her shoes and her coat and tucked her scarf around her like she was defending herself against gales that hadn’t arrived. She walked back out into the late afternoon and the wind knocked her gently into herself. The cloud had moved to let the sun through, and every brick on the street said light, light, I am not dull, put me in a story. She turned right instead of left. She went uphill.

Her great-uncle Len lived in a bungalow painted the colour of an egg in a storybook. The garden was mostly lawn, except for the strip at the back where he had considered growing veg and then decided the council did enough vegetables for everyone. The gate stuck in wet weather and sang in dry. Today it scraped with a sound like a man clearing his throat before speaking.

Len was at the back door making tea, because he was always, in any given moment, at the back door making tea or about to be. He had grown small with time in the way that went unnoticed until someone who had known him long enough said, “When did you shrink? Put you in the wash?”

“Little Lint,” he said when he saw her. He had called her that since the day she’d come home from school with someone else’s glitter on her jumper. “Are you here to tell me you’ve married a prince or that you’ve fallen off the pier and into a boat?”

“Both,” she said. “Uncle, I think I’m going to be on the telly.”

“Finally,” he said. He always said finally when she told him something that stunned her. He had a way of believing things in advance and then going on with making tea. He handed her the mug. “What telly are we talking about? The kind where you bake, or the one where you dance, or the one where people lie to each other in a tropical way.”

“The singing one,” she said. “The one where my voice does the bit and my face has to pose and there are judges who have eyebrows that cost more than my rent.”

“Eyebrows are an industry now,” he said. “I saw them in a supplement. They cost and they have their own opinions.” He gestured to the table. They sat. His kitchen was small and ridiculously clean, a habit of living alone after his wife had passed when you either let the dishes make a nest or you tidied like someone was coming. “Are you ready to be the voice that gets judged by people who’ve never lifted a kettle?”

“I think,” she said. “I think I’ve always been singing into a microphone that nobody could see.”

“Then let somebody see it,” said Len. “Let them see it and do not give away your bones. You keep them. You can lend your skin to the dress-up, but keep the bones.”

She laughed. “You’re full of metaphors for an old postman.”

“I like a parcel,” he said. “I spend half my life thinking about what’s inside the paper and the other half about how to make sure it gets there. This is a parcel. Nobody else gets to say what’s inside. Not even that nice lady on the TV with the hair like a cat fell asleep on her head.”

“You don’t even know who you’re talking about,” she said.

“I know enough about hair,” he said. He took a sip and then breathed like tea was a small holiday. He looked at her, properly looked, which was a thing he did and that was a gift and sometimes felt like the opposite. “You’re shaking,” he said.

“I’m… vibrating,” she said. “Is that allowed? I’m happy. And terrified. Because if I go and I’m… and I do something and I fall over my own tongue—”

“Then we will laugh,” he said. “We who know you will laugh and we will say, there she is, our girl who can balance six plates and a hat and a casual remark and also a song, and she went and fell over her own tongue. And the sea will still go in and out. And you will come here and eat toast.”

“Toast solves everything,” she said.

“Everything worth solving,” he said. “Now, what do you need from me?”

“Advice,” she said. “Or a paper bag to breathe into. Or… maybe just to sit here and have you look at me like I am not about to fly apart.”

“You’re not about to fly apart,” he said. “You are about to expand. They are different. Expansion sounds dramatic, but it just means there’s more of you in the same place.”

She breathed properly then. Having him in the room did something to time. It made it less spiky. It made it lie down in a sunny patch and sigh. She sat with him for an hour, talking nonsense like it was a very important subject, and the thing inside her that wanted to run along the inside of her skin calmed to a jog.

Later, when the sky had lowered itself to a gentler angle and the chill had started to find her wrists, she walked home and called her mother. Her mother did not pick up, because her mother rarely picked up first try; she was a woman who let phones ring out like superstitions and then phoned back at a time when you were in the bath. Maisie left a message. “Hi. It’s me. Just… can you call me? I’ve got news. It’s the kind you laugh at and then cry about and then laugh again. Nothing bad. Okay. I love you. Call back. Or don’t. But do.”

By the time she ate something that had previously been pasta and sauce and was now a memory of both, the email from Lorna had arrived with all the energy of a person in an office whose desk was holding up a small part of the world. It had attachments. It had instructions that were instructions but also prayers that she would obey. It had a cheerful paragraph about what to pack and what not to bring and how hair could be done in twelve minutes if you didn't mind it looking like it had been asked a difficult question. It had a line about “media training,” which made her think of a horse master teaching a radio how to jump a fence.

She lay on her bed and stared at the ceiling, which had a stain in the corner shaped like a country that didn’t exist, and let the idea sit. The idea walked around her room, curious, touching things, trying on her coat, looking out her window. She told it, “I’m ready when you are,” and the idea smiled at her like a child about to run very fast uphill.

The next day at The Driftwood she told Mrs. Pike in the gap between a latte and a layer cake. “I need next week off,” she said, and watched as Mrs. Pike’s bun tightened another quarter of an inch.

“Are you going to your cousin’s thing?” asked Mrs. Pike. “The one with the horse and the meadow and the terrible kebab van?”

“I’m going to London,” Maisie said. She tried to say it in the same tone she’d say, “I’m going to Brighton,” which was to say, casually, like she did it daily. It came out in italics anyway. “To sing. On that programme.” She did not say the name because she was still nervous that saying it might break it.

“We will have to find someone else to insult the scones,” said Mrs. Pike. She put the cloth down. She looked at Maisie like she was both fifteen and thrity. “All right. Go and be famous. But don’t be rude about it. And come back. Because the plates will not carry themselves and Jai will start experimenting with crêpes again if we’re left alone.”

“I’ll come back,” Maisie said, with a conviction that surprised her, because she didn’t know yet what coming back would be like, whether it would be with cameras at her shoulder, or just with the idea that followed her like a breeze long after you’ve shut all the windows.

Jai hugged her like he had known this was in the post and had invited everybody to the surprise party in his head. “I told you,” he murmured. “I told you the universe wants an encore. Bring me a souvenir eyebrow.”

“From whose face,” she said.

“Your choice,” he said. “Ethically sourced.”

Before her shift ended, the boy with the skateboard had returned, minus the dog, as if he had had to separate his life into parts for everyone’s safety. “My gran watches that show,” he told Maisie after ordering a slice of Victoria sponge large enough to be a weight training routine. He told her because she had told him what she was going to do; she had felt so full she had to tell somebody and the boy had been at the counter and she had had a cake knife in her hand and things felt simple when you had a cake knife in your hand. “She says they ruin people on there, but she watches it anyway.”

“They ruin cake,” said Maisie, cutting another piece with the concentration of a surgeon. “But I’m good at cake. I’ll be fine.”

He nodded solemnly like a judge. “You’ve got the face for it,” he said. She waited for him to define it. He didn’t. He just ate his cake with the logic of a teenager: all at once, like an apology he had decided to accept.

By Saturday, the town had begun to notice something different about the way she moved. People don’t always name it, that shimmer, they just ask more questions about the weather as if weather could part its skies and explain. She met Lorna’s requirements like ticking boxes on a sheet — she sent a scan of her passport, she tried on outfits whose seams thought about opinions, she practised songs in her bathroom where the sound bounced back onto her skin and made her feel more material. She told Len about the fittings and he muttered something about “don’t let them put you in feathers unless you intend to fly,” and then “and don’t let them put you in anything that says ‘confidence’ on the tag.”

Two days before she was due in London, she went to the open mic at The Oriole, a pub behind the station that smelt of chip fat and history. She stood in the corner with a pint of ginger beer and felt like a person carrying fireworks under a big coat. She watched the man who always sang Oasis and the woman who did country songs like she had grown up in a field with a horse called Big Trouble. She sang second to last, because that was often the place where the room is either very ready or very tired. She sang a song she had written late on a Tuesday night while her upstairs neighbour had a fight with his kettle. She saw the words float out and sit on people’s shoulders like birds. She didn’t tell them about the telly because it felt like telling someone at the birth of a child how cheap the nappies were at a particular shop. It wasn’t the time.

After, the man who ran the thing — with hair that had chosen a side and then thought again halfway — said, “That was beautiful,” and she said, “Thanks,” and it felt like touching hands.

When she walked home, the air tasted of cold metal, like licking a coin. She found herself thinking more about the rehearsals, about the stage managers with headsets who made the modern world work, about the way the floor of the stage would feel under her shoes. She let herself picture it. She let herself see the camera like an eye that wasn’t unfriendly. She told herself she would not turn into a person who only thought about applause. She told herself that, and the gulls cried like they knew the punchline to a joke she hadn’t heard yet.

On the morning she was due to take the train, she packed a small suitcase with clothes that could be rolled to save space and dreams that couldn’t. She put in the blue dress because it promised to do her shoulders a kindness, and a pair of boots that made her feel taller because sometimes shoes lied in the right way. She packed cereal bars for lines, and tea bags because not all tea is created equal, and the battered notebook with the songs that had left and the ones that hadn’t yet found their door. She texted Len: Leaving soon. Promise to send a picture of my exhibit at the Museum of Overwhelm. He replied with a thumbs-up and a sentence: Do not forget your bones.

Her mother called as she was locking the door. “You’re going to London,” she said, voice all breath like she had run up stairs. “To sing. On the telly. Just like—” She couldn’t say who, because who was a person who had left a long time ago with a guitar and never phoned. “Just like some people do.”

“Some people do,” said Maisie. “I am some people. Are you proud? Or do you need to see my shoes first?”

“I’m proud,” her mother said. “But not because of the telly. I’m proud because you said you would. And you kept a promise to a girl who sang to the spoon drawer.”

Maisie cried, a little, like a kettle does when you don’t give it enough water and it makes noises anyway. She told her mother she loved her. She promised to wave at the camera in a way only she would recognise. She promised to remember to eat. She promised to take pictures of buildings because her mother loved buildings, even the ugly ones, because they told the truth.

At the station, the wind got serious and tried to make everyone reconsider their hairstyle. The train came in belching air and possibility. She climbed aboard with her case bumping the step. She sat by the window and watched Eastbourne slip past like a photograph being pulled slowly away from her eyes. She saw the pier slide sideways and the sea become the kind of blue that hides under things. She watched the backs of houses, their private gardens, their laundry in defiance, their trampoline moons. She saw country slide in, flat and green and then suddenly rising, as if taking a deep breath.

In her lap, her hands lay very still. She watched other people on the train performing versions of themselves they reserved for travel. A man angled his newspaper the way a man does when he wants to be asked about the world. A girl with headphones practised expressions in the reflection, tiny adjustments as if she were ironing her face. A woman ate an apple like it was punching back.

She tried to imagine the studio. She tried to imagine the corridor that would lead to the stage, how it would smell — of metal and hairspray and nerves arranged into flowers — and how her feet would sound on it. She tried to imagine the judge table like an altar and the audience like a weather system. She didn’t let herself reach the part where names rang out and a confetti cannon dreamt of confetti. She kept herself in the corridor. She walked down it in her head, slowly. She reached for the door. She opened it. She—

The train lurched. A baby cried like a trumpet being stepped on. She laughed at herself and took a photo of the sky because it was there.

When she reached London, a woman with a clipboard and a practised grin appeared at the end of the platform like she’d grown there. “Maisie,” she said, in a voice that saw ten moves ahead. “Hi. I’m Saj. I’m taking you to the hotel where you’ll meet the other wild— the other participants. Do you have everything? Any heavy emotional baggage? I can carry it for you but only to the car.”

“I travel light,” said Maisie, and Saj smiled with one corner of her mouth as if that was a good joke she had heard before and liked more every time.

The city opened like a book she had read in school and then again as an adult and found different words. The streets smelled of coffee and secrets. The pavements had their own personality and wanted you to know it. People moved the way schools of fish move when they’re pretending to be individuals. She watched everything. She watched herself watching everything. She let herself be impressed and didn’t apologize for it.

The hotel lobby had carpets designed to discourage people from thinking about stains, and chairs that looked like they had been made for people who were born to sit. There were flowers arranged with such intent that you imagined the person who had arranged them had apologised to each petal. Saj gave her a packet of papers and a badge with her name on it and a schedule that made her stomach both lift and settle. “You’re on at nine tomorrow for wardrobe,” Saj said. “We’ll do a little interview today for social, like, your ‘I’m here!’ moment. Can you say ‘I’m here’ in a way that doesn’t sound like you’re being hunted?”

“I can say it like I’ve just found cake,” said Maisie.

“That’s good,” said Saj. “That’s the vibe.”

In the elevator, there were mirrors on all four sides, and she saw herself multiplied, and she told each version of herself to be brave. When she reached her floor, she met a girl with hair the colour of a peach and earrings that could have moonlight caught in them. “You’re Maisie,” the girl said, and hugged her as if they were already remembering how to miss each other. “I’m Nova. Are you terrified? I’m terrified. I’m also pretending to be a person who is used to this. Look, I have a bag. It looks like a bag a used-to-this person would carry, doesn’t it?”

“It does,” said Maisie. “I’m thinking of buying a hat that says ‘calm’.”

“Make sure it fits,” Nova said. “Some hats lie.”

The room was a room that could have been in any city, with a bed large enough to hold a small country’s problems and three pillows that behaved. She opened the blinds and let the grey of the London sky in. The buildings opposite were rectangles of promise. She tried the bed and found it did that hotel bed thing where it pretends to be your mother while also being firm. She lay back and the ceiling had a soft way of being. She breathed once and then twice and then her phone buzzed with a message from Jai: Bring me a souvenir eyebrow and a story. She wrote back: Eyebrows grow on trees here.

In the afternoon, she sat on a chair in front of a camera and said, “I’m here,” and tried to say it like cake, like sunshine on the pier, like a guitar string finding the note. She did it three times because the first time had too much laugh in it and the second had not enough. She categorised herself: Person with Enough. She made a joke and the cameraman laughed with his mouth closed, and that was a good sound, because it was honest. She was asked a question about what this meant to her, and she thought of Len and his kettle and the look on his face when he held a letter with someone’s name on it a thousand times and then had to put it through the slot. She said: “It means I get to try. It means I get to be the person who tries. I have always wanted to be the person who tries.”

Back in her room, it was half past six and the lights of the city were beginning to argue with the sunset. She thought of eating. She thought of going out and finding a takeaway that tasted like something new. She thought of staying in and ordering a tray that would arrive under a silver dome like in a story where people have staff. She looked at her bank account and decided treat now, worry later. She ordered hotel soup and something they called ‘heritage bread’ like it had been in someone’s family for generations.

When it came, she dipped the bread in the soup and pretended she was a person who always dipped bread in soup in hotels. The sounds of the corridor — a laugh, a wheelie suitcase, a hush of voices that had decided to be conspirators — were weirdly comforting. She set her alarm for too early and put Lorna’s email on the bedside table like a talisman. She texted Len: In the big smoke, not yet smoked. He replied: Good girl. Take a photo of an ugly building and tell your mother it’s handsome.

Before she slept, she stood by the window and watched a fox cross a road like it owned it, tail a flag. She thought about the corridor again, about the stage door, about the camera that wasn’t a camera but an eye. She told herself to bring her bones. She told herself to sing to the oat milk and the jam tarts and the gulls, because that was where the voice came from. She told herself a story about a girl from Eastbourne with plates in her hands and a song in her chest and a tide that kept coming in and going out and in again, no matter who laughed when.

She slept. She dreamed of the pier dressed in fairy lights and a sky that could be held. The next morning she woke with her mouth dry and her heart doing a small tap dance. She put her hair up and her hope on and went downstairs to let the day begin.

In the hallway outside the room where wardrobe lived, there was a dog. A big one with a fur that had decided to be complicated, sitting next to a handler who looked at his watch like it was an enemy. The dog looked at Maisie with calm eyes and yawning calm breath. She reached out, because she was the sort of person who trusted dogs, and the handler said, “He’s not working, you can,” and she scratched behind the dog’s ear and said, “Hi, mate,” and the dog gave her a look that could have been a blessing in a different story, in the story where dogs are oracles and the ending can be guessed early.

Inside, there were rails of clothes in colours that knew how to behave on camera. There were people with tape measures around their necks like medals and pins sticking out of their lips, not dangerously, just stylishly. There were jokes about sequins and vows never to wear flesh-coloured anything. Nova was trying on something that glittered like a fish. “Too much?” she asked.

“Just enough,” said a stylist with white hair that had decided to be cloud.

When they held the blue dress up to Maisie, the room nodded. “This one knows your shoulder,” said a woman whose bracelets made a noise like a quiet tambourine. “If it argues, let it. Arguments are interesting.”

“Fine,” Maisie said. “As long as it doesn’t hold a grudge.”

It was all happening at a speed that at once exhilarated and unsteadied. Photos were taken of her standing still, and then moving, and then laughing, and then being asked to laugh again but less like a tickle and more like a new idea. Someone did her hair with the confidence of a person who had tamed storms. Someone did her face like they were painting a small faithful house with good windows. Someone laced her into something. Someone told her, “Don’t change,” and someone else said, “We’re going to change everything,” and she thought, is this the same sentence or two different wrongs?

In the small break between glam and PR she found her corner and her notebook. She found her pen and a place to write. She wrote: Len says keep bones. Jai says eyebrows. Mum says spoon drawer. She wrote: corridor. She wrote: I am here. She wrote: I am here in a way that only I am. And she drew a gull that looked like a child had drawn it and the child had been in a hurry.

Saj found her there and sat on the floor beside her like the floor was a friend. “Okay?” Saj said. “Too much? Tell me if it’s too much. I can take you to a small room where nothing happens for ten minutes.”

“I’m okay,” said Maisie. “I’m a little… hummed. Like when the fridge sings.”

“I know that hum,” said Saj. “It’s the pre-noise. You’ll be good. Don’t let anyone tell you what you mean. You get to decide that bit.”

When rehearsal came, the stage was everything she had imagined and also something else. The lights were friendly until they weren’t. The floor was black and glossy, like a river that had been trained to stay. The cameras swung with the languid authority of cranes. The studio seats rose in arcs that made you feel like you were at the bottom of a very pleasant bowl. It smelt faintly of steel and makeup and a coffee that had died valiantly for a good cause.

She stood on the mark that had her name in yellow chalk like a schoolyard, and she held the microphone in the way she had practised, with an ease that was both true and invented. She closed her eyes once to see if her voice needed darkness, and then she opened them because the eyes are part of the song. She heard the opening bar in the monitor in her ear and she began. She sang a line and the room listened or didn’t. She sang another. She hit the note she had practised standing on her bathtub, toes gripping porcelain, and it came out like a bird that had been waiting to be let out and knew exactly where the open window was.

“You’re a good one,” said a voice from the dark. It might have been a stage manager or a lighting guy, someone whose job was to make miracles happen and whose compliment was the currency of a very efficient country. She smiled at the dark. She sang again. Her hands knew not to shake. Her mouth knew which name to say. She finished and the room did a small polite clap that felt important because it had come from people who knew the work of making small revolutions happen every day.

After, backstage, where corridors pretended to be endless, she found Nova and a boy called Albie who was nineteen and had a voice like a boat. They had the look of children who had eaten too much sugar. They spoke in a language that was mostly adjectives and hope. They made promises to each other about the future as if the future had ears.

In the tiny gap of her own company, she sat with her phone in her hand, her case open, her shoes making a decision. She thought of Eastbourne and of the Driftwood and of the pier wearing its best, and of Len and his toast, and of her mother watching a building on television. She thought of a terrier with a leader. She thought of a boy with a skateboard and his gran’s complicated love for programmes that ruin people and rescue them. She laughed at nothing in particular.

This was the beginning. This was the middle of the beginning. Some of the story would happen on television and some of it would happen in rooms where nobody was watching. The sea would continue to do sea. Plates would still need carrying. Voices would still need to be whispered into the ears of bad weather. And somewhere, in the space between that humming stage and her hand on a tea mug, a girl would understand something about what it is to want, and what it is to take, and what it is to go on wanting even when the thing you have taken becomes a different animal in your hands.

She went to sleep that night in a hotel bed in a city that had more light than it needed and less kindness than it deserved, and she told herself again, quietly, so as not to wake the girls in the walls and the dreams on the furniture: I am here. I am here. I am here.Morning in the hotel was a different species of morning, as if somebody had drawn it with a ruler. The light seeped around blackout curtains like a polite burglar, the air conditioning continued its polite argument with itself, and the city outside coughed discreetly into its sleeve. Maisie woke as if surfacing from water that had remembered to be warm, her body briefly surprised to find itself in a square of expensive quiet. For a few seconds she lay still and listened to the sort of silence you could only buy by the night, a silence made of elevators that hushed themselves and carpets that forgave shoes. She checked her phone with one eye and found three messages from Jai timestamped too late and too early: a photo of the Driftwood’s new chalkboard special (“Suspicious Quiche — Market Price”), a close-up of a customer’s hat that could have sheltered rabbits, and a voice note that was mostly steam hiss and then, “Break a leg but in the metaphor way, and if they try to make you sing in a cloud of dry ice, tell them you’ve got damp lungs.”

Her reply was a heart and a promise she could not word that early. She sat up and found that her throat had done the hotel thing where it felt as if she’d been speaking in her sleep to a roomful of dignitaries. She drank water straight from the glass bottle because it felt like the kind of day where you could pretend you were in a film about competence. She did the ridiculous vocal warm-ups in the shower, the ones that turned her vowels into bubbles and made her laugh at herself, and the laugh worked better than the scales. When she wrapped herself in the robe, it embraced her like a hug from an aunt who liked a bargain and always knew when your nails needed cutting.

The breakfast room was an international peace treaty of bacon and fruit. People in good trousers made decisions about pastry as if choosing cabinets. A small child negotiated toast with cunning usually reserved for lawyers. Maisie and Nova found a table by a window that framed a slice of building without context and compared plates as though they were comparing courage. Nova had the kind of appetite that went with fear and youth, both generous, and she speared a sausage with relief. “I dreamed I was on stage and my mouth made a noise like a bicycle pump,” she said. “Then I woke up and it turned out to be the air con.”

“Better than dreaming you’re in bed and waking up on stage,” Maisie said, buttering toast carefully, because buttering toast carefully made other things feel possible. “If my mouth makes a bicycle pump noise, I’ll do it in key.”

Nova lowered her voice and leaned in as if the yogurt might overhear. “Do you think they’ll make me tell the ‘my dad left’ story again? They keep asking where the music came from like it arrived on a lorry with a missing taillight.”

“They asked me yesterday if I’d ‘overcome adversity’,” Maisie said. She had rolled the phrase around her mouth afterwards and it had lost consonants until it became a pudding. “I said yes. Once a man ordered a flat white and when I brought it he said he’d meant a cappuccino but with less personality.”

Nova snorted into her tea and then coughed like she had stolen laughter from the wrong pocket. “Saj told me to make a list of what I won’t say. I put ‘my eyebrows are not the story’ and ‘my ex-boyfriend is not a suitable antagonist’.”

“Good,” said Maisie. “Add ‘Eastbourne is not a sleepy town; it naps with intention’.”

They ate and pretended to read the schedule for the day without flinching. Nine, wardrobe adjustments. Ten, a thing called “digital pick-ups” that sounded like a dating app for cameras. Eleven-thirty, vocal with the coach whose picture on the wall showed teeth that belonged to someone who flossed in public. Lunch slotted in like an apology. Two, a block of time called “media” that sat on the page like a black shoe. Four, dress rehearsal. Six, a pause before everything. The day had a shape that accepted you and then pressed you into its corners.

Lorna found them in the lobby wearing a lanyard and an air of being equal to it all. She looked like she had been poured into her morning with neatness. “They’re cutting the backstory VT to two minutes,” she said, as if discussing travel shampoo. “They want to do a line about the café and the sea and how you sing between steam and jam. But we need a phrase from you, something that’s… you know… naïvely poetic but also true.”

“Naïvely poetic,” Nova repeated, rolling the words around like mints. “I can do knowingly mundane.”

“I made friends with oat milk,” Maisie said, because the phrase rose easily to the surface. “It listens.”

Lorna blinked and then smiled, the face of a woman who would write down anything that glinted and take it to the editor like treasure. “We’ll use something like that,” she said. “Not exactly that, because we have a thing with brands and sentient beverages.”

They were whisked along corridors that had learned how to keep secrets by design. The wardrobe room looked different in daylight, less like a dream and more like a busy market where the currency was buckle and seam. The blue dress was there like a promise kept. “We’re doing a tiny tweak,” said the woman with tambourine bracelets, her fingers already coaxing a line of fabric. “The camera liked you but wanted more you at the shoulder. The trick is always you but more.”

“I don’t want to be more forehead,” Maisie said, but she had learned to choose her battles, and shoulders were not the hill on which she would die. As the pins kissed and retreated, she watched herself in a mirror that softened everything like a grandmother. She had never seen herself look this much like a person somebody else might mistake for someone important. It was both thrilling and fraudulent, a twin emotion that set up camp under her sternum and erected a nice little flag.

The vocal room smelled like lemon and ambition. The coach introduced himself as Dan, shook hands with a sincerity that was almost American, and looked at her throat the way a mechanic looks at a carburettor. “You’re holding a bit high in the chest,” he said, tapping a sound out of her with a piano that had national service. “Let the breath drop. Let yourself be heavier in the floor. Sing through your teeth like you mean it but you’re not telling anyone you mean it.”

She did what he said and her voice changed shape under her own ribs, surprising itself. It grew up slightly in front of her, like a child showing you it had learned to tie a knot. Dan nodded once and then again, more slowly. “Good,” he said. “Don’t apologise with your vibrato. It’s very British to apologise with your vibrato. London will forgive you. America will not. You’re not in America.”

She laughed and he smiled in that careful way coaches do when they sprinkle humour between metronomes. Nova went next and built a note so clean it might have been a decision. They clapped each other because that’s what you do when you’ve been given the same mountain and different shoes.

By late morning she had answered the same question about her “journey” four times with four different verbs. She had learned which doors led to rooms that had coffee and which led to rooms that had important people saying the word “brand” like it was an endangered bird. She had nodded carefully at a producer who said, “Can we avoid mentioning your father unless we absolutely need to,” and she had replied, “We absolutely do not need to.” The producer had glanced at her with relief and then tapped a note into a phone as if saving a life.

Back in the hotel corridor, her mother called at last, the call bouncing off the international carpet pattern like a pebble across a pond. “I’ve made sandwiches,” her mother said, triumphant, as though announcing a medical breakthrough. “For the train. Ham and something that looks like cheese but isn’t. I’m on the twelve-oh-six with Maureen because she says she will not watch you alone in the house in case she goes blind with nerves.”

“I didn’t know you were coming,” Maisie said, feeling the floor shift in a lovely way that made you adjust your weight for joy. “I can get you tickets, I think. Saj can do—”

“We don’t need tickets,” her mother said, already three moves ahead on a board Maisie didn’t see. “We’re going to watch at Maureen’s sister’s because she has the big telly and the kind of wine that makes you honest. We tried to get audience places but they said something about lotteries and liability. We’ll shout at the right times. We’ve practised. Also, I found your old recorder in the drawer with the birthday candles. It still has a tune in it. This means something.”

“It means nothing,” Maisie said, delighted. “It means the drawer is haunted. I’ll send you a picture when I’m in the thing. Don’t wear the jumper that is allergic to cameras.”

“It has opinions,” her mother said. “I will silence it with a necklace. I love you. Don’t let them do your hair like that woman on the breakfast show who looks as if she’s been plugged in.”

After lunch (soup that tried to be both comforting and chic and achieved one of those), Saj found her leaning against a wall that probably had a stronger agent than she did. “Two small items,” Saj said, in the calm tone of a person who holds back weather for a living. “One: the head of hair has asked if we can add a hairpiece for the second verse because the lights love movement. Two: social is posting your teaser at three, and there will be comments. Do you want them on your phone or do you want me to take the bullet and send you only the kind ones and the funny ones about shoes?”

“Send me the ones about shoes,” said Maisie. “And one cruel one so I know the world hasn’t ended.”

Saj nodded gravely, as though crudity could be apportioned like salt. “Also,” she added, in a quieter voice that was almost a gift, “if anyone uses the phrase ‘girl-next-door’ in a way that makes your teeth itch, you can send them to me and I will talk to them about doors.”

“Thank you,” Maisie said. “And no hairpiece that moves like animal. If it rustles, it’s out.”

“Agreed,” Saj said, with a little salute that could have been irony or genuine affection. “And Sidenote Len called the office and left a message. He said, ‘Tell the girl that the post is still delivered in the rain.’ I don’t know what it means, but he sounded like a person who meant it.”

“It means I can’t cancel the day just because my socks get wet,” Maisie said, feeling the words settle into place like weights that made her steadier. “And it means he likes to be mysterious on purpose.”

The digital pick-up involved a white wall, a swingy light, and a camera that leaned in like a friend who wants to hear who you’re talking about. “Say your name and where you’re from,” the director said, friendly, patient, a man who had taught many people to walk through a sentence. “Then give us three words that describe you. Try not to say ‘fun’, because fun people never say fun.”

“I’m Maisie Linton,” she said, hearing her own voice and greeting it as if it were a relative who had aged well. “From Eastbourne, which is not a seaside cliché although it does have better clichés than anywhere else. Three words. I am… curious. I am… late sometimes. I am… here.”

“Good,” the director said, the way you say good to a plant that has just surprised you. “Now say something you’d say to your younger self. Not the one from this morning. The one with the recorder in the drawer.”

“I’d say drink water and keep the songs even when they look badly dressed,” she said, and then felt unaccountably like crying, which was unhelpful, so she smiled instead and asked if that had been usable. The cameraman made the mouth laugh again, and that was enough to hold her together.

Dress rehearsal had the texture of reality with all the edges taped. They put her in the dress and the shoes and the little invisibility devices that made the sound disappear into her head and come back like a perfect circle. They gave her a mark on the floor and a cue she could feel in her belly. They asked her to walk as if she had been born on a mark. The lights warmed up like engines. The audience seats were dappled with production assistants, bored and brilliant, clapping in the right places because they had read the map. She ran the song once fully and then again half-hearted because the third time is for people who can afford to get tired early.

On the second run, her in-ear monitor did the thing the universe sometimes does where it whispers, Something will go wrong and that something will be you. The sound cut and she found herself hearing the room instead of herself, a slapback of reality. She stopped where she would rather not stop and lifted her hand slightly in the international sign for, “I am not being a diva but please help me or I will cry.” A figure emerged from the wings with a coil of cable and a headtorch and the ease of a god of small rescues. He adjusted something in a way that had been invented for this precise crisis, and he gave her a nod as if to say, There, the world again. She sang the bar she had missed, and the note curled out obedient and true. Somewhere in the darkness, someone clapped once because they understood the relief contained in a correct return.

By late afternoon the building had clicked into live-show mode. Tempers in far corners rose and fell like soufflés. Trolleys rolled laden with impossible flowers. A coffee went cold upright on a sheet of call times as if it had been mid-sentence. She felt a slow, steady mechanism crank within herself, a sense of gears aligning with the coming hour. She found the little quiet room Saj had promised and sat there, the silence a warm coat. On the wall was a poster from an old series, a girl with perfect hair and teeth arranged like white weather. Someone had scrawled across it, in a hand that was both defiant and grieving: She cried and then she sang better. Maisie looked at it and had a feeling that was not envy and not warning, just a flicker of recognition that people are always two things at once.

Her phone buzzed. It was Len, of course, having remembered the twenty-first-century version of shouting across a road. He sent a photograph of toast. He had arranged it on a plate with the seriousness of a saint. Under it he wrote: Above acceptable standard. You?

She took a picture of her shoes obediently aligned beneath the chair and wrote: Believing my own ankles. He replied: Good ankles run in the family. Also, if a camera tries to steal your soul, keep a copy.

At six, the host breezed into the corridor with the kind of presence that made corridors remember why they exist. He said things to people as if he had invented cheer and was now licensing it. He said to her, “You’re our little café singer, aren’t you,” and she resisted the urge to correct the possessive and simply smiled and said, “I am someone’s little café singer,” because that was true and left him nowhere to stand but where he already was. He waggled his eyebrows at her in a way that suggested they were self-employed and then moved on, trailed by a woman carrying cards and a man wearing the expression of a person who had once been surprised and swore never again.

Saj appeared with a garment bag and a gaze that could focus satellites. “Two minutes for a breath,” she said. “Then we place you. Your song is third. They changed the running order because the second act’s backdrop is allergic to light cues, which is not a thing I knew backdrops could be. If you need to pee, do it now. If you need to cry, do it now. If you need to write a will, it can wait.”

Maisie checked her face in a compact handed to her by a woman who could have sculpted a better face out of meringue and air. She smoothed a thing that didn’t need smoothing. She put her hand to her chest and felt the small metronome of her heart, faithful and unruly. “I am going to sing to the jam tarts,” she told Saj, half under her breath. “Even if the jam tarts are in other houses.”

“Good,” Saj said. “Better ratings.”

They moved as a group, like a dance where the steps were equipment and the music was warnings. She stood in the wings and felt the heat of the place, simultaneous and particular, the way a kitchen has heat you can only describe by being in it. The first act sang and a wall of sound rose and fell, and she allowed herself one peek at the audience without seeing them. The second act stood behind the flat with a look that said, If I run now, I can catch a bus out of town, and then didn’t run, because solidarity is contagious.

Her turn came with the inevitability of a train arriving exactly when it says it will. A floor manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger pointed at her. “Thirty seconds,” he said, the number clean on his hand. “Breathe. Two deep. Remember your first line. Then forget it and mean it.” His headset crackled in a language that only headsets speak, and he listened to the invisible world and nodded as if it had promised to be good. “Ten,” he said. “You’ve got this, love.”

Maisie stepped onto the mark. The lights cooled and then warmed. The set shifted its weight and settled. The mic was a small planet in her hand. Somewhere far away and very close, a camera blinked. She thought of the Driftwood and the lemon paint peeling in long careful strips. She thought of Mrs. Pike and her institutional bun. She thought of Jai and his eyebrows as a souvenir. She thought of Len’s toast and her mother’s sandwich cut diagonally because that did something to fate. She thought of the dog in the hallway and of a boy with a skateboard. She thought of the corridor in her mind that she had walked down a thousand times without seeing the door open.

The music found her in the ear and the floor found her feet and the breath settled the way a bird settles on a wire and trusts the wind. She opened her mouth and let the note out, not like a plea, not like a trick, but like a statement that had been waiting politely to speak. The room shifted slightly towards her. The camera came closer or she went to meet it; in that moment it was impossible to say. She sang the second line and brought her shoulders into it without apology. She remembered, mid-phrase, to open the vowels like windows, the way Dan had shown her, and the sound stepped out onto a balcony and waved.

Halfway through, when the lyric asked her to confess to something she did not owe anyone, she chose instead to tell a simpler truth. It sat inside the line and made it feel different, less like a borrowed dress and more like a jacket she had owned for years. The bridge came and she walked across it without looking down. At the top note, the one she had prised open in her bathroom with steam and stubbornness, the place where women have dropped or soared in front of millions, she did not think of millions. She thought of a little girl singing to a spoon drawer. She thought of oat milk and gulls. The note rose and it did not wobble and it did not apologise. It rang, clean and blue, like a bit of the sea you can hold.

When it was done, there was the sound that is noise and also information. Hands and breath and the small thunder of feet finding a floor they liked. She did not let herself look at the judges because she did not owe her face to their faces. Instead she let her eyes find a place at the back of the room where perhaps there was a person who had chosen to come alone and would be glad of being addressed without being named. She smiled, not because someone would freeze it on a feed and measure it, but because it was a reflex like the tide. She managed not to cry until she was three steps off the mark and safely in a pocket of unlit air that smelt faintly of spray and hairspray and relief.

Backstage hugged her in a way she could use. Nova grabbed her and said things with her whole mouth that did not land as language and did not need to. Albie thumped her back like a brother on a pier avoiding feeling too much. Dan the vocal coach passed and made a small circle with thumb and forefinger, a sign language of competence. Lorna breathed out like a person whose plates had all spun and not fallen. Saj pressed a bottle of water into her hand the way you hand someone a verdict, and the water understood.

The judges spoke in the room out there, the room with the expensive noises. Someone said a word that had too much sugar around it. Someone else said a sentence that took away with one hand and returned it with the other, like a pickpocket doing magic. It would be clipped later and placed on the internet and captioned in fonts she could not control. She listened for a second and then stopped, not ungrateful, just self-preserving. She heard her name pronounced correctly and decided that was a good omen.

Alone for a sliver of time you could slip a coin through, she went to the quiet room and sat on the chair as if sitting were something you could fail. Her phone was a small, lit planet on the table. There were messages from numbers that had fathers attached and from unknowns with hearts in their names. There was a message from her mother that read simply: I see you. There was one from Len with no text, just a video of the sea hitting the Eastbourne beach with its reliable enthusiasm. There was one from Jai: The dog approves. He had attached a photo of a terrier watching a television with an intent so serious it was comic. She laughed properly then, dipped her head and laughed, and let the laugh be the thing that unlocked the rest.

The night reassembled itself around her like furniture after guests. There were more acts and more lights and a segment in which a former champion came back to sing about the high cost of triumph and dental. There were results that trailed their suspense like wedding trains. There was a moment on the stage with a cluster of other people where the host called her name and a camera found her again, and she thought, of course you did, and she stood in the shower of a sound she did not own and nodded and remembered to reassure the people at home that she was indeed still grateful. There was a hand squeeze from Nova that said, We will get through or we will go for chips. There was the strange etiquette around not looking too victorious next to someone who needed a chair.

Later, in the post-something room where questions were asked to fill content like pastry shells, a young man with a microphone that had a foam windscreen the colour of a cartoon asked her, bright as a whistle, “So, what does this mean for the café? Are you moving on?” and she said, without being noble and without being foolish, “It means the café gets more stories to put between the teapots. It means I can carry plates and a song at the same time for as long as that makes sense,” and he blinked and nodded and said, “Love that,” as if he had invented nuance.

Back in her room, alone at last with her face and her feet and her hands that smelt vaguely of roses and microphones, she stood in the window and watched the city keeping its late promises. She took the pins out of her hair one by one, feeling each tiny release as if she were returning parts of herself to herself. She washed the paint from her skin and saw her own colour come back like tide turning on a familiar beach. In the mirror, unvarnished and unscripted, she was a person who had done a thing and would do another, not a legend, not a cautionary tale, and not yet a footnote.

Before bed she wrote a few lines in her book. She wrote: I let the note out and it did not bite me. She wrote: Saj says doors are not people. She wrote: The dog approved. She drew a toast and under it a gull and under that a small rectangle that could be a stage or a table. She closed the book and it clicked shut like a good thought. She crawled under the hotel duvet which had the exact weight of reassurance and she let sleep come, not because she was done, but because morning would be a mouth and she would need to fill it.

When she woke at three, as people do when their bodies have stored messengers, she felt the quiet hum of the building like a ship in friendly weather. She looked at the ceiling and thought of the stain in her flat shaped like a country that didn’t exist. She thought of the pier in fairy lights that had visited her in a past dream. She let herself imagine the next song, the one she hadn’t dared offer, the one that lived in two keys like a house with two front doors. She heard in her head the way the band would find it, the way the cameras would learn to nod. She let the thought be large enough to scare her. Then she rolled over and trusted the dark.

In the morning, she would wake and the city would draw its lines and write her in again where needed. She would answer questions and ignore others. She would drink tea that tried very hard and might succeed. She would text pictures of ugly buildings to her mother and call them handsome. She would look after her bones and let the dresses borrow her, and she would sing to anyone who had once been a spoon drawer. The programme would go on wanting. The sea would go on doing. She would go on being a person who tried. And somewhere, in the Driftwood, a terrier would scratch at the door as if demanding a fork.Morning decided to be obvious about itself. It ironed the clouds flat and sent a band of pale yellow across the buildings with all the ceremony of a first cup of tea. The city coughed properly this time, none of last night’s discreet hand-over-mouth, and somewhere a van reversed with the persistence of a metronome. Maisie woke with her tongue feeling as if it had been speaking foreign the whole night and her shoulders aware of having been loaned to a dress. For a moment she didn’t know which ceiling belonged to her, and then the air-conditioning made its civilised wheeze and the carpet under her bare foot told her she was still inside a place that believed in breakfast buffets and emergency sewing kits in tiny boxes.

Her phone did the thing of being both a door and a crowd. The red dots had multiplied as if they had been breeding when she slept. Saj had sent a packet of links with the label: shoes, only. There were indeed shoes—her shoes, or at least shoes that had been attached to her for the evening—assessed by strangers who spoke in hyperbole and suede. There was a clip of the high note annotated with a hundred musical emojis and three people in Texas arguing about vowel placement. There was a photo of her halfway through a laugh, hair compromising with light, captioned by the show as “Our café songbird,” and she felt the possessive again and let it pass through her like weather. The cruel one Saj had promised was not so cruel as it had intended to be; it said something about “plain,” which made her laugh out loud in the hotel room because if last night had been plain then the world’s adjectives needed retraining.

There were private messages that opened like parcels in a corridor you didn’t know you were walking down. Some were from girls in towns with seafronts and none, with photos of mugs and windows, saying, “I sing to the kettle too,” and “My Nan says you remind her of someone who wasn’t afraid of church.” One was from the boy with the skateboard: Gran cried at the good bit and then pretended she was allergic to light. He had attached a blurry photograph of the terrier with its head tilted, as if listening critically. There was a message from Albie consisting only of a boat emoji and three exclamation marks. There were two from unknown numbers that had managed to fetch themselves into her inbox with the authority of bills; one was a production schedule, the other a request for a photograph of her as a child “with an instrument or a significant prop, perhaps a whisk,” which made her sit on the edge of the bed and hold her ribs and laugh until it became a cough.

By ten she had been shepherded across two floors, into a room that smelt of hair and decisions, and into a chair with a back like a hug. The woman with the tambourine bracelets fluffed and pinned and spoke to her in a language made of compliments that were also instructions. “We’re going to let you be you,” she said, while pressing a hot instrument against Maisie’s head. “But a little more you, for the television. The camera loves a curve and hates a shadow that looks like regret.”

“The camera and I will sign a truce,” Maisie said, and caught her own eyes in the mirror and saw that they had not slept as much as they thought. She put her palm to the glass as if greeting a fish in a tank. The fish smiled back, which was her, which was ridiculous.

Dan the vocal coach appeared like a man who had just tuned a piano with his mind. He made her yawn in specific, useful ways and hum at the walls. “Don’t gargle coffee,” he said. “It’s a lie. Gargle water and swallow courage. Also, breathe into your kidneys.”

“I’ll send them a card,” she said, and he shook his head and smiled and went away to tell someone else not to apologise in their soft palate.

Midway through a bite of toast stolen from a tray going somewhere more important, Saj slid into the spare chair with the authority of a person who could sit in motion. “We’ve had an idea,” she said mildly, the way people say “we’ve had a power cut” or “we’re having a baby,” as if both were inevitable and had asked nicely. “Executive would like to do a return-to-roots package if you progress. Film at the café, a walk on the pier, maybe the chalk cliffs if we can convince Health and Safety that you won’t fling yourself at existence. Mrs. Pike on camera would break the internet in half. We’ll ask consent like decent people. You could be home the day after tomorrow for twenty-four hours. Are you breathing? I need you to breathe.”

“I am,” said Maisie, who had held her breath in the middle of Saj’s sentence as if underwater. “Mrs. Pike will say ‘programmes’ like it’s a diagnosis and threaten the hair and do it anyway. Jai will wallpaper the door with puns. Len will pretend to hide. My mother will insist the house is too small to be filmed and then redecorate by moving a cushion. Yes. Yes, I’ll do it. On two conditions.”

Saj’s eyebrow went up, professional curiosity with good posture. “Name them,” she said.

“Don’t make Eastbourne look like it’s been asleep since 1983,” said Maisie. “And don’t ask me to cry on the pier because the tide has opinions.”

“Deal,” Saj said immediately. “We can’t control the editor’s love of slow-motion gulls, but we can threaten them with a cactus. I’ll call Mrs. Pike and use my best voice.”

They put a hold on a train while the day unfolded like a map. There was a radio interview in a room that smelt of old laughter and sweets, where a man with a beard asked her about “the café life” and whether a cappuccino ever becomes a cappuccino, and she answered with grace and a joke about foam that got her invited back if she had time and liked chairs. There was a photoshoot in front of a backdrop that changed colours like a mood ring where the photographer said, “Give me the woman who has just remembered a better word,” and she found that woman in her jaw. There was a meeting with a producer whose wedding ring and smile both looked expensive, who took deep, meaningful sips of water and wanted to know if she would be comfortable talking about “the paternal absence that shaped your resilience,” and Maisie said, evenly, with the exact amount of you’re-not-fooling-me in her mouth, “No. I am comfortable talking about jam tarts and unpaid electric bills and a man on the promenade who uses his dog for moral support. The rest is bones and I am keeping them.”

The producer paused, recalibrated mid-sip, and smiled as if he had always intended to be decent. “Fair enough,” he said. “Let’s talk jam tarts.” Later, in a lift, Saj patted her arm once, a punctuation mark. “Thank you,” she said. “Not everyone knows the names of their lines. You do. That helps.”

Nova and Albie found her at a table with a salad that looked like it had auditioned for a role in a better salad. Nova had the wide-eyed look of a person who had been crying in a bathroom not because anything had happened but because all of it had. “They asked me if I could sing the one about forgiveness,” she said, stabbing a slice of cucumber as if it had done infrastructure damage. “I said yes and then they said, ‘But can you sing it about forgiveness.’ I don’t know what that means. My mouth is a mouth, not a moral.”

“It means they want you to be a lighthouse and a revenue stream,” Albie said, who had the soft accent of boats and had been raised by older women to carry heavy things without complaint. “Sing your song. They’ll call it forgiveness if it trends.”

Maisie watched Nova’s face make and unmake shapes. She reached across the table and put her hand on hers, a very small bridge. “We can go and buy chips after rehearsal,” she said. “There’s a place the runners whisper about that salts like a religion. We will eat too much of a thing that’s bad for us and talk about nothing in particular as if it’s an art. You can tell me everything you won’t tell that camera with the eyes. Deal?”

Nova nodded, a swallow as decisive as a promise. “Deal,” she said. “Also, your shoes have become content. You’re viral from the ankle down.”

“My ankles have always wanted a social life,” Maisie said, and that got them a laugh each, which was enough to move them all into the next hour.

The train the following day was at an hour that barely qualified as morning unless you were a postman or very committed to bread. Saj had arranged everything with a swish and a spreadsheet. Mrs. Pike had consented in the tone of a monarch allowing a circus into the park, and Jai had replied to a polite email from a junior researcher with, “We keep our jam tarts in their natural environment and may not be able to guarantee their performance; bring treats.” Len had left a message on Maisie’s phone at midnight that just said, “I will be on the path between the brambles and the decision. Don’t be late,” which she took to mean, I will put the kettle on and I expect to be hugged.

The sky over Sussex that morning had committed to pale, the kind that makes birds visible long after they think they’re private. Maisie watched the fields turn into houses and the houses into fields the way people turn into people who have to be somewhere. When she got off at Eastbourne, the platform smelled like its old self: salt and newspaper and the after-breath of coffee. A small camera crew formed a loose constellation around her, careful to make her look like a person walking instead of a person filmed walking. Saj wore a high-visibility jacket that insisted she was a human being with a plan, and a man with a boom pole held his windscreen like a friendly hedgehog. “We’ll keep it small,” Saj murmured. “We are wallpaper. If the wallpaper speaks, it will apologise.”

The Driftwood had made an effort by pretending it had made no effort at all. The lemon paint still peeled in satisfying narratives. The bell still announced arrivals with the humility of an instrument somebody’s uncle had repaired. Mrs. Pike had put on a cardigan with buttons like warnings, and her bun had achieved a height previously reserved for religious buildings. Jai had laid out the cakes in an arrangement that would have pleased an architect, and there was a handwritten sign on the counter that read: We are temporarily famous. Tips help with that.

The first customer on camera was the lady with the terrible hat, which had become more terrible as if it had been breeding with itself. She tapped a teaspoon against a saucer with intent to produce a specific note and said to Maisie in front of the lens, “If you become unbearable, I will still need jam,” which was both threat and benediction. The boy with the skateboard arrived exactly when the assistant director wanted “a bit of normal,” his hair a decision he had made in the dark. He had left the terrier at home, he said, because he didn’t want it “to do a poo on telly,” and then whispered that Gran had made a banner out of a pillowcase that said “Our Girl,” which she would display only when no one was there.

Mrs. Pike refused to say the word “programme.” She said, “television nonsense” and “that business with the lights,” and then finally, after a generous piece to camera about the virtue of a scone left alone to be itself, she said, “our Maisie has a mouth that does good work,” and took off her glasses and polished them in a way that silenced three strong men. Jai did a piece to camera in which he used the word “umami” incorrectly but with such glee that nobody cared. The crew filmed Maisie rinsing cups and singing under her breath, which she swore she didn’t pose for and which she absolutely did. They filmed the pier from three angles and made the gulls look complicit. One gull landed on the railing behind her and performed head movements that were pure critique; the camera loved it. The assistant director whispered, “Can we get the gull’s agent,” and Saj wrote something on her clipboard that probably said no birds in union.

They asked for a walk on the promenade “just towards the horizon and back,” which was the kind of instruction people who do not live by water give. Halfway along, a man who had known Maisie vaguely since she was ten stopped them with the confidence of people who have paid rates in the town all their lives. “Saw you on the telly,” he said, marshalling his eyebrows into formation. “Very good. Your old man will be proud if he’s watching, wherever he is.”

The sentence slid in under her coat and sat there with cold hands. She smiled, automatically, the way she smiled when a customer at the Driftwood asked for something the kitchen didn’t make and used the words “as a favour.” She said, “Thank you,” and meant the kindness and not the hook in it, and walked on with the camera faithfully walking on behind. Past the arcades, past the couple arguing about whether a donut was an experience. Saj drifted back to her like a tide being careful. “You all right,” she said, not a question, which was a gift.

“Fine,” Maisie said, because there were people with batteries attached to them and a schedule and the town had put on its best brave face. “It’s a sentence that will arrive a lot, I think. I may need to learn to nod without bruising.”

“We will hire you a nod,” Saj said, and Maisie laughed, quietly, and let the laugh make a crack where the cold could leave.

They went to see Len because no home story is complete without a man who can boil water into wisdom. He opened his back door the way a magician produces a rabbit, entirely unsurprised, and pulled Maisie into a hug which had spines under its softness. He addressed the camera politely as if it were a council officer and then ignored it completely. “Sit,” he said to Maisie. “Eat this biscuit; it is older than respectable but it will hold together under pressure.” He made tea, and the kettle sang to fill the spaces where none of them wanted to talk. The producer asked him if he was proud and he said, “Yes,” as if the word had been waiting in his mouth, and then, “But I was proud when she learned to cross roads properly and when she put her name on her lunch at school as if it were a declaration. Television is a different kind of proud. It comes in a box.”

The terrier appeared after all, in the third hour, in the arms of the skateboard boy who had been sent home by his gran with orders to stop hovering. It wriggled free like a thought and trotted straight into the café as if on a mission from itself. A jam tart had escaped to the very edge of a plate; it was a tart that had never learned prudence. The dog placed both front paws on the counter with the authority of a small officer and took the tart delicately in its teeth like evidence. The room inhaled as one organism. The camera, being a predator by training, swung and caught the theft in a shot that would later be slowed down and set to a tiny string section. Mrs. Pike said, “Oh, for the love of—” not finishing with a word that would have needed bleeping, and Maisie, out of instinct and kindness, went around the counter to kneel, by which time the terrier had eaten the jam and offered her the even more delicate crust, as though sharing. She took the crust and the room exhaled. The assistant director murmured, “We have our ending,” and even Saj allowed herself a grin that showed a tooth.

By late afternoon they had their pier walk, their café hum, their Linton family offshoot being Linton in a kitchen, their gull, their dog, their hat. They had enough ordinary to make extraordinary look honest. Saj did the thank-yous like a professional bouquet. The crew folded themselves away and promised not to tidy Eastbourne up in the edit, which was the best they could give. Jai pinned a five-pound note to a corkboard and wrote Dog Tax in tidy capital letters. Mrs. Pike declared that she would never again consent to being filmed by people who did not understand the intimate relationship between sponge and custard. Len walked Maisie to the gate and held her for a moment longer than time. “Did the sentence hurt,” he said, in the voice he used for things you might not have words for yet.

“A little,” she said. “Not as much as it will if I keep standing still. And I stood still, Uncle. But it’s—I don’t want to be made out of a hole. I prefer cake.”

“You are not a hole,” he said, with the absolution of the elderly. “You are a road with scenic views and occasional roadworks. The hole is other people’s problem. Also, that dog will be famous by teatime. Beware being upstaged by mammals.”

She laughed and kissed his head and told him she would return him to the television in a fortnight, weather and scheduling permitting. Her mother had elected not to be filmed on account of having a relationship with cameras that could be described as suspicious, but she had sent Maisie off with a Tupperware of sausage rolls and a lecture about sleep that echoed in her bones. On the platform, as the train rolled in and Eastbourne arranged itself back into the shape of her childhood view, she saw the boy with the skateboard and the terrier on the far side, both of them looking as if they had done something significant by accident. She waved, and the boy nodded in that solemn way he had adopted for occasions, and the dog blinked and, without breaking eye contact, licked its nose, which felt like the highest form of acknowledgement.

On the ride back, the countryside performed its smooth vanishing act and the train exhaled at every small station like an old animal. Maisie ate a sausage roll with reverence and read the messages accumulating in clusters. The show account had posted the café clip with the dog and a caption that did not entirely embarrass her. People had found it with the enthusiasm of creatures who know how to find soft things and hold them up to the light. “If she sings like she looks at that dog,” wrote one, which made her grin at the window. There was also a message from a name that looked like it had taken a long time to write. It contained five words: I heard you. Proud anyway. She stared at it until the words went blurry with the reflection of the sky, and then she took a photo of a field because there was nothing else sensible to do. She did not reply. She put the phone face-down like you do with a fork when you’re finished being polite.

Back in the hotel the floors were in a different mood. You learn the personality of a building by how it greets you at different times of day. Tonight it was quietly thrilled, as if it had secrets in the wardrobes. In the corridor Nova was sitting cross-legged outside her room with her back against the door, hair in a knot that looked like it had decided to be contrary. She patted the carpet beside her and Maisie sat, because floors are still floors even when they are expensive. They swapped stories of the day in the way women do when the rest of the world has been speaking in content. Maisie told her about the sentence on the promenade and Nova told her about a reporter who had asked if she was “ready to be a role model,” as if role model were a coat you could try on and then accept out of duty.

“I told him I’m ready to be a person who buys crisps and reheats pasta twice,” Nova said. “He looked like I’d failed a test.”

“You passed the only one that counts,” Maisie said. “Want a sausage roll? It travels well.”

They ate sitting on carpet that was currently a universe. Albie came out of his room in socks and a T-shirt that said “Be Nice or Leave” and sat down without asking because that was the kind of friendship they had built in three days—that of people who pretended they were not making a raft in the middle of a river. He showed them a video of a woman in Blackpool singing his song into a hairbrush and wept with laughter until the housekeeper peeped around the corner to ask if they needed more towels for their emotional support.

Out of habit, when the noise thinned, Maisie reached for the notebook that had been everywhere with her since the day she could afford notebooks that didn’t fall apart at the spine. She flicked to a page where she had written in a train hand: corridor, bones, jam. She thought about next week with the clarity of a person who has run a bath and intends to get into it this time. The producers had sent a list of suggested songs, none of which were wrong, all of which had the shine of a song that had won something for somebody else. She wanted to sing something that did not ask permission. Something that tasted of wind and undercoat paint and clear, sharp mornings. Dan had told her to think about a song with a sliding melody that found her vowels and made them work for it. She thought of one she had sung once in an empty church for the sake of acoustics and stubbornness. It had a chorus that didn’t pretend to be anything it wasn’t. She wrote the title in the margin and underlined it twice. She would have to fight for it. She was more ready for a fight than she had been before the dog and the tart and the sentence.

In the small hours she woke to the sound the city makes when it turns over and goes back to sleep. She lay and listened as if the walls had something to confess. She thought of the message with its five words and put them in her mouth like pebbles. Proud anyway, proud anyway. It was a kind sentence wearing a shirt that didn’t fit. She hadn’t asked for it and she wouldn’t build a house out of it. But she let it sit in the chair for a minute with a blanket around it before she showed it to the door. Then, because there was work to do and cheeks to wash and muscles to coax, she closed her eyes and walked the corridor in her head again. She put her hand to the door and she pushed and this time it swung easily. The room was the room. The light was the light. The floor was the friendly river. And she, who had sung to spoons and dogs and the invisible woman at the back of the room, stepped forward and breathed and saved nothing for later.Chapter Six

The morning they called it a brand, she laughed and then realised nobody else was laughing. The room had one wall of polite glass and one wall of a whiteboard where somebody had drawn arrows from her name to words like “authentic,” “seaside,” and “relatable.” Someone had also drawn a gull and given it sunglasses. Executive wore a shirt the colour of meetings and spoke about “owning the niche” as though a seaside town were a cloud storage account. Lorna sat with a pen poised in the air as if it were a small bridge she might put down. Saj leaned against the radiator that didn’t work but performed radiator as a role, and watched Maisie as if she were a person she could trust to name a fire.

“We’re thinking power ballad this week,” said Executive, undeterred by the presence of the radiator. “Keep the arc upward. Uplift. Give us the note again, but higher, longer, sustained. We’ll put you in something white that looks like sincerity under lights. Maybe wind. The audience loves wind.”

“I love wind,” Maisie said. “When it’s outside doing what it does. I was thinking something smaller. Slower. A song that knows how to talk, not shout. We could do it spare. A guitar or a piano and a space big enough for the words to sit down. It has a slide in it I can stand on. It’s not—” She searched for the word that wasn’t old-fashioned or timid or niche. “It’s not loud. But it’s true.”

Executive smiled in the way of men who understand trains and not tides. “We can make truth loud,” he said. “That’s our job. We help people hear it.”

Dan, who had arrived with a coffee and the expression of a person who knows bad posture when he sees it, cleared his throat. “Her instrument loves room,” he said, in a tone that disguised advocacy as technical advice. “If we put too many notes around her, we’ll steal the air. Let her carry quiet. It will read.”

Saj said nothing and then said something. “The clip from the café is at a million,” she offered, as if dropping a biscuit into a teacup to see whether it would sink. “People are saying they can hear the kettle. They like that. If we make her into weather, they’ll say we changed the forecast.” She directed a look at Executive like a post-it, brightly-coloured and square. “We can save wind for later. The warehouse has not run out.”

There was a small silence. The whiteboard gull stared into a future it could not control. Executive tapped the pen he had borrowed from nobody. Lorna wrote down something that could have been “spare arrangement?” or “spare eyebrow?” or “remember to breathe,” her shorthand as ambiguous as air. Finally, Executive gave a little shrug you could translate as a green light if you were trained in optimism. “Fine,” he said. “Spare. But not dull. And we need a moment for camera. The camera is part of the choir.”

“We’ll teach it harmony,” Maisie said. “Give me the song and the room, and I’ll bring it to the lens.”

Out in the corridor, with its carpet that had opinions about suitcases, Saj fell into step with her. “You held the line,” she murmured. “Good. The line exists because you drew it. We will find you a guitarist who listens.”

“I have a guitarist in mind,” said Maisie, thinking of Albie’s hands on a fretboard like someone deciding how to love something properly. “If we’re allowed to keep it in-house.”

“We are allowed,” Saj said. “The rules are permeable when applied with confidence.”

Word threaded down the day, through the hall like a piece of gossip that had decided to be helpful. Albie came to the rehearsal room with a guitar that had the dings of a useful life and said, “You’re certain?” in a voice that asked both about chords and friendship. Nova sat cross-legged on a case and watched with her chin in her hand, her eyes doing the quick moving of somebody who was building a memory to keep. Dan stood by the piano like a person at a bar he trusted.

They played the first verse as if the floor might break. Albie found the slide she had promised and rode it down into gentle. The melody unfurled with the weight of nothing more than honesty. There was a moment where the line hit a vowel that asked her to remember a kitchen that smelt of steam and lemon paint, and she widened it the way she had been taught and the air became something she could see. Dan nodded without showing his teeth and scratched a note on his page. Nova let out a small, involuntary “oh,” which told Maisie she had been brave enough and only that.

“Again,” Dan said, soft enough that it wasn’t an order. “This time let the breath sit behind the words like a chair you’re willing to use.”

They ran it until the furniture of it knew her. They tried the bridge with a different shape under it and then returned to the shape her body chose first. They argued about nothing in particular that meant everything—capo or not, rubato here or there, whether a heartbeat should be left in or taken out. It became not a plan but a place. It became a corridor she could walk down and find a door open.

The clip from Eastbourne aired that afternoon in the hour before a news bulletin full of necessary sorrow and football. The dog was a star in three time zones by tea. Mrs. Pike became a meme with the caption “mouth that does good work,” which, to her credit, she didn’t mind once she understood that people were laughing with her and not at her. The boy with the skateboard texted her a photograph of his gran pointing at the telly with a wooden spoon like it had offended her and then hugging it. The café was busier for an hour than it had any right to be at four-fifteen, and Jai sent a video of himself doing a mock-press conference at the counter, answering questions from customers with a colander as a microphone. “No, we will not be selling dog-eaten pastries,” he said, perfectly pompous. “Yes, you may take a photograph of the jam. No, I cannot reveal our tart supplier; she wears a cape and comes in at night.”

Len refused to be filmed live because “I don’t do television that talks back,” but he allowed Maureen to record him on a phone raising a cup of tea in salute. The video had his slipper in it and half his face, which only increased its charm. Her mother sent a message that said, in its entirety, He stole a tart and spared the crust, which I think is a metaphor for men, followed by three kisses and a shopping list of things she thought might be necessary for Fame, including a lint roller and humility.

By evening there were three vans outside the hotel and a man with a camera who was not attached to a call sheet. He had the stance of a person who trusted himself to be disliked. When she came through the revolving door with Nova and their day packaged neatly under their arms, he took four photographs with the speed of someone trying to win a prize at a fair. He called her name as if they had been introduced at a party ten years ago. “Maisie,” he said, almost kindly. “Give us a smile. Give us a little chin. Give us an Eastbourne.”

She didn’t stop long enough to decide whether to be clever. She gave him the chin she was born with and the smile she had rented from a kind day and the straight back that came from needing to walk through noise. Saj materialised between lenses and said, “No questions tonight, lads,” in a voice that had a velvet rope built into it. Nova walked butterfly-gentle but kept going. In the lift, breath caught up with them, ripped its tights, swore, and then pretended it hadn’t.

“Do I have to learn how to walk from the car to the door?” Nova asked, pulling her hair into a shape that did not declare defeat.

“You already know,” Maisie said. “It’s the same walk as to the stage. You pretend the ground is your friend and you don’t say sorry to anyone you don’t know.”

“Teach a class,” Nova said, and then, because they could, they took each other’s hands for the sixty seconds to the seventh floor.

The week did what weeks do when they are full: it grew a second spine and held everything up anyway. Rehearsals were disciplined and kind until they weren’t, because someone hadn’t slept or a screen had failed to do the right picture at the right time or an intern put the wrong name on the wrong sandwich. People said, “All good,” and meant “mostly good.” People said, “We move,” and meant “we refuse to drown.” Dan was a metronome and a priest and a man with a spare cough sweet in his pocket. Lorna had an argument in the hall with a person whose job could be summarised as “No,” and walked away with a small smile you could not help but admire. Saj kept the doors opening at the right moment and the wrong ones locked and the phones pointed away from hearts. Executive came and peered and nodded and left, as if he were an eagle pretending to be a pigeon.

The day of the show she woke brittle and then softened under tea. She did the ridiculous mouth shapes while drying her hair, and her reflection in the hotel mirror did them back with a straight face, which felt like solidarity. In the breakfast room, a man from another world told her he loved her dress without looking up from his eggs; she said thank you, then remembered she wasn’t wearing it and laughed into her toast. Nova had slept badly and wore it like eyeliner. Albie was already at the piano on his floor when she wandered through and he said, without pausing his hands, “I’ve got you,” which she believed the way you believe gravity when you step.

They dressed her in the blue again because the dress had decided to be a friend. Hair moved but did not rustle. Someone glued a wire behind her ear in a way that felt like trust. Saj handed her a note card with three questions she might be asked and three answers she would not give, because some things did not belong to twenty cameras and the internet’s morning-after. One was about her father. One was about whether she had a boyfriend. One was about whether she had a plan for losing, as if losing were a place with a map and a gift shop. She slid the card into her shoe like a talisman and took two stupidly deep breaths that made Dan nod approvingly from across the room like a man who had been consulted and found his advice obeyed.

In the lineup, in the wings, there was a smell of hairspray and nerves fried in butter. The girl with the peach hair, Nova’s new friend called Tansy, whispered that she had forgotten how to count and hoped counting wasn’t involved. A stagehand with tattoos of ships on his forearms called them “sweethearts” without being demeaning and set them on their marks with the gentleness of a person putting bread in an oven. The host glanced at his cue cards as if they were written in a language he had learned for money. The lights rose into their useful joy. Someone in the audience already had a sign with Maisie’s name on it that glinted like a lake. She wanted, just for a charcoal second, to be the person in the audience holding a sign for someone else.

Albie looked at her across the black river of the stage like a man about to swim with his guitar as a buoy. He did a small nod that looked like a spell. The red light went from friendly to important. The music started, not louder than conversation, but intimate, like a cousin. The room came close, the way rooms do when they are listening properly. She sang the first line as if there were only one person to hear it and that person wasn’t her. The words sat where she’d put chairs for them. The second line had a drop like a small hill on a bicycle. She didn’t wobble. She didn’t apologise. She did as Dan had asked and let her breath be behind the word like a chair she trusted. In the bridge, something shifted that had nothing to do with microphones and everything to do with permission. She gave herself more and the room came closer and then stepped back, respecting the distance, a dance taught without teaching.

The camera was there when she glanced for it, not a predator, not a friend, but an eye doing its job. She gave it a moment not choreographed—a tiny smile at a place where a smile didn’t belong, because she’d heard a woman in the front row sigh for a reason she didn’t know. Albie’s fingers did the slide that had felt like a question and now was an answer. The last note did not need to be as high as last week’s or as long. It needed to be clean and true and unafraid, and so it was. The quiet afterwards was the kind of quiet that proves noise exists.

They didn’t whoop like she was a feat of engineering. They breathed out like they had been held and then released. Somewhere a man coughed because he had forgotten how not to. Backstage, Nova hugged her with eyes wet that she refused to acknowledge as wet. Dan did the circle again and added a second circle, which was not a thing he did often. Saj pressed her hand once as if transferring a spell. Lorna’s grin had real teeth in it. Executive gave a thumbs-up you could tell he had practised in a mirror and did not mind being seen practising.

The judges did their dance. One talked about control as if it were a horse. Another talked about authenticity and nearly meant it. The third corrected a word that did not need correcting and then said something about Eastbourne that was almost accurate. She thanked them with the grace of a person taking a compliment and returning the wrapping. The host tried to make her say the phrase “journey” and she gave him “week” instead, which he pocketed like a coin and moved on to a person with a bigger hairpiece.

In the chaos just before results, Saj pulled her into the little quiet room that had already learned her shape. “Two things,” she said, leaning on the door so softly it didn’t know it was being asked to help. “One: they love the dog. That’s helpful news. Two: a reporter is asking about the message. The ‘I heard you. Proud anyway’ one. They mention a name you have not used. I have said, ‘No comment.’ We can say, ‘Private.’ We can say, ‘Irrelevant.’ Or we can say nothing, which is a verb. The choice is yours and also mine, but I ask you first.”

The room tipped a little, the way a boat does when a wave passes under it and the captain doesn’t flinch. Maisie felt the five words in the pocket of her cardigan though they were not physically there. She thought of the man on the promenade offering her a hole to climb into, of the cake and the crust and the dog who shared what he didn’t need. She thought of her mother and the recorder and the drawer that hummed. She thought of thirteen and of seventeen and of twenty-two, and of how being watched was not the same as being seen.

“Say nothing,” she said, with a steadiness that surprised the part of her that had wanted to be generous to strangers. “Say I’m at work. Say the kettle’s on.”

“Done,” Saj said, touching her shoulder in a way that felt like a small medal pinned inside a jacket. “And if anyone asks you, you can say, ‘Not today.’ It’s a full sentence.”

The results came like the sea—inevitable, dramatic if you stood in the wrong place, and wet with other people’s feelings. The lights remembered how to frighten. Names were called as if they were doors opening and closing in a corridor where you had left coats. Albie went through and looked back once as if this were a game of statues and not career. Nova’s name was late enough that Maisie’s stomach found religion. When it came, Nova made the soft-gasp noise of a person who has postponed a cry and it leaked anyway. Maisie’s name arrived in the middle, not early enough to be arrogance, not late enough to be a story. They stood together because that was what they’d decided to do, two girls from nationally different corners of the same need, and when a boy with too much certainty did not get called, they made room for his sadness without absorbing it.

Afterwards, under the crush of hair and wire and human, she found the corridor that had become hers. It smelt like paint cooling and luck. Her phone was where she had left it with the face turned away. She let it stay that way for a minute longer. She let herself lean against the wall as if the wall were something like home. Saj appeared with crisps, which was a kind of sacrament. Dan appeared with sense, which was another. Lorna appeared with paperwork and love disguised as a list. “There will be more of them now,” she said, meaning vans and lenses and questions and hands. “There is a percentage of them who will remember they are people and a percentage who will forget. We surround you with the first and keep the second as far as possible. If any of them say ‘journey’ at you more than once, I am authorised to hiss.”

“I can hiss,” Maisie said. “I hissed at a man once who put his finger into a cake to check it was real.”

“How did he respond,” Lorna asked, looking delighted, as if she were collecting souvenirs of resistance from the field.

“He apologised to the cake,” Maisie said, and the room, such as it was, laughed and the laughter did the thing it always does when it is honest: improved the air.

Back at the hotel, late and not late, she took the pins out of her hair and put them on the desk in a pattern that could have been a constellation. She washed her face and watched her own skin return like a tide that knew its times. She sat on the bed with her knees up and the duvet compressed under her like the lap of a giant and she allowed herself ten minutes to watch the clip with the dog again, because sometimes the soft thing is the medicine. She texted her mother: Not today, and her mother replied: Well done. There is trifle.

She wrote in the notebook because if she didn’t, the day would have nowhere to live and might turn into gas. She wrote: I held the quiet and it held me back. She wrote: Wind later. She wrote: Say nothing is a sentence. She drew a dog that looked like a seagull wearing boots and laughed at herself alone in a high room.

Sleep came as if it had been watching and waiting for its cue. At three she woke as always and listened to the city shifting its shoulder in the sheets. She thought about the next song without deciding anything. She allowed herself a little luxury and imagined an after that involved a stage she chose, a band that knew her vowels and didn’t ask them to change, a small tour of seaside places where the gulls would pretend to know the choruses, and a café she could return to in the mornings to dry spoons and be told she was still part of the furniture. She let the image be generous without making promises it couldn’t keep.

In the morning, the vans were still there and the man with the camera had been replaced by a man with a microphone whose hair looked as if it had been argued with into shape. Downstairs in the lobby a little girl approached wearing a coat the colour of apples and a courage that had been sewn on by somebody careful. She held out a napkin on which she had drawn, in pencil, a person with a big mouth and a dog with a bigger one. “This is you,” she said, without self-consciousness. “And this is the dog. He likes your voice.”

Maisie took the napkin like it was paper and then held it like it was porcelain. “Will you sign it for me,” she asked the girl, because that was the only correct response. The girl wrote her name in the middle of the dog with the seriousness children give to important work. Her mother hovered in the distance, instructing the air to be kind. “Thank you,” Maisie said, with the weight such a small transaction deserved. “You’ve made my day before tea.”

They had a day off in the schedule, which meant a day in which fewer people would ask her to stand here or be that. She walked a stretch of river with Nova and declined to be photographed on a bench by a man whose camera had learned to forget faces. They went into a museum and looked at paintings of skies, all different, and wondered how it is that people can love the same thing fifty ways. They ate chips from paper and blessed salt aloud as if it were a minor god. They did not talk about fathers or fear. They talked about fruit they didn’t like as children and fruit they pretended to like now, trilobites and haircuts and a woman on the bus who had knitted a hat for the weather and then the weather had decided to change and she wore it cheerful anyway.

By the time rehearsals resumed, the dog had done two morning shows and one biscuit advert without knowing it. Eastbourne had broken the till drawer twice with the weight of coins. Mrs. Pike had acquired an apron with the words “Mouth That Does Good Work” embroidered by a woman who did embroidery when her cat allowed it, and had worn it ironically which, for Mrs. Pike, meant only that she acknowledged it existed. The boy with the skateboard was learning to make coffee without Jai saying “No, see, tilt,” and the terrier had started sitting outside the Driftwood as if expecting applause. Len had discovered emojis and sent her three of a letter and one of a fish and one of a man who could only be a postman if you believed in miracles. Her mother had sent her a photograph of a trifle that had become a landscape, which she praised without admitting she preferred crumble.

At the end of that week’s first run-through, Dan stopped her on the way out with a hand that asked only a moment. “You’re getting good at not apologising,” he said, and the twinkle was only half a twinkle. “Watch for the apology creeping into the smile. It’s a British habit. You can smile without giving something back. Try it in front of the mirror and you’ll see yourself grow half an inch.”

“I see myself enough,” she said, but she took it, because he was right and because the work was a thing she liked to hold. In the stairwell between floors she practised two smiles, one that gave away bus fares and the other that didn’t, and was astonished at the difference it made to her own breath. A stagehand coming up with a coil of tape saw her and gave her a look that said, We all try things in stairwells, and kept going.

There was a night midweek when the hotel felt like the inside of a clock and she went to the bar with the carpet that hid more than it revealed and found a corner where she could be a person having a drink and not a person being assessed. A man came over with the careful tilt of someone with something to say and she braced, then relaxed. It was the camera guy who had laughed with his mouth closed. He said, “That second verse was clean,” and then, because he was smart, he didn’t say more. She raised her glass and he raised his and they did not talk about anything that could be monetised. It was a relief the size of a thousand small things.

In bed that night she thought briefly of the message with its five words and for the first time it did not make her ribs flutter. It sat in the corner like a coat nobody was wearing, and that was fine. She slept and dreamed not of the pier in lights but of the café with the bell that worked and tea towels as prizes and a dog who stole something you cared for and somehow improved it by making it a story. In the morning, she woke and the day organised itself obediently into breakfast, breath, stage, and the kind of work that feels like you could spend your life doing it without minding the weather. She sat for make-up and let someone paint on bravery that matched the bravery she brought and thought, quietly and without theatre, I am doing the thing, and if there was ever a sentence worth getting out of bed for, that was it.Chapter Eight began with a newspaper on a breakfast table that did not belong to her, a photograph cropped so closely it felt like a hand over a mouth. She didn’t see it first. A man at the next table rearranged his cutlery into a domestic constellation and tutted at the headline as if the letters had personally misbehaved, then rotated the paper and left the page where anyone could read it, the way people leave half-eaten fruit for birds and tell themselves it’s charity. There was her face, but tighter, and a name beside it she had kept in a drawer with batteries and things you don’t throw away in case fate requires you to prove you once believed in them. The caption did the thing captions do when they want to be both a knife and a handkerchief. It said Proud anyway, as if generosity were a stain that would not come out.

Saj appeared in the breakfast room as if she’d been hiding behind the croissants, which was a trick Maisie wouldn’t put past her. She set down a small pot of jam like a bargaining chip and didn’t look at the paper, which was exactly the kindness required. “We’re handling it,” she said, in a voice that had the weight of a person placing a lid on a boiling pan. “Legal will call the desk. We say nothing except that you’re at work, which you are, and that your family is not a storyline, which it isn’t. If anybody thrusts a microphone at your mouth with the question, I will place my hand between the microphone and the question, and they will interview my palm. Eat something that forgives you while we do that.”

It was a neat plan, as most good plans are when they are drawn on clean air before the weather gets involved. The paper was only the first welcome committee. In the lobby, a man with a camera and a boy with a notebook hopped from one foot to the other as if the carpet were lava and only the question could save them. Outside, a van sat like a patient predator, windows darkened to imply important thoughts being had about your life. In her phone, the message multiplied, copied, pasted, embellished, picked up by the pieces of the internet that pretend to be neighbours and love to borrow your sugar. Uncles she’d never met wrote paragraphs about duty and daughters under photos from last summer of a choir in a park, and schoolfriends she hadn’t spoken to since GCSEs suddenly remembered she existed and had always known she was special. Her mother texted: I am not answering the door. Maureen is on guard. We have deployed a tray of biscuits as distraction if necessary. The biscuits are brave.

She did not cry because crying would have given it a shape, and she refused to hand over architecture to strangers. She ate toast slowly and imagined the toast as an ally, which worked as well as anything. Nova slid into the chair with all the grace of a person who had just been told she looked good in a colour she hated. “They’ve found my dad too,” she said, light as paper. “Different paper, different haircut, same hunger. Saj says to say nothing. I am good at saying nothing when I care. I am not good at saying nothing when I do not care, which is strange.”

“Let’s go to the river and ignore bridges,” Maisie said, as if rivers were something you could schedule. “Five minutes, then we will come back and behave like a people who live on taped-down marks. We will breathe and pretend there is only room for oxygen.”

They walked as far as the metal railings and the morning performing its good behaviour. The city presented its best concrete and its least threatening pigeons and three joggers in a row considered not being in the way and failed. It was enough to reset the little gears that had jumped in her chest when she saw the headline. On the way back, a woman passed them carrying a florist’s box that had been designed for the delivery of softness. She stopped, looked at Maisie with a face that did not edit, and said, “You sang and I felt myself stand up inside,” then went on her way because people have lives, because that is the only thing keeping the world upright.

In the rehearsal room the piano was already open at the page that made room for knees. Dan stood as if he were about to tell good news in a saner world, and Albie had his guitar in the lap position that means the day is willing. They all knew enough to ignore the buzzing. Work, if you let it, grows hands and shields you because it wants to be done. They went through the song for the third time like people carrying cups carefully. They shaved half a second off a pause not because anyone would notice but because they would, and the noticing would make them sit straighter just before the line that needed straightening. They tried the bridge again with a tilt, and finally the melody accepted their offer. When she sang the line about going home and not meaning geography, she felt the sound sit perfectly in the middle of her mouth and stay there, polite and obstinate.

A runner appeared with a message on a laminated card like a prophecy that had to be wiped between uses. It said MEDIA HOLD: FIRM. Lorna poked her head around the door next, hair doing its two-tasks-at-once thing, and said, “Executive wants you to do a soft thank-you to ‘everyone who’s reached out’ when you’re on the couch. Not the name. Not the story. Just a thank-you. You don’t have to. We can ignore it. But if it will help them feel fed and leave you alone, we can try. Your call.” She didn’t look at the paper in her hand that had the word “narrative” on it in clean type. She looked at Maisie the way you look at a fire that might go everywhere and might also go out and not be the end of the world.

“I can do a thank-you that’s also a do-not,” Maisie said, trying her mouth around the balance and feeling it hold. “I can do a handful of politeness without selling the kitchen. I will talk about kindness and cakes and doors. I will talk about doors.”

“Talk about doors,” Lorna said, with the same small relief she had when a mic worked the first time. “Doors are out of fashion. You can bring them back.”

The day seemed to have decided not to be generous, so it gave them oddness instead. Halfway through a lighting check, the wind machine for another act fell in love with the switch and refused to be turned off. A, B and C plan tried to coax it back into friendship, and finally a man called Kev, who had the shoulders of a man who had convinced many objects to behave, murmured to it in a soft Midlands tone and the thing sighed and gave up drama. In the corridor, Nova practised wink-smiling at her reflection and announced she was terrible at wink-smiling and would therefore invent a new expression that meant “I am pleased to be here but nobody owns my eyebrows.” In the break room someone had put out a bowl of bananas with a sign that said “PLEASE EAT ME,” then someone else had crossed out “ME” and written “BANANAS,” and this was somehow exactly the size of joke everyone could handle.

The café clip was still rising like bread left in a warm room. Mrs. Pike had sent a photograph of herself with a man from the council in front of the pastry display. The man had his serious tie on and a grin like the top of a lighthouse and was shaking hands with a tray. The caption, in Jai’s handwriting, said: Council recognises tart’s contribution to civic morale. The terrier had, according to the boy with the skateboard, been recognised twice on the seafront with the phrase “There he is,” which had made the dog look over his shoulder as if perhaps the other he was just behind him. Len sent no commentary, just a photograph of the horizon sliced by a gull and underneath it a row of stamps lined up like teeth, which was either an accident or a poem.

By the time the red light woke properly for the live part, Maisie had reached the calm that comes not from courage but from the body being sensible. She took her place as if she had been born there and left twice and returned because it was the only reasonable choice. The stage had been made into the kind of room her song needed, which is to say the room was acting like a room and not a spaceship. Albie’s face had settled into that calm he inherited from older women and boats. The audience had arranged themselves into one large listening creature. She sang, and the note that mattered came out dressed like itself and not a guest, and she did not think of newspapers except in the way you think of ships when you are on a field; as a different kind of distance.

The trouble came two bars from the end, when the monitor in her ear misheard the world and threw back a sound that wasn’t hers. It was the kind of mistake that makes people bargain with physics. She saw Dan’s head turn in the darkness, saw Albie’s neck muscle twitch at the edge of the last chord, saw the floor conduct calm. She did the thing you do when a kettle suddenly stops sounding like a kettle. She took the earpiece out, quick, one motion, and put it in her palm like an egg. She stepped half an inch closer to the mouth of the room, which is to say the audience, and trusted that air is not just an absence. For four bars she sang naked of equipment and the room remembered it had been built to carry voices before it was taught to react to cameras. It carried her. The note found the ceiling and did not get lost on the way back. When she finished, the quiet that followed the quiet was generous. Somewhere a headset muttered a swear of admiration in an accent you could not quite place.

Backstage, people who were paid to be calm allowed themselves miniature celebrations, the luxury of impressed eyebrows and professional smiles that almost broke into parties. Dan pressed her shoulder in the exact place that said “work” and “well done,” and Lorna told her she would never mention wind again in relation to Executive’s dreams. Saj handed her water that had been cold in an intelligent way and said, “I think you just started a trend called ‘remembering how to human.’ If they ask you about it, it was a technical. If they ask you about the paper, doors.”

On the couch, under lights that pretend to be scrutiny and are mostly heat, she did her thank-you. She thanked people for messages that were kind and said nothing about the ones that were not and did not at any point perform an anecdote. She spoke about spoons and kettles and doors, and the host tried to turn spoons into fathers because that is what hosts must try to do if they want to keep their chair. She took the word back and made it about tea, and the audience, which is a clever animal when trained, made the noise people make when they recognise someone refusing a story without being rude to the furniture. It was, in the scale of victories, small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and important enough to hold warm with your hands.

That night the vans multiplied at the kerb like mushrooms after rain. Saj reorganised exits like a general who had never lost a battle because she refused to fight one she couldn’t win. In the revolving door a man in a coat that didn’t fit tried a question with her name on it and she smiled with the correct ratio of teeth to restraint and said, “Not today,” and walked, and the walk was a kind of language. Upstairs, the corridor did its good work of purring. Nova texted a string of emojis that appeared to mean either “I have discovered eyeliner” or “I have tamed a mythical beast,” and then arrived and threw herself on the bed as if gravity were optional. “You witch,” she said, full of love that was relief. “You made an accident look like a choice.”

“It was a choice,” Maisie said. “The choice not to panic. It turns out I have a choice. I have more choices than I thought. I might start choosing for sport.”

“Choose chips,” Nova said, already half asleep in a position that would make a chiropractor sigh, and then said, blurred, “They’re going to make you talk about him again. Just… don’t be the soup. Be the bowl.”

“I am a bowl,” Maisie said, which in another life would have been an odd sentence to say to a friend while both were fully clothed, but here, in this life, was doctrine. She tucked a blanket over Nova as if preparing a small animal for hibernation. Then she sat in the chair by the window, because chairs in hotel rooms are there for people to sit in while remembering. A small square envelope was tucked under the door in that particular way hotel staff manage when they want you to believe magic still exists. There was a neat hand on the front that belonged to nobody in her modern life, the slanted script that predates keyboards. Inside was a recipe card, stained with butter in a corner, for jam tarts. The ingredients were in Len’s slow capitals, each line a kindness. At the bottom, he had written: Remember the crust holds the jam and not the other way round. Under that, like a PS that had slipped out of the mouth of the first sentence: Also, I told the man at the gate that he was trespassing on my good mood. He apologised to my hedges.

She slept with the card under her pillow, which did nothing and also did everything. In the morning, the paper had become other papers, and the van had become a different van. The city wore yesterday as a scarf and considered the day with a professional face. Saj had arranged a decoy exit and three decoy smiles and an actual one for luck. In the lift, a housekeeper with a trolley full of beautifully folded forgiveness looked at Maisie and then away and then back and said, “You were brave when the ear thing went,” in the tone a person uses to name a colour when paint has dried. It was a small ribbon she pinned to her inside.

The day off that wasn’t off landed unexpectedly in the schedule like snow that had looked on the forecast and decided to be less trouble. It rained politely, the sort of rain that wants to be liked. She went to Eastbourne because she could. The train did not object. The platform received her without applause, which was a relief so pure it made her clumsy for a second. She walked through the underpass and the town opened itself like it always had, indifferent to fame and gossip and heavily stapled schedules, and therefore a kind of church.

At the Driftwood, Jai had constructed a shrine to the dog consisting of a saucer with a single biscuit and a sign reading HONEST THIEF. Mrs. Pike swatted away a camera crew from a show with a name that used the word celebrity as if it were a medical term and told them they could film the outside of her bun if they filed a request in writing. The boy with the skateboard reported that his gran had waved at her on the telly and then complained that the lighting wasn’t flattering to their wallpaper, which meant she was feeling better. The terrier came in without being invited, because it had become impossible to tell that dog where to be, and it sat at her feet with the dignity of an animal who had been to London in spirit.

She made tea because sometimes being useful is more important than being adored. She wiped down a table because cloths are therapy with texture. A tourist from a motorway town said, “Oh, it really is you,” as if she had been supposed to be an actor hired to play herself. She cut cake and talked about sugar with a woman who told her she had watched the performance from her hospital bed and had clapped so gently with the back of her hand that the nurse cried. She went down to the pier with Len because he consented to walk if the wind was in a giving mood and stopped at the part where the boards sound like music. He told her about a parcel that had arrived open and a note he had written that said, “Arrived in this condition,” and the way the recipient had phoned to say thank you for the honesty. “People think honesty is expensive,” he said. “It is cheaper than the alternative. Remember that when you are tempted to buy silence on credit.”

She told him about the recipe card and he grinned like a boy and claimed no knowledge and then asked if the dog in question had forgiven the tart. On the way back, the man from the promenade saw her again and began a sentence with “Your father—” and she stopped, and held up a hand like a person crossing a road at a zebra, and said, “Not today,” gently, like a person pointing out a cliff to a visitor, and he flushed, and he said, “Sorry, love,” and they both carried on being human, which felt like a win on a day with rain.

The next show week had decided to be hard. The theme was not a theme but a box with “big songs” printed on it in a font that made people feel unnecessary pressure. Executive wanted power and wind. The lights wanted to be edited into something that could be put online with a word like “iconic.” Dan wanted vowels and rest and a room. Saj wanted doors. Maisie wanted the exact smallness she could hold without giving away her bones. They compromised by building something that felt like a streetlight at dusk. She chose an older song that had nothing to prove and therefore proved everything. Executive raised an eyebrow that had been paid for and asked if perhaps a medley might be more commercial, and she said, “I am not a medley,” which made Lorna snort into her notes because she treasured every sentence that forced the room to be sharper than it had been.

Albie’s week had sharp corners. He had been bottom two for reasons outside of talent and inside of fate, and he was tired in his eyes, which is the kind of tired that retinol cannot touch. He smiled and said, “We move,” which meant “I will stand up even if my knees are bored,” and his hands did beautiful things to the guitar that you only notice if you have ever tried to make a thing respond to being asked nicely. Nova had been assigned a costume that looked like a metaphor and refused to wear it, which led to a corridor conversation that ended with her wearing trousers and a grin that scared three men and a frog. They all stopped to eat at a table designed by a person who believed elbows are rude, and they put their elbows on it with intent, and that small act of rebellion tasted exactly like chips would have tasted if the rehearsal had finished on time.

The show went as shows do when more people are watching: like an animal trained to accept noise in exchange for food. There were better songs than the songs deserved and worse ones than talent allowed. There was a boy who forgot a line and remembered grace. There was a woman with a dress that had opinions and an audience that adored it. When it was Maisie’s turn, the room gave her the courtesy of filling the right places and not the wrong ones. She looked at Albie across the stage and felt for a second what it would be like to do this without him, and she had to breathe twice before the first line would come. She sang and the song did what old songs do when asked by a new mouth; it yielded and it argued and in the end it sat down beside her and shared the view.

The judges found adjectives in their pockets and some of them were the right ones. The host asked her if being “our café songbird” felt like a responsibility, and she said it felt like a shift rota, and there was laughter in the right places. When the results came, they came like the tide only if the tide had to pause and listen to a sponsor. Albie’s name was late. It was the kind of late that makes you count the names you can’t see and reckon odds and push down doom with your knee. When it came, it did not come. He stood well. He went to sing for his life with steady hands and a throat that did not betray him, and still the room and the maths and the map of the week decided otherwise. He bowed like a boat at a dock because he knew how to leave with dignity and without interpretation. He hugged her and his arms said the thing his mouth couldn’t say because not crying in public is a game people play even when the rules hurt. “You’ve got it,” he said, the exact three words he had to give away, and then he went off in the manner of men taught by older women, which is to say upright and unblaming.

She didn’t sleep much that night. Sleep was there, hovering with the bedside lamp and the hotel pen and the usual humility, but every time she reached it, a thought tugged her sleeve and asked if she had remembered to be kind, if she had stolen any lines, if she could have argued harder for anything that mattered, if she could bear doing this without the steady companionship of a guitar that understood her more than some people would. At three, a message arrived from Len like a lighthouse blink. It said: Boats leave. Harbours remain. Don’t turn into a harbour. Be a boat with a kettle. It was the strangest, dearest sentence, and somehow it allowed her to close her eyes with something like peace.

Morning did not ask permission. It found her and put tea in her hand and sent her downstairs to a room where Executive had drawn new arrows on the whiteboard. The gull had acquired an expression. There was a fresh plan for a duet week that involved pairing her with someone whose name made publicity men purr. Lorna was going to find the boat. Dan had already located his replacement, a house guitarist with long fingers and listening ears who introduced himself as Marta and shook her hand like a promise. Saj wrote DOORS in the corner and underlined it until the pen made a squeak that sounded like victory.

They went to the river because the city had given them one that morning and it seemed ungrateful not to look. Nova walked with her hands in her pockets as if pockets had been designed to hold courage. “Are you all right,” she asked, because asking is work too, and Maisie said, “I am sad and I am grateful and I am still wanting to sing,” and that was the most honest inventory she was capable of. They paused on a bridge with the usual padlocks and all the ordinary tourists and it occurred to her that nothing remarkable was visible from that angle, that the remarkable was happening in a hundred kitchens and a thousand birds and in one girl from a town where the tide has opinions who had decided she would have them too.

Her phone vibrated, not with a van or a paper or a man in a coat, but with the name she had left un-open like a cupboard that smells of something you aren’t ready to face. It was not five words this time. It was two, and they were the only two that made sense and caused trouble in equal measure. It said: I’m here. She looked at the words as if they were city pigeons, familiar and opportunistic. She was in a place with pigeons and also in a place where the gulls waited. She could not control which bird came closer. She slid the phone back into her pocket and let the words sit with the crumbs.

The café sent her a photograph of a new chalkboard in Jai’s carefully chaotic hand. It read: SOUP OF THE DAY: BOUNDARIES. COMES WITH BREAD. She sent back a drawing of a door with a lock and a heart and under it a kettle and the words I’m a boat, and Jai replied with a string of sailor emojis that did not exist but should. She messaged Albie to say nothing at all in sentences and everything in spaces and he wrote back a picture of the sea near his mother’s, flat as a sheet, and the phrase Play on, which could have been about music or life or the way some people give you exactly not enough and somehow it is enough.

She went to rehearsal and her feet found the floor and her mouth found the note and her breath found the chair behind the word. She stood on the mark that had had her name written on it so many times it had become part of the stage, and she looked up into lights that were trying their best and she said to herself under the noise and the plan and the want and the fear: I know my bones. She said it again, because there are sentences you are supposed to repeat until the room learns them with you. She imagined the Driftwood quiet with the day’s last cups, the lemon paint forgiving faults the way good colours do, the dog asleep beside the door dreaming of tarts, Len turning off a light with the seriousness of a ceremony, her mother washing a spoon and thinking of old songs and nonsense, and she let the picture make a home for the bit of her that had room for no more newspapers.

The duet week was going to be a circus. It was the kind of television where somebody in a high room imagined chemistry like a chemical and then pretended it could be measured with ratings. They paired her with a man whose first name was enough, who had been loud ten years ago and then quieter and now loud again with the authority of a person who had sold both vinyl and streaming. He arrived in rehearsal in a jacket the colour of someone else’s mood and hugged her like a cousin at a funeral and said, “You do your thing, I won’t get in your way,” which was either humility or a plan. His voice slid under hers like a hand under a plate; she could not tell yet if he would tilt or steady. They chose a song that did not make anyone roll their eyes, and they agreed on a key that did not betray either of their ageing frets. He told her a story about performing drunk in Hull in 2009 that had nothing to do with anything and somehow helped.

Later, in the corridor with the carpet that forgave ridiculous shoes, she found Saj leaning against the radiator which still did not work. “How do you feel about tomorrow,” Saj asked, not a producer now but a person with a face at the end of a day. “I will not accept ‘fine’ unless it comes with evidence.”

“I feel like a chair with three good legs,” Maisie said. “It stands but you shouldn’t sit suddenly. I feel like a boat with a kettle. I feel like the city is starting to recognise my walk and I am getting proud of the way my ankles don’t lie. I feel like if one more stranger says the word proud at me I will put it in a jar and label it and never open it again.”

“Good,” Saj said, which is to say she heard everything. “We will keep jars. We will keep labels. We will open the ones we choose when we choose. And if they ask you again on the couch about him, I will hiss, and you will be the bowl and not the soup, and we will go for chips that are salted like a religion and eat them in defiance of narrative.”

They laughed, and the laugh repaired something you could not name. Then the building breathed, juddered, swallowed its own noise, laid out its corridors like a promise, and handed her back to the part of the story where the stage waits to see if you will betray it. She did not. She went on. She sang. The room did the thing. And outside, where vans learn the habits of foxes, the world watched and had opinions, as it always will, while somewhere with lemon paint and a bell that works and a dog who steals only what is worth telling, a kettle boiled, and boiled, and boiled.Chapter Ten

The week learned how to take up space and then did so without apology. It spread itself over days like a map on a table big enough for elbows, and everyone leaned in until their forearms made borders. The duet had aired and become a thousand small edits, some of which were kind and some of which wore kindness as a hat, and now the show had decided that the correct answer to noise was more music. Semi-finals were a word people said like superstition, not looking it directly in the eye in case it got ideas. The schedule developed muscles in new places. Someone put a whiteboard in a room that had never hosted a whiteboard and on it wrote words like momentum and jeopardy in handwriting that looked like the receiver of many emails.

The man with one name sent flowers that were the kind you suspect would sue if you overwatered them, along with a note that said, “You made me sing better, which is rude, but I forgive you.” She left the bouquet where the runners could smell achievement and slid the card into her notebook as if it might learn to be a lyric if kept warm. Nova had slept through two alarms and woke with the complicated face of a person who had dreamt they were chased by microphones. Albie sent a photograph of a stage the size of a living room somewhere in a town without trains and the caption: Room was room. They clapped at the right places and someone cried in an honest way. He added a second message that said, in admirable defiance of the show’s insistence on being everyone's mother: Eat. Drink. Breathe down not up.

Executive called a meeting in the room with polite glass and the whiteboard gull, now wearing a cape added by an unknown hand. He smiled the way a person smiles when they have bought the right cheese from the wrong shop and intend to serve it with panache. “Semis,” he said, and the word landed on the table and tried to look casual. “We want scale without silliness. We want intimacy that reads big. And we want an original. It’s time. Can you deliver something that feels like you, but also like us, but more you than us, while still being us? Spare with a hook. Honest without liability. Maybe a key change if it doesn’t make us look desperate.”

For a second she thought she had misheard, that perhaps he had finally succumbed to the temptation of irony. Lorna tilted her head as if eavesdropping on an idea. Dan folded his arms the way choirs fold arms when the soloist is family. Saj breathed out between teeth in a way the building recognised as her preparing to run at a wall. “You want her to do her own song,” Saj said, confirming the universe had not flipped. “You want her bones in a melody, on live television, with three rehearsals and a band that can learn anything but prefers to be respected. You want quiet that can be heard in rooms where people shout. You want the thing she is most protective of on a night where the vans will breed. I love it. But if she says no, you will accept no as if it were a sonnet.”

Maisie had been writing in corners of days since Brighton. She had verses that had grown legs overnight and choruses that had sulked under beds until tempted with biscuits. She had one, though, that had lived with her long enough to know her walk. It had been born in a night where the kettle had been a metronome and the sea had sent a message in a language you can only read from a window. It wasn’t tidy. It wasn’t designed for confetti. It had a line about a spoon drawer that would make the internet write “quirky” with the kind of affection that is a trap and a kiss. But it was true, and it wouldn’t apologize for what it wasn’t. She looked at Dan and then at Saj and then at the whiteboard gull and felt the peculiar courage that comes when your fear makes tea for your stubbornness and they decide to be allies. “I have one,” she said, threatening to smile and not. “It doesn’t have a bridge that begs. It has a middle that holds. It knows where it’s going and where it refuses to go. I’d like to try it.”

Executive blinked like a man who had been surprised by an honest biscuit at a networking lunch. “We’ll need to hear it,” he said, which was reasonable and also ridiculous because hearing it in a room with bad carpet would have nothing to do with hearing it under lights. Lorna raised her pen an inch and put it down again without writing, because sometimes the recording is already in your head. Dan nodded as if he had been expecting this sentence since he met her. Saj made a small note that turned into three phone calls to the legal department because original songs come with paperwork like weather.

They took the song to a rehearsal room that didn’t mind being christened and closed the door the way people close curtains when the house across the street suddenly takes an interest. She sang it through once like a confession. She sang it again like a plan. The third time she moved a word and the room moved with it. Dan played the piano with the caution of a man transporting a cake up a narrow staircase. Marta, who had replaced Albie with competence and a kindness that never announced itself, found a line inside the chord and brought it out like a thread. Nova listened with her face and then held the silence afterwards as if it had been given to her to mind. “It’s yours,” she said simply. “And it’s ours because you’re letting it be. I hate you a little.”

Saj listened with her mouth for once and not just for her ears. “We’ll need to keep it away from people who will try to put a hat on it that says ‘ballad’ in gold,” she said, but her eyes had gone soft in a way Maisie had learned to translate as an internal yes. Executive demanded a hook and discovered that a hook can be a kindness if you don’t pull too hard. Lorna suggested a staging with less furniture and more air. The lighting designer, a man with the soul of a moth and the posture of a poet, proposed “just enough to make it legible,” and for once everyone agreed without needing to be the one who had the idea first.

While they built a stage for a song that had been born in a kitchen, the outside world did the thing it always does when it smells an opportunity to write itself in. A storm blew in from nowhere with a name that should have belonged to a dowager aunt. It pinned itself to the coast and shook out its skirts over Eastbourne with enthusiasm. The pier sulked under a tarpaulin sky and the gulls lowered their standards and shouted at bins. The news did a segment about old towns and old weather and sent a camera to ask a man in a cap what he felt, and he told them he felt like putting a jumper on, which earned him a small fame and a plate of biscuits. Jai sent a video of himself standing in the doorway of the Driftwood, hair at an angle, mug in hand, declaring, “We are open. We are always open. The soup is so committed it has turned into a stew,” and in the background the terrier appeared, took a large interest in a fallen napkin, and then left with purpose. Mrs. Pike texted to say that wind was undignified and that she’d informed it personally.

Her mother called from the hallway with the good reception and spoke in the clipped voice of a person trying not to be listened to by a house. “Your song,” she said, wasting no sentences. “Do you do that thing I tell you not to do, where you smile too much to prove you’re not afraid. Don’t smile at the song if it doesn’t ask you to. Smile at the people when it is done. The middle should look like you are reading a letter only you can see.” She paused and in the pause Maisie could hear the quiet of their kitchen and the presence of a spoon drawer she could reach with her eyes shut. “Also, Maureen says the clouds have been badly brought up.”

Len wrote on a postcard from a shop that didn’t sell postcards, “If the roof rattles, it means it’s loyal to the house. It is announcing itself. Rattling is not failure. P.S. The dog found shelter in the chapel doorway like someone with a grievance and was offered a biscuit by a woman who believes in angels. He will no doubt behave worse tomorrow as a result.” The card had a picture of a lighthouse and a price sticker that had been peeled off and replaced with a lower one, as if the sea had gone on sale. She put the postcard beside the recipe card under her pillow because talismans breed when you let them.

The night before the semi, the vans were already nesting outside the hotel like boxes with telemetry. The lobby had grown a layer of anticipation that made people raise their voices or lower them for effect. In a hallway painted the colour of conversations that go well, Nova pressed a sheet of paper into her hand, the cheap hotel stationery transformed by the act. “If they ask me about him again, I will say this,” Nova said, breathing carefully, “and then I will not say anything else. Will you read it to see if it is too much of a fence and not enough of a door.” It wasn’t. It was two sentences that said “I’m at work” and “No,” with such graciousness they felt like a hug you gave to your own boundaries. Maisie kissed her cheek and told her the fence had flowers and that was more than anyone could demand.

The morning decided to start without her and then remembered to invite her along. She woke into the kind of quiet that belongs to buildings before everyone remembers their lines. The air lay obedient. The city coughed into its sleeve. In the mirror she looked like a woman who had spent a month learning not to apologise. It suited her. Breakfast was a negotiation with toast and time. Dan appeared at her shoulder to murmur about breath and quietly engineer her into a better key for early talking. Saj slid into a chair and handed her a day the way people hand you a baby: This is happening, it is beautiful, don’t drop it, and if you do, we will tell nobody.

The run-through went wrong in acceptable ways and right in one very important way: the song did, in rehearsal, the thing the song was supposed to do. It sat in the room like a chair and invited people to sit in it properly. The crew looked up from their phones more often than they were obliged to. A rigging man with hands like rope said to nobody in particular, “My mum will like that one,” and then coughed to pretend he hadn’t meant to speak. The stage manager with kind eyes and a count-in finger touched his earpiece and said, “Again from the chorus to make the cameras feel safe,” and the cameras felt safer. Executive appeared, tapped the air like a conductor of emails, and said only, “Don’t change the second verse,” which for him was love poetry.

Outside, the storm arrived in a way that suggested it had read the call sheet. Rain came down with a professionalism you had to admire. Wind did not ask to be liked. On a different show, they would have moved a set piece and pretended to be the only thing that mattered. Here, they closed two doors and told the dog to stay inside if the hat blew off. Mrs. Pike set a mug down too hard and said, “I am not interested in weather unless it peels paint, and I don’t mean emotionally,” and everyone took comfort from her refusal to be impressed by the sky.

Two hours before showtime, a boy with a microphone who had been a boy with a notebook the week before materialised in the corridor with the carpet that forgives mistakes. He stood in front of her with the confidence of someone certain that he was about to pluck a story like a ripe pear. “Have you seen the statement,” he said without greeting, holding his phone like a mirror to a life she did not recall signing for. “He’s said he’s in town. That he’s here. That he wants to meet. That he’s proud. That—”

“Not today,” she said, and the words had become a coat she could find with her eyes shut. “Not here. Not during work. Not because you waited by a door.” The boy blinked, young enough that perhaps someone at home would see this clip later and tell him to eat more, sleep more, ask fewer questions shaped like knives. Saj slid between them with the ease of a person who has moved between teeth and skin before, and the boy was invited to consider the weather elsewhere. Maisie stood still until her skin settled back on her bones, then walked to a room with a piano and a woman called Marta and a man called Dan and a piece of paper where the second verse would not change.

Back home, the pier’s boards sang a wet song to people who had chosen to walk anyway. Len had pulled his chair closer to the window because he preferred to watch weather rather than listen to it as rumour. The terrier lay in a complicated loaf by the heater, dreaming small running dreams. Her mother had put bowls under two leaks as if this were an arrangement she had made for visitors. Jai updated the chalkboard to read: SANDWICH OF THE DAY: PROPRIETY. COMES WITH PICKLE. Mrs. Pike told a customer that perhaps this was not the afternoon for iced coffee unless they were trying to prove a point to the gods. Eastbourne was being Eastbourne, and that had become, somehow, the anchor she carried with her to rooms with ceilings that changed colour on command.

They let her go third because there is a superstition about third that nobody will write down. Dressing felt less like costume and more like polite cooperation between fabric and shoulder. The dress did not try to be a metaphor. The shoes remembered not to lie. The earpiece behaved like a small bird that had been tamed without cruelty. In the wings, Nova bounced in place because bodies are clever, and Lorna put three fingers on the white of the doorframe, which might have been a habit and might have been a prayer. Saj checked a watch that was never for time but for weather, legal, and doors.

The room, when she stepped into it, did the thing it had to or everything else would have been pointless. It gave itself over to listening. She could feel the audience’s weight the way you feel a cat decide to stay on your lap. Marta gave her that half-smile that says, We’ll go now, and then they went. The first line came out like it had been waiting all week to be allowed to be itself. It had kitchen in it and café in it and a boy with a skateboard in it and a woman with a bun who terrifies nonsense for sport. It had tea in it and tide, and the dog was somehow in the vowel without having to be thanked. The second line was a corridor she had built; she walked it with the familiarity you earn only by turning the same handle until it fits your palm. The chorus made a promise about here-ness that did not need to tell you where here was to be true.

Somewhere in the second verse she felt the thing that happens when a song stops being a song and starts being an address. It is not applause. It is not a noise. It is a shift in a breathing animal. People lean in. People stop preparing a reaction. People take a word home to test it against their own cupboards. The bridge—really a low arch, because that is how she builds them—was the place where most people would have wanted a bit of shout. She lowered instead. She gave the room a soft thing and asked it not to drop it, and it didn’t. In the last chorus, when someone less stubborn would have lifted a key to tell the room how to feel, she kept hers and let the melody do the lifting, and the relief in the audience was a heat you could have used for bread.

When she finished, there was applause like rain on a tin roof: steady, enveloping, homely. The judges said their words, which this time were mostly words that meant “we saw you” and “we will pretend we allowed this in case anyone asks us later whose idea it was.” The host asked if this was about anyone and she said, looking at the audience and then at the camera as if it were a gull who had done its homework, “It’s about a kitchen, and a town, and a day where you remember you promised something to yourself and keep it,” and he blinked, and nodded, and moved on because a live show is a river with stones you can’t sit on for too long.

Backstage, Dan put his hands on her shoulders the way a builder checks a wall that isn’t going anywhere and said, “You did the thing,” which for a man who thinks adjectives are spare parts, not decorations, was an ovation. Marta grinned and put her guitar down gently as if it were a child who had finally fallen asleep. Nova cried for the precise amount of time that counts as hydration and then stopped as if on a timer. Lorna texted someone a single exclamation mark and then hid her phone under a folder as if the exclamation mark were confidential. Saj’s eyes went glassy for a second, which means only that she had removed her armour to oil it.

In Eastbourne, under a sky that had run out of adjectives, Len took his hat off and put it back on without needing a reason. The terrier sat up when the chorus came and then lay down again when it realized that singing does not always lead to tarts. Mrs. Pike said, “She can come back and do the sugar,” as if the matter had been under debate at a council level. Jai filmed the bell as it announced a woman with a wet scarf and edited text over it that read: When your friend makes the air behave, and then served two hot chocolates to teenagers shaking for reasons that had nothing to do with cold.

In the results, the floor remembered how to tilt. Names did the thing names do when they become heavy and end up on other people’s tongues. There is a way a person fails to move under telling and a way a person dances without leaving the spot they’re standing on, and she had learned both by now. Her name was called when it should have been, which is to say not so early it courted hate and not so late it looked like a miracle. Nova got through because the nation is not, after all, entirely opposed to trousers. A girl with a throat like a cathedral did not, and cried generously and still looked like a woman and not a wound. Someone made a speech about journeys that was not unbearable. People were human, and then they went to bed.

After the show, the vans waited like patient sharks and Saj steered her into a door that led to a corridor that led to a lift that led to a hallway that did not have carpet that forgave everything, only most things. On the bed in her room lay an envelope with her name in that same careful pre-keyboard hand. It had domed a little with rain and then dried and kept its dignity. Inside was a letter, simple and small. Not five words. Not two. Enough to make a day reorder itself by an inch. It said, “I won’t come to your work. I am proud elsewhere. I will write, not turn up. I can be not a hole. I can be a coat on a peg. If you want.” It had a phone number at the bottom and a name that had once been a word you could bruise your mouth on if you said it at the wrong time. She put the paper down because her hands had decided to stop. She made tea because kettles had been invented for this exact reason. She stood at the window and watched the city do late-night and early shift and resolve nothing at all.

She didn’t answer. She wrote nothing. She put the letter under the recipe card like adults do when they are trying to be their most intelligent selves and leave decisions until after sleep. She texted her mother a sentence composed entirely of verbs without subject or object and received, three minutes later, a photograph of a spoon and a heart and a door. Len sent nothing, which was a kindness so precise it might have been a surgical instrument. She took pins out of her hair and laid them in a pattern that looked like a boat if you wanted it to and a hedgehog if you didn’t. She washed the brave off and found the other kind underneath. She went to bed and let the room be a room, not a machine.

In the middle of the night the storm came back like a forgotten appointment and rattled the glass with professional gusto. Somewhere a siren found a road and performed purpose. In her dream she was on the pier in weather that couldn’t decide and the fairy lights had elected a leader. She was holding a tart and the dog was giving her advice in a language made mostly of blinking. The sea came in and went out and in again because that is all it knows and all it needs to know. When she woke, there was the sound of the city taking a breath, and for a moment she did not think of cameras or papers or men with shirts that mean meetings. She thought of a spoon drawer and a note that had been waiting to be let out and the exact weight of a mug in her hand, and she said out loud, to the ceiling that had listened to hundreds of people being brave in their sleep, “I am here,” not loud, not for the record, just to remind her mouth how to say it.

Morning arrived without asking and brought with it decisions shaped like cups. Lorna appeared with news about a theme that would not be obeyed. Dan arrived with a piano under his arm, figuratively, ready to argue with a key. Saj arrived with doors, as usual, with a look that said, Pack your coat and your no and your yes in that order. Nova arrived with a face that had made peace with trousers. Executive arrived with a new arrow for the whiteboard and the gull now had a scarf. The hotel had run out of the good jam. The city remembered how to be kind. The week had turned into a staircase and she put her foot on the next step, which is the only intelligent thing to do with stairs. The sea out there kept doing sea, and Eastbourne kept being a town with a bell and a lemon wall and a dog who had accidentally become national morale, and if the story had decided to be a story, well, she would keep the bones and lend the skin and make sure the song went where it needed to go.
