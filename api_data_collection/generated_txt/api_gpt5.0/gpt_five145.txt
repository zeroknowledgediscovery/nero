On mornings when the wind came in from the bay, Stafford could smell salt on the roofs. It got into the gutters and lodged in the roughness of Colorbond and tiled ridges alike. The van rattled and sang when he turned off Ryrie Street, and the ladder on top made a cluck at every pothole. He drove with one hand at seven o'clock on the wheel, eyes flicking between the traffic and the sky because he liked to time the light with the next job. You want to be where you’re going before the day fully commits to being day. That was something his father used to say, and Stafford kept it without remembering when it started to be his.

He was thirty-two and sometimes fifty, depending on who asked. He had a license for everything that mattered—construction wiring, testing and tagging, the endless thick book of rules with their thin and severe tone. The code felt like a schoolmaster you could never quite please, the kind that drummed its fingers on your desk while you tried to show you knew the difference between earth and neutral. He had never loved school, but he loved electricity because there was nothing abstract about it. You could see what it did to a bulb or a kettle, and once you touched the wrong thing you never forgot again.

Geelong lay in a lazy spread around him, industrial and handsome. Corio Bay glinted like a pocketknife blade. There were mornings when the smell of malt from the brewery sat on top of everything. There were nights when you could hear the footy ground breathing. He could be sent anywhere: Belmont’s cottages with their neat hedges and tired switchboards, Newcomb’s younger brick boxes with suspiciously cheerful fluorescent fittings, the weatherboard myths in Newtown whose attics kept a hundred years of dust and mouse bones and old sailors’ postcards. A call, a brief problem to be converted into parts and labor and the minor heroism of fixing what had been broken.

His mother had moved down the Bellarine to Clifton Springs after his father died. She called every Sunday and asked if he was eating. He was, mostly. The unit in Belmont had a small back yard that he kept promising to plant out and instead filled with offcuts of conduit and cable reels. In winter the wind crept under his skin. In summer he kept the windows open and learned the voices of the neighborhood—dogs, someone playing trumpet two houses down, a woman singing to herself in the laundry late at night, a chorus of magpies in the morning but always one, one that sat on the lemon tree and lectured him like it had questions about his choices.

He was not lonely. Or he was, depending. He liked his own company because he could arrange and reorder his memories in his head. He told himself stories. When he pulled into Mrs. Pellerin’s court in Newtown for a job to “fix that blinking light,” he found himself narrating an imagined version of himself to an invisible listener. It was a habit, old and private. I got here early, he said, because this old dear is going to have a surprise. The surprise of light. He smiled and then had to immediately put that smile somewhere that wasn’t visible when she opened the door.

“Stafford?” she asked through the flyscreen, as if there could have been any other man in his van with his name all over it. Her hair was white and staticky, and she had enormous glasses that made her eyes like deep sea fish eyes.

“That’s me,” he said, and then laughed because of course it was.

“You’re going to sort out the kitchen? It stutters. Drive me batty.”

He wiped his boots on her mat because he liked doing things that told another person: I thought about you. He looked at her light fitting and her old switchboard, and he went out to the van twice for parts because he hadn’t planned for the ceramic fuses and fabric-insulated wires. He fixed it. He showed her the new safety switch and told her why it was better. She made him tea. They talked about the weather and the cats next door and the way she could smell the sea on some mornings. He left with the taste of PG Tips and the memory of her hand on his forearm, brief and grateful, both of them pretending it was nothing.

Afterwards he parked on Pakington Street and leaned his head against the headrest. The day was unusually clear and the air had the scrubbed look it got after a storm. The bakery had their door open and the smell of warm butter poured out of it and into the street. He watched two schoolkids on bikes ride past, letting their wheels clack against the flaps on their mudguards. His phone buzzed.

“Mate, you got lunch?” Ned asked. Ned had once been a plasterer, then a handyman, then something he liked to describe as a “problem-solver,” which seemed to mean he did many things slowly and charged reasonably for the parts that worked.

“I can do. Complicated morning. Fabric cable—”

“Gross. Meet at the corner near the weird barber? Twelve-thirty.”

Stafford said okay, and then he didn’t go. He stayed another twenty minutes staring at the notice pinned to the community board in the café window. Grid-Connect PV Design and Install, it said in dull letters. Night classes. Accredited. Hands-on. There was a number, and there was the name of the teaching organization, and then, smaller, a woman’s name. Isobel Hart.

He took a photo and he felt a little jolt that was partly ambition and partly hunger. Solar was where the future and the money seemed to be. He liked roofs. He liked the idea of doing something new. He liked, although he was careful not to look it too squarely, the name of that instructor, which had a sound like tapping a knife against a water glass to ask for attention.

When the class started two weeks later he sat third row from the front because he had never been a front row person and he did not want to be a back row person. He sat there with a new notebook and wrapped around himself the feeling of being a student again, which did something very peculiar to his stomach. The room smelled like whiteboard markers and stale coffee. Sixteen adults slid into seats and did the half-smiles you do when you haven’t yet decided whether the other people in the room are your allies.

She walked in exactly at six. She wore a charcoal jacket that made her look like a stack of neat lines, and she had hair the color of wet bark and a face that was both ordinary and exquisite, the way a lamppost can be if you pay a certain kind of attention to it. She put down her bag and started talking in a low, competent voice without the breathy jokes of a person who thinks they need to charm in order to be listened to.

“I’m Isobel,” she said. “You can call me Isobel or Iz. I’m your main instructor for the next six weeks. We’ll be covering the design, installation, and safety of grid-connect PV systems. I know you’ve all read the prerequisite document. We will talk about AS/NZS 3000, 5033, and 4777. We will talk about conduit bending and stringing and why cable derating is not just a concept someone invented to annoy you. I like questions. I like argument. Leave with the confidence to say to a client, ‘I can do that and it will be safe and legal and the right thing for your roof.’ Also, the coffee machine in the hallway is broken, so there’s a kettle and instant at the back. I’m sorry. I’m also sorry that the lights in here buzz like a swarm in summer. You can’t fix everything in one night.”

He watched her hands as she arranged laminated diagrams on the desk. Her fingers were long and naked—no rings. She had a cough then, small and contained, like a secret she didn’t intend to tell. It meant nothing. It meant everything that would come later, hanging like a raincloud at the edge of the paddock.

He wrote in his notebook and found himself writing down things he didn’t need to. The crook of her elbow, a particular way she made a “3” like a looped heart when she wrote up a standard. The way she said kilowatt-hour like a word she loved. He told himself to pay attention to the materials and he did, because he wanted to be good at this. At the break she stood near the door and he walked toward the kettle and then his feet kept going, like someone had tilted the floor.

“Loved the part about derating,” he said. His mouth had a mind of its own. “I mean, not loved. Appreciated. Sorry, I’m Stafford. I’m—ah—local.”

“Hi,” Isobel said, like she’d heard this sentence five thousand times. “You’re an electrician already?”

“Yeah. Ten years. Small jobs. Renovations. Bit of this, bit of that. Thought I’d bring the solar bit into the mix.”

“Good time for it,” she said. “Also, good idea to go at it the boring way first—this bit—so you don’t cook someone’s roof or gamble with DC isolation like a cowboy.”

He laughed. He told her about a job he’d done on a half-finished deck where he’d chased wall cavities that turned out to be nothing but possum nests. She told him about an assessment she’d marked where a man had argued that the sun over the southern hemisphere wasn’t really that different. He said he liked her jacket and then immediately said, “That came out wrong. I should just go make coffee.”

“It’s fine,” she said, and her smile was not unkind. “I have a jacket. That is a true fact. There’s milk in the fridge that says ‘staff’, but it’s a lie. Anyone can use it.”

He poured coffee that tasted like burnt toast and they drank it at opposite ends of the same plastic table. He watched her move through the room like someone threading a needle through cloth. He saw other people speak to her; he watched her listen. He liked her lines. He liked that she could say kilovolt and still look like a person you might see at the market buying strawberries and arguing about the relative merits of punnets.

He lay in bed that night with the ceiling fan on low and the window cracked to let in the night air from Belmont. His neighbor had a television too loud, and in between the laughter and the punchlines he ran the scene back and forth. He imagined other versions—bold Stafford who said the right thing; shy Stafford who held back and wrote her a letter instead; disruptive Stafford who argued about a clause in 5033 and made her eyes flash. He thought of her cough, a minor thing, and his mind gave him a spasm of tenderness towards it, towards anything that made a person mortal and therefore capable of loving you back.

He told no one. He didn’t even tell Ned. He went to work and told himself that this was a story he could tuck into his pocket like a pen. In the attic of a house on Aberdeen Street, he belly-crawled over trusses while a fat huntsman spider watched him from the beam. He picked splinters out of his hands and said “sorry” to the insulation because it always got everywhere. At a café job on Moorabool Road he installed a 3-phase circuit for an espresso machine the size of a small car and made small talk with the barista, who said, “There’s a new class at night. I saw you at the kettle. You’re in that, yeah?”

“Yep,” he said, too quickly. “Solar.”

“The teacher’s got good hair,” she said, conspiratorial.

“It’s not about hair,” he said, but perhaps it was. It was about the way hair is ordinary and also not.

His mother asked him on Sunday if he’d met anyone nice. He cut her lawn with her old mower, which rattled like every car he and his father had ever owned. “I’m busy,” he said. “Nights. Course.”

“That’s good,” she replied. “Keep your brain open. Your father would be proud.”

He wanted that to be true with a tight desire that made him walk fast after taking the green bin to the curb. His father had been a quiet man who hated uncoiled hoses. Stafford still put them away in loops with that same precise twist. His father had not had the chance to see solar as anything other than an odd idea rich people put on their roofs. Stafford imagined showing him a system—arrays tilted like a stadium of blackbirds, rails and clamps and tidy string runs. He imagined his father’s hand, dry and warm, patting his shoulder in approval. He told himself this story all the way to Geelong West Library, where he returned a book he had not read.

The second week of the class, the air was brittle with a cold that arrived early and decided to stay. Isobel’s cough was a little worse, which he pretended not to hear. She had a thermos of something on the desk and she drank from it like someone taking small sips of the ocean. She introduced them to the lovely boredom of spreadsheets. She drew a miniature house on the board with a slanting roof and a lemon tree, and he wanted to tell her that he had a lemon tree that was also a magpie’s soapbox. He didn’t say it.

During a practical session he found himself close enough to read the writing on the label at the back of her watch. It was scratched and said E.H., which meant nothing, or it was a hand-me-down. His mind took that and made a life around it, a story about a sister, a father with a toolbox, a graduation night. The class wired mock panels with labelled, gentle joints under her supervision, and he found his hands steadier than they had been in weeks. When you like the person watching, your fingers learn a patience that you couldn’t manage for yourself.

“Clean,” she said, looking at his work. “Simple. Not everyone can do simple.”

“I’ll take that,” he said. “I could put it on my business cards. Stafford: Simple.”

“Careful,” she replied, but she had that glimmer in her eyes that said she knew she was being light, and she wanted to be, just then, with him, in that moment. He wrote it down in his head as if he could put it in a box under the bed and take it out in a different life.

After class they walked out into a wind that was brutish and mean. The lamplight on the car park glittered on puddles and put shadows under people’s feet. He saw her look at her phone and his brain did the stupid geometry of timing that would mean they arrived at their cars at the same time. He took a breath. He said, “Hey, if you’re ever—" and then he misunderstood his own sentence and had to restart it. “If you need someone to look at—ah, if the lighting in your rental is—no, I should not assume you’re renting, sorry, just—if you need anything electrical, I mean, I do, it’s what I do.”

“Thank you,” she said. “I have a lamp that doesn’t turn on except when it wants to. I suspect it’s the switch, but I keep meaning to take it apart and then thinking, ‘What if this is the night that I set the house on fire and then I sleep through it?’”

“I can look,” he said, too quick. “I can do it in five minutes.”

“Not now,” she said, not unkindly. “Tomorrow maybe. I have to get on the ring road tonight, I left too late for common sense already.”

She coughed then, and he leaned, just an inch, like people do when they want and do not want at the same time. He said, “Drive safe. There’ll be wombats.”

“There are no wombats on the ring road,” she said. “That’s not their vibe.”

“I know,” he said. “It was a joke that forgot how to be one.”

He watched her walk to a small hatchback with a pile of rolled-up posters in the back. Her brake lights made two red moons on the wet asphalt.

He told himself it was nothing. He told himself it was everything.

When she did message the next day, he read it ten times before he answered because he wanted his words to make the exact shape of what he needed them to be: helpful and casual and too busy to be weird. She sent him an address in Highton and said she’d be home after seven. He arrived at six-fifty and waited in the van, then got out and walked past her hedge and pretended to admire the roses so he would not look like he had come early to be the kind of person she might want to be late for. He knocked at precisely the time the clock on his dashboard ticked to.

“Hi,” she said, and moved aside, and the house smelled like paper and oranges. There were books in neat stacks and a bicycle in the corner. Her lamp was old, lovely, an art deco remnant that had been made when nothing was rushed. He opened it, a few smooth motions, and yes, it was the switch. He replaced it with one he had in his van because he liked to be the kind of person who could be relied on to carry around everything you might need before you even knew you needed it.

“Thank you,” she said, then coughed into her elbow in the way of someone disciplined. “You won’t let me pay you, will you?”

“Not for a switch like that.”

“You have too many powers,” she said. “Electric men. You come into a room and make it work.”

He wanted to say, I have exactly one power and it has nothing to do with walls and wires. He wanted to say, You are leaning against your kitchen bench like you live in a movie about a woman who took two steps sideways from the life she’d been expecting. He wanted to say, Do you like the sea? Do you think about leaving? Do you have parents who ask if you’re eating? He said, instead, “How’s the cough?”

“Fine,” she said. “Glamorous, really. There’s nothing more attractive than a respiratory virus in June.”

“Rest,” he said, and as he said it he listened to the word leave his mouth and go stand in the room with them and he wanted to know if she would go stand next to it. She didn’t. He left. In his van, he put both hands on the steering wheel and made a noise that had no name.

Ned called him on Friday and said, “Come to the pub. There’s a bloke here argues like he knows about wiring and he needs you to show him the truth.”

“I’m ghosting,” Stafford said. “I’m done. Got an early one.”

“You’re getting boring,” Ned told him. “You’ll wake up at fifty with a nice collection of tidy switchboards and we’ll all be dead.”

He went home. He lies on the couch and fell asleep quickly and badly, in his work hoodie, with a YouTube video of a man describing a solar install in Perth talking him down into a half-dream where all the roofs pitched at perfect angles and all the clamps clicked like heartbeats.

The third week’s class fell on a night when the wind backed off and the sky decided to be soft. Isobel’s voice was huskier than it had been, and she mentioned, lightly, that she might have to miss a day later in the week. She wore a scarf like a kindness she’d offered herself. They did a case study on a heritage house in East Geelong where small changes mattered and he could feel her attention just behind his left shoulder while he drew a plan and wrote notes in pencil. He looked up and she was not standing there, and he had the sharp pressure in his chest he remembered from boyhood when someone took away the thing he had been about to look at.

At the end of class she didn’t linger. Her phone was lit in her hand before he could say anything. She disappeared, as if the night had a seam and she had slipped a hand into it. He drove aimlessly, ended up near Eastern Beach, parked by the bollards and watched the waves make their quiet arguments with the shore. He imagined telling her about this place, about the fog horns, about the way the carousel lights made stories with reflections on the bay. He imagined her laughing at him in the correct cruel way and then not cruel at all.

Once, in a weatherboard house, he hit his head so hard he saw stars. He lay on his back in the dust and called himself an idiot and then started to laugh, and the client, an old man with a cardigan, laughed with him. “You alright?” the man asked, and Stafford said yes, and then he thought: people are always asking the wrong question. Alright is not all there is. There is also this: the quiet, and the sweet ache behind a good thing you are not allowed.

The cough got worse. She sent an email saying there would be a substitute instructor on Thursday for the practical, a man named Ravi, who would be kind and take no nonsense. She signed it with just “I.” He saw that and wrote in his notebook, an I.

He saw her again the following week, paler but not diminished. “I’m fine,” she said to the room. “I took a flu in the nose and I lost, but I am fine. Wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and don’t lick the inverters. I am a poor example on at least two counts.”

They laughed. They followed her into a long night of voltage rise calculations. He made his columns even and counted his zeros carefully. He willed her not to cough and she coughed, and each time he felt something rise in him like a tide that wanted to take the chairs with it and it was ridiculous and it was not ridiculous.

At home he lay awake and tried to fit this new narrative into his old order. He had memories of him as a boy sitting on the cold metal of the grandstands at Kardinia Park with his dad, both of them wrapped in blue and white, but his mind insisted on tilting the memory until Isobel sat on one side of him with a scarf that wasn’t team colors but the same as her pulse, and Ned on the other side made commentary about the ref losing his glasses. He rewrote the world as it should be, which was not as it was.

He did not, in those nights, think of the fact that literature had taught him this trick and that it had a name. He did not think of the times he lied to himself as a kindness. He thought of the first time he’d wired a light switch in his father’s shed and his father had turned the light on and said nothing, just smiled. That was something true, something you could stand under. He thought of teaching that was like that. He thought of her because she was a cast of light in a room he had left too dark for too long.

On a Tuesday, the barista from Moorabool saw him and said, “Your teacher wasn’t at the market. She usually buys pears.”

“You know her?” he asked, too fast.

“She chats. She said she’d go up to Ballarat for a weekend to see snow. I told her it wasn’t really snow, just wet and rude. She laughed. Haven’t seen her since.”

Stafford filed this away. He put it on a mental shelf and didn’t know he would take it down later, and later again. He fixed a downlight in a drywall ceiling and replaced an RCD that tripped whenever a kettle thought about being a kettle. He threw his ladder on the van like a man in a film throwing his heart into a lake.

The fourth week he arrived early and the classroom was empty. He sat and listened to the building talk—ducts complaining, doors yawning. He was the kind of man who noticed that kind of noise. He liked to think he could hear current in the walls, a faint conversation the wires had with each other about purpose. The door opened and Ravi walked in with a box of clamps and a face that looked like it had been chiseled out of patience.

“Isobel’s not here,” he said, unnecessarily. “She’s off. Real flu, not the polite version. We’ll go on.”

Stafford found his muscles making two things at once: a shrug that said it didn’t matter and a flinch that said it did. He said, “Okay,” and tried to hand his attention over to the concept of earthing arrays and the little ritual of checking every bolt with the exact right amount of faith.

After class he waited. He didn’t know for what. He lingered at the back with other men who had children to go home to but had decided to put their coats on slowly. He texted Ned a single word—Beer?—and then put his phone back in his pocket because he knew he would not go, even if Ned said yes.

He drove to Eastern Beach again. The night was a shade darker. The water wore the wind and the wind wore the idea of him. He walked along the bollards and read the names of ships etched on them, low letters like signatures the city had left for itself in case it forgot. He took a breath and counted it, one two three; he had learned this technique somewhere, one of those articles someone had posted that promised ten ways to make your heart behave.

When he went home, he opened his notebook to the page where he had written her name and he wrote it again and then drew a line through each letter like it was a diagram and the line meant current.

There are stories about men like this and they do not end well. They end with foolishness or harm. He knew this because he was not an idiot. He did not stand outside her house with flowers. He did not write her letters. He put himself exactly where he had been and did not move, and he waited for the old organ music of time to rearrange him.

The next message came late and was not meant to be a message that took his breath, but it did. She wrote to the class list from a new email address: apologies for the delay, I went down while traveling and ended up in someone’s spare room coughing like a coal engine. Back next week if the universe allows. Wash hands etc. Please be kind to Ravi in the meantime. She signed it with her usual initial and a small, unnecessary word—cheers—that he took like sunrise.

He told himself he would say nothing when she returned. He rehearsed saying nothing. He practiced a face that was a room with drapes drawn back for light but not too far. On the night he saw her again, she had a slightly different weight, as if the flu had knocked a piece of her out and the air had not yet filled it. She called herself stupid for traveling. She told them someone in a town he didn’t catch the name of had put her up, strangers who loved to make soup. He saw how the rest of the class smiled at the image of her being looked after and he hated them and loved them. He wanted to say, I would have made soup. He wanted to say, I would have made you the worst soup and you would have praised it for the effort and then quietly thrown it away when I wasn’t looking.

She caught his eye as if she’d heard that inside him. Or maybe she was catching someone else’s entirely different eye and his mind had built scaffolding around it so that her gaze could only land on him. He did not know. He wasn’t sure about the shape of the room anymore. The whiteboards looked farther away and then very close.

When the class finished he walked out and the wind was soft again, and he heard someone behind him say, “Stafford,” and he turned as if the world had called him by his original name. It was her. Of course it was her. She had her coat around her like a gift she had just received.

“Hello,” he said, because he could not remember any other word.

“The lamp is still working,” she said. “This is a miracle.”

“Electricity is ninety percent luck,” he said. “Don’t tell my insurers.”

“You could make a church out of the way you talk about it.”

He laughed, then, and something opened between them like a tiny door you could only see if you were the right height and the right distance away. She looked tired. He had to stop himself from reaching out and smoothing the air in front of her shoulder.

“You shouldn’t be here if you’re still sick,” he said. “The night air’s—"

“I’m not a plant,” she said, and then softer, “I’m fine. And if I wasn’t, I couldn’t stay inside another night. The spare-room people kept feeding me, and they were kind, but I felt like I’d become a piece of furniture with a cough. This is better.”

“The spare-room people?”

“I’ll tell you one day,” she said, and even that was enough to build a cathedral in his mind. “Strangers can rescue you and it’s both perfect and slightly humiliating.”

“Was it Ballarat?” he asked, because he had the barista’s story in his pocket.

“Ballan,” she said. “Close enough. You should see their lemon tree.”

“I have one,” he said.

“Good. We’ll compare.”

She walked away then, because you always have to. He watched her until the dark took the exact outline of her body and smoothed it into a general suggestion. He put his hands in his pockets and made his fingers hold onto his keys like they were instructions. He went home.

In bed, the ceiling fan made its slow arguments with the heat. He lay on his back and the whole day repeated, but it was not a record that found the groove each time; it skipped, restarted, jumped, smooth then halting, then, suddenly, clear. He told himself, one day I will wake into the life where we are already talking and we have been talking for years, and there will be in-jokes and kitchen drawers with the wrong things in them because we both keep putting them in the wrong place and then saying it’s your fault no it’s yours. He told himself one day I will not have to do this in my head, my throat won’t have this tightness like someone’s braided it with fishing line. And he suspected, even then, that his telling was the thing itself. That the story was the scaffold, and the house had never required walls. That he had, for as long as he had been alive and able, lived inside rooms he had constructed out of careful sentences, as if the right arrangement of words could turn air into skin.

His alarm went in the morning at six-fifteen. He got up. He made toast. He checked the van. He wrote down the jobs for the day on a scrap of paper that he stuck under the visor with a band of lost elastic. He drove into another Geelong morning where the wind coming off the bay had a new smell—steel, woodsmoke, the world breathing in and out like someone asleep on the couch under a blanket that had belonged to their mother.

He was an electrician. He cut through ceilings and made things. He knew wires by touch and screws by taste. He had a teacher with a cough and a scarf and a lamp he had fixed. The story lay against him like another shirt under his shirt, and he wore it into the day. He had no reason to believe that anything was unusual. There was just this for now: a class on Thursday, a list of clients, a lemon tree talking magpie talk and the van’s ladder clucking a little at every bump in the road, and a name in his notebook that did not yet know what it meant.The week leaned forward and Stafford leaned with it, the way you tilt your body as if to encourage a car up a hill. Morning came through his blinds like a thin admission that the dark was over, and the lemon tree outside gave a small brave shake that put two glossy leaves on the pavers. He ate toast over the sink because crumbs were easier to route to the drain than the floor, and he laid tools on the bench in an order his father would have approved of: meter, cutters, drivers, labels. The van’s door rolled shut with the soft thunder it always made, and when he turned the key the radio gave him a burst of news about a politician apologizing for not apologizing. He switched it off and let the engine talk. The streets were still clearing their throats. Dogs inspected gutters and men in hoodies carried takeaway coffees like offerings. He liked being on the road when other people were still remembering their names.

His first job sent him north, past the silos with their concrete gravity and into a pocket of warehouses where forklifts had right of way and gulls strutted like dockside policemen. The air tasted faintly like malt and diesel, a mix he had catalogued as Tuesday Industrial. Inside, the floor manager was a woman in a hi-vis vest with a voice that suggested a long relationship with radios. “RCD’s been tripping every time we run the band saws,” she said. “We get a run of cuts going and it decides we’ve sinned.” He nodded and shook hands because it was important to touch people’s palms and say their names back to them, as if you were pinning them to this morning. He ran tests, watched the numbers blink, opened a panel that had last been labeled in a different handwriting. He chased a neutral fault through a junction that had been done in a hurry five years ago by someone who’d been thinking about lunch. He tightened something that had wanted attention. He replaced something that would have failed tomorrow and told her today was luck, not foresight, and she looked at him with the tired gratitude of a person in charge of machines that must not stop. When he reset everything and the saws sang, she exhaled like a balloon that had been under a chair for a week. “Invoice me hard,” she said. “We’ll forgive you.”

On the roof a tired solar array lay flat, the modules dull as old coins, pigeons having expressed opinions in white. He squinted up at it, not his job and therefore particularly tempting. At smoko, he asked one of the guys if anyone ever checked it. “Salesman said it paid itself off in seven years,” the guy answered, drinking tea from a travel mug that said WORLD’S OKAYEST DAD. “That was eight years ago. So I suppose it’s all profit now, unless profit looks like that.” He wanted to climb the ladder and look at the isolators for the pure pleasure of seeing where decisions had been made, but you don’t just visit a roof without being asked. He folded the itch and put it in his pocket like a receipt.

Between jobs his phone buzzed with a message from the training organization that wore Isobel’s voice even if her name wasn’t on it. Thursday’s practical will be on mock roofs out the back if the rain behaves. Bring gloves and a willingness to argue about rail spacing until we all agree. He typed back a sensible reply that included the words looking forward, and he deleted the first draft that had said, warmly, I will bring the right gloves and the right arguments. The second felt like a man who understood where a line sat and respected it. He hit send and then held the phone while he drove, thumb against its edge, as if contact would make the message multiply into the future.

Ned called him to an emergency that wasn’t; a cupboard door had divorced itself from its hinges and, in leaving, had exposed a nest of wires in a rental that had been decorated in a style called early two-thousand-and-oh-no. “They’ve had a man,” Ned said by way of greeting. “The man was cheap. The man did not like junction boxes. The man liked tape.” Stafford could have refused, because his day had already been shaped, but he liked the way Ned framed the world. He went. He found the tape, enough to start a ball you could roll downhill and announce as an art project. He made the mess into a drawing you could approve, the kind of order a future electrician might swear at a little and then nod for. The tenant was a nurse with the pale trench of tired under her eyes, and she kept saying thank you as if she were apologizing for the way the cupboard had betrayed her. “We could all keep a better eye on our cupboards,” Ned said grandly, as if performing for a small theater that existed only in his head. Outside, standing by their vehicles, Ned nudged him with an elbow. “You’ve been weird,” he said. “Weirder than your usual niche. You’re not dying, are you? If you are, I want the van.” Stafford laughed and said he was taking a night class, which in the taxonomy of things you can tell a man like Ned ranked somewhere between news and the possibility of a new kind of sandwich. “Solar,” he said, and Ned did the face men do when they’re pretending they thought you were already that kind of person. “About time,” Ned replied. “You’ve got the way of someone who knows where the sun is.”

Sunday came wrapped in light that had warmed itself on the water. Stafford drove down to Clifton Springs with a bag of oranges and a set of blades for the mower because if he didn’t bring the blades he would say he should. His mother had a list that started with small things and ended with a sentence she didn’t say out loud. The kitchen was the same shape it had been when he was twelve, the clock over the stove stuck at 2:14 and going on quietly, committees of magnets on the fridge arguing about holidays they had been printed to advertise. “You look tired,” she said, because it was her way of saying I see you, and he told her that tired was just his face now and that people who sell sleep supplements would go out of business if everyone accepted the truth. After he edged and emptied and pulled weeds that came out like bad habits, she gave him a plastic crate that had been his father’s and that he had somehow never been ready to take. “I found it behind the fishing rods,” she said. “It’s time.” Inside were a test lamp with its cord wound in the exact way his father had taught him to wind things that wanted to tangle, a bag of lugs in a tin that had once held toffees, and a notebook with the first page full of a list written in that careful masculine script school used to require. The list was of jobs completed and the dates they had been done. Between them had been notes that didn’t concern electricity at all. Wednesday rained all day. Good tomatoes this year. Your mother’s birthday next week. He ran his finger under the words as if he could find the warmth there. At the back of the book, a clipped recipe for pumpkin soup fell out and landed on his shoes. “He kept promising to make that,” his mother said, and then patted the back of his head as if he were still within reach of the height that had fit under her hand. “He made everything else.”

The training center’s yard on Thursday was a choir of Colorbond roofs pitched on frames like large toys. The air had the sharpness of aluminum and cut grass. Isobel was back with a clipboard and a scarf that looked like it knew the geometry of her neck. She divided them efficiently into groups like a magician revealing that the deck had always been in four suits. “We’re going to treat these like three different houses and one grumpy shed,” she said. “You’ll work through layout, rail spacing, fixings, earthing, and neatness. We will talk about what to do when you are two metres from the ridge and your plan meets the reality of a previous builder who thought rafters were a suggestion. Safety first, second, and third. Fourth is making it look like you meant to do it.”

He found himself with a plumber who had decided he liked electrons better than water now and a woman from Colac who ran a farm and had the forearms of someone who could talk to a bull and win. They measured and clicked, chalk lines on steel, the satisfying repetitive work of placing clamps so they were not fighting and rails so they sat like ideas that had agreed. Isobel moved through the groups with that low, clean voice. When she came to him, he made his body still as if stillness could attract approval. “Show me the path of your cabling,” she said, and he did, with his hands, describing a route that avoided hot roof and tight bends and the stupid urge some people had to strap the future to the wrong thing. “Good,” she said. “Listen to your fingers. They like right angles because they feel like decisions.” When the farmer woman clicked a plug that hadn’t fully clicked, there was that small not-sound that tells you something is nearly correct but not quite the shape of correct. Isobel reached over, placed the connectors in her hands and said, “Listen for the bit that sounds like someone agreeing with you,” and demonstrated, and the click came, small and pure. “Those are the clicks you remember when you wake up at three,” she added. “Regret doesn’t click.”

At the break he found himself near the kettle again, pouring something brown into a mug that had a chip he rotated to the inside. Isobel stood near the roller door letting the winter sun sit on her face like a coin. She coughed, discreet and tired, and he wanted to donate a lung like a man in a fairy tale who barters organs in exchange for time. He approached because people were already talking to her and he could blend into the group. Someone asked about rooftop isolators; someone else argued for and against their continued use and the house fire that had launched a thousand white papers. Isobel held the debate in her palms and set it down gently. “We install what the standard requires and what common sense would choose if the standard went home early,” she said. “We don’t add points of failure because we like plastic, and we don’t pick a hill to die on if the hill is covered in bad O-rings.” It was the kind of sentence that would have read like a joke if she had smiled, but she didn’t, and it landed as commandment. Stafford held onto it like a rung on a tall ladder.

They returned to the roofs and the day did that thing all good days do, where hours slip like bolts into pre-drilled holes. At the end, when the panels were down for storage again and the chalk had lost its edge and somebody had eaten all the good biscuits, Isobel called the group into a loose mess that resembled an audience on a documentary about laughing at work. “Take a photo of your rails before you go,” she said. “You’ll want to show someone who doesn’t care later. They will say ‘that looks straight’ and you will feel a religious feeling.” They laughed, and Stafford watched her put her clipboard under her arm and then look like she might put it down and look less like a person who always had something under her arm. He picked up a coil of earth wire because picking up things made his body useful. When he carried it past her, she stepped aside and said, “Your group’s was the neatest,” crisp and quiet, and he said, “I am deeply committed to neatness,” and he felt, absurdly, as if he had made a vow.

He drove home with dry dust on his knuckles and the pleasant fatigue of muscles that had been asked to do what they were for. The lemon tree magpie was back in its usual branch position as if it had a contract to fulfill. He stood under it and told it about how an installer in another group had insisted on putting clamps equidistant for the photograph rather than for the rafter. “Don’t do that,” he said up at the bird, and the bird tilted its head as if to say, I do not own clamps. He went inside and ate a weird dinner that had started as a plan and ended as an arrangement of components. He slept like someone who had slept before and remembered how.

A café neon on Ryrie spat itself into darkness somewhere between Tuesday and Wednesday, and the owner had called him because he liked the way Stafford didn’t make noises when he opened things. The sign’s transformer felt like an old man at the end of a dance. He made the change on a ladder while hipsters with backpacks watched him with the mild fascination you reserve for men who do things with their hands. On the way down he paused at the halfway rung and listened to the hum come back like a beehive remembering its purpose. The glow went out over the footpath and gave people’s faces a faint pink honesty. The barista with opinions on teachers gave him a free croissant because she said she couldn’t look at it another minute. “Your teacher was back,” she said. “She bought pears again.” He said he was glad to hear it with ridiculous formality, and she laughed at him like a friend’s sister would and he found that his shoulders had dropped a centimeter.

In the evenings he opened his father’s notebook and a new one of his own. He copied the tidy headings his father had used and then under them he wrote things his father would not have written, like inverter placement and cable run losses and a list of potential business names he would not tell anyone about. He wrote Simple in the margin and put a box around it and then made himself a little sick with the idea of selling himself as a brand. He registered a domain and then closed the tab before he could pay for it, because if you don’t finish a thing you can’t have failed at it yet. He drew a lemon tree and wrote next to it, because, just because, and then turned the page so he didn’t have to look at that sentence and wonder who he thought he was.

At class the wind went to ground and a fog came up from the river like a blanket someone had hung on a fence. They did content that had nothing romantic in it if you didn’t like the romance of details. They talked about voltage rise and conductor upsizing and when to split arrays to keep an inverter happy. Isobel was in her element, which looked like a neat rectangle on a whiteboard and a story about a job in Lara where the client had insisted their roof was perfect until it admitted, under a square and a tape, that it had ideas about straightness that were more flexible than a man would want. “The roof is the roof,” she said. “It’s not the one in your head.” He made a private sound at that and worried that someone had heard it. During the break he caught her alone in the little concrete wedge that served as a smoking area because no one smoked there anymore. She was leaning against a wall that had collected a decade of weather, and her breath puffed when she laughed because the night had teeth. He said something unheroic about the fog. She said, “Do you ever go into the bay when it’s like this?” and he said not unless he wanted to come out a different creature. She coughed and then added, “Someone in Ballan made me ginger tea every day for three days and I didn’t deserve them,” and he said, “You deserved them because you were coughing like a farm machine,” and it was a ridiculous thing to say and yet she didn’t punish him for it. “They were a married couple who collect people,” she said, and the way she said it made it sound like a benign hobby. “They keep a spare room for stray academics and salesmen. You should see how proud they are of their kettle. If you ever break down near there, stop and tell them your name. They’ll make you into soup.” He opened his mouth and then closed it because it felt like a trick to say I would like to be made into soup by your spare-room people, too.

On a Saturday, an email invited volunteers to a community install day in a suburb where the houses had been built in the seventies when people still trusted brown bricks and long windows. The project was a small charity’s effort to reduce the power bills of people who had more dignity than cash. He signed up because he had no reason not to, and because good work like that made his fingers feel like they were part of the body of the town. He turned up with his harness and his lunch and found three other students and a trainer who wasn’t Isobel, but she was there anyway, in jeans and boots, carrying a box of lag screws that looked like a shorthand for purpose. “I shouldn’t be climbing,” she said to no one and everyone. “I’ll stay on the ground and be unpleasant about tightening torques.” The house belonged to an older Greek couple whose front garden produced tomatoes like miracles. The man tried to pay in cucumbers immediately and the woman said to him in Greek the equivalent of not yet, show restraint, we are not wolves. Stafford carried rails and laughed when he should have and listened to the trainer crack jokes about rafter hunting. He watched Isobel stand with a clipboard and draw on the air while she explained cable management, and he thought of puppeteers and conductors and people who teach a dog to sit with only their hands.

At midday they sat on the curb with their PB&Js and their salami and the cucumbers, which arrived in a plastic bag with a vanished supermarket name. The old man brought lemon wedges and salt in a saucer and told them to make the cucumbers into something beautiful. Isobel sat next to Stafford not because she meant to but because that’s how the geometry worked out. “Did you know how to do any of this as a kid?” she asked through a mouthful of bread. “This being the general making of things go.” He said he’d spent afternoons in his father’s shed winding extension leads into the shape of disciplined snakes. She said her father had been a school principal who had not owned pliers and had once asked if a Phillips head would work on a star screw and she had told him the star was a person and he didn’t have a visa. “He had a beautiful way with essays,” she added. “He wrote comments that made you want to be brighter.” He nodded and didn’t say, and what about your watch with the letters, and who gave it to you and did they make you soup when you were sick and would they mind if you never saw them again. He said, “My dad couldn’t look at a coiled hose without trying to fix it with a look,” and she said, “Some men do that,” and then she lifted her head and coughed, and after the cough she inhaled like someone who had remembered an important detail.

After lunch, he was on the roof with another student who had a laugh that made the ladder shake. They set the last rail, checked level, checked for straight, checked that their fixings had found timber and not dream. When they clicked the last clamp into place, the click sounded like a coin dropped into a jar labeled future. The inverter went onto a board in the carport with the neatness of an apology made on time. The couple stood with them when the system came alive like a quiet animal and the old woman cried in a way that made Stafford look at his shoes. “Light is cheaper now,” she said. Isobel coughed and then took a photograph not of the panels but of the couple’s hands, because she was that kind of person.

On the drive home he sang along to the radio in a voice that didn’t trouble itself with quality, and at a red light he saw in the next lane a dog with its head out the window and its mouth open to the joy of small currents. He thought of texting Ned a photograph of the installed array and then didn’t, because he wanted to sit with it alone for a while. At home he poured hot water over a teabag and watched the tea turn the way the bay turns at certain sunsets, a brown that pretends to be gold. He took his father’s notebook out of the crate and wrote at the bottom of a page the date and a line that said fitted panels for people who needed a break. He wrote it in his father’s neat script because he could get close to it when he concentrated, and then he looked at it and decided to leave it there so that when he read back later he would not be embarrassed by his own heart.

Work, class, work again. The rhythm repeated without being a loop that bored him. He went up and down ladders and came back with his knees talking to him. He learned to enjoy the way a conduit run looks when it stops pretending it’s art and admits it’s a path. He had a client in Newtown who insisted on telling him about every man who had ever drilled a hole in her house, and he listened because everyone’s story is also the story of the place you are in. He had a man in a high-rise on the waterfront who did not understand why some switches stay on and others stay off when you turn off the breaker, and he explained it with pictures in the air and left behind a small sketch that the man would fold into a wallet and forget.

One evening, late and with the air tasting like someone had ironed it, his phone buzzed with a message from Isobel. It was a practical note about a change in the next class’s timing because of a room booking. Beneath it, almost as if her thumb had slipped and then decided to pretend it had meant to, there was a sentence. The lamp still works. He stared at it like it was a small creature that might run if he moved. He typed back a factual reply about the class, and then a second sentence about the lamp that said, blandly, good to know, and then he deleted the word good and typed glad instead. He sent it. He put the phone down and counted to eight and picked it up and put it down again because your hands must have something to do in those moments or they invent trouble.

He began dreaming about roofs. In the dreams, they were endless, linked like fields, and he walked across them with a bag of clamps that never ran out. In the distance there was a figure that he knew was his father or Isobel depending on where the dream needed him, and he didn’t run to catch up because it was enough to walk and know the figure was there. In the morning he woke with a feeling like he had been working all night and he wasn’t tired. He made toast and burned it and ate it anyway because charcoal has its place.

He saw his mother again and told her he was taking a test in three weeks. “I’m proud already,” she said in the voice she saved for days when she remembered loneliness and decided not to make it everyone else’s problem. “I won’t pretend to understand what you do when you look at those little boxes, but I know you look at them with the face your father used on tomatoes.” He said he hoped to pass and she said, “You will,” and then added, “And if you don’t, you’ll pass the time after that,” and he thought that might be the wisest sentence anyone could say into any room.

At class, a man asked a stupid question that wasn’t stupid because it was the kind that unhooks other quiet questions out of other people’s mouths. Isobel respected the question by setting it down on the table and turning it over so everyone could see all sides. Her cough rose less often and she didn’t apologize for it when it did, and he noticed that the room’s wiring buzzed a little less when she was in good voice, although of course it didn’t, although of course it did. Afterward, he found her in the hallway packing cords into loops that would please anyone who respected circles. He said, lightly, that he had been thinking of painting his van because apparently that is what you do when you want to look like you have grown up. She said, equally light, that if he chose a color like forest, he would make every driveway in Geelong look like it was being visited by a ranger. He said he might choose a gray that hid dirt and advertised nothing. She said, “Nothing isn’t as invisible as you think,” and then someone else came and required her attention, and he walked away with that sentence in his pocket like a stone.

On a day of rain that tried hard and then gave up, he went to the library and returned the book he still hadn’t read and borrowed another one he wouldn’t. He sat near the window where the light watched itself in the glass and studied a series of sample questions that knew how to trick a person who thought they couldn’t be tricked. He penciled answers and rubbed them out. He thought of the older Greek woman putting salt on the cucumbers and he thought of the old man’s hands touching the inverter as if it were a shrine. He wrote the word shrine and then crossed it out, because he would not be the man who wrote shrine about a box of electronics. He wrote box, solid box, helpful box, law-abiding box, and smiled at himself alone at a table while a child nearby built a tower from soft blocks and then knocked it down with professional glee.

On a Friday evening the sky went the color of metal and Pakington Street unrolled itself like ribbon. Ned texted him a photograph of a piece of plaster that had fallen onto a record player. Under it was a caption that read I fixed music. Stafford replied with a picture of a new RCD in a tidy row and wrote I fixed not dying, and Ned sent back a thumbs up and then a gif that somehow made the thumb into a chicken. These were the messages that held a week together, the small stitches.

He lay in bed that night and the house gave a sigh, the kind of tired breath that old wood takes. The magpie had gone to whatever tree magpies check into when the dark has weight. He thought of Isobel’s hands and the way she held a marker when she wrote a “3” like a looped heart. He thought of writing a line to her about Ballan and lemons and soup and the community install and the click that’s an agreement. He thought about posting a photograph of rails that ran true. He did none of these things. He put his hand flat on the bed beside him and felt the sheet, cotton and cool, and he decided he could live inside the kind of night that asks nothing and gives nothing away and yet leaves a person fuller than they had been when the sun lay down.

Week five came like a train that had learned to be quiet. The class had become a set of faces he could predict: the plumber who had betrayed water with a clear conscience, the farmer whose wrists were proof of weather, the bookish man who had chosen electricity because it didn’t require you to heal anything. They knew each other enough to make the kind of jokes that don’t wound. Isobel started the lesson with a story that had begun with a client asking for the impossible and ended with the impossible breaking in a predictable way that had still surprised the client. “You will meet men and women who have bought brochures,” she said. “They will show you the pictures like holiday planners and tell you they want the one with the happiest sky. It’s your task to bring the sky down into math and remind them that roofs live in the real.” He felt warmed by the idea that bringing the sky down could be someone’s job.

After class, when the night had done the trick where it pretends to be emptiness and is actually full of everything, she said his name like someone returning a borrowed thing. He didn’t trust his face not to tell the truth so he looked over her shoulder at a poster advertising forklift safety, which has never set anyone’s heart on fire. “I’m going to need someone to help me next month with an off-site assessment,” she said. “You’re careful and I need careful, not clever. It’s paid if that matters. It’s on a Thursday. You’ll have to tell me if you can afford to be away from your jobs.” He said yes quickly and then slower because haste looks like hunger if you arrange it badly. “I can afford careful,” he added, and she said, “Good,” and she coughed once like a punctuation mark. “It’s at a place with too many skylights,” she continued. “We’re going to try to keep everyone from falling through opinions.” He laughed because she wanted him to, and for once he did not replay the laughter later looking for flaws.

He woke the next morning into a life that had added one small promise, and he noticed that promises change the temperature of a room in the way a heater does when you curl its cord out and decide where to put it so it warms the right part of your shins. The lemon tree had one fruit half-yellow, the bird had been elsewhere. He ate toast and looked at the van and thought about paint, forest or nothing, ranger or ghost. He put his father’s notebook into the glovebox as if it could keep him company and he drove with his hand at seven on the wheel and his eyes flicking the light because it was a habit and because, for reasons he didn’t yet want to name, he wanted very much to be where he was going before the day fully committed to being day.By the time the sun pulled itself up over the You Yangs like a man lifting a heavy bag, the week had already decided it would be one of those that opened its mouth and sang. Stafford drove early to a job in Barwon Heads and the road took him past paddocks where horses leaned into hay as if their whole bodies were mouths. The river was a dark rope under the bridge and the smell was salt and eucalyptus and faint smoke, a stack of layers that would unwrap themselves as the day went on. He found himself taking a bend slower than he needed because the sky on his left had the exact blue of a shirt his father had worn to good things, and that thought slowed him more than any sign could. The job was a beach house masquerading as a shack, all natural timber left to silver and a deck that had convinced everyone who stood on it that they were the kind of person who would read novels in hammocks. Inside, the owner wanted power for a second fridge that would never hold anything more dangerous than sparkling water and four limes. He ran a new circuit, measured runs that refused his first neat idea and instead insisted on a compromise around a stubborn beam. He spoke to the man about RCDs and the man said yes and no and then tried to tell him about fishing at the Bluff and Stafford nodded because listening wasn’t time theft, it was tax, it paid back later in ways you couldn’t always track.

On the way home he stopped at a lookout and watched the water argue with itself. The wind came round from the south and pushed his jacket against him like a friend who wanted him to move along. He checked his phone, as if he expected it to jump through his hand, and there was a message from the training organization with the exactness of a tap measure: assessment off-site, Thursday week, safety focus, arrival seven-thirty, contact: I. He read it twice and then opened his calendar, which was a mess of jobs and notes that had evolved a gentleman’s agreement rather than a system, and he moved two smaller things and phoned a third to ask if they minded being Friday instead of Thursday. The woman answered with a sigh that was nurse-tired and he said he would come when she needed, and she said Friday was fine, and he carried the new plane of the week like a tray with a teapot on it, careful and pleased.

Back in Belmont, the lemon tree had moved through half-yellow to three-quarter and was holding there like someone about to say something. The magpie issued a comment that could have been about the weather or about his life, and he said to it, “I heard, mate,” and set about cleaning the van in a way he did when he wanted his nerves to eat something besides his stomach lining. He unrolled tape that had collected dust, he put drivers back into the slots they knew by feel, he found a bolt that had lurked under the passenger seat for probably a year and held it up to the light as if it could confess which job it had been meant for. His father’s notebook went from glovebox to kitchen bench and he added a line about the beach house and the difficult beam and the limes, because specificity pleased him. He flipped to the back and found the recipe again for pumpkin soup and then closed it, not ready to cut pumpkin into squares and stand over steam while thinking about men who had left rooms by staying in them.

The next class had the particular hum of people who had made a habit out of arrival. He found his chair like a homing pigeon finds a roof, and he put his notebook down beside a pen that had a bite mark near the cap that somehow wasn’t his. Isobel came in with two bags as if one day she had set down some weight and never fully picked it up again. The cough had shrunk and moved into a pocket of her chest like a lodger who was planning to leave. Her voice turned the room into a shape he recognized. They worked through communication protocols between inverters and meters, through CT clamps and wrong ways to put them on, through the gentle tyranny of DNSPs and their spirited views on export limits. He liked the way she drew little arrows that ran out of whiteboard space and onto the metal frame and then floated there as if the wall had become a river. When she asked someone to explain reactive power to the group, the plumber attempted bravely and then crouched under his own verb, and she stood next to him and gave him a hand back up with a sentence about how power sometimes arrives politely at the door and sometimes doesn’t, and your task is to manage both. He looked at the back of her wrist and saw the veins there like a line drawing of a place other people would call home.

At the break she found him by not looking for him, standing halfway between the urn and the roller door, and she spoke to him in the tone she used for asking people if they were going to argue with her or work with her. “You can be bad cop on harnesses?” she asked, and he said he could be any cop as long as it meant no one fell through a bad decision. She smiled with one side of her mouth and said, “That roof has those terrible old fibreglass skylights like bullies. We will dance around them like we’re wearing long skirts.” He imagined a roof of bullies and Isobel in a long skirt stepping past each of them without once letting them see her flinch. He told her he had a spare set of lanyards if the center ones were the wrong kind, and she said she trusted him to have exactly what would make her look more competent than she was. He laughed, and she leaned against the doorframe and coughed once, and it was so normal he felt dizzy.

Ned wanted him Tuesday night for a pub counter meal and an argument about whether plasterers should be allowed to buy laser levels in Bunnings. He went because if you only follow one thing in a week you lose shape. The parma arrived on a plate wider than a map, and the chips made their usual case for being the best and worst thing about being alive. Ned asked about the course and Stafford told him as much as you can tell someone about standards without sending them to sleep. “So you’re going to be one of the men on the roofs,” Ned said, chewing. “Waving at the town like a bird.” Stafford said he wasn’t a waving man, he was a measuring and making things run straight man, and Ned said, “Same religion, different hymn.” Later, with beers half-drunk and the footy on a screen in a corner arguing with the after-work crowd, Ned leaned his elbow on the table and looked at Stafford like he was trying to line a bubble in a level. “You’ve got that face,” he said. “The one where you’ve decided to do a thing and you’re pretending you haven’t, and it’s lovely and excruciating.” Stafford told him to focus on his chips and Ned told him to focus on his sky. Outside, the night was the clean kind that let the stars show themselves without asking permission, and Stafford drove home with the windows down because the air knew his name.

The off-site day started with a sky the exact color of a sheet hung out and caught before the rain. The place was on the edge of town in an industrial park where the buildings had been designed by a committee that respected rectangles. Too many skylights was an accurate description: old domes and long panels of corrugated fibreglass, some of them sun-brittle, all of them ready to pretend they were solid until you tested the theory. Isobel was there before him with a clipboard and a man called Matt with a roll of red danger tape and a voice that had learned how to say no without sounding like a kind of violence. They walked the roof before anyone else arrived, their boots sounding out the truth of it. She pointed out the places that had that pale, sickly look, and he knelt and put a hand near one to feel the give and then stood because the feeling made something old move in his stomach. “We’ll tape everything like a birthday party,” she said. “No one goes where the tape is unless they want me to tell their mother what they were thinking.” He nodded and he could already hear himself saying to a stranger, “Harness first, then you get to have an argument with your drill.”

The students arrived in ones and twos, men and women with gear and lunches and that angle to their shoulders that comes from wanting to impress yourself. He stood at the base of the access ladder and checked harnesses gently and made people rethread their buckles and showed them how a lanyard falls if it isn’t attached properly. He found he could say, “That will kill you if you let it,” and sound like he was making a joke that wasn’t a joke. Isobel moved through them like a shepherd who has read the weather. She made pairs. She tied bright flags to things that needed to be bright. When someone tried to lift a panel with their back she tapped them on the shoulder and said, “Your knees are volunteers,” and demonstrated, and the person did it right and no one made a big thing out of it and he felt a small thank you for being in a room with a woman who knew how to spend her attention.

Work began in that satisfying jerkiness group tasks have, with waiting and then sudden busy. He found himself on a section of roof with a man who’d done one thousand roofs and a woman who had done none and was a quick study with an elegant disregard for her own strength. He marked fixings; he watched for feet that drifted toward bad plastic like moths; he said, “Stay on the steel, stay on the steel,” like a call and response. At eleven-thirty a boot slid where boots had wanted to slide in the wet and a leg went out and he shouted before his mouth knew what he was doing. The man froze, and Stafford was close enough to grab his harness strap and pull him into the umbra of a purlin, the way you haul someone out of a crowded pool and into a lane. The moment stretched itself into a shape like rubber and then snapped back and became a story the man would tell at dinner. The man laughed and swore and looked down at the skylight that had held and would not next time. Isobel was there immediately with a hand on the man’s shoulder and a voice that took the sting out without making it painless. She looked over at Stafford and in that look he felt the exact weight of responsibility as if it had been weighed on a kitchen scale and measured in cups. She mouthed a thank you and coughed when she finished mouthing it and then was already somewhere else the way water is somewhere else even while you’re still looking at where it was.

They ate sitting on a roof edge with their feet braced like climbers. Isobel had a plastic container with cut oranges that she offered down the line like a communion plate. She had a thermos that produced tea the color of decisions. The wind smelt like warm steel and sandwich ham, and the sun sat on their shoulders and did its daily reminder that it didn’t need anything from them. She said to him, “You made a good noise,” and he said, “It wasn’t a choice of word so much as a shape,” and she laughed her short laugh and shook her head. “My first boss used to say your voice should carry three rafters and no more,” she said. “Otherwise you’re singing and no one takes instruction from opera.” He told her about a man on a crew who had sung out “skylight” like it was a hymn, and how everyone had moved like a school of fish. “Better than religion,” she said. “Because you can actually show people the rafter.” They sat not quite touching, boots lined up like sensible punctuation. He asked about the Ballan people and she said she had sent them a postcard of lemons with faces and a thank you that wasn’t enough. He told her his mother had a lemon tree that gave up two brave fruits this year and a magpie that interrogated him, and she said, “Does the bird mark you absent when you leave?” and he said it did and he loved that she had said it before he had thought to.

Afternoon brought a rhythm they could have danced to if their bodies had been any kind of musicians. Panels went down and then up because a bracket had been sly, and then down again, and there were voices calling for more bolts and fewer egos and someone asking for a marker like the one that writes on the future. He stood in a switchroom with a man who had discovered that the original installer of the building had done a thing that had seemed clever and unkind both, and he talked him gently through lock-out tags and the reality that looking at something and naming it off does not make it off. He liked the way the tags felt in his hands, the small authority of them, the bright language. He thought of his father and his test lamp, of the exact care of a man who had not trusted indicators unless his gut had nodded as well. When a student came to tell him that her drill had decided not to be involved any longer, he gave her his without that pained look men get at the divorce of a tool and its owner. “Batteries are union,” he said, and she laughed and ran.

By four the array was down and the inverters blinked in a promising way, and the roof had that end-of-day look where it’s both tidy and exhausted. Isobel gathered them and said words that weren’t quite a speech and weren’t instruction and managed to be both affection and a reminder that roofs are not gentlemen. She shook his hand like he was not a student, and she folded money into it with an apology. He tried to refuse and she told him not to be ridiculous, which for a moment made him feel like a boy who had been told to wear his boots. “I like the way you argue with bolts,” she said, almost idly, as if she were commenting on the taste of tea. “It makes other people straighten their lines without feeling they’ve been made to.” He didn’t know what to do with the sentence, so he put it into his pocket with his phone and his keys and the edges of it scratched him all the way home.

She sent him a link to a public talk the library was hosting on the very modern virtue of not frying the grid. It had three speakers with hard jaws in their small photographs and one with a tired scarf and the eyes he knew. He RSVP’d because saying yes to a thing that included her did not feel like trespassing. He arrived early because he always did, and he sat in the third row because that was where he could hear people breathe. The room filled with the polite noise of interest. She spoke without tricks, made friends with the floor, and told a story about a small town whose solar outputs had coincided with a footy final and a bakery that had suddenly learned what demand looked like, and she laughed at the way the grid had shrugged and then had to think. Someone from the back asked about feed-in tariffs like they had been personally wronged by the concept of arithmetic, and she did not flinch. She said the words policy and fair and future in a way that didn’t taste like politician. Stafford sat very still and let the sound of her come into him like rain into a tank and he did not drink at once; he held it.

After, he stood in the awkward cluster of people who want to speak to the person who has just spoken, and he moved in and out of others’ shadows as they practiced their gratitude. When his turn came he had nothing intelligent, so he went with true. “I liked the bakery,” he said, and she said, “Of course you did,” and then in a lower tone told him that one of the other speakers had called her earlier to check if she was going to “do the emotional bit,” and she had told them no, she was going to do the bit with numbers. He wanted to say that numbers can be emotional if you let them, but a woman with a tote bag stepped forward and asked Isobel very earnestly if she thought the sun has an agenda, and the moment went where all moments go. He walked out into Moorabool Street and the air had a sweetness to it like the inside of bakeries after they are closed and only the bread remains to relax. He walked down to the water because that was what he did when he had more in him than anywhere to put it.

The test was on a Thursday that arrived pretending it was an ordinary day and then set its teeth in his wrist. He sat at a table and the room did that thing where everything near became both too loud and too quiet. He filled in his name in the box, he read the first question twice and smiled because it was an easy path into the woods. He did voltage rise and conductor size and wrote notes in margins he had no permission to write in because it pleased him to put his own small road signs down as he went. He thought of Isobel’s hand when she wrote a “3” and he drew his own like a man learning a new instrument. He finished with time and he did that betrayal of going back and checking and changing a thing once and then changing it back, and then he put down his pen because at some point the lesson is to trust the man you brought. He walked out with people who had twenty versions of the sentence “That was okay, I guess,” ready to leave their mouths. In the hallway, he caught a glance of her through the little window of the office where someone was stamping envelopes, and she raised her eyebrows as if to ask him a question and he nodded once like a man who has lifted a bag of cement and kept walking. He drove to the pier and he sat and he didn’t count the pylons, and a gull stood on a mooring bollard and stared at him like he owed it a fish. He said out loud, “Not today,” and the gull blinked and went to stare at a different man.

His mother rang to ask if he had eaten and he said, “I did a test,” and she made that ah noise that contains a kitchen and a hallway and the smell of boiling vegetables. “Well then,” she said. “Sit down and drink water. Your father used to drink water after any kind of effort and say it cured everything.” He was going to say that there are things water doesn’t help with—the spaces between ribs, the ache of wanting a story to go a particular way—but he said instead, “I’ll drink water,” and he did, standing at the sink and watching the lemon tree pretend not to be listening.

The results came by email with a subject line so bland it could have been about toner cartridges. He opened it, and there it was, the word he wanted, and he leaned against the bench and let the weight of relief sit on him like a dog that trusted him. He didn’t whoop because that wasn’t his style, but he beamed at the kettle as if it had been slow but faithful. He forwarded the email to his mother because she would not know what it meant but she would know the shape of his pride, and he wrote to Isobel with a sentence that had four words in it and none were the wrong ones. She replied with one: good, and a little animated party popper, which was so unlike her it made him grin in his quiet kitchen like a fool.

On a Saturday that had a hangover from Friday’s rain, he went to paint shops and stood in front of charts like a man consulting oracles. He brought samples back to the van and held them up and placed them down and watched the light argue with each one. A child in a pram pointed at him knowingly, and the father said, “He’s doing his best,” like they were a chorus. In the end he chose a gray that hid dust and weather and the marks of ladders leaning, a gray that was not pretending to be anything else. He booked the paint and the signwriting and told himself he would keep the van’s voice low, not a shout, not a whisper. On the inside of the driver’s door where only he would see it when he opened it, he wrote in marker, small and private, simple, and then laughed at himself and wiped most of it off, leaving a ghost of letters he could pretend were a smudge.

Ned dragged him to Kardinia Park with two tickets and a punnet of hot chips so fresh they had menace. They found their seats and the ground breathed under them like a beast that had persuaded a city it was a friend. Stafford watched the ball move and the crowd react like a machine made of meat. He thought of sitting here with his father, the way they had sat with their knees touching because the seats required it and because it was one of the features of love that you find any excuse to be nearer. Ned shouted abuse at an umpire with the creativity of a man who had been denied art at school, and Stafford laughed with his chest and then looked down at the grass and felt, for a second, that his life had threads that crossed and held, even when he tried to pretend they didn’t.

He made a list of clients who had mentioned solar in passing and called two of them and was careful how he spoke. He asked questions about their roofs like he was asking where they were from. He set two site visits and he packed his harness even though he knew he would only look from ladders and not step onto a panel yet. He walked around a house with a woman in a dressing gown who had seen three salesmen but believed none of them, and he pointed at the small inconveniences in her roof with a finger that made apologies as it pointed. He told her a truth about shade that made her sigh and then thank him for saving her from her own enthusiasm. He wrote her a quote that contained math and also respect. He didn’t push because pushing had never given him anything but blisters. He went home and put the quote into his new business file and wrote next to it not a sale, a conversation, and felt both like a man who had found a path and another who had just noticed he was wearing new shoes.

One evening, with the day sloped gently down and the radio telling him something about rain that would not arrive, his phone buzzed with a message from Isobel that was almost absurdly domestic. Do you know anyone with a hand-truck? it read. There is an object in my hallway I promised a friend I’d shift and it turns out I own optimism, not leverage. He wrote back that he was the kind of man who slept with a hand-truck under his bed and he could be there in twenty minutes if she could cope with him being smug about it. She sent a smiling face that wasn’t a smile because nothing small on a screen is ever what you think it is, and he put the hand-truck in the van and laughed out loud alone because the world sometimes behaved in ways that looked like a script.

Her place smelled like paper and oranges and furniture that had opinions. The object was a second-hand workbench, heavy and earnest, that had decided to be stubborn because someone before them had assembled it in the hallway and then relocated it by willpower. He looked at it and placed his hands on the edges like a man reading braille, and she watched him with the interested wariness of a person about to learn a new trick. They took it apart with the respect you give an old machine: one bracket at a time, remembering which bolt matched which hole, giving names to pieces so they wouldn’t feel lost. They moved it to the study where the light knew how to land and put it back together, and when it stood on its own legs something in him reached quietly across to tap something in her and they both pretended to adjust a screw. She made tea without instruction. He tried not to look at the spines of her books in case they contained too much of her. They talked about the absurdity of workshops existing in houses where power points are not near where anything needs power, and she said there are people who put benches in rooms and then never use them because the idea was the point, and he said he had never liked ideas without sawdust. She coughed once into her elbow and he asked if she was tired, and she said she was a little and he said he had to go and she agreed and he left with his hand-truck and the shape of the workbench in his head like a photograph that would not yet decide whether to fade.

At three in the morning he woke with his heart doing that small stupid dance it liked, and he lay very still and listened to the house. The fan argued with the air and lost. A car somewhere made a noise the shape of a man clearing his throat. He thought about roofs and fathers and the way hands know what to do if you let them, and he thought about Isobel, the way she holds a marker, the way she had stood beside him on the roof like they were co-owners of a responsible set of decisions. He knew enough to leave the ache alone when it came, to let it be present with him instead of trying to make it into something it wasn’t ready to be. He thought of the lemon tree, and of the magpie with its precise moralism, and he let himself think, for a minute and then two, that there might be a room he would walk into one day where he was not an apprentice to his own life but a man at his bench, making.

Morning did that trick where it pretends it is reluctant and then arrives in a rush. He made toast and did not set it on fire. He set up the new to-do list for the week with a pen that had more ink than it should. He took two old ceramic fuses out of his pocket and put them on his windowsill, because he keeps things like that as talismans as if one day he will string them and make a necklace of redundancy. He drove out to a farm that had three dogs and a woman with a voice that had been sharpened by wind, and he fixed a light in a shed that had never mindfully considered the concept of a shed. He moved between jobs like a man on tram tracks, comfortable with the rails, distrustful of the places between. He put his hand on a hot water service and listened to it sulk. He told a man of seventy about the existence of voltage drop and watched the man’s mouth make an O like he had just seen a trick but in a good way.

Later he parked on Pakington Street and, deliberately, put his phone into the glovebox and left it there while he ate a pie sitting on a bench that had collected names carved with pocket knives. He watched a boy scuff the exact same path a thousand boys had scuffed and felt a wave of fondness for every person who had ever dragged a foot while thinking. He thought about what he wanted his signwriting to say, and he thought about what he wanted his life to say, and he decided there was no reason those sentences had to be different. He would be a man who arrived before the day decided, who made roofs honest, who bent conduit like a poet makes a line, who stood at the base of ladders and sent people up and brought them home again. He would not be flashy and he would not be cruel and he would take off his boots at doors because someone’s mother had washed that floor.

When he got home, a small envelope was half pushed under his door. It had no name on it. Inside was a postcard of lemons with faces, exactly as Isobel had described sending, except these lemons were wearing sunglasses as if fruit had discovered irony. On the back was a scribble: thanks for the bench rescue and the hand-truck superstition. If you ever need soup, I am suburb-adjacent competent. I. He held the card and felt his body do something extremely unmanly and extremely mammal, a little full-body yes that he hoped the magpie would forgive him for. He propped the card against his father’s notebook and, not knowing if this was the kind of thing men did, he took a photograph of it with his phone and then did nothing with the photograph because keeping it was the point.

The night sighed into rain and the lemon tree made the sound of water landing on wax. He stood under the eave and watched the drops bounce on the pavers like tiny creatures that had not yet learned how to fall. He spoke, out loud because no one was there to charge him for the performance, and told the air that he was grateful for roofs and rails and neatness and clicks that sound like agreements and for women who write a “3” like a looped heart and for men who taught boys to put hoses away. He finished speaking and the rain spoke back the way rain does, without punctuation but with a kind of grammar that has nothing to do with rules and everything to do with being alive. He went inside, wiped his boots on the mat, placed his tools on the bench in an order he could prove to himself was right, and he slept like he was on a roof with a harness he had checked twice.Chapter 6

The signwriter came with a roll of vinyl and a calm that made Stafford want to hand him decision-making for the rest of the day. They did it in the driveway, the van washed the night before until its gray made a dignified argument for itself. The man stood in the kind of balance you get from a lifetime of ladders and shop windows and eased the letters on with a squeegee and a gaze that accepted bubbles only as brief stages. Stafford watched his name become visible in a font that didn’t pretend it was fun and didn’t pretend it was a sermon. ELECTRICAL sat under it in smaller letters, solar an honest addition like a second line of a poem you’d thought you’d finished. When the signwriter ran a finger along an edge and said, “There,” Stafford felt that small private thrill of seeing order become public, and then a flush of unease, as if he had admitted in his own handwriting that he wanted things and the town might hold him to it.

The magpie did a reconnaissance circuit, came in low, and delivered a peck to its own reflection on the passenger door with a clack that sounded like a judge. Stafford stood with his hands in his pockets and said, “Mate, that’s me,” and the bird hopped sideways and tilted its head as if to say, That is not you, that is audacity turned into paint. He flicked his fingers at it and it considered him and the van and the day, and then left to harass a bins-and-recycling worker who had the aura of a man who had bargained for a different week. Stafford rubbed the beak mark away with his sleeve and saw the ghost of it remain anyway, a tiny crescent, like all incidents leave when you look under good light.

The call came before nine, Isobel’s number with a training center prefix because institutions like to stand between you and the people you want to answer. Leak, she said, as if it were a personality. The storeroom had woken up damp and the roof over the welding bays was telling a new story. “I’ve rung maintenance,” she added, “but if you were idle and looking to be a foolish hero, I would not stop you.” He wasn’t idle and hero sat wrong in his mouth, but foolish sounded about right, so he said he could be there in twenty and threw tarps and rope and a box of screws into the van because if you showed up you might as well be the person who had thought of rope.

The air over the center tasted tinny, the kind of cold that catches on the way in. He climbed the internal stairs that had absorbed a thousand boots’ worth of instruction and met her in a corridor that smelled like paint and bad coffee, both of which he found broadly endearing. “You shouldn’t be up there,” he said without thinking, and she made a face that suggested he had correctly identified something and should mind his tone. “I’m wearing shoes,” she said. “I will stand on safe steel and point at chaos until it submits.” On the roof the water had found a path between two sheets of Colorbond because one screw had decided ten years was a good innings and was considering retirement. They moved in the delicate dance of people who set up in the rain: tarp here, rope under, knot, the slap of fabric against hands, the slide of a clamp onto a rafter because no one trusts gaffer tape in a wind that has something to prove. Isobel’s hair escaped its neatness and an old clip betrayed her and she made a face at it and allowed the rain to teach it humility. “Bowline?” she asked of the knot he was making, and he said, “Variant,” and she said, “Looks like a knot I’d introduce to my mother,” and he laughed, short and warm, and pulled. The tarp fought and then accepted its fate.

They were wet in that honest way that doesn’t leave room for pretense. Water ran off the end of his nose and he wiped it with the back of his hand without becoming a man who complained. Her scarf had been demoted to pocket; she coughed once, low and manageable, and he delivered his best useless proverb about not mixing DC with water and she gave him the smile that made a tiny door open and close without inviting anyone in. He gave her his beanie because his ears didn’t mind and hers would, and she argued for three seconds and then put it on with the kind of grace that made it look as if she had always intended to wear someone else’s hat on a roof in rain. The maintenance man arrived with a ladder and a suspicion that everything would be more work than it should be, and Stafford showed him the screw and the path and the tarp, and the man nodded as if acknowledging that he had found the right level of fuss. “We’ll fix it proper when this stops,” the man said. “For now it’ll sulk.” They left it sulking and went in to drip politely on a concrete floor.

The bakery over the road had scones that had never learned moderation and tea that came in thick white cups like old hospitals. They sat at a high table and held their hands around mugs as if the mugs had authority. Her hair, drying, found order again, and Stafford watched her scan the room out of habit as if a student might ask her to explain PV curves near the jam. “Isobel is my aunt’s name,” he said, because he had meant to say something else and his mouth had veered. She raised her eyebrows in a way that said the sentence was a surprise and she was game to see where he was going to store it. “I didn’t grow up with it,” she said. “I was Izzy until I wasn’t. There are whole years where a person is a variation and then one day they look up and refuse.” He thought of the story his mother told about the boy he had been who wanted to be called Ford for a week because he loved a ute that had died at the side of the road like a soldier. He told her the thing his father had said about being where you’re going before the day commits, and she said, “He sounds like the kind of man who trusted the morning,” and he nodded because that was exactly it. He noticed, again, the little E.H. on the back of her watch when she dabbed rain off the table with a napkin, and before he could ask she said, “It was my mother’s. She had a name that wanted frills, and she chose not to wear them. I keep it because it ticks even when I’m bad at doing the right maintenance,” and she smiled that sideways smile that told him he could put the curiosity down.

A message came from Ravi about a homeowner out in Grovedale who had rung the center because they had seen a brochure and decided the brochure was safer than the isolator that had started to smell like a small bad idea. Isobel held the phone and looked at Stafford, and he said, “We can go,” before he had consciously balanced the jobs in his head. They paid and crossed the road in air that had remembered it was winter, and in the van she fiddled with the radio until she found static that called itself music. The rain slackened, then regrouped, the wipers made their polite arguments with the glass, and they drove in that companionable silence that is a kind of grammar.

The house was one of those 80s brick boxes that had been unromantic and were now, suddenly, the sort of thing people celebrated in articles. The couple who met them had faces that had learned weather and then city air, and their way of standing hinted at dance lessons once upon a time. “It’s at the isolator,” the woman said, and the wall-mounted box looked at them with the blank guilt of plastic that had not aged well. The label was faded, the conduit told a story of an installer who had chosen a route for reasons that would never be explained, and the smell—acrid, mean—made Stafford want to pat the air down. He killed the AC first, because training rides your muscles the same way riding a bike does. He put on gloves not because he needed the layer as much as because it made his mind click into a set of moves. Isobel watched the couple while he undid the cover. “We’ll make it safe,” she told them in the kind of voice you use in supermarkets when a toddler has sat down and decided the floor is home, and the woman nodded, the nod of someone who has been holding her breath and is ready to step back into being held up by oxygen and a stranger’s competence.

Inside, the isolator had done the trick where one contact had decided that poor pressure and weather made a good marriage. Plastic had blackened and then gone soft, and the edges of the failure had that delicate melted look like sugar taken too far. He looked at Isobel and she looked at him and he saw in that small exchange a series of agreed-upon verbs. She stood with the couple and spoke to them about standards in a way that didn’t make them feel they were being examined, and he did the terminal work: an MC4 disconnect with a click that was too loud because his fingers had decided to be dramatic, a careful path of cables away from anything that had an agenda, a visual check of the string because you always check the string. He taped off what would not be used, clear tags, his own handwriting on them, the kind his father had taught by example. When he stepped back and looked at the isolator, what it had been and wasn’t now, he felt that mixture of anger and satisfaction that comes from cleaning up another man’s shortcuts. The couple thanked them like people who have recently regained the ability to sleep. “There’s a salesman who told me we shouldn’t worry about a little smoke,” the man said, and Stafford held up a hand and said, “You won’t let me say the thing I want to say,” and they laughed, grateful to be made to laugh into a room that had held a scare.

He dropped her back at the center because she had twelve things to do, and she put the beanie on the dashboard with the neatness of a student returning a borrowed instrument. “You’re good at cuts,” she said, the way someone might note that another person swims like they meant to and not like drowning is a hobby. “And you talk to people like they’re not problems. That’s rarer than it should be.” He said something self-deprecating about cupboards and cable noodles and she said, “Don’t do that,” with a gentleness that had spine. “Take the compliment and move it into a shelf where you can reach it.” When she stepped out of the van, she did that small cough again and lifted a hand without looking back, and he watched her go inside with the same feeling he’d had as a boy when his father had gone into the shed with a box of lugs and a quiet plan.

He changed in the laundry because the rain had gotten under his clothes and thought about staying. The washing machine had a way of complaining that sounded like the low joking grumble of two men who know they will fix something and also that it will take longer than it should. He drove down to Clifton Springs with a jar of marmalade his mother liked because he had looked at it in his cupboard and it had reminded him of her, which is reason enough. She was in the front yard with secateurs fighting a plant that had impersonated a bush and turned out to be three plants and one idea. “You look like a man who’s had rain,” she said, which is what mothers do, they point at you and tell you what you already know and it feels like affection. He told her about the leak and the isolator and the couple with the soft hands that had once been dancers, and she made those small mother noises that contain whole neighborhoods. “Invite someone to the market,” she said when he had finished telling stories that had made his chest feel less busy. “Not this week if you’re feverish about your van, but one day. Buy pears and pretend you know about pears.” He shook his head and said he didn’t need pears and she said, “Bring soup then, to someone who needs soup, if you insist on being unromantic.”

In the cupboard behind his mugs the pumpkin recipe waited with the patience of inanimate objects. He took it out and propped it against the jug and looked at the handwriting that had used lines before lines were printed. His father had circled the word cumin and added a question mark like he was negotiating with the future. He cut pumpkin like someone making small steps into a cold sea. He chopped an onion the way all men do when they want to be thought capable but do not like tears, and he swore softly and felt better. He cooked it in the heavy pot that had belonged to his mother and that she pretended she hadn’t done him a favor by forgetting to take home. He listened to onions doing their polite fizz, the promise of sweetness, and he let the recipe boss him around, the way men who have spent all day giving instructions sometimes like to be instructed. He added stock in a way that would have made his father roll his eyes and say it was too salty and then eat two bowls. He blended and burnt his thumb and swore again. He tasted, and it was honest and a little flat and he fixed it with lemon because the tree was right there and because sometimes the answer is actually outside your door.

He poured some into a jar that had once held bolts and now held seasons. He thought about writing a note and walking it to Highton and putting it on a step and risking the embarrassment of being a man who leaves soup. He stood by the sink with the jar warm under his fingers and imagined the walk and the knock and the face in the doorway with its exact lines and the cough that might or might not arrive to punctuate the scene. He put the jar down, not because he had decided against it, but because not rushing was a trick he had learned the hard way. His phone buzzed with a message that said simply good save and he replied careful is my religion and she wrote back amen and then a line that said, I do soup too, when required, which made him laugh in his kitchen with the lemon smell still on his hands.

He sat on the back steps with damp jeans and the jar by his ankle cooling slowly. The magpie gave him the side-eye from the lemon tree and then committed to its song like it had a schedule. The neighborhood did its evening noises—someone doing push-ups with a noise that sounded like complaint and commitment at once, a woman practicing a blues scale on a trumpet in a house where the hallway keeps secrets, a child asking the same question four ways because the answer had been interesting. He watched the light come down the lane behind the fences, laying itself out so gently you could mistake it for mercy. He thought of roofs and rails and the soft click of connectors, that small assent he could still hear at night like a kindness. He thought of a watch with initials and a story that had slotted into place without fuss. He thought that he might one day put soup on a stoop, and if he did, he would not leave a note because the soup would be the whole sentence.

The call came the next morning in the thin part of dawn when the house is honest. It was from the training office, a request couched as a favor and then quickly framed as money because people think that makes the favor respectable. Would he help on Saturday, do a safety talk at the start of a practical for new ones, help mark the part where men who don’t read instructions ask stiff questions to cover their bluster? He said yes like a man who had already pulled boots on in his mind and was at the roller door with the keys in his teeth. When he hung up he opened his father’s notebook and wrote Saturday: talk roofing, not falling through opinions; bring tags; bring the sentence that goes three rafters and no more. He drew a small square that could have been an isolator or a window and put a dot in one corner like a tiny star. He felt the house wake around him, wires whispering their low gossip in the walls, the roof holding, the lemon tree scratching the air at the window as if to remind him that under all of the jobs and the names and the little public letters stuck carefully to the side of a van, there is the basic truth a man can build on: you go where you’re going before the day decides to be day, you make a thing work, you leave it better. He finished his toast over the sink and let the crumbs go where they would and, when he left, he touched the jar of soup as if it were a lucky stone and told himself he was a patient man, and then, on the way out, he put the beanie into the van because the roof always has weather, even when the sky is clean.Chapter 7

Saturday got up clean and unarguable, a blue that had rinsed itself well in the night. Stafford woke before the alarm and lay there listening to the small noises houses make when they are still making peace with the morning—the fridge declaring its purpose, a pipe clearing its throat somewhere under the bathroom sink, a car two streets over that had a starter motor with opinions. He got up because lying still felt like stepping off the first rung of a ladder and changing your mind. The lemon tree wore beads of water on its leaves and the magpie arrived with the solemnity of a clerk taking up a post. “You’ll have to sit through the talk too,” he told it, and it twitched its tail and made the kind of sound that could be approval or a note recorded for later use. He made toast with butter the color reports call golden, filled the thermos he took out only on days when he needed the feeling of being a person who owned a thermos, and laid out tags and straps and a set of bright flags that looked like you were allowed to have fun and then reminded you you weren’t.

At the training yard the air tasted like wet steel and grass, a particular flavor of competence. The mock roofs waited like stage sets, and beyond them the real roofs of the town rose and fell, a chorus line of angles. New faces arrived quietly or all at once, the way people do when they are measuring themselves against a day. This cohort had work boots with their price tags still in their laces, old men with hands like knots learning late on purpose, two young women in high ponytails that said try me, and three or four who were clearly here because the world had tilted and they were going to walk on it anyway. Isobel stood with a clipboard and a scarf that knew its job, Ravi with a box of connectors and a grin that didn’t care what you thought of it. “You do the three rafters and no more,” Isobel said to Stafford under her breath with that sideways warmth of command, and he nodded and stood where his voice would carry and not turn into weather.

He told them his name without making the mistake of making it an apology. He told them his job because that was the currency required. He held up a lanyard and said very calmly that gravity would win every argument if invited. He walked them to the ugly truth of fiberglass skylights and the nice lie they tell with their opacity. He told them about the boot that had gone where boots had wanted to go and the pull, the noise he had made that wasn’t a word and then turned into one afterward. He did not show off because showing off is like stepping into a skylight to prove a point. He kept his sentences short enough that they didn’t need to take a breath halfway through. He made them clip into a cable that would hold a truck and then made them look up at their own hands doing it so they would remember them later in the wind. He moved his palm over a sheet and said feel the flex, feel how it gives; he put his boot on a purlin and said this, always this. He was not funny, but a laugh came anyway when he told them the roof did not care about your feelings, and they gave him that laugh in good faith. He used the sentence his first boss had given him about tying off like you are married to something and the ring cost money, and he watched as a couple of men lifted their eyes briefly to the rafters as if considering vows.

Isobel watched him the way you watch a new apprentice use a knife, not anxious exactly but ready to take the blade if needed. She leaned against the rail with her clipboard tucked and her scarf doing that clever thing of making a neck look like the neck of a person who owns their winter. The cough appeared once and was folded away. When he finished, she stepped forward and threaded her own line through his, spoke about why export limits were boring and therefore crucial, how a harness is a tool not a performance, how every team has someone who thinks neatness is the enemy of speed and you must make that person into a neat person with kindness and if kindness fails, paperwork. They broke the group into the usual friendly rivalries, Ravi sending one batch to the grumpy shed, Isobel taking the suits with the bright lunchboxes, Stafford given the middle—men and women who were game and might try to be too brave.

He walked among them, became a weather system they could pass through. He bent over a young bloke’s buckle and re-threaded it with the casual intimacy of someone fixing a crooked tie. He showed a woman how to step across a channel, less leg, more line. An older man made a joke about falling not hurting, it’s the landing, and Stafford let his face do the thing it did when he took a man’s bluster and put it gently back in his pocket. “I need you to land well at four when you get home,” he said, and the man made the small face people make when someone has handed them their future at the cost of one wisecrack. Rails went up. Chalk lines appeared straight and then became not-straight under a square. The wind pushed a panel and was told no by a hand and a foot, and the hand looked surprised to have opinions. He found himself repeating, “Stay on the steel,” like a prayer.

At smoko the kettle produced its brown honesty and the biscuits were the kind you forget until you taste one and then you remember every roof you have ever stood on. He stood with his back to the roller door because he liked air on his shoulders and because he could find her in the field of people that way without it looking like a search. She came by with a packet of sugar that had a tourist tram printed on it and held it out to him without asking if he took sugar. He shook his head and said he was already sweet, which was not his joke but the one that had volunteered, and she rolled her eyes in the manner of a person who had not been born yesterday. “I made something,” he said, surprising himself and then accepting the surprise, because the jar had been in the van all morning reheating its courage. “Too much, really. Pumpkin. My father left a recipe that made more than a man should eat alone. If you wanted it, I could relieve my kitchen of the responsibility.” For a half-second she looked at him as if he had offered a cat, and then her face did a small, good change. “Soup is one of the acceptable forms of barter,” she said quietly. “Put it on my desk before the afternoon eats us.”

He carried the jar in during the lunch break when everyone had scattered to sit on curbs and the backs of utes and a crate that had seen too many backsides. He put the jar on her desk and did not leave a note because the soup was the sentence. He went back out and caught a roll of tape thrown well and nodded at the thrower because you always acknowledge a good throw. The afternoon had that cohesion that comes when people begin to forget themselves and remember they have bodies with tasks. A man skinned a knuckle and bled dramatically and then stopped like a gentleman. A woman fouled a bolt, swore and then apologized to the bolt, which is always a promising sign, and tried again slower. Isobel moved lazily across the yard like a sheepdog with a degree. She stepped onto the first rungs of ladders and stood there, not climbing, delivering coaching at knee height. When the man who had joked earlier set a foot too close to a pale patch she was already there with two fingers on his sleeve and a voice that sounded like the exact line between suggestion and order. “Back,” she said. “Less romance, more life,” and he gave her the look men give women who save them before they earn the right to protest.

By four the rails were down again and the chalk had gone from crisp to smudge. They did the debrief that wasn’t a debrief, more a list of things to keep and things to drop. A young bloke who had started the day keeping his chin high had it down where it belonged, pointing at what he was doing. The older man had three quiet sentences everyone could live with. Isobel gave out a small wrapped chocolate to someone who had eaten humble pie without flinching, a ritual she appeared to pull out when someone deserved sugar more than a certificate. She caught Stafford’s eye across the yard and then looked away in the efficient style he had catalogued in his head as a way of saying I saw and we will not make it fuss.

He packed the flags and the tags and the sentence about three rafters back into the van and found he didn’t need to stand around pretending to tidy a thing that was already tidy. Traffic leaned one way and then the other on the ring road like a line of animals that had agreed to go quietly. He remembered the jar and the desk and imagined her lifting the lid and sniffing like a person in an advertisement, which was so unlike her he laughed at himself. His phone pinged when he was halfway home and he did that reprehensible thing where you look anyway at a red light. The message was a photograph of a spoon resting in orange, the caption not a caption but two words: right kind. He smiled at the steering wheel because telling the wheel felt less foolish than telling the sky.

Ned rang at the exact moment a kettle comes to the point where it decides to be steam rather than water. “You were educatin’ the youth?” he asked, chewing. “I dreamt you had a whistle. You should never have a whistle.” Stafford told him about the morning and downplayed the soup because telling Ned a story was like letting a dog sniff a thing and then pretending it’s not food. “You made soup,” Ned said anyway, like an accusation delivered with love. “You are in peril,” and then did a voice like a newsreader, “Local electrician in soup-based incident; town divided.” They arranged beer and then didn’t, because Stafford’s body had already signaled that it intended to sit down with a bowl and a television that played men interviewing other men about sport and the size of lips applied to ice-buckets. He ate at his bench with the jar empty and clean next to him, ready for the doctrine of returning.

He woke in the night to the small violence of a dream turning and did not get up. The house drew breath and the magpie somewhere out there offered two testing notes and then decided the conversation could wait for morning. When morning came it did not ask for permission. The lemon tree had shoulders of brightness where sun touched its fruit. He washed the jar and was absurdly careful because keeping it intact felt like passing an exam. He put it in the van not because he intended to drive to Highton and stand at a door like a postman with nerves—she would be at the market because she was a person who had mentioned pears in a way that made him think pears had been waiting for a woman like her—and because he had learned that not rushing was a muscle.

The market unfurled itself as if the town had decided to be a village just for the morning. Card tables bore bread and the tins that bread insists on when it wants to look rustic. A man with a fedora sharpened knives with a seriousness that could have solved a war. Kids ate strawberries and remembered their faces needed the exact same red. He found himself moving through the crowd not as a hunter but as a person taking inventory: the woman from the community install was buying baklava and telling the stallholder that her cucumbers had made grown men cry, a man with a dog that had discovered the joy of leashes, a bass line from someone with a guitar who wasn’t yet ready to be told about keys. He saw her by the pears and the lemons because of course she would be there; the universe writes some jokes because it can’t help itself. She had her hair unbossed and a canvas bag that had earned its stains. She weighed pears in her palm like they were decisions and kept two and put one back. He approached without stealth because stealth in markets is creepy. “Taste the same as the photo?” he asked, and she looked up and smiled a small yes that he tucked away.

They walked down the aisle the way people do when they are not yet an item and the crowd knows it and is kind. He bought cable ties at a stall that sold everything between anchors and hope. She bought ginger and a loaf that would collect crumbs in the bag and mark the day. They stood outside the hall where the Rotary men did egg-and-bacon rolls with a speed that could power a small town and she said, “The knife man would have a view on your drivers,” and he said, “He would say they are too sentimental,” and she shook her head. The barista from Moorabool popped up from nowhere with a grin like a side street. “You two shopping for the grid?” she said, in the tone of a person who had chosen mischief and breakfast. “I am always shopping for the grid,” Isobel replied, not missing, and the barista put foam on a flat white like a signature and said, “Market has pears. Life is short. Eat the pear,” and then vanished back into steam.

They sat on a low brick wall that had been warmed by a thousand backsides and drank coffee that tasted like flattening excuses. They talked about names as if it were a topic that could fill a morning. She told him her mother had been a nurse before she was a different kind of strict, and that the watch had come out of a drawer in an afternoon of deciding not to keep a drawer full of dead batteries. He told her he had been Stafford because a man his grandfather had known had been called Stafford and had been a gentleman driver of a sort that no longer exists, and as a boy he had wanted to cut the name in half and become Ford because adults liked it, and she said people have a stage where they want to be cars, and some of them get jobs selling them, and they agreed that trades attract people who prefer nouns you can lift. She laughed at a toddler who made the loud noise toddlers make when confronted with a sausage on bread, and in that laugh he heard the part of her that would allow laughter to take up residence in a life built for lines and standards.

She handed him the jar with the quiet pride of a person who returns things on a schedule unknown to you. It was clean and dry and inside it was a lemon, small and showy, a joke that didn’t require you to laugh out loud. “For replacing what you extracted,” she said. “Also because I have more lemons than sense.” He turned the jar in his hands and felt absurdly seen. He did not say “thank you” like a boy; he said it like a man with a bench and a day. They did not linger because lingering is sometimes a way to crack a thing that should be allowed to set. She had a tutorial at eleven and a rhythm she would not drop. He had a quote to write on a table that demanded a coaster. They parted with a wave that could be mistaken for goodbye to a person met by accident, and he stored it in his head as a line you write and leave space under.

The week opened its mouth and swallowed him whole in the best possible way. Word of mouth, the real electricity, did its small circuits. The woman with the dressing gown accepted his quote after she had insisted on offering him cake as if cake was the fee he had forgotten. He did his first solo install that he would allow himself to name as such, a modest string on a low roof in Belmont with a tilt that made math elegant. He climbed with his harness clicking like punctuation. He laid rails and stood back and looked and let his body tell him if a line was true. He found a rafter that had decided to take a private life as compost and he did the thing that marks the difference between men who want money today and men who want to see the town again tomorrow: he stopped. He called the client down and put his hand on the timber and told her the story of water and time and what screws do when you ask them to hold hands with rot. He spoke the truth about how much of a pain it is to do it properly and how that pain is smaller than the pain of literal gravity. She sighed in the way people sigh when you have invited a bill into a room and thanked him for stopping, as if stopping was a talent and not merely the minimum. He rang a builder he trusted who arrived with a look like a man asked to dance and did the necessary surgery and they went on. At day’s end, when the inverter gave its polite green nod and the monitoring app lit up like a fish tank, the woman clapped her hands the way children clap and then pretended she had not. He went down the ladder last because he liked the feeling of leaving a roof after the others had returned to earth.

Ned texted a photograph of a ceiling patch that had the texture of forgiveness and wrote I can fix your sins for a fee, and Stafford wrote back I don’t sin on weekdays. His mother left a voicemail that said she had made a cake and he could have some if he was passing, and he drove down that evening because cake is cake and because she would look at his face and say the thing mothers say about sleep and he would tell her he was living in hands and lines and her mouth would make pride in a small shape. He told her about the market and the lemon in the jar without adding the captions neither of them needed. She listened as women in their sixties listen when they have had enough of the theater of secrets. “Don’t let your life be only story,” she said, cutting a second slice like she was not to be argued with, and he said he wasn’t and she said, “Yes, you are, but you’re also better than that,” and that was that.

Class began to feel like the edge of a thing rather than its center. The weeks had built a structure you could climb around without falling. The farmer woman had started referring to combiner boxes with the familiarity of a nickname. The bookish man with the careful hands had stopped asking if he could see a different inverter and started asking if he could wire one without a chaperone. The plumber-turned-traitor had fixed a conduit bend so lovely it made another man put his hand on his heart because beauty sneaks in even among men who call beauty soft. Isobel set their final practical with hooks built in, little traps that weren’t traps so much as opportunities for people to realize they were the kind of person who reads the manual right to the end. Her cough had become an echo rather than an actor. She wore a jacket that had learned its lesson about rainspots and a clarity that you only get when your body has returned to being your own.

On the last night, there were certificates, which in themselves meant less than the shape of people’s mouths when they held them. She gave them out with that dry kindness she had finessed into an instrument. “Legal now,” she said, and, “Dangerous in the right direction,” and, “You will do one foolish thing; please limit it to an anecdote,” and the room laughed because it was ready to. When she handed Stafford his she did not add anything and yet he felt the room tilt anyway. Afterward there were handshakes that went for a second too long, and a carton of beer that had been placed on a bench as if by elves but clearly by Ravi, and people said See you on roofs and See you in sheds, and men who had never used each other’s names tried them on and liked the fit.

She found him by letting the crowd drain and then being the remaining shape in his periphery. “Do you want a sentence for clients who need to feel the institution has noticed you?” she asked, and before he could do the dance where he said no while wanting yes, she added, “Not a letter, a sentence. The long version costs more,” and he snorted which is not a laugh but an admission of relief. She wrote on a piece of letterhead in neat black: Stafford G. is competent to the point of boredom and will make your roof live a long life. — I.H. He read it and folded it in half and put it into his notebook like a boy tucking away a train ticket. “You can ring me for questions you already know the answer to,” she added in the tone any doctor would recognize as an instruction disguised as grace. “Not at three in the morning, unless there’s smoke,” and he said he did not call women at three in the morning for anything and she said, “Some men do,” and the ghost of a look crossed her face that suggested she knew more about some men than was healthy, and then it was gone, washed away by the tide of people needing to say thanks one more time.

He worked, because working was the way he knew how to celebrate without accidentally letting off fireworks in his own head. He priced a small system for a teacher who said she liked math because it told the truth and he told her math lies too, it just does it elegantly, and she laughed and signed. He replaced a switchboard in an old weatherboard and was briefly overcome by the neatness the new breakers made like a fresh haircut on a man who has been in a hat for a decade. He went to a café that had decided to be a wine bar at night and fixed a track light that had decided not to participate and was paid in a glass which he took home to drink because he didn’t want to add his laughter to a room that was already full of other people’s. He took the jar back to the place in the cupboard beside the mugs where it had already colonized the space like a citizen. He put the lemon in a bowl and the magpie stared at it through the window like a thief considering a new career.

He dreamed twice in one night, which made the morning feel larger. In the first, he was on a roof made of books and walking without sinking because he had learned to step lightly. In the second, his father stood on the oval at Kardinia Park in a windbreaker that had been a joke even when he had worn it, and he put a hand on Stafford’s shoulder with dry patience and said only, “That’s straight,” and Stafford had woken with his heart full of a good ache. He took the van to the signwriter for the final touches and asked for a small line of numbers under his name in a font that didn’t beg. The man added it with his calm and Stafford had the feeling again that he had admitted to the street that he wanted things.

Rain returned the next day like a party guest who had gone home for a jacket. He put up tarps in a rental that liked to leak into light fittings and said the words tenants fear lightly and then corrected himself because fear is not a toy. He arrived back at his place to find mail that had sat itself down on the mat as if expecting tea. Among it was an invitation printed on A4 with a logo that had never learned humility, halfway to a conference that would be in Sydney for people who liked to talk about electrons into microphones. He put it in the bin and then took it out and used it to wedge the fig in the pot by the door that kept leaning. The magpie approved of the wedge, did a long song that included a note he had not heard before, and he stood there in the drizzle and let the bird finish because you don’t interrupt something beautiful and unbiddable when it is happening on your fence.

Late that afternoon the power went out not just in his house but in the street, with that sudden pause of refrigerators thinking their own thoughts. The lemon tree became more green in the absence of the kitchen light. People stepped onto porches with expressions like a village enacting an old ritual. A man in a dressing gown he pretended was a coat came out and shouted down the street in a voice that had forgotten how to be neighborly, “You out?” and the next house called back, “Yep,” and someone down at the corner said, “I’ve lit a candle,” as if announcing that they had witnessed fire for the first time. He went to the van for a headlamp not because he needed it but because you should be seen to be a man who owns light. He could have gone inside and done nothing, but he found himself walking the fence line and checking in on a woman who had a pram and a confusion about whether warmth and feeding had to be friends right now. He showed a man how to turn off the solar safely so that the electrician who would not arrive tonight would thank him tomorrow. He stood for a moment with a boy who liked the dark because you could see your own breath. The power came back mid-sentence the way power does, and there were small cheers as if someone had kicked a ball through a thing. In the returning hum and the flick of clocks blinking 12:00 the street sighed itself back into private lives.

His phone buzzed with a message while he stood under the eave watching his neighbors return to their television shows and their dinners that believed in microwaves. It read: Did you enjoy your brief career as lantern-man? He wrote back: I was born to own headlamps, and she sent an emoji that looked like a torch that had made peace with its job. Then, after a beat that could have been a spoon tapping a glass, she added: Going to Ballan tomorrow to take lemons to the spare-room people. Want a pie from the bakery you haven’t heard of yet? He looked at the rain doing its fine netting between the fence and the ground and felt the neatness of a life that could hold small additions without breaking. He wrote: I’ll trade you cable ties for pie, and she replied: Every economy finds its level.

Sunday again, and the road up through Anakie took a moodiness he admired. The hills shouldered the weather and the weather sat like a thought on them. He followed her small hatchback at a respectable distance because car-following is an intimacy he did not intend to force. At Ballan, the spare-room people were the exact shape he had imagined: a coupled kindness with hands that had learned to plant and to fix hinges that squeaked. They greeted him as if introductions had been waiting in a drawer for years. They had the kettle on in the way of people whose religion is tea and blankets. They took lemons with reverence and showed off their own tree with the pride of new grandparents. They made him a pie in a paper bag that grease began to confess into immediately. Isobel watched them move through their house like the original stage managers and her face had the particular relief of a person returned to the site of a rescue after they have survived. She coughed once and the woman, whose name turned out to be Anthea, put a hand on her back as if the cough were an animal you could tame, and then removed it with care that felt like applause.

They sat at the table that had witnessed strangers’ elbows and maps and apologies. Stafford listened to a story about a salesman who had stayed for three days by accident and left a note under a cup as if closing a door quietly. He fixed a stiff hinge at the back door because he couldn’t not. He gave the man a trick with a pencil to find a stud when the wall refused to tell you its secrets. He watched Isobel relax into the kind of humility that comes easily to people who are excellent at frighteningly public things and who are, in private, secretly fierce about being human well. When they left, pies on laps and lemons stowed and thanks said too many times and just enough, the road back to Geelong looked more certain than the one up had, which is often the way.

He worked into the week because the week gives you its hand if you offer yours. He found himself on a ladder outside a weatherboard in East Geelong with rain drying into a film on everything, and a man walking past with a dog said, “Stafford, yeah?” and pointed to the side of the van, and he said, “That’s me,” without flinching, and the man gave him a card that said his name and some numbers and then said, “You replaced my neighbor’s board, didn’t swear once,” as if that was worth a referral, which perhaps it was. He got home and the lemon in the jar had given its smell to the cupboard and he liked that, this slow exchange, the way molecules decide where to be without asking.

The next Saturday he turned up at the center for the early talk with one more sentence in his pocket than he’d had last time. He said to the new new ones that roofs are where gravity and pride get into a fight, and that pride must lose early. He put in the bit about regret not clicking and watched as someone’s shoulders moved in a way he recognized: the acceptance that neat might be a religion worth trying. Isobel leaned against the frame of a roller door and made notes on a pad she might never look at again because handwriting is sometimes how you tell your brain to pay attention. She handed him a beanie when he stepped into the yard because his ears had decided to pretend they were tough, and he took it, finally, without the three-second dance.

Late in the day, he found his father’s notebook on his bench where he had left it that morning like a charm. He wrote a line that would mean little to anyone else: soup was the right kind; three rafters; pear economy; first rails true with rot addressed. He put under it the name of the street in Belmont and the address of the bakery in Ballan without the number because he would remember. He closed the book and ran his fingers over the cover the way you do when you are allowing yourself one small ceremony. Outside, the magpie rehearsed something complex and then laughed at itself in the way only birds can. He stood with a lemon in his palm and the beanie in the other hand and felt, briefly and not delicately, like a man standing in his life rather than at the edge of it. He breathed the kind of breath his father had taught by example: through the nose, low, like you are considering a bolt you want to last. He looked at the van with its quiet gray and his name doing neither a shout nor a whisper, and he felt the click, that small, clean sound of agreement that you can take into any weather and rely on.Chapter 9

Spring did not arrive so much as it practiced, testing itself on small things first. The morning air had a different curve to it, a bend that let your shoulders drop before you knew why. The lemon tree had decided two fruits counted as a performance and added a third that was shy in the way green is shy. The magpie performed scales that seemed to include a joke it had made up for itself. Stafford woke into that kind of day with the ache in his forearms that meant he had been using them properly and the particular clean-mindedness that came from having nothing to apologize to the house for.

Work had taken on a new timbre now that the letters on the van had become part of the street. He noticed people notice him and tried not to give the noticing too much weight. He drove to Armstrong Creek to look at a roof where the builder had left a note with a smiley face and the words good access lol, and he refused to hate a man for writing lol in paint. The access was honest in a way a ladder is honest; there, but not for your comfort. He met the client, a woman with a braid that argued with the wind and the kind of patient humor you cultivate by having three small boys and a dog who believed all visitors were army. He stood in the street with his hand on the van and spoke about kilowatts and hours and the way a panel’s output was not a moral judgment. He did the polite dance where he talked her down from the fantasy of a selfie-ready array and into the reality of shade maps and the unruly pride of a neighbor’s gum. She nodded a lot and then asked a better question than most men did, which was what would you do if this was your roof, and he answered with a plan that would pay off in eight years and in the more immediate currency of sleeping through wind. She said she liked to sleep and he said he liked to be blamed only for things he had actually done, and they shook hands in that particular way you do when both of you have agreed to live with math.

He fell into a habit of leaving the house early enough to sit in the van around the corner with the engine off and let the day catch up. It felt like he was refusing to let his life ride him; it belonged to him for three quiet minutes before the job’s first ladder. He wrote the day’s list in his father’s book when he remembered and on the back of an envelope when he forgot, and he kept both because inconsistency stayed truer to the man he was. The notebook had begun to accrete small adhesive tabs where he had marked the pages that felt like talismans. He had written on one in pencil, soft as dust, pears and debt, and on another, you can be careful and happy at once. Sometimes he flipped them for no reason and put his finger under a line and felt, ridiculously, like someone in a film who has chosen the card that will show him his fate.

Ned drifted in and out of his days with the erratic grace of a satellite. Sometimes he landed on a job like a blessing and sometimes like weather. He started to call himself a roof-adjacent consultant in a tone that made it clear he knew how insufferable that sounded and enjoyed it anyway. Stafford liked him on rooftops because Ned had the laugh of a man who has noticed a skylight just in time and enjoys being alive enough to tell the story properly. On a job in Highton where the client wore Lycra like it was his country, Ned held a tape for him while Stafford marked rafter centers with little pencil nobility and said, “You look happier when you’re measuring than when you’re at the pub,” which was both wrong and completely true. They watched a cloud move like a suggestions list across the bay and Ned added, “You’ve got the look of someone who is going to ruin something beautiful by being careful with it until it becomes worth keeping,” and Stafford told him to go fetch the ladder like a man who accepted the compliment and folded it up under his shirt.

The training center stitched itself into his weeks without anyone having to name it. He found himself stopping by when he didn’t have an official reason, dropping off spare tags or picking up a box of out-of-date connectors for teaching purposes and then lingering with his hands on the top of a rubbish bin as if it had asked for his help. Isobel existed in that place like a keystone, the kind of presence you could test a building by. Her cough had faded into something that belonged to the weather rather than to her, though it resurfaced sometimes in the last five words of a sentence like a small punctuation. She had a way with new cohorts that Stafford admired the way you admire a tradesman you know you cannot become; she could draw a straight line between a man’s pride and his safety and make him happy about touching both with two fingers.

When she asked him to turn up on Tuesdays to scare people properly about roof edges and then stay to stand in a switchroom explaining turn off like you mean it, he said yes and then invented the term volunteer invoice in his head to make the time feel square. “You’re getting paid,” she said when he tried to suggest otherwise, not by us but by the fact you’re about to walk into four houses where the client saw your face telling them not to die, and he had to admit that there were economies without forms. He found a way to be a man at the base of ladders who remembered names and harness sizes and which person needed to be told they were doing a good job because their father had not told them that for twenty years. He became, just for the span of an afternoon, someone to be looked at instead of someone who looked, and it didn’t poison him the way he’d worried it might.

One evening after a long day of ladders and a shorter day of teaching, he stopped at the market not because he needed groceries but because the market had become a place where the town declared itself alive once a week and he liked to check. He moved through it as a way to wash work off, to let spices and shouting and the steady industry of knife men remind him that his hands were not the only hands. The barista with opinions had acquired a hat and a righteous cause in the form of a petition to save a plane tree that had done nothing but shade a car park well for sixty years. “Sign it,” she said without preamble. “You, of all people, understand the concept of something that quietly gives.” He signed without reading the copy because the tree had already done more for him than any planning document ever would, and he took his flat white with a small heat that had nothing to do with the milk.

Isobel appeared in the way people do when a street has agreed to provide them. She wore the kind of coat people buy when they have decided they know what coat suits them and intend to be that person. Her hair had argued with its own straightness and lost nicely. He watched three people recognize her across the way and he saw her field their greetings like a person whose job is a net. She came to him last as if she were letting the air decide the order and he was the time left. “I have a confession,” she announced in a tone that suggested the confession would be small and possibly edible. “I told the spare-room people about your soup and they have decided you are a person who can be fed without a risk assessment. Anthea asked whether you are a man who approves of stews involving names you can’t pronounce.”

He said he would approve of any stew that arrived at the end of a drive bounded by paddocks and stories. She nodded like a commissioner handing down a finding. “They sent you this,” she added, producing from her bag a jar of jam with a label in handwriting that had never learned to apologize. “‘Quince experiment,’” she read. “Which sounds like a late-stage band but tastes like something you’d eat out of a spoon in the middle of the night because no one could see.” He held the jar as if it might get away and promised to write a review in the form of an empty jar by next Thursday. They stood at the edge of a stall where a woman demonstrated how to wrap string around packages in ways that would make a sailor feel lazier. He was about to say something about string and knots when an older man with corrective shoes appeared at Isobel’s elbow and did that thing where he introduced himself as if the world was a panel he had been asked to sit on. He referenced the library talk and he referenced a relative’s inverter that made a sound it shouldn’t when it was bored and he referenced policy and the idea that policy was something you could iron. Isobel set her face to patient and explained feed-in limits again because patience was part of the jacket she wore to town. Stafford watched the two interact like watching two currents in a river and when the man had been gently forgiven and equipped to go away and not make another person feel small, Isobel turned back with the kind of expression that could be described as a kindness apology. “Sorry,” she said. “I attract men who think the sun is a personal attack.”

He told her about a client who had demanded that the inverter be installed somewhere he’d seen one in a brochure and how he had had to explain you cannot put a box of expensive electronics into a corner that rains sideways. She laughed and pointed her chin at a stall selling bean seeds like tiny hopes, and together they walked over because hope, packaged, is irresistible to people who like systems. She bought two packets as if choosing children. “I will kill them,” she said, folding the paper with an affection that did not disguise realism. “But we will all know I tried.” He asked where she would plant them and she said in pots near a west window because she liked at least one plant in her life to enjoy sunsets, and then her phone pinged and she became the person a ping requires for a minute and then slid back into the person who stood with a man near beans and spoke about the shape of the day.

After that the weeks changed gear in a way that quietly convinced him they had always meant to. His first real solar install without the scaffolding of a supervisor went on a tidy roof in Manifold Heights with a view of trees trained into formality and a neighbor who introduced herself with a cake and then said “You are not allowed any; it is for my grandchildren” because she understood boundaries. He laid rails with the prayer-like attention his hands had started to say all on their own. Each clamp clicked in that sound that had grown up in his brain like a word learned late and made into a favorite. He ran wire as if future electricians would have to read his sentences. When the app reported the system breathing in green and the client called her husband to speak to the phone like a man had rung from a war, he held himself back from doing a small show with his hands. That night he washed in the laundry sink with water that had seen more paint than skin and sat on the back step with his shirt off and his back making its opinions known and felt the kind of tired that is salary.

His mother continued to make small interjections into his schedule like a person reminding a metronome it was a device for people not machines. She asked him to fix a cupboard door that refused to consider its hinges, and he did the job with a screwdriver he’d taken from his father’s crate as if tightening the door would somehow persuade June evenings to be warmer. She listened to his stories about roofs and ladders and people who apologized to their tiny dogs for being out when they rang on a doorbell, and then she said, as she wiped the sink with a reverence that had nothing to do with the sink, “You’re good,” like an observation, not a prayer. He said he was trying to be and she said, “You were always going to be, even if you were bad for a while,” and he carried that sentence into the car like a jar of something to be opened in hunger.

He found himself thinking about money in a way that felt like taking a deep breath. The business had become a business in the sense that his mornings included more phone calls where he wrote things down without rolling his eyes at himself. He rang a supplier and negotiated as if talking about bulk rates was a way to confess you wanted a future. He called the DNSP and waited on hold through a chorus of the world’s most offended cello while looking at a photo of rails in his phone and feeling his own faith. He said no to a job where a man had suggested an inverter brand because a cousin-of-a-cousin had gotten a “deal” off the back of a truck and he said it not with moral panic but with the calm of a person who knows what happens when plastic chooses smoke, and the man had, shockingly, taken it. He walked out of that house with money unearned and a note in his book that said trust your no, and he felt the kind of lightness that only comes when you walk away from a bargain that would have broken you for a day.

Isobel existed both at the center and the edge of his life, a gravitational quirk he did not pretend to understand. They texted with the respectfulness that people who have decided not to puncture an atmospheric balance reserve for rare and useful sentences. He sent a photograph of a switchroom that had been labeled in a previous generation with a calligraphic care to make a man cry, and she sent a photograph of a student’s cable run that contained a bend so elegant it could have made money in a gallery. She asked him if he had ever taught someone who resisted competence because competence felt like an admission, and he replied yes and added a story about a young man who had finally stopped breaking screws when he realized you can stop at tight and not push on into virtue. Sometimes their messages were trivialities that felt like a way of proving you could make a living out of small things. Sometimes there was nothing for days, not because of a fight but because their lives had both acquired momentum and to drag them into a conversation would have been to be unkind.

One afternoon, she called without pretext and his stomach did the courtesy of behaving. It was a practical reason: she had been asked to look at a roof near Queenscliff that had seemed straightforward and then had refused to behave. “Come and be the man who stares before moving,” she said. “It’s a heritage place that has Opinions. It will not respect our opinions unless we go together and carry the air of consensus.” He said he could go now if “now” included thirty minutes for leading a man away from the idea that his pergola could support a car. She said thirty was a luxury and he decided to believe her.

The house stood near the river in that posture old houses have when they have stood through too many fashions and been forced to choose dignity. The roof was slate, old and cranial, with delicate edges that had been put on by men who assumed men would always put on things that carefully. The owners were an older couple who wore their clothes like a good sentence: clear, without apology. The man had a way of shifting his weight during a sentence that suggested a youth spent arguing with ideas, and the woman watched them both with eyes that had catalogued a thousand men and kept only the good ones. Isobel was careful with them; she had learned how to talk to old houses without making their owners feel old. She led them around to the back where the roof had a modern add-on and spoke about the difference between touching something and leaning on it. Stafford went up a ladder cautiously because slate is the kind of surface that has a memory for disrespect. He moved along purlins as if performing a hymn and put his hand down the way you pat a dog you have not been introduced to. He saw where someone had tried to kind a fix for a skylight thirty years ago and how that kindness had cracked. He came down with the kind of closing sentences a roof prefers and delivered them like weather: the new array could not live on the old head but the extension was strong as a decision and could hold a smaller version of their dream. He did the math in his book with a stub of pencil because pencil feels like an ancient tool in a modern friction, and the numbers grew toward an answer the couple could live with. The man said something about compromise and how it is a filthy word until you start to honor it, and Isobel nodded as if they had done the work of a day by saying that alone.

They stood under a bottlebrush that had decided all it could offer the world was red and made the most of it. Isobel pushed her hair behind her ear in that absent-minded way he had become overfamiliar with in his head and then arrested her hand like it had been told it was betraying her. “Do you think about leaving?” the woman asked, as if it were normal to ask a man you had just met whether he ever imagined walking away from a town shaped like a plough. Stafford said sometimes he thought of the west, the kind of heat that taught you to reorganize your day, or the north where he had no rights, but then he could not imagine a magpie that would not have his tree or a lemon that would not look him in the eye. “Then don’t,” the man said, as if the question had never been as complicated as Stafford had believed. Isobel coughed the short cough she coughed when her mind was elsewhere and said, “I tried once,” and the couple looked at her with that hungry friendliness older people have for the possibility of anyone doing a brave thing, and then the woman said, “Well you’re here now,” and Isobel said, “I am,” and Stafford stood very still between sentences and the thought that perhaps the idea of leaving is a way to make staying more yours.

The job that followed that visit was the kind that takes your neatness and asks whether it can bear weight. A small brick place near Newcomb wanted to be a little less at the mercy of a bill, and the man who lived there had a face that had seen sun more than arguments. The rafters did not sit where rafters should sit, and the conduits had had lives of their own and wanted to continue. He called Ned for a second pair of eyes and got his first, because Ned arrived with a pair of safety glasses atop his head like a crown and an opinion about rafters that made the house blush. They found a way through that did not injure the roof or their self-respect. They installed a modest string with the same love they would have lavished on a roof with a view and a budget, because love was a habit and not a tariff. The man stood underneath while they finished and told them about his grandsons and how one had decided to be a pastry chef because butter had been kind to him, and when the green light came on it was almost not about the light, it was about the fact the man had been given a sentence to say to his grandsons about what he had done for them. They drank the tea he made with water that had boiled too hard and left with the satisfaction that comes when a house gives you its name because you have done right by it.

One night, unexpectedly and without the publicness that would have made it a fact, he found himself invited into Isobel’s other life. She texted him a pin and the words bring your forearms if you have them, which could have been code and was not. He followed the map to a hall that had once been a Scout den and had now become the practice space for a ragtag of people who believed music was a form of shelter. She was at the back of the room with her scarf thrown over a chair and a violin in her hand like it had been part of her body at a cellular level. He had never asked if she played anything because it felt like asking a house whether it minded rain. She did not see him at first because she was tuning, which is not something you do with your ears so much as with your mouth set a certain way. The group stopped its chatter, the conductor, a skinny man who looked like he had grown a bit around a baton, lifted his hand and the room began to obey. The music that came was not profound in the way symphonies are profound but something happened anyway; a coherence gathered itself, a small city being made in air. Isobel’s mouth didn’t move but her eyebrows had a life, and her bow decided how the piece felt in the room. When they finished and the conductor nodded at them like he had been fed, the group fell into laughter like men climbing down ladders, and Isobel finally turned and saw him and did not seem surprised, which felt like a gift.

He helped stack chairs because that is what you do when you are grateful to have been shown a door. They walked out into a night with a moon that had got above its station and he said nothing about the music until she did. “We do this because it keeps us in our bodies,” she said. “Otherwise we become heads on legs explaining the world to each other. The world does not require our commentary as often as we think.” He told her his father had tapped his foot to music the way a man tests a stud, and she laughed with her teeth, which happened less often than it should have. They stood by the hatchback again because cars had become the stage where they stopped caching themselves. “I have tests next week,” she said, as if telling him about a service appointment for the car, and then her mouth did that small twist that preceded honesty. “It’s nothing and it’s probably everything,” she continued casually. “They like to look at lungs when you’ve been coughing to prove a point. I have not been coughing a point for weeks and yet we do maintenance because we are grown.” He sat with the sentence for a second, practiced not putting hands where they weren’t wanted, and then managed, only, “Tell me when talking is a useful thing and when silence is more useful,” and she nodded in relief that he had understood the form.

On the day of the tests he cut wire and mounted rails and did everything slower on purpose so as not to mistake the feeling of power for something else. He avoided the news because hospitals were their own country and the internet did not report honestly from that border. In the late afternoon his phone buzzed with a sentence stripped of adjectives: lungs are fine, the rest of me is tired; this story is administrative. He leaned his head against a brick wall as if it had reverted to an old purpose of being leaned on and wrote back three words: good, thank you, rest, and then four more which he deleted because you do not give a person advice on breathing when their lungs have just been declared an empire.

He took the jar back to Ballan on a day with light like polished ash. Anthea scolded him for washing it too well because jars prefer to inherit stories. He carried in a screwdriver because the back door would forever have a screw that tried to talk itself loose, and he enjoyed the ritual of tightening it while the kettle made the kitchen smell like old happiness. The man, whose name turned out to be Lachlan in the way names reveal themselves when you start to know where a person keeps their spoons, showed him a small solar-powered thing he had installed on the chook shed as if it were a proof of faith. He stood in the yard and listened to the way the wind came through the trees at that angle and he thought that the difference between here and home was not big enough to deserve the gravity they sometimes gave it.

On a Tuesday a boy came into the training yard with a chip on his shoulder so pronounced it looked medically interesting. He put on a harness like a dare and looked at Stafford with the empty face of someone who has not been praised without trap. Stafford showed him where to put the strap through the buckle twice and the boy nodded without looking and then did it wrong in a new way. He took the boy’s hands gently like you handle an animal you want to keep and threaded the buckle properly and said, “I need you to not die on me because I don’t want your mother to have to learn my name,” and the boy’s mouth did that little fight thing and then stopped. He made him walk the edge with the harness singing its quiet song and he made him put a boot where the steel was and then praised him without party and the boy softened around the eyes the way men do when they are safe without having to say it. He saw Isobel at the other end of the yard catching a different boy, one who had never thought about falling because he could not imagine being held, and he watched her speak to him with a science he never expected to learn and did, slowly, by being near it.

One evening Ned insisted on celebrating the new van letters at a pub where men in polo shirts pretended this was not their third night in a row. “You look like a proper thing,” Ned said, banging a glass on the table to make the chips jump. “Your father would have told you to stop looking at your own name like it owed you money, but he would have been smug in the way men are smug when nothing in their bodies changes but everything in the room does.” Stafford accepted the tribute and the needling in one mouthful and told Ned about the heritage roof, about Ballan as an idea, about the boy and the buckle, and Ned nodded like a man listening to a mate describe the construction of a usable chair out of a single plank. “You’re building a life the way my dad used to sharpen planes,” he said. “Slowly, on purpose, always in the same motion, even when no one is looking. It will either make you unbearable or it will make you the man everyone calls when the hinges squeal. My money is on hinges.”

Spring turned up with noise after all. The wind decided to be a feature rather than a fact. A storm came through of the kind that teaches roofs humility. He drove to a house that had called at seven with the special tension of a voice that stands under water where water should not be. He arrived to find a river that had chosen an indoor route and made itself at home in a lounge room rug. He climbed a roof under rain because sometimes you are the person who does and sometimes you lie to yourself and say someone else will. He found a piece of sheeting that had pretended to be fixed and was not, and he put his shoulder against weather and got the rope into the right place and made knots that would have won prizes with people he did not want to meet. He came down and stood in a kitchen that smelled like wet and said words that did not erase anything but made a map. The woman looked smaller and then not small and put both hands flat on the bench like prayer. “Thank you,” she said with that rawness of a person who is not performing for a church, and he said you’re fine in a tone he used like a tool, because fine was a spell if you said it correctly.

He went home wet to skin and put his clothes in the machine as if he were packing a patient into warm blankets. The lemon tree shook off what it had been given and the magpie looked offended and then decided offense was too much effort. He slept for twenty minutes sitting up without asking his body if it minded. He woke to a text from Isobel that said, Did your conscience get caught on a roof today? We just had three men misidentify a skylight as ‘safe-looking,’ and he sent her a photograph of the knot he had made and she sent back the right name for it because she collected names the way other people collected coins. The next day at the center he stood in front of the group and told them about water, which is fundamentally a risk manager with a PhD, and he made them touch the edges of skylights with their knuckles rather than their palms and he watched quiet fall on young men like weather.

It took longer than it should have for him to notice that his life had grown routines that made him someone else: the habit of checking his email before seven because professional men do that, the way his boots took a particular position by the door, how the jars in the cupboard arranged themselves without his help now that jars had become letters between people. Anthea sent him a jar with walnuts in syrup and a note that said this is only a dessert if you know what you’re doing with cream, otherwise it is breakfast, and he ate it at both times and had no shame. His mother asked if he was eating and he said he was eating walnuts in syrup and she said he was on the verge of becoming a man who has opinions about yogurt and he said he had always secretly been that man. His father’s notebook collected more penciled notes in a hand that was not his father’s and yet sometimes, if you didn’t look straight at it, could be.

He went to the footy once more with Ned and did not tell Isobel because it felt like the kind of thing that did not require sharing in order for it to count. They watched a game that looked winnable and then stopped looking winnable and then, miraculously, was, and they laughed into the cold air like men on school holidays. On the walk back to the car he saw three vans with names and numbers and fonts that tried too hard and he looked at his gray and felt relief and irritation with himself for caring. He sat in the driver’s seat and put his hand on the wheel at seven and held it like a hand you can trust.

There were failures, and he let them have their due. He cracked a tile and saw it too late and did the walk of a man with a replacement in his hand and honesty ready in his mouth. He misread a network’s note and ran a cable twice because he had imagined the path better than he had listened to the wall. He was blunt with a man who wanted to add panels without respecting strings and then regretted his tone, and called to apologize to a voicemail because pride is a poorer accompaniment to sleep than humility. He put a bolt where a bolt should not be and then felt it in his palm for two days as if regret could be absorbed through skin.

He kept turning up. That was the work more than the wires and the bolts and the neat squares of switchboards he could line up like teeth. He stood at the base of ladders and at the edge of roofs and in kitchens still smelling of storm and at his mother’s sink and in the training yard with hands in his pockets so he wouldn’t point more than he should. He walked into Isobel’s office sometimes when she was not there and looked at the things on the desk—not invasively, just with the quiet inventory of a man who totted up his respect—and he would place a flag or a tag in a way she would recognize as his and leave. Once he left a lemon in the middle of a piece of paper and wrote under it in tiny letters insurance, and when she messaged him a photograph of it later she added, Only a man from Geelong West would confuse fruit with policy. He replied, Only a woman from Highton would accept both, and they left it there because sometimes wit was how you cooled a room down without turning off the heat.

If there was a line, he continued to see it from the correct side and to respect his own hunger by not feeding it the wrong food. He ate soup and walnuts and cake he was not supposed to eat and pie from Ballan and the kind of bread markets make everyone buy. He looked at her hands on a violin and at a clipboard and at a coil of rope and did not look too long. He told himself stories when he could not sleep, but they had changed shape slightly; they were less about rooms he had built with words and more about the fact of rooms being justified by work. He wrote a sentence at the back of his father’s notebook one night, with the light low and the magpie asleep somewhere not spiritual at all: do not ask for the world to answer, just set the screws by feel until the timber says thank you. He underlined it because he is the sort of man now who underlines something because he can.

On a warm Thursday that had the smell of mown optimism, he put on his harness for a job that was almost too easy and said out loud, to no one, “Stay on the steel,” out of habit or superstition or the long, slow muscle moved by care. When the click came—the right kind of click—he smiled by himself on a roof with the bay throwing a blue that made roofs feel like a personal project, and he lifted his hand and placed the connector like a blessing and felt again the small agreement that had become his measure for whether a day had done its job. He stood up and let the wind press against his jacket like a mate with an opinion, and he looked toward the You Yangs and thought, not for the first time and not for the last, that he had built something worth opening the door for each morning, even if some days all he had to show for it was lemon scent on his hands and a magpie with thoughts, and that this, too, could be a whole life if you tightened each bolt with a little love and let people be people at their own chosen distances.
