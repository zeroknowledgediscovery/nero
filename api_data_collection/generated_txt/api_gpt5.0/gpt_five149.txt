They crowned me beneath a ceiling painted with tame constellations, stars with names of gentlemen I’d never met. The ceiling had been hammered flat in my great-grandmother’s reign, before we learned how to press gold leaf thin enough to tremble when the doors opened. It trembled that morning as frost rattled in. Trumpets did their proud coughing. Men in their silk collars submitted themselves to pageantry as if it were a soothing bath.

The Book of Oaths slid heavy onto my palms. It is a man’s book, they say, not because men wrote it—though they did—but because it is shaped like a door that only ever opens inward. I held it anyway. My shadow moved over the stippled letters as the High Recorder droned on. His voice is the voice of dinner knives politely chafing together.

“By your name—Maelin of Glass, Maelin of the Ninth House, Maelin who was a daughter, who is now a mother to law—”

They like to call me mother to law. It makes the men softer around the eyes. It lets them say, without saying, that a mother wouldn’t break her sons. Somewhere on my left, Lord Consort Hadran Vale, my step-father, breathed in so carefully that it made a sound like silk waking. He gives me that, the carefulness. He never clears his throat. He never spills.

I remember the first time I saw him. He stood in our rain-bent orchard in a coat the color of ink just before it decides it will be ocean. I was nine. My mother clasped his weathered hand and looked at him as if he were sleep finally arrived. He bowed to me and didn’t look away first. Brown eyes. The exact brown of a root you’ve just cut clean.

They crowned me and I smiled and the ceiling trembled. I should set it down plainly (plainly never seems to be enough): men make the rules. They draft them, in rooms with frosted glass and long tables, in hands with ink-stained nails, with pens whose nibs bite the page as gently as minnows. They are harmless by decree and design, and not only by decree, but—then I am skipping ahead. Put a finger here. Don’t lose the place.

After the trumpets and the knives passed through their throat-clearing, there was the hall, and the walk that pretends to be easy. Hadran fell into step beside me, a small step behind in the way of consorts, his arm bent but not offered, because touching me in public would conflate us, and nothing is more dangerous to both of us than an easy conflation.

“You kept your hands steady,” he murmured without moving his mouth. He does that, speaking out of a stillness so pure you could think you heard him with your skin.

“I am not a child,” I said. My voice, obedient as a hawk.

“I remember,” he said. “I am the one who remembers it.”

We reached the end of the hall where the wind drops itself like a dog at your feet. The doors to the East Gallery opened with a breath that smelled of juniper needles and iron. The crowd—lace and plumage and opinions—bowed and folded. Hadran didn’t show his teeth when he smiled. He seldom does. His kindness is meant to be felt, not seen.

I took my place at the head of the longest table in the realm. It was polished so well I could see the ceiling’s fake stars inside the wood. The gentlemen of the low courts sat in ranks, their mother-of-pearl cufflinks palming light. The Mothers of Law—women with braids like ropes over their shoulders—stood at the walls. It is the men’s task to draft. It is ours to enforce. We are the hand that signs and the hand that steadies the blade that cuts bread, not throats. There is comfort, or so they say, in that division.

“Your Majesty,” said the High Recorder, already happy on the taste of the words, “the Council of Gentlemen awaits your assent to the winter schedule.”

I nodded. He looked at my nod the way a man looks at the sky and decides not to take a coat.

“Bring the schedule.”

Paper made its small sea-shore noises. Beside me, Hadran’s fingertip tapped once, as if to say, Count.

A boy—man enough by the law to vote on walnuts—brought the schedule up to me. He flinched as when a moth chooses you. I was not offended.

“What is your name?” I asked.

“M-me? Carrin, Ma’am.” His ears, pink. A smudge of graphite at the bend of his wrist, the way scriveners sometimes carry their work home on their skin.

“Carrin,” I said. “If you were the one to choose, would we move the market in frostweek or hold it?”

Contrary to the halls’ belief, I like to ask questions that the Book of Oaths never imagined asking. He looked towards the Recorder without moving his head, as if the world were a table and the answer were a pepper pot he couldn’t reach.

“I suppose hold it, Ma’am.” And then, because he has been trained in the carefulness that keeps him alive: “Unless it isn’t wise.”

“It might be unkind,” I said. “Which is worse than unwise, sometimes.”

The Mothers of Law shifted their weight at the walls in a small, respectful wave. Hadran’s finger tapped my sleeve once. He would later, in the quiet room behind the tapestry, tell me the tradesmen could stand one more week of frost, that the canals were locked and letting the barges wait would force the salt into the city in a way that made the prices kinder in the low ovens. But then, before the tapestries, I am still in the chair, with a crown that thinks it is a little sun.

I signed. I assented. I did the work that looks like blessing. When the hall let me go, Hadran walked with me down the corridor where the tapestries think, night and day, that they are forests. Behind the woven leaves, a narrow door, a narrow room, a table just big enough to hold four hands.

“You were merciful,” he said. It was not praise.

“You were counting barges,” I said. It looks like a question. It wasn’t.

“I am always counting something,” Hadran said, and smiled his woolen smile. “Today it is barges and the time it takes for an apple barrel to sour in the dark. Yesterday it was how many steps you could take in that dress without stumbling. For the record: thirty.”

“Thirty-two,” I said, because it is necessary to win a little at everything that is only a game.

He poured wine, then didn’t drink. He hates it, the sweetness of it; it sticks to his tongue. But he pours it anyway because it is another thing to hold that isn't a wrist.

“Did you see the boy?” I asked.

He had. He sees everyone. “Carrin. His mother is a candle-maker. His father made pipes for the city before the Quiet. The boy holds his pen like a pipe, which is why his wrist looks wrong.”

I don’t know that I should say it here. I will anyway. The Quiet is the word we use to soften the story, as if covering a blade with velvet makes it less a blade. Two centuries ago—some say three, but the Book takes a different view—the Weavers took the riot and the roar and wove it. They did something to the blood of men, not only to the blood but to the blue of the thinking. They made a vow in the mouths of all the men at once, a vow worded to catch every sharpness. From then on, men could not strike with intent. They could not lay a hand with harm in it. They could write, and they did, and do. They could love, and they did, and do. But to lift a fist with the idea of hurting? It curdled in their elbows. It never reached the knuckles.

Some people call this mercy. Hadran calls it a rope padded with roses. Others call it a miracle. The Book of Oaths uses the word Gift, because a gift can be returned, one day, if you find the receipt.

When I was ten, a boy at the fountain put his palm on my forehead and told me I would be queen of nothing. He did it kindly. His mother spanked his hand with the corner of her shawl for touching a Glass girl, and he blinked up at me surprised, because he meant it as sweetness. We are a people, now, who do not know which touch is allowed and which remembered.

We drank the wine we didn't want. Hadran told me about canals; I told him about a robin I’d seen on the palace roof that wintered here rather than going south. Slowly, we unfastened our voices and put on our other clothing. If you have never worn power thick as wool in summer, you don’t know how good it is to be naked in a quiet room.

I would have stayed there, in that narrow untime, if the Anchoress hadn’t sent for me. She sent a string with ten knots. She tied it in the mouth of a dead hare and left it at the palace gate. The gate guard carried it in with two fingers and the kind of face that thinks: I am going to name every god I know in case names are nets.

“She’s in the Chapel-of-Not,” said Captain Sera Bryn, one of my Mothers, a woman whose hair is the color of burnt bread and whose humor is a well in drought. “Do you want an escort?”

“Do I need one?” I asked.

“It depends,” Sera said, “on if you want to feel lonely.”

I did not. “Come,” I said.

Hadran watched us go the way a boat watches a log decide it will be river again. He kissed the top of my head and that is called tenderness, and it is. It is. I am writing it down so I will not forget that on the afternoon my fate turned from one street into another, he rested his mouth on my hair as if I were the last warm loaf in winter.

The Chapel-of-Not is barely a chapel. It was a staircase once, a secret one, between the Prince’s Room and the room where they salted beef. They walled the stairs up, then changed their minds, then changed them again, and by then the stairs were weary of all that, so they slumped into a room that has a window for kneeling and a window for standing up straight. The Anchoress made her house in that slump. She taped bits of paper on the walls with fish glue, she hung bones in strings, she made the room smell like fennel and pepper and old dreams.

“Your Majesty,” she said, with the smile of a woman who remembers you were eight and came to steal cloves, grinding them between your teeth so your breath would be kind enough for the cats. “Shut the door.”

“If I shut it,” I said, “the mothers will break it down if you make a wrong sound.”

“I am glad of that,” she said. “People who are written into worldbooks should never be alone with me.”

“It’s not a worldbook,” I said. “It’s precisely not a worldbook. The world would never fit.”

She licked her finger and snuffed a lamp. The light dimmed and did not complain.

“You shouldn’t have sent the hare,” I said. “The gate boy will not sleep until the thaw.”

“I wanted you to come quickly.”

“I was enthroned.”

“I know,” she said, with a shrug that would have been disrespect if she had meant it. “There is a problem only a queen can solve.”

I could feel Sera draw herself up behind me, a cord pulled tighter. “There are a great many problems,” Sera said, “that only a queen can solve. Why is this one… pressing.”

“Because,” said the Anchoress Light-of-Not, “if she does not solve it by the end of frost, there will be no men in Harrowshore, and by the end of thaw, no men in the Twined Counties, and before the rife-bloom, none in the Seven Quarters. And before the summer water comes—”

“You could say it more plainly,” I said. “There is a rhythm in doom that doesn’t make it less.”

“Your step-father,” she said. “You have to kill Hadran.”

Captain Sera made the sound a bowstring makes before it is sure if it will be arrow or lute. She shifted her weight on the boards, which told the room how they felt about being shifted upon.

“No,” I said. My throat remembered milk. “No."

“I will tell you what I saw.” The Anchoress never tells what she hasn’t seen. She is not a pyramid of rumors. She is a person who has ropes tied to the things you don’t see until they come knocking.

“You don’t need to,” I said. “I say no. I hold the saying.”

She touched the string of bones that hung in the chapel—mice and small birds and the jaw of something that used to know how to dig. The bones clicked with a sound the kind of women who unmake nets would make with the tongues.

“If you do not kill your step-father,” she said, “he will return the Gift.”

“They call it the Quiet,” Sera said, flat.

“Yes,” said the Anchoress. “Stone it, sand it, name it, soften it with bread and light. It is a rope, and he plans to cut it in a way that will spill blood backward into the past. Men will be wild in memory again. The old lawmakers will fill their lungs, and all our mothers will have to go to the river, and the river will be very thirsty.”

“Wild?” I said. A stupid word. I knew it. I couldn’t think of another one, there in the thin room with the bones and the smell of cardamom. “You’re telling me that men will—”

“Remember,” she said. “Not become something they never were. Remember. There will be strikes. There will be greed with fists. There will be the old games where winners were left with blood on their teeth. There will be boys who never learn to put down a rock.”

I wanted to laugh. I did not. I have never been able to perceive something that large and laugh without choking. “And only a queen can—”

“Only you can. He loves you.”

“Not enough to—”

“Enough that he won’t guard against you.”

“Enough?” I made a little hinge of my hands.

“Put it like this,” she said. “If Sera here wants to stick a knife in Hadran, the whole city will know it. Every window will breathe in. Every cat will look at the door and find culture in it. If you want to put one in him, there is a window somewhere that will not seat a cat, and a door that won’t creak, and a moment he will pretend not to see, to be swallowed by it. He will let you kill him if you bring him the right story.”

Sera said, “We do not plan regicide on knot-strings and old soup.”

I said, “We do not kill men. It’s in the Book and under the bed.”

The Anchoress hung more of her weight on the bones of small birds, which swayed as if in mild wind. “You do not kill them because they cannot kill you. The Book is a field of flowers in a world that built a fence. I am telling you: the fence is about to be gone. The field will be whatever the weather wants.”

“I won’t do it,” I said. I rarely use the childish pieces of speech. I took this one out and put it down between us like a plate. “Find another door. Give me a key that isn’t a nail.”

There are a few lies the Anchoress will permit herself to comfort children. She did not put one between my hands. Instead, she said, “He has started already.”

The room leaned. “What did you see.”

She told me about a room in the Men’s Court that was no longer a room because a floor remembers what is beneath it as a tooth remembers the root. She saw him there with the Weavers—or the not-Weavers, the ones who have taken the word and hung knives on it. She saw him bring a book that is not written in words, but in a pattern of absence. She saw him cut himself and smile, which is not possible, which is not allowed, which is not him, which—is that hung there like a coat.

Sera’s hand went to her knife and stayed on the hilt and made no further decision. “He cut himself?”

“He called it a test,” said the Anchoress. “He said, ‘It is not that we are harmless. It is that we have been prevented from acting.’ He said, ‘A harmless man makes no laws. A harmless law is not obeyed.’ He said—”

I put my hand up. You can drown in the words you imagined you heard a loved one say. They fill the nose. They clutch the throat.

“I need to see it,” I said. “I don’t mean blood. I mean the room.”

“You cannot look at the room,” said Sera. “If it exists, it is folded behind the men who write the rules. It is made to be not seen by us with our own eyes.”

“Bring me a boy who saw it,” I said.

“Who would tell you?” Sera asked. “Who could? He would break his mother’s heart and his own teeth. The Quiet has other edges, Majesty. It makes men unable to speak of certain harms as it makes them unable to do others. Ask a fish about water. He will tell you it is the thing that holds him from falling into air.”

“Carrin,” I said; badly said; grasping. “He watched as I signed the schedule. He had graphite on his wrist. He had a mother with wax on her hands. If he is even near that room—”

“You want to use the boy as a proof,” Hadran said. Not in the chapel. Behind me, but not him. It is how he works—his words will arrive in your thinking as if they sit at your table.

I am not making that up. There are people who can move into your thinking like a cat finds a lap. You only notice when your legs are asleep.

I walked out of the Chapel-of-Not with Sera at my heel, her boots deciding which boards would squeak in future. On the way back to the East Gallery, I looked in the certain way and a page appeared. Sera dismissed him with a glance. She knows how not to be seen while standing in the middle of everything.

“Bring me Carrin, the scrivener from the low bench,” I said. “Tell him his mother’s beeswax hardens too fast—it might not be safe to light his candles.”

It is always good to ask a boy to protect his mother. He will come faster if you tell him she needs him than if you tell him his queen does.

He came. He had combed his hair so severely it looked like an apology. He brought his pen, because it is no use telling a hand to leave its habit at home.

“You sent for me?” he said, looking at my knees, which is what they have been taught to do.

“I did,” I said. “Because I need help. Not with words.”

“Oh,” he said, faint disappointment, as if the teeth he had unjustly aimed at glory had all turned back to bread.

“With fear,” I said.

He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I can help with some of that.”

Sera made a small sound. It could have been a laugh if she had remembered to put it in a dress.

“I’m going to ask you a question,” I said. “You can answer yes or no. You can lie if you like, and I won’t punish you. But if you lie to me now, you will be lying to your mother more than to me.”

He blinked. The graphite smudge on his wrist looked like a shadow of a bird that had flown over him this morning.

“Have you been in a room where the Gentlemen bring books they won’t admit exist?”

He swallowed. “Are there rooms like that?”

“Yes,” I said.

“No,” he said, then, “Not— No.”

The negative got stuck on his tongue. His eyes looked at the floorboards the way some boys look at lakes, measuring whether they can reach the rock without drowning. His hand touched his wrist, and the smudge darkened.

“You won’t be punished,” I said. “Not by me.”

“It isn’t that,” he said. “I can’t find it. I mean— I was supposed to bring a kettle one day. I heard a sound like salt pouring, you know? And I opened a door that shouldn’t have been a door it was wall yesterday and— and there was a stair, only I couldn’t see any steps. I climbed it by putting my feet on the thought of a rung. I know that doesn’t sound— It’s not— Anyway, I brought the kettle to the top and I left it by the door because there was light there like when my mother burns bay leaves, a green light that looks like you might smell it. There were voices. I only— I heard my father’s name."

He had to swallow again. “He’s dead since the last thaw.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, and meant it. There is a kind of sorry that fits like a ring. The other kinds are too loose.

“It’s all right,” he said, because we teach them to say that. “Anyway. I heard his name, so I stood there a moment more and then someone—I think it was Lord Vale—said something I didn’t want to hear because it felt wrong, like a math problem with your cousin’s name in it. I put my hand on the handle and it burned me, so I dropped the kettle. It made a sound like it was going to say my name and then I ran.”

Sera’s breath was a grip. She didn’t know she was gripping, but I did, because I heard the wood under her boots change its mind.

“What did Lord Vale say?” I asked, very gently, because gentleness is the only key that sometimes coaxes words out of the places that have rust on the hinges.

Carrin’s face did a thing that faces do when they are trying to be grown men and are also still sons. “He said, 'A man who knows he cannot do harm will think harm is beneath him. A man who knows he can do harm will sometimes choose not to.' And then somebody laughed, and then the kettle burned my hand. I—” He looked down. His palm was smooth. Unscarred. The way a palm looks when it has healed on the wrong day.

“Thank you,” I said. “Go home to your mother. Tell her I will send a man to fix her gate.”

“I’ll do it,” he said, as if gates were something he learned to love this morning. He turned and then remembered something and turned back and bowed so fast he might have knocked a bead loose from the curtain.

“Good boy,” said Sera, but when he’d gone. “Now what?”

“Now we go down and walk into a wall,” I said. “Now I test if the rope is already fraying.”

“You can’t go into their rooms,” Sera said. “This is not your wall to walk into. There are men behind some doors who have made it their work to make doors forget their duty.”

“Then we’ll make the door remember,” I said. “Get me a Weaver.”

“Which one?” Sera asked, with the kind of question in it that says: there are no more Weavers who call themselves that without making a joke.

“Tyne. Widow Tyne,” I said. “She does not like the name you tried to give her. She knows how to tie water to air with thread.”

“She lives at the end of a street that does not want to be found.”

“All the best people do,” I said. “Take me.”

Sera rubbed her thumbnail against the knife-hilt the way a singer clears her throat. “If this is a thing, if this is real, if the men are—”

“Don’t,” I said. “Don’t say wild. Don’t say dangerous. Don’t put that shape into the air. The Quiet was not only a net. It was a story. You break a net with knives. You break a story with another story.”

We went out the rear gate in plain cloaks. I am not very good at plainness. I can do it until I have to speak. Then the doors all bow, and a child with a jam hand points and says, That’s the queen, and his mother says, No it isn’t, and that is the trick of it: to be unbelievable where you are not supposed to be.

Tyne’s street was gray with thawed snow. The roofs leaned on one another. Dogs had conversations diagonally across the road that had more meaning in them than most Councils sit through. Tyne’s door was green. She had painted it with her left hand, and it showed, a wandering brush, a drip like a tear that is pleased with itself.

She opened the door before we knocked. “Your Majesty,” she said, with a tongue on those words as if they were a slightly bitter fruit. “You brought me a soldier.”

“I brought myself a woman who can make rooms tell the truth,” I said.

“If I could do that, I would be something else,” Tyne said. “Tea?”

We drank it as if it were all the courage there is. It isn’t, but tea pretends.

When I told her the story, she sat back in her creaking chair and shook her head slowly, as if her neck was winding up to say something hard.

“There are not-Weavers,” she said. “They take our knots and turn them to locks. They always say it's in the service of civilization. They call themselves Lace. Do you know why they call themselves that?”

“Because lace is beautiful,” Sera said.

“Because lace is a net that looks like a decoration,” Tyne said. “It is a trap that calls itself a tablecloth. If Hadran is with them—”

“He is with them,” I said, and felt my throat receive a small, cold stone. It sat there. It took up space.

“We cannot let the rope be cut,” Tyne said, “if only because the rope holds so many stories you and I were born under. The men—” She glanced at my face and changed the word. “The boys. I remember my brother trying to kill a spider. He cried because he couldn’t crush it. He had a mouth full of salt because of it. He was ashamed, and that is a net too. Shame. They put it over him, and he smiled through it all his life."

“I need to see the room,” I said. “I can’t lift a knife until I see the floor I may have to drop it on.”

Tyne stood, which is not an action of hers that tends to happen. She prefers her work done with the least amount of moving of the bones. “All right,” she said. “I will make a door forget itself for you. I will make a hinge remember a song it liked when it was a tree. But you have to pay me.”

“In gold?” Sera said.

Tyne laughed, a bark, the honest kind. “Don’t insult me. In confession.”

I have kept the habits my mother taught me: do not promise what you cannot afford to give.

“What confession?” I asked.

“The smallest true thing you have never said aloud.”

I thought of the time I let Ada, my sister, fall down the root cellar steps and then told my mother we slipped. It is the old kind of true. The confessions have to be newer to be of use in magic. And it came, out of my mouth as if a fish had chosen it: “I thought once about letting the crown pass me. I thought if I put my hair under a boy’s pillow a moth would eat it and I could be someone’s aunt.”

Tyne’s mouth opened. You don’t often see surprise in a woman who has made rooms tell the truth for bread. “That will do,” she said, and reached without looking behind her to take a length of string off a hook.

We went to the Men’s Court at an hour when no one pretends to be pure. The lamps made little gold wells along the corridor. There were no guards. That is a kind of guard. Tyne found the wall. She put her ear to it and hummed. It is a song that makes you think of baking. Then she tied three knots, then two, then one, then she put the string in my palm and closed my fingers over it.

“Pull,” she said.

I did. The wall resisted, not the way a door resists, but the way a person who loves you argues because they want you to stay in.

“Again.”

I pulled. It was like giving birth to a thing that is made of wood. Sera swore softly, reverently. The stone softened, it bent, the door that was a wall exhaled, shivered, and then admitted itself.

We went up the stair that was not a stair, putting our feet on the thought of climbing. When we reached the top, Tyne put her hand on my mouth and I didn’t bite it. We had agreed before we took a breath that if we found a room, we would not speak in it unless we wanted to speak to the room.

There was a room. It had a shape that remembered another shape. There was a table and three books that were not books, but their absence weighted the air. There was a smell like bay leaves burned in a kettle. There was a stain on the floor the exact size and shape of a hand that had held fear for a long time and finally let it go. I put my hand over it. My hand is not any bigger than that. It is the exact coin.

Sera inhaled and held it. Her eyes met mine and told me another story: if we are caught, I will claim we came because I wanted to see if the cleaning boys do their job.

And there, on the far wall, was a piece of glass. Not a mirror. Mirrors give themselves. Glass just sits there and pretends it is not a surface. In the glass, a memory of a man’s face, my mother’s husband’s, no, not his face, the space where that face had been. I reached toward it. Tyne took my wrist. She shook her head once.

I nodded. We left. The stair was more stair than thoughts now. The wall was more wall. The string in my palm had become ordinary again, scratch and salt.

In the corridor, Sera let breath happen. “Well.”

“Well,” I said. There was almost no sound left in me and still the word came up the way water does if you give it the hole.

Tyne said, “You could kill him.”

“Or,” Sera said carefully, as if she were picking burrs from a child’s hair, “you could talk to him. He is not— It might be a plan to keep a worse thing from happening. He is a man who will stand in front of vines and pretend they cannot rise. You know he would.”

“He would,” I said. “He would stand in front of anything with his hands behind his back if it would save a boy’s skin, even if the saving hurts him. That is true.”

Tyne looked at me. “You love him.”

And because I had already put one confession into the air and found that the room had not fallen, I said, “Yes.”

“Then you could tell him that,” Tyne said. “And he will tell you the truth you already know: if he cuts the rope, it is because he cannot abide a world that binds only one sex and calls it mercy. He will say he thinks he is saving them.”

“Saving who?” Sera asked. “Us. Them. Himself. Names are bells. Which one is he ringing?”

“Men,” I said. “He thinks he is saving men.”

We walked back through the city, past a boy with a pail, a man who held a basket of bread like a baby, a woman who straightened a tin sign so it would clap less in the wind. They were all alive. They were all so ordinary it hurt.

In the palace, Hadran sat in the chair in the narrow room with the small table. The wine was in the glasses. He had not drunk. He looked up as if we had come from a garden instead of a wall.

“My queen,” he said. “My daughter. Walk with me.”

We walked. He held his hands behind his back like a man with bared wrists who wants you to know he has nowhere he can hide anything, and it is a trick; it is also a truth.

“Did you see a room?” he asked, quiet, as if asking if I had seen the moon.

“Yes.”

“Did you see me in it?”

“I saw where you had been.” There is a skill in answering with a slice of truth wide enough to eat but small enough to leave the rest of the loaf.

He nodded. “I knew you would. The city breathes out when you go into places. It breathes in when you leave. I felt the breath.”

“Are you going to cut the rope?” I asked. I do not always know which question is the right door. I know that sometimes if you kick the wall hard enough it remembers it was a door once.

He stopped. We were in the corridor where the tapestries pretend to be forests again. He reached up and touched the woven leaf of an elm, and the leaf did not move, and the threads remembered they were threads and did not remember wind.

“I am going to ask the rope a different question,” he said. “It has been long enough. We have let it be unquestioned for too long because we were so grateful to stop bleeding.”

“That sounds like yes.”

“That sounds like an answer,” he said, “that isn’t a yes or a no. It sounds like a man who wants to find a way to be a person without the guarding stories and also to keep you from being hurt.”

“Someone told me,” I said, “that if you keep men from harming, you teach them that harm is not their business, and so they will never learn not to do it when it is in their hands. They will only be prevented, and prevention cannot be virtue.”

He looked at me with the soft thing in him which is not any part of his body. “It would be easier,” he said, “if virtue could be installed like a bell.”

“Whose bell?”

“Exactly,” he said, and smiled a line across his face that I had not seen before, a tiredness like a new road going somewhere you did not want to travel.

“Don’t do it,” I said. “Please.”

“If I don’t,” he said, “the Lace will. If I put my hands in it first, I can steer. I can shape where the cut goes.”

“You cannot steer blood,” I said. “It’s a river that has been waiting for this thaw for two centuries.”

He put his hands on my shoulders. They were not heavy. They were also heavier than the Book. “I would trust you,” he said, and there was a tremor in it, the first I had ever heard, “to kill me if you thought it would save the city.”

He meant it like a benediction. He meant it as a gift. I heard it like iron.

“Tell me not to,” I said, and there it was, out. “Tell me not to kill you.”

He blinked, surprised, as if I had asked him to lift something he had forgotten was there. “I cannot tell you not to do the work that is yours. I can only ask that you know me as well as you do and decide. I will make no guard against you.”

I wanted to scream. I wanted to. The palace has old walls. They heard me once when I was eleven and they were irritated with me for three days afterwards. I swallowed the scream and it turned into a stone and the stone sat down in my chest and made a small village there.

“I will not forgive you,” I whispered.

“For which thing,” he asked, so quietly, “do you mean.”

“For making me choose,” I said. “For standing where I can reach you.”

He nodded, once. He kissed my forehead this time. It is different from the top of the head. It is more a seal. He left me there with the woven trees. I put my hand out and felt the rough silk. No wind. No wind and the feeling of leaves anyway. Some nights that is comfort. This night it was an insult.

That night the Anchoress sent me a candle that burned blue as if it were breathing underwater. She sent a note with it, small, written on a piece of an old prayer: It is never the murder that saves anyone. It is the story people tell themselves about the thing that happens after.

I set the candle on the floor. I lay on my back and watched the ceiling that had a good idea of being a sky. The blue light turned the fake stars into coins in a basin. I listened for the sound of the rope I couldn’t see, stretched from throat to throat across the country, humming a song I was born inside. I almost slept. I didn’t.

When the dawn made a line at the curtains, Sera knocked once and came in without waiting for me to say the word. She had learned my need. She had also learned to ignore the parts of my need that made the wrong thing easier.

“There was a boy at the river,” she said, which is how women always start these stories, with a boy at a river. “He was standing on a cart and he slipped and his head hit the wheel. A man tried to catch him. He— He lifted his hands and then he couldn’t and then he fell to his knees and he cried and he didn’t know why.”

“His hands,” I said. Mine were on the sheets, palms up.

“They are still under the rope,” Sera said. “For now.”

I got up. I put on my shoes. If you take a step you are in the story deeper. If you do not, you are in it too. Tyne says it doesn’t matter. The story will find you where you stand and tell you your part in its voice.

“Bring me a knife,” I said.

Sera stood still. She blinked. “Which one.”

“The one Hadran gave me to cut bread,” I said. “The one that can cut paper without tearing it.”

“The bread knife,” she said, as if she were telling me a joke we used to tell when the floors were more innocent. “Yes.”

She left me. There is a sound you can hear in someone’s footsteps when they think they are bringing you a world. It is heavier than fear. It is heavier than hope.

I took the blue candle and put it in the window. The light made the snow in the court look like a lake no one had decided to name. I sat. I held my empty hands out like a beggar holding eyes.

I did not think about men. I did not think: men are harmless. I did not think: men are wolves. I thought of boys being taught the sound a bell makes when it is rung by someone they love and someone they fear, and being told the two were the same. I thought of my brother who never existed. I thought of Hadran’s hands on my shoulders and the choice he had put there, the weight of it, the square shape of it. It made my bones remember that they were made of earth.

Sera came back with the bread knife in a clean cloth. I took it. It felt like an ordinary day in winter. The edge was perfect in the way that never lasts very long.

There is a thing that happens in a city the breath before it decides whether to be new or to be itself. It is a sound like all the spoons being put down at once. I heard that sound then. The rope hummed. The walls hummed. The Book of Oaths, wherever it had been laid for the night like a sleeping dog whose dreams are all gardens, hummed.

Hadran opened the door and stepped in. He had not knocked. He wore the coat that looks like ink about to decide upon ocean. He closed the door behind him the way you do when you are trying not to wake the house.

“We are decided today, then,” he said softly.

“No,” I said. “We are being decided. There is a difference.”

He smiled his woolen smile. He put his hands behind his back. He took one step toward me.

I raised the bread knife. And the blue candle trembled. And somewhere beneath the floors, somewhere in the courts, somewhere in a room that was not a room, a hand tried to become a fist and remembered it had been told a story a long time ago about not being allowed, and it faltered. The world held its breath—not because of a man, not because of a woman, but because of the idea of both.

“Maelin,” Hadran said. If I write it plain—my name—it does not sound like that sound does when someone else makes it. He said it like a prayer for bread will be answered.

“You told me to kill you if I thought,” I said. “What if I think and think and the thinking is only a net. What if I wait. What if waiting kills us faster.”

“Then you cut,” he said.

“It is possible,” I said, “to have two ropes. If I cut yours, I may cut mine. If I cut mine, I may cut the city. If I cut the city, it may bleed into a shape that we were not made to recognize. If we bleed, who will tell us a story that lets us stay.”

He took another step. He moved slowly because he knows how fast I can be. The knife didn’t weigh anything. Sometimes the lightest thing in the room is the one that will break your hand.

“Tell me a story,” I said. “Tell me why a man who was given the Quiet would want to wake the part of himself that remembers fists.”

“Because,” he said, and the word was a hinge, “men are not harmless.”

The knife went cold in my hands. Sera’s breath at my back broke. Tyne’s knots in the far wall loosened just enough to shed one truth.

“And,” Hadran said, after a heartbeat so long I could have measured it with string, “that is why the harmlessness has never been enough. A harmless man is a child. A man who knows his strength and refuses to use it—that is a man. We have had boys in silk writing down laws that they never had to bear the sharp edge of. They were harmless. They made rules because they could. But harmlessness is not virtue, Maelin. And virtue requires some knowledge of harm, if only to turn away.”

There it was. The cut in the rope that he wanted. Not to loose all the old wolves. To teach the lambs that they could be wolves and must choose not to.

“And if they choose wrong,” I said. “If one does. If a hundred do. If all.”

“Then we will be like the rest of the world has always been,” he said quietly. “We will make answers. We will make Mothers. We will make things, not nets. We will bleed and learn.”

I raised the knife. The blue candle shrugged. Outside, the snow decided to melt and un-decided itself. My breath went in. His did. The rope hummed. Somewhere a bell rang that had never been hung.

And I stood there with the bread knife and realized I could kill him to save the men, or I could kill him because killing him would keep the world harmless and the men harmless in it, and that would not be saving anyone. The room stuttered. The story I brought with me did too.

“Look at me,” he said softly. “I am your father and I am a man. I am neither of these things and also both. Decide which door we walk through, daughter.”

My hand trembled. Not because I did not know how to hold a knife, but because all at once the thing in me that had been waiting for a chance to be a story found out that stories are written down in rooms, yes, and also in our tendons.

I did not lower the knife. But I did not cut. Not then. Not yet. The rope sang a note I hadn’t heard before, somewhere between loss and relief, like the way water sings when a boat that has been roped all winter is untied and remembers how to move.

Sera, behind me, had her hand at my back. It was steady. She didn’t push. Tyne’s knots in some other part of the palace tightened, or loosened—it is always both at once, she says.

“I need a day,” I said. “And a night.”

“Take an hour,” Hadran said. “The Lace are moving faster than daylight.”

And I gave him a woman’s answer and a queen’s: “I will take as long as I take.”

There are chapters to everything. Even to a breath. Even to a rope. Even to a knife coming down through the air, or staying in a hand that chooses to learn what harmlessness is and what it is not before it moves. It turns out the men are all harmless or they are not; it turns out the word means nothing without a person to wear it. I looked at him, and he looked at me, and the first chapter ended without a cut. The second began anyway, because it always does.By morning the blue candle had guttered itself into a mouth-sized pool, a little inland sea in a porcelain cup, and the light it had made had silvered the frost on the inside of my window until even the ghost of my breath had looked like a thing wearing jewelry. I had not slept, unless you call the half-swoons between thoughts sleep, which I do not, not when the thoughts wore knives for hats. The palace was making the sound it makes in the last hour before servants admit dawn has happened to them, spoons going into jars with gentleness, boots being laced by hands that know the clocks without looking. The rope was a hum you could not locate, like thinking you hear a hive and then finding the bees have moved into your bones.

“I am going out,” I told Sera when she came in with the news about the river boy and the hands that had risen and then remembered their tale. She had a smudge on her jaw like ash that didn’t belong to any fire I could see. She looked at the knife I had not set down, the bread knife wrapped again in its cloth, and then at my face, which had not learned anything new except how to hold the same decision differently.

“You can’t go out with that under your cloak,” she said, and then did not forbid me. We have that kind of friendship, the kind where the forbidding would make more trouble than the disobedience.

“I’m not going out to cut,” I said. “I’m going out to listen. There are ears in a market that aren’t attached to any head at all.”

The East Gate opened to the city the way an eye does when you tell it a story. We took the path I always think of as the one that belongs to onions: it goes down to the winter market where the barrels are stacked like small drum-towers and the women who sell turnips have scarves as bright as flags. It was one of those mornings when frost pretends to be smoke, lifting off a barrel like something that would like to be breathed if it had the courage. Sera walked half a step behind me and half a step beside me because her body does not understand that it is only one person and cannot be in all the places at once that would make it satisfied.

The market had the sound of bargains being pretended into existence. There was a boy with a chain of tin fish that shivered the way real fish do in buckets, because tin learns everything we ask it to be. A woman hammered a nail into a crate and the nail sounded pleased to be useful. Somewhere a jar broke, quietly, the way people break when they have time to collect the pieces and tell themselves it was only glass. I watched the men because that is what was required of me, which made me feel like a spy in my own city. They carried crates, they counted coins, they put their hands to their mouths when something was funny. A barrel shifted on a cart and toppled toward a child and two men threw out their arms and then their elbows remembered their vows and curled, and their hands became the hands of men who are told that catching is a kind of harm if a grip can bruise, and they fell to their knees and their mouths made the round O of a question that never completes itself. The barrel struck the cobbles and cracked and sent up a sigh and out of it ran apples that had not wanted to be counted yet. A woman stepped in front of the child and her skirt took a scuff of apple flesh the color of good bruises and the child cried because that is what children are meant to do when a barrel makes the world bigger at their feet.

Sera exhaled and I heard the shape of the air she had been making inside herself. It was not relief. It was not alarm exactly either. It was the sound you hear from a rope when you test it with your weight and it tells you it has not yet frayed to the core. She bought apples from the woman because Sera thinks commerce is a kind of blessing you can give with your hands, and the woman looked at me the way people look when they are not supposed to know you. I let her, because all knowing is disobedience of a sort, and disobedience has saved us often enough.

Carrin’s mother’s shop was a small room with a mouth that breathed beeswax and a back that breathed heat. The candles stood to attention on the shelves the way soldiers might if soldiers were allowed to be useful indoors, ranks of slender tapers with their heads already willing to be fire. Carrin’s mother had a scar at the corner of her mouth in the shape of a comma, as if she had to pause and then go on. She wiped her hands on a rag when she saw me and then remembered to curtsey and then decided not to and then bowed a little and finally came and put her palms on the counter and said, “Majesty,” the way a woman says, This day I will not be surprised by anything, even you.

“I said I would have your gate fixed,” I told her, and at once heard the foolishness of it. You do not carry a promise under your tongue like a coin and then show it when what is required is bread.

“My boy said you would,” she said, and her mouth comma loosened a little. “He is a good one, is Carrin. He was his father’s hands when his father’s hands had to be quiet and could not fix the bolt. I told him not to go up the stairs where the men go, but a kettle is a kettle and a boy is a boy.”

“What was his father’s name?” I asked. It is one of the ways to lay a cloth over a thing before you take the lid off it.

“Lath,” she said, and it was a good name, a simple piece of wood with a job to do. “He used to make pipes that sang in winter when the steam ran through them. He cried once over a mouse he stepped on. He could not hold a child hard enough to lift her out of the way of a falling beam when he was younger because the rope had been tied into him like a word, and the child lived anyway because she tripped and the beam missed her head. He thought that was grace. I think it was an accident that allowed a man to go on being himself.”

Carrin came from the back with a box of wicks and then stopped, a colt seeing ice, because he had not expected to find me exactly where his mother kept her scale. His hair had given up on being severe. It was a little boy’s hair again, startled into cowlicks by the heat.

“I need you,” I said, and saw the way the words shook his chest. We do not say that often to men, which is a practice that makes more trouble than sense.

“Yes,” he said, and then found the rest. “For what can I be used, Majesty?”

I asked him to come at dusk to the East Gallery and to bring with him six others who would come if he asked, and I watched his face do the adding without understanding the sum. “Bring boys who know the stairs and boys who know the river and one who can speak without making a fist of his voice,” I said. “This is not for bravery. This is for something that looks like it from the back but is not the same.”

He nodded and looked at his mother and she nodded, and in that exchange there was the city, the whole of it, its consent and its stubbornness and its way of taking a queen’s request and making it into a family errand.

We walked back to the palace by a street that had decided not to be on any maps, which is how the best streets live longest. Sera had stopped trying to not be seen. She marked faces the way you mark points on a map with small flags, and I saw by the little lift of her eyebrow that she had seen three men I had not. When we came into the East Gallery the ceiling’s orderly stars seemed suddenly like an insult, and for a moment I wanted to call a ladder and a woman with a knife and have done with them. Instead I sent for the Mothers.

They came the way bees come, first two and then a scatter and then all at once as if someone had shaken a tree. Mother Vell with her hair braided like the stern edge of a wave, Mother Jona with her hands wrapped because she had been training a girl to take a blow to the forearm and not drop her weapon, Mother Sarai with her eyes like the small straight knives used for picking fish-bones out of stew. They took their places with the habits of their bodies, which is to say they arranged themselves between the doors and me and they turned the room into a shelter built of attention.

“The Anchoress has told you what she told me,” I said, and they nodded, which saved time and took away comfort both. “Tyne opened a door for me. There is a room where the Lace do their work, and Hadran has left his breath there. He means to steer a cut in the rope we have all called mercy. If he does not cut, they will. He thinks his hand on the blade will teach it not to be cruel.”

“And you did not cut him,” Mother Vell said, voice even, eyes without a ripple. She does not put judgement on words as garnish.

“I have not,” I said. “I do not yet think that murder would be the same as saving. I have one day and one night inside which to make a shape that holds.”

“You could arrest him,” Mother Jona said, which is a kind of kindness, the kind that builds a cage and calls it a resting place. “You could put him where his hands cannot reach the door to those rooms.”

“And what story would that make?” Tyne said from the doorway, because doors are rarely closed against people who know how to ask wood the right question. She walked in with her string like a cat’s tail around her wrist and took the air out of the corners of the room the way she always does, drawing it towards wherever she is because she is the most interesting cold fire. “A queen who jails her father because he thought a thought? A rope that frays because it was frightened? They will write ballads about how you feared men would stand. Fear is a good thread if you want your garment to itch and come apart in the rain.”

“I was not going to arrest him,” I said, and Tyne’s mouth relaxed around the word queen the way a carpenter’s hand relaxes on a good plane. “I am going to write a story first. I would like it to be true.”

“I will knot you truth if you give me something to tie it to,” Tyne said. “What will you make?”

“A vow not made of prohibition,” I said, tasting each syllable as if it were a coin I had to test with my teeth. “A vow that is taken, not put in, a thing a man can pick up and wear and then take responsibility for wearing. The Book of Oaths is a door you have to push through yourself; it has only ever opened inward. We have used it to keep men from moving. I will use it to teach them how to stand still when standing still is harder than running. They must know harm. They must name it and refuse it. They must show me hands that could bruise and do not. But it cannot be only a law. Law without weight is a kite you fly from a window. I want a stone in their pockets.”

Mother Sarai’s mouth tilted. “You want to make a thing that sits in a man like a piece of grit sits in an oyster, until he is used to it and has made it beautiful by building around it.”

“Yes,” I said. “But faster than oysters take. I am not given years.”

Tyne turned the string around her fingers and made a small clover leaf and slipped it onto the air the way some women slip jewelry on their daughters. “You will need men to choose it. Seven is a good number for choice. Any fewer and the rope thinks you’re playing at cats’ cradles. Any more and it becomes a crowd and crowds are a trick we play on ourselves to think we agree. You will need seven who will stand and say I could and I do not. Do not make them noble. Choose one who stole bread as a boy and one who never learned to shout his own name in an alley and one who is already tired of being told he is harmless.”

“I have sent for boys,” I said, and at Mother Jona’s quick glance I added, “Young men, forgive me. There is Carrin and he will bring six. I will ask Hadran to be the eighth.”

“Eighth for a circle is either bad luck or the wheel,” Tyne said. “It depends on whether you want to go somewhere.”

The Anchoress came in with river water in a bowl and the bowl was carved out of something that had not decided whether to be wood or bone. She had not told me she would come and that is her way: she remembers you wanted something before you have decided to want it, and then she arrives with it and looks as if she has done nothing whatsoever. The water smelled of iron and something like mint that had grown near the bank and not liked its neighbours.

“They will move at dusk,” she said, setting the bowl down on the long table where the men lay their plans and forget to wipe up the ink. “They have a name for the hour so they can pretend it belongs to them. They call it the Straightening, because the lace lies flatest when you pull it just to the point before it tears. I have seen the thread they are using. It is not one of ours. It hums in a way that makes my tongue feel as if it has been told to be quiet by a polite man.”

“Can it be cut?” I asked, and when Tyne made a shape with her mouth that meant maybe-not, the Anchoress shook her head at her.

“Not for long,” she said. “But you can tangle it. You can make it tell a different story if you get your hands on the end. The man with the end is Hadran. He does not know he holds it like that. He thinks he is holding a leash in case a dog decides to bite. But he holds the end that will let us tangle.”

“Everything is ending ends,” Tyne said, kissing her teeth at the pun as if she had not meant to make it and found it prettier than she expected. “Do not cut your man. Cut the piece he holds. If you cannot cut it with any of the knives we own, cut it with a word. There are words with edges harder than bone.”

I sent for Hadran and he came as if he had been waiting outside the door because sometimes he is. He looked at the bowl the way a man looks at a map of a place he once lived and was not sure he loved. His eyes had a shadow at the bottom of them like a thing that had not slept, and I realized he had not slept either, and something petty and small in me rejoiced and then was ashamed.

“You mean to make a rite,” he said, not a question. He can follow the wet footprints of a thought across a floor better than anyone I know.

“I mean to write something into a place that isn’t paper,” I said. “Men have carried a story for two centuries without being asked if it fits. I am going to ask seven if they want to carry something that will not unfasten when a knife touches it.”

“And if they do,” he murmured, “and if enough do after them, the Lace’s cut will make less noise. It will be a tearing at the edge of a silk that has been lined with hemp. It will not run.”

“Help me,” I said, and there it was, the word again, the one men hear and then build a cart under. “Stand with me. Wear the grit. Be one of the seven or the eighth who makes the circle a wheel.”

His face did a thing I have never yet learned, because it is a thing faces do when they are stopped between pride and tenderness and desire to be just and the terrible vanity of a man who wants to call the storm by his name. “I will not promise to abandon the Lace to their uglier purposes,” he said. “I cannot promise to leave the rope tied where it is. But I will stand in your rite, and I will vow with my mouth what I think men should vow with their teeth.”

“Good,” I said, and handed him no cup to drink, because there is a kind of celebration that would make the others think it was done. “We work until dusk. Sera, send for the bell-men. No bells rung, but I want the ropes in their hands. Tyne, give me seven knots and teach me where to place them on a skin that will not take thread. Anchoress, write the word with the edge in it and put it on my tongue without letting me see it.”

“You will taste metal for hours,” the Anchoress said with a small approving hum. “Metal is what truth tastes like when it has not been polished by anyone’s story yet.”

We set the East Gallery for a rite it had not held in anyone’s memory. We moved the long table against the false stars and the men who had polished it wept in their hearts at the smudges and then told themselves that history would call the marks interesting. We unrolled the old runner that has girls wrestled into it, figures of women in threads faded to tea, binding wolves with red ribbons and laughing. It is a joke the weavers made once and it has never stopped being a good one. We set nine chairs in a circle, because circles are the only things that look like doors and prisons both, and I paced the space between them until the narrow shoes I wore forgot their purpose and had to be reminded.

They came at dusk, the seven, walking a little too carefully because they knew they walked into a story and everyone who has ever stepped onto a stage knows how impossible it is to pretend your body is just a body and not an instrument. Carrin brought a boy with a baker’s arms and a boy with a sailor’s balance and a man with ink under his nails that would not come out no matter how you scrubbed, and two who could have passed for one another if they had not had different ears, and finally one with a scar on his chin that said he had fallen once at a run and had not learned to slow. I took their names into my mouth and put them on the table because that is how you make names heavy enough to do the work.

“I am going to ask you to pick something up,” I said. “Not a blade. A word. It will be put in your mouths and you will either spit it out or swallow it. If you spit it out we will sweep and the floor will be clean and you will still be who you were before you came. If you swallow it you will feel it like a seed that has been in water and swelled against the skin of your throat. It will not choke you. It will ask you to be thirsty for the rest of your life.”

They nodded, because most boys think thirst is manly, and most men are still boys in that way and do not mind being so. I went around with Tyne’s knots on a thread and the Anchoress’s word in my mouth like a coin under a tongue before hanging. I held their hands and felt the way their pulse spoke to my fingers and I said it into them, that word with its edge, and I watched their throats move. The baker’s boy cried without making water at his eyes and I loved him for it. The sailor laughed and then went still as a mast in wind that comes from all directions at once. Carrin looked for his mother in the crowd that had pretended not to gather and saw only me and I nodded and he swallowed.

Hadran came last, of course he did, because men who know they are about to be watched will make a ceremony of every step. He did not take a chair. He stood and looked at the circle and then at me and the blue candle, which I had had set in a clear bowl of water so that its light would not choose only one direction, and we were for a moment the old story—daughter, father, bread, knife, water, light. I put the word on his tongue and his mouth did not close at first, and I saw the way he argued with the word, told it a parable of wolves who had learned to wear wool as choice and not as punishment, and then he swallowed. The room made the sound of all the wool being put down from the backs of chairs at once.

“You have weight now,” I told the seven and the eighth. “It is not a right. Do not say it is a right. It is a thing that will make you slower when speed would be easier. You are not harmless. You never were. You carry knowledge of harm closer now than other men and you will put your hands to work at not doing it. If you do a harm now, the city will say, What did the queen make? If you refuse, the city will say, What did the queen ask of those men? This is unfair. All of this is unfair. That does not make it untrue.”

In the far corners the bell-men stood with their ropes in hand and their faces in the posture of men who want to be told to pull and will not pull without the word. The rope in the walls hummed and then went quiet and then hummed again, a fish deciding where to winter. The Anchoress stood with her hands tucked into her sleeves as if she were a small piece of statuary of a saint of impatience. Tyne watched the ceiling as if it might crumble into lace if she glared hard enough to scare it honest.

“They move now,” the Anchoress said to me under the noise and the not-noise. “The Straightening begins in the room with the table that isn’t a table. Your man holds an end. If you want to tangle, you have to get your fingers into the mouth of the knot before the first breath is held.”

I left Mother Vell with the circle and with a long strip of paper and a pen that had bitten words into the skins of both kinds of law and told her to write down every refusal she saw made by a man tonight in that room, those chairs, that air. It is not magic to write things, but we forget how keen it can be. Sera, Tyne and I went down, not the way we had gone before, because doors remember you and sometimes decide not to want you back. We went the long way, through the rooms where the old banners sleep, where my grandmother’s portrait looks out at a window full of the memory of the sea, and through the little corridor where the walls remember the smell of salted beef. Tyne made her song in her teeth and looped her string around the hinge the way a child loops a ribbon around a cat that has agreed to be tied if you are kind enough, and the wall declined to be a wall, and we went up the thoughts of stairs.

There were more men there than last time, not many and yet any number is too many when what they are about to be is a story. Three books that are not books waited on the table like small coffins made for things that do not have bodies. The glass had settled onto the wall like ice on a river that does not intend to hold anyone’s weight without making a joke of it. The Lace wore their collars the way you wear a bruise you want to show without explaining how you got it, and their hands hovered over the table and did not settle because hovering made the work feel cleaner. Hadran stood apart and the end of the thread the Anchoress had told me about lay at his elbow like a snake that was pretending to be too lazy to strike.

“Do not speak,” Tyne breathed in my ear, and I did not, not then, because the room would have taken my words and made soup of them and given them back to the men with their own spice. Sera set her feet and looked at every man as if he were a door she had already walked through and could choose to walk through again if she had to. The humming in my bones had become a high-keening thing, a beehive that had been lifted and shaken and set down and left to decide whether it would stay.

The Lace began. It was not a hymn, it was not law, it was not arithmetic. It was a pattern spoken on breath, the way you can lay a cloth without putting it on a table, just by looking at the space and deciding, This will be where it falls. They said old words and new ones, and some of the words were not words at all but exhalations shaped like letters that have not been invented, and they pulled at their collars as if the lace had started to itch, and the books that were not books shone where they did not exist, which is a way of shining that is worse than any other.

Hadran looked at me. He did not turn his head. He looked at me with the part of his face that listens. He moved his elbow and the end of the thread rolled and showed me its mouth. It was not a mouth. It was the idea of one. I took the cloth off the bread knife and held the blade in my hand to keep it from reflecting anyone’s face, and Tyne shook her head once and then nodded and then lifted her string and wrapped it around my wrist tight enough to leave marks that looked like a memory of a cage. The Anchoress’s word was still back there in the East Gallery, working itself into the teeth of seven men and a man who had never been allowed to be anything else, but words are faster than feet when they want to be and I felt it come to rest behind my eyes like a small bird deciding to be brave.

The Lace said their last vanishing exhale and the room leaned. It is a trick rooms have, leaning without anyone in it moving, so that you feel your bones remind you of downhill. A man at the end of the table who had ink under his nails of a color I have never seen in any ordinary well of law closed his hand a little, and the hand remembered a fist from someone else’s story because this man had never made one, and his eyes filled with the stupid relief that comes when the restraint you have not chosen is lifted and you think you are free and you do not yet know you are only powerful. Sera’s breath beside me turned into rope. Tyne’s string bit my skin.

I stepped into the room as if stepping into cold river water in summer when you have told yourself you will not squeal. I put the bread knife to the air just above Hadran’s elbow where the end lay like something that would twitch if you thought about it. I did not know if you can cut an idea with a kitchen blade, even a good one. I only knew it had an edge and the thread had an ending and sometimes edges and endings get along.

“Maelin,” Hadran said, and the room pretended it had not heard him, as rooms do when they are parties where only one kind of conversation is allowed, and one of the Lace raised his hand to bat me away as if I were a moth, and his hand reached the end of its own rope and stopped, and his face went stupid with the surprise of still being told no after he had done all this work to make the no go away.

I brought the knife down as if cutting the freshest loaf in winter, the one you mean to share and also mean to take the end slice for yourself because you are the one who did the work. The blade met nothing and then it met a resistance like hair that has been braided and pulled so it will not tangle, and there was a sound without sound, a bell that has never been hung ringing because someone had written the idea of a rope into the air, and the end of the thread that was not thread parted and curled like cut ribbon and tried to make itself into a knot with no fingers.

The humming in my bones diverged. It was like standing between two hives suddenly, one on either side of the path, both full and angry and confused and thinking you were the bear. One song said, Let it be cut and let virtue be what men have to learn the way we did, with blood and sorry. The other said, Hold the fence awhile longer until the lambs grow horns of their own and learn which way to turn them. The man with the ink on his nails made the fist and brought it up as if to see whether the world would punish him. It trembled there, a little foolish thing, a child pretending to be a hammer.

Sera stepped forward without stepping forward and the room shivered because it wanted to misread her as threat and could not, because her danger lives only in defence and the rope knows the difference, even when men do not. Tyne made a loop in air and let it fall around the books that were not books and they dimmed, and the glass on the wall showed me not my face, not his face, not any face, but a knotted cord that had been flung into a corner of a boat and taken salt for years until it had become a hard, holy thing that could be used as a weapon or a mooring equally.

“Now,” the Anchoress whispered, though she was not here, and I knew she meant, Speak.

“Stop,” I said, and my voice went into the room like a blade and then gentled itself because I remembered to not let it cut. “Look at me. All of you who have ever made a rule while being harmless, look at me now that your hands itch. I am your queen. I am your mother in law. I am your daughter in the law. I am the woman who will not be made safer by what you are about to do and will not be made freer either. Hadran will not save you by giving you back what your great-grandfathers used to have. I will not save you by keeping you children. Take the weight. Swallow it. Refuse. If you take a swing in this room, you will have to tell your own sons what it felt like to prefer power to virtue.”

The man with the fist let it fall open because some part of him wanted not to be a bad story in the mouth of people he had not yet met. Another at the table sobbed the way calves do when the rope is slackened for the first time and they do not know they are about to be led into a field and think instead that the tall grass is a drowned thing. Hadran’s face turned very gentle, which is to say very dangerous, because he is himself most himself when he loves.

The end I had cut twitched again and reached toward Hadran’s elbow as if it had missed its hand and I slapped it with the flat of the bread knife the way you slap a cat who is thinking of making a bad jump, not hard but with a history in it. Tyne’s string burned my wrist. Sera’s hand came to the small of my back and did not push or steady, only reminded me that I was not carving bread alone in an empty kitchen.

We had come to the part of a story where the next sentence decides what book we think we are inside. The Lace gathered themselves like skirts and whispered the letters that make a pattern that makes a door. Hadran’s mouth shaped a yes and a no at once, and he lifted his hands the way you lift them to receive bread you are not sure you deserve. The rope at the edges of the world sang an E if you were trained that way and a prayer if you were not, and in the East Gallery seven throats that had learned a word with an edge spoke it again and made a second knot in the air that no one could see and everyone could trip over.

I breathed, and the room breathed, and the cut end decided it would not be the only decision.Chapter Five

The cut end wriggled like any freed thing, pleased with its own invention, and in the same instant the room invented another choice as if it were ashamed to have offered us only one. A thread I had not seen that was not a thread at all but a path taken by breath flickered above the table, the Lace leaned into it with their shoulders and, in the East Gallery, seven throats learned to speak a weight again. I felt them across the palace like the way you feel rain begin even if you are under a roof, a pressure change, a kiss your skin answers without consent. The vow I had placed on their tongues turned in them and became something with corners. It rubbed the inside of their mouths and made them want water. That wanting was the most honest thing in the building.

Hadran’s gaze was a hand held out to me with the fingers folded, an invitation with no palm in it. “Let go,” I said, not to him alone, not to the Lace alone, not to the end that wanted to leap back into his keeping, but to the room. Tyne drew her string tight around my wrist and murmured something into it that sounded like she was telling a child a story about a bridge that holds only because everyone goes over it without noticing. The man with the ink under his nails closed his eyes and opened his mouth as if he would take a bite out of the air and then remembered hunger makes men greedy speakers and chose not to speak. His fist, which had been handmade out of his new permission, softened the way butter softens when someone lights an oven next door.

The Lace began again, a different pattern, a different lie dressed in an older fabric. They said names the rope remembered from the first tying, they said places men had stood when they learned their wrists were not instruments, they called up the moments when boys have looked at knives and thought them brave. The not-books flared, then sulked, the glass remembered one face and then decided faces were vulgar and erased it. At my back Sera took one step closer as if to lay her spine against mine, a hinge shoring up another hinge. She did not touch me. She never touches me in rooms where men have asked wood to be their accomplice. I held the bread knife with its memory of crust and the silence between us and put the flat of it against the end again and the end curled like a fern that had just learned the word pain.

“Tell them the rest,” Tyne breathed, her teeth on the thread leaving small dents that the thread did not mind. “Tell them it is not a gift if they do not unwrap it themselves. Tell them harmlessness was always a coat and we have all been cold inside it.”

I did not want to speak in the language the room had set itself to. I wanted to call stones by their small names and invite women in from the market on the pretense of a dropped coin and fill the corners with skirts. But the Straightening had begun and when lace is being pulled the safest way to save it is to put something heavy on the edge. I put my words down in a line and weighted them with my throat.

“You have work that you have never allowed yourselves to do,” I said, and my voice took its dress from the air and made a shape the men could look at without feeling scolded. “The rope did it for you. It ran errands in your blood. It kept you from making the sort of mistakes that change lives into funerals and then told you that you had been good boys. Meanwhile the women did the heavy lifting, which is different from the kind done in yards and chambers. They lifted grief. They lifted fear. They lifted the long consequence of laws written with hands that had never trembled. Do not stand there and ask the rope to move so you can learn what your fists are like. Stand there and ask yourselves if you are willing to stand with your hands open when someone hands you anger and asks you to break your own teeth on it.”

Something in the ceiling tore itself neatly, a sound like a seam releasing, and for a second I thought the East Gallery had sent one of its tame constellations to tumble into this room as a messenger. Then the bell-men, up there under their painted sky, pulled their ropes just once. It was not enough to make any bell ring. It was enough to remind every rope in the palace that it had a purpose and that purpose could be to hold and could be to speak. Even the thread near Hadran’s elbow listened, the way a trick listens for applause.

Hadran’s lip did a thing that would have been called trembling on any mouth but his. He lifted his hands away from the end, and in the space that gesture made the end did the natural thing and tried to fall to the floor, and Tyne flicked her string and in mid-fall the cut piece tangled itself in her knot the way a swallow tangles itself in rain and discovers it is still flying. Sera’s knife was still in her sheath. She had made an oath when she was twelve that she would not honor blades in rooms unless there was already blood on the floor, and the floor had managed not to oblige her.

The Lace were not a single man nor a single mind. They took affront in different flavors, lemon and bay and the sort of bitterness you bruise when you press between finger and thumb. One of them laughed, thin and high, and if the Quiet had not already been under their feet that sound would have made the room dangerous. Another looked at Hadran with the eyes of a man who writes down his debts and enjoys drawing the line through them too much. “You brought her,” he said, which was not true and also not false, the kind of statement cowards make to keep their hands from showing what they believe.

Hadran did not turn his head. He addressed the table the way men address altar stones when they have convinced themselves the stones can hear. “You wanted a cut,” he said. “I told you I would test the edge before we put the blade to anyone’s throat. The test was this: if the first fist made by this act is made in this room, you are not fit to hold the knife. Put your hands down. If you cannot, we are not men, we are only appetites.”

The man with the ink under his nails did not look at him. He looked at me and then at the bread knife as if he had just realized what it has always meant to be given bread and not have to steal it. His fist went slack and he put it on the table, palm open, the way boys do when a teacher says we will not write until you all stop fidgeting. The other faces fell and rose in small ways and then the Lace as a body looking like many bodies made of starch and vanity put their hands down because it was a better fashion than the other one and not because anyone had convinced them of anything truer.

The rope at the edge of the world changed key. It did not cut. It did not pull. It shifted its weight onto a different foot in a dance it had been doing for two hundred years so that anyone watching would think, They have always danced like that. Somewhere in the city a child slapped another child with an open hand and then burst into tears that tasted of iron and said, I do not like it, and his mother turned away to wipe her face because it would be a long day and the next and the next and she did not want the boy to see that she had hope in her finger bones.

Tyne made a shape with her string and fed the cut end into it and nodded to me as if to say, It will not behave forever, but it will behave for the hour. “You have a rite upstairs,” she said, not looking at Hadran, not looking at the Lace, looking at my hand on the bread knife as if it were a compass that had never seen north and somehow still pointed. “Go finish putting rocks in the boys. I cannot knot a water that you will not fill.”

Sera and I stepped backward one pace because in rooms like this you do not turn your back until you have made sure the doors have remembered their manners. Hadran moved as if he would come with us and one of the Lace lifted a finger and then put it down, a small surrender, a small and necessary humiliation, the sort that might teach a lesson if it is allowed to sting. “You cannot unsay an hour,” Hadran told them, and then he left them with their not-books and their mirrors that hate faces and their breath-patter that would not amount to anything today because my knife had made a cut that was the wrong kind for their purpose.

The corridor back to the East Gallery did that thing corridors do when they know you have work in you you have not yet done; it made itself shorter than it is and took away two turns and returned them later like a loan repaid with interest. In the Gallery the circle of chairs was still a hinge open wide, the seven sat like men trying to remember how knees are meant to bend and not to perform virtue with them. Mother Vell’s paper ran like a river across her lap, lines and lines of refusals she had caught and pinned and named. They were small. A boy stood back from a cart that would have crushed his toes and did not kick the wheel in anger when it did not oblige by moving. A man at the ovens did not slam a paddle down when a woman took the loaf without paying. A soldier in the palace yard put her hand over a man’s mouth when he began to tell a story that would have broken his own heart and guided him with her palm until his voice found water instead of rocks.

The Anchoress had come in by the window that thinks it is a door and had left river-water footprints that disappeared as if the floor were embarrassed to have been stepped on by anything as admitting as river. She held a small bundle of herbs bound with red thread in her mouth like a cat that has brought you a gift it intends to kill at your feet. She blew on the bundle and the smoke smelled like winter in a city where people have decided to be kind. “They are at pause,” she said, and I did not need her to tell me which they. “They have found a seam they did not know was in the cloth. They will pick at it with their teeth until one of them bleeds.”

“Good,” Tyne said, coming in behind us with the cut end squirming in her string like a worm that has realized it is divided and cannot decide which half of itself to be. “Let them bleed on their collars. White looks less honest on a throat that has never eaten well and spilled. What do we call this thing she has made?” She turned her chin at me and I knew she meant the vow, the weight I had put into mouths, the grit I wanted to turn into pearls without waiting a decade.

“Burden would be honest,” Mother Jona said, counting the men and then counting again to see if one had slipped out of the rope. “Burden is what they think we have not been carrying all this time, and I like honesty when it surprises a man enough to make him drop a coin into a beggar’s bowl.”

“Burden is what people set down when they get tired,” Mother Sarai said. She had stopped wrapping her hands and now her fingers looked like clever fish. “Call it something that makes them vain of bearing it. Vainness has held more houses up than good sense in some ages.”

Hadran was at my shoulder. He had not asked permission and Sera had let him because her sense of when to keep men outside is precise as a surgeon’s and she had decided that right now he counted as a tool and not as a threat. He listened to the Mothers the way a tree listens to axes, willing to learn their rhythm if only to know how to time its falling. “Call it the Weight,” he said, and I heard he meant it to be plain and ordinary and therefore inescapable. “Not burden, not gift, not grace. Weight. You will feel it. You will carry it. You will build muscle under it. If you drop it, we will hear.”

“Weight,” I said, and the word fit my mouth as if it had always been waiting there behind my teeth like a grain. The seven looked up when I said it, and I saw the moment it went in. Men like to be asked to lift things. They like it better than being asked to set them down. “You are not harmless,” I said, and I said it as if I were telling them they were beautiful, so that they would not flinch. “You never were. Now you have Weight. It will not make choices for you. It will make every choice you make heavier. If you ever lift a hand in harm, it will be harder to lift for a long time afterwards, and if you lift it to help, it will become stronger. Do not ask me how the Weight knows. I do not know how bread knows when to rise and yet I do not take that as an excuse to eat paste.”

Carrin smiled, almost without wanting to, and then made his face grave because the others were watching and men do not yet know how to be happy without being looked at. The baker’s boy put his hand under his own thigh as if to keep himself from standing too quickly, as if the Weight had come to rest there and he liked the feel of it. The sailor rolled his shoulders and then was still, as if he had made a bargain with his own tide.

The Lace did not come. I had expected some flurry, some parading forward to accuse me of treason to their beautiful net. Instead there was only the sound the palace makes when men decide not to walk through a door because a woman is on the other side with a knife that smells like bread. The bell-men looked to me and I shook my head and they did not ring, and still a sound went through the city like a bell has when it is rung in someone’s chest. It is not a sound you can locate. It is the noise people make when they realize they have been seen doing something no one has punished them for and no one has praised them for and they will have to decide for themselves whether to go on.

“What now,” Sera said, and she did not mean in the next breath. She meant in the next year and the next and the season after my childbearing years if I ever had any to begin with. She meant patrol and law and whether we would need to make prisons where all we have had for generations are schools and kitchens and the places where the women tie their sandals before going out to harvest law and bring it in before the frost.

“Now we count,” Mother Vell said. She set down her river of refusals on the table and weighted it with the Book so it would not curl back on itself and become difficulty. “Now we keep writing. Now every Mother who sees a man choose not to harm writes it in this hand and each night we bring the paper to your bed and put it under your head like herbs so you will sleep. If there are more refusals than there are intentions, we will know it is working. If there are more intentions than there are refusals, we will go to the river and we will call stones our sisters.”

“We will also fight,” Sera said, and her voice was the sound of someone putting away a clean dress so it does not get blood on it. “There will be men who take not just their hands back but the stories they were told before the rope. We will fight them. We will teach our girls to fight them. We will teach our boys to fight the desire to be them. Tell me I am allowed to say this and not be called unpoetic.”

“You are allowed,” I said, and kissed her forehead in my head because it is not wise to do it in the room where we had just made law. The East Gallery does not like to be turned into a nursery. It will, but it rustles for a week afterwards.

Hadran stood too still and I recognized the particular stillness. It is the stillness of men who have gotten what they asked for and now must inventory the cost. He looked up as if he meant to read the stars off the ceiling as if they were minutes. “The Lace will go to the Twined Counties first,” he said. “They are soft there, and the men like to believe they are rougher than they are. They will make an example.” He did not say of whom. He did not have to. Examples are always made of boys who cannot afford to be the counterexample.

“Then we will go there before them,” I said, and at once a silence tightened around the word we. Queens do not go to counties before rivers thaw unless they intend to make the sort of story that ends with a ballad. My Mothers’ mouths made their different shapes of dismay, practical and holy. The Anchoress rolled an herb bundle between finger and thumb and watched a thought in the smoke that did not tell her its name. Tyne cocked her head at my wrists as if measuring how much string she would need to keep those hands safe and still allow them to hold.

“We,” Sera said finally, which was consent and a roster both. “We will go. Take Jona. Take Sarai. Take Vell if you mean to write at the doors of men and make them read under their own lintels. Take the bell-men. Bells make even stupid villages smarter for a week. The Lace will bring their collars and their sighs and their talk about civilization. We will bring a kitchen and a place where the boys can put their heads down without having to ask permission.”

“And me,” Hadran said, and I tasted copper behind my teeth and for a moment I hated the taste because it is what courage tastes like sometimes and I did not want to give that virtue to this man in this hour. He saw it. He did not flinch. “If I do not go, they will say I feared you. If I do, they will say I am soft and have been softened. Let them say. I would rather be called soft for a month than be the edge they take up without me to teach them to put it down.”

“If you go,” Tyne said, “do not stand where there are vines. You have a habit of believing vines cannot climb and they resent you for it.” She looped her string and set the cut end to sit on her shoulder where it could watch and sulk and adjust itself to being in her keeping. “And put a bit of salt in your pockets. Not for luck. For telling. You can make a circle that listens with salt if you have to, and all the good words will know where to go.”

The Anchoress flicked water from her fingers into the faces of the seven and they sputtered, then smiled, then remembered they were men in a room full of women and put on the faces they think do them credit. “Harm taught me my letters,” she said mildly, and that sentence sat in the middle of the floor like a stool. “It taught me which ones I was not allowed to write with and which ones I could use quiet without anyone seeing. Do not let harm teach the boys their letters. Teach them their letters and then teach them when to put their pens down. Do you understand me, Majesty.”

“I do,” I said, which in our language is not only assent but also a promise that I will move my body to make it true.

There were a hundred small things and ten large that needed doing in the next breath. The Mothers slid into the hive-work of it without making a show, which is their way and the great mercy of this kingdom. Sera sent women to the armory with a list of what would make sense when grandeur was less useful than wool. Mother Jona called for the cartwright with the smallest hands because he is the one who can make a wheel talk to a rut in spring and not break. Mother Vell took the river of refusals to the scribe with a bad back and told him to make three copies and keep one for his pillow with my permission. The bell-men unknotted and reknotted ropes in their large blunt fingers the way fishermen do when they are not allowed to talk about why.

Hadran and I stood a pace apart and let the room bustle around us so that the bustle would learn the shape of us again and then not notice when we were gone. He gave me the look he gives to ladders sometimes as if deciding whether he is the sort of man who will break his neck on them. “You did not kill me,” he said, too softly for anyone but the wood to hear. “I did not cut the rope.”

“This hour,” I said, and we were both cruel to ourselves by saying it plain. “The next hour will want something paid to it, too.”

He nodded and his mouth did the little line again, the new road. “When we go to the Twined Counties, I will walk ahead when we come into the square.”

“No,” I said, and my voice sharpened like a needle and then was sheathed. “You will walk with me. The boys must see a man choose to be beside and not before, and they must see a woman not hide behind a man whose shadow fits the ground as wide as yours.”

He laughed and for a heartbeat he was the man in the orchard again with ink at the edge of the ocean, a coat more color than fabric. “You will save them,” he said, tender as always and therefore making me angry at mercy itself. “Not with knives. With Weight. With telling them their hands are not tools unless they make them.”

“They will save themselves,” I said, and his eyes warmed a degree because he needs me to say it that way to believe I have not made myself the only door they can go through. “We will be the women who sit by the water and keep the little fires lit so that when they come back with their mouths full of bad explanations there will be tea to drink and no need for their hands.”

When the palace slept, it slept in the way palaces do when the world has moved a finger’s width and everyone hears the scratching behind the walls. We did not sleep. We made lists. We told lies to the lists and crossed them out and wrote truths we would regret and folded the paper and put it under the plates so it would pick up gravy and we would have to start again. At the very end, after the fire had done the charming trick of making charcoals look like advice, I went to my narrow room behind the tapestries and looked at the bread knife lying clean as if it had never cut anything more troublesome than crust. It is like that with tools. They refuse to be guilty for your sake.

I set the knife across the Book of Oaths so that neither could rise without the other and allowed myself the rudeness of a laugh none of the walls deserved. I thought of the boy at the river and the barrel and his hands that went up and came down empty. I thought of the baker’s boy and the way his throat had learned to swallow stone. I thought of the Lace speaking into air and believing air would listen. I thought of Hadran and the way love looks like a flaw you can stick a pin in. I thought of the Weight under seven ribs and tucked into one older man’s. I thought of my mother’s mouth when she put on the crown and said it was heavy in the defense of lightness.

Dawn did not happen so much as shrug itself into the window the next morning, and somewhere below our rooms the palace cats made the sound they make when mice have been unwise. Sera came to the door without knocking, and no door in this place now would begrudge her that. She wore travel like it was a sash. “We go at noon,” she said. “Tyne says she has a way to make the road forget to be ice under the cart wheels for a mile at a time if we feed her raisins. The Anchoress says bring salt. Hadran says bring a shirt he is not willing to ruin. The bell-men say they will walk or sit or stand and they will not ring unless you ask. Mother Vell says she has weighed the paper and it is heavier than yesterday, and she is pleased.”

“And you,” I asked, because you must always ask the soldier what they need when you can ask it in a room where they are not watching a door.

Sera put two fingers on the bread knife where it lay on the Book and did not lift it. “I need you to promise me,” she said, “that if a man raises a hand at you in the square at Dee or Halver or any other county whose pride tastes like a bad onion, you will not wait to see if he intends harm. You will duck. I will do the rest.”

“I will duck,” I said. “But we have taught ourselves for two hundred years to wait and see and decide what the intention was. It will be a long lesson to unlearn.”

“Duck anyway,” Sera said, and left before I could contradict her with something that would only have been pretty.

In the yard, the carts were already becoming stories. The Mothers had taken thread from the East Gallery’s runner and stitched it into the edges of blankets. Tyne had draped her impossible cut around her shoulders like a stole and it pouted there and occasionally reached for Hadran’s elbow and was smacked like a cat caught dreaming of the roast. The seven were there, unremarkable as chairs, which was their new work. They were to be seen without the costume of fame, and that would teach more than any sermon. Carrin’s mother came with a loaf that looked like laughter and handed it to Sera because she knows the way food moves through a camp and wants it to reach mouths that will not spend half of it telling a story about its crust.

When we set out, the palace did not weep as some have done when queens go to meet the portion of the world that likes to test itself on mortal flesh. It watched. It made a note of how many steps I took to the gate. It asked the gate to remember the pattern of my breathing so it could keep it safe in case anyone came back needing a reminder. The road to the Twined Counties is a long ribbon of compromise between hills that would rather not be flattened and riverland that will always be new-made in the spring. The air smelled like water inside stone. Women waved, men tipped their hats with an absent, worried courtesy that is every city’s heart when its stories are being rewritten a stanza at a time. A boy ran alongside until his chest hurt and then beckoned to his friend to take his place so that there would always be someone at our wheels to ask us in his own bird-bone way whether he might someday be allowed to be the sort of man we were making words for.

Halfway to the first mile-marker Tyne whistled through her teeth and the ice decided for a short stretch to remember what it has in common with glass and be smooth under our wheels. The horses lifted their heads as if they had been complimented. Hadran walked on my left and Sera on my right and we were three in a line that would look, to anyone who did not know us, like a woman well-guarded. It is a useful mistake once in a while.

“Do you think they will try today,” Hadran asked, looking at the sky as if it had opinions. “Or will they leave it as long as possible so that when it hurts they can say the wound was my idea.”

“They will try when they think the audience is best,” I said. “They will not pick the hour like a soldier. They will pick it like a playwright. Noon, or the last light before supper, when you can die and ruin a meal.”

“Then we will feed the town first,” Sera said. “We will have the ovens heated before we speak. No story goes in as deep on a full stomach. They will be forced to pay attention for the sense of it, not because they are dizzy.”

We came into Dee at half past the hour after noon because the road had not wanted to be quick and Tyne had told it that we were in no hurry to test its patience. The square there has always pretended it is round, a tangle of lanes pretending to be spokes. Men stood with their coats undone to show that they were not cold. Boys stood where they could see without being seen. Women placed themselves in the shadow of the bakehouse where they could judge the success of our words by the way the loaves fared. The Lace were there, collars like snow gone stiff where no one has walked. There were six of them. There was no ink-under-the-nails man, which pleased and disappointed me in equal amounts.

Hadran stepped forward a twin half-pace with me, and that quarter of a step is the difference between a story about a man who leads and a story about a man who will not let himself be pulled behind. Sera put the cart between us and the Lace because carts are better friends than any words if someone forgets themselves. Tyne went to the edge of the crowd and began the work of making eye contact with every woman who had ever threaded a needle in wind.

“We have something to ask,” I said, and the square liked that better than any speech that begins with We have something to tell you. I felt the rope choose to hum or not and the rope chose to hum. The Lace started their breath-patter and stopped because the crowd turned their heads first to me and then to Hadran and then to the ovens and decided all three were worth hearing.

“This is Hadran Vale,” I said, and the women nodded because they know the names of the men who sit at our tables the way they know which butcher is least stingy. “He believes men should be given back something they have not had to think about for two hundred years. He believes you will not be worse for holding it if I hand you this first.” I looked at the boys. I did not look at the men. Men get glossy when they think you are speaking to them. Boys listen. “Weight. Come up here and pick it up.”

They did, one after another, seven and then three more who could not stand it and then one who tripped on his own need to be good and skin his knee and cried and came anyway. I put the word into their mouths and watched it settle into their hands. Their fingers flexed, and the women watched their fingers and the Lace watched their faces and Hadran watched me the way a man watches a river he knows better than to try to dam and is going to walk into anyway. One of the Lace made the mistake of smiling when a boy flinched. The women near him caught the smile and held it there in a small silence until he straightened his mouth.

A man in the middle of the square took a step forward and opened his hands and I saw at once that he had not come to be convinced. He had come to be made a martyr in a poem he had already written. He had hungered for it so long his stomach had shrunk around it. He lifted his hand at me as if he meant to show me something about the sky and then he made it into something else while everyone was looking. The rope trembled under his skin the way a thought trembles when a person is about to tell a lie. I ducked without waiting for intention, and Sera’s hand was already in the place where his wrist would be before he knew he had put it there. She held him the way you hold a jar lid before you twist, still and even, and he sagged with the sudden knowledge of being contained.

Hadran stepped forward and did the thing I would not have let another man do and barely let him: he put his palm on the man’s shoulder and made his weight count. “Hold,” he said, and the word had the Anchoress’s iron taste in it though he has no herb-bundles for tongues. “See. See yourself. Do you want to make a story that a child will have to be taught to be ashamed of, or will you make the one where the child says my father was offered a knife back and he put it on a shelf and used it to cut bread when his neighbor came.”

The man shook. His face made the awful movement of someone who has imagined an act so many times his body did not know how not to do it when the moment arrived. Then his eyes found the women at the bakehouse and the women did not flinch. His hand sank without falling. He opened his fingers like a boy who has been told he may hold a bee if he does not close his hand upon it. The Lace made a dismissive motion and the crowd looked at their sleeve, not at their face, which is a wound men like that cannot stitch without blood.

“Weight,” I said again, so the word would make a path between us all, and in saying it I felt it lay itself across my own collarbones. It was not a burden. It was a garment. It sat correctly. It was not chain. It was not lace. It was a woven piece of something that could do either, and we would decide.

We spent the afternoon doing what women have always done when men want to make philosophy of something that is only behavior. We fed them. We put our thumbs on the scale of stories. We whispered in ears we had no right to and made those ears the sort that remember. Tyne put down her loops in the dirt where boys’ feet would tangle and then not trip because she had taught the knot to be lesson and not trap. The Anchoress took two stones out of the river and told them their names and put them in places where you could sit without having your thoughts go off crooked. The Mothers wrote refusals until the paper would have burned if anyone struck a match. Hadran spoke to the Lace in little pieces, a man whittling away a pride he had once shared and no longer wanted to carve his furniture of. Sera stood with her back to me and counted the ways out and then the ways in and then stopped counting and ate an apple because hunger cannot keep being ignored just because the world is being remade.

At dusk the bell-men took up their ropes and did nothing. The doing-nothing was an art. The men in the square saw the ropes in their hands and felt their own wrists in answer. The Lace saw them and saw history leaning and could not decide whether to shove or put a shoulder under. The day went down into itself like an old woman sitting in a chair she has owned longer than her husband. The rope at the edge of the world hummed twice and then rested, which is not the same as sleeping. The Weight settled. It settled in a way that told me we had not made a law. We had started a habit.

At the very end of light a boy with a face unknown to me except as the kind of face boys have when they have done something larger than their hands came to me with a coin in his palm. He held it out gravely. “For the Weight,” he said. “For the buying of it, if it costs. My mother says nothing is free that is worth anything.” The coin was dull and stamped wrong and precious because of both.

“It costs,” I said, and put my hand over his so his coin would not fall. “You will pay some, and I will pay some, and your sons will pay less if we do it correctly.”

He nodded as if we had settled a matter of bread. Then he grinned, ungovernably, and ran, and tripped over one of Tyne’s soft knots and did not fall, because of course he did not. That is how the lesson goes in the years when you can afford it. That is how you build a world where men are not harmless and also are not harm. It is not lace and it is not rope. It is the uneven weave of a cloth we have to wear to market and to war and to dinner with our mothers both, and call beautiful not because it is beautiful but because it holds.Chapter Seven

The morning after Dee tasted like clean iron and bread crust. The square had learned a new posture overnight; men stood with their hands in sight, not because anyone had ordered them to but because the Weight made them curious about their own fingers. Women went about their work with the sewn-in pride of having watched boys swallow something that wasn’t sweet. The ovens sighed as if they had slept better than they deserved. Before we left, a girl with a ribbon in her plait came and touched the hem of my cloak not for blessing, she said, but to see if queen-cloth felt like the coarse wool her mother boiled. I let her and told her the truth: it feels like anything you have to tend.

We took the road to Halver under a sky that had decided clouds could be borders and not only decorations. Sera surveyed the hedges as if they were soldiers who might forget themselves and turn, and Tyne walked with her string wound up tight, the cut end tamed into a sulk. Hadran had made himself plain again, plain in the way a very well-made chair is plain until you sit in it and discover it was carved by someone who loved spines. The seven walked as if they had learned a small song that would not stop humming at their bones; they did not speak of it, and that was its first good sign. Carrin tried and failed twice to whistle, and on the third try chose not to, and that was another good sign.

The road east of Dee undulates like a well-bred woman trying not to show she is laughing. The fields held their stubble up in stiff fists. We passed one farm where an old man was teaching a black calf to follow a rope instead of its own impression of freedom. He tipped his head to us without a bow, measuring us against his great-grandfather’s stories. The calf looked at Tyne with the wild calm particular to animals who have not yet learned words and saw only a woman who preferred not to be kicked. It is a good thing to be seen for that much and no more.

Halver sits where the water pretends it has two minds and then runs on as if the decision had been its idea all along. The mill there leans because of wind, not because of neglect; it is the sort of lean that says if you push me I will push back, and mothers like it because children take their measure against it and go home proud. The square is hung with ropes year-round, for hauling grain bags and children in baskets up onto the creaking gallery when the river feels celebratory. In spring, people tie bells to those ropes and for a day the whole place sounds like iron geese.

They had seen us coming. The Lace were already in the square. These were not the men from the palace; collars travel faster than people when men decide they are a uniform. They had brought a wooden frame with them, a kind of table with no top, with a scaffold for hands the way old surgeons’ beds had for ankles. Someone had swept the square too clean. It is never a good sign when dust is too polite.

“We’ve called it the Petition of Hands,” one of them told Hadran, as if he were sharing the name of a new pastry he claimed to have invented. His smile made his cheeks into parentheses. “It is danced everywhere that matters. Men place their hands here and say aloud that they are not children, and the rope moves. No blood. No drama. Civilization.”

I do not know why the word civilization from such mouths always makes me check my pockets. Sera’s glance brushed the scaffolding and did a calculation that I could have written down in inches. Tyne ran two fingers along the wood and grimaced and put her fingers in her mouth and bit them, and then winced because she had bitten more than finger. The frame remembered splinters already. It had been built to keep.

Women stood along the mill side like books on a shelf that will not fall unless you remove the one in the middle with malice. Boys held themselves proud as brooms. The seven took in the square with a quiet that made the Lace impatient. Hadran stepped beside me and did not speak; it is a gift, that shared silence right before someone sets a stage alight. The miller’s wife stepped out from under the gallery and set a stool down without looking up. “If speech is to happen,” she said, “someone ought to be above the elbows of it.” She meant me. She meant Hadran. She also meant herself.

We climbed. The Lace arranged themselves below us and made approving shapes with their eyebrows, the way men do when they believe they are about to be complimented in enemy language. The square held its breath the way a baker holds air in dough under a cloth.

“I have seen this Petition,” I said, before any collar could lay a ribbon of sound over my mouth. “It has prettier names in other towns. Men put their hands on a table and pretend the world is made of tables. We have brought a different piece of furniture. It is smaller. It fits in the mouth.”

Some of the men laughed because they had been boys in kitchens with women who make jokes with knives. Hadran put his hand on the stool, palm down, as if committing to stand where he stood. “They will not ask for your names,” he told the men in front as one speaks to the way a room arranges itself rather than to its furniture. “They will ask for your hands. They will tell you your hands are their business. That is how it begins.”

“Begin your ending, then,” the Lace said, prim as a nursery governess. He gestured at the frame with a little bow that was meant to be courteous and had only vanity in it. “We can do this without quarrel. We can each do our thing. The men will choose. You, Majesty, may make a speech about Weight. We will offer a Petition. This is not war. This is culture.”

The miller’s wife made a small, private noise, the kind you make when a man tries to walk across your clean floor in muddy boots while telling you he is saving you the trouble of mopping later. Tyne folded her string into a loop and looked at the sky for a bird she did not expect. The Anchoress had not yet come; the smell of mint and iron was not in the air. That meant we had to begin with less theater than I like.

“All right,” I said. “Let the men see both tables. We will start with ours.”

We put the Weight into the mouths that asked for it. It had settled since Dee. It had decided it wanted to taste like copper and honey both, and men licked their lips after and were surprised by sweetness where they had braced for metal. A boy with freckles that had learned to be one constellation closed his eyes when I said it and then opened them wide as if he had been kissed by someone he liked and been told he had not disappointed her. Two older men shook their heads and stepped back and no one hissed. That was important. The point of a rite that has a mouth is to leave room for refusal without the refusing becoming a sport.

Then the Lace called their first man. They chose one who was not loved. It is the oldest trick. If he falls, few weep; if he stands, few are brave enough to say he was not the right kind of person to have proven anything. He had a butcher’s hands and a gambler’s eye and a limp made from a winter not long enough ago. He put his palms to the wood with a disdain for his own skin I have seen in men who believe only product counts. A Lace man—he had bony hands, the kind that know small knives and large ledgers—tied a loop of pretty cord over the butcher’s wrists. He spoke names. They all like to speak names; they build ladders out of them and climb into thunder.

The air shifted. It wasn’t the rope under the world, not yet. It was the smaller rope, the one in men’s elbows, the one that had been singing the same note in this country since the mothers and the Weavers made their agreement with the river. The butcher’s mouth tightened. His nostrils flared the way a bull’s do at a fence. I saw the thought begin: I would like to test. I saw his next thought: I would like to test on the nearest thing that will make a story. Then the cut end, the tame sulk on Tyne’s shoulder, wriggled and tried to make itself useful from a distance like a dog that thinks it should be guarding its master’s pride. Tyne flicked it and it remembered sulk.

“You may lift your hand,” the Lace intoned. “Lift it and feel how you were made. Lift it and acknowledge your adulthood. Lift it and—”

Sera coughed. It was a cough with opinion in it. The butcher lifted. His wrist rose. It did not rise all the way. It was like the day a boy tries to lift the heavier pail and learns where his strength stops without shame. The butcher blinked. The Lace man smiled, oily as broth you have decided to skim. “There,” he said. “There. You feel? The rope is not gone. It is slackened. It will not insult you anymore. It will ask you if you are sure and then you will answer yourself.”

The butcher looked at the nearest boy. He did not hit him. That was not the test. He made a fist and then looked at it as if it were a pet he had not known he owned. He pulled his hand free of ribbon and stroked his knuckles and laughed. It was not an evil laugh. It was worse. It was relieved.

I could have told him a story then. I could have said, This is how addiction enters a house, not with a smash, but with a sigh. But stories thrown at relief fall to the ground and snap like cheap bread. The women under the gallery did what they always do when a man learns a thing he should be ashamed of enjoying: they looked at each other and began to decide whether they would carry this hour like a stone in their apron or grind it down to meal.

Hadran spoke instead. He stepped forward onto the gallery edge so that if he fell he would break his own pride and not anyone else’s. “A game is not a law,” he said, and the butcher looked up because men who gamble respect that sentence. “They are showing you that your hands can lift. I am telling you that if you lift them in anger, there is now a word in this town that will get heavier in your mouth every time. Don’t spit it out. Swallow it. Be proud of the weight it gives you. Be more proud than you are of the lift.”

The Lace chose another man. They chose better. This one was beloved. He had a toddler’s sock tied to his belt as a charm and three times on the way to the frame a woman not his wife touched his shoulder because she wanted to be part of his outcome. He placed his hands as if he were praying. The rope in the world made a small inquisitive noise like a bee that has found a cup of milk. The man looked at me. He looked at Hadran. He looked at the miller’s wife. She tilted her chin. It was the sort of tilt that says I can and I will forgive you once if you do the thing I need you to do first.

He lifted. His hands came up not far at all. He breathed as if he had just bent to pick up his sleeping child and discovered he had not lost his back. He began to cry, not because of the rope or the Lace or the Weight, but because of the feeling of being looked at while his body decided what sort of man he might have to be in a month he could not yet see. He put his hands down. He whispered, “Not today,” as if to himself. The Lace’s mouth went tight with the pain of being called decorative by a beloved man.

“Now ours again,” I said, and the square shifted the way a bed shifts when the weight on it evens out. We gave the Weight to three more and withheld it from one who, when I touched his pulse, had a tremor under his skin like a frightened animal in a trap. “Tomorrow,” I told him, and he nodded and went to stand by the cart so Sera could lean the look she uses on men who gnaw their own feet without noticing. Tyne set a loop down around the frame’s leg without anyone seeing, so that anyone who came to it would find their first step slowed for no reason they could brag about. The Lace saw the loop and decided not to see it. There is a type of magic that works best when unacknowledged.

When the Anchoress came, she did not come to the square. She came to the river. The smell of mint walked into the wind and found us. The bell-men felt it in their hands on ropes and one of them, who had been a boy in Halver and had rung the iron geese once at summer, looked up and met her eyes halfway across the distance and changed his mind about a small thing he had been unkind about, and I will never know what it was, and that is the graciousness of her work. She sent a boy with a message: In your second mouth, say the word you do not want to put out into air and ask that it be given a second meaning. It will not lose its first. It will make you two-breathed instead of once.

There are words a queen does not like to own. There is one, particularly, that I have used in courts when bread and knives and ordinary speech could not do the work. No had been enough all day. I did not want to use it here, in a square where men were watching their mothers’ mouths, not mine. But the Lace had seen the way the Weight settled and they began to speak their breath-pattern with more insistence. They had brought a boy. He had the look of someone in a story told to make the beating of a drum seem noble: narrow shoulders, proud chin, large eyes that had not yet been used. He was a clerk’s son and a cooper’s grandson and sorrow had not yet visited his bed. They had chosen him well.

He went to the frame and put his hands to it like a person putting his face to the first frost. The Lace made their sound. The rope came like a lazy river and set his elbows to hum. He smiled, tentative and proper. It was the smile he would have given a girl in church if he had been allowed to walk her home. Then one of the Lace leaned in to whisper in his ear and the smile went sideways. I saw the whisper. It was the shape of a small instruction: Look at her.

He looked at me. It is not often boys look at me with the intention of harm. Hatred, I have seen and known; disgust when I have refused to be a table, yes. But intent is a colder thing. It takes people aside and tries to flatter them into believing they are central. The boy looked, and the rope offered, and the Petition required him to prove something I did not want him to learn tonight.

I stepped down from the gallery. Hadran made a small motion with his hand and Sera ignored it like a queen. Tyne’s string prickled. The boy’s shoulder tensed. I walked into the circle he could reach. I did it because if he learned tonight that it is easy to become a story by swinging at a figure on a stool he would spend the next year looking for stools and forget that houses are better work.

There are two ways to stop a first blow: with another blow, or with a thing that makes a person unwilling to be seen making a mistake. I used the second and put my voice where the boy would have to swallow it to hear it.

“No,” I said, not the court No, not the mother No, but the other one, the one that we use only when the river is rising and we want the water itself to check its boots for mud. The word hung between us like a wet rope. It might have slipped. It did not. His arm stuttered in the air, elbow grimacing.

“No,” I said again, and the word looked at itself and made a second meaning in my own mouth as the Anchoress had told me it might. No became not a prohibition but a line of chalk drawn before a fall that hurts less if you see where you were meant to stop. “No, not because you cannot. No, because you are not going to be the kind of man women teach children to fear by name.”

He cried. Men do that. It is a mercy to witness it and not make a song immediately. His cry had the sound of someone tasting salt for the first time; he looked bewildered that his mouth had made it. He took his hands off the wood as if it had grown teeth. The Lace started forward, hands making doctrine, and Hadran put his palm up, the bell-men shifted their ropes, and the women under the gallery drew breath in a unity that made the square twice its size.

“You saw it,” Hadran said, to the Lace, to the man with the gambler’s eye, to the butcher, to the beloved man and to the ones who had scuffed their boots and come only to see. “You saw that the rope moved when we asked it to move and did not move when he asked it to become spite. If your work were mercy, I could forgive you your vanity. But your work is a trick and tricks cannot hold a city.”

They did not try the Petition again. They are not fools, the Lace, only the kind of clever that thinks cleverness is a ladder out of grief. They packed their frame with pretty, brisk efficiency and to their credit did not tell the boy he had failed them. They will tell him later, in private. They will tell him he failed himself. He will learn to protect his pride against them and maybe against better people too. We will have to untie that later.

The Weight settled into Halver that evening. It made men sit longer after supper, hands open on knees. It made two boys take the long way home so they could throw stones into the water and choose not to throw at each other. It made a woman whose husband had come home the night before with plans in his mouth and lace in his collar decide to move her valuables into a trunk with a squeaky hinge. None of it was a law. All of it was the sort of governance you get when people consent to look at their own shadows by lamplight.

At the mill, the rope hung down from the gallery and made a long letter in the air. The bell-men touched it and did not pull. The Anchoress sat with her feet in the river and hummed to the fish, which is a way of telling the city that the bottom things have been informed and are making their own arrangements. Tyne rolled her cut end up tight, the sulk now drowsy, and tucked it into the basket under her skirt as if it were a babe and not a trouble. Sera stood with her hands behind her back like a woman who expects to be taught temptation and intends to fail the lesson with honor.

Hadran found me under a balcony where ivy had taken upon itself to be handsome. He did that careful thing with his breath he does when he intends to ask me a question that could start a fire. He cleared nothing. He spilled nothing.

“Do you see now,” he asked, very gently, “that the rope can move without turning us all into wolves.”

“I see,” I said, because truth must be honored even when it is uncomfortable, “that the rope is a person we have had to let speak at last. It will sulk. It will make errors. It will not rip itself free of every wrist today, and perhaps not for a year. I also see that a boy almost learned to love a way of being that would have made him too easy to write songs about. Your Lace would have kept him in a room full of echo. And you would have stood in front of the door and told yourself you were steering by letting them speak.”

“Will you still kill me if that is what it costs to keep the cut small,” he asked, and it was absurd, there under the sloped roof with ivy pretending to be a friend, how the question arrived and sat between us like a cat with one ear torn. It purred. It would not move.

“If the hour asks for it,” I said, and tasted blood because brave words always take some. “I will also marry a law and not a man if the Book asks that of me. I am built for both kinds of cruelty.”

He reached out as if he would touch my hair and then did the hard thing and did not. “You will be hated well,” he said, and it was not a curse. “Make sure your hating is of the right flavor. There are flavors that turn boys to vinegar.”

We slept at Halver in the miller’s second room, which had eel hooks hung on the wall like innocent questions. In the middle of the night I woke to the sound of bells being touched and not rung. The bell-men were walking the square with their hands on ropes, reminding the city in its sleep that it could wake and call if it needed. Sera breathed beside the door, not snoring because she thinks that would be prepared. Tyne talked in her sleep, not to anyone, not in any tongue but the one string uses to forget it was once hair or worm.

At dawn the square had grown families. Men came with their fathers not to be taught how to lift but to learn how to sit again. Mothers watched boys and wished on them. The Lace were gone, which does not mean they had left; it means they were rethreading. The miller’s wife brought tea that had been told to listen. The Anchoress had written a word in the frost on the rail that meant Do not tidy this away and then waited while the sun made a liar out of her handwriting.

We had to go on. These towns nest like bowls, Halver into Seft, Seft into Little Jar, and at the bottom there is always one cracked basin that will swallow what is poured and not admit the taste. If we could teach the Weight to sit there, I could come home and talk to my ceilings without wanting to rip their fake stars down and dress us both in rags. The Mothers counted heads. The bell-men coiled and recoiled. The seven shouldered the invisible. Hadran stood like a man who had persuaded himself that it would be quality to walk into a room full of his enemies and smile.

We did not make Seft before noon. A message found us on the road, carried by a girl with boots too big, carrying them as if she held a bird that required telling. She put her palms together when she reached me, not to pray—to cup a thing. “Majesty,” she said, with my name under it where courtesy is meant to be, “a bell was rung in the city. Not by the bell-men. By the Lace. They have stringed the belfry at the Chapel-of-Not and they made it sing your name. People heard it and did not know where to put that sound in their selves. Some are frightened. The High Recorder says it was an accident. The cats say it was a dare.”

The road leaned around us. The horses lifted their heads as if someone had whistled into their shoulders. Sera’s hand found the place in the air where her hilt would be and behaved as if she had already gripped it. Tyne’s face went still and then radiant with a particular fury that is not angry at men; it is angry at lies. Hadran’s mouth made that new road and then the hint of a smile broke across it like a cart pushed too fast over ruts. “He has courage,” he said, almost approving, “to make the Chapel say anything.”

The Anchoress’s rope finds everything. She had touched the bell. The Lace had forced it. There are things in a city you do not ring without consent. It is like drinking a woman’s river water without having been invited to sit. The insult was specific. It was meant for me and for her and for Tyne and for all the hands that had ever tied men gently to themselves. It was meant to say, We can make your tools speak against you.

“We go back,” Sera said, and I loved her enough in that moment to want to send her away and keep her safe. “We take down whatever string they hung. We make the bell ignorant of their pattern. We beat the High Recorder with his own pen.”

“Not yet,” Tyne said, so calm that the road considered being water. “If they have learned to make the Chapel talk when she did not invite them, they have a piece of the old weft in their hands. They can cut more cleverly than we thought. If we run, we will be running into a room where they have set all the chairs in ways that make knees bruise. We must make them come to us, to a square, to a rope we keep.”

“Seft then,” I said. “We make Seft a mouth that cannot mis-say. We feed it. We teach it the Weight. We call the cat to the door with our own tongues and make sure it cannot fit its body through the crack without smoothing its fur the wrong way.”

The girl with the boots too big stood waiting for a word to carry back. She had a bandage on one knee from a time when road and skin had disagreed. I put my hand on her head as if I knew her and perhaps I did. There is a class of girl who belongs to all women briefly before she belongs to herself. “Tell the Anchoress I will write into the Gallery when I can. Tell the bell-men to keep their hands around their ropes and not to pull. The bell must remember that ringing is a choice, not a twitch. Tell the High Recorder that if he says accident again I will set him to teach boys the difference between spilling and pouring until his tongue bleeds.”

She grinned and ran and did not trip because sometimes the road loves you for half a mile. We walked on. For a time the world was just steps and breath and the sound of the Weight learning to be worn in seven bodies and accepted in a dozen more. Carrin walked nearest me and once his hand lifted as if he would take my elbow when I stepped over a root, and then he put it down because he had learned the better courtesy. “You can take my elbow when we are old,” I told him quietly, and his face did that odd lovely thing men’s faces do when they are told there will be a future in which they are included.

Seft was smaller than Halver and larger than a secret. It had a square that was not a square but a corner, a place under a leaning house where gossip thought it was safe and had learned to lower its voice only a little. Children had drawn chalk ladders on the stones and taken turns falling off the bottom rung without injury, which is a craft. There was no Petition frame here. The Lace had not brought their furniture. They had brought something worse: a boy with a bell on a stick.

He was six. He held the stick as if he were doing an errand he should be praised for even if it was filthy. When he shook the stick the bell made a pretty insult. I have heard the pretty insult some men make when they are not ready to be alone with their reflection in a window; this was like that. Pretty and unkind in a way that expected not to be called a lie because it was lovely to the ear. The women had set their mouths. The mothers had tucked their children’s shoulders into themselves with a subtle narrowing of stance. The bell-boy’s mother, because there is always a mother, stood just behind him and watched with the dull terror of a person who suspects she has been paid in counterfeit and feels rude counting at the table.

We went to him. Sera stood so that any hand would find steel before it found me. The seven made lines in the crowd like stitches. Hadran kept his hands visible. Tyne flicked her string and the sound the bell made thickened and lost a note you would only notice if you had ever tuned a harp. I knelt because six-year-olds know who is speaking by who bothers to be their height.

“What is your name,” I asked him, and his mouth made the shape of a fish and then decided to be courteous. “Pell,” he said, and it was a good name, a round one, the kind you write on the inside of a cap. “Pell,” I said, “what does the stick ask you to do.”

“Shake,” he said, with the avid pride of civil service. “Shake and walk where the men with collars tell me.”

“What would you like to do,” I asked. His mother made a noise. It was the same noise as the miller’s wife had made, but smaller, like it had not had enough room in her. “Not that,” Pell said, staring at the bell with the despising fascination children have for things they are not allowed to break. “It sings like it is tickling. I don’t like that.”

I took the stick. I did not take the bell. Kindness to objects is a sort of health. The lace at its throat flinched under my hand. Tyne touched my wrist under her breath and shaped a loop in air and the bell forgot its prettiness for an instant and made the sound most bells make when asked a question: yes, if. I handed the stick back. “Find the fat cat that belongs to the woman with blue stockings,” I told him. “Tie the bell to the cat’s tail. If the cat lets you, she wants to listen to you. If she scratches you, she wants to listen to me. Either way, you bring the bell back to me before the shadows lie down.”

He ran to find the cat with the purpose of kings. The Lace did not like it. They do not like cats. Cats are contrary as voters and look at collars as if they are mice they have already eaten. A woman in a red kerchief laughed into her fist and turned it into a sneeze. The bell-men looked at their ropes and saw in them a promise and a warning.

We set Seft to rights as much as any hour lets you. The Weight went into mouths that had chewed poorer bread than Halver’s. Men swallowed and did not strut. A boy with a limp as old as his legs took the vow and stood taller in a way that made me want to knuckle the sky and thank it for remembering to feed his pride for once. Tyne set soft knots where a man would need to step if he wanted to bring his wife grief. The Anchoress was not with us, but her word had nested behind my teeth and I used it to untie one woman’s breath and let it fall into a sob that cleans without leaving the floor wet.

Pell returned with the bell without scratches and without cat. He held it out with both hands, solemn as a magistrate. “She let me,” he said, and his mother covered her eyes because there are signs you ask for and signs you cannot be ready for. “She let me and then she shook and shook and then she went to sleep and looked happy doing it.”

“Good,” I said. I tied the bell to the post under the leaning house where gossip lived and told it a story about listening and not merely speaking. The Lace did not like it and could not say why without admitting they prefer to shout into wells and hear their own voices return.

Late, when the square began to turn into a yard and the women into a kitchen and the men into chairs, Sera came to my side and did something I had only seen her do in war: she counted stars. They were not the East Gallery’s polite constellations. They were the kind devised by people who go outside to be alone. “If they have learned to ring our bells,” she said, “they have learned to make our cats sleep. That is not a trick I am willing to fight without a glove.”

“We will take the Anchoress back to her own bell and tell it it cannot be asked without an invitation,” I said. “We will teach the ropes in the palace to recognize desperation and not doctrine. We will put guards where no guard has ever stood: in the air between breath and word.”

Hadran stood on the square’s edge where most men stand when they are trying to decide whether they are necessary. He was necessary. He did the thing he does best: he talked to the men who had lost the evening, not the ones who had won it. He talked to the butcher, to the gambler, to the man whose wife had wrapped her hand around his wrist in public and dared anyone to say she was out of place. He said nothing kind and nothing unkind. He said useful things with a softness in them. He did not speak of the Lace. He spoke of bread and how hard it is to make it when the door keeps slamming because someone is testing their shoulders.

At the edge of the light Tyne’s cut end wriggled and, sick of sulk, made a small bright run for the gutter. Tyne was not looking. Neither was I. Carrin was. He made a sound like a scribe realizing he has misspelled a king’s name and lunged and caught the idea by the tail. It burned him. It did not scar him. He held on long enough for Tyne to clap her string around it and make it mind. He looked at his palm and then up at me, ashamed and pleased. “You held,” I said, and he smiled because sometimes single words are weight enough.

We slept in Seft on beds stuffed with river rushes that had been told to be quiet. In the night I dreamed that the Book of Oaths lay on my chest and purred, and when I woke I was half-convinced that loved objects are cats and that perhaps the easiest way to keep the Lace from using our tools against us was to give all of them personalities and small appetites and then make them fussy. It is not a policy. It might yet save a life.

In the morning we turned our faces homeward because the city had been rung without asking and the Anchoress had asked for my hand in her prayer as if it were a rope. We would go back through Halver and Dee and then the lanes that know us best, and I had already started composing my lie for the High Recorder and my truth for the bell. The seven moved with a sureness that was not swagger. The Weight had found its places in their bodies like tools hung on pegs.

A mile from Seft the hedgerow parted as if it were a curtain and a man stepped into the road. He wore a collar that had seen better shoulders. He carried under his arm a thing that made Tyne’s string stiffen and the horses toss their heads: a little box made to hold the idea of a bell. The Lace do not like to carry heavy things; they make light copies and ask the world to take them seriously. He was alone. It was a trick. Men like that are never alone. But he had come alone because there are gestures you make when you want to speak as if you are a person and not a collar.

“Majesty,” he said, and his voice was the sound of a man who has been told he is a credit to his profession and has not yet decided whether to be angry at the compliment. “Lord Vale. Mothers. Weaver. I have a thing you don’t want and cannot afford to leave in my keeping.”

“We have ladles and pens,” Sera said. “We are not poor.”

He smiled a minimal amount. “You have cats. You have bells. We have found the piece that allows either to forget themselves for as long as it takes a boy to be told to swing. We thought to use it as proof. Perhaps, instead, we will ask a price.”

“Shame,” I said. “That is the price.”

He blinked as if I had thrown a ball in a game he did not know. “Pardon,” he said, which I have always liked in men; it means they are asking you to say it again and not to forgive them. “Shame. The price of bringing your trick to our doors is that you will have to go home knowing we saw you with it. You will have to wash your hands and not tell anyone what came off. What do you want that I can pay in coin that does not ruin the city.”

He opened the little box and the air tasted like the first letter of a language I do not wish to learn. The Anchoress’s bell in the Chapel-of-Not would ring if this were brought within three houses of it. The cats would sleep if we tied this to their tails. The Lace had learned this part of our tongue just well enough to swear.

“Put it down,” Hadran said, and his voice had made up its mind to be rope, not law. The man hesitated. He did not look at me. He looked at Hadran the way men look at men when they are deciding whether to call each other by their personal names or their titles. “If you put it down,” Hadran said again, “I will let you walk away and keep your collar on your throat. If you do not, we will strip you and take your shirt for rags and send you home in a story you will hate. There are prices higher than shame.”

The man laughed a small, proud sound. “You threaten harm to make a point about preventing it,” he said. “This is what childishness looks like dressed in velvet.”

Sera took one step. You would have missed it if you were not trained to see how the world is held up by such steps. The man felt it. He put the little box on the ground as if it had learned to be glass. Tyne drew a loop in air and it settled around the box like a cat’s curiosity. “Walk away,” I told him. “Tell your friends it felt heavier than you expected. Tell them it was not a trick. Tell them we can make you ashamed without making you bleed.”

He looked at me then and I saw that he had thought of taking my hand, once, thirty years ago when he was no one and I was not yet a girl who steals cloves, and he had taught himself to prefer collars to thinking about the ways his life might have been shaped by love instead of by orders. He walked into the hedge and the hedge closed and Sera permitted herself one curse, the kind you throw after a fox, not at it.

Tyne crouched over the box and frowned in the way that means art. “It will unlearn itself if we feed it names,” she said. “It will forget how to ring us by whispering ‘house’ and ‘daughter’ and ‘cat’ to it until it decides it is sentimental. Then we can break it with a toe.”

“Do it on the road,” I said. “Do it where geography can watch. If the road learns how you untie a snare, it will pay it forward when girls walk.”

We walked home slower, mindful of the way cities bruise when bells are rung without consent. The Anchoress’s door would be shut or open depending on how insulted she had been by the Lace’s fingers on her iron. The High Recorder would have explanations shaped like plates. The Mothers would have turned their braids into letters. Hadran would have words to eat and words to cough up. Sera would have a new notch in her knife’s hilt, invisible to any hand but her own.

At the gate, the guard’s mouth was set in the shape men make when they have been told too many things that day and have not been allowed to punch any of them into better stories. He stood aside, respectful, not because of crowns but because someone had asked him his mother’s name while he waited and he had said it aloud and discovered he had been lonely. The palace smelled like bread and mint and the specific sulfur of arguments that did not burn but smoked.

In the Chapel-of-Not the bell was quiet. The Anchoress had braided herbs through its tongue and written a word on its rim that meant You will not be moved by anyone wearing lace. She looked at me with the unsentimental pity that saves us both. “They have learned enough now,” she said, “to ruin a small town. They have not learned enough yet to untie me. It would help if you wanted them to stop learning.”

“We fed Seft and Halver and gave them Weight,” I said, and sat on the floor because in that room all women sit on the floor and then stand up when they can. “We will keep doing that until the Lace find themselves strangling on their own collars when they try to speak a bell into disrespect.”

“Good,” she said, and handed me a string of knotted fennel and saffron to wear under my dress. “One thing more. Lord Vale will be asked, tonight, to put his hand to paper that would make you easier to remove. They do not need to murder you to quiet you. They can suggest a chair in a room you do not like and call it government. Men like to bury women in rooms. They call it honor.”

“They will not succeed,” Hadran said from the doorway, and the way he said it told me that he knew exactly how close success had come and what knife had been sharpened for the signing. He came into the chapel and did not sit because very few men have that permission. He stood with his hands hidden nowhere. “They will not succeed,” he said again to the bell, so it would remember.

The day tilted toward its end as if the earth were indulging its own habit. The city had become the place where all the decisions had already been made but not yet acted upon. Sera sent the seven to their beds with words about the morning that made them understand they had not graduated anything, they had entered apprenticeship. Tyne unlearned the box. The bell-men slept with their hands around private ropes they carry in their heads. The High Recorder arranged his knives of language on a platter and told himself we were all going to like the taste.

I set the bread knife across the Book again and imagined, not for the first time, what it would be like to go ahead and cut a person I love to save a city I love and a hundred boys I cannot yet name. I did not practice. Practice makes perfection and that is not a skill any person should possess for that particular act. I looked at my hands. They looked like my mother’s. They looked like the hands of a woman who has held rope and string and boys’ ears and bells and knives and the soft little bellies of kittens and the cold mouth of a cup in a narrow night. They looked capable.

“Weight,” I told them, and in the dark I felt the word settle at my throat and the rope under the world took it up and hummed the harmony. If the Lace were going to ring the bell of law in the morning, the bell would ring back a different note than they thought. If the High Recorder brought his platter to my table, I would bring mine. If Hadran put his hand near a paper, I would know it by the way the air moved under the door.

We run a city with strings and stories and bread and knives. We keep boys from playing with fire by teaching them to tend it. We keep men from breaking by allowing them, at last, to feel their edges and their substance both. The night did not forgive us. It never does. It nodded and let us sleep anyway, and in the last moment before the bell can decide what sort of day it will be allowed to usher in, I heard the cats make a sound like agreement. That was as much as I could ask and more than I deserved.Chapter Ten

The morning had the pale temper of a woman who has cried and washed her face and will not apologize for either. The palace woke around me with the caution of a cat walking through a room where glass has been broken but swept, an extra lift in the foot that has not been taught by any school. The bell in the Chapel-of-Not sat in its tower and pretended to be only iron, which is how iron behaves when it has been insulted and chooses to be dignified. I dressed with the deliberate care of a liar preparing to tell the truth, hands finding buttons they have known since childhood, hair braided in a pattern my mother taught me that tells the nape of my neck what country it belongs to.

Sera was already inside the door, the way dawn is already inside the window when you allow yourself to look. She had slept, or she had convinced her face to impersonate sleep with such armsmaster precision that I could not tell the difference, and that is its own kind of armor. She took the bread knife and slid it into its place beneath my cloak without fuss and without asking if I meant to carry it; we are past questions that can be answered with inventory. Tyne followed as if she had never left, string looped like an ostentatious charity around her wrist, the cut end tamed into a sulk so convincing I almost believed it forgotten its ambition. When the Anchoress arrived she brought the road-smell with her, the iron-and-mint that lives in old stone and new water, and she put her palm on the doorframe the way one greets a friend who has done something foolish and is forgiven in advance for confiding it.

They did not make us wait. The High Recorder sent his runner with a document wrapped around a pen as if it were the pen that needed warmth. The wax was broken before it reached me, not by any hand but by the stubbornness of a fold that had been told too many times to behave. The summons was written in his personal hand, which means the letters looked as if they wanted to be polite and would settle for being legible. He had called a Noon Session in the Men’s Court and invited me to bring witnesses, which is a way of saying, Come with your women and we will teach them chairs. It is also a way of saying, We have arranged the light.

“Bring the Mothers,” I said, because witness is not the same as audience and I would not give him the one when I could bring the other. “Bring the bell-men. Bring Carrin if he will come and the seven if they are ready to learn what rooms do to vows when marble is listening. Tyne, ask the Girls’ Choir to sit on the gallery and hum when it is polite to forget a word. Anchoress, if you can make the bells remember the difference between accident and invocation without making them proud of it, I would be grateful.”

Sera counted the doors without looking. She can feel a hallway change its mind. “We will use the South Stair,” she said, and when I raised an eyebrow she did not apologize for having been carried down that stair at twelve with her arm broken and her mind newly-made, and knowing which boards still prefer not to be surprised.

The Men’s Court is a room that has long ago decided the difference between reverence and vanity is in the height of the ceiling. Its walls carry a history of tapestries that have been prudent rather than honest, hunting scenes and ships on rivers and men looking out of windows at fields arranged for their gaze. It is a room where men have been taught to keep their hands at their sides, not because they are dangerous, but because they are expected to be seen. It is a room that believes it invented the air. The lace-collars had been seated by the time we arrived, not at the table, no, but along its edges like a border of pretty thorns meant to convince roses they were naturally contained. Hadran stood with the light in his face in a way that made him look younger, which is another trick of that room; it gives men back their first mistakes so that they can make them again with ceremony.

“Majesty,” the High Recorder said, breath shaped into consonants he must oil every morning with the grease of propriety. He did not bow. He has learned the bow is an admission of spine and not an automatic mechanism, and he hoards such admissions for his own uses. “Lord Vale. Mothers. Weaver. Anchoress. Bell-men. Young men of the city. This is a Session convened under the Charter of Good Order to consider a petition from the Gentlemen of Lace and certain members of the Council regarding the advisability of revising the Quiet.”

He said advisability the way a doctor says leeches or a father says perhaps to a child who has asked to climb the roof. It is a word with grease on it. He gestured to one side and a scribe with careful hair unrolled a paper that had been waiting to be read at a temperature human mouths do not usually sustain. “The Petition,” he said, “proposes an Interim, during which the rope will be—what phrase did you use, Lord Vale?—‘asked to slacken,’ under supervision. The petitioners propose an oversight committee, six men and three women, to ensure that this slackening does not cut the city, to monitor effects, and to recommend legislation to codify what cannot reasonably be expected of one sex and what must now be asked of the other. The Queen would be pleased to appoint the women. The Gentlemen humbly offer to provide the men.”

There was a sound like bread being torn by hands that are trying not to break the crust. I did not look at the Mothers; they do not require my gaze to become relevant. I looked instead at Hadran, because the word Interim had settled on his shoulders as if he had invited it to sleep there. He did not look ashamed. He looked the way a man looks when he has brought home an animal with a broken leg and intends to set it and then release it and has already begun to love it without asking whether it bites. He had not signed. I could taste the ink unspent in the air around him. The High Recorder’s pen had ambitions; it had been thwarted.

“If you propose oversight you had best propose under-sight,” Mother Vell said before I could tell my breath how to sit. Her voice does not require a stage to find its audience. “You have convened us in a room that has always known how to count men and forgotten how to count women. That is a poor beginning for anyone wanting to measure a habit as complex as harm. The East Gallery would have sufficed, had you wanted any answer but the one you are prepared to hear.”

A murmur went up and was tamped down by the Lace’s collars, which have learned to do that to people on their behalf. The High Recorder smiled the mild, irritating smile of a man who does not mind being corrected if it gives him another chance to speak. “Mother Vell,” he said, and the softness on the mother was not the kind that admits kinship. “The Gallery will have its time. The city will sing of this day in the terms the Men’s Court provides it, and I am entrusted, by the Book, with the care of that song’s meter.”

“You are entrusted with ink,” I said, and the court made a small sound, as if a chorus of throats had been pinched lightly in surprise. “The Book is older than your hand and it does not prefer you. The Book can learn Weight as well as men. It can learn to settle, too. If you want an Interim, we can discuss it, and we will do it under a vow that does not belong to the Lace.”

The High Recorder’s face did the smallest of things—one eyelid blinked out of time with the other—and I took the liberty of liking him for it. He is often the only person in this room who remembers that rooms are made and do not descend on us like weather. “Then propose your vow,” he said. “Let us hear what you have taught men to carry that can be weighed and verified and punished if dropped.”

Tyne made a low, satisfied noise like a cat whose favorite chair has just admitted it enjoys being clawed. The seven, ranged behind the Mothers like punctuation, straightened without looking orchestrated. Carrin’s smudge was a fresh shadow on his wrist; he had not been to ink yet this morning, which means he had come to us without stopping to be useful to any man’s piece of paper. The bell-men stood with their hands empty and their wrists full of memory. Hadran stepped one step back and one to the side. He knows when to be human furniture and when to be the knife in a kitchen no one admits to.

“The Weight,” I said, and the word once again settled into the room the way flour settles into the air when someone sensible sifts it in a doorway. “You have heard of it since yesterday because it was invented then. That is not a weakness. Bread was invented once and we have eaten it all our lives. Men have taken it into their mouths and it has not choked them. They carry it now under their ribs and in their hands. It makes choices heavier. It does not prohibit. It remembers. It asks, each time a hand lifts: will you be this man. It does not let that question be rhetorical any longer, Recorder. It counts.”

“How does it count,” the High Recorder asked, and if his smile had been oil before it was olive now, sharp and nourishing if you can afford to pour it on everything. “Who keeps the tally. If a citizen chooses to refuse the Weight, is he a criminal. Is a refusal after acceptance a crime. If a refusal before acceptance is punished by anything but social disapproval, how is this not only a prettier rope.”

“Write,” Mother Vell told him, and he had the grace to bite a smile and obey. “If a man refuses the Weight we will write it and not punish him. If a man takes the Weight and refuses it later we will write it and not punish him. If a man harms with his hand when the Weight is in his body we will write it and we will not punish him by cutting his hand off. We will punish him by making the work he does henceforth set on his palms. We will make him carry. He will carry water to houses where women have been carrying all his life. He will carry old men kind enough to be heavy. He will carry children from fires lit by the carelessness of men like him. He will carry until his arms know the story they tried to unlearn. This is law enough for a city that has learned the difference between rope and leash.”

The Lace hissed like collars when a cat’s hair is stood on end. They smelled the loss of their Petition in her plainness. The High Recorder’s pen tangled itself briefly in the coil of his hand, tripped, then found its line. Hadran made no motion and yet the room adjusted itself to anticipate it. The Mothers had brought their baskets of little outrages and laid them along the benches like offerings for a god that eats bureaucracy.

“If we monitor an Interim,” Hadran said, finally, stepping forward as if the floor had forgotten he could, “then we must monitor it under the Weight. The rope will be asked to slacken where it will not break. We will do it where we can see the square and where the bell can be asked to ring if a man forgets his mouth. We will not do it with frames or petitions or boys with sticks. We will do it with women with pens and men with bread. If the Lace wish to be present, they may learn our language or sit in quiet and hear it. If the Recorder wants a committee, let him name it, and let the High Recorder record refusals with the same industry with which he has recorded taxes. If in a month we have more refusals than harms, we shall continue. If we have more harms than refusals, the Interim ends and we go back to the last mercy that worked and call this one an error we will not repeat. That is my offer.”

It was a good offer. It was also a trap, but the kind you lay out of open rope and ask a man to step over with you, the kind whose only teeth are the teeth in a mouth that speaks because it is theirs. The High Recorder considered, and his gaze did me the courtesy of meeting mine and not questioning me with Hadran’s face. He does not like us. He does not hate us. He wants a city that will not embarrass him in front of his grandchildren and he will chew his own fingers to keep us from making him a fool before them. That is an honest motive. It can be used.

“This is jurisdiction,” he murmured, half to the table and half to the Book, because men like him often speak to paper when they are negotiating with their own nerve. “The Interim will require a General Writ. The Writ will require a Reading. The Reading—this is all theater, your Majesty.”

“All governance is theater,” I said. “The difference between us and the Lace is that our props do not pretend to be instruments of God. We use bowls and ropes and books and chairs and no one thinks they descend from the mountain carrying a cloud.”

He allowed himself to laugh once, brief and sharp as the snap in a hem. “Very well,” he said. “We call a Reading. The Writ will be set. The Interim will begin under the Weight. We will not call it a slackening. We will call it a Listening. I will put the petitioners’ names in the margin of the Writ in case anyone wants to sing of them later. It is only fair. I ask this one indulgence in return.”

Sera stiffened before I could. She knows the taste of indulgence; it is the same as the taste of men who try to hand you the knife and then forgive you for using it. I looked at the Recorder and he showed me his teeth, which is to say he trusted me enough to risk having them counted. “Say it,” I said, because women like me are always asked to say yes before we have been told what the price is, and sometimes saying yes first is the only way to make men speak their price as if it were negotiable.

“You will sign the Writ,” he said. “As queen. As woman. As Mother in law. You will write your name in a place where it can be erased only by fire. When men make a mistake under this Interim—because there will be men, because there will be mistakes—they will not say ‘the Lace did this.’ They will not say ‘Hadran Vale did this.’ They will say, ‘the queen asked this of us.’ And if we stop this Interim because we see more harm than refusal, it will be your hand that lifts and your mouth that stops. In short, the head that wears the Weight will be yours. Will you carry it.”

I could have laughed then at his cleverness, or wept at the honesty of this model of power. He wanted to tie the failure to me, and if it failed he wanted to blame me with comfort; if it succeeded he wanted to say we did it together under his pen, which is the only god he serves. Both are the ordinary prices of a century adjusting its collar. I did not look at Hadran, because he would have given me permission and I did not require it. I did not look at the Mothers, because their eyes would have been bread and I would have bitten them. I looked at Tyne, who made a small, delighted face at the word head, as if she had been waiting to be asked to put a crown on a problem.

“I will sign,” I said. “You will write. The Lace will sit with their hands visible. Hadran will stand beside me, not behind. The Mothers will count refusals and teach the city arithmetic. The bell-men will hold their ropes and not pull unless a cat runs, and if a cat runs it will be because someone kindnessed it, not because a box was opened without an invitation. The Listening begins at dusk. Let the city hear itself.”

The High Recorder bowed then, honest as a tree falling after long consideration. He went to the Book and set a page with his particular neatness, and I put my hand on the table because there are corners of the Men’s Court that pretend not to understand that women have hands. The Lace did something like a nod among themselves; it is a gesture used by people who have learned to agree without committing, who prefer the sensation of consensus to the reality of being bound to it. Hadran stood where he had promised to stand, the weight of his consent making the floor remember that men can share.

The Reading was theater. It was also surgery. The High Recorder read the Writ’s long, boring lines aloud with an art that made boredom sharp. The girls on the gallery hummed at the vowels the way bees hum at peony hearts, a good noisy fertility that embarrassed the room into being honest about what it was breeding. The Mothers stood with their hands in their baskets and did not pretend to be surprised by any clause that belonged to law rather than justice; they are professional un-suprisers. The seven watched and did not flinch when my name went onto the page and had the little blue moment of permanence as the ink bit into old fiber and became not surface but substance.

At dusk the city came to listen. They came not to be improved; people rarely set out from their doors to be altered. They came because the bell had not rung for them and they did not like it. They came because boys had gone to bed the night before with a new taste under their tongues and had woken wanting more. They came because Lace had been seen carrying furniture through squares and no one in this city allows new furniture to be arranged without commenting on the legs. The East Gallery had been set for the rite as for a supper that would feed both the hungry and the greedy. The Book sat with the knife across it like a cross on a loaf. The runners from Dee and Halver and Seft had brought back stories that knitted themselves together in the seams of the city like beeswax between a candle and its wick.

We began with the Weight. We always begin with the thing that will be misunderstood later. Men came to take it and to refuse it, and we wrote both and praised both by not making praise into a prize. The Mothers did the work the High Recorder will never be paid for, the work of noticing that a refusal made with fear can be more promising than an acceptance made to impress. Tyne set her soft knots in the places where a boy could trip without shame. The Anchoress made the bell yawn once, briefly, and then sleep with a full belly so that if anyone tried to tickle it with boxes it would turn its face to the corner and pretend not to hear. Hadran took the Weight in his own mouth one more time in front of everyone, because men need to see a hand do something twice before they will believe the first time was not a trick.

And then the Listening. It is a foolish thing to do, to ask a city to speak at once. We did not ask it. We asked the rope to learn a new song that is not a song in the throat but a hum in the wrist. We asked it to slacken where a hand has been taught not to climb, to test where a boy has been taught to watch. We asked it to leave in place the long prohibitions that have kept this country from being like some others we tell cautionary fireside stories about, including the one where the widow throws her husband’s body onto a cart with the laundry because she cannot mourn him and continue to survive. The rope is not an instrument. It is a person. When you ask a person to do a new thing you must wait longer than is comfortable while they decide to agree.

The first test happened under the statue of the man with a bird on his hand, the one that is supposed to represent knowledge, though my mother always said it looked more like a boy trying to figure out how to let go. A man jostled another man on purpose because he had always meant to and had been prevented by the small housekeeping enforced by habit. His elbow rose. It did not rise far. He looked around, confused. The Weight in three bystanders chose to hum for him without collapsing on his throat. Their mouths said no kindly, without that weaponized sweetness that teaches boys to hate the sound. He lowered his hand and the statue did not laugh at him. It would have, in other cities. The bird cocked its head and decided not to be made metaphor of. I felt that small refusal come into the East Gallery like a new brick being accepted into an old wall, sound traveling through structure in a way bones remember.

Not all of it was tidy. A boy in the market decided to see if the rope would answer to his name the way a dog eventually learns to. He brought his palm down on another boy’s shoulder, not hard, but with the intent of drawing a line. The other boy turned and put his weight into not returning the touch, and the onlookers cheered because they like theater better than behavior, and then were embarrassed because cheering made the boy who did the refusing taste his virtue like a coin and he grimaced. The Anchoress sent a breeze through the lane, cool as a mother’s forearm on a fever, and the embarrassment passed. We wrote that one. We wrote the boy’s name who tried. We wrote the one who refused. We wrote the cheer, because sometimes the chorus is the cause.

In the Men’s Court the Lace sat with their hands visible and their faces arranged in those delicate expressions men wear when an opera is in a language they do not speak and they pretend to be moved by the shape of it. One of them tried twice to make a pattern with his breath. The pattern snagged on Tyne’s loops and came away with a thread of its own silliness trailing from its hem. The High Recorder watched without taking sides, which is a side, and when he caught my eye he did not look away, which is not a truce, but it is a ceasefire, and I took it.

“Count,” Mother Vell said under the sound of it all, and the bell-men answered by laying their hands on the ropes in a rhythm that never pulled and yet made the whole palace count with them, a great machine made of wool and will that clicked politely at each refusal. It was ridiculous and it worked. Numbers are spells, women have known this since numbers were scratches on bone. We cast one that night in a room full of men who believed spells wore lace.

At the edge of the hour, when the Listening had begun to do what habits do when forced—fidget, make trouble in order to be noticed—we had our first harm. A man in the east quarter near the tanners’ vats lifted his hand to his wife in that aimless way some men have, not because he had decided to strike her but because his body had begun to forget how to be furniture and wanted to test being instrument. His wife, who had carried water and grief and weight and milk and law, did nothing. She did not flinch. She did not brace. She did not cut him in front of his neighbors with a look that would make a boy’s mouth sour. She held her own hand up, palm forward, and the rope under the city learned a new motion: it stepped between them without touching either. His elbow trembled and found itself returned to his side without shame. She kissed his knuckles and went on talking about onions. The neighbors did not cheer. The neighbors breathed out and turned, and that is the closest thing to applause I will allow in that lane this year.

We wrote it and did not write their names. We are not keeping a book of sinners. We are keeping a ledger of the ways a city chooses to hear itself. The High Recorder will hate that phrase when he hears it, and he will carve it into a law anyway because he understands the morphology of words better than some of the men who pay him. Hadran’s hand touched the table then and the Book, shameless, purred. He had done what he said he would; he had stood beside and not before. He would pay for it later with the Lace, in rooms I will not enter because I have no desire to give a chair my scent. That is our arrangement and it is good.

When the bell finally offered up a single note of its own accord, as if to taste the air and decide whether it was still the city’s, no one asked it to stop. The note that came was not the one the Lace had rung that morning when they made it say my name and would have forced my face upon the sound. It was the note a bell makes when it has chosen a person without telling them, a private little question that lets itself be overheard, an if. The cats in the palace lifted their heads and did nothing, which is the feline form of consent. The ropes hummed. The Book took the weight of my name into it without complaint. The High Recorder looked at me like a man looking off the edge of a cliff he had spent his life mapping, puzzled to find that the chart did not show the air.

After, when the wine had been poured and not drunk and the bread cut and not eaten because ritual has its own teeth to gnash, the Lace came with their price. They are relentless. If they cannot charge interest in coin they will charge it in inconveniences. A man with a collar that had learned to pity itself approached with a piece of paper folded into the shape boys fold when they intend it to fly and are ashamed to be caught playing. He held it out and I took it because paper is not a snake and men who think it is roll it in their collars and teach it poison. It was a letter from the provinces, crisp as chalk, from a county where we had not yet gone because there are only so many days and my body insists on an hour of quiet in which to be of use. The letter said, in the elegant hand of a woman who had been taught to make flourishes to please her mother, that a man had made a fist in public and no one had stopped him because they were waiting to see if he would choose not to hurt. He did not. The child he struck did not die. The woman who wrote the letter did not sign her name. She signed, “We will be counted.”

Sera read it and her jaw did a small useful thing. Tyne touched the paper and closed her eyes and found the hem of the county that had sent it. The Anchoress’s mouth twisted around a word she did not teach us in childhood and perhaps ought to have. Hadran took the paper and made himself meet my eyes and did not run. That is courage. It will not save him from my anger or from his own, but it is what men have when they are not harmless and do not choose to be harm.

“We go,” I said, before anyone could be noble at me. “We go at dawn. We do not wait to see if letters will multiply beyond the number of our steps like rabbits in a field neglected too long. We will be counted too. We will count the boy’s bruise and we will count the hand that made it and we will count the refusal that did not happen and we will teach the county how not to make that kind of counting necessary.”

The High Recorder looked as if he had eaten a stone and found it nutritious. “The Interim stands,” he said, and if he had wanted to say It ends he would have and I would have let him and then I would have come to his table at breakfast like a woman coming to lift the cat from a place it does not belong. “We will read the Writ in the morning to the city. We will send runners ahead to the county that needs us. We will do the counting in the open. If anyone tries to use your name as a bell again without asking, I will have his collar unthreaded and used to bind his tongue. That is not law. That is insult. I will not be made a clerk to insult.”

The Lace did not speak to that. They adjusted their cuffs as if their wrists had developed private opinions. Hadran closed his hand and opened it and looked at it as if it belonged to someone who had asked him to care for it for a season and would be back to fetch it in the spring. Sera lifted her chin and cataloged which straps would need replacing for a long journey where men might try to make the road rise up without evidence. Tyne wound her string around my wrist and hid a knot under the cuff of my dress that would hold a word I would need and not want to use. The Anchoress put a sprig of something that smelled like forgiven suspicion into my sleeve and called it a coin because she enjoys naming things the wrong thing and teaching them to answer anyway.

That night I did not sleep in the room with the false stars. I slept in the narrow bed behind the tapestries that smells like bees when it is hot and like stone when it is cold, because I needed a bed that would not judge me for being a woman that dreams of knives. I did not dream of the bread knife. I dreamed of a rope—not the rope, but a smaller one, the sort women use to tie up brushes in the scullery so the children cannot play with them and paint the cat. The rope was damp, and when I picked it up it left a mark on my palm in the shape of a letter I do not know. In the morning the mark was gone. The wanting to know was not.

At dawn the bell-men pulled once, which was not a ring and not a silence. The city turned over like bread in an oven and made ready to be itself in public. We loaded the cart with blankets that had been told to be warm in rooms that might not have walls. The seven came, not as heroes, but as men who know how to be useful without speaking of it. Carrin brought wax, which is to say he brought patience that can be lit. The Mothers parted the day like dough and made portions that fit in baskets. The High Recorder chose a pen with less vanity in its nib because roads are unkind to proud instruments. Hadran put on the coat that looks like ink about to become a sea and not like a lake pretending to be patient.

As we went out, the Chapel-of-Not exhaled and the blue of its shadows deepened without anyone’s permission. The Anchoress stood in the door and did not bless us, because she is not that sort of saint, but she looked at our feet and made them know the road better. Sera touched the bell’s rope and it remembered her hand at twelve, and it remembered her hand now, and it decided to keep both memories and neither would be used against her if the Lace tried to ask it questions beyond its appetite. Tyne’s cut end peered out of her basket like a spoiled child looking for trouble and finding only bread.

We left the city at a pace all cities bless, not too quick to make it think we were running from it, not so slow as to make it suspect we preferred the country. The road to the county unnamed in the letter is a long mouth of grudges that chews feet and spits out men humble. Weather had decided to be polite and then forgot itself halfway to the first marker, which is to say it rained, and then it did not, and then it thought about it, and we said thank you for each thought because you must thank weather for choosing where to spend its attention.

We were three turns from the boundary stone when a woman stepped into the road and made it hers without asking leave. She held a boy by the collar of his coat and his face was the face boys have when they have been caught doing a thing they had convinced themselves was brave. She did not look at the bread knife at my hip because she did not know it as a thing to be looked at. She looked at my hands. She looked at Hadran’s and decided he was with me and not herself and forgave him in advance for keeping to that side. She looked up at the sky and told it not to be foolish on her account.

“Majesty,” she said, and there was no onion in it, no village-bread courtesy, only a bone in the middle of the word that would not bend. “He hit his sister. Not because he was angry. Because he wanted to see if the rope would stop him. It did not. He did not hit her hard. That is a sentence I would rather die than say twice. You made a thing. Take it in your hand and show me how to hold it so that my son will not grow into a man who thinks he is a tester of women.”

I took the boy’s face in my hands and felt in my fingers the little delay boys' muscles have learned from the rope when they are about to do something and waiting to be caught. He was a child with a good mouth that had not yet learned to apologize without being requested to, which is promising or terrible depending on who you ask to teach him. He did not cry. He had cried already, I could smell it, the flat salt of a child who has found out he can and did and hates both.

“You are going to carry one thing all the way to the county and back,” I told him, and his eyes did not roll because his mother would have rolled them back into positions he could use at supper. “You will carry this.” I took the bell the Lace had given to Pell at Seft, the one our cats had deigned to listen to, and I tied it to his belt with Tyne’s string, and the bell considered being offended and then decided to be useful. “Every time you move wrong it will sing. You will hate it. Your mother will hate it. Your sister will laugh at you and you will learn that some laughter is the good kind that does not cut your throat. If you ask to take it off I will say no until the cat in the Chapel sings of its own accord, which is to say, not soon. This is not punishment. This is practice. Practice makes habit and habit is all that keeps any of us from being wolves when we are tired.”

The boy nodded because boys like carrying and dislike bells and love assignments you can tell a friend about later without lying. His mother’s mouth wrinkled into a shape that would have been a smile if someone else had been foolish enough to attempt it first. Hadran raised his eyebrow at me where the boy could not see and I raised mine back, and in that little exchange we allowed one another to be wrong together if it turned out we were wrong. The Mothers did not interfere. They know when the work belongs to a woman and a child and the rope and the piece of string that will be a story at dinner. The Anchoress breathed, and the rain decided to finish what it had started and then stop, which is all any weather can be asked to do.

The county’s stone was stained the old red you get when boys have made a habit out of climbing it to see who is taller. Beyond the stone the hedges had learned to grow in ways that keep secrets. The village there did not look much different from Seft or Halver or any place where the roads are taught to be polite, but its air had a habit in it I recognized from places where men have carried their fathers’ errors with pride because they did not have anything else to carry that made their backs feel necessary. The square had a frame in it already, not the pretty Petition of Hands from the Lace, but a heavy, honest thing used to hold down barrels when wind intends to make sport. The frame had a rope across it and a boy’s bruised name in the air above it. The women stood in a small clump like the sort of flowers men call weeds because they are not soft enough to look at while you wait for your stew to boil.

We walked into their air as if it were ours, which is how you convince a place to be generous. Sera nodded to the woman nearest trouble because Sera can smell where trouble goes to tie its shoe. Tyne looped a knot under the frame that would not trip the men, only their pride. The bell-men put their hands at their sides and remembered sound quietly. The Mothers arranged themselves so that any boy trying to show which man he might grow into would have to ask permission from three women he did not know by name. Hadran stood beside me and did not take one step more or less than I did. The Anchoress looked at the bull in the field and reminded it that ropes were made of grass, and the bull let the wind touch its ear and did not argue with it.

“You wrote,” I said to the women, because letters are serious and ought to be treated as such even when men are present with their furniture. “We came. Show me the boy and show me the man, and show me the place it happened if you can bear it. If you cannot bear it, show me where you want to sit while not bearing it in public.”

They showed me a threshold. It is always thresholds. Men make decisions there because the world is divided by a line and they think lines make them gods. The boy’s name was Hen, which made me want to protect him because hens are good creatures who do not deserve to be made metaphor of any more than birds on statues do. The man’s name did not matter, not because he was not important, but because we are not making a book of sinners. He stood and stared and I saw in him not a wolf, not a knife, but the hollow place where something had been kept from growing all his life and which had suddenly been given permission to sprout and was hurting him with its rude little green.

“Weight,” I said, and the word put on its working clothes and went among them, into seven mouths and three more that had never seen the Gallery and had still learned it second-hand because cities have better gossip than counties. The man refused it and I wrote his refusal and the Mothers praised neither the refusal nor their own restraint in not speaking into it. The boy took it and I watched his throat move and then watched him pick up his own name and put it somewhere safe inside him where no man’s hand could knock it off a shelf.

We did not use the Petition frame. We used the bell I had tied to the little tester’s belt and the bell that lives in women’s mouths when they say No and mean it kindly. The rope under the world did its new hum. The rope across the frame made a smaller, ruder noise, like a child burping at a funeral. Sometimes the world is instructive without my help.

The man lifted his hand, because he had come to see if his hand would obey him now, and because the Lace had told him hands humiliate a man when they refuse him, and because he had believed anyone who made an insult that pretty. He lifted and the rope did not stop him because the rope is not a god and not a law and not a mother. He lifted and the Weight in three men around him sang in their wrists and they put their hands out without grabbing, and one of the women under the gallery laughed the kind of laugh women learn to make when children fall down and are not hurt, a small snort that says, You are ridiculous and I love you and please do not do that in front of the good plates.

He put his hand down. It is an unglorious end to a story men like to make into duels. He put his hand down because putting it down is a thing you can do even in front of a county with a stone that boys have taught to measure. He put it down because the Weight taught him how much he did not want to carry instead of how much he wanted to lift. He looked at me and at Hadran and he hated us for a moment, which is a beginning for some men of a new kind of respect. He looked at his wife and saw her book-keeping eyes and understood that she would count this day as profit if he did not ruin it by making a scene. He looked at his son and decided not to be a story the boy would have to live down after he died. These are small arithmetic. They keep a city from bleeding to death not by tourniquet but by teaching the blood to go where it is wanted.

We stayed until dusk and we left before supper because people must be allowed to eat their own bread without queens at their table explaining to them how bread is made. On the way back to the road Sera beat a path through the nettles with the flat of her hand so that the next girl barefooted would not curse in her mother’s hearing. The Anchoress untied the bull from a thought it had about the fence and told it a story about patience that did not use the word. The Mothers wrote three refusals and one acceptance and three Noes and one laugh, which is a very good day for a ledger. Tyne flicked her string and set the little bell on the boy’s belt to hum in approval rather than in complaint, which is something we should do more often and rarely remember to.

Hadran walked beside me again and would have said something if I had invited him to participate in my thinking. I did not. I held my thinking to my chest like a baby with a toothache and let it gum my collarbone because there are pains you must let be in order to know where the fever will go. He understood and did not pester my silence. That is love too.

When the city came up to meet us, twilight had learned to wear violet in a way that makes every stone more honest about its age. The bell did not ring. The cats did not come to the gate. The High Recorder stood on the steps with his pen like a banner and did not look foolish. The Lace had made their letter multiply on the walls of the place where old proclamations go to die, and the letters did not take. The wall had been taught to reject those vowels. It had been seasoned with hands that cleared it with bread and not with knives. When I stepped under the arch the rope under the world hummed once and fell quiet and I understood something I had not been ready to admit to myself.

We had cut something after all. Not the rope. Not the boys. Not the bell. We had cut a thread that runs between a certain kind of man and a certain kind of heroism, the thread that lets him believe virtue is only ever installed from the outside and never wrestled with from inside a hand. We had tied something too. We had tied men to the habit of being watched by their own mouths. We had tied women to the permission to stop tidying up after miracles and to sit down and have their tea while the miracle learned to sweep.

In my room the bread knife lay on the Book like a polite threat. I lifted it and weighed it and set it down again without kissing either of them because I would not make prayer of tools that have asked for nothing but use. The cats at last came and put their bodies against my shins and made a sound like acceptance. Sera leaned in the doorway and looked at my hands and did not ask if I planned to cut anyone I loved tomorrow. Tyne sat on the floor and tied a knot in air and rolled it across the boards like a child’s toy. The Anchoress stood by the window and reminded the night that it belonged to no one and it would be lent to those who could be kind to it.

“We will be counted,” I said, not to anyone particular, and the city, which loves to eavesdrop on its own queen, wrote the sentence down somewhere I will never see and filed it under This Is How We Did It When We Could Not Afford War. The bell slept. The rope slept. The men did not sleep. The women did, at last, for a little while, and dreamt not of knives but of weight held correctly, the kind that makes a back straight without breaking it. And I, who had been told by a man I loved to kill him if it would save a city and had found a thousand other ways to make that threat honest without using it, slept and did not dream of him, which is a mercy I did not deserve and cannot explain.
