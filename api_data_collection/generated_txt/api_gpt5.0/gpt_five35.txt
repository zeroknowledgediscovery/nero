They poured over the railings and the gutters like water with teeth, their hands small and clever and endlessly patient. The city had learned to leave its fruit in cages. It had learned to sleep in hammocks with its boots tucked beneath its back. This was not enough. They came anyway, on lamplit cables and along the curbs, clattering bottlecaps and charms with the rhythm of rain. In the early morning, they were quieter, only watching with the glittering interest of children in a museum. By dusk, it was the old world again: sirens and glass, shouts, a thrown apple, a hundred hundred fingers closing.

“Don’t look them in the eye,” someone hissed near her wrist, and the habit already lived inside her muscles, though she couldn’t recall who had taught it. She turned her face with care toward the river, toward the bend where the water had slowed to a thoughtful crawl and eddied against a forest of pilings wearing necklaces of old algae. The monkey on the bollard cocked its head, then went back to studying her bag with its pinkish eyelids half-lowered, like a banker.

It was a green bag, canvas gone grey through loving and weather and a single terrible night. She lifted it and the strap squeaked against her shoulder. A single small thing inside it had weight enough to keep her upright. The thing was not named, not by her, though others had named it and claimed it and whispered over it. She refused the name. She refused a great many things.

“Eveline,” the hiss again, bone-dry and resentful as a cricket. “We don’t have all day.”

She turned her face again and smiled across the slant of light at the woman in the red scarf. The woman had a mouth like a hatchet and hands that had learned to cradle babies and bottles with the same sure kindness. They called her Mira because she mirrored nothing. She had five rings in her right ear and a map of scars along her forearms, pale lattices where macaques had tried to take what wasn’t theirs.

“Coming,” Eveline said, and began to move, down the staircase of stone, over the ropes and wires stretched between poles, across to the tanks that caught rain and traded it back to the quarter in brown bottles. The monkeys parted for her the way water parts around a post. This was not normal. She knew that. She had known it the way one knows a stone in the shoe and refuses to sit down to remove it.

Mira watched the parting and spat and made the sign of the fig behind her back. “Uncanny,” she said. “Bad luck to them, not to us.”

“I’m ordinary,” Eveline said, with a woman’s grace at lying to the people she loved. She tipped her chin at the little ones clinging to the lamppost and flashed the smooth teeth of someone harmless. They fluffed and hissed. Some of the old ones, the ones with hands like a grandmother’s, peered at her and muttered their soft syllables: krr-krr, bup-bup, as if to lay a claim and then think better of it.

Mira picked up baskets. She paid with pasteboard coins and with cigarettes. They moved from stall to stall. There were pumpkins the size of a grown man’s head, and slender green beans braided into ropes and the last tomatoes in faded summer dresses. Everywhere there were painted eyes, stickers on bins and crates and walls. The eyes were a prayer. The monkeys loved to peel them off.

“So,” Mira said. “Doctor Sen sent word through Carver. We got a line on the old place.”

Eveline did not stop moving, though it felt like she had, halfway between the tins of lamp oil and the bolt of soft denim Grandpa Pike would always tear one-handed just to test its quality. She was not there anymore, and he was not alive. She knew this. She also did not know it. “What place,” she said, with the careful indifference of someone expecting a specific answer and willing the universe to comply.

“The hill,” Mira said, impatient. “Where your people kept their pens. Where they made their ink and their rules. Calvert House. There’s a party moving that way from the river towns by the old viaduct, and if we don’t beat them—”

“Calvert House isn’t there,” Eveline said. “It burned.” She could taste it when she said the word. The oils. Shellac and seed. The bitter sugar of ink boiling.

Mira bent close. “Houses don’t burn like that,” she said. “We all saw. It fell and it didn’t. The walls sagged like cloth and then snapped back like they remembered being stone, like some child’s trick. You know what does that.”

“Age,” Eveline said softly. “And hatred.”

Mira shook her head. “No. Binding. Old binding.” She put her hand, ungloved, on Eveline’s knuckles and squeezed until it was either comfort or a challenge. “We’ll go tonight. Doctor Sen says the tide will be right. He says the colobus are on the far side where the gardens are, and the macaques won’t cross that water after dark if they can help it. You’re coming.”

“I thought you had no use for doctors,” Eveline said.

“I have less use for queens,” Mira said. “And less use for waiting to die.”

They looked at each other in the slant of late afternoon, two women with bad hair and stubborn eyes. The monkeys noticed nothing, or noticed and filed it in that complicated ledger of theirs. A young one dived into the basket and came out with a potato, triumphant. Mira snatched it back and it bared its little knives and made the sound that meant I would bite your face if I could. Then it fled up a drainpipe, tail a brown exclamation.

“Fine,” Eveline said, because it had already happened in her body anyway: the remembering of the slope of the road to the house, the odd way the gate swung, the precise pitch of the hinge that said a man had once loved it enough to oil it. The way the library smelled when there were three blanket-damp children on the hearth and a pot of ink left open with a cloth over it to keep the monkeys from stealing the nibs right out of the jar. “Fine. I’ll go. For the joke of it.”

“It’s not a joke,” Mira began.

“I know,” Eveline said, and smiled. “That’s why it will be good.”

On their way out of the market, a baboon with the carved face of a god and a tail like a question mark stared at Eveline as if he could see through her. There were such monkeys. The uncles and unbrothers, the ones who had watched fires from the tops of statues and learned that nothing was sacred except food. He bared his gums and grinned. She grinned back, all human teeth, all wrong. It startled him enough to take one small step backward, which made the capuchins at his flank snicker and side-eye, never kind.

Mira pulled Eveline through the last press of bodies and into the alley where the brick still wore the naming of a vanished bakery: SUGAR & SON. The letters were flaking and coated with soot. The monkeys liked to sit on the S because it was the easiest to hold with your heels.

“Doctor Sen,” Mira said, as if he had been behind the next door all along, but he wasn’t. The thin door let out into the long warehouse where people had once packed books with crinkly brown paper, and now they packed jars of pickled carrots and strings of beans that tasted like winter. He was at a table, writing with a stub of pencil in a ledger that had survived, by endurance or by a mischief of gods.

He did not look up at them right away, which was how the old ones had always handled her. As if making her wait would confirm to her that she was ordinary, that her name was the same size of everyone else’s. But then he did look up, and when his eyes found hers something like lightning went through his face.

“Miss Calvert,” he said, and stood, forgetting the pencil which rolled, but did not fall. His throat worked. He was not a graceful man. The monkeys had taken his left ear once while he slept, which had made him more careful, which had saved his life many times since. “I wasn’t sure.”

“Of what,” Eveline said, cheerfully enough.

“That you would agree,” he said, and then more softly: “That you were here at all.”

“I’m very present,” she said, in the tone that suggested both agreement and mockery. Present. A word used in schools and parlors. A word they had pinned on her with gold when she was twelve and could recite, from memory, the five formulations of ink her great-grandfather had used to sign a war and un-sign it.

He motioned for her to sit. She did and felt nothing of the chair. She would not allow it to be odd. “We think the vault is intact,” he said. “Not the downstairs vault where the copper plates were kept, those would have gone when the kitchen went, but the under-under. The Hall.” He swallowed. “The one they tell about in the apprentice songs. The one with the contracts.”

Mira was watching the monkeys along the rafters instead of them, but the word changed the shape of her shoulders. Contracts. Magic of the cheap and the dear. Words stuck to paper with a resin made of three resins and a thing that wasn’t resin at all. The monkeys had no contracts. They had seasonal truces, they had a sense of fairness that ran like a scar along the knuckles of the world, they had long memories and a low, deep humor. They had none of the ways men had forced their lies to sit down and make children.

“You want the Calamus,” Eveline said. At last. It cost something to say it.

“I want it protected,” Doctor Sen said, quick. “I want, at least, for the people who know what it can do to outnumber the people who will pretend they don’t.” He opened the ledger as if out of nervous habit, then closed it, and looked at her hand. “I also want to apologize,” he said abruptly, and everything in the warehouse got quieter.

Mira half-turned. “For what.”

An apple thumped to the floor somewhere far back. Someone hushed someone else with a long breath. Doctor Sen looked down at his hands. He had a nick along the base of his thumb that never healed and never got truly infected, because the world had decided to give him that mercy in exchange for all the others it would withhold.

“For telling them,” he said to Eveline. “For telling the men in the clean coats that you knew where it was. I told them you remembered even when you didn’t. I told them you would lead them to it. I thought I could control it. I thought the monkeys would keep them busy long enough to get you away.” He looked up. “I was wrong. I have been wrong. I didn’t know, then, what you were.”

Eveline stared at him out of a face that had always been told its bones were good. Her mouth tasted of metal and sleep. “And what is that,” she said, pleasantly.

“A lantern,” he said. “And a door.”

Mira had stopped pretending not to listen. “Stop there, poet,” she said. “What are you telling us? Say it like we can’t read.”

He exhaled. He was older than anyone in the room but had the body of a schoolboy punished to carry water. “Calamus recognizes its own,” he said. “It isn't held, or passed. It bonds. The Calverts always said blood, but what they meant was belonging. It’s why it couldn’t be pried out of the hand of the last Master Writer even when his hand was not—”

“You think I know where it is,” Eveline said, to make a joke of it, but the joke had no legs, it sat still and sulked.

“I think it wants you to know,” Doctor Sen said. “I think it has been wanting for a while.”

It moved in her then, a cold at the base of the spine that was the memory of swimming in April, before anyone else dared. It moved and settled like a coin finding the bottom of a fountain, like a thing that had been falling and was tired of falling.

“The house is nothing,” she said, lightly. “This is nothing. A party trick. The monkeys will watch us and call the others, and at the gate they will whisper into the columns the names of the dead to frighten us and we will laugh and bow and give them chickpeas, because we are very wise.”

“Eveline,” Mira said. She had never liked to use her name. She preferred nicknames. Girl. Cat. Heiress. “You don’t have to do this.”

“Yes,” Eveline said brightly. “I do. Because we are out of tires to burn for smoke, and because the monkeys have learned we dress our windows with eyes and they laugh at them now, and because the river towns are clever and cruel and I would rather die than let them sign anything with the wrong pen.” She stood, and the chair scraped politely, as if there were that much friction to be had. “Tonight, then. At the tide.”

They started at dusk. You don’t start a thing like that and expect it’s the beginning. You pretend you have always been on the road. They took the narrow lanes where the cobbles had shifted under the weight of a century’s wheeled plunder, they took the corridors the monkeys made of clotheslines and unlikely rafter-walks, they took the gutter that had once carried the brine from the fishrooms of a cheap restaurant and now carried nothing but cigarette ends and the coins people threw to hear the old sound. The monkeys watched. Some followed, like drumbeats heading upriver to a war.

Mira had a bat wrapped in cloth. She had tied bells to the cloth so she would hear her own hand if it was ever too late. Doctor Sen pulled a little cart on one wheel with rope he had braided out of something that used to be a woman’s dress. There were five others, all of them unremarkable except that they had lived through a small apocalypse and learned how to tie knots with their toes. They passed the leaning statue of the municipal poet who had once described, in feline terms, the joy of municipal gaslight. The monkeys had given him a necklace and eyebrows and then eaten the flowers at his feet.

Eveline kept the bag close. The thing inside it was quiet as a bone.

At the old street where the sycamores had grown through the railings and lifted them like jewelry to their calves, a troop of macaques thicker than hair moved in a brown ribbon across the road and paused, coiling, to watch. Mira tightened her grip. Doctor Sen did something with his mouth that was both prayer and curse. Eveline looked at them and her heart turned a little in its dish with joy. It was madness, but it was also true: she loved them. They had saved the world, in a way. They had torn down the fevers and the lies and the ringing machines and said: what if everything went back to teeth.

A female with a scar like a lightning bolt up her thigh padded forward, regarded Eveline, then picked up a piece of broken glass and offered it with both hands, solemn. Eveline took it, carefully, and bowed. The female sat back on her haunches and urinated with the leisurely contempt of a queen. Then, satisfied, she led her people away along the ridge of the old iron fence, their tails writing letters in the dark.

“You do that on purpose,” Mira said after a few paces. “Courting them.”

“I am extremely charming,” Eveline said.

“You are something they don’t understand,” Doctor Sen said. “It makes them behave as if they are polite.”

They reached the hill line as the last of the light seeped into a purple that was almost bruise and almost wine. The house was there. And it was not. The bones of it were right enough: the long facade of windows like a batter of teeth, the portico with its columns that had always looked like pastry and now looked like something day-old and edible, the roofline like a chessboard knocked askew. But the surface, that was not right. It breathed. It contracted like a muscle and then relaxed as if tired and then pulled again, remembering itself. You could smell ink because it had been spilled through the generations into the floorboards, into the walls, into the pinched, reluctant pores of the stone itself. You could smell smoke because once something had turned to fire and then had refused.

“So,” Mira said. “Your family had a pet house.”

“My family had a problem,” Eveline said, and it cost her to say family. Each syllable was a well. “The house had a rule. You must write to enter. You must write to leave. It was a long joke. It is not funny anymore.”

Doctor Sen untied the rope from his cart, thinking with his hands. “We can go around,” he said. “There’s a low place at the north wall where the cattle used to be driven through at night.”

“No,” Eveline said, and stepped forward, because it was she who carried the key and she who would find it heavy enough to lay down.

At the door, she set down the bag. The handle made the sound of a coin in a tin, which meant that no amount of cloth would disguise the density of the thing inside it. She reached for the knob. It was round and old. From the right houses, grams of brass were treated like sons. She could see the swirl of the casting still, that fingerprint of molten metal spun into shape. She reached, and her hand went through it as if it were smoke.

She stopped. No one breathed.

She looked down at her own wrist. The light went through it as through a bottle of water held to the sun. Not all the way. Enough. The skin was there and not. The bone was there the way a memory is there when you exit a theater and forget yourself, briefly.

Mira said a word that could be a prayer and a curse, because in this new world all the words had learned to be both, and reached out as if to hold her by the elbow. Her hand closed on air. It was clumsy, and silly, how they both pretended it was a trick. How they both laughed, a little, with the humor of those standing on newly thin ice under a full moon. Doctor Sen closed his eyes like a man who understood something he wished he did not.

“I didn’t,” Eveline began, and then stopped. She had been very proud, once, of where she stopped and where she did not. The world had enjoyed making both into obligations.

“You didn’t eat enough,” Mira said, too loud. “You’re weak. You’re— it’s the stories. They get into the walls. We have been living in rotten air. Stop it. Stop it with your face.”

Eveline lifted her hand again, slowly now, and watched her own knuckles cross the threshold of the brass and pass through with the quiet of smoke between slats. Behind her, the monkeys had gathered in a ring of benches they had formed from their own bodies. They hooted, softly, like the old men at the corner when anyone did something that reminded them of love.

“Doctor,” Eveline said, not turning, because the air beyond the door suddenly had a taste. It was the taste of paper. Above paper. Of salt that had been dried with paper and then scraped off into a jar. “Doctor, do you see this, or am I mad.”

“I see,” he said, and his voice had respect in it now, the way a man will speak at a grave. “I suspected, after the fire. After the men went in and came out raving that they had heard their own mothers telling them to wash their hands. After no one would meet your eye who had once hated you. I suspected. I did not say. I waited. I am sorry.”

“What,” Mira demanded, flung at them both. “What. Say it. I am not going to stand here while you both pretend to be saints.”

“I died,” Eveline said, and the words sat in her mouth, surprised to be so heavy and correct. “I died the night of the fire, and then I did not go. I waited. I have been waiting. For this, I suppose.”

Mira shook her head, a denial too big for her neck. “No. You came to my door. You ate my peaches. You cried when the old man under the bridge sang that song about the yellow dog.”

“I did,” Eveline said. “And I didn’t.” She looked straight into Mira’s face and it was like looking into a lake where you once drowned. “There are rules,” she said. “They’re not written down. Not by us. The house took my name when it burned. Or the pen did. It is the same thing, sometimes.” Her left hand touched the bag as if the bag could be comforted. “It kept me. Or I kept it. Or both. And no one can see me, not fully, unless I let them, or unless they knew me before. That’s why the monkeys—”

“They always see a little. Or they see too much,” Doctor Sen said softly. “We are the ones constrained.”

“The thing inside the bag,” Mira said, and now her voice was iron. “Take it out.”

Eveline swallowed. People have rituals for opening a thing that matters. We do them once and then pretend we always did. She set the bag on the stone, loosened the two buckles that had been worn thin at the holes, and slid her hand into the cloth. Her fingers passed through the lining. The lining resisted. There was a feeling of being held, and of holding. The way a child and a rope hold one another. Then her hand closed on wood.

Not wood. The memory of wood. It was smooth and old and weightless like a bone that had weathered on a beach for a thousand years. There were ridges. Not decoration. Function. Even in the dark of the bag, it shone.

She drew the pen into the light and everything around them became obedient. It does not matter if you believe this. It was true. The monkeys went still, their tails arched like commas written by an anxious schoolteacher. The house stopped its muscle-breath. Doctor Sen took a step back and put his hand to his chest, as if he had remembered suddenly where his heart was and had to hold it there. Mira took the bell-wrapped bat and laid it down very carefully as one lays down a baby when one is done with an impossible walk.

It was not a pen in the modern sense. It was not a fountain pen with a gold nib, nor a ballpoint with a toothy pearl cap. It was a reed. Calamus. Carved from the hardened stalk of a marsh plant that had spent a lifetime drinking mud and sunlight and had then died in a way that allowed it to become this. The end was cut obliquely and then cut again into a split that made the nib. It would hold ink like a mouth holds a promise. The shaft was wrapped at one end with rusted wire and hair. Hair. It might have been Eveline’s great-grandmother’s hair. The old ones had used such things. They were practical and they were savage; it is one of the same.

The Calamus did not glint, because it did not need to. Light did not cling to it; it went around it like water around a familiar stone.

Mira exhaled. “Ugly,” she said, as if this insult would protect her.

Eveline laughed, and it sounded like a broken glass finding its footing. “Yes,” she said. “Like me.”

“Write,” Doctor Sen said. “While it listens. While the house remembers you.”

“What shall I write,” Eveline said, and once she would have had a dozen jokes. Now she had one. “My name.”

“No,” Mira said sharply. “They will take it again. They will hide you for real.”

“Not if it is written right,” Doctor Sen said, but he was a coward with his voice. He had not lost enough to say it like a man who deserved to say it.

Eveline lifted the pen. There was no ink. There was ink. The world is made of ink and we pretend otherwise. The tips of leaves. The small black eyes of fish. The way night gets into your hair if you sleep too near a window you shouldn’t. She raised it and brought it down and drew on the stone of the door a single line, and then another, and then a curve that made a sound in the air as if a lute string had been plucked inside a bottle.

The letters were not letters. They were the idea of a name. They were the first time a child looks at his own hand and realizes it is a tool, and the second time, when he realizes it is also a weapon. She wrote, and the house took a breath as if about to speak.

Behind them, down the hill, someone shouted. It was not a monkey. Words like: Hey. There. Get them. It was a man, several men, with the boldness of people who had no idea what it meant to be polite to a house. The river towns. They came in twos and tens, and they carried things that used to be useful — bolt cutters, a leaf blower, a flag.

Mira picked up her bat and became very calm. Doctor Sen’s hand hovered near his pocket, where he kept, for no reason anyone thought logical, a small transparent case of beetles pinned with old pins. He was a scientist; he kept dangerous delicate things that someone else had killed. The monkeys were climbing in the trees, in the gutters, on the backs of the statues. There was a chittering that meant excitement and then another that meant nervous courage and then another that meant an old promise being remembered whether you want it or not.

Eveline finished the last curl. The Calamus lay against her fingers as if it had been carved by her own hand in another life. She could do anything now. She could write a door into the side of a mountain. She could write a treaty with the sea. She could write her name on the inside of the moon and it would have to carry it like a scar.

She turned. The men were at the bottom of the stairs. They were boys she had known at dances when the old world had one more breath in it, and they were the fathers of those boys, thick-shouldered, hungry. One of them saw her and did not see her and took off his hat politely, as if the glass had reflected some memory of a lady. Another looked at Mira and did a thing with his mouth that had always been called a smile by bad men.

“This house is ours by declaration of the River Safety Council,” the one with the flag called, in a voice that had been trained to speak over fish markets. “We come to claim any valuables and to assess the premises for salvage and to offer fair exchange.” He smiled then, and the smile made even his friends look at the ground. “We see you have writing tools.”

“We have nothing,” Mira said. “We have air.”

“You have air and you are breathing it,” the man said. “That is illegal in this zone without permits.”

The monkeys laughed. They always laughed when humans made jokes about legality. They had never been to that school. They had never watched a man in a robe borrow a pen and give it back with a drop of blood on the nib.

“Eveline,” Doctor Sen said, and his voice had the exact pitch of a climber speaking to the person who has the rope. “Open the door.”

She stood before the name she had written that was not her name, and she lifted the Calamus, and the house sighed and unlocked, and the world she had been skirting all this time opened to her like a book.

Inside the air was cool and dry as the first pages of an atlas. The monkeys did not cross the threshold. The men on the stairs hesitated, because hesitation is contagious. Mira passed in beside Eveline, a deeper shadow inside a shadow. Doctor Sen followed and, before he entered, he turned and bowed to the men as if at the end of a lecture. “Gentlemen,” he said, and shut the door in their faces with a grace that had once been taught to anyone who could sit still for ten minutes on a Sunday afternoon.

The hall smelled of shellac and pepper. It smelled of dust that had decided to last forever. Eveline lifted the pen and the name on the door gleamed like a wet thing, for a moment, and then went dull as any chalk.

“You did it,” Mira said. She was shaking. “You. Did that.”

“I remembered,” Eveline said. She had not expected the tears; a ridiculous flaw. “It isn’t the same.”

“It never is,” Doctor Sen said, and struck a match to a candle that had been waiting, unburned, on a marble shelf as if the house had set it out for exactly this moment and then, embarrassed, almost hidden it.

They went forward. The house liked the pen. You could feel it the way you feel an animal not bite you. It gave them light that wasn’t there. It gave them floorboards that did not creak. It gave them, along one wall, the portraits of people who had once been politely terrible and were now only beautiful and sad, and one of them — a woman with a bright hard mouth and wrists like pencils — turned her painted head as they passed and said, with all the boredom of the dead, "Finally."

“Hello, Great-Aunt,” Eveline said, to be polite.

“She dead,” Mira murmured, shocked less by the talking than by Eveline’s etiquette.

“Yes,” the portrait said, and yawned, the yawn painted and real. “We all are. Don’t act surprised. Get on with it.”

“Get on with what,” Doctor Sen said, because he parried sarcasm with curiosity like a man who has learned it is the only reliable armor.

“Writing,” said the painted woman. “You don’t think the monkeys are the problem, do you? They’re only enthusiastic. The problem is that you stopped writing rules that mattered. You started writing menus and apologies. We can’t help you with that, because we already did it, and see where it got us.”

Eveline tightened her grip on the Calamus. “Where is the Hall,” she asked, and the house did not make them guess. It tilted a scent into the air — walnut, iron — and opened a stretch of the wall that had always been there, had never been there, with a sigh like a drawer being pulled, like the satisfying sound of a paper torn in half exactly along the fold.

Down they went, the door closing behind them politely, like a butler with secrets. The stairs were shallow, because the old ones knew that you will always climb the stairs of a library to the end if you are not made to labor. Eveline’s hand on the banister was a shadow of a hand and it did not matter. The Calamus rested against her shoulder like a peevish animal that had finally been taken to the place it wanted to go.

At the bottom there was a room with a table that was not a table. It was less the wood than the idea of a surface flat enough and patient enough to accept ink and not smear it. The walls were covered in frames, each holding a sheet, and the sheets were not paper. They were thin bone. Elephant. Whale. Carefully carved and sanded, written upon with the neat, stern handwriting of people who believed they could make deals with the future.

Mira stopped. Doctor Sen reached for the nearest and then drew his hand back because he was not a thief. Eveline stepped to the table and laid the Calamus upon it and it made the sound of a thing returning to a shelf where it had always belonged. Everything tilted, slightly, toward her.

“Eveline,” Mira whispered. “They’ll break the door. They’ll come.”

“I know,” Eveline said. The knowledge was calm in her blood. They would. Men loved breaking more than monkeys did. They would break the door and they would bring torches and water and statutes and appetites. “I will write before they do.”

“What,” Doctor Sen began, and then stopped, because he had made a habit of trusting women when the pen was in their hand. It had saved his life and the lives of others, repeatedly.

“I will write a rule,” Eveline said. “Not a law, they can be unmade with teeth. A rule.” She smiled, a small thing, and felt the house smile in reply. “Call,” she said to the walls. “Call them.”

The portraits came. The house shook them from its wrists like bracelets. Great-Aunt with her neat mouth, a child with ink-stained fingers who had died, at seven, of a fever no one had thought to name because they were talking too loudly about tariffs, a tall man whose ring had cut the cheek of a man he slapped, and who had cried later in his bath and confessed to no one. They gathered around the table. They were not helpful. They were witnesses.

Eveline dipped the Calamus into nothing. It found what it needed. She brought it up and began to write. The first stroke made the air hum. The rise of it made the monkeys above them freeze again, above ground, and press their hands to their chests, imitating. It made the men pounding on the door forget why they were afraid and remember only that they were.

“I write,” she said, because the old words mattered. “That anyone who enters this place with the intent to take shall leave with hands full of ash, always. I write that the monkeys shall not be bound, because they do not care to be. I write that they shall see and remember, because they are better at remembering than we are. I write that any man who comes here shall be brought to the table and made to speak his true name. I write that the pen will pass through the hand of any liar and burn him a little, as if with nettles, just enough.”

Mira was crying silently now, the way women cry when they are thinking about their own names. Doctor Sen had become once again a scientist and was counting his breaths to time his heart.

“And finally,” Eveline said, and the reed shook in her hand, “I write that the ghosts within shall be given voices when the work is called for. Not only mine. All of them. The house is not a vault. It is a chorus. We have waited. We will not be quiet.”

She lifted the nib. The lines she had made glistened and then they did not. Somewhere above, someone screamed that the door had disappeared. Somewhere else, nearer, a monkey giggled at a joke only monkeys tell.

The Calamus lay on the table and Evelyn laid her palm beside it, and for the first time since she had died she felt wood. It was brief, and it was shattering, and it was enough.

“Again,” the portrait of the Great-Aunt said dryly. “Only better.”

“Thank you,” Eveline said, and turned to the stairs, and to the door, and to a hundred hundred small faces pressed against the windows like a bouquet of questions, and to the men with flags, and to all the ink that had boiled into the walls and waited a decade for a hand it could trust.

She was a ghost. She had been rich. She had been spoiled past usefulness and then carved into use. The world was monkeys and laughter and knives and brown biscotti and rain and a house that breathed. She did not know, not yet, what the pen would ask in exchange for saving the ruined piece of mankind selected by luck and proximity. She did not know if the monkeys would consent to any of it, except to be amused.

She went up. The Calamus was light in her hand and not light at all. In the little shadow at the edge of the landing, a colobus with a nun’s headdress of white hair looked at her and then at the pen and then put both hands over its eyes, giggling, like a child who wants to show it understands a solemn thing by taking it into play.

Eveline reached the door in time to hear the river men argue about whether to set the place on fire and whether fire would only make it wet. She stood there and waited until their breath steadied. Then she lifted the pen and wrote on the air between them and the house a door made of nothing, and it opened, and it showed them themselves when they were small and in love with something no one else could see.

They stumbled, and those who were good enough cried, and those who were not good enough laughed too hard. And the monkeys above, the monkeys all around, chattered to each other in that language none of us will ever learn, saying, perhaps: remember this. It will not happen again. Or saying nothing at all, because they knew that we were already telling stories with whatever was in our hands, and what we had now was a reed and a ghost and the old, dishonest weight of a name.They did not run at the first magic, which told Eveline what kind of hunger lived in them. The door of nothing stood between the house and the men like a window into a kinder afternoon, and for a breath the flag-bearer’s mouth remembered the shape of a kiss given to a girl who had later married a butcher, and the boy with the bolt cutters remembered his father’s hands not yet ruined by rope and cold, and the one with the leaf blower remembered picking up an exhausted swallow from a sidewalk and believing he had saved it. Then the trick let go of them as anything gentle will, because it is not that kind of weapon, and the men did what men do around wonder: they tried to own it. The tallest pushed forward and jammed his boot against the threshold as if force could teach him what politeness wouldn’t. His fingers groped for the latch. He came away with ash as if the house had been full of hearths and he had thrust his hands into all of them at once. He stared stupidly, not quite understanding that the rule had found him and would not tire, and then he swore and wiped his palms on the flag, as if there were some disinfectant in the dye.

“Lovely,” Mira said in the cool, pleasant tone she reserved for men bleeding from clear, easily treatable wounds. “You’ve learned a new trick. Now learn to go around.” She stood with her bat balanced behind her shoulder, the bells muted with one calloused thumb, and looked like the kind of small saint whose miracles were canceling debts and breaking fingers.

Eveline kept the pen lifted just enough that it cast a thought of a shadow over the crack between door and sill. She did not write. She let the absence of ink remind everyone how recently the world had been held together by the idea that handwriting mattered. The flag-bearer forced his face into authority, which is an odd muscle near the cheeks that always looks like constipation if the owner is not careful. “I’m required,” he said, painfully formal, “to advise you that this entrance is under claim per the River Safety—”

“Speak your name,” Eveline said gently, and the air around her shifted to accept the instruction as if it were a cup finding its saucer. It wasn’t a command. It was something kinder and thus much harder to ignore.

He blinked. He had a square, serviceable face that had done carpentry before it did speeches. “I’m called—” he began, and then his mouth betrayed him the way mouths do when the world’s tired of your mask. “Solomon Oates,” he said, and winced, which meant he had not introduced himself as such for a very long time.

“Solly,” someone behind him murmured, gleefully cruel, and Mr. Oates flushed in a way that would have been a laugh, once, between boys who had not yet learned to make every softness into a weapon.

“Solomon,” Eveline said, and inclined her head because names deserve respect even when they are dragged out of a throat. “You may enter if you can tell me what it is you came to take.”

He stared at her, then at Mira, then at Doctor Sen visible over her shoulder like a sketch someone had forgotten to finish, and then beyond, where the hall breathed a little in the way of old places when they are trying not to. To his credit, he did not say orphans or decency or safety. He said, “Ink,” and then, seeing that a ghost and a woman with a bat and a man without an ear were not enough audience for such honesty, he added, stubborn, “And food. And warm stone in the winter. And a wall where the monkeys won’t come over it like water.”

“The monkeys come over everything like water,” Mira said. “That’s their gift. They’re not your problem.”

“They take,” he said, with the narrow righteousness of a man who has been stolen from by so many hands that he has chosen the most obvious as a target. “They laugh. They don’t carry what we carry.”

“They carry a world on each shoulder that we don’t see,” Doctor Sen said, quietly and, for once, without apology. “Just because you don’t recognize a burden doesn’t make your own heavier.”

Solomon Oates’ hands twitched, remembering the ash. He looked at the flag he had stained and looked ashamed, then angry at having been made to feel ashamed, then sad because it wasn’t anyone’s fault that he couldn’t afford to feel anything except anger. “If I’m kept out,” he said, not to Eveline but to the fragile dignity that remained to him, “I won’t forget. I’m no thief. I’m not here to break and run.”

“Then speak what you’ll leave,” Eveline said, and the pen in her hand whistled a little like a reed when the wind is right through a culvert. “Because all bargains worth anything include the part about what you’ll give up.”

Around them, the monkeys leaned forward, doubling paws under chins the way old ladies do when they set their elbows on sills to listen to gossip. A colobus with a mane like a priest of some saltwater church sat on the gatepost and stared without blinking. There was respect there. Or annoyance repeated so often it had turned into a sort of reverence.

Solomon swallowed. It was a hard thing being told to show your pockets when you’d taught yourself to pass among men with your fists always politely open. “I’ll leave the claim,” he said after a few heartbeats and the shuffle of his friends’ boots, many small decisions being made in a language of scuffs and avoided eyes. “I’ll say to my people that the house is a bad place, ancient, a trap. I’ll tell them to keep to the river, to the mud. I’ll give back the door we took from the east end. And I won’t come in with cutters and grins.” He stared at Eveline with a steady loathing that had something like awe tucked into one corner of it. “But I won’t feed you. And if you starve I won’t write your names on any wall.”

“Fair,” Mira said. “We weren’t asking you to bring cake.”

Eveline wrote a small, nearly invisible mark on the air between them with a flick that used to open dances. “Agreed,” she said. “You’re welcome to water drawn with clean hands from the south cistern when you’ve been courteous. You’ll leave with what you brought when you enter with empty hands. If you lie, the door will make you honest.” She glanced at his palms, remembering the ash. “It already has a taste for it.”

He flinched again and then gathered up the shredded dignity. “We’re not beggars,” he snarled. “We’ll take from the river. We always have.”

“Then you’ll die when it floods,” Doctor Sen said, not unkindly. “Or you’ll live because something with black hands pulls you out of a tree and leaves your baby on a porch where we feed it. Either way, you’ll come around again and declare yourselves sovereign, and we’ll put that paper under a jar and look at it when we are bored, and the world will be flat as an old promise.” He smiled with terrible softness. “Or we can start over. Or we can die differently.”

“You talk like books,” Solomon spat, but the spitting didn’t reach his feet. He looked at the monkeys, who were now making notes on their thighs with their fingers the way they always did when people lied. “Keep your house,” he said. “Keep your tricks. We won’t forget.” He turned on his heel and went down the steps. The others went with him, not because they had decided anything, but because he was a direction and the day was growing thin.

When they had gone far enough that the air opened a little and the evening city could remember itself, the macaques burst into laughter that was honest and vile. They loved a humiliating exit. The colobus didn’t laugh. She turned her head and made a small movement that in their grammar meant: that didn’t solve anything, but it was handsome. She watched Eveline’s hand with the pen in it, and something like unease flickered across her pale face. Then, with a hop like a prayer flag shaking, she vanished into leaves that had no right to be green and were.

“They’ll be back,” Mira said, when the last of the flag fabric was gone around a corner. “And they won’t come as men. They’ll come as smoke and promises and wires and laws. The monkeys will be kinder.”

“They always are,” Doctor Sen murmured, and he sounded tired as a wall.

Eveline lowered the pen, feeling already the slow slide in her bones, cold dropping like a coin in a well. The hand she had placed on the table below did not feel like a hand anymore. It felt like a memory of a hand, sung back to her by a choir that had lost its altos. She did not remark on it. She would not, until it had taken her again fully, because naming isn’t always empowerment. Often it is invitation.

“Inside,” she said, and when Mira hesitated, she reached—foolish, habitual—toward her with the empty hand. Mira was braced for the loss and still, when her fingers closed on nothing, she made a sound that was hunting knife and wedding vow at once. Then she settled and put two fingers through Eveline’s forearm as if to lace them behind a railing, and together they turned back into the house.

The hall offered them light and a hush like breath after a punch. The portraits had resumed their stares with varying degrees of theatricality. Two of the smaller ones—children in velvet, dead of summers—had turned their chairs halfway to be able to eavesdrop properly. Great-Aunt had managed to rotate her entire canvas so that she now hung at a charming, defiant angle as if the painter had drunk three sherries and decided to risk the wrath of the matriarchs.

“Did you mean it,” she said, before they were fully under the portico, spoken with the boredom of the glamorous after too much party. “About letting anyone in with clean hands. Do you know what men will do with a clause like that.”

“Yes,” Eveline said. “They’ll wash.” Her smile was real this time and ugly, and Great-Aunt’s hard mouth softened the smallest amount. They had not understood one another in life, which is not the same as having nothing to say to each other after death.

They did not descend again at once. The house had already begun to test the new rule like a dog offered a clock that smelled like a bone. Eveline felt the pulse of it along the floorboards, the way basements breathe when the rain shifts under streets. In a far room a latch unlatched and latched again. A draft went down and then up, offended by its own ingratitude. The monkeys on the roof argued in grumbles that made plaster dust drift down in soft sighs, like the house shedding old skin. It would have been pleasant to sit and listen with a slice of bread in hand and someone’s foot against yours under the table, but those kinds of pleasures were for days when the verbs were all in the present tense.

In the kitchen that wasn’t a kitchen, because all the iron had warped into a sculpture of itself and the stove door had fused to the bricks as if embarrassed to have ever opened, Mira knelt and pressed her palm flat on the hearth. She closed her eyes and felt for something newly simple in a world that had become complicated precisely anywhere it used to be straightforward. “You wrote yourself,” she said without opening her eyes. “Into the world. Again. And in doing so you wrote yourself away. Again.”

“Perhaps,” Eveline said. “The equation might be kind, this time. Or it might be that there’s no arithmetic at all and I only happen to resemble a column in some book that always balances.”

“You’re not numbers,” Mira said, and looked up with something in her face that would have been hatred if it had anywhere external to go. “You’re not tally and debt and sum. Don’t let them make you count like that.”

“Everything counts like that,” Doctor Sen said, almost apologizing to no one. He had moved to the window and hooded a hand against the glass as if the darkness might glare back. “That’s why we mark, and meant, and weighed, and said in writing so it’s not forgotten when we are stiff and they are young and everyone’s lying. Counting is the only real kindness we ever invented, because it lets us give and know what we’ve given.”

“And take and make it seem like a game,” Mira said, but without heat now, because she respected a good mechanic even if the machine was in charge. She stood and brushed her palms and left streaks of old soot across her thighs. So many clothes in the new era were memorials to tresrpass. “What’s the cost,” she said, to Eveline. “For the pen. For the rule. For us.”

Eveline did not pretend ignorance. The Calamus lay across her palms like a thin animal that has learned where warmth is and refuses to learn the word No. “Every time I write,” she said—and it was strangely, stupidly difficult to lie about this to these two; she would have been capable of it with anyone else—“the part of me that is still complicated becomes less. Some little story unfastens. A taste, a smell, a trivial memory of biting my lip hard enough to bleed when I was seven because a boy named Linus told me I wasn’t brave. A worse thing. A better thing. And something of the house clings when it shouldn’t. You heard her. We all are, now. That’s the bargain. I owe it what my family owed it, which is to be its hand when it cares about us. In exchange, it doesn’t spit us out.”

“That’s a poor exchange,” Mira said, and Doctor Sen made a noise that meant he agreed and that agreeing was his very worst habit.

“It’s the exchange we have,” Eveline said. “And it bought us a night with an intact door. Do you remember when a door was just a door. I do. Moments. How ordinary it was to hate when your mother called you to supper while you were reading. What a terrible waste it is that I remember that. How useful.”

Mira crossed the kitchen and leaned her hip against the edge of a counter that had only recently begun to remember it was a thing that existed. “I am not going to let you write until you are nothing but finger bones and a laugh,” she said. “I have loved too many ghosts already. I want to love this world instead, the one with knives and beans and babies that fall asleep on your forearm and make your hand tingle until you weep.”

“We can set a tether,” Doctor Sen said, turning away from the window with a scholar’s greed disguised as concern. The beetle case in his pocket tapped gently against the wooden panel as he moved, as if it wanted to be let out to crawl the grain of a railing that remembered forests. “It doesn’t have to be a name, not if the pen is as old as it pretends. We can call you by a list of negations. We can write—” and here his face lit, because a good sentence makes a good man glow—“She who is not given, not taken, not counted in the inventory of the dead, will be present when called by those who learned her before and those she teaches after.”

Mira made a face like a cat realizing its tail is on fire, impressed and annoyed all at once. “That’s ugly,” she said. “It will work. The ugliness means it isn’t trying to be pretty instead of true.”

“I have found that, too,” Doctor Sen admitted, and his hand hovered in the air, wanting the pen and not daring to want it too publicly. “We should write it now, before any more of us forget what it felt like under the door.”

Eveline lifted the Calamus and did not write. The house did not push. It waited like a forest does for you to decide whether you will take the path or the moss. “The more I give myself rules,” she said, “the more it will obey me on the parts I would rather stayed wild. Do you know what my family did, with a thing like this. They wrote rules about other people and called it fairness. They wrote rules about weather and called it agriculture. They wrote rules about food and called it trade. They wrote rules about marriage and called it safety. They weren’t devils. They were bored.”

“Ah,” Mira said, which is the kindest a friend can be to someone who has just done the trick of judging her dead and loving them anyway. She stretched her shoulders and the bells on the bat chimed a little, finally free of her thumb. “Then we won’t write that, yet. We’ll write something petty and immediate, because we are not bored. We are very busy. We will write a rule about water, or about how many eyes you must paste on a window to keep a baby from choking on a peach stone while the monkeys laugh.”

“Water,” Doctor Sen said at once, because he had already stacked ten problems in his head and water was the bottom of that stack and the one that made the rest wobble. “We can write that any vessel taken from the south cistern will never be hoarded, and will seek its way to a mouth with need. We can write that the river will not poison who comes to speak politely to its edge, and will drown quickly who empties it with greed. We can write an oath people like—a poem, ugly, true—that children can learn and old men can repeat when they are drunk.”

Eveline, who had once been given poems as gifts the way some girls were given horses, felt a small pulse of hope under her ribs. “We can write that water is common, even here. Common,” she said again, savoring it. “The old word for the share that isn’t owned.”

“Careful,” Great-Aunt said from the wall, a thin smile in her voice for the first time that didn’t need to cut to draw blood. “That word burned our house once already.”

“Then let it burn again,” Mira said. “We’ve got candles.”

Eveline set the nib above the empty wooden counter where a chopping block had once been and would be and brought it down, slow, so the pen could choose its pace, so the house could lean in and smell. She wrote in strokes that were not letters to anyone who had been schooled under gaslight, but that laid themselves down on the world with the inexorable logic of rain on granite. She wrote that water does not belong to men and that a man who says otherwise will hear monkeys laughing when he sleeps and deserve it. She wrote that containers made for water remember their shapes and will whisper their purpose to any hand, so that a child will pick up a jar and know what it is for without being taught. She wrote that clean hands are clean because of acts, not occupation, and that hands in need are clean for as long as it takes to fill a cup.

The Calamus sang a little, as if something far away on a marsh had lifted its head and decided to forgive. The house breathed relief. In the roof, near the chimneys that had not drawn in a decade and still dreamed in their own brick minds of smoke like sugar, a troop of macaques began to chant a nonsense phrase that had always had the cadence of an oath even when it meant nothing but you smell good and I am your friend for the next fifteen minutes.

“You look pale,” Mira said, and it was a ridiculous understatement because Eveline had left pale behind an hour ago and was now moving through various shades of tidewater, translucence and leftover light. “Drink something.” She thrust a cup at her as if cups had ever solved anything except the immediate problem of thirst. The cup felt present in Eveline’s hand as if the rule had worked backward into the object, staking it to usefulness. The water tasted of copper and leaf and days that had not yet been wasted.

“That cost less,” Eveline said, lowering the cup and resting the pen’s shaft against her collarbone like a thief considering an honest living. “Perhaps kindness is cheap and we priced it wrong.”

“Or perhaps you’re made to pay brutally when you try to keep anything for yourself,” Doctor Sen said with the flatness of someone who has watched it true too often. He keeps a ledger and does not invent patterns. He records.

They did not sleep. Sleep was for people who had not just rewritten the cheapest public good in a city infested by devils and cousins. The night grew thick outside and warm inside. The portraits held counsel among themselves in the tiny shifts of pigment that indicate the painting of consideration, and the sounds were almost comforting because they were human: someone’s wheeze inherited like money, someone else’s way of saying yes that sounded like disapproval, the click of a ring against a chair, the weight of an opinion sliding into the world.

At some wet and undefinable hour when the oldest monkeys usually get up to pee and then decide to move to a different branch for the novelty, a hand tapped lightly at the window that used to love the morning. It was a knuckle-nail, careful, like a teaspoon against a glass to draw a toast. Mira was there before anyone else because the sound had hit the place in her ear where danger lives as if a bell had rung in her chest. She lifted the latch of habit and found nothing on the sill but a small string of bottle caps threaded on a frayed red ribbon that had once been a little girl’s hair bow. There was a stone tied at one end and a good knot at the other.

“Their post,” Doctor Sen said, delighted and wary. “We have mail.”

Mira held the thing as one holds anything from the world that might have a bite in it, affectionate but out from the body. “It’s not angry,” she said. “It’s too straight for anger.” She brought it to the table and unknotted it and out slid, like a spill of fish, three white pebbles, a piece of green glass with a pleasing curve, and a coin from the era of municipal poets. The coin had a hole in it, a neat one too regular to be monkey work.

Eveline leaned in because she knew a letter when she saw one even if it had been written in pebbles and the dried spit of creatures that do not like to be caught thinking. The three pebbles said: we saw. The green glass said: we liked the trick. The coin said: don’t try it on us.

“Good,” Eveline said, well pleased. “We won’t.” She picked up the coin and slid it back under the red ribbon and tied a knot around a knot, hearts beating in time with the calm, complicated hands it takes to make a knot good. Then she added, with a flourish of her own, a scrap of paper torn from the old ledger that had been on the wall near the door and written on it with a pencil stub: We don’t write you. She had no idea if they liked seeing marks. They likely liked the taste of the graphite better than the words, which was an honest preference if ever there was one.

When she stepped to the window to tuck the bit of ribbon back into the sill, a face hovered by the frame on the other side, very close, unstartled. It belonged to a monkey old enough that the eyes had gone to glass and the skin above them had furrowed into a welter of maps. He put his tongue out at her, a long, careful gesture like a girl eavesdropping on a joke she knows she’s too young to be part of and wants you to know she’s clever anyway. He touched the red ribbon gently, like a man touching the hem of a dress, and withdrew into the eventful dark.

“Friends,” Mira said, not trusting the word and loving it anyway. She tied the bells back around her bat with the silence of someone who has decided not to punch anyone until morning.

They returned to the Hall because the house wanted them there and because if they were going to spend their selves like money they wanted to spend it where the accounting could be neat. Down the shallow steps, past the air that moved as if a parade had walked through a moment before and left perfume. The bone sheets on the walls were restless, their grooves a little darker under the push of an idea rolling down them. Doctor Sen could not help it; he put his hand to each frame, fingertips lightly pressed as if feeling a pulse, and named them under his breath: Buffalo. Sperm whale. Cow. The old ways of writing were so often insult and theft and limited justice that even the romance of them had to be counted in flinches.

Mira was the one who saw, at the end of the table, the small drawer that had not been there earlier and now was, affronted that no one had noticed it at once. She tugged it open with a thumb and it came smoothly, a courteous tongue. Inside lay a sheaf of papers not bone, very pale, almost cloth. On the top sheet, I AM NOT YOUR QUEEN was written, in a hand Eveline recognized with a shock as if she had bitten something that looked like almond and tasted of poison. It was her own, left somewhere, right now, not now.

She touched the page and the ink did not smudge, which told her that the house knew better than to trust humans with fresh things. She read and the words were as much a letter as the bottle caps had been, but angrier. She had written them, once or later, perhaps on a stair, perhaps on her knees as smoke fell around her like oils marrying in a pan. The lines spoke of the way a family can decide you are furniture and then set you on fire when it is chilly, of the way a city can tell itself it is grateful when what it is is hungry, of the way a pen can eat you and you can enjoy it enough that you do not care that you are gone. At the bottom, instead of a signature, there was an old joke: a little picture of a cat with its teeth showing.

Mira read over her shoulder, then pressed her mouth against her own knuckles until the bones changed color. “How many letters did you leave yourself,” she asked, as if it were a good thing to count, as if there could be a number one might say and have the grief for it be manageable.

“Enough that you would find me,” Eveline said, and then because that sounded like theft, she added, “Enough that I would find you.”

Doctor Sen put his hand over the pile because men have their uses and one of them is stopping the women from going all the way down into the place grief lives and getting lost there. “Tomorrow,” he said, with the certainty of the very tired. “We will read them when the light is stupid and honest. Now we should write a list of what we can do that won’t cost Eveline her whole head on the first day.”

“Water was good,” Mira conceded. “We can write about the floods. We can write that the water remembers children and lifts them before it lifts anyone else.”

“That is better than good,” Doctor Sen said, because he was the sort of person who could remain moved by the thought of children being set above floodwaters after two decades of not having any of his own left to be lifted. “What else.”

“Food,” Eveline said, because she was frightened and practical. “We can write a fairness into the garden gate. We can write that anything planted with a hand that has stolen will rot before sprouting. We can write that anything planted by someone who grieves will produce twice. We can write that anyone who tries to sell seed in packets with promises on them will find goats in their bed.” She smiled at the last and Mira snorted, forgiveness sneaking in the way humor often does, disguised as contempt.

“Goats,” Doctor Sen said, making a note in the air with his finger, because some men always take minutes even when they don’t have paper. “We can find goats, if we must make it literal. I know a boy who knows a man who knows a woman who breeds them with a nose for lies.”

“Everyone in this city knows that woman,” Mira said dryly. “She refused to sell to the Council because their coin smelled like metal instead of sweat. The monkeys send her fruit that looks exactly like the people who stole it, and she bites it.”

“Then she is our minister of consequences,” Eveline said, as if you could appoint such things and have them be real. Perhaps you could, now. Perhaps the pen made titles into work instead of ribbon.

They wrote sparingly, like the poor spend good almonds. A line and a pause. A rule and a cup of water. They took turns naming and the pen accepted that, which meant it didn’t care about authorship the way universities do. It wanted intent. It wanted the soft, direct heat of a decision. When Mira spoke the rule about children and floods, the reed sang and the house aligned around something it had already believed. When Doctor Sen spoke the rule about planting grief and harvests, the reed hummed very low as if under his voice another voice agreed with teeth bared. When Eveline wrote the bit about goats, the pen laughed, which was terrifying for a thing without lungs. She did not resent that it had a sense of humor. She had always been grateful that tools can sometimes save you by finding you ridiculous.

At dawn, they were wrecked. The window let in a ribbon of white so narrow and clean that each speck of dust became a planet. The city woke the way it always had when it was not waking into war: roosters that were some man’s religion, a cough on a balcony where a woman had slept and waited for a lover who had died five years ago and still came on particular mornings, a bicycle somebody had resuscitated clattering down cobbles and singing with spinning playing cards. The monkeys greeted the sun the way they greet everything, noisily and with detail. They enumerated it. They cataloged. They lit their noses with it and made inventories of each other’s fleas.

Eveline’s hand was worse. It was a problem for later, which made it the sort of problem that eats you whole if you respect it. She tucked it into the bag next to the place where the pen slept when it pretended to, and the leather welcomed it the way old leather always remembers the weight of something that ruined it and loved it and went away. Mira saw her hide her hand and did not argue, which is another kind of love.

In the alley outside SUGAR & SON, they could hear voices, more than the usual, growing like mold grows—quietly, thickly, and sudden. Someone had already heard. That is the way of any honest rumor. Children are always first to trust the improbable because their lives are improbable by design. A boy with a shaved head and a scar like a galaxy under one eye stood on one foot and then the other and cried up at the window without care that walls dislike being shouted at: “Is it true. Is there water that doesn’t get stolen on the way home. My mother says you’re telling lies.”

“Tell your mother to bring her cup,” Mira called back, and the boy grinned like being forgiven had been what he wanted all along.

“Tell your mother to wash her hands and curse us properly,” Eveline added, because a ritual without profanity is only half a spell, and the boy laughed and mimed washing in the air and went clamoring down the alley, word already jumping from his shoulders to somebody else’s.

Doctor Sen closed his eyes and put his forehead against the wall as if checking a fever. He breathed in a column and out a column and counted the dust under his breath: one, two, many, more. “Be small,” he said, to himself or the house or the day. “Please be small a little longer.”

“It won’t,” Mira said, kind and ruthless. “It’s a show. People will come to see if the goats in their beds is a joke and if we’re fools and if they can take the pen and if the monkeys will let them climb on them. We’ll have to decide if we are a festival or a barricade.”

Eveline felt a little thrill at the words because she had always liked a barricade from the safety of a balcony, and it was one of the dozens of habits she had decided to confess daily for a while. “We are a practice,” she said. “That’s the word I want. We’re the way people act when they put their mouths where their hands are. We will have hours. We will have a bell. We will have a rule that a fight is a fight and a duel is a duel and neither is allowed without someone you respect watching.”

Mira looked at her sideways. “You wrote that last bit in before you said it,” she said. “You always used to do that. You make a grand speech and then act like you’ve only now thought of it. It’s disgusting.”

“It works,” Eveline said, and had the grace to blush, even if the flush moved weirdly in a face lit from the wrong side of its own bone. She rubbed her lip where the old scar was and it felt like a thing, which made her feel like weeping and prayer and hunger all at once. She swallowed it and looked at the two people who made her alive in the world in the way that mattered and said, “Breakfast,” with the authority of a child playing house. “We will write nothing else until we have eaten something that will disgust the house and make it cough on its own ashes.”

Mira produced from the depths of a bag that had once been hung under a baby on a bicycle seat a heel of bread, two small green cheeses wrapped in leaves, and a fistful of almonds she had been saving for when she needed to bribe a judge into being human. “Fish,” Doctor Sen said, appearing suddenly with a tin whose label had been bleached into a ghost of foreign letters. “Anchovies. We are decadent.”

They ate like prisoners, swiftly, each mouthful a decision not to speak. The house complained at the smell of the fish like a hermit harassed by boys. The monkeys banged complaints on the gutter because none of the tins had been opened with proper pomp. The sun made the glass in the windows look briefly like water. For a handful of heartbeats, this was a kitchen again, and not a hall where rules were written because the world had forgotten how to behave.

Then the door knocked, and this time it wasn’t knuckle or bottle cap or polite, and they were in the business again of triage and spectacle and democracy in the sense used by drowning men hauling each other into boats. Eveline picked up the pen and her hand with it, and Mira picked up the bat and Friends as a word, and Doctor Sen picked up his case of small dead bright things as if the beetles could teach him again the trick of beauty preserved beyond use. The house straightened into its spine. The portraits arranged their expressions. The monkeys took their places in the gallery they had always carved out of any human stupidity, and the day leaned in, a student, to see what was next.The knock was the sound of a fist that had learned itself against crates and doors and ribs. It had the rhythm of trade, impatient, honest in its way. Mira went because a bat needs distance to sing, and Doctor Sen went because kindness, badly managed, can be fatal. Eveline stood a step back and lifted the Calamus so that it lay along her palm like a quieting knife and the house, sensible for once, unlatched in a manner that allowed a narrow, decent crack.

They had come as a living list. A woman with a baby in a sling made of the leg of a pair of jeans. A boy with a bucket that had once held paint and now smelled only of hope. An old man who had combed his hair and found nothing there and still combed. Two girls in jerseys that had belonged to some team that had met every Thursday before everything stopped pretending to be a schedule. A person whose personhood was stubborn in the face of anyone insisting otherwise, all angles and careful stance and a pin in the ear that said: I am made of decisions. Behind them, curious, late, the kind of men who are never on time to anything but a fight.

“Hands,” Mira said, brisk as a nurse a century late. “Show them. Speak your names. If you cannot speak the truth of your name, you may not be thirsty enough for our water.”

The baby woke and announced that being alive was exciting and fraught. The woman rocked and adjusted and kept her hands up, palms forward to show the crescent moons of dirt in the lifeline and the day’s scrubbing done in a basin with a sponge that had once cleaned an engine. “Ana,” she said, and then because she was not a fool, “Ana de los Reyes if you insist, but no one has insisted in a while.”

“Welcome, Ana,” Doctor Sen said, and the wet gratitude that came into her face would have been indecent to watch if any of them had been young enough to be embarrassed by need. He gestured toward a low basin they had found and scrubbed with a brush that had taken hair and rope to make and that had satisfied the house like a scraped throat. “Wash. Curse us while you do, so the house knows we aren’t priests.”

“May you all grow warts on your clever tongues,” Ana said softly, smiling at the baby who grinned back as if introduced to a custom she had been waiting to learn, and she dipped her hands and the water was exactly cold enough to make a prayer unnecessary. Eveline felt the rule she had written lean forward to sniff, then settle back, pleased in the small way of a cat who has been offered milk on a saucer and finds the saucer clean.

The boy in the jersey was named Emmett in the voice of a friend who had said his name into his ear every time he had been about to climb something he shouldn’t. He had a purple lollipop blister on his lip and a scab shaped like a continent on his knee and the kind of insolence children can only manage when they have not yet been taught that the world prefers them quiet. He held up his hands and they were filthy and he knew it and he dared them not to love him anyway. Mira dropped her chin and he scoured at the basin until his skin went the new color of slate and then darker and then a sort of pink that is a lesson and a threat.

“Speak,” Eveline said, because the pen wanted it said by her, and Emmett’s eyes slid over her and away the way sparrows do when a window is not quite glass. He looked at Doctor Sen and past him and spoke to the space between them because that’s where the house had taught the words to pool. “Emmett Clay,” he said, as if it were a dare. “My people are Suttree, River Mouth, Twenty-Two Steps. My mother said to say what street but the streets change.”

“You’re admitted,” the house breathed through the crack, and he flinched like someone had laced fingers into his hair, but there was only the smell of shellac and pepper and a sense that he had been weighed by something with a long memory and a faster forgiveness than he had expected.

They came and they said and they washed and they cursed, and the jars that had been collected by the cautious and the generous over a season of watchfulness made their own decisions. One of the brown bottles with a shoulder like a soldier peeled its mouth away from the others and rolled gently into the old man’s palm though his hands shook and his mouth made small regretful sounds as if he was apologizing to the water for being about to drink it. He looked at it like a man looks at a letter from a woman who has forgiven him too late and nodded once to Eveline without quite seeing her, then to Mira, who grunted, which is a language that accepts thanks and punishes flattery.

At the edge of the crowd, a woman with goats stood like a punctuation mark you had better not ignore. Two goats, cream-colored, sharp-faced, wore collars made of braided telephone wire and bits of copper that had been loved a hundred times by river and hand. The woman’s hair was not gray; it was thundercloud, and she had a mouth full of proverb. Her dress had been a man’s coat a war ago and now it had darts that told everyone that hands had been clever at midnight. A monkey leaned down from the gutter and tried to count the goats and then, affronted by their refusal to be enumerated by anyone but themselves, spat delicately onto its own forearm and made a mark to remind itself to keep an eye on them.

“You’re late,” Mira said, and the goats snorted as if to say that anyone who made goats wait would find their sleeves eaten.

“I wanted to see if your new rules smelled like lies.” The woman’s voice was river-bottom, calm and sedimented. “They don’t. They smell like damp paper and pen-craft and a certain kind of girl who believes that history is what you make for dinner and therefore she is a chef.” She winked at nobody. “I am Aunty Geeta if you need a name and if you don’t I am a rumor with hooves. This is Hearsay and this is Mischief, not because they live up to it but because names are warnings as much as they are invitations.”

“Hearsay has an underbite like a judge,” Doctor Sen said, delighted with the clean lines of the animal’s bad ideas, and Hearsay turned her head and considered him with an eye as old as laws and as willing to be amused.

“We wrote goats into a sentence,” Eveline said. “We hope you’re not offended.”

“I’m always offended,” Aunty Geeta said cheerfully. “It keeps the neighbors out of my arms. But I do like to see promises made with teeth. You said anyone who sells seeds with promises will find goats in their bed.” She smiled with all the charity of a butcher. “It’s good. It’s ugly, which means it may work. Who writes promises down nowadays? Fools. We say them in alleys and blow them like kisses and then shrug when they stick to someone else’s face. A goat knows a promise as well as any god. She smells the lie and eats the paper you waved around to make yourself taller.”

Mira, who had insulted a thousand men into decency and fed them soup afterward, looked at the goats and nodded very slowly. “We could use a minister,” she said. “We’ll need someone to hold the bell and choose who must speak their name first. We’ll need someone who can tell the difference between need and drama. We’ll need someone who isn’t afraid to bite.”

“I don’t bite,” Aunty Geeta said, and then bent and kissed Hearsay on the nose. Mischief bonked her head into Aunty Geeta’s thigh with the dignified irritation of a town elder corrected by a child and chewed thoughtfully on the strap of Mira’s bat until the bells jangled and the monkeys above reported it to everyone they could.

It was a festival, then, because the city will make a festival out of a funeral if there is light enough. People brought cups that had been trinkets and left with cups that had become sacraments, laughing and cursing and being made to speak the parts of their names they had hidden first out of necessity and then out of habit. A woman with hands like boats said she was Margo—no surname—and the door made her say Marguerite Lafitte like a tongue remembering a dance. A man who had twenty pockets and nothing in any of them said he was Needle and the door placed within his voice the small, correct weight of, “Nathaniel.” He scowled and then, caught by his own honesty, smiled, and for a moment looked like a boy who had once believed he would be famous for something gentle.

Not everyone passed. A slick fellow with a jacket he had made handsome by brushing it with a glove and a smile like a card trick tried to step across with his empty hands arranged artistically, and the house made a noise like a mother deciding that you weren’t old enough for the wine after all. “Who are you,” the crack in the door breathed, and he said, “I sell,” and the ash reached into his palms as sure and soft as a cat choosing a lap. He hissed, not because he was hurt, but because something had told him no and he had not heard that voice since his own father had died. Mia reached out and patted his cheek with the flat of her fingers, permission and warning. “Go sell something else,” she said. “Sorrow. Rain. Your own good looks. We’ve got water.”

Eveline watched and felt the rhythm of giving and receiving set itself along the grain of the day like a pattern in a cloth. The Calamus lay against her palm and drew breath when someone lied and exhaled when someone said something that would cost them later. It asked to be used and she did not lift it. The rules held; the house hummed; the monkeys began to gather their own little queues around the gutters and passed their babies down the line when the sun got hot and a shade of damp brick was better than the heat of a skull. The cost to her tugged and failed to be counted; a handful of notes blown, a bright thread pulled through a needle and snipped, a taste of cinnamon bread that went out of her mouth and would not come back. She understood at last something of the way her great-grandmother had smiled at her while forgetting how to fry an egg.

At midday, the river sent a messenger in a form no Council would have recognized as official. She was a girl who had been taught to carry her arms loose like ropes and her eyes hard like glass. She wore a ribbon that had been a warning to monopolists tied around her throat as decoration and had the flag of the River Safety Council woven into her belt as if it were a minor god she could afford to mock. She came alone, which was either bravery or the wisdom of someone who had seen apes fall upon a parade. She took off her shoes at the bottom of the steps without being told and washed her feet as well as her hands, which made even Great-Aunt’s portrait lift her painted brow in grudging admiration.

“Your Council sent you,” Doctor Sen said, seeing the way she stood and the way her mouth took the corners of commandments and chewed them.

“No,” the girl said. “My grandmother did. She said to tell you that your house breathes like a sleeping dog and that she remembers a time when men with hair and shoes like yours wore white gloves and carried umbrellas for the sun.” She looked at Mira’s bat as if it had been an old friend. “She sent a cake, but I ate it because cakes cannot be trusted not to go hard if you look at them too long. My name is Jessie Oates, I am not here for water, and if you give me a cup anyway I will pour it on my head and laugh.”

“Solomon’s,” Eveline said softly, half to see if the name would catch on her tongue and half because it made her feel like a person to know something she did not have to use.

“My father’s,” Jessie said, with the steadiness of someone who has decided to love a person who makes that difficult as a practice and not a sacrifice. “He said, to tell you that he meant what he said with his foolish mouth and that he has told the men to keep away unless they are thirsty and polite. He also said there’s a leak along the rails where the viaduct footings meet the echo tunnel, and he’s not wrong. We are stacking sand, but the monkeys are as interested in claims as they are in cucumbers and they threw half of it into the water to see what the splash would say. He also said if your goats shit on his boys’ blankets again he’ll eat them.” She smiled then, sudden and young and savage. “He won’t.”

Aunty Geeta snorted like a Horse of Empire. “He can come eat horns first. They suit him. Tell him Hearsay asked if he will wash his hands and curse properly before touching her trough, the way a man ought to address a lady.”

Jessie grinned and flicked a glance up at the rafters where a langur with a mane like a powdered wig had draped herself like a widow at an opera. “The monkeys sent me too,” she said as if delivering two messages at once was the law of her blood. “They told me to tell you that they like your trick with the door, but if you write a rule about them they will take the hinges and throw them in the river and come in on the roof singing. They sent a feather for your hat and a piece of gum because they are not clear on our appetites.”

“Their gum tastes of boot and pepper,” Doctor Sen said, as someone dropped a packet of brittle gray into his palm from above. He sniffed and smiled. “They have been to the film houses again.”

“We won’t write them,” Eveline said aloud, toward the gutters and toward the girl and toward the part of the house that listened to threats as if they were poems. “We will write around them. Like you write around a river when it floods where it wants.”

Jessie’s gaze skipped past Eveline and snagged on the pen the way a fish hooks itself on a line it did not know it was biting. Her eyes narrowed, not with greed, but with that particular tenderness some people feel for good tools. “That’s your knife,” she said. “My grandmother taught me how to keep an edge with oil and a stone and to never put good steel in stew. She said I should tell you to hide it from the sun and from your own generosity.”

“That grandmother will be invited to tell us what to do whenever we feel ourselves becoming clever,” Mira said, and the girls snorted in harmony like women who had not yet decided if they would be friends and had already forgiven each other for it.

It was a show until the day paused for breath and checked its pockets for a coin and found a fear it had not had room to carry earlier. A shout came from the courtyard where somebody had taken off their shoes to feel the old stone with their heels and had been mocked for being sentimental by someone who would later be found crying in a toilet. The shout was small and then large and then went bright and impossible, which is how a mother sounds when she has seen her child in water. Emmett had been a boy on a step with a jar making the sound water makes when it’s happy to be contained, and then he was a boy being not on a step. The cistern along the south wall had kissed him, quick and uninvited, and one small body cannot always manage the romance water offers.

Mira ran. She and the bat learned each other steps ago and now it was another limb. The people fell back. The monkeys went forward because they are brutal when it matters. The house, which had pretended to be indifferent to everything except ink and memory for a decade, took a breath and held it until someone remembered the rule that had been written for children and river and flood and said it out loud so that the world would be embarrassed enough to abide by it. Doctor Sen’s voice, very calm, as if telling a beetle about the pin: “Any flood shall lift the smallest first.”

The cistern, which was not a flood and did not see itself in that story, considered. The rule slid along its clay and carried with it the scent of Eveline’s hand and the taste of her last memory of bread and the exact pitch of Mira’s curse at the men that morning. It decided to be an obedient thing for once in its underwhelming life and upended its own small sea. The water lifted Emmett like a saint in a story about a better god and held him there as if presenting him to the city that had ordered this trick for a price no one had agreed to. He coughed water the color of pennies and began to cry because it is humiliating to be saved by something so gentle. The monkeys erupted in a chatter like thrown rice. The house creaked and tried to act as if its beams had not softened with relief. The crowd shook and turned its relief into anger because the body prefers fight to tremble, and the boy’s mother arrived and cuffed him lightly and held him so hard his ribs would ache later in a way that would feel like a promise.

“We will make a sign,” Aunty Geeta announced to the world, because you must take events and pin them to a board or they escape. “Small children stand back,” she said in the voice of a goddess tired of babysitting. “Tall ones watch them. All of you stop holding your mouths open. It is unbecoming and invites mosquitoes.”

Eveline had not moved. This is the kind of thing that makes a person beloved or loathed; the holding of steady when everyone else runs. She had wanted to run. She had wanted to dive into the cistern and demand the water declare its loyalties and take little Emmett into her arms and pretend to feel his bones. Instead she had stood and felt the rule she had written work, and in working it pulled from her with a neat little bite a small sound she had not known was important until it was gone: the sigh her mother had made when cutting crusts from bread. It vanished as if someone had wrapped it like a gift and spirited it away under their coat, and she stood and smiled because the trick had worked and because she was a person who knew how to smile when she lost things. Mira came back with the wet boy tucked under one arm like a parcel that had paid extra for fragile handling and looked at Eveline as if checking that she were still visible.

“Don’t hide that you’re getting thinner,” she said in a voice that belonged to an older woman and a younger one, both equally ruthless. “You hide the pen. You show me.”

“I am trying to find a way to be extravagantly alive in front of your face,” Eveline said lightly, and Mira made an infuriated noise that could have been a sob’s cousin if it had been granted an education.

The day made itself long out of respect for how much they were trying and failed to be obedient to any kindness beyond the small. People came and went and a ritual emerged because rituals are just the stories we have time to tell while we do the work. A bell arrived courtesy of a colobus with a scar across her nose and an expression like a living library; it had been a ship’s bell once and a child’s toy and attractive to crows, and now it chimed as if it had been introduced to its true vocation. Aunty Geeta took it without thanking anyone because gratitude is a spice best saved and rang it at the top of the hour and sometimes at the half because she disliked predictability. The painted children along the hall yawned and shifted and declared that anyone wearing a hat indoors would be required to tell a joke before receiving water. The jokes improved along with the quality of the washing. A place to sit appeared near the door, the house deciding that you are kinder if you have a chair. A bench made of two stone lions who had once guarded something that had not needed guarding and were delighted at last to be useful bore, at one point, a row of monkeys who had instituted for themselves a very serious queue in which grooming and bribery were both permitted.

In the quiet pockets—so small the house had to fold and refold them like napkins—Doctor Sen read a letter, the ones Eveline had written to herself, and said nothing until he had finished the paragraph in which she had discussed, with calm poise, which of her bones she would prefer to become fluent in first. He put the paper down and looked at her and then away and wrote a note in his head. He would not ask her to stop. He would ask her to be clumsy. He would ask her to make mistakes with the pen so that it learned that she was not to be trusted entirely, the way a child learns to be careful with a clever cat. He rehearsed the sentence in which he would say this and practiced saying it to a beetle that had died under glass and had been saying nothing beautifully for twenty years.

Toward evening, a woman came who made the house nervous and the goats thoughtful and the monkeys curious in a way they did not care to admit. She wore a black dress that had been black before there was any reason to wear black, and a scarf that had once been a banner and was now a neck. Her mouth was a bright beak and her hands were teaching hands. People made a little space for her without quite noticing they had. She did not wash at the basin. She stepped over it and put her unclean hands on the old marble of the doorframe and murmured a thing that was neither curse nor prayer and that the house did not like to hear.

“I taught your aunt to do sums,” she said to Eveline though her eyes had not landed properly and might never. “The hard kind. Not the addition of money. The subtraction of men.” Her smile was a tidy light. “I am Miss Havering, because names should tell you who is coming. I did the books for farmers and then for cities and then for people who are not supposed to be counted. I am here to see your contract hall and to tell you that you have made a stage on which they will play their favorite game.”

“And what game is that,” Mira asked, with the posture of a bat leaned against a wall, comfortable and ready to fly across a skull.

“Tactics dressed as morals,” Miss Havering said, and her hand hovered three inches from the air as if it were a cheek. “They will say that your rules are beautiful and then they will bring exceptions. They will say that your water is a miracle and then they will ask you to forgive a man for being thirsty. They will bring you their starving and demand the pen write forgiveness on their mouths. They will ask you to sign their good intentions onto the bones of their plans. They will forget the part about their own hands.” She stepped inside because she had no choice given the way the door had decided to love her for saying hard things. “Do it anyway. I will help.” She cocked her head as if listening to a bird in a gutter. “My niece married a man with hands like yours and he took to writing laws like a goose takes to water. They are divorced.”

“What will you want,” Eveline asked politely, because all allies cost.

“A table that balances,” Miss Havering said. “A chair that does not collapse under the weight of my opinions. A chance to write an exception only when it makes a rule more true. A cup of water poured on my head occasionally, because I hate it and it’s good for me.” She put her hand not on the pen but near it and bowed the slightest, oddest bow Eveline had ever seen; it was a bow executed to a mathematics. “And your permission to insult your dead when they are in the way.”

Great-Aunt, who had been bored to tears for an hour of good deeds, perked up. “Finally,” she breathed. “A woman with a profession.”

They made, clumsily, a council. The word choked everyone the first time it was said; it had become suspicious by association. They did not give themselves titles, not because they were humble but because names begin to do the work you ask of them too soon and they were not prepared to be chairs, treasurers, or sergeants except of their own temper. Aunty Geeta and Miss Havering took opposite ends of the table and nodded once like cats seeing one another in a mirror and choosing not to fight today. Doctor Sen placed his beetle case where he could see it and let his hands learn the shape of minutes without a binder. Mira stood and sat and stood and leaned and sat again, a pendulum that kept the time of refusal and consent. Eveline did not sit. She stood because a woman with a pen should be capable of standing in a room forever and writing down judgments without feeling that her knees were involved.

They took complaints and disputes and questions and returned them in the order that made the room less likely to explode. A boy demanded the right to paste the eyes back onto bins and crates without having them peeled as offerings by macaques; a troop of small primates offended at the implication that they had no aesthetic looked down their noses at him and presented a bin lid with eyes so beautifully pasted that the boy shut his mouth and clutched it and went away with a new tenderness for theft. A woman wanted to know if a man who had left when the lights went off and returned when the water ran could be declared a liability and marked with a chalk. Miss Havering asked her very gently if she would like to live in a city where men were marked with chalk, and the woman cried in the low, private way of those who had not allowed themselves tears because their cheeks had not felt trustworthy. Aunty Geeta harumphed and said that goats prefer chalk. They eat it when they are short on salt. She produced a bag of salt from somewhere that had been a library and told the woman to take it and remember that a city is not a marriage, it is a neighbor. The woman bowed as if someone had shown her how to be tall without a man to tie the notion to and left, both angry and fed.

In a pause when the monkeys coughed up someone’s pilfered watch onto the sill out of sheer bored conscience, Doctor Sen leaned toward Eveline and said as if announcing a party game, “Make a mistake.”

“I beg your pardon,” she said, pleased despite herself, because she had been waiting for the hard work of being spoiled.

“Write something slightly wrong,” he said, low, intent, eyes bright with the unkind kindness of a man who has a grant proposal for mercy. “Write it with a flourish you mean. Make the pen learn that you can be clumsy and that the house will not break when it catches you. Show yourself you can write badly and fix it later. Otherwise you will be a better tool than anyone deserves and you will be gone.”

It was a heinous idea. It was also, immediately, a rule. She lifted the reed and thought about something that mattered little enough to dirty. She thought of windows and pasted eyes and monkeys peeling them away as if to undress a shy god. “I write,” she said, and the house leaned in, and the injunction moved in the air like a moth deciding which candle to die beside, “that any eye pasted on a window shall render the room safe from coughing at night, even if there is mold, and shall make infants sleep for as long as a grown woman’s patience lasts.”

There was a shiver through the wood. Somewhere, a child’s cough did not ease. Somewhere else, a new mother put her head in her arms and waited to feel the weight of bargain against her neck, and nothing changed except her pity for herself. The monkeys looked at one another, deeply entertained at the idea that paper circles and childish pupils could force sleep onto something as contrary as a baby. A portrait of a man who had never held a baby in his life raised his painted glass and made a face like a toast to folly.

“Wrong,” Miss Havering said, brisk, good, unbearable. “Fix it. Write that a pasted eye is company for a lonely room and will remind those inside that watching is a choice and not a duty. We cannot write the sleep of infants without paying a price in the lungs of old men.”

Eveline wrote what she was told because writing as a good soldier is sometimes as important as writing like a queen. The rule settled itself like a shawl and the house, shamed and placated, went on breathing. Doctor Sen exhaled and looked like a man who had been holding a string tied to a tooth and was relieved not to have to pull. Eveline felt something release, deep in the place where her ankles had once carried her up stairs two at a time, and she did not know whether it was the house having forgiven her or the pen having decided to keep her for another hour.

By the time the sun admitted its own exhaustion and collapsed into the usual messy crimson, they had a line of faces in their heads and a catalog of names and curses that would do for a winter. The goats had fallen asleep in a sunpool and snored without remorse. The bell had the louche slant of a man at a bar at closing. The water had begun to feel like something that belonged to everyone and to the house, which is the only way anything belonging to anyone works. The monkeys, as the day turned, made a low sound that meant the world is about to change again; be ridiculous about it, please. They held their babies by the feet and tickled them into calm. They watched people put their shoes back on and go down the steps and stand for a moment in the alley and choose a direction that would always be away and toward both, because in a city that is breathing and hissing and telling stories at once direction is only an agreement, never a fact.

Jessie Oates came back after sunset with her hair damp and her cheeks offended from having been laughed at and looked at in the same hour. “He says you’re witches,” she said without preface, because a girl with a message in this era does not waste anyone’s patience. “He says it with admiration and threat. He says he’ll bring wood for your door because it will be a bad season. He says he won’t speak his name at your threshold ever again and that if any of your men come to his quarter they should keep their names under their hats because men without names are cheaper to bury.”

“Tell him we’ll bury anyone,” Mira said, equal parts promise and temper. “Tell him to bring the wood and to stop calling women witches unless he plans to be their cat.”

Jessie laughed and rocked on her toes and tipped a look at Eveline, curious and shrewd and somehow kind. “You don’t eat,” she said, not as a criticism; as a piece of information that had to fit on the same shelf where the pen lived. “My grandmother said it takes the meat right out of you to hold a thing like that. She said when she was a girl there was an old man who could call fish and he never ate, either. He looked like a lesson and a bishop. He was murdered by his nephew with a brick.”

“I will try not to have a nephew,” Eveline said gravely, and Jessie’s mouth twitched as if refusing humor was more work than she was willing to do.

The last to arrive were the kind who are always last: those who had been waiting to be sure no one was counting. A man with a bandage where an ear had been, not unlike Doctor Sen and therefore respectful for that alone. A woman who had shaved her head not as an act of rebellion or faith but because she had gotten tired of her hair tugged by the small hand of a child she had buried. Two boys who called themselves cousins and were not; when they spoke their names the house made their voices wrap around each other and they glanced away, shy and proud. They took water and left and left a piece of string and a button and a small, cracked mirror on the step because payments are a habit that can make a scarcity cheaper. The mirror caught Eveline as she stood with the pen lazily at her wrist and for a raw, mean second she saw herself with a face caught between smoke and chalk. It was not unlovely. It was alarming.

When the door closed at last, it did not shut. It settled into itself and left a breath between jamb and leaf as if a thought might need to pass during the night and it did not wish to catch it. The house shifted its ribs and dropped its shoulders and otherwise comported itself as an old thing relieved to be tired of something worthwhile. Mira put the bells into a jar to keep them from waking her with their memories. Aunty Geeta tied her goats to a baluster with a knot that was not a knot but a trick the goats were taught as babies that convinced them they were tethered to a promise. Miss Havering had a checkered napkin she unfolded and laid over a stack of papers as if the papers were a pie and butter would keep them gentle. Doctor Sen counted beetles without names and assigned them numbers and felt, for the first time in a while, hopeful about the future of arithmetic.

Eveline went to the Hall because a person visits the place that is making them disappear the way you visit a dying parent: often, tenderly, with bribes and rude jokes. The bone walls glowed with the absence of light. The table made the sound of a spider walking on glass. The letters she had written were still new enough that they put up their heads when she entered and lay down when she told them to. In the drawer where she had found her own words earlier lay now a small scrap of something that had never been paper. It was a leaf, pressed and pressed again, until it had given up its green and kept only the shape of its veins, which looked like a city the way a child draws one, arterial and full of alleys. On it, scratched with something that had once been a nail and was now a needle and would one day be a fishhook, someone had written: You liked to stand on chairs when you were seven. You fell and cracked your chin. You cried blood into your mother’s apron and she laughed so you would not be afraid of your own red. You will forget this tomorrow. Do not be ashamed.

She wouldn’t have said it aloud, but if somebody had asked, she would have admitted she had not remembered this even now until the letters told her. She put the leaf in her mouth for a moment like a sacrament and it tasted of dust and marrow. She put it back in the drawer and closed it very gently and lay the pen down and put her hand over it and felt, not wood, not bone, not anything, and decided to be brave about it before anyone had to ask her.

In the roof, above the Hall, the monkeys came to their private agreements. They critiqued the bell. They decided not to steal it. They sniffed at the new rules and concluded that while they were clearly written by apes who had taught themselves to forget what they were, they would bear watching because humor had gotten into them and anything that can laugh ought to be trusted for at least a day. The colobus with her nun’s headdress arranged her fur around her knees and made the small movement that meant: tell the children not to piss on the portraits; they bite with their eyes. A macaque whose tail had been broken in three places twice by stupid, hungry men made the sound that meant: keep a peach near; there will be visitors tonight who insist they do not like fruit and they will need to be taught.

In her alcove on the stair where the evening kept its leftover light, Eveline stood very still and practiced the act of existing where personhood is a thin soup. There is a way to stand when you are visible and a way to stand when you are not and a way to stand when you are both. She found a third point between the two and balanced there like a plate spinning on a rod, thinking of nothing and everything and the exact angle at which a reed is most honest. She did not hear the first foot on the step and did not startle when the breath arrived; she had already decided to be generous to all things with breath.

“We’re going to need bread every morning,” Mira said from two steps below out of the dark that she wore like a dress for special occasions. “And a man with a pencil who doesn’t think the pencil is a sword. And a woman who will agree to learn to ring a bell on time and swear at children without breaking their hearts.”

“We have got two of those already,” Eveline said, feeling the shape of her mouth with her tongue because sometimes that’s all the proof you get. “We will find a man who thinks his pencil is a spoon and will feed us with it. We will hire Miss Havering to tell us who is lying and Aunty Geeta to show us the baskets in which to put the lies. We will hire the monkeys as security and pay them in compliments worthy of their contempt. We will become insufferable and correct and hungry. We will write a rule that breakfast is served to anyone who can tell a good joke while washing their hands.”

Mira leaned into the banister that had been polished by a century of small men carrying great things and sighed so hard the house moved half an inch and then put itself back without complaint. “You forgot,” she said, without cruelty and without making it a question.

“This hour I forgot,” Eveline said. “Next hour I will remember. I suspect it will be exhausting, like a song with too many verses and a chorus you adore.”

Mira reached up and did not touch her and their hands arranged themselves in the air beside each other like doves alit on the same wire and not minding the electricity. “Sleep near me,” she said, as if Eveline had a body to place. “If you vanish, we’ll both pretend it’s a nap. If you wake, I will kick you so you don’t become insufferable with your own nobility. In the morning we will write about rats because they have been acting like barons and the monkeys find them unfashionable.”

“In the morning,” Eveline said, because saying that made it so for a while. She went with her because you can go along without making footsteps if someone you love is making enough noise for both of you. In the passage, the portraits muttered the way old people do on benches when the sun is warm and the pigeons are a menace and the world is moving too fast and not fast enough. “She’ll ruin herself,” Great-Aunt said contentedly, as if it were a reflection of her own youth. “She’ll do it prettier.” The child with ink-stained fingers giggled and stuck her tongue out and made a blob on the corner of her own frame. The tall man who had cried in his bath looked as if he were listening to a song he had forgotten how to sing and was surprised how much his throat remembered.

Down in the kitchen that had remembered saucepans today and would forget them tomorrow, Aunty Geeta was already asleep with a goat’s head on each thigh, tied to sleep with a string of her own breath. Doctor Sen was graphing the angle at which a bell rope should be hung for the least offense to bats. Miss Havering had written a list of the worst exceptions and placed it under her cheek like a lover. The monkeys had arranged themselves on the rafters with the careful spacing of those who understand that being comfortable is a courtesy to the person next to you. The house settled and, remembering its own rule, wrote the names of those within itself down the inside of a wall in a small, private script that no one living would ever see. It wrote them in the order of their arrival and in reverse alphabet and in the shapes of their hands and in the number of times they had bitten their lips that day. It would forget in the morning how to read what it had written and would do it again at dusk and this was not a flaw. It was how it breathed.

In the small hours, when the city turns over and shows the side of itself that is all bruises and spoons, a rat as big as a handbag crept under the pantry door to see if the new rules had made tyrants of the crumbs. The crumbs had formed an association. They would only congregate under certain conditions; they had minutes and an agenda and were considering a motion about their relationship to mold. The rat, offended, stole a button and left in a huff to convene a confederacy. On the roof, the colobus shook her mane and blessed nothing. On the river, the tide turned under the viaduct where the sandbags lay askew and thought about swallowing a foot and letting go elsewhere and decided to be merciful once in a while does not kill a river.

Near dawn, a bell rang where no bell should have. It came from the statue of the municipal poet, the one whose stone cat had learned to squat with the seriousness of an old man urinating behind a hedge. The monkeys had given him a new hat made of a soup bowl. Someone, not quite someone and not quite no one, had hung a spoon from his raised cement hand and in the slight wind it chimed, a small, ridiculous music. The sound traveled through alleys and up staircases and along laundry and down gutters. It knocked at the door and did not ask to come in because sound knows no rules and that is both the problem and the salvation of the world. Eveline woke at it the way a tree wakes to light: old, slow, with a thrill it refuses to admit. She would write today, and be carved, and feed a city with rules not laws, water not wine, jokes not sermons. She would pay and be paid and forget and remember and be seen and not and be loved like a rumor. She laughed, quietly, so as not to wake the goats, and the house, pleased, laughed back, which sounds very much like a stair not creaking when it could.Morning found them like musicians remembering the chords with their fingers before their mouths could find the song. The house stretched into its own moldings and offered up the smell of dust and pepper and the faint sweet tang of old shellac, as if it had been thinking very hard in the night and was a little ashamed to tell them what about. Eveline woke to the spoon-bell chiming faintly along the bones of the city and kept her eyes closed a breath longer than was necessary in order to pretend that opening them was a choice. Mira’s breathing toward her shoulder had the calm of someone who had learned to siphon sleep in sips. Doctor Sen had already been up and down the stair twice without anyone hearing because accuracy is not the same as stealth and he had both. Aunty Geeta’s goats were the only ones who didn’t pretend sleep when woken by an ill-bred bell; they snorted, sneezed, and began chewing the empty air with the vigor of those who have never doubted breakfast will come.

By the time the first hands knocked at the door, the ritual had decided itself. The basin went by the threshold with a bar of soap the goats did not respect left deliberately to tempt them and cure them of it. A small bench had been dragged up from a corridor and declared permanent by the way three women had agreed to sit on it and make plans as if it had always been there to listen. The bell hung just inside the door where Aunty Geeta could give it the reprimands and compliments it deserved with the same rope. A scrap of board had been nailed at a respectful slant to a post for announcements and insults, and Miss Havering had written, with neat disapproval, the hours that were not to be argued with. At the top, the sign said the word Practice because Eveline had insisted and because the house had not objected, and below that, anyone who could write and anyone who could not but felt the right to try had added small amendments to the commandments. If you cannot say your name, it is agreed you may spit and count off your scars, and someone will say it for you. If you are not ready to curse, the goats will do it, but they will be offended and you’ll owe them a story later. If you bring bread, never apologize for it being stale, the house likes it that way.

The first woman in the queue was already halfway through laughing and crying at once. Her hands were cracked into maps and she scrubbed at them with the seriousness of someone excavating a fossil. She introduced herself as Tilda and then, under the breath of the door’s insistence, as Matilda Roan, and she made a face like a person trying on an old coat and finding it still fits around the shoulders. The next was a man who refused to say anything at all and then did, once the ash had bloomed obligingly against his palms, whispering Benedict as if he had found a small coin he had thought lost in the lining of a hated suit. A troop of macaques occupied the gutter like a jury reserving judgment and then, bored with anyone who took themselves too seriously, pelted the people with soft, thumped lemons that had gone sweet in their decline.

By the time the water had made its fourth little declaration of obedience to the new rule and Miss Havering had refused, firmly, to accept a half-bribe in the form of a slice of quince paste with the argument that it would only stick her teeth together when she needed them, the rats made their opening gambit. They arrived with all the pomp of men who believe their wealth ought to make their bodies invisible, and failed to be invisible by virtue of being rat-sized princes with shoulders like pebbles and eyes like good lacquer. One slipped sideways through the pantry door that had learned to stick out its tongue when teased, another vaulted the toe of a statue of Athena that had been demoted to doorstop and wore her demotion like a better job, and a third simply walked down the hall like he had received an invitation with seven seals and a footman. They circled the crate where bread had been stacked in neat, humble rows, and one of them climbed onto it with the grace of a man mounting a carriage, sat back on his haunches, and folded his small hands.

“Ah,” Aunty Geeta said, delighted in the same breath as annoyed, which made her voice full of welcome whether she wanted it to be or not. “The barons have sent a nephew.”

Mira set her bat’s bells to grumble rather than shout and moved to stand at the angle that meant both Here and Over My Dead Body. The goats stamped and then, in the way of goats, decided to look deeply uninterested while arranging to have all the advantages. Doctor Sen watched and did a little dance with his fingers that softened his left hand into something less like a trap, because rats do not trust men who catch things for a living and he had never quite forgiven himself for having done so for a while.

The foremost rat, whose whiskers had been singed at some recent justice and who carried himself like a man in a new suit pretending it was his second, blinked, considered the goats, discounted them with careful politeness, and addressed Eveline by looking at the pen. He placed on the crate, very deliberately, a pebble the exact size and color of a kidney bean and then, with the dignity of one trained to appreciate value, a dried plum, shriveled, glossy, perfect. He nudged them forward with his pads. Someone behind the crowd snorted and someone else, well-taught, smacked that person’s shoulder for laughing at an embassy.

“A tariff,” Miss Havering said, nearly approving despite herself. “Or tribute. It’s always the plum.”

“They will take the bread whether we accept the gift or not,” Mira said. “Let them make us elegant, at least.”

Eveline wanted to laugh and to bow and to lay down the pen like a queen writing a treaty with a very small empire and a great deal of nerve. She kept her face as polite as an open window. “You may have what the house does not want,” she said, and the house made a creak that was almost a sentence and almost reluctance. “You may have the crumbs that fall after the hands of the hungry have eaten with clean hands. You may have a corner to meet in where no one will stomp on you because they are frightened of their own shadows. You may not tax bread from mouths. We’ll write you an hour. You will keep to it. You will keep to walls and shadows and remember that goats have teeth.”

The rat on the crate inclined his small skull and his tail made a thoughtful glyph along the crust. He jumped down, examined the plum as if to make sure it had taken no offense, and then, with a little sigh that should have belonged to a widower with a good waistcoat, accepted the terms. He led his cousins through the crack with the silent, effortless pomp of those accustomed to doors that close in other faces. Aunty Geeta put the plum in her pocket and later, when no one was watching who would misunderstand, fed it in three neat bites to Mischief, who chewed them with the slow, ecstatic attention of one taught to enjoy what is not quite hers.

The river made itself known with the smell that men who live beside water learn to hear. Jessie Oates appeared with her hair wet again and her face telling the story before her mouth consented to the bother of words. The viaduct’s footings, under the echo tunnel, where children liked to run and shout to hear their voices multiply into a crowd that loved them, were weeping in earnest. The sand that had been stacked had slumped in the rain of rumors and the tide had chosen that moment to climb like a busy aunt. Men were arguing about whether prayer or wall would be better, which meant both would be made worse in the doing. Jessie stood barefoot under the sign and did not ask to come in because she wasn’t small and did not need permission and because this was the part where being insolent and being brave are indistinguishable.

“If we can move people,” she said, practical as knots, “if we say south cistern for washing only and take drinking elsewhere for the day, if we bring buckets and bottles and that tub that used to be a bottom of a silo, we can douse the mood as much as the water. My father will bring boys. The girls will bring the boys water and the boys will stop pretending to be important long enough to carry something heavy.”

“Bring them,” Miss Havering said, already sketching with her finger the geometry of who should stand where to make the most of the backs she had and to hide the lack of backs she did not. “We’ll write a path for the river the way we wrote a path for the city. We will ask like beggars and write like thieves.”

Eveline felt the pen stir under her hand as if the reed remembered the taste of marsh and silt and the first time it had seen itself plain in river-glass. She closed her eyes and smelled bookbinders’ glue and damp rope and the way the world had been when it had not been full of ash. “The house likes water that minds itself,” she murmured to no one who could do anything about it. “It hates to be damp the way an old lady hates children near her fireplace. We’ll have to write it a compliment.”

They went together because together was not something this city had done for a while, and doing it makes a taste in the mouth that is either iron or relief. The monkeys came in a wave along the roofs because trouble is their gossip and they prefer to see it for themselves. The path between the house and the viaduct had once been a street. It was now several plausible routes stitched by ropes, leaps, and the improvisatory artistry of people who have learned that gravity is as much about respect as it is about law. A boy ran ahead with a bell as if he had been born to be an omen and a girl with his face and not his eyes darted at his heels with a coil of bright hose that had once been a richness and was now an invitation to a dance.

At the viaduct, the leak was a thousand small decisions made by water doing what it does best: making a plan out of pressure and opportunity. The sound was a quarrel and a lullaby at once. Men with sand and men with a stubbornness that pretended to be sand moved in arguments. Monkeys had invented a game in which a pebble was tossed into the quick mouth of the leak and points were awarded for what no one agreed upon. A woman sat down and put her head in her hands not because she was tired but because deciding where to stand when new rules are being made is more exhausting than lifting a bag.

Mira stepped onto the slick and did not slip because slips are for when no one is watching. She pointed and men stopped pointing at one another and listened. Miss Havering walked the line where the old stones met the new and tapped with her knuckle and then with the heel of her hand and said under her breath the numbers of the distances between the gaps. Aunty Geeta tethered her goats to the memory of a bollard and borrowed two boys by saying Come hold this and waiting for their politeness to trap them until they were happy. Doctor Sen found a place where the noise changed color and nodded as if a beetle had just told him a scandal.

Eveline stood three steps back from the place where the water would want her ankles and lifted the pen. “We will write a liar,” she said, and the monkeys laughed because that was the sort of proposition they enjoy. “We will write that water can be poured the wrong way for an hour and it will believe us because we will make a map and then lie to the map and it will forget it is old enough to know better.”

“Ugly,” Miss Havering said, approving, and braced her palm against the stone as if it had a back she could support. “Make the lie kind to both of you.”

Eveline pressed the nib against the air above the seam where the viaduct’s footings kissed the echo tunnel. It was like writing on lantern smoke. The reed sang a little like a reed should when a girl on a riverbank invents for herself a song to make the world larger, and then it took a breath that belonged to the marsh it had once lived in and wrote a path. The line she drew in nothing looked like nothing and behaved like a sentence the river had always wanted to say. It curved where it ought and flattered stone into acting like it had chosen all along to be a gutter, not a wall. It whispered to the water the way a mother whispers to a toddler in a marketplace and the water, indulgent, rallied, turned, flowed itself into a new behavior with the superiority of the easily convinced. It slid along the line as if it had never intended to do otherwise.

The crowd of men who had been split between lifting and doubting did a small, involuntary sigh like people do when a trick of grammar makes sense after three readings. Jessie Oates whooped and clapped her hands together once, which in certain religious houses is a prayer. The monkeys, affronted at having their game removed, invented another in which they would now count how many times the men got their feet entirely wet when there was no call for it. A boy slipped on purpose and then, caught by Miss Havering’s glance, pretended to be ashamed and scrubbed the mud from a stone with unnecessary dedication.

Eveline felt it bite her at the wrist in a way that went clean through her and landed somewhere unhazardous and then decided to be tender enough to matter. A memory unhooked lightly, like an earring caught on a sweater. It was not one she would have chosen to keep if offered a catalog of her own mind. It was of a fringe curtain in a cheap restaurant that had served fish wrapped in paper printed with the news and the way the fringe had felt when she had brushed her hand through it to make herself visible to a boy who had already looked away. She gasped, not because she had lost anything precious, but because the sensation of something sliding out of the nest of her meant she was more hollow than before and she preferred not to know which hollows were which. The pen settled down as if it had been fed a small delicacy and accepted that for the moment.

The water acknowledged the trick by not pretending it had been beaten. It took the new path as an insult that could be cherished for an hour and repaid. The men, shamed into usefulness, stacked in the pace of a line that knows that if it stops it will not start again. The women who had thought of the children who would fall under the echo of the tunnel before anyone had given them permission to think of it pulled the children back by their shirt collars and then, because humanity is a beast of overcorrection, showed them how to watch without leaning as if that had been the lesson intended all along. Aunty Geeta, sitting on a coil of rope that had once held a ship by the throat and was now content to keep a goat from walking into history, nodded as if the goats had written the rule themselves. Miss Havering lifted her chin in the careless motion of a conductor who knows the orchestra is doing what she told them to. Mira looked at Eveline like a hand on the back of a neck, warm, ready to squeeze when necessary, ready to soothe when it would be ineffective and thus correct.

Solomon Oates came late and came without a flag and came like a man who had not decided whether to be angry or grateful and therefore chose the neutral of carrying something heavy, which is a language men learn as boys and forget when anyone writes a law on their behalf. He nodded to Eveline without seeing her and then, halfway through the nod, saw her without seeing her and swallowed an apology he did not yet know how to make. He carried sand until his shoulders made the promises his mouth would not. He shouted at Jessie to stand away from the edge until she stood nearer just to put the fear into him he deserved, and then, when he thought no one was watching, lifted her coat collar and shook the water from it like a man who had held a baby’s gown on a line long ago and not spoken of the tenderness of it to anyone since.

When the hour had passed and the river had disposed of the energy with which it had chosen to create that particular problem by making three more elsewhere that were less picturesque and therefore easier to ignore, they stood among the smell of wet stone and old iron and congratulated one another badly. It is a talent to accept gratitude; it is unnatural to perform it well when the work has been useful instead of gallant. Someone tried to start a song and failed and the monkeys, merciful, drowned it with a rattle of tin and thrilled cries. The house, across the quarter, sent a feeling along the ground like a cat pushing against a shin. It was so slight that only those who had learned to feel doors consider themselves sensed it, and they all turned toward home without deciding to.

On the way, Jessie fell into step with Mira and did not bother to lower her voice. “He will come at night,” she said, and Mira did not pretend she did not know who he was. “Not with cutters. With words. He’ll bring paper you have to recognize to keep not recognizing it forever, and a man who writes the way men write when they’ve borrowed their mother’s apron to knead a loaf. He will bring exceptions. He will bring the face he uses when he believes he is being fair.”

“Good,” Mira said, and she smiled in the way a cat smiles at a mouse who has brought along a fork out of politeness. “We have a woman who eats exceptions for supper and a goat who will sleep on his lap if he lies to us with a poem. We have a pen. We have no patience for fairness. We will give him water and a chair and then we will make him say his name like it is something he has not forgotten to wash.”

Back at the house, the rats had kept to their hour as if they had a calendar. They filed themselves along the baseboard and conducted a parliament that involved a great deal of whisker-grooming and arguing with their shoulders. One of them had found a bit of blue ribbon and wore it slung like a sash in a way that betrayed a fatal weakness for flattery. The goats had not eaten the soap again only because they had found the basket where hand towels lived and had decided to nibble the corners off the kindness. A note had been left on the step by a hand used to scrawling on walls; it said Bread Is Back Tomorrow Morn And If Anyone Laughs At It They’ll Wear It, which Miss Havering pinned to the board with a nod like a friend acknowledging another friend’s theft committed on their behalf.

In the Hall, the drawer had been generous again. It had disgorged a stack of leaves and bones and a fragment of a ledger that had been cut to the size of regret. The top leaf bore, in Eveline’s hand and some other time’s, a short treatise on rats, monkeys, and men. It made caveats that would have embarrassed a less arrogant writer into hiding. It said, plainly, that animals do not consent to being in your stories and will not abide by your rules unless incidentally. It said, equally plainly, that men will consent to being in your stories if they wrote them first. At the bottom, a sentence had been written as if with a knife: Do not write rats. Write crumbs. Do not write monkeys. Write roofs. Do not write men. Write what their hands touch and what they will not.

Miss Havering, reading over Eveline’s arm because the old woman had made a profession of reading over shoulders in rooms where she had not been invited, snorted. “You had sense at least once,” she said. “Let us try to invite her back in under the name of prudence. We will need it when he comes.”

“He,” Eveline repeated, because it steadied her to make a grammar with the danger. She had, once, liked men who arrived with paper and intentions. She had learned something since. She spun the pen in her fingers in a way that would have made a tutor slap her hand and felt two small memories unhook delicately like earrings deciding they were too heavy. They were both of bridges. One had been a kiss under one, one had been a lie told on top of one. She let them go without chasing them and put the pen down because gallantry is overrated as a means of convincing a tool you deserve it.

They made bread out of altar and argument, which is to say they made it badly and then better. The oven did not work because the house had never had a fondness for heat that was new to it, and then Miss Havering said its name sharply and it remembered being a thing that had fed children as well as lawsuits. A girl who had been a dishwasher in a restaurant that had never learned the trick of staying out of debt taught a boy who had been a thief how to punch dough and the two of them laughed as if inventing a private language. Mira cracked an egg with one hand and scowled when it went all over her palm and then licked it off because the new world has made manners into a luxury and she had paid for all of hers already. They opened the windows to offend the neighborhood and to court the monkeys, and both were delighted, though for different reasons. The smell of yeast woke two portraits from a sulk and made them hungry for gossip.

When the first loaf came out too hard and too pale, Aunty Geeta tapped it and declared it a judge. “Useless until you need a definition,” she said, and the goats bleated in agreement. When the second came out less arrogant, she nodded and put it under her chair with the possessiveness of someone who has practiced sharing enough for one life. When the third came out and the fourth, they sent them to the door and men who had not thought to be present now found themselves so and learned the taste of a thing that came from a room with rules wrote into its walls. It changed nothing and it changed everything. People say such sentences; they are often true and always insufficient.

Late afternoon made itself a hinge. The light outside the door turned skeptical and the house went alert along its lintel. The goats stood and shook their ears. The monkeys arranged themselves where they could see faces well enough to mock them later. Miss Havering spat lightly into her scarf and rubbed it along the edge of the table where papers collected, not because the table needed cleaning but because preparation is a kind of superstition that works more often than it should. Mira checked the bells and let them sing a little to bleed off mischief. Doctor Sen set the beetle case atop a book which he did not open and thought about how men hold their hands when they are about to lie and how to make them show their palms for the sake of water without making a theater of humiliation. Eveline breathed like a person and wished not to notice she had had to learn again how to do that.

He came as a deputation that pretended not to be one. There were two men with caps in their hands, which is a hat trick as old as any law. There was a woman with a notebook and a clean pencil and the expression of someone who has chosen to be underestimated. There was a boy with a watch that had stopped in the old world and that he wound with the dutiful faith of a son. There was a sheet of paper, folded, so exhaustively folded that it had convinced itself it had always been meant to be half as small, and it carried in its fibers the ambition to unfurl and trouble everything.

Solomon Oates sent a breath in ahead of them that said he had not been able to make peace between his pride and his sense. He entered and took off his hat and did not throw it, which was a compliment, and looked as if he had every intention of being rude in order not to be rude. “I’ve brought the Chair,” he said, very nearly smirking because he thought he was making a joke in some language that belonged to his enemies.

The woman with the notebook smiled, not at the joke but at the shape it made in the air. “Mrs. Chair,” she said dryly, and put the notebook down functioning as an introduction without asking permission of the room. “I’m Maris Rin. I write what men say when they mean to boast and what they don’t say when they mean to threaten. The Council sent me because they are tired of hearing themselves speak to one another. They imagine I am their translator. I am here to tell you they wish to assess whether your practice is a building or a meeting or a nuisance or a god. They would like you to accept classification. Before we begin, I will take water because I have earned it, and then I will wash my hands in it because this is a stubborn city and I enjoy offending it.” She held her hands forward with the casual courage of someone who likes to make the house speak and Mira, unexpectedly charmed, permitted her the basin and watched her curse with a fluency that put three useful new words into the day.

“We don’t answer to chairs,” Mira said, when the pleasantries had all been exhausted and then resurrected for the sake of making the room bearable. “We answer to goats. We answer to water. We answer to the house when she creaks. We answer, occasionally, to Doctor Sen when he makes that face as if we had picked the wrong pin for a pretty beetle. If you want classification, you can take it outside and pin it to the municipal poet’s chest.”

Maris Rin raised an eyebrow that had been trained in rooms where men did not believe their eyebrows could be read. “You answer to names,” she said, and glanced toward the door, which breathed back at her like a very old dog deciding whether to get up to fuss at a stranger. “And you answer to a pen. I can hear it. I can smell marsh when I shouldn’t. You won’t write my Council. Good. Don’t. It will make them puff up and burn themselves and I have a kitchenette in my head where I do not need the smell of that. But you will write something today, because that is what this place is for, and they will leave believing they have been understood. We will call you a commons. It will offend the house and that will be good for both of you.”

Miss Havering looked like someone had been invited who might yet be of use. “You eat exceptions for breakfast,” she said. “Sit at my end and help me keep goats from sleeping on the minutes.”

The paper on the table, unfolded at last like a lily that regretted blooming and lied about it, bore language that had been written with the voice of a man who had not washed his hands before picking up a pen and believed that was part of his charm. It was full of To wit and In the event and Whereas, and the words lay on it like tools placed back incorrectly in a drawer by a boy who means to burn down the shed anyway. The Council wanted access, oversight, auditing, relief from the obligation to say their names at the threshold, immunity for men who came through under arms to defend the public, and a right to levy a tithe on all water leaving the south cistern to support their important work in administering the river’s mood. In return they would write the house’s name into their paper and bless it with recognition.

The house rippled along the crown molding and sneezed, which made a portrait set crooked in a way that improved it. The monkeys, listening, made the clucking sound of old women knitting a story from someone else’s wool. The goats scooted closer to the table until their noses nearly touched the edge of the paper and then stopped and breathed on the clauses in a way that fogged the ink.

Eveline could have written the refusal in a single stroke and had it be real. She could have made the pen snort and sneeze the paper into ash. She could have written a rule that anyone bringing a list would leave with none of it intact and be made to carry their own shredded expectations home in a basket made of their pride. She could have written the river into their mouth so they would be drowned in their own speech. She set her hand on the pen and did nothing. She looked at Maris Rin and at Solomon Oates who was pretending to be tall and at the boy with the dead watch who had not been asked his name by anyone with power in a long time. She looked at the goats and the monkeys and Mira and Miss Havering and Doctor Sen and the house and the little invisible ledger it had scratched on the inside of its own wall at dawn and decided not to make magic because she hated the taste of it in this context and because power given to a woman under a man’s stare can be as poisonous as written salt.

Miss Havering tapped the paper twice, pinning the top clause and the bottom one with one hand like a cardsharp making a point about how games ought to be played. “No,” she said, and the refusal went through the room like a nail through wood, clean, no splintering. “We will not be overseen. You will not levy a tithe. You will not bring arms into a place where water is poured and pretend to keep everyone safe by frightening them into being small. You will not name us. We will name ourselves. Here is what you may do. You may bring wood for winter and leave it without ceremony. You may permit your men to say their names here without losing face when your boys in hats yatter about law. You may send a woman to ring this bell when flood threatens and we will come and we will write in the air and you will credit your own handsome forearms with the strength. You may tell people that you are generous and we will not correct you. You may accept that we will correct you on other matters and that the correction will be delicious.”

Maris Rin grinned, catlike and unstartled. “You should have been our Chair,” she said, almost regretful. “You will be called witch on the way home.”

Mira looked at Solomon and raised an eyebrow that still had blood dried in it from some day years ago. “Are you a man with a river and a girl with a bell,” she said. “Or are you another piece of paper trying to get rain drunk on compliments.”

He looked tired the way fathers look tired in fairy tales when they have done something unforgivable and do not know how to reverse logic to make themselves innocent. “We can’t stop anyone from coming,” he said. “Even ourselves. The river will bring them and their thirst will bring them and your rumors will bring them. The Council will write a new word if you refuse the old one and claim you with it. They will say this place is essential services and ring the poet’s spoon until the monkeys are deaf. I came to say that if you give me a sentence I can take back that is true and not embarrassing, I can make the threatened men feel less small and more useful. That will save you from having to write too much tonight.” He swallowed and held the language out like a rope made of something other than hemp or silk. “Please.”

Eveline loved him for the please as she would love a good chair for taking her weight without creaking at the wrong time. She picked up the pen and decided to write as if the reed had come from their river and not another and as if the marsh had been a neighbor and not a grandparent. “I write,” she said, and the monkeys settled into a kind of respectful vandalism with their ears, fake innocent, real interest, “that no arm shall be bared under this roof that is not baring itself for labor or for healing. I write that any man who comes in here in his role shall speak his name twice, once for work and once for his grandmother, and that if he speaks the second with a lie in it the goats will follow him home. I write that the bell is to be rung by any who need the river to listen and that answering it is not charity but handsome behavior. I write that anyone who brings wood and leaves it without making a speech will find bread in their hand as if by accident. I write that paper left here with the intent to bind shall confetti itself. I write that paper left here with the intent to tell shall keep.”

The reed left a taste in her teeth like green. It pulled with its neat little hunger and she let it have a trinket: the feel of a wool glove turned inside out to dry on a register in a house that had had noisy heat and had not appreciated it. Miss Havering smiled like someone handed a gift that had been wrapped in familiar shame. Maris Rin’s pencil, for once, did not write. She put it behind her ear and laughed the small, merciless laugh of someone who knows better than all her friends and is relieved to find someone who also does. Solomon Oates flinched at the word grandmother in a way that told the room more than any confession would have, and Mira, being a good friend in the way that means you will never let anyone sit down under the weight of their own love without mocking them into cheer, clapped him on the shoulder with a palm that would leave a handprint on a man’s better shirt.

Paper confettied. It did not burst; that would have been rude. It let go of its importance like a dignified aunt putting away a brooch after dinner and split into clean, narrow strips that fell on the table like a light snow and delighted the monkeys into not stealing anything else for three breaths. Maris gathered a handful and slid them into her notebook between a story about a ferry that had learned to sigh and a sketch of a new sign for a market that had decided to be a church on Thursdays. She tucked her notebook into her shirt as if it were not a weapon and looked at Eveline in a way that was almost curiosity and almost hunger. “What do you pay,” she asked lightly, and the room pretended not to be listening on purpose and failed.

“Nothing we can count,” Eveline said cheerfully, because if you make your ruin a joke you can take the teeth out of someone else’s bite. “Pieces. I lose little tricks that make bigger tricks easy. I lose the taste of seconds of my mother’s kitchen. I lose the curve of a boy’s ear and gain the angle of a road. It is arithmetic done by a woman in an old house with a new pen, and it is none of your business and all of yours.” She tilted the pen toward Maris. “I expect you pay, too. With the way men forget that listening is a skill and not a tendency.”

“I pay with my own jokes,” Maris said, and touched the pencil at her ear as if it were a small, hungry beast. “I used to be very funny. Now I am useful. It is a loss and an improvement. We do this when we are not bored.”

They sealed nothing because writing the word seal had started a war once and they had not time to pick a new term that would not steal their own blood. They ate bread and made the men drink water while speaking their grandmothers’ names and found that no man spoke a grandmother’s name the same way twice and that every woman went taller for hearing it, as if an agreement had been signed under their feet. The goats sniffed everyone like customs officers with a taste for scandal. The monkeys discovered that paper confetti is a dress and went to promenade before the poet with soup-bowl hat to see if he would applaud. The house, having permitted itself a laugh at the sight of officials trying to fold what would not be folded into their pockets, recorded along its plaster the shape of the speech that had not been made and never would.

Evening came in as it had always done, with confidence and incorrect makeup. People went away and promised themselves to come again when they were thirsty and polite. The last of the light made a stripe on the floor that had not been there yesterday and would not be tomorrow, and Aunty Geeta declared it a nice place to consider vengeance. Miss Havering made a list of the youngest boys who had looked an old woman in the eye and had been willing to say their names without being asked twice and filed them under Hope because putting anything else under that header felt like theft. Doctor Sen found himself in love with the sound of water in a basin when the person washing is cursing someone they admire.

When finally even the monkeys had decided the best place to be was a roof and not a threshold, Eveline went to the Hall and woke the letters for a breath and let them resettle, because being gentle with a tool is also a way of asking it not to be hungry for you. The drawer had not offered her a leaf this time. It had left, neatly pinned with a hairpin that might have been hers and might have bitten her once when she had done something cruel to it with her teeth, a short list written in the old script of the house. It was not her hand. It was the stiff, elegant hand of a woman who had died of having everything and of nothing in particular. It said, in lines that pretended to be immortal and were not, that if you mean not to be a queen you must learn to be corrected in public without making the correction a story about your pain. It said that the pen has two faces and one of them will tell you that you can make mercy for free. It said that at dawn a man with pockets full of dead spiders will come to ask for a rule about luck and you must tell him no.

She laughed, not kindly, because the writing had always wanted to be prophecy and it’s a disease worse than consumption. She decided to obey it anyway because a woman who cannot be corrected, even by ghosts she despises, should not be allowed to hold anything sharp. She put the hairpin into her hair without asking it for permission and went to find Mira because going to find Mira was the habit that would save her the longest.

She found her where she had expected, seated on the second stair with her back to the wall and her knee pressed against the banister, holding the bat as if it were a friend who had had too much and needed to be reminded where home was. Mira’s face had the open, dangerous softness it gets when she is bracing for something gentle. She patted the stair beside her, a sensible gesture that would never know the satisfaction of a palm finding a warm shoulder, and Eveline took it because you take what you can shame the world into offering you.

“I am going to be insufferable,” Eveline said, smiling so that the words would be a pleasant lie and a warning. “Remind me in the morning.”

“In the morning,” Mira said, and yawned in two syllables and a curse. “We write about rats. Or we don’t. We write about bread rising when someone kisses the pan. We write that anyone who whistles in the hall must be kissed or bitten. We write that men with pockets full of dead spiders can keep walking.” She scrunched her nose. “You smell like river.”

“I cheated it,” Eveline said. “It will cheat me back in a week and call it equilibrium.”

“Then we will count and call the number handsome and ban it for a day,” Mira said, and the house, pleased to have learned the trick of making a joke about accounting without offending Miss Havering, creaked in what could generously be called laughter. They sat a while and let the stairs stop noticing them. They would sleep, and be woken by the poet’s spoon and the goats’ complaints and a monkey’s invention of a new way to sharpen a stolen nail, and then the man with the spiders would come, and the rules would grow, and the pen would be light as air and heavy as a hand on the back of a neck, and the world would demand not queens, not saints, but people who knew how to wash, to curse, to count, and to tell a joke with their fingers wet.Morning tried to behave itself and failed in small, forgiving ways. The spoon-bell sang down the lane with the self-importance of a utensil invited to a wedding, and the house yawned into its joints as if waking had been a job it had held too long. Mira set the basin by the threshold as if it were a cornerstone and thumped the soap onto the ledge with an expression that implied any hand that did not respect it would be eaten. Miss Havering re-wrote the word Practice on the board with a thicker line as if making the letters fat might dissuade men from trying to live inside them. Aunty Geeta shook oats into a pail for the goats with a generosity that would have embarrassed a banker and smacked Mischief’s nose when she tried to put her head into the bag as a matter of principle. Doctor Sen hung the bell with the rope at what he called the least-offensive angle and everyone else called fine. The monkeys announced the weather in a dialect composed entirely of comparative adjectives and the crackle of stolen cellophane, and two small boys arrived, solemn, to paste eyes on the kitchen window with glue made of old rice and promises.

Before the hour had gotten its teeth into the day, the man with the spiders came, punctual as a curse. He was not what anyone wanted him to be, which would have been either pitiable enough to make refusal a kindness or arrogant enough to make refusal a pleasure. He wore a jacket that had never belonged to him and had forgiven him that fact, and his pockets bulged in a way that suggested coins until he moved and the shape of the bulge seethed, fine as pepper. The smell that came off him was pantries, camphor, and the frail sweetness of things that used to be alive and had chosen not to take offense at their own ending. When he tilted his head, something in his hair shone like thread and then vanished. He took off his cap as if introducing himself to a grave.

“They’re dead,” he said at once, as if he had known what they would think and had decided to pluck that particular thorn before anyone cut themselves. “I collect them from corners. I don’t kill them. I take what’s left after everyone else has forgotten to be frightened. I keep them in paper and I make them into luck.” He patted his breast, which made a silty sound, and the goats recoiled with that special disdain goats have for men who believe dead things can be compelled into duty. “I can pay, with what I have, for you to write a rule,” he said, and his eyes did not climb the door the way some poor men’s eyes do when faced with a tall thing; they went sideways, like spiders do, as if to watch for exits. “I want you to fix chance. Not for me only. For a quarter. For a way of living.”

Miss Havering did not bother to hide her interest, because people who pretend not to be fascinated by new forms of stubbornness are cowards twice over. “Fix it how,” she said, precisely, the way a tailor pinches a sleeve to see where the cloth will be insulted into falling right. “You want your dice to lie for your children? You want the cards to choose you because you have a good smile and a bad history? Or do you want something uglier: that bad men lose in a way they can understand?”

He smiled then, a small, tired thing that told the room he had not slept inside a door for a decade and had convinced himself he preferred it. “I want to stop burying the ones who never learned to cheat right,” he said, and that was honest enough that the monkeys all stopped pretending not to listen and leaned forward together, a furry tide. “I want a rule that luck can’t leave our span of river without leaving like-for-like. If a man wins more than three days running, he must drop a handful of his good into a jar on his way home and that jar will find a mouth like water does. If a woman loses twice, her third must come sweet. I want us to stop believing the river hates us. I want a way to say we are not being punished, we are merely being counted wrong. I have spiders. They catch what falls through holes in attention. They are a net.” He opened his palm and let them see a paper twist. Inside lay husks that were nearly nothing, precise as hunger. “I brought you luck,” he finished, and said it with zero irony and too much hope.

The house, which had made it clear that prophecy fatigued it, exhaled a long, papery breath from somewhere in the molding. In the Hall, inside a drawer that would not be opened until later, the hairpin that had pinned last night’s instruction rolled an eighth of an inch like a throat clearing. Mira looked at Eveline in the way someone looks across a bridge they love in a wind that wants it. Aunty Geeta tugged Hearsay’s lead twice, because the goat had begun to taste the air with the offended curiosity of an aunt in a confessional. Doctor Sen put his thumb against the crease of the man’s paper twist and did not pry it, which is the kind of restraint that makes good men live longer. Miss Havering set her knuckles on the table and made a small, decisive sound like a door that knows which side of itself is private.

“No,” Eveline said, with all the gentleness she could find in the pantry of her mouth. She did not leave the word there to be starved by brevity; she fed it reasons. “I will not write a rule about luck. I won’t because it’s not a thing. It is the name we gave to the sum of all the causes we didn’t bother to count. If I write it, I will be lying, and a lie written with a pen like this molds in walls. You don’t want your babies breathing that for a decade. I won’t because the price will be paid by the wrong people; the ones who try to keep their hands clean will have their fingers burned down to cleverness and call it justice. I won’t because I’m vain, and I cannot stand the song in my head of us thinking we made weather with grammar. If you want us to stop burying the ones who never learned to cheat, we can write about stakes, not outcomes. We can write about what cannot be wagered. We can write about which parts of a life are not to be risked because there’s no morality points for losing them.”

The man’s mouth pulled itself flat, which in some men is the moment before anger and in others, the moment after understanding. He ran a thumb over the edge of the twist of paper and then tucked it back into his breast with the care of a man who knows better than to show a sacred thing to a room full of people who will make a story out of it. “You’ll write that we cannot play for bread,” he said slowly, not as a question so much as a rehearsal for a new rule he might be expected to recite without sounding like a schoolboy. “You’ll write that we cannot play for beds. You’ll write that no one can take a tool from a hand at the turn of a card.”

“We’ll write that,” Miss Havering said crisply, because being obeyed is the only sacrament she respects. “And more. We’ll write that lots are for burdens. We will write that when it is time to carry the corpse or stand the night at the door with a stick or climb down into the echo tunnel when the river is whispering, that is when chance may be consulted. We will write that joy is distributed by need and work by lot and that anyone who says otherwise in this house will put their hand out for the ash as penance for a tidy thought.”

“Ugly,” Mira said, which in the current economy was a benediction. “And no games in sight of water. It gets jealous. It’ll take it from you while you laugh.”

Eveline lifted the pen and the reed hummed in her skin the way marsh reeds do in the wrong wind and she did not let it make the word luck even in her head. She wrote on the air a rule shaped like a shelf and laid upon it prohibitions that would bear the weight of poverty without cracking into scorn. She wrote that bread is not a stake and beds are not a stake and names are not a stake and the pen is not a stake and goats are not a stake, and the goats, listening, flicked their ears and decided to forgive everyone for once. She wrote that lots are permitted for burdens, not gifts, and that the lot will not fall twice on the same shoulder until everyone’s shirt has been washed in the same water. She felt the pen nibble at her and gave it pennies: the exact sound of her father folding a newspaper on a Sunday; the face of a girl she had forgotten hating in a way she no longer had time for. The house accepted the shape of the words the way a kitchen accepts a new hook; the monkeys looked disappointed and then invented a game with lemons that punished greed with stickiness.

The man with the spiders listened as if someone were telling him a childhood he might have liked. He nodded at the part about burdens with the special, grim appreciation of someone who has lifted wrong too often. He did not argue. That was, perhaps, the gift he had brought. Instead he asked for water like a poor man being polite about the weather, washed his hands with thoroughness that made the ash change its mind and hide, and dragged his palms dry on his jacket with the elegance of a courtier. He put a very small thing on the table, barely a scrap, not a bribe, an offering: a bit of web, knotted into a square, with a seed caught in it. “A nave,” he said, because some men call that square a dream and others a net and he was a man who went to church in a way that stuck. “For your window. Not to keep anything out. To remind you what you kept.”

“Keep your dead,” Aunty Geeta said with the ruthless kindness she saves for men who bring their own quiet. “Feed them something sweet sometimes or they’ll misbehave. Don’t hang them over your bed. Hang them near your door. Let them listen when you come home, so they remember your voice and don’t hold you by your coat when you need to leave.”

He laughed, surprising himself, and it was a good sound and deserved to be heard more often than it had been. He left with his pockets full of what he loved and not what he’d hoped to buy, and the house wrote his name along its inner wall without asking the spelling because it had learned that some men’s names want to be a little incorrect in order to be true.

They wrote the rats next because putting off a parliament only makes its minutes longer. Miss Havering held the pen as if it were a knitting needle someone had dared her to use for crochet and dictated, dry and certain, and Eveline wrote because sometimes a woman should be used as a hand. Rat Hour, the new sign said in small, tidy loops, is at dusk and just after bread. Crumbs belong to the floor for that hour and the walls may not squeal. No sticky traps within a span of the door. No rat shall cross between feet. Anyone caught squealing outside Rat Hour will be made to hold goats through a rainstorm. Anyone caught laying poison will have their own pockets filled with spitballs rolled by children with clean hands. The goats approved by climbing onto the bench and thumping it with hooves in a way that could only be read as applause by people already inclined to believe goats democratic. The rats sent an emissary wearing a ribbon that was absolutely stolen from somebody’s hair in 1998 and bowed at the posted paper with a civility that startled the house into forgiving a hundred small insolences.

The whistling made itself policy by accident. A boy whistled in line without malice and three girls hissed In a kitchen, are you mad and he laughed and whistled twice to prove he was. The house’s draft went down a back and somebody said you owe us a kiss and the goats bleated an opinion that could have been either vulgarity or abstinence. Miss Havering, who hates entropy in any register but humor, rolled her eyes and wrote it down without looking: Whistle under a roof and pay in affection, or be bitten gently by someone with good teeth, your choice. Consent implied by the whistling. No biting anyone who looks like they’ve had enough for today unless they laugh first. The monkeys clapped until one fell off a gutter and hung by his tail and then clapped again upside-down, because nothing pleases monkeys more than Performative Decency.

A quarrel arrived at midday with all the theater it could afford. Two women who had a right to disdain one another’s sleeves because both had washed too many of other people’s and too few of their own, slapped each other’s language in front of the basin until Miss Havering rang the bell twice in a tone that meant if they wanted a stage she’d provide a better one. Mira pulled a chalked circle onto the floor with the toe of her boot, ugly and precise, because chalk is for children and war both and this seemed the day for mixing their economies. The rule about fights had been written under Eveline’s breath last evening and now revealed itself like a well-made hem: No blood under the door. Two witnesses for any quarrel and a third witness to say when it’s comedy and when it’s cruelty. If after ten minutes you can’t decide which it is, it’s neither and you have to sit back-to-back and tell each other the worst thing you ever cooked until one of you laughs. The women sat, shoulders touching, and the room went patient in that way domestic spaces can when they have seen it all and remember the outcomes. They traded recipes with significance, and when one of them confessed to having put sugar instead of salt in a pot of beans and serving it anyway because the man at the table had deserved a small, polite, culinary vengeance, the other laughed and put her forehead to the first’s shoulder and the circle abolished itself. This is what law used to look like when it wasn’t wearing metals.

In the afternoon, Maris Rin came back with a blister where her pencil had bitten her ear, and sat with one hip on the table in the posture of a woman who has learned to make a performance of casualness because men are so susceptible to it that it becomes a tool. “They’ve settled on calling you the commons,” she said, and rolled her eyes because the word had already been used as a cudgel twice that day and once as a prayer. “Fine. They are going to put up a sign on their end of the quarter that says Respect Our Commons and it’s going to be a threat, and they’re going to pretend not to hear that. I’ve written a notice of my own; it says Bring Your Cup and Mind Your Mouth and I’ve pasted it over their notice twice and each time a boy with respectable hair has peeled it off and carried it home to paste above his bed. We are winning in small, disgusting ways.”

“Jessie said they’d come with paper and names,” Mira said, slicing bread with unnecessary ferocity as if to remind the loaf of what genre of labor it belonged to. “They came. We confettied them. Do you need any more sport from us, Maris Rin, or did you come to practice scorn because you’re out of men today.”

Maris poured herself a drink and put the cup down without drinking because self-denial is her most attractive trick. “I came to ask you if you’ll send girls to the river to learn to ring the flood bell,” she said, humor falling out of her hands like coins because she did not need it for this. “My old men with whistles can’t get out of their own way and if I stand there any longer saying Do you not want to live, I will begin to bite and then there will be a plague. I want the girls who rang your bell when the boy fell in. I want the ones who already know that a bell is both announcement and command. We’ll trade you rope. We found a coil that still remembers being a live thing and wants work.”

Miss Havering nodded and began to scribble names in the angle of the table where the grain had decided to be a little too romantic and therefore needed occupying. Aunty Geeta volunteered one of the goats on behalf of the goats to stand near and butt anyone who tried to say the bell was a man’s work. The house approved and sent a cool draft down the hall that smelled like rain making up its mind to be obedient. Jessie appeared at the end of the day with wet hair and a ribbon around her wrist that once said NO FEES and now said louder NO FEES. She collected three girls and a boy who refused to stay behind, and Miss Havering pinned each of their sleeves as if to the moment.

The rats kept to their hour. The goats slept standing and dreamed of salt. The monkeys invented a new game called hold-still-while-I-steal-and-groom-your-dignity and it had very few rules and many participants. The house practiced the trick where it remembered that its stairs could choose not to creak and did so at moments when two people were doing the difficult work of pretending not to be moving toward one another. The poet with the soup-bowl hat acquired a scarf in the night and some chalked verse on his shin that made the monkeys blush and the old women laugh and the children squint in the universal child-language for I will ask someone later, either for the meaning or for a candy.

Near dark, the drawer in the Hall gave up another handful of what had been saved for exactly this day and no other. A ledger edge, brittle, with numbers stopped midway as if interrupted by a war. A ribbon that had been blue under gaslight and now was tired. A note in a hand that belonged to someone who had owned too many dresses: If you must bind yourself, do it in a voice that isn’t yours. Doctor Sen, upon reading it aloud, did not even try to pretend disapproval. “We can write you ugly,” he said to Eveline almost gleefully, because men who love systems delight in finding a way for love to be an equation. “That sentence I proposed. We’ll make it worse. Miss Havering can sand it until it hurts. We’ll give you a tether that is a bureaucrat instead of a poem. The pen will despise it and obey it. That will keep you where we can scold you into eating.”

Mira bristled on principle and because the idea had a flavor of putting a collar on a god, and she had never liked deities or jewelry except the kind that comes off with your shoes. “We’re not going to teach the house to pull on her leash when Eveline wanders,” she said, but the refusal was not the carved thing it should have been; it lay soft and workable in the middle like dough. “If we write it, we write it so it binds her to us and not to her own nobility. It binds her to my mouth when I curse her for heroics. It binds her to your beetles when you tap a code, Doctor. It binds her to the goat’s bell when Aunty Geeta shakes a grain scoop. It binds her to Miss Havering’s disapproval. We do not tie her to her own name. Names are so easily stolen.”

“It is ugly,” Miss Havering said, almost with love, as she sketched the phrases the way a surgeon sketches a cut she hates but knows will save an idiot. “She who is neither enumerated among the dead nor listed among the living; she who is not reckonable by tax nor by tithe; she who does not answer to summons but to the voices she has chosen before and the ones she instructs afterward; she who refuses a crown; she who keeps this door. Present when called by these and absent when called by paper. Absent when called by fear. Absent when called by her own vanity. Present when called by hunger, by laughter, by flood, by goats, by a boy who forgot and needs reminding, by a girl who will not ask twice.”

The pen did not like it. You could feel its dislike in the lift of the hairs along your arm the way you feel resentment in a cat who deigns to stay in your lap when you’ve decided to get up. Eveline picked the reed up and it bucked only once, proving its point, and then settled because good tools appreciate ugliness that prevents pretty disasters. She wrote the tether in the air and onto the wood and into the breath of the room and the house made a long, complicated complaint in the language of structures that is half settling and half gossip. It took something from her, a biggish thing by its own measure and a small-ish thing by hers, and she let it go without showing anyone what they did not have a right to see. It was, she realized a minute later when a boy began to whistle and then stopped shy of laughter, the knowledge of whether she likes whistling. She smiled and decided that was as good a price as any. She could be taught again. She could be made to love it by force of habit or annoyance or Mira’s mouth when it said stop in the same breath as please.

Shortly after, a man arrived with his pockets full of dead spiders because prophecy enjoys mocking its own accuracy. He had a mouth like a paper cut and the patience of a drawer. He slapped the twist down on the table and demanded luck with the entitlement of someone who had never been told no nicely and had therefore developed a taste for being refused rudely. They told him no, and his face did the math badly and the goats sighed and wandered off because they had no sympathy left for men who thought dead things were debt that could be collected. A monkey lifted the twist as if it were a napkin at a banquet and took from it two husks and wove them into his own eyebrow and became beautiful in a way only his wife would ever understand. The man left and would come back, or would not, and either way the rule was written and the house would not be learning the taste of luck as if it were salt.

Toward the end of the day, Jessie returned with a grin that indicated someone had threatened to throw her in the river and been thrown into a puddle instead. “The bell girls rang until the old men cried,” she announced, not triumphantly; factually, as the weather. “We’ve got a knot that holds even when the rope thinks it would prefer not to. I made my father say his grandmother’s name out loud in front of ten men and a goat, and he did, and he didn’t break, and four of them did the same, and I would like to sleep in your hall because the one at home is too echoey with all the unsaid names bouncing like birds.”

“Sleep under the portraits,” Mira said, as if offering someone the loan of a weather system. “Make them look at you. They’re vain and they need projects, those dead. If one of them tells you to marry a man with a pen, spit on the frame and we will applaud you in the morning.” Jessie saluted as if this were a military instruction and one of the painted children stuck out her tongue in approval.

Night’s first draft came whistling up the alley with its shirt untucked and surprised everyone only because everyone had mouthed a small private prayer that the day would agree to last a little longer. The line dwindled. The basin had the right scum in it and that meant it had been useful. The rat parliament dismissed itself with a decorous whisker-salute that meant See you at crumbs. The goats were tied with the knot that wasn’t a knot and lay down as if the floor had spoken to their knees. The monkeys took their places in the cheap seats of a theater none of them paid for because they were investors in the general comedy. The house wrote, inwardly, that the man with the spiders who had been refused with kindness had forehead lines that spelled out the number seven if you looked at him sideways and it would check in a week to make sure that had become a laugh and not a scar.

They would have slept as people newly married to a complicated endeavor sleep: with one hand in the work whether or not that hand is made of flesh. Instead the city invented a new noise, because that is the function of cities. It was a wire singing. It was the sound that makes goats lift their heads and men put their hand to their pocket to ensure that the only thing inside is money owed and not money owed to them by someone they will never see again. It came from the roof and the alley and the gutter and the statue of the poet and some other, more private place which, upon examination, turned out to be the leftmost pocket of Doctor Sen’s coat. He took out the small case of beetles with exaggerated patience, opened it, and heard the wire sound come from elsewhere anyway. The monkeys went still. The house drew itself up into the height older people take on when someone younger is about to try something stupid. Eveline reached for the pen and did not take it up and Mira did not reach for the bat and then did, and Miss Havering set down her pencil as if someone had just invented a new kind of lie and she had been selected by the gods to be the first to cut it into parts.

Along the cornice, a thin line had been drawn by someone with hands careful enough to be a midwife and cruel enough to be a rope. It moved like a string under a violin. It carried with it the smell of tooling and habit and hunger disguised as engineering. At the end of the street, men with faces that had never learned how to be comfortable even with an advantage leaned against shadows and tried to look like their own luck. Wire and words had come to try their temper against ink and goats and women with bellies full of insolence. The house remembered a fire that had been un-invented a decade ago by grief and stubbornness and took a breath that would require a rescue. Eveline smiled at the wire the way a woman smiles at a cat she knows full well is going to jump onto a table that’s all glass and teeth and declared in a voice fit for a toast at an impolite wedding, “If anyone whistles, they’ll be kissed or bitten,” because courage is made bearable by jokes and because rules, once written, long to be tested like new shoes long to be walked in rain.

They went to the door together as if it were an altar and a stage and a mouth. They opened it just enough to make anyone on the other side choose whether to be polite or to be embarrassed by wanting to put his face in a gap. They stood and the house stood with them and the spoon on the poet’s hand chimed in a wind that had taken up the tricks of ambition and they waited to see whether this would be a story about wires or about men and whether, for once, it could be about neither, and about what happens when a city remembers that a commons is only a room with a door and a basin and a laugh, until it isn’t.
