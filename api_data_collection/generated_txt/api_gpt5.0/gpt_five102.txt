The river ran green that morning, a dusky bottle-glass ribbon cutting through rows of corn and cracked highways and the square where the courthouse held its white pillars like teeth. It was not a remarkable river—it smelled like algae and motor oil after rain—but it had a way of catching whatever light fell across Springfield, as if it were the kingdom’s sole mirror. That was fitting, the priests had said, because Springfield had always had difficulty seeing itself.

Elowen rubbed at the cold spot on her palm where a ring should be and wasn’t. She had lost the ring months ago and had dreams about finding it, always in the same place: inside the mouth of the clock at the top of the library, in the space where the hour hand would click and judder and then, without warning, skip from two to six. In the dreams she reached in, cut her wrist on the thin metal, and drew it out with blood dripping from the band like a ribbon that couldn’t decide which side of the iron it wanted to live on.

“The corn’s burned,” said Jonah, pointing a freckled finger at the far field. “There wasn’t even weather. Not like we had last year.”

“The weather is a rumor that takes itself literally,” Elowen replied, distracted. She had come to the river to be the kind of person who could watch things pass and not want to follow them. Princesses had tutors to teach them the official names for such disciplines—equanimity, restraint—but in Springfield people liked their virtues bawled into being by thunderheads. “Anyway, you’re crude, you know. Speaking of my kingdom’s crops like they’re nothing.”

“Your kingdom,” Jonah echoed, and then smiled with teeth too big for his mouth. “Your kingdom doesn’t even obey your traffic lights. I almost got hit twice coming up Main.”

He was not a knight and never would be; he stood like trouble standing still. But everyone called him Sir Jonah in the way that Springfield called Elowen Princess—half-dare, half-promise. He had no father anyone could point to with confidence. He had never left because he loved this place with a love so stubborn it looked like a broken car that still turned over every morning.

Elowen dipped her finger into the river. The ring had left a groove like an old channel. A fish licked at her skin with blunt, soft ignorance, and for a moment she imagined she could slide through that surface—glass, and then other side—and find herself in a quieter water.

“There’s word from the coasts.” Jonah kicked at a soda can until it leapt into the current and spun. “They’re saying she—this other one—has been seen.”

“She is not a creature like deer at the edge of things,” Elowen said. And then, unable to help herself: “Where?”

“West,” he said finally. “Firestorms wandering like dogs. Something about a girl with a crown of storm glass that makes smoke taste like rain. My mother thinks they’re just stories with someone’s face pressed into them, and the face is the one they want to stone.”

“You said she was a princess.”

“That’s what they call her on the radio. Some preacher from the coast said it first, and people liked the sound. The Princess of… ruin? Woe? Death? You can never tell what they’re paying for when they tithe to a story.”

Elowen wiped her wet hand on the skirt of her dress and watched the mark disappear. “There’s only one princess,” she said. “And I don’t like being made plural.”

“You do that on your own,” Jonah answered, and then flinched as the courthouse bell struck nine by itself, three times, though it was hardly a respectable hour for noon. It had been doing that—three strokes wrong, and then smaller metallic clicks like a watch that had learned to cough. They said the bell had a crack so hair-thin that it didn’t show in pictures.

Elowen tried not to look at the clock-face. She had already been awake for hours, had already written her name on a napkin at the diner in four different hands, had already rubbed it into smears and watched people pretend not to see. They saw, of course. Everyone in Springfield was neighbor and audience and judge and the same soft thing behind the eyes. When your princess couldn’t spell her name the same way twice before coffee, you faced your eggs over easy and called it weather.

She was supposed to go to the luncheon. The Regent had made the request as if it were both a favor and a summons. Aunt Magdalena liked to sweeten her knives.

“I’ll walk you to the square,” Jonah said, and took the long way, through the alleys where kudzu climbed the back sides of stores and you could hear the county fair like a pulse. Elowen pretended not to see the posters pasted to the municipal walls—the posters said PRINCESS OF SPRINGFIELD in letters that started out regal and then went tired, like a teacher’s chalk hand near the end of schooling. There were faces, too. A little girl with a gap-toothed smile and a blue ribbon pinned to her hair; a boy in a band uniform; a man whose grief had collapsed his nose like it was too soft to carry its own past. Missing.

Someone had scratched a crown over each of their faces. Someone else had crossed the crowns out.

“That’s cruel,” Elowen said. The taste in her mouth went metallic, the way it did when she brushed against the part of herself that knew where the ring was and wouldn’t tell. “Whoever did that—”

“People do things they don’t mean when they’re afraid.” Jonah did not look at her. “And people are afraid. They think a story will pick them off first if they don’t preemptively shoot it.”

She pushed the courthouse door, and the heavy wood swung open with a sigh like old grain bending. Inside, the ceiling paints had peeled so cleanly that the angels looked like they were sticking their heads out of bathwater. Aunt Magdalena stood in the center of it all, the light falling so precisely on her silvered hair that Elowen, with a pang that was not envy but something more grotesque and familial, thought someone had installed a halo when she wasn’t looking.

“My dear,” Magdalena said, “you’re late. You smell like algae.”

“I’m your only niece. Who is going to tell me no?”

“Anyone with eyes,” Magdalena answered, and kissed her on the forehead with lips colder than the ring that wasn’t there. “You must eat something.”

Elowen sat at the long table and forced roast chicken and tiny green grapes into her mouth while she told a story about the river light and the way the corn had made a new sky with its awns and noise. It was not the story Magdalena had ordered, but the Regent’s smile widened by three millimeters each time Elowen gave a sensible verb to a silly thing.

“Do you know what they are saying?” Magdalena asked, at last, when the staff had been dismissed and the courthouse had emptied of citizens paying taxes and petitions. “They are saying a young woman from our town has been seen at the outskirts of disasters. They are saying the storm girl waves her hand and the wind makes a fist. They are saying she wears the emblem of Spring.”

“I didn’t know we had an emblem,” Elowen said lightly. “We barely have paperclips that match.”

Magdalena slid a picture across the table. It was a printout grainy enough to hide as much as it revealed. A figure in a ruined street walked with her hair up, a kind of messy crown that could have been string and could have been light. Around her feet, ash had fused into glass. And on her chest, a brooch shaped like a river bend, the exact bend that had been in Springfield’s seal since the first judge had declared himself mayor and the mayor had married a queen from elsewhere. It was a shallow bend, like a smile with a crushed tooth.

“Fashion is theft,” Elowen said after a minute. “She stole it from our catalogue. It doesn’t mean it is me.”

“I didn’t say her name,” Magdalena said. Her rings clinked softly against one another like the bell trying to breathe.

In the corner of the room, the old portrait of Elowen’s mother stared down with a look that had only ever been mistaken for kindness by the photographer himself. Elowen had never seen that woman smile with her mouth; she had known how to lay claim to a scene by looking blankly at it until it explained itself. She had died when Elowen was five. There were stories about that, too. Car accident. Bicycle accident. A deer at the wrong time. The river took and the river gave back wrong. The stories multiplied like a rumor could, given sunlight and a town with nothing better to do.

“What would you have me do?” Elowen asked. “Stand on the courthouse steps and tell the town I have never been to the coast? You have taught me better than that. Denials are only appetites wearing better shoes.”

“I would have you be seen from the right distance,” Magdalena said. “I would have you make a speech that contains the words responsible and measured and beloved. I would have you name the enemies no one will defend and call them enemies and then bow your head as if you are speaking to God and not to the part of yourself that collects other people’s hands.”

“And if I am the girl,” Elowen said suddenly, and it was true she didn’t know why the words came out, except that it had been a type of weather inside her all morning—heat flares, a humming in the bones behind the ears, a stickiness that felt like static, like cellophane. “If I am the one who walks at the edges of other people’s endings. What then?”

Magdalena did not blink. “Are you asking me what to do? If you are asking me, you already know, which means you want me to be the one who says it so you can pretend it came from elsewhere.”

“My aunt,” Elowen breathed.

“I would have you—what is the proper word? Surrender? Lay down? There are ways to remove the head of a story and still keep the neck alive. People are very good at believing in survivors if they smile and point at someone else bleeding on the floor.”

Elowen pushed her chair back, so hard it scraped the floor with a noise meant to be noticed. “Do you think you can make me into a good story with… what? Food and measured words and a string of men with open wallets from the capital to bless me as modern and inexpensive?”

“What I think,” Magdalena said, and her voice went quiet in the rich way that filled room and chest, “is that your mother gave you a country. She had a way of making gifts into knives, yes, but she did give it. And what I think is that you have been having spells.”

Elowen’s hand closed around the napkin. The paper gave, and she felt the soft tear like something parting between a wish and its center. “Everyone has spells. I’ve seen you at the memorial. You look down and forget to saw the ribbon, and the President pats your arm as if you’re a dog.”

“You are not very kind.” Magdalena tilted her head. “And you did not deny it.”

In her room at the top of the courthouse, the windows stuck stubbornly and required palms flat, hips ugly against the sill, to force them open. Elowen shoved and let the humid air slide over her bare knees. Outside, the square began to fill with people wearing faces of public cheer. There would be a band. There would be the marching of hats. There would be propane tanks heating meat until it became the smell of memory.

She sat at the small desk and wrote the same sentence three times in three different hands. I am six again and the river is full of glass. I am six again and the river is a woman lying on her back. I am six again and the river is asleep and I am awake and I am looking at my reflection and I can’t see me.

After the third, she drew a crown over the m. It was something she had done in notebooks since she was a child. Every letter could be a throne if you put a line at the top and called it sharp.

“You saw her, didn’t you,” said a voice at her door, and Elowen, startled, smudged the ink with the side of her hand and turned to see June Malley standing with a stack of pamphlets tucked against her chest. June wore her long hair braided around her head like a wreath, which made her look either ten or a priest. She had once cut a check from the library’s budget to buy Elowen a new dress when the hem of the old one had caught on the church pew like an accusation. People told that story too, about June’s small kindnesses as if they were parables with simple epilogues. No one knew why she had stayed after she’d been accepted to three different schools with names that made Springfield feel like the inside of a glove.

“Who?” Elowen asked too quickly.

June moved into the room with the restless ease of someone who had never once in her life been thrown out of anywhere, even when she’d broken a stained-glass window with her soccer ball. “The girl they keep talking about on the radio. The one from the coast. The one with the… thing.” She made a vague throat gesture that could have meant necklace. “Because the way you’re writing. The way your mouth looks like you chewed on lightning.”

“You’re not supposed to be in here,” Elowen said, but not cruelly. “The Regent would—”

“The Regent would find a way to give me a medal for my service to the public library and then turn up at my door with a polite little man and a clipboard and ask for the medal back.” June’s smile went sideways. “You know she wants you to make a speech.”

“I know.”

“You’re going to do it.”

“Yes.” The word came out organized. “And I’m going to say all the right nouns. And I’m going to mean them, I think. Most of them. About rivers and weather and responsibility and how my mother sent me to play with children whose fathers didn’t own any fields.”

June moved closer and touched the back of Elowen’s hand with the tips of her fingers, very gently, as if she were touching the fur on a sleeping animal and wanted to wake it kindly. “There’s more.”

“In the mirror, in the diner this morning,” Elowen said, and it felt a relief, actually, to say it out loud, as if naming could make an inhospitable country take your passport a little easier. “I saw a girl and she frowned at me, as if I were the stranger. And for a second—I know it’s stupid, June, I know—but for a second I was jealous of her, of the way she stood like the world made sense and like she could decide to walk into a place and it would welcome her without making her lose anything for it.”

June’s fingers remained where they were. “Did she look like you?”

Elowen thought of the picture Magdalena had slid across the table. The black glass fighting with the ash; the hair caught up like someone had made a crown of it too quick to be polite. “She looked like a part of me that doesn’t need anyone.”

“Then be careful,” June said. “People who don’t need anyone are hard to become, and once you do you forget that anybody else has hunger.”

Downstairs, the band started. Someone shouted something about hot dogs with a big important voice and then laughed at the wrong time. Elowen put on the suit Magdalena preferred for speeches—the one that turned her into an icon like a very well-behaved road sign—and pinned the brooch to her lapel. She hated it. It had been her mother’s, but mostly she hated it because it was so precisely the wrong green.

She stood behind the lectern, which was actually an old pulpit with the cross pried off, and watched the faces of her city shift their weight from foot to foot. People wished to believe in the simplest possible version of you; they wanted to buy you like produce. That’s the tenderness of it: they want to feed you to their children.

“Friends,” she said, and let the word sit. Once, in a dream she could not confess, she had said Subjects and it had fit like a dress made for someone else that still made you beautiful. She remembered the dream with the acute shame reserved for desire.

“You know why I’m here. We’ve been hearing news that terrifies me and the Regent and the council and anyone with elders or skylights or children who don’t wake at the first alarm. I wish I could tell you the news was wrong. What I can tell you is different. The story is bigger than they think.” She breathed and looked out where Jonah’s head bobbed near the front row beside June’s crown of braids. The two of them saw her as a person. It was a kind of play feed that filled her with grief.

“I remember the first time the bell made the wrong sound,” she said, and saw a flicker move through the crowd like rain starting. “It was after my mother died. I was… I was a child. I was expecting small things to stay themselves. The bell rang three times poorly and then it started again, like a man who had told the wrong joke and wanted another chance. The whole square went quiet. I thought, Good, now we are all paying attention. Even the pigeons. And then I thought, Bad, because if we are all paying attention, we will have to hear what the world says when it wants to speak and doesn’t know our words.”

Laughter came, the kind that slips and recovers and is grateful. It steadied Elowen. She could lift this thing with both hands. She could say the names Magdalena wanted—security, diligence, partnership. She could be the thing you be when you win the middle of a story.

“I will go wherever we need to go,” she said, and the words came before she could decide if she believed them. “If there is a girl who wears our emblem and walks through the wrong kind of weather, then I will find her. Not because I want a fight. Because I want a conversation. Because there is something rotten in this throat of mine when I hear her called enemy, and it tastes like knowledge.”

Jonah flinched at that; his mouth opened. Magdalena’s expression did not change.

“And if it is me, if I am the girl, if when I am sleeping I am walking on someone else’s heartbreak? If the wind knows me by another name? Then I will ask you to help me gather the part of me that is not housebroken and make her sit with us at the table until her teeth are used for bread and not bone.” She realized her hands were shaking. She left them on the wood, not hiding them, and Jane from the bakery, the one with arms like an anchor, lifted her chin in the audience like It’s all right, the boys shake too, you know.

She finished with gratitude and the Three Promises—the Regent’s invention, a liturgy with a focus group behind it. The square emptied in the way squares do, quickly and piece by piece until only the cigarette smoke hung around like a bad idea that still wanted a chance. Jonah and June came around the pulpit, one from each side, and when they bracketed her like that, Elowen remembered the old story of the twin wolves: one black, one gray. Feed the one you want to win, the elders say. But what if they both want to eat you and not the bowl?

“You didn’t ask permission,” Jonah said, but he was still smiling.

“She doesn’t know how,” June said. “Bless her.”

“Not a blessing,” Magdalena remarked from behind them, and the three of them separated like coins falling. “You promised to go and look for a rumor with my name on your coat. There were donors in town today, Elowen. They will cut their checks risibly small if you keep reminding them that we are responsible to mysteries.”

“We are responsible to mysteries,” Elowen said. “That’s the job. The title is a myth with a municipal budget.”

June swallowed a laugh, and Jonah, unwilling to be caught between Regent and Princess, went to retrieve his mother’s antique thermos from the church steps.

“Come with me,” Magdalena murmured, and there was no room in that tone for disobedience. They went through the courthouse and down, farther down than Elowen had ever gone, to a door with a lock that had grown into the wood from disuse. Magdalena removed her ring and pressed it into a stone set in the wall. The stone thrummed.

“We are going to play a game,” Magdalena said softly. “It is older than the First Pledge and columned buildings. I am going to show you something that will show you something back. It is a thing your mother forgot to teach you before she died or refused to, I was never quite sure which, and I have regretted that omission nearly as much as I have appreciated it.”

The room was cool with the kind of cool that belongs to caves and butcher shops. A long slab of glass lay on an iron frame. Once it might have been green; now it was the color of river light killed by a cloud. In the glass, faintly, the courthouse ceiling reflected itself, the angels washing their hair.

“It is a mirror,” Elowen said, and then belatedly, “No. No, it’s not.”

“It’s a map where the traveled places are yourself,” Magdalena said. “It was brought from the coast by a woman who would not give her name and would not eat bread. She married the first judge in order not to be dragged from our square by her hair. She could stand with a look that made men walk backward.” Magdalena kissed her ring finger, without the ring on it, the way people do when they are trying to remember how to be reverent.

“What does it do?”

“It shows you both the king and the unking.”

“That is not a noun.”

“It is today. Put your hand to it.”

Elowen touched the glass. It was warmer than the air and then, suddenly, precisely her temperature. The hair on her arms went up as if she had rubbed a balloon across them. For a second nothing happened. Then there was movement in the glass that was not the ceiling nor the lamp nor her. A ripple like something alive that had been pretending to be flat.

In the glass, a girl stood two steps away, and Elowen’s first thought was that she was embarrassed to have a guest in her unclean house. The second thought was the more important, and it was that the girl looked familiar in the manner of a recurring dream you’ve had since your mother was alive. The third thought was: That crown suits her.

It was not a crown really, but the way wind and hair and attention had been curated into the idea of one. The girl raised a hand in the glass, and Elowen raised hers, and the movement did not match. The other girl’s hands had small scars across the pads, as if she had climbed a lot of fences in someone else’s town.

“Are you doing that?” Elowen asked.

“I am not doing anything at all,” Magdalena said. “Watch.”

The other girl tilted her head. She was not Elowen. She was Elowen like an anagram is a name.

“Hello,” the girl said, and it was hard to tell whether Elowen heard the sound in her head or in her ear. The glass, after all, had been made to confound. “You have my brooch.”

“You have my hair,” Elowen replied.

“Do I?” The girl smiled. “We can trade. Or not. It depends on how hungry you are.”

Elowen took her palm off the glass and the image wavered like oil in a pan. “You—”

“Don’t break her,” Magdalena warned, and the pronoun turned out to be Elowen’s.

“What do you want?” Elowen asked the girl. She hated the way the sentence had come out pleading. She did not want to be the person who asked the mirror for mercy.

“To walk where I want,” the girl said.

“That’s vague,” Elowen said.

“To hold my weather,” the girl clarified, and her look slid past Elowen’s shoulder to Magdalena, as if she had known her once, in another doorway. “Is that your mother?”

“My aunt.”

“Very well. That makes you more dangerous.”

Elowen could not think of a useful thing to say. She had an urge to pat her pockets, but her suit had no pockets because the man who designed it thought women who carry needed to be stopped.

“People are dying,” she said finally, and it was ridiculous to say it like this, as if the girl did not know, as if the mirror had been ignorant enough to spare her in its reflections. “If you have something to do with that—”

“I do,” the girl said, almost kindly. “I’m sorry. It is not what you think. It is not a club I want to belong to, the people who make endings. But sometimes the storm is the only sentence that fits in the space.”

Elowen flinched. “Do you wish me to hate you?”

“No,” the girl said. “I wish you to become me. Or I wish to become you. It amounts to a similar type of hunger.”

Elowen backed away and the glass cooled under her breath. It hazed for a second, and for a second, she saw something else: the river, full of broken bottles; a child on the bank with a crown made out of the thing her mother had used to hold curtains back; a deer standing with its ankles in the water and the water burning. Oh, the way a river burns, Elowen thought, stupidly, as if she were trying to be literary in her own terror. The way a thing can choose not to be itself. And then it was just a mirror again, and she saw how tired she looked and wondered if Magdalena had always seen her this way and had simply been polite.

“I want to sit down,” Elowen said.

“You may,” Magdalena allowed. “We will do this slowly. The glass is like a friend you have to introduce yourself to, over and over.”

“What do you call her?” Elowen whispered, thinking that if she named the girl out loud it would wedge the word into her family tree, and then it would be impossible to pluck out.

“They are calling her Princess Blackflower, I am told, on the radio,” Magdalena said, with distaste. “They think it sounds like nature, which is to say feminine, which is to say able to be both worshiped and blamed and photographed at the same time. Names are traps people set when they’re afraid of distance.”

Elowen thought of all the missing persons posters in the alley. She thought of the ring she had lost and how she woke in the night sometimes with her palm closed as if, in sleep, she had been lifting it up and down like a weight. Princess Blackflower. She hated the way the name felt like a bruise on her gums.

That night, she did not go home, because the courthouse had become a shape she could live in. Jonah slept on the bench outside her door, as if he were inconvenient furniture, because he had always been uncomfortable with the parts of nights that did not allow one to fight or eat. June returned to the library and touched the spines of the books in the disaster aisle and felt the surprise that, given the headlines, no one had borrowed any of them for months.

Elowen dreamed standing up, her back to the cool mirror and her face to the window. In the dream the river made a sound she had never heard, and then did not again. She raised her hands and something answered in the distance, and then the answering un-happened. The bell rang three times wrong. She woke and found the sound had been real. The clock blinked. Someone had broken into the library in the small hours and stolen a book that was not valuable except if you needed to read a map where the traveled places were yourself.

In the morning June stood in her doorway with the book smiling like guilt. She put it on Elowen’s desk and said, “Do not thank me. It will make me feel complicit.”

“You are complicit,” Elowen said gently.

“I know.”

Jonah folded his jacket and handed her a thermos of coffee that had become a kind of promise between them. “We’ll go?” he asked. “If you’re going to go, then I will go and carry… whatever it is people carry when they go with princesses. Snacks? Rope?”

“Are you coming because you think I won’t come back?” Elowen asked, trying to catch his eye.

“I’m coming because you’ll forget to leave a note,” Jonah said, and for a second she loved him for making a sentence that turned her into a person with habits.

“Do not be sentimental,” Magdalena said into the space of their pause. She pressed the brooch into Elowen’s hand until Elowen thought her skin would acquire its bruise. “Wear it where it shows. It will save us twenty minutes of explaining at every door and cost us only five minutes of insults we can pretend we didn’t hear.”

They went to the river, because the river was closest, and because the city had the quiet now that happens when an inside joke goes too far and everyone fears a fight. They followed the bend that made the seal and turned left into the part of town that smelled like old tires and vinegar. An air raid siren had been mounted there since the sixties and had never once worked, but people still walked past it like it might want to be saluted.

Elowen stood on the bank where the grass gave up and the dirt made its wrong red. The water looked kind in the way that kills you. She put her hand to the glass of the mirror she had tucked into a soft sleeve in her pack, then pulled it away. The mirror would not help her here yet. It needed indoor light and secrets to perform.

Instead she closed her eyes and tried to call to the part of her that had screamed silently at the square. She found it easily. It was where it always was, in the place between her lungs and the thing that made her say sensible words. It was like holding a dog by the collar when it sees another dog across the street. It was like remembering—No, she thought, scoldingly. It is itself. It is not a comparison.

The wind picked up. The corn on the far side of the river bowed slightly, and then all at once it didn’t. The bow stopped as if someone had cut the video. A leaf hung halfway in its rustle. A man on the road across lifted his hand to wipe his nose and stayed like that, his hand in the air, his face frozen between itches. The world did not stop breathing exactly, but it took the kind of breath that hurts your ribs and then refused to let it go.

June said, clearly, “Okay, now I’m frightened.”

Elowen opened her eyes. The river moved sluggishly like syrup. It had gone thick. Her blood tried to match it.

“Don’t,” she said. “Don’t this. Not here.”

A girl stood on the far bank. She wore no crown and no brooch, and her hair had not been styled into anything except necessity, and she had the exact same expression as Elowen except she was better at holding still. It was the kind of motionlessness one learns when one hides for a living.

“I do this where I want,” the girl said. Her voice came across the water in a pitch that did not belong to distance. “Because it’s not an act. Because it’s the only way to hear the soft things.”

“Stop,” Elowen said. “Please.”

June took Elowen’s hand and Jonah, without knowing he had done it, had already put himself halfway between the two of them in the mud.

“You said you would talk,” Elowen said to the girl.

“I am talking,” the girl said. The wind pulled at the end of her sentence and made it stranger.

“What is your name,” Elowen asked. It was indecent and necessary to ask it, like asking a midwife what she prefers to be called as you grunt on her table.

“I don’t like the one they give me,” the girl said. “It feels like chewing buckles. But I suppose you would call me the name that keeps people turning the dial up when the preacher speaks. And your aunt calls me unking, which I like better.”

“I’ll call you El,” Elowen said, abruptly and stupidly, the way someone will pet a wild dog and call it by a small name to try to haunt it nicer. “Like me, like a letter.”

The girl smiled, quick. “El is fine. They called you the river when you were small because you would not stay in your chair. That was my favorite thing about you. I took it.”

“I want you to put it back,” Elowen said, and felt the blunt hollowness of the sentence. The wind, offended by being held in someone else’s hand, snapped once, like a white towel shaking out its crease, and the corn moved, all of it, and the man blew his nose and walked on, whistling, not knowing his nose had been interrupted by the oldest of tricks.

El stood on the other bank with her arms at her sides like the possibility of flight. Four finches landed on the wires overhead. The bell would inevitably ring wrong soon, and that thought filled Elowen with an absurd tenderness toward iron and men who pulled ropes.

“I wanted to love us,” El said. “I missed our mother.”

“We are not the same,” Elowen said, and had to believe it. She had to.

El sighed. It was such a human sound that Elowen felt like she had been slapped with a soft glove. “If you believe that, keep believing it as long as you can, and then we’ll write a new name together. But in the meantime,” she said, and turned her head toward the west, where something had already started to smoke above the train yard. “You are going to learn very quickly how to stop a thing you started in your sleep. And you will say you didn’t mean to. And we will both be right.”

She was gone before the bell had time to fail. June let go of Elowen’s hand like the end of a swing, gently, so the other did not bite.

“I don’t want to be part of a miracle,” Jonah said dully. “I want to fix the brake lines on the county van.”

“You can do both,” June said, though her voice was weak. “People do. Wars and grocery lists. Plagues and rent. You think I stopped scrubbing the floor because the sky is cracked?”

Elowen looked at the smoke and briskly, in a tiny way that was not royal at all, took the brooch off her lapel and put it into her pocket where it pricked her. She would talk to El again. She would look into the glass until her eyes rubbed smooth. She would learn the weather of her own skull. She would go west to the yard, because the yard had children sometimes who thought trains were wishes with wheels. She would be what people needed her to be, and she would be what the mirror told her she already was, and it would be complicated, and it would be ugly, and there would be a speech in a church about how complicated had been a holy word all along, and all of that could be later. For now, she looked at Jonah and June and said, “Come on,” and they went, because the worst of it was the way the world had been behaving like it wanted to be saved and had chosen a town with a broken bell to make the suggestion.

The air quality dropped. Sirens put on their games. Men who had never cried in public put on the faces they used for birth and courthouse steps. Magdalena made three calls in a room with no windows and said three different things, all true enough to be bought and sold. And the girl in the glass, wherever she was when the people who were not Elowen saw her, stood at the lip of something that thought it was a mouth, and lifted her hands, like prayer and yoke, and the wind, obedient and in love, made a fist and unclenched it, and in the space where unclenching happens, a choice waited patiently, and the bell, on schedule and not at all, rang three terrible, familiar, wrong-sounding times.They cut west as if a compass had been buried under the courthouse and some old metal in Elowen’s ribs felt it. Smoke lay down across the train yard with the defeated grace of a dog in summer, panting, trying to be both blanket and warning. The air tasted like pennies and baked plastic. People had the faces they used for cameras and babies, practiced concern stretched over bones that would rather be at work. Elowen thought every town had a way of making a siren private. In Springfield, the siren sounded the way a boy sounds when he tries to joke through a bruise: high, breathy, a little proud that it can manage to rise at all.

The yard was a gridded cathedral of metal and stamp, the rails shining like the neatest handwriting the county had ever produced. Tankers sat shouldered up, their round bellies reflecting a wrong green sky, while open cars were heaped with coal that looked meek until it remembered what it was before it burned. Something stuttered and hissed from the far tracks where three men in vests the color of traffic cones waved their arms like scarecrows who had learned semaphore in a storm. A white-lettered stencil on the nearest tanker said ANHYDROUS in weary capitals that did not expect to be listened to. Beyond it, a row of cars carrying lumber kept tiny lightning trapped between slats, the kind of electric spit that makes your hair lift if you are unlucky enough to walk under it on a dry day.

June pressed the stolen book to her stomach, as if her belly knew more about the old ways than her head did. The cover had a municipal look, the sort of tome that wants to help you interpret zoning, but it opened into something that had never expected to be read in English. The pages had diagrams drawn in a hand that was careful and impatient at once. There were shapes that looked like lungs and wind roses drawn with knots where the cardinal points would be. June licked her finger like a thief about to count money and flipped to a page titled Holding and Letting Go in a script that had no business being alive after three reorganizations of the state library budget. “Listen,” she said, because saying look would only curdle the panic around them. “Here. ‘When breath is taken prisoner, do not beg it for bail. Offer it three things: a gate, a gift, and a witness.’”

“I have rope,” Jonah said grimly, because he could not bear a rule that did not put hands on something. “Gates are just fences pretending to be polite. I can climb a polite fence.”

“Children,” June said, chin flicking toward the chain link where three of them had already wedged themselves where diamonds become squares and paint becomes an edge that doesn’t respect knuckles. “Gate one: tell those animals to go home.”

Jonah went without asking how. His body remembered being told to do things the same way his grandfather’s old pickup remembered how to find neutral, stubbornly, after too much torque. He swung his leg over, tore his thigh in two neat places on a bit of proud wire, and hit dirt with the noise of a promise keeping itself. The little ones gave him the hard eyes children give to adults who have sex with fear and then tell it what to do for fun. He had the advantage of seeming like the wrong sort of policeman and the right sort of older brother. He peeled their fingers off the fence one by one and made a game of it, a magic trick in which boys became boys again and not possible funerals. In the process he cut his palm on a bolt-head that looked exactly like something that wanted to be an emblem. It bled as neatly as a truth.

The air seemed to remember something terrible and then decide to pause and respect it. The light slowed like syrup being convinced to change religions. A bird mid-flight forgot what wings were for and hung in a perfect crooked origami, its beak open in an opinion no one would ever hear. A droplet of something that had percolated from under the tankers hooked itself in a half-curve and stayed there like punctuation at the end of a prayer you suspect is the wrong one. Elowen felt the pause arrive not as silence but as an extra sentence laid across all their bodies. Her teeth throbbed in time with it. Her heart, disobedient, tried to double its beat and ran hard into a wall.

“El,” Elowen said, and did not turn her head. In the curve of the nearest tanker, in the dull mirror of paint and warning, a girl stood whose hair had organized itself without asking a salon’s permission. The reflection made her taller and older than the angle should have permitted. The bent metal made a crown of smoke sit high and casual. “You said you would talk.”

“I am,” said the counsel from nowhere, calm and exasperated like a teacher explaining for the thirtieth time that red plus white always makes pink even if you wish it made wine. The sound did not travel; it just arrived. “They stored the wrong thing next to the wrong thing, and the heat put its shoulder into both. I pulled.”

“You pulled the world into its own braces.” Elowen tried to swallow, found the swallow had been set on a shelf for later, and did the older, uglier thing, which is to accept suffocation and plan anyway. “They can’t breathe like this.”

“If I let this moment go,” El said, “the tanks talk in a language you do not want to translate.” She did not smile, because she was not wicked; she simply had no training in courting a town while she killed it. “Help me unclench it carefully and we will write a new grammar.”

June had already begun to read. She flattened the book on her palm and laid it against Elowen’s shoulder like a cool cloth. “‘Gate is not the same as door,’” she read, and Elowen loved her a little for saying it in the same tone she used to tell the second-graders not to lick the paste. “‘A door is an agreement. A gate is a limit with a hinge. To make a gate for a storm, open the thing that believes it holds the rule.’”

“The switch house,” Jonah called through the kind of stillness that hates shouts. His voice arrived as if it had to work three extra hours to find them. He pointed with his chin at the squat cinderblock hut where the yard official who liked to drink coffee and call trains by their pet names kept the levers that moved metal where it went without thinking. “There’s a horn in there that the men bully for fun when there’s a birthday. It’s pinned to the same line as the yard signal. You bang it in the wrong rhythm and the rail heads get confused and stand up straighter. It’s stupid. It works.”

“Gate,” June diagnosed rapidly. “We confuse the rule of the place that thinks it is the most important rule here. We give the air another path by giving the tracks a slightly ridiculous instruction.”

“My aunt will say you made poetry out of infrastructure,” Elowen said, and reached into her pocket. The brooch pricked her thumb the way old jewelry does when it knows it is being abandoned. She pulled it out and saw, with an indecent shiver of cheer, that its river bend had collected a silt of her own skin in its grooves. “All right. That’s gate. What is the gift?”

June’s finger slid down the page and came up with a grief-smudged mark. “‘Gift the thing you will not be forgiven for losing,’” she read. “‘Or give the thing that always thought it was yours anyway.’”

Elowen’s hand closed around both sentences at once. She kissed the brooch because that is what people do when they cannot lift the weight they want to say to the dead, and then she set her jaw and threw it under the tanker where the gathered liquid—water, corrosive, promise—held it like a green eye. In that pause, the act traveled into the place in her chest where her mother had left her a room with no furniture. Something answered. It was not forgiveness. It was bigger and crueler and companionable.

“And the witness,” June whispered, her mouth close now because whispering wore less poorly in air like this. “‘Say a true name and keep your eyes open for the answer. Do not say God’s name. He is busy.’”

Elowen thought of the posters with crowns scratched on and off. She thought of the girl with the blue ribbon and the gap in her teeth, the way people had put her face on the soda machine at the grocery as if sugar could hire a search party. “Edda May Fulton,” Elowen said, and the way she did it made Jonah’s jaw stiffen because it was the voice she had learned to use at funerals when it would not do to tell the whole truth about anybody. “You ran away because your mother wouldn’t let you pierce your ears and you, my friend, my subject, made it to the Boone County line and then turned around because you were hungry.” She kept her eyes open, and because the world is sometimes kinder than rules, a small figure on the far side of the yard moved in the corner of her vision—just enough. A bobbling ponytail. A slow, brave hand raised, as if the name had been a rope thrown across some old, unlit water.

Jonah ran. He did not think first. He did not wait for permission. He went long in three strides and then was inside the square cement house where a horn waited like an old man who has trained his laugh to be wise. The switch panel glowed dully. He punched the button that made the yard howl, and then he let it go, and then he punched it again, with a lopsidedness that made the machine feel both mocked and loved, and then punched it once more too close on the heels of the second, so that the three climbed over one another gracelessly. The sound ripped, tore, tried to become a song and settled for being an announcement that everything had changed its mind.

The rails shivered. Elowen felt the cold iron under a hundred miles of track remember the first time it had been red-hot and wanted to live a different life. The air’s clutch on her lungs loosened half a finger. She put her hands out the way a child does when she hopes the bicycle knows how to balance itself and spoke to the part of herself that had pulled this pause like a blanket over the yard. It was not malevolent. It was just big, and untrained, and in love with its own strength. “Let,” she told it, quietly. “Let go. That’s your gift back. We made the gate. The gift is gone. The witness is named. You can breathe their breath for them if you must, but let them spend it.”

The world wobbled like a record with a bad edge. The bird discovered wings again and overcompensated, shooting high enough to hate itself and then to forget that, because it was busy. The droplet fell and hit the puddle and made a ring around the brooch that looked like a crown long after fashion had gone home. A man who had been holding his sneeze without his own consent finally sprayed into his sleeve and looked bashfully around for a handkerchief in air that had no time for bashfulness. The tankers complained, stretched, made the kind of sound steel makes when it resents having to be skin. Something in one of them gave, but it gave sideways into foam because two of the orange-vested men had had the good sense to lay a hose very precisely on the wrong place and then pretend with their faces that they had always meant it.

El’s reflection in the tanker bent with the paint. She looked old for a breath and then younger. For a second Elowen saw past El to a horizon that did not belong to the yard at all—a single windmill on a hillside outside of this story, spinning with the patience of a saint. El lifted her hand not to command but to apologize. Elowen couldn’t tell for what, exactly, and that was the part that made her throat ache. Then the reflection became the yard again, the hard fact of dings and decals, and the trick of seeing across distances folded itself like a napkin for later.

They moved in the strange routine that comes after almost: hoses set just so, men cursing the respectful curses, the chief making his voice deep because it sounded like a life jacket. A paramedic with tired perfume wrapped Jonah’s palm and told him he was a brave idiot, which had been his favorite blessing since he learned what he could not be. June kept the book under her arm as if someone might step out of a siding and ask to borrow it. Elowen stood without knowing where to put her hands and watched Edda May step through the gap between two boxcars as if she had been born from freight. The girl looked like a photo that had been worn next to someone’s skin for weeks. Elowen wanted to touch her shoulder and tell it it had done a good job holding up such a difficult head.

Magdalena arrived with clean hair and a face that could juggle three messages without looking down at her fingers. There was a man from the newspaper stuck to her side like moss. His tie was committed to an old idea of work. He said Princess and made a swallowing sound after it, partly awe and partly indigestion, and thrust a microphone with a foam cap toward Elowen like a communion. The Regent breathed in through her nose in a way that could, in a friendlier family, have been mistaken for fondness. “Your method,” she said. “Plural, I assume. Irresponsible enough to be inevitable.”

“It was a horn and a gift and a name,” Elowen answered. She did not meet the tie’s eyes. She did not lower her head just yet for the town, because she was still full of the wrong kind of weather, and she was old enough to know not to bring a storm into a bow. “And some luck that people keep calling God because if you blame God, you don’t have to look your neighbors in the face when you thank them.”

“You must smile,” Magdalena said without moving her mouth. Only someone who had been raised on the periphery of her sister’s shadow could have heard it. “There are donors who like teeth.”

Elowen smiled. It felt like showing an heirloom to a thief and hoping theft would be so tired that day it would forget itself. The man with the tie asked her to say what she had learned. She said a thing about preparedness that would read well over coffee and pancakes, and then she said a thing about how wind isn’t a weapon until you point it at somebody, and then she said a thing about children that was simple and therefore suspiciously true. Someone clapped in a way meant to be noticed. The yard exhaled smoke like it had been caught.

By late afternoon, the heat had grown bored with itself and went to bother someone else. The city resumed the soft fiction that it was a place where the big things happened on the coast, and here, here we have birthdays and stolen kisses in parking lots and a football game that ends at the exact minute your grandmother gets heartburn. June returned the book to her shirt and let it cool against her sternum. Jonah, restless as a dog who had not been allowed to fight enough, took to tightening the coupling on the engine house’s door with a wrench like he was angry about algebra. Elowen walked to the edge of the yard where the fence forgot it was supposed to complete a line and sat on a stack of pallets that had known a hundred human weights without preferring any of them.

The mirror in her pack had heated itself during the event, the way a tool grows warm when it is thinking of being used. She slid it out and laid it on her thighs and watched the sky behind her move in it like a lake wearing a tight dress. Nothing arrived. No girl with arrogance braided into mercy. No old woman with a ring for a lock. Just Elowen, with her hair coming down around its pins like a building politely retiring. It should have comforted her that her face was only her face. It made her feel like a candle in an auditorium.

“Do you know where it is?” June asked, quiet, as if the question were a domestic animal that needed coaxing.

“Where what is?”

“The ring.” June did not look up from the book. It was impolite to look people in the mouth when you asked them where their missing pieces were. “You keep touching your hand like it remembers the weight of something heavier than metal.”

“In the clock,” Elowen said before she could build a cage for the answer. It sat in the sentence obediently, like a disappointed cat. “In the mouth of the clock at the library. In the place where the hour hand jumps wrong. In a dream. Which is a stupid way to lose jewelry. You can’t call the locksmith who speaks dream.”

June considered this like a person appraises a strange ladder: disrespectful but possibly useful. “The clock mounts inside in a way the janitor refuses to describe because it would make the janitor less important. We can go tonight. There is a bats’ lease that means we have to put towels over our heads in the top room during certain months. I have towels.”

“After dinner,” Jonah said firmly, because he liked to put meals into danger and see which blinked first. He lifted his bandaged hand. It looked like something new and dangerous he was practicing. “You’ll climb. I’ll wait at the bottom and tell jokes that make the bats consider moving to a more sophisticated branch.”

Magdalena wanted her to come home, which meant the courthouse, which meant a table with ten chairs and a knife at every place setting so small it could be packed in a purse. “We will practice,” the Regent said. She had linked arms with Elowen as if they were two old women pretending to be sisters on a promenade where a band does its best songs again. “You will practice not giving your throat to the first wind that asks for it. We have been given sloppy definitions of sacrifice. We will improve the typography.”

“If I do not give my throat to something,” Elowen said, too sweetly for manners, “how will we eat bread?” It delighted her just the littlest bit to see Magdalena turn her head the way a stag does when you have embarrassed him by making him step into a kiddie pool.

They did not go to the courthouse. They went to the library when the sky had the peculiar clean blue it gets after fire, as if it had been laundered too hard and would rip if you wore it. June unlocked the side door with a key attached to a string she had braided herself and led them through the stacks that still smelled like randos laying themselves down to nap between wars. The children’s nook had a rubber duck someone had left twenty years before when a parade had taken a wrong turn and spilled into story time. A poster that said QUIET PLEASE in big letters was curling at the corners like a fingernail.

The clock tower began where the biographies ran out. The steps were angry with their own noise; every footfall produced two sounds, one for what had happened and one for what the steps hoped would happen next. In the second-floor landing, June pulled old towels from a crate labeled EMERGENCY and handed them out like benedictions. They draped them over their heads and then could not help but laugh, which felt dishonest, considering the day they had had. Bats—those small facts of the night that people forget to love because they are not polite—shifted above, whispering about fruit and sex and highways.

Elowen’s palm shocked her with the force of the old habit. The ring had lived there long enough to move the flesh into a permanent welcome. She pressed the spot against the wall as if touching the building could place her finger back into the hand it had lost. The mechanism of the clock sat behind a door that had a padlock hung on it like a threat from a previous administration. June produced a key that was not a key but a bent bit of cafeteria tray metal someone had shaved with malice into a shape that fooled brass. She loved that about June. The trick was never to ask why the library had so many little tools for deceiving the parts of itself that liked to say no.

Inside, the clock arranged itself like a diagram of patience. The gears, a clean gold the color of pretend coins, turned and caught and released themselves with the courtesy of old couples. The weight hung like the moral of a story, ready to fall if no one caught it. The face let light in from the square, which made it seem both far away and too close, a trick all public buildings learn whether they like it or not.

Elowen climbed onto the small ledge and put her arm into the clock’s mouth where the hands met the post. The metal licked at her skin with indifferent roughness. The hour hand, an obedient blade, trembled and steadied. She reached deeper and felt the forgetful heat of a place that spends all its time pretending to be the middle of everything. Her fingers brushed something that could have been a penny or a ring or the memory of a hand. She swallowed, and the sound of the swallow finally went somewhere, god bless it.

“Left a little,” June advised softly, as if they were driving backwards up a grandparents’ driveway. “The part where the hand stutters happens near the nick. Remember the nick? We talked about it in committee for a year. Whether to replace the whole thing or let it be true to its own errors.”

“I was not invited to that committee,” Elowen said, and felt the world between two teeth. Her fingers found the thing. It bit. She closed her hand around it and pulled, and the clock protested with a noise like a cat dragged by the tail away from milk. Her wrist scraped the edges she had known would be there. She smelled her own blood and felt, with despairing amusement, the way the wound matched the one in her dream, and thought how insulting it is when your own mind is that predictable and cruel.

The ring came free. It was colder than anything else in the room could have managed to be. It had lived like an idea inside a place that organizes days and had been collecting them the way rings do when they are bored. It stuck to her finger obediently, as if it had been waiting for an apology and now had one. For a moment, Elowen looked down at her hand and didn’t recognize it. For a moment, she saw the girl in the glass slip her borrowed hands over hers, as if your two bodies could agree to be gloves for each other.

“I think,” Jonah said from behind his towel, where his face had become a pair of earnest eyes and a bandaid, “that I would very much like this all to be the part of a story that turns out later to be just some people helping some people and not the beginning of the part where there is a funeral with poor snacks.”

Elowen slid off the ledge and stood very still while her skin decided to hold her blood where it belonged and not spill it onto county property. The ring warmed. It warmed in the particular way stones warm when you press them overnight in your fist and wake with the imprint on your palm so deep it looks like instruction. The bell, two rooms above and a world away, made a click. It had not yet rung wrong, which in itself made the air feel untrustworthy. She put her hand out, the ring shining like a small, sullen moon, and touched June’s arm. In her chest, something shifted to fit the weight.

“You are about to tell us something you do not know how to say,” June observed, pulling the towel off her head and dropping it over the emergency crate with a minute’s affection for its future.

“I think she put it there,” Elowen said. She hated her own pronoun, how it could be mother or aunt or other or herself and the grammar asked for a diagram she could not provide. “Or I put it there somewhere else and I am only now catching up to the part of me that thought to be careful.”

“You can both be thieves,” June said. “Two hands taking and none of them turning out to be wrong. We do not have good words for that. Maybe unking is a good word when there is stealing we needed to be done.”

Down in the square, someone was leaving flowers where there was no one to put them, because flowers are the thing you do when you do not know what to do and someone might take a picture and not notice your face. Elowen pressed the ring to her mouth and tasted iron and soap and her mother’s old perfume, or else she invented it because longing has a way of making bottles weeping again years after they are empty. Somewhere toward the west again, sirens pulled themselves together and started the game where they race with their own tails. The town, like all towns, settled into the bruise and brag of How We Survived, which it would tell for three months and then forget until it needed it behind someone’s headstone.

Outside the clock room, Magdalena’s voice rose on the landing, and it was carrying the fulsome heat of someone who had decided to make the word niece into a weapon with two edges. She had climbed without sweating, because some women arrange their bodies so that their blood behaves like a gentleman. Elowen could hear, in her aunt’s tone, three things, all incompatible and all true: a strategy, a warning, and an old, tired love that had been kept in a drawer and taken out only on Sundays because it did not go with most outfits.

“Elowen,” Magdalena called. “There is a pastor from the south on the radio again who has said a name I am pretty sure does not belong to you. He has given it too many syllables. He does not know how small you are when you are sleeping. Come down. We will measure you together, and if we cannot make you taller, we will make everyone’s yard shorter.”

Elowen looked at the ring, at the gear that had taken its skin, at June’s hands built for turning pages and suddenly for opening gates, at Jonah’s body, restless and concluded, and then past them to where the glass of the clock face let the town’s light in like gossip. Her other self was quiet, where quiet means thoughtful and not absent. The wind outside never stopped to ask itself who it was made for. The clock ticked a little wrong and then corrected itself, embarrassed. Somewhere one floor down a bat fell in love with a moth and changed its flight.

“We’re coming,” Elowen said, not because she had agreed but because some sentences help the stairs feel less alone. She wiped her blood on the towel and put it back neatly in the crate. She set the book on top of it, and it looked like an altar someone had made with impatience and good taste. Then she turned, and for a breath, the glass in the clock caught her face and held it unkindly. It made her look old in the particular way responsibility makes ribs old. She tried to smile at herself and saw, instead, the exact strength of her mother’s mouth, which is to say, the exact shape of a woman who loved a country more than she loved anything that could not vote.

They went down into the library’s gut the way old families move through each other’s kitchens: stepping around knives, pretending not to see the thing by the sink that belongs to a story they are not ready to hear. Outside, the river was running its usual dull color, but if you squinted you could see something glitter in it for three steps, like language trying to decide what it wants to be used for. The bell upstairs considered itself. It had to decide, as it did every day, whether it would be wrong alone or right loudly. And in a town where everyone is neighbor and audience and judge and the same soft thing behind the eyes, those are choices worth practicing before breakfast.Magdalena waited with her hand on the banister in a way that made the wood remember it used to be a tree. The radio voice that had driven her up the stairs still leaked from the small speaker June kept hidden under the returns desk, a man down south turning theology into a carnival bark. He liked his syllables dressed for church; he wrapped Elowen’s not-name in velvet and needle and came up with something that had to wear high heels to cross a room. Magdalena frowned as if the sound insulted the paint. “He has the right rhythm and the wrong mouth,” she said. “We will decide what to do with that. Not him—he is useful, like a skunk, if you let it advertise the perimeter. The name.”

“I’m not wearing whatever hat he sews for me,” Elowen said, and it came out braver than she felt. The ring tightened like a hand around hers and then relented, as if it had been checking that she still had bones. Her wrist had stopped bleeding, which in itself felt like a tribute the building had accepted in a bored, municipal way.

Magdalena’s eyes flicked to the ring and back up, and there was a brief, ungoverned flare of relief that made her look ten years younger. “Ah,” she said, and then covered the soft thing with something crueler. “You always come home to your own chains when you have had a fright. Good. We can pad them better. There is chicken or there can be soup. There is the man from the paper. We should give him both sugar and a reason to misquote us. It makes the correction worth another column.”

June set the book softly into Magdalena’s empty hand. “We needed this,” she said without apology. “We might need it again. It has diagrams like recipes, and people pay attention to recipes when they don’t want to admit they prayed.”

The Regent, who had made a life out of turning prayer into budgeting, weighed the book like a friend whose coarseness one forgives because she owns a snowplow. “I’m not your principal, June Malley. I am your aunt’s principal,” she said, and then, to Elowen, with a thin bit of pride: “You gave our brooch to the wrong puddle at the right time. I approve, and I will mourn it theatrically tomorrow where witnesses can sustain me with checks.”

Elowen laughed because the alternative was to let her eyes do the thing they had been threatening for days and not stop. “It will wash up in a field and a cow will wear it for a while in its gut,” she said. “Then a boy with a sharp stick will find it and think he has married the river.” She wanted this to be a joke, but the ring at her knuckle pulsed once as if to say the boy already existed.

“We should feed you,” Magdalena repeated, reshaping the evening like clay. “And then we should rehearse. Pastor Invitational downstate has ordained a march and thinks he can sell your town back to you at a discount if he drags his flock through in rough pastel. We will be polite to his hat and very unkind to his narrative.”

They went to the courthouse because there are nights when even fugitives from their own stories go home for a fork. The square had taken its breath back and was using it for gossip. Jane from the bakery leaned against her truck with her elbows making a heart of muscle and told the man who ran the hardware that she’d seen a girl in the rails shine and it had been a coat of paint trick and then, in the same breath, told her own shoulder that God had been a gentleman. Children had turned the caution tape into a cape and chased one another around the statue of the first judge, who had never looked less like someone’s idea of a husband.

Dinner was the kind where people remember to drink water only when they think you will notice. Magdalena had invited two donors who smelled like paper and almonds and believed that giving to a small city was a sport for retired kings. They smiled the way men do who wish to watch a woman do exactly what they’ve paid for without having to ask. Elowen did not hate them. She was good at hating worthy things and indifferent to things that wanted to be hated; this had saved her from some men and kept others close who had needed to be put to work. She ate politely because the day had used up all her appetite and left only reflex. It made her seem disciplined. The donors liked that. They told her she had her mother’s mouth and that the mouth had been a weapon in court, they meant it sweetly, they did not know that they were telling her the shape of her grief.

When they were gone and the dishes had been cleared and the courthouse had begun its night noise—a soft interior rain of old wiring and the theologies of mice—Magdalena cracked her knuckles delicately. “We will do it clean,” she said. “You will go on the radio with me tomorrow and the nice lady who says her name like a lemon slice will ask us whether we condone violence. You will say we condone vigilance. You will say the word neighbor, you will say the word memory, you will not say weather like it is a pet. People who have sweating jobs do not like it when you make the thing that kills their corn into verse.”

“And when she asks if I am the girl with the storm,” Elowen said, and the room went slightly wrong around the edges, as if a painting had been hung an inch askew. “When she asks it with that kind of smile. The one for women who do bad things interestingly.”

“You will say she is from our town in the oldest way,” Magdalena said. “By which you will mean: she is our fault and also our hard birthright. You will say you will bring her home if we are kind to her. You will not say what you will do if we are not. Let that sleep under the bed with the dust and the fear. People like a monster they think will eat someone else first.”

June had taken to cataloging the courthouse hallway while they talked, her fingers moving down the spines of the framed certificates like the blind practiced on justice. “There is a picture missing,” she observed into the room in what might have been her contribution to the plan or her rejection of it. “Where the wives are. Between Rosalind with the plaid and Christine with the hair. There is a blonde whose space is a rectangle of sunburn.”

“The nameless one,” Magdalena said, and every woman in the room felt the pronoun split and multiply like a fungus when it has the right log. “No one could get her to sit long enough to stay in frame. When she did, the glass did not keep her. We have an empty spot where she refused to be proof. The judge had it gilded to dignify his failure.”

“I want to talk to someone who saw her,” Elowen said, the ring pressing into her finger with the pressure of an aunt’s insistence. “Not the portrait. The woman. Someone who can tell me where she put her hands when she slept.”

June and Magdalena looked at each other with that brief, quarreled alliance that family makes around a child’s request. Magdalena acquiesced first because she understood napkins and knives and the need to have a witness who wasn’t going to write an invoice after. “Mae Ruth Lively,” she said. “She is in the building with the name they gave it when they wanted to avoid nursing home without having to raise anyone’s pay. She keeps a little box of nails in her bed because when she does not have the weight of metal on her she believes she floats away at night and wakes up in other people’s possibly-worse mornings. She served cakes at the judge’s second wedding. She called the first Mrs. Perfect and has been apologizing to no one in particular for it since. We will go after you are civil to the radio.”

“I am civil when I am not provoked,” Elowen said. “It’s the provoking everyone likes.”

Later, when the building slept in its municipal way and the siren practiced in its throat and stopped, when Jonah had gone to his mother’s house where the porch complained with love under his feet, when June had fallen asleep face-down on a grant application with one hand inside the pocket of her cardigan like a rabbit who learned to keep its ears warm, Elowen went down alone to the room with the glass. She did not bring the book; she did not bring a witness; she did not bring a gift. She told herself she was only visiting a mirror, which is what people tell themselves when they are about to attempt to love a thing that will not bend to their name for it.

The glass greeted her like a dog that recognizes the sound of your worst idea. She put the ring flat to it and felt the click that a lock makes when it has decided to be generous. The room made the particular dark that you remember from childhood when you woke in a place that did not know what to do with you. The glass did its slow unfurling. It is hard to write about that without reaching for water; it is harder to live it without letting a river in. A girl’s face came, but not in the neat shape of the earlier meeting; she arrived the way wind arrives in a cornfield, in sections and whispering more than one language, and Elowen realized with a private shame that she had been expecting the mercy of repetition.

“You look tired,” El said, as if sympathy could be a criticism that felt like a blanket. “You found your ring.”

“I found where I hid it,” Elowen said. The ring pulsed once, a cat stepping into and out of a lap. “I don’t know if that makes me clever or a thief I will one day have to arrest.”

“It makes you a person who thinks ahead when she is asleep,” El said. “I am trying to learn that. It is not my custom. I was made where sleep has knives in it.”

Elowen leaned her forehead to the glass and did not let the cold startle her. “Why the children,” she asked, and hated herself because the question was too big for two women in a noonless basement. “The posters. The scratched crowns. Why do they leave and then come home different or not at all? Is it us? Is it you?”

El watched her with a concentration that would have burned hair if this had been a more honest world. “The wind is a fair parent only when it is bored,” she said. “Whatever else, it is busy. When a girl’s hunger says take me somewhere that is not my father’s face, the wind will oblige if it is having a day where it wishes to be complimented. I do not set its appointments. Sometimes I am the appointment.” She closed her eyes and opened them again in a way that would have gotten her called witch in a town with more spare time. “Sometimes the river gets jealous of the road. Sometimes the glass which was supposed to remember only you remembers what it wants.”

“I told a name today,” Elowen said, thinking of Edda May’s hand rising like a weed committing to live. “We made a gate and gave a gift and found a witness. If I did it wrong, tell me and I will do the wrong thing better.”

“You did it with good hands,” El said. “Better than mine. I am a wrong thing that loves its wrongness and forgets to apologize. You walk where love is counted in the open and that gives you better lines to draw in the ground. Do not get proud. The next thing will want something you did not plan to give, and you will have to decide if you are the sort of woman who carries food to a wolf and writes a sermon about the ethics later.”

The glass quickened. This was a new motion. It felt like the world behind it taking a breath in front of Elowen’s ribs. The mirror was not a surface; it was a membrane. It pushed her forward gently the way a hand at a small of a back suggests dancing without insisting. She thought of the ring, tasted the tin of the handrail she had licked when she was eight because her mother had dared her to be brave and she had misunderstood the assignment, smelled smoke that belonged to a weather that had not yet paid for this room. El’s pupils widened to the size of night. “Not today,” Elowen said aloud, and the glass listened as if it had too often had to respect a boundary only because it feared someone else’s aunt.

In the morning they went to the radio station, which attempted to smell like coffee and hope and will always smell like old spit. The host wore a jacket the color of tomatoes and called Magdalena Your Grace with her mouth and called her Magda with her hands. There are kinds of women who are taken for granted and paid for; Magdalena was both. Elowen put on the headphones and they made her ears feel hugged and stupid. It was not unpleasurable. The red light went on the way lights do when they want to be loved for their clarity. The first question was the one that had been rehearsed and the second question was the one that had been paid for and the third question was a knife in a birthday cake. “People are frightened,” the host said, voice dampened into a persuasion that made the county feel like a warm church. “Are you frightened, Princess?”

“Yes,” Elowen said, because there are sins that taste like pennies and there are sins that taste like rosemary and this wasn’t either. “But it is not the fear you think. I am frightened of how beautiful we look to ourselves when we call someone enemy. I am frightened of my hands when they think they are the only way to hold the sky. I am frightened of the days when the bell rings wrong and we hear it and decide to clap because we like the theater.”

Magdalena’s eyebrow made a suggestion that felt like redirection. Elowen did not take it. She said the words responsible and neighbor and memory and made them taste like water that had boiled all morning on a back burner and been poured into clean cups. She said the train yard had nearly learned another grammar and they had taught it the old one again on purpose because there were children near nouns that was how she would describe it to anyone else.

“Would you speak,” the host asked, the lemon slice cutting her questions into neat coins, “to the name Princess Blackflower? Some are saying she is yours. Some are saying she is everyone’s and therefore God’s. Some are saying she is a blasphemy that should be cleaned off with the hose and then with the hose again.”

Elowen put her hands flat on the console because wood likes to be touched when you are about to lie and to be told you are not. “I do not know what that is,” she said, truth sitting up and stretching. “I know this: girls from here have always had to grow taller than the towns that raised them. When they cannot, the town gets the name, not the girl. I am mine. She is hers. The ring around my finger will not fit anyone else’s hand without pain. That is a kind of sacrament, sure, but also it is just how fingers work.” She could feel Magdalena’s satisfaction and irritation jostle for space in the chair next to hers and did not mind it; this was their relationship and it held, like a bridge built out of the wrong kind of wood that keeps refusing to break.

After, they walked through a parking lot that had known too many arguments not to know what to do with another. A woman in a sweatshirt with a wolf’s face that had been passioned into wisdom stopped them and squeezed Elowen’s forearm as if it she were checking ripeness. “You say pretty,” the woman said, not unkindly. “You better say it steady.” Elowen nodded and wanted to put her forehead against the wolf and rest for five minutes. People do not often allow this until you are dead.

They drove to the place with the name that was not nursing home. Jonah trailed them on his bicycle because he had been feeling like a boy with a purchased horse in a town that had replaced all its pastures with parking lots. The building had been built in the seventies by someone optimistic about brick and long windows. It always smelled like lemon and lint at the same time, as if someone had decided sunlight could be bought and then had been proved wrong and had decided to pretend otherwise anyway. Mae Ruth Lively waited in room 210 with a drawer of nails and a jar full of teeth time had told her were inappropriate to display. She wore her white hair like a crown that had gotten tired of sharpness and arranged itself to be forgiven.

“You aren’t the judge,” she said to Magdalena, and then, as an apology to her own mouth, “I always call you that when I mean something else. You look like a verdict when you stand by the window. It’s a compliment that isn’t good for children.” She turned her face toward Elowen, and her eyes, which had learned to be cruel when they needed to and had then retired, softened. “You used to be the river,” she said, delighted. “You wouldn’t sit. I made a lemon bar and you put it on the windowsill and forgot it and I watched the sugar grow a skin.”

“I need to borrow your remembering,” Elowen said, sitting on the edge of the bed because the chair with its plastic arms would have made her polite and she did not want to be for a minute. “The woman from the coast. The one with the mirror. The one who married your judge and made all of you new rules that were so good you had to pretend to hate them.”

Mae Ruth looked at the ceiling with disrespect, as if it were an old man who had insisted on telling his hunting story again. “She came with a trunk she didn’t carry and a pair of shoes she did,” she said. “She had a way of standing that made men think they had already said the wrong thing. She called the river my sister and the corn my son and the sky a liar. She would not sleep on your courthouse mattress because she didn’t like someone else telling her when to do the small deaths. She took it to the roof. I carried up a blanket and a plate of biscuits because it is my religion to dishonor other people’s religions when they inconvenience me. She took one and she fed it to the shell she took around for a ring.”

“She fed the ring,” June said, delighted at belief being made into bread. “That’s a trick every librarian wants for paper.”

Mae Ruth nodded, pleased to be of use, and reached into her drawer for a nail. It was the kind with a head too wide for pretty, hammered crooked once and then corrected by someone stubborn. “She wore this in her pocket so she had an edge when men shook her hand, so that she felt like her blood knew where to go. When people asked her name, she lied. When they asked her mother’s, she lied prettier. When they asked why the mirror only showed her when it wanted to, she told them the truth and said, because you don’t listen when women say no.” She looked at Elowen and patted her wrist where the ring had made a groove it would take a little life to smooth. “You listen like a bad dog,” she pronounced. “Which is to say, you listen to what you want to. That is a skill that can save you if you put a bird on it to make it look like an art.”

“What did she call the other inside her,” Elowen asked, because she would probably hate herself tonight for how greedy she had been with the old woman’s afternoon and she might as well have something to show the guilt.

“Her unking,” Mae Ruth said promptly. “Because sometimes a crowned thing is the last thing that can help you, and sometimes it is the first thing that takes the bread out of your mouth. Because sometimes you need to take off the head of the story to get its breath back. Because a word like that is a way to name the way women have been both allowed and not allowed to be people longer than anyone else, so we have had to learn to make ambidextrous mouths.” She sucked her teeth to get out a seed the lemon bar from twenty years ago had left there as a prank. “Because she liked to get away with the wrong thing in public where men were wearing hats.”

When they left, Jonah walked his bike into the parking lot and tried not to bleed on anyone’s sedan. The sky had that mild glare it gets in late afternoon when it is thinking about its commute. June carried Mae Ruth’s nail in her pocket because pockets are the only reliquary she had ever been able to afford. Magdalena stared out at the flag that had learned how to tangle itself expertly on its own rope. She said, to no one in particular and therefore to everyone, “If the pastor brings his people to our square, we will give them lemonade and awkward silences until they have to leave to pee. No one likes to riot when they’ve been hydrated.”

That evening, Pastor Invitational’s caravan ghosted through on the highway and then thought better and turned its signal on. Minivans with windows monogrammed in stick family decals blinked into town and lined themselves up like a kind of migrating bird that prefers lanes. Signs had been painted with quotations that looked good until you remembered they had been taken out of rooms where they had had other words to hold their hands. The bell, traitorous and busy, rang the three wrong strokes at six twenty and then tried to correct itself, and the out-of-towners cheered, because they thought this was about them. People did speeches with an urgency that would have been more appropriate at birth. Men of two sizes—huge and hungry—took positions near the courthouse steps and waited for someone to be an episode they could tell their grandchildren about with a self-pity that could still bench-press.

Magdalena coughed once, which in local dialect meant, I will begin. She started with a story about lemonade in the seventies tasting like pickles because the grandmother who had made it used the same jar and about how nobody died from it and it taught them to share. The caravan people looked confused and tired and then relieved when they realized they could be bored out of their purpose. Elowen stood one step behind and one step to the side and watched for a flicker in any reflective surface. She had, in the last day, become a person who checks every spoon for a prophesy.

El arrived, if she did, in a way only Elowen would have noticed. The air did not pause. It inclined its head. The paper cups on the table fluttered like pigeons in light wind. El’s presence had learned to be polite. It stood near the fountain where children put pennies and laws and watched Magdalena with that kind of fond contempt women save for other women who could have been their sisters if it had not been for men and geography. “You are doing theater,” El told Elowen in the place behind her left ear where the bone can carry a message without words. “It is nice. I never learned to like an audience that didn’t weep.”

“You will not pick a fight in front of children with signs,” Elowen said the words inside her mouth without moving it, and the ring warmed as if it had decided to be on her side for an afternoon. “You will not make their fathers feel powerful by giving them a job to do with their fists. Go find a field. Scare a deer. Throw lightning at a scarecrow. Practice. Be good. I will bring you lemonade later and we can hate each other in private if that is what you need to become me while I remain me.”

El laughed, and the fountain hiccuped. “We are getting along too well,” she said, and then was gone in that way that was not absence but refusal. The caravan moved on because anyone who has ever taken children to a different city knows that there will be a moment where you decide to go home to your own bathroom and your own kitchen and pretend the thing you wanted to change changed itself while you were busy. Men with signs wanted to linger and be asked to stay; Magdalena gave them a set of facial expressions that made them feel like they were late for something elsewhere they had promised to be and they drifted away, phones dark, hats committed to being hats.

That night, Springfield slept badly, which is to say it slept like every other night. Elowen woke twice, once because her aunt had a dream you could hear through walls, the kind with the breath that’s not quite crying, and once because something creaked upstairs with the intention of reminding her that the bell had patience and was older. Near dawn, before morning had gathered enough thoughts to push itself over the horizon, she walked back to the mirror room with her hair down and her bare feet remembering old layouts. The ring sat heavy on her finger and every step was a counting.

She brought a gift this time not because the book had told her to but because she had learned the day’s grammar. It was not the ring—she was not finished with that. She took the nail from June’s cardigan pocket where June had left it for her without saying so, because June believed in building the kind of trust that looks like theft. Elowen pressed the nail palm-ward and held it until her skin took a memory of its head. Then she set it on the iron frame next to the glass and let it roll into the groove where things go when they are committed to story.

“Gate,” she whispered, and turned her aunt’s keys in the lock with more noise than was polite. “Gift,” she said, and let go of the nail only after it had pinched. “Witness,” and she said her mother’s name for the first time in years without adding a title to make it easier to swallow. The mirror woke obediently. El came like a rumor coming home from work.

“I wrote out how to tell people it is not you,” Elowen said because courage sometimes wears paperwork. “Tomorrow the mayor of a smaller town will invite us to dedicate a gazebo because he thinks sanctity can be installed by an outlet. I will go and I will look like calm. My aunt will speak to the donors and keep our ambulances purchased. We will be good and boring and the radio will find someone else to salt. In the cracks, you ought to teach me how to unclench the air without choking it first.”

“You say ought as if it is a sacrament,” El said, amused and tired. “All right. You will learn. You should know that every time you unclench a thing, something else will seize. This is a body. It will never be all loose. The trick is to decide what you are willing to cramp.”

Elowen nodded as if she were promising to carry a child a long way on her back through heat. She reached toward the glass and this time their hands did not try to match. The contact that had been forbidden decided to be possible not because the rules had changed but because they had learned to begrudge them with enough grace to make room. Her fingers were cold where El’s were warm. The ring hurt her, a new good pain. Smoke rose from somewhere far and inland. The bell did not ring; it waited. Elowen thought of Mae Ruth’s drawer of nails, of the brooch soaking in a tanker's puddle, of June asleep with her hand on a book to make sure knowledge did not walk away in its sleep, of Jonah standing in a doorway choosing not to become his absence of a father. The glass was only the way a door learns humility. She leaned in, and it did not break.6

They practiced at dawn behind the feed mill because dawn is the hour when even the machines agree to be a little equivocal. The grain elevators rose like a set of fat white fingers laid palm-up to swear a half-truth. The frost, such as it was in late summer’s economy of mercy, had come down during the hours when men who carry sacks dream with their hands clenched, and now it feathered the stubble of the lot and the low weeds with a particular bravery. The wind lay down where Jonah had parked the truck, as if it meant to be carried. “She says,” Elowen told the air, and June and Jonah had learned not to ask who she was when the sentence began that way, “that I have to feel for the hinge in a day. She says the mistake is to try to lock or unlock, that the trick is to find the place where the door knows it could do either and then to offer it a reason to choose.” She had slept a few hours and woken with the flavor of iron used for a familiar rather than a cage, and the mirror’s coolness still on her forehead made everything outside feel more honest than it wanted to be.

El’s voice came not as sound but as a scrape of intention against Elowen’s shoulder-blade, the way a cat you don’t own tests whether your kindness is a story you tell or a hand you use. “You always go for the big muscle,” she chastened, not unkindly. “Stop trying to lift the day with your back. Bend your knees. Put your mouth where the hinge is.” June clucked her tongue and found the passage in the municipal book with diagrams for breath that assumed a city has lungs. “‘Hinge may be located in gates, throats, barndoors, courthouse entries, rusted swings, soft women,’” she read, pleased with the list’s refusal to prioritize. “‘It is commonly found where use has made a groove.’”

“Gates,” Jonah muttered, warming his hands around the thermos as if coffee had promised him once not to leave. He wore the kind of gloves that make men look like they still do childhood in the winter. “You keep saying this word and it becomes a carton instead of a fact.”

Elowen crouched to look at the frost without apologizing to her dress. Her knees had learned the floor of her aunt’s office too well to object to gravel. She exhaled, very gently, and tried to see if she could make the breath sound like choosing. Somewhere close to the ground, she felt it. The air had a seam at the level where children kneel to peer under fences. It resisted slightly when she moved her hand through it, the way a cheap book jacket resists just before the library tape finally lays flat. “Here,” she said, and June nodded solemnly like a saint shown a new relic. El taught her without stepping into the light, exactly the way an aunt teaches without admitting she is pleased. “Offer it a gate,” El said, and Elowen, without thinking too much lest the thought notice it was being used as a tool, took Jonah’s stop sign that had been knocked from its post in a storm and set against the wall years ago because no one could agree whether it belonged to the city or to God. She planted it upright in the tire ruts in a way that let its red face pretend it had always been meant to hang in midair. “Gift,” El said, and Elowen hesitated because nothing felt expendable when you were tired and being useful for once. In the end she unclipped the small charm from the inside of her jacket—the one June had pressed on her two winters ago, a library card hole-punched to look like a heart—and set it at the foot of the gate. It looked not like a sacrifice but like a child’s pride. “Witness,” El said, and Elowen named the creek her mother had taught her to cross on stones when she was small, the one with the stone that had sat still so long it had hollowed in the middle like a grandmother’s lap. “Crayfish Run,” she said, and the frost around her fingers stood up into attention the way hair stands when a storm regards you and decides to practice first.

For a moment the whole lot held its breath with superstition, and then the frost unspooled just where she asked it to. A path melted between old plow tines and a discarded window frame caked in bird lime. The dew stood on the standing weeds like lamp chains cut to length and waiting for their owner to return from a cigarette. A low wind pushed itself through because it realized it could, and Elowen felt at the same time the temptation to take all the breath and the instruction not to. The work felt like holding a toddler as it learns stairs—your hands above the ribs, not lifting, just present, ready to keep a skull from meeting merciless geometry. “There,” El said, and if a woman could pat a woman without the business of skin, that is what the sense did. “Now let it pull away and forgive you for telling it a story.”

She did. The frost fell together again where it hadn’t been asked to stand up. It kept a few lines where it wanted to be vain—that is a rule of the world as hard as tax law—but it went back to being what it was: the day’s apology for last night’s imprecision. June drew the hinge on paper with an arrow that looked as if the arrow wanted to be a vein. Jonah wiped his nose with the back of his hand like a schoolboy and tried to look uninterested in the fact that someone he loved could now tell the air where to stand as if it were a dog.

They walked along the railroad after, just to make the day feel less like a church, and El drifted only as close as the reflection in a shop window would allow. Elowen was alert to her the way you are alert to the presence of your own shadow when a man you do not trust walks too close; she did not feel invaded so much as bracketed. At the edge of the yard where the cars had sat yesterday like a neat apocalypse, a pair of switchmen smoked and told each other their shame in the language of men who would rather call friendship a shift. They nodded to Elowen with a careful courtesy they had not learned from television, the kind you use for women who might save you later and who might also close their hands and make a noise you can’t climb out of. “You the river,” one asked, almost shy. “Or that other one who made my teeth stand up in my head.”

“I’m learning how to be both our aunt’s problem and our town’s,” she said, and the men laughed too loudly and were grateful when the bird that had misjudged yesterday’s wing-beat hopped on the rail like a ridiculous forgiveness.

Magdalena found them before nine, as she always found what she needed before anyone else remembered it was necessary. She sat in the truck bed like a woman who had been a queen in a story that had lost its money and made do with duct tape and write-offs. “We are going to Honeysuckle,” she informed them, which is what the smaller town insisted on being called although no one had seen a honeysuckle in its limits in three commercial developments. “They have built a gazebo with grant money and pride and they want to launder both by having you bless it. It will be an excuse to speak to the men who think they have votes in their pocket the way other men carry knives. It will be an opportunity to be seen by the kind of people you forget to remember when you write speeches about weather.” She assigned them their roles with the kind of speed that makes kindness into a weapon used gently. June would carry the book but not show it. Jonah would hold the ribbon across the steps and cut it if Elowen couldn’t make the scissors behave. Elowen would wear the suit that had made the donors so emotional they had reached for their checkbooks as if the deep pockets meant magnanimity.

Honeysuckle was three towns over and one industry ago. Its main street had the kind of painted brick that pretends it will last longer than the people who have to drive past it when they forget to say I love you and go to work anyway. The gazebo sat in the square as if it believed in itself. It was the kind of octagon people tell jokes about when they wish to be cruel about the working class and also crave somewhere decent to kiss. It had a copper roof that had not yet learned how to turn green politely. The mayor had a name that sounded like a family had built it and blond hair that looked as if it had been spun in a dryer with a can of lemonade mix. He shook Magdalena’s hand while his eyes darted to Elowen’s pin, found the absence of the brooch, and decided to overlook it the way small men decide to overlook a hurricane.

“We are so proud,” he said. “You all being here and what happened at the yard and your aunt’s thermometer of a moral compass and all. We heard about that preacher bringing his mess through your town and you being as gracious as pie. We got some of his cousins here if you want to say something to them that will make them come back every month for the next six years.” He tried to laugh and the laugh did not belong to his face.

Elowen smiled in a way that made him stop looking at her mouth as if it were made to contain forgiveness. She walked up the three shallow steps and put both hands on the rail, which someone had stained last night with a devoutness that could have been used at the birth of a child. In the reflection on the copper she saw El, briefly, looking bored in the way of women who love hard work and politics not at all. “Friends,” she said, and the word tasted like she had meant it when she chose it. “I have never trusted gazebos. They’re just porches that refuse to commit. But I do like a place meant for songs, and I have never found a square that did not need a spot where young people could not see their parents for five minutes.”

If the morning had ended there, it would have been admirable. The ribbon would have been cut with the municipal scissors after someone remembered to leave the zip tie on to show a kind of respect. The men from the pastor’s caravan would have driven home early in trucks with deer stenciled on the back windows and boasted that the princess had eyes like a trouble they could forgive in a housebroken dog. Instead the day had decided to be an old man with too many tricks and a pride that meant to kill him. The wind came from the south in the way it does when it has eaten dust and wants to make other mouths try it, and the small spiral that forms because physics is not personal hooked itself on the nails and screws scattered in the parking lot where the hardware store had a habit of leaking. It made a sound like a hundred comets changing their mind at once. It grew not big, exactly, but precise. You could have thrown your hat into it and made someone’s widow a different kind of story. Men at the edge of things took their feet back up onto the curb as if they had all trained together to pretend they were not frightened.

El said, very quietly and very fondly, “Congratulations, you have a trick. Try not to let it show your slip.” Elowen did not ask what the trick was; the book had told them and the yard had told them and the ring was telling her now by warming the second knuckle as if it wanted to own the finger. She set her hand flat against the gazebo rail and felt for the hinge, not in the air this time but in the town itself. Honeysuckle had two hinges she could reach without breaking herself open: the carousel at the far end of the square that some civic donation had bought from an amusement park that had died in the year of the third divorce, and the whistle on the water tower that a man pulled to call volunteer firemen with the grim joy reserved for men who get to rescue neighbors and also see the insides of things. “Gate,” she said in her throat, and tipped her head toward the carousel. “Get it moving. Wrong rhythm. Don’t make it pretty. Make it persuasive.”

Jonah had already started to run because he had been training to be asked for twenty years. He jumped the low chain, startled the bored teenage attendant into an octagon of apologies, and threw the switch that brought the heavy animals to life with the surly yawns of creatures that do not enjoy being woken and will still work because it is the right thing to do. He slapped the switch down and up again in a pattern no fairground would allow, a three-beat that put a stammer into the horse’s gallop and made the swan look like it was thinking about walking for the first time in its life. The calliope coughed. The carousel horn bucked. The mothers who had come to see the ribbon cutting looked at one another as if to confirm there was still a universe, however theatrical. Elowen held the gate by its hinge the way you hold your jaw when you want to tell the truth and you know it will make someone leave.

“Gift,” El said mildly, and Elowen closed her fingers around her wrist where the fresh scrape lay and pressed until the new skin opened just enough to remember. She did not like to perform for crowds, but sometimes a small blood is the cleanest price. She set her palm flat on the copper roof edge where the heat gathered and said her mother’s name again, this time not as witness but as an offering that she did not plan to be thanked for. “Witness,” June murmured, and she had, despite her librarian’s strictness, palmed the city records from the bag and flipped to the page where the first man to hammer true in Honeysuckle had written his initials and then his wife’s shoe size because he had been someone who learned by measuring. “Amos Bridgeman,” June read into the wind because the wind needed to be told a human name to lower its pride. “You drove a carriage into the river and walked the horse out by its lips and lost your hat and never told and built the gazebo we tore down and told your grandson never to put his hands where a belt turns. Today you owe me your hammer arm.” She rarely asked men for anything out loud. The air paused in that dog-polite way that means it will be obedient and also mischievous.

The dust devil had been trying to be someone else’s god. Nails went end over end like elegant threats. Screws wrote little essays about torque. The copper edge where Elowen had bled took the story down a rung. The spiral tried to hook itself onto a reason to become and, failing to be given back its favorite excuse, swayed and petered out in a sulk. A handful of screws fell and bounced under the police cruiser where they would stay for years and puncture exactly one tire the day a man needed to get his wife to an appointment for a diagnosis he had been avoiding. A boy with a face like the moon in a funhouse mirror clapped because he thought the whole thing had been the plan. The men with ties looked disappointed in the way men do when someone refuses to become their entertainment.

After, the mayor shook Elowen’s hand eagerly and managed not to look at the blood with his mouth. “You are everything they say you are,” he said, and it was impossible to tell whether he meant the compliments or the warnings. “We have an opening in kind of a position that might interest you if you get tired of your aunt. We could pay you a stipend and let you name things.” He said this as if naming were a hobby she would be flattered to practice professionally on a smaller canvas. Magdalena cut in before Elowen had to be clever. “The things name themselves better when the person who used to love them is nearby,” she said sweetly. “Your gazebo will be proud to hear people fight under it, and that is the only budget line that will matter in three years.”

They drove back in a mood that was not victory and not not. El was not in the glass because the day had decided to let Elowen carry a thing on her own and had not yet handed it off; a small mercy disguised as work. June fell asleep in the back seat propped against the book like it had been made to be a pillow when municipal wisdom had been a little taller. Jonah flicked the turn signal at empty fields because he had learned to respect simple machines who had not asked to be blamed for anyone’s death. “I have a theory,” he offered, squinting into a road that had decided to go straight until it remembered a grandmother who needed visiting. “You know how your ring makes you sure your hand is your hand. What if there’s a same kind of thing for our town. Not a ring, exactly. Something that has the weight where people agree to be people with each other. If El takes it off too often, the wind thinks it can run the meetings.”

“El has not taken anything from us that we didn’t toss in the river first,” Elowen said, but it came out like a confession and not like a defense. The ring had been hot as sugar under a spoon during the dust devil and now it settled into a warmth so companionable she wanted to tell it a story. She had learned that morning in Mae Ruth’s doorway that her mother’s friend had hidden nails in her bed to keep from floating away, and she felt the ring, for the first true time, as something other than jewelry; she felt it as a nail she had been allowed to hold in public without being called dangerous.

In the afternoons when politics had been satisfied and towns had been pacified and the bell had decided to challenge faith in small ways, Magdalena retreated to a room in the courthouse with no window and a painting of a fruit bowl by someone who had never seen fruit. Elowen found her there with her hair down in a way that made the building think for a second it had become a house. “You’re very good,” the Regent said, meaning this morning and radio and train yard and maybe being alive. “You’re good in the way that is expensive to keep. It would be useful for you to consider what you will give up regularly so that we may plan the budget of your miracles.” It was hard to tell if she meant money or skin.

Elowen sat on the edge of the desk and took a bite of the apple in the bowl as if it were not stage dressing. It was wax and of course it was wax and the satisfaction of the lunatic bite steadied her as if she had been the audience for her own joke. “You want me to be less of a storm,” she said. “You want me to talk of it differently. You want me to use smaller words so the men who sell asphalt can pretend we’ve agreed there won’t be wind.”

“I want you to last,” Magdalena said. “We have built this family so that it rests on one woman’s back at a time. It is an atrocious engineering and we have done it brilliantly. Your mother was an animal designed for war. I have been a calculator whose buttons never stuck. You” — and here her voice did a small mercy with itself and softened — “are a knife with a handle. You have to be the sort of tool that can be put down. We will train the hand that holds you. If you insist on being an explosion, we’ll be very modern and film you and then we will have to bake casseroles for your aunt’s friends.”

That evening a boy was missing from the far south end, a boy with a throat that had learned to imitate five different birds and who had once let Elowen listen to him make rabbit sounds until she cried with laughter that tasted like salt and early summer. His name was Benito Otter, because sometimes parents make a joke out of fear and then continue to love the joke until it becomes a man. His grandmother called the courthouse and the courthouse called Jonah because he could be trusted to move without a committee and Magdalena looked across the hall at Elowen because she could be trusted to move without asking whether the road would like to be thanked. June looked down at the book because she had learned to be useful more quietly. El had learned the trick of not being the first voice and waited under the bridge that had always been there even when people decided not to use it.

The river at dusk had the posture of a tall girl holding in her stomach so that a dress would do her a favor. Fireflies began to sell their electric checks, and boys who had not yet learned to be embarrassed about joy had run in the park and shouted and men had told them to knock it off out of habit as old as wheat. Benito’s grandmother stood on the bank with her arms crossed and her mouth set the way mouths do when prayer has been used up and replaced with an older, uglier yes. “He went to call a bird and forgot he had feet,” she said. “He goes along the culvert because he says the echoes make a second throat so he can be two blackbirds at once and the second blackbird will laugh at him if he doesn’t get the words right.” She did not apologize for how foolish it sounded.

The trick with culverts is that they are the exact kind of hinge certain kinds of wind like to court. They are purpose married to dirt. Elowen could hear the hum the way a mechanic hears a car pull into the lot and knows from the pitch of the right front tire that the driver brakes with only the left foot when she is angry. El and Elowen do not always agree about when to touch. Tonight was not argumentative. It was merely necessary. “Gate,” El said like a woman untucking her hair before sleep and Elowen slid on her belly to the mouth of the culvert with the gracelessness of someone who had not had time to learn to care what she looked like. “The water,” June said, fishing inside the book with one hand and splashing at the culvert mouth with the other because sometimes a librarian has to be a child in order to take a sentence from its shelf. “It’s slow like cough syrup. We can ask it to pick up its feet.”

El didn’t always like rivers. They were older. They made her listen to their rules. But she was fair when she learned. “Find me a second throat,” El instructed, and Jonah, whose fatherlessness had made him believe in boyish inventions, was already in the park kiosk where the ranger sold sour candy and borrowed fishing lines, and he had the understanding with the ranger that men have with one another when they have kept hands out of one another’s pockets while stealing together from a larger, universal moral bank. He came up with a bullhorn whose batteries had been leaning toward death for a while. “Witness,” June said, lying on her back on the grass to look at the underside of the culvert like a ceiling and name the men who had installed it in a rainstorm when a flood had taken the chicken coop and someone’s vow and six orange cones. “Henderson Lewis. Rafael Parker. Peanut McCrawnley,” she said, and Peanut, who had been dead long enough to forgive the wrongness of the name, sent his shrug back down through steel.

Elowen put the bullhorn to her mouth and did not speak, which is a kind of speaking that the right kind of pipe understands. She held it out to the culvert instead and let the old scrape of battery acid and spit reach in and make a yellowed chapel of the inside. The wind that had been hiding, practicing itself into a boy’s lungs, heard the other throat and had the decency to be a little embarrassed. “Gift,” El said, and Elowen took off her shoe. It was one of the stupid heels she wore when Magdalena wanted her to look like she would never again run down stairs. She tossed it into the culvert with a disgust that might have been prayer. The river snapped it up like a coin and swallowed. The second throat burped. Benito Otter’s bird call broke in the middle the way a boy’s call will break when it realizes it wants to be a man’s, and then he coughed. He crawled out with knees that had met every rock in the county and a mouth so green with culvert that he looked for a second like a joke about envy. His grandmother fell upon him with her mouth set still and the old yes becoming a newer one.

“Stop doing that,” she told him with more love than the river itself had ever mine-d for anyone, and Benito nodded, young enough to intend obedience and old enough to fail because boys are boys. “Say thank you,” she added as an afterthought born of a century. He did. He said it to Elowen as if she were a person who took cash. He said it to June because she was a woman who could hold a book where people were drowning and not smirk. He said it to Jonah because he was a man and boys who can say thank you to men survive most of the time. He said it to the water like it was a dog, and the water, contemptuous and ancient, pretended not to listen and listened anyway.

The bell rang at an hour when no honest bell has a right. It did not do the wrong three. It rang once, and the once was so clean that men who had cheated on their wives put down the cups they were holding as if the noise had caught them. Elowen looked upward through the leaves of the sycamores, which are kind trees who like to be praised for their patchy bark the way men like to be praised for changing a tire. In the pane of the courthouse clock, the glass held her face and something behind it for a breath longer than reflection. El, amused and affectionate and increasingly impatient with mortality, said, “There are bigger names above us.” This was not news in the way that taxes are not news. It still made the lower back of Elowen’s heart ache. “They are watching the way wolves watch deer at the edge of a forest that has not yet been invented. They think we are arguing about who gets to eat the wind. We are not. We are arguing about who has to swallow the day’s pride and not choke.”

They did not sleep early. They ate the kind of sandwiches you eat when you do not want to be caught cooking. June read the book aloud on the porch because words behave differently in humid air. Magdalena made three calls to people who liked to be told they were needed. She said three different truths that learned to hold hands halfway through the second sentence, a near miracle she had taught herself the same year she had taught herself to pull her own molar in a hotel bathroom with a pair of pliers and a single shot of bourbon because she had not had time to be a person with a pain. Jonah sat on the edge of the porch with his feet in the flowerbed trampling the impatiens in a way that felt honest to them. Elowen went and sat on the courthouse steps where she had learned to keep her face’s accidents to herself, and when she leaned back and closed her eyes the ring cooled the way a stone cools on the river bank when it remembers it is not a fish.

“Practice,” El said, which is both a command and the invitation you give a child when you hand them a knife and watch the way their wrists learn. “Not because performance is coming. Because habit is the only mercy your body grants itself.” Elowen lifted her hand. The night had a hinge where yes becomes morning. She touched it with two fingers. The map of her town unfolded in her mouth. She could taste which streets had already decided to be wrong in the morning. She could taste which fields were figuring out whether to fail big or small. She could taste a man in a trailer seventeen miles south who was going to decide to keep his gun given one more humiliation, and she felt the humiliations line up like cans on the rail, waiting to be knocked down by boys who have discovered physics and cruelty at the same time. “I won’t be able to pull against all of that,” she said into her hands as if they were a priest. “I need the same kinds of hinges where men live.”

“They have hinges,” El said, and there was pity in it, which made Elowen resent her and love her with the precision of a needle. “It is not your job to open or close them. It is your job to announce which ones are not the town’s business. Your aunt will tell you that announcing is a kind of knife. She is right. Use it slowly. Use it only on holidays.”

Morning came like a decision. There was a new missing poster in the alley with the crowns scratched and unscratched and scratched again until the paper gave up and peeled. There was a letter addressed to Elowen from the pastor down south written on stationery that had little doves in the corner as if the paper had been to seminary on its own. It invited her to debate on a stage he could afford whose lights had already forgiven him for everything he meant to say. Magdalena put the letter in her pocket without reading it because she preferred to wage war with men while looking something true in the eye. “You will say no,” she said. “We will make lemonade for the people who drive past to find the next fight. We will send June to steal all the wiring diagrams for the megaphones from the internet. We will ask Jonah to fix the bell so it fails more interestingly. We will put on our best blouses and stand in front of the courthouse and call the wind by a pet name until it forgives us for saddling it with so many metaphors.”

It was then that the river, traitorous and loyal, decided to try a trick of its own. It ran backward for five minutes. No one noticed and everyone noticed. Men spitting into it hit themselves in the throat. Catfish turned in their slow insolence to face the other way. The sound it made was not like a reversal so much as like a sigh. “It is older than you,” El said, amused and grave. “Respect of elders is often a misused idea. Use it now.” Elowen stood on the bank, took off her shoes so she would not fall in love with an illusion of politeness, and bowed. Not to the water. To the wrongness. It stayed five beats longer and then, smug and tired and real, let itself go where it was going. She stood for one beat more just to remind it she did not come when called and left when told. The ring was quiet for once. The bell did not ring and then, when it did, it rang wrong on purpose. The whole town laughed at the same time not because it was funny but because continuing to breathe with your neighbors after a day like that requires an excuse, and God is generous with them when you make them yourself.By afternoon the town had installed a new kind of quiet, the kind that lies down polite as a quilt and then keeps opening one eye because it has dreams with teeth. The radio lost interest for an hour and found it again like a boy who can’t keep from poking a bruise; the pastor’s caravan appeared in someone’s story as a miraculous deterrent against mildew; the women who ran the diner experimented with lemonade made from limes, declaring it modern and untrustworthy in the same breath. Elowen walked the courthouse halls with her shoes in her hands because she had promised herself three minutes every day without noise, and Magdalena let her have it, pacing in the next room like a rich clock that refused to be wound by anyone else. The bell did not ring at four and then, because spite makes servants of iron, rang at four-oh-three and then again at four-oh-seven with the stubborn irregularity of a heart that had decided beauty could be its excuse for failing.

The bigger names made themselves known not as men in suits or storms with radio in their hair but as a slight pressure behind the eyes, a feeling like grammar checking its pockets. El, amused and contemptuous and trying very hard to be helpful without admitting she would prefer to be pure, sent a sentence across Elowen’s left lung like a postcard. They’re coming, she said, which could have meant any number of armies. They will call themselves continuity and safety and relief. They will name the mirror a hazard and you a reservoir. If you hand them either, they will leave you just enough rope to hang a polite banner from the courthouse steps.

They came, of course, though not in a parade anyone would admit to enjoying. Two black SUVs glided to the curb outside the library with the thick quiet of machines that have learned to practice wealth at home in the garage. A woman in a blazer the color of lawsuits and a man with a smile that believed kitsch could save us both presented badges with acronyms that added up to a faith in vowels. The woman introduced herself as Calder Vane, which felt like a lie married to a beautiful truth, and informed Magdalena that the Department of Continuity had taken an interest in Springfield’s recent innovations regarding atmospheric governance. The man did hand motions over the words like a magician who believed the velvet was doing most of the work. He asked to see the mirror in a tone that confused courtesy with inevitability.

Magdalena put on her face for men who believed themselves adjectives. She ushered them into the side meeting room where committees went to die and budget lines learned to marry men with pensions, and she smiled just enough to make them forget that a smile is a kind of bared teeth. She said they were welcome to drink her coffee and scent her chairs with cologne and leave their cards on a saucer, and of course they could tour the building later, after they had signed the ledger that made the government admit it had borrowed from a small woman’s afternoon. Calder Vane said the right words about partnership and resilience and fragility-as-strength which are the sort of words men in cardigans teach men in blazers if given a weekend and a stipend. Elowen stood in the doorway with June’s book tucked under her arm like a family Bible and watched the woman’s hands, which were careful and empty.

June moved like a rumor you hear while shelving biographies and took the mirror out the old back, tucking it under her cardigan like a teenager stealing sheet music. The trick of the mirror, they had decided, was that it looked like a cheap antique when it felt like being left alone and like a hole into a second honesty when attended by someone with the right kind of ring. She walked it through the alley where the missing posters had acquired new crowns and new scratches and new rain, and she carried it into the children’s room where a mural of a lion that looked like a housecat with opinions had been supervising naps for thirty years. She leaned the mirror behind the puppet theatre. The theatre had a wooden sheep with one ear, a cardinal with a look of permanent alarm, and a dragon made by a man in 1982 who had wanted to be paid for painting instead. The mirror leaned there and became harmless satin.

Calder Vane made her offer in the room with the stackable chairs. The offer was a promise of funds that would arrive in boxes of forms while requiring no signatures from Elowen herself, which was a kindness of a certain genre. The trade was simple as a fairy tale and twice as insulting: surrender the mirror for study, accept the installation of a field team who would help Springfield coordinate its relationship with wind in a way that respected interstate commerce, and invite the Department to host a symposium in the square on modern mythic management with panelists who had never missed a flight. Magdalena accepted the coffee, placed it precisely on the coaster, and asked if Calder either had children or borrowed them. When told that she had neither time nor a uterus that respected budget cycles, Magdalena nodded and said the kind of sentence that earns women more enemies than lies ever do. Then you will not take the child we made because you will not know where to put it when it cries at night.

Elowen learned a lot from her aunt’s fight—how to refuse without satisfying the enemy’s sense of abandonment, how to sell cooperation like absolution, how to stall while the librarian moved the holy thing—but she also felt the old itch in her fingers, the one that said this would go faster if you lifted something heavy with your wrong muscles. El hummed almost kindly, reminding her that lifting heavy can break a back, and backs are necessary even for women who prefer to hold the wind by its eyes. The bell above them made a click like an old man clearing his throat to allow other people to resume talking, and the town sighed with the relief reserved for small salvations that happen while men are using acronyms as weapons.

By early evening, after Calder Vane had been escorted to three unnecessary tours of the gazebo in Honeysuckle and had left behind slick paper promising a future in which all weather would be as obedient as faculty meetings, the bell decided to confess. It rang its wrong three, then a fourth that might have been an apology or a dare, and then a small crack that was not a sound and was not sight either moved spider-silk thin through the bronze, and you could feel the town put a hand to its chest as if to check that the jewelry there was decorative and not a shackle. Men who had been saving for snowblowers looked up as if the price of milk had doubled one more time for disrespect. Jane from the bakery walked to the courthouse with her apron still on and held up a roll like an offering. The bell did not ring again. Silence took its shoes off and sat in the pew of the square.

The old rules said this was a time for experts. The older rules said this was a time for women. Magdalena took the steps lightly as a judge in a hymn and then stepped aside. She had learned too well that part of her genius was not eating the bread that belonged to another mouth. Elowen felt the town listen to her body before it listened to her mouth. She climbed the stair no child had ever climbed in front of so many people and put both hands on the beam where the bell’s rope lived like an artery. Up close, the bell smelled like pennies and old sweat and weddings. The crack was small as sorrow. The urge to fix it with a nail was strong and stupid. June had brought the box Mae Ruth loved, the nails laying there like tiny arguments, and Elowen did not touch them yet. She laid her ear to the bell as you lay your ear to a child’s chest not for love but for diagnosis.

El said nothing for a long half-minute because there are moments when even a wrong girl knows not to speak simply because she can. The air around the bell held itself in the polite discipline of a congregation who suspects the homily will be good and therefore wants to give it a chance. Elowen felt the hinge not in the bell itself but in the town’s listening. The gift wanted would not be blood or jewelry; it wanted a form of public embarrassment. She closed her eyes, and then opened them because some rituals cannot be performed blind, and she said the names of the misrung days—each day when the bell had told time the way an uncle tells jokes, badly and loudly, and each day the town had decided to let themselves be late together because it was better than being anyone’s idea of perfect. She said the day of the parade when the rope had slipped. She said the night of her mother’s accident when the bell had been ready to announce something and the men had decided to keep the rope wound one more hour, to give the town sleep as if sleep were later convertible to kindness. She said the morning of Edda May’s return, and the bronze shivered because a single boy had been a hinge, modest as a nickel.

They did not mend the crack. They didn’t have gold or the arrogance to believe beauty could cure utility. Instead they voted by the old method. Magdalena met Elowen’s eyes, and June whispered only one word—Ready—and Jonah nodded in his strange, dear way, which looks like a man accepting a cup of something hot he has not earned. Elowen told the town that the bell would never be right again, and that was the point. It had joined them in the business of imperfect declarations. They would count their days by its wrongness and correct for love. A man in the back who had never agreed with a woman in his life wept once without looking at anyone, and everyone got to pretend they hadn’t noticed. Jane from the bakery came up and kissed the bronze with a cake-burnt lip and left a tiny pattern of sugar where there should have been polish. The silence changed its position on the bench. It wasn’t quite comfortable, but it stopped being a stranger.

The next morning came with a decision tucked in its sleeve like a schoolyard note. Calder Vane’s department had petitioned in the night, via email and secretary and a man with a ceremonial pen, to seize the mirror as part of an emergency inventory of mythic artifacts that had proliferated inconveniently since a certain cathedral had coughed on live television. Magdalena sat with the letter as if it were a roast she intended to carve so thin no one would leave hungry. She wrote back with the kind of economy that raises eyebrows and blood pressure. She did not say no. She proposed a visit from a federal historian of women’s objects. She proposed a tour of local hinges. She proposed lunch with Jane. She proposed a public conversation about public things at a table the town already owned. In the space where a refusal would have enraged a man who believed refused women ought not to be in the room, she stacked decency until the man had to invent a better sin to forgive. Elowen admired it with the kind of awe you save for instruments you do not have the patience to learn.

June, meanwhile, had written a grant application in the hour after dawn that disguised a territorial theft as an oral-history project. She had collected names of mothers who taught daughters how to weather a county budget, names of boys who had been scolded by grandmothers for whistling at wind, names of nails found in dresser drawers and wielded like rosaries. She stapled the application into a folder with a spray of violets on the front and wrote in the margin, as if to herself, later: We are not preserving. We are teaching. The ring on Elowen’s finger pulsed to the rhythm of the fountain’s cough in the square, which may or may not have been coincidence, which in Springfield means it was exactly on purpose and no one planned it.

“Are you going to leave,” Jonah’s mother asked him that afternoon in the doorway of their house where the paint cracked like lake ice. She asked it the way women who gave birth in winter ask things—briskly, so the heat doesn’t escape. Her hands were in a bag of rice for no reason other than the rice had been cheap and she liked the way it carried weight. She looked at him in that kind way that knows what a man is about to disappoint and loves him without forgiving it. “Boys who love important girls come home with their ears ringless,” she added, as if earrings were a talisman against bad futures. “I’d like to be wrong.”

Jonah sat on the steps the way he had when he was twelve and maintained that he could see over the hill if he squinted hard enough and built his eyes into periscopes. “I’m going with them,” he admitted, which she had known, and he said it with the softness of the kind of boy who tells the truth to women because he has seen what lies cost them. “Not because she asked. Because she forgets in the small hours that she is a person and not a parade banner. Someone has to carry water that isn’t speech.” His mother nodded as if this had been the answer she had raised him to give and then slapped him gently twice on the face for luck, which is a practice as old as grain. She handed him a tin with screws in it and told him not to let anyone sell his tools for love.

They packed as if packing were a ritual of refusal. Magdalena held the door open and put things into their hands not because she thought they would be enough but because women who do not give the right objects to the right people sleep badly. She gave Elowen a folded paper covered in her small controlled hand, a writ signed in ink that had run out too early, authorizing the bearer to borrow the town’s authority in the matter of storm, river, and public virtue. It was both joke and jurisdiction. She gave June a pair of wire cutters that had belonged to a loathed uncle who had taught her that a woman can cut power as easily as she provides it. She gave Jonah a small Bible that had belonged to no one important and was full of flattened grass and phone numbers. “This one is for when you have to look police in the face,” she said. “Men in blue still believe a certain shape of leather gives you a reason to be on a road.”

They took the late train west, because west had become the word everyone used for trouble whether or not the map scrubbed its hands afterward. The platform had that male smell public places get at night—beer, security guard bravado, the ghost of piss scrubbed out of stone by a woman who didn’t get paid enough. June carried the mirror in a feed sack with a cow printed on it who had been named Louise by a child with a marker, and whenever the train moved wrong between stations the mirror shivered the way a dog does when a sleep is interrupted by a coat thrown without warning. Elowen sat with her knees against the seat in front and her hands on her legs like someone practicing for court. She had not told El what she meant to do. Not telling an inner weather your intentions is a kind of prayer; it is also a kind of betrayal. The ring warmed and then was still.

They passed a grain elevator that looked like a cathedral learning humility, and then three get-rich-late lots where men had tried to sell the land to men from elsewhere who had called and been polite and not called and then had died of something other than their own lies. The conductor came by with his squinted kindness and asked for tickets in a voice that apologized for existing. Elowen handed him the writ instead by accident and he handed it back with the careful blink of a person who has learned to mistake paper for bullets. June started to laugh, and then did not, and then put the book on the table between them like a fourth companion, and the men across the aisle who had been trying not to stare at Elowen’s face decided she was a librarian after all and looked away, relieved and suspicious.

El, quiet now because movement is a kind of courtesy, let her lean into the window and fog it with an old childhood mouth. The dark outside was not blank. It was full of things that had learned to be wolves because deer are exhausting. Towns blinked by like eyelids. Jonah slept in the way a man sleeps when he believes a woman will wake him if it is needed, which for some boys is the first true rest in their lives. The ring cooled with the car until it matched her blood. The mirror under June’s knees reflected nothing but shadow and the weird faith of fluorescent bulbs. Between stations, the train refused for a second to believe in rails and then chose to, and the selection might have been a coincidence and was really, in Springfield’s algebra, a wedding.

Morning came on the outskirts of a town that had let itself be called Marrow in a burst of literary optimism and then discovered there would be jokes. The station had a roof that had once been fashioned by men who believed tin could be elevated into priesthood, and that morning it did. The roof caught the pink edge of the day and made it into a small sermon. A woman in a suit with a baby asleep on her shoulder walked past with both the fatigue and the power of women carrying children in public, and Elowen envied her the honesty of that weight. Calder Vane had left a message at the county office saying she would be staging an inspection at noon; Magdalena had replied with a bake sale scheduled at the same time across the square, which is an act of warfare with frosting. June found coffee in a machine that wanted the pretension of art without the inconvenience of a barista, and Jonah found a man to talk to about brake shoes which restored his faith in the parts of the world that can be repaired by hands.

The men they were supposed to meet never came, which is how you know a day has decided to go wrong gently instead of hard. They stood on the platform and waited with that particular hope that is neither foolish nor useful, and El said they were late in a voice that suggested lateness was a hinge and not a sin. Elowen put her hand to the air, found the seam, and offered it the gate of her patience. It did not want blood. It wanted her to say aloud a name she had stopped saying because it tasted like a stone that had beloved someone else’s river. She said her mother’s full name with the middle she had always considered a trap. The air accepted it and gave back not answers but a small mercy: a woman in a yellow coat crossing the street with a paper bag full of unfamiliar fruit, a face Elowen recognized from a photograph that had been framed wrong. The nameless coastal bride had had a sister once. The sister walked like a person who hid objects under her tongue out of habit.

They followed—not like wolves, not like police, but like cousins who have found a family reunion in the wrong town and do not want to frighten the potato salad. The woman in the yellow coat turned into a store that sold seeds and opinions. The bins held beans that looked like the eyes of saints and the packages had names that promised glory with enough water and luck. The woman spoke to the man behind the counter in a dialect made of weather and work. When she saw Elowen, she did not smile. She put her hand to her heart and then back down to the counter to touch a jar full of something pale and bitter. “You are the judge’s granddaughter,” she said, and Elowen accepted the lie because it was a mercy to both of them. “My sister married this town to itself. It never divorced. That is the trouble with certain kinds of vows.”

“She left us a mirror and a ring and a word,” Elowen replied, because economy can be tender. “We came to ask for the cost of keeping them. We came to ask how to return a debt when the debt is older than any collector.”

The woman in the yellow coat measured them with the practiced severity of a woman who had had to sharpen children on her knee into something the world would respect by accident. She told them the story without asking for payment beyond the small and very critical price of attention. The nameless one had come from a coastline where the sea learns to become different animals during the same day and is praised for consistency. She had brought with her a mirror that was originally meant for a different house in which the windows faced an east belonging to people who had decided to be kings in rooms too small for all the crowns they kept. She had married the judge because there are marriages that are forms of forgiveness for a town and who is to say forgiveness is not luck when it survives. She had learned to call the part of herself that refused altars the unking because it was a word that made jokes of sermons and still left the church standing. She had fed the ring breadcrumbs and dog hair and the teeth of a fox that had been killed by a car because the ring had to eat if it was to hold, which is a rule that could be applied to the law as easily as to jewelry. She had remarked once that larger names watched small towns the way hawks watch mouseholes, and she had written the phrase in a ledger under the recipe for jam.

“Where,” June asked, almost reverently, “is the jam.” The woman smiled then, an expression not of softness but of amusement at the sly competence of the living. She handed June the ledger wrapped in brown paper with a string that had previously held a sack of onions shut, and the book was heavier than a recipe needs to be. She let Elowen touch the jar containing the fox teeth and the ring in Elowen’s skin greeted it like a relative met at an airport after a decade of mispronounced names. She told Jonah where the hardware men in town drank and exactly which one would know how to make a culvert teach itself humility. She told them the cost. The cost was public. The cost was embarrassing. The cost was a festival.

“A coronation,” El said, roughly pleased, and Elowen made the noise a woman makes when she knows the dress will fit and she will hate the pictures and the men will clap even if she bleeds through silk. The woman in the yellow coat nodded. “What you think you are,” she said, “and what they think you are, need to be told one another in a place where the wind can hear. It does not have to be pretty. It has to be true in three directions. You will wear a thing that is too heavy for you. You will say you cannot do it. Your aunt will say she can make it lighter. A boy will say he can carry it with you. The trick is to not let the boy take it and to still let him help. After, you will grow larger or smaller, but you will stop being many, and that will save my niece’s baby some trouble when she begins to talk.”

They carried the ledger out into a noon that had misunderstood itself as a kind of evening. The pages inside smelled like sugar and strategy. There were instructions on how to pin ribbon to a day until it behaves, recipes for pies that demanded tears at a critical stage of crust, diagrams for weather hinges that might have been lungs or might have been church pew ends depending on how religious you were feeling. There were three pages devoted to the polite humiliation of larger names. Elowen laughed in a way that made June consider, not for the first time, the sinfulness of desire that waited until women had earned it to arrive.

On the train home, the mirror decided to show its second trick. It reflected not their faces but the courthouse steps with a young woman walking down them who was both Elowen and not, wearing a paper crown the color of old ordinances and the brooch that had been feeding under a tanker made of reflected sky. The bell in the glass rang right in the vision, which made June swear softly because she had not known swearing could ever feel like prayer. El grinned without showing teeth. She did enjoy a pageant if it left blood on a form men were compelled to sign.

Magdalena had already arranged the lemonade stand and the folding chairs by the time they returned. She had called it a festival of vows and pretended to be joking. The pastor down south sent a letter with a dove in the corner and an RSVP marked maybe, which is the kind of chivalry the church likes. Jane from the bakery had rolled out dough in the shape of a crown and gotten flour on her shoulder and had taken a picture of it because she was allowed vanity while practicing love. The switchmen had hung bunting with an indifference that felt honorable. Mae Ruth had sent nails. Benito Otter had asked if he could call the birds to make them sit on the wires like punctuation. The air had begun to practice its listening in a way that made the hairs on forearms do a very helpful trick.

They held the coronation because to refuse is sometimes to set a trap for yourself later with more candles and less leverage. Elowen wore a dress that made her an emblem and it disgusted and improved her posture simultaneously. The crown was made of things that had no business being on heads—switch keys, the broken handle of a gavel, the copper edge from Honeysuckle’s gazebo where blood had made a small covenant, a nail from Mae Ruth’s drawer with a bend in it where it had learned regret. Jonah stood at her shoulder with his palms open because he could not think what else to do that would not be mistaken for ownership. June held the ledger and read aloud the parts that had to be spoken so that later no one could say women had kept secrets in closets and sprung them on the town like surprises with cost. Magdalena knelt not as a woman broken by command but as a woman who had decided to put her head low and make the town bow to that posture instead.

The vows were unfashionable. They promised boredom as a blessing. They promised to feed the wind when it came to eat their corn in exchange for being allowed to bring their children up without running into the road at every siren. They promised to be interested in small hells and to leave the big ones to the men with microphones. They promised to talk before they called from the bridge. They promised to remember the missing in ways that did not involve punishing the present. A boy cried because he had a splinter and the sound folded itself into the liturgy. El observed it all with the alert disdain of a cat that has chosen to sit in a lap after announcing she would never put herself so low. When the crown went on Elowen’s head, it bit in three places that would scar small and permanent, which is exactly how a government ought to be carried.

After, when the lemonade had been poured and someone had brought a guitar that made all the songs taste like the nineteen-eighties, when the pastor’s people had taken photographs and gone home to say that the town’s sins were as photogenic as anyone else’s and that television would eat this whole thing with a fork, when the bell had rung right once for spite and wrong twice for charm, Elowen went to the mirror room with her aunt. They stood in front of the glass without ceremony because ceremony is not the way to ask your own other self to tell you a secret. El did not come at first. When she did, it was with the look of someone who has been forced to sit through speeches and is both furious and endeared.

You made a hinge out of a party, she said, and the words loosened something behind Elowen’s sternum she had not admitted was tight. I have seen worse governance, El continued, not unkind. Your large names will have less fun here for a while. They will have to choose a different road to drive through on a Sunday. There are bigger storms. There are men who carry them like hobbies. Do not forget to drink water. Do not forget to break bread with the people who cannot afford your metaphors. Do not forget to be boring on purpose because boredom is a gate. The ring warmed with agreement like a small animal with its head in a sun-patch.

Elowen put her hand to the glass and did not ask anything in particular. The mirror was generous, for once. It showed her mother on the courthouse roof in a skirt that had meant more to her enemies than to her, feeding biscuit to the ring with an absent tenderness that made Elowen want to invent the word grandmother for a woman who had died too early to deserve it. It showed the nameless bride writing the word unking with a sly smile in a ledger so honey-stained it might have been Scripture if you squinted and did not fear apostasy. It showed June asleep in a chair with a book on her chest like a cat that guards its owner against dreams, and Jonah repairing a doorknob with a concentration that looked like prayer, and Magdalena alone in a room with a phone against her ear and a hand on her own throat to keep something inside from climbing out and frightening donors. It showed El herself standing in a field outside of language, holding out a hand to an old weather that did not recognize her and would have to be persuaded with good bread and shame.

When the glass went flat again, the air in the room moved like someone who had been preparing to confess and had decided to wait because the timing could make a good story into a dangerous one. The bell above them clicked as if clearing its throat to laugh and then remembered it had become the town’s shared bad timing and chose to be noble. The river, sulking and obedient, flowed the correct way with the kind of stubborn hope that makes farms. Outside, men took down bunting and offered each other beers with hands that shook a little from the effort of being decent in public. Jane from the bakery leaned against the statue of the judge and ate a slice of cake with her fingers because forks had gone home in purses and she had decided to live anyway. Elowen let herself sit on the steps and ruin her dress and thought for one aching, beautiful moment that she had become smaller and larger in the same day and that maybe, if God had any opinions left that he had not sold cheap to pastors, that was the point of the job.

Night fell with the old bluntness it reserves for small places that have used their energy well. The carnival lights in the square went out in a slow consent. There would be no sirens until morning, which is a kind of miracle the Department of Continuity cannot hold a press conference about. June walked home with the ledger under her arm and the mirror at her back held by a strap that left two pink lines on her shoulders. Jonah went to his mother and let her check his pockets for candy wrappers and lies. Magdalena finished three letters and began a fourth addressed to a woman she had never met who would sell her eight new ambulances if she used the word community enough times and wrote the check before lunch. Elowen went to bed and did not dream, which was its own hinge and its own gift and maybe, if anyone had been there to witness, would have been proof.The day after the vows the town wore its quiet the way a child wears a grown man’s coat, sleeves dragging, hem catching on everything, proud and ill at ease at the same time. Elowen woke to the smell of flour and tires and the particular sweetness of paper that has been folded around sausage biscuits by hands that do not fear grease. She walked barefoot to Jane’s bakery because she wanted to begin the day with a woman whose forearms had always told the truth. Jane had her hair pinned back with carpenter’s pencils and a dusting of sugar on her cheek that made her look like a sinner in a painting who has been forgiven without understanding how. She looked at the crown-bite marks along Elowen’s hairline, inhaled softly through her teeth as if the pain belonged to pastry, and reached under the counter for a jar of something yellow that smelled like clean knives and summer. “You did a thing my grandmother would not have forgiven you for doing in her living room,” she observed, tilting Elowen’s head to smear salve across the tender divots. “But she would have fed you afterward because she believed bread was the thing that kept all our wrong ideas from falling into holes.” The salve burned first and then behaved like a second skin you had applied on purpose, and Elowen felt the odd gratitude one reserves for instruments that are both necessary and ugly.

Calder Vane returned before noon with a car that believed in itself the way men believe in their own prayers, and she had a new companion with her, a woman whose cheeks had the pale, energetic look of a person who eats deadlines for breakfast. She introduced the companion as Dr. Etain Lecler, historian of public artifacts and household altars, which meant she had spent a career convincing men in rooms with carpet that ladles and rings had never been mere decorations at women’s work. The square had been hung with bunting that had already learned how to be weary, and Magdalena stood at the foot of the steps with a tray of lemonade and a stack of forms in a clip so old it remembered being steel. Dr. Lecler took the lemonade as if accepting a sacrament in the wrong church and peered past Magdalena toward the library with eyes that had cataloged conquest and wedding photograph in the same sentence. “We are not taking,” Dr. Lecler said pleasantly enough, which told Elowen the woman could smell offense at a hundred yards, “we are assessing stewardship. Continuity belongs to everyone, especially when a town has named the wind.” Calder moved her hand minutely in a way that suggested she believed in both partnerships and leashes.

They set their instruments out with the prim efficiency of people who carry whole cities in their trunks. There were tripods with mouthlike discs that faced the bell and then turned shyly toward the fountain; there were thin threads of wire strung from bench to bench, delicate as spiderline and twice as presumptuous; there was a wooden case with small drawers that clicked open to reveal slips engraved with phrases like vector consent and acoustic mooring as if paper had learned to preen in jargon. Jonas from the water department leaned against a light pole and watched with the kind of face men use when they intend to gossip to their wives in a way that makes both love and scorn sound like hope. June stood on the library steps with the ledger in a cloth bag and the mirror leaned behind the puppet stage, where the dragon with the offensively cheerful eyes stared at bureaucrats like they were a pretend fire he had not yet been permitted to breathe on. El drifted in the reflection of the fountain’s skin and said, without bothering to articulate, that this would be a hinge disguised as a meeting.

Magdalena conducted the opening remarks with the grace of a woman who once cut her own dress to fit a charity’s budget on the courthouse floor. She welcomed the Department’s curiosity and refused its anxiety without wrinkling anything important. Calder explained the purpose of the Breath Array with a sincerity that might have been real if you squinted: to study the town’s new habits of air so that other towns could learn by example and federal policy could keep up with faith. The phrase study the town’s new habits landed like a spoon thrown across a church kitchen, and Jane from the bakery coughed into a dishtowel because she was not a woman content to let a word like study pass without knowing who had sharpened it. Etain Lecler asked politely to see the mirror and June said, equally politely, that the children were asleep in that part of the building, which made the historian’s mouth thin the way mouths thin when they are trying not to enjoy a fight too much. Elowen stood to the side and practiced swallowing. She had learned that not every yes should be said with the throat; some had to be said with wrists and posture and the willingness to be looked at while saying no.

The Breath Array hummed to life with a sound like a million files being opened in the same office, and the square did that thing the square does when new rules are being tested: it listened with its shoulders. A pale fringe fluttered along the wires, barometer ribbons tied to cheap clips, and the discs turned toward the courthouse as if they had agreed ahead of time to adore. Etain’s assistant, a girl with a baby tattooed in faint blue at the bend of her arm, called out numbers that sounded like hymn verses in a strange parish. Calder stood with her hands behind her back like a soldier being good in front of company. The feeling in the air was not an invasion so much as a suggestion with money attached. El’s attention narrowed in Elowen’s body until she felt it like a cat settling heavier on a lap. “They are trying to fix the hinge,” El said with a interest that would have been admiration if her pride were less athletic. “They will not make a new door. They will pin the old one open and call it kindness.”

June carried the ledger down the steps as if she were taking communion to the sick, and her face had gone into the particular rapture of a woman who has read something silently twenty times and is ready to say it aloud because people keep trying to pretend paper cannot be louder than microphones. She opened to a page that had a jam stain making a map of the county across legal language and lifted her chin as if to offer her throat as witness but not dinner. “We would like to host a public item under the open-meeting laws,” she said to Calder with a blandness that would have read as ignorance if Calder were less well paid. “A roll call of names. You are welcome to collect your vectors while we do it. We have discovered the air behaves best when it knows it is being watched.” Etain Lecler looked at Magdalena like a student looks at a teacher she has not yet decided to respect, and the Regent spread her hands a quarter-inch and intimated that in Springfield, rituals with boredom baked into them are how blood learns to stop making so many decisions by itself.

They began with the dead not because the dead deserve precedence but because their names come easiest to mouths that want to prove they have a right to gather. Magdalena spoke her mother’s and did not bow her head because the woman had never approved of signatures on things people could not cash. Jane from the bakery said a list that included boys with bad knees, girls with too much eyeliner, and an aunt who had taught her that grease is a kind of sacrament if you use it under the right light. The switchmen said the names they wrote under train car graffiti in a neat hand with a stub pencil when they were thirty and angry about lungs. June said the name of the librarian who had taught her to put away women first when she had a stack of returns because women’s labor deserved swift resurrection. Elowen spoke names that tasted like the river and then names that tasted like someone had used a church as a kitchen, and the wires vibrated minutely as the voices braided themselves into a rope that was both witness and threat. Calder nodded to Etain in a way that suggested the Department had not expected to be bored and was learning how to weaponize patience.

Etain held up a finger delicately and called for a pause as a reading on her little screen blinked and then refused to make sense for the third time. The discs trembled, and the ribbons along the wire went from girlish flutter to soldierly lift. A low pressure lay across the square like a hand on a baby’s back that was not sure whether to comfort or claim. Elowen felt El’s attention widen in a way that lifted sweat along her spine. “They have a second machine,” El told her with affection shading into scorn. “They call it an anchor. It is the polite cousin of a shackle. They will say it keeps people from falling in love with their own storms.” In the back of the van that had pretended not to have van-ness for the last half hour, a field team member unrolled a matte gray sheet that looked like nothing more than a drop cloth and flapped it twice before dropping it across the courthouse steps. The moment the cloth touched stone, Elowen heard the bell bite its own permission and go rigid.

Magdalena smiled, a small, flashing thing a deer might use when it wanted to make wolves doubt their religion, and clapped her hands to get the roll call moving again. She did not look at the gray cloth, which is the kind of refusal that keeps small towns from being chewed up by bigger names, and she kept her voice steady in the place where women make tithes and taxes behave. June whispered gate into the crook of her arm like a love affair with paper and Elowen understood how a woman with wire cutters could be as dangerous as any preacher. Jonah, who had been standing quietly in the shade and practicing not being a boy with a lost father, moved toward the van at a walk that looked almost bored. He had a wrench in his back pocket with a bit of ribbon attached to it because his mother believed in marking her tools the way old women mark their hymns. He leaned into conversation with the assistant in the doorway the way men lean when they want to be mistaken for incompetent in order to be useful, and the assistant made the fatal error of liking him.

“What is that,” Jonah asked, tipping his head at the drop cloth with a curiosity that sounded neighborly. “We use tarps like that to keep the county salt from clumping. Ours don’t hum.” The assistant, who had practiced saying language like no one should ever have to apologize for being right, explained continuity mats and signal discipline and the protocols for emergency breath stabilization with the enthusiasm of someone who had learned to be proud of a job people did not know existed. Jonah grunted appreciatively and gestured at the mat with his bandaged hand. “We had a boy stuck in a culvert last night,” he offered. “You ever try putting one of those over a hole and inviting a thing to be polite?” The assistant admitted with a laugh that holes did not respect laminated guidelines, and while the assistant smiled, Jonah reached behind him and popped a single cable loose from the mat’s transformer with his wrench in a motion so clean it looked like a gesture of prayer.

The Breath Array hiccuped and tried to pretend it had always meant to. Etain looked up sharply and lifted her meter to her ear as if sound had begun to prefer an older instrument. Calder made the small mouth that means someone has remembered the existence of live television and donors with moods. Elowen put her palm to the bannister in front of the mats and found that the hinge had moved from the bell to the square’s listening. It did not want blood this time. It wanted the ridiculous, expensive, unglamorous gift called face. “I will go first,” she said to Magdalena in a voice meant only for women who have held gates with their shoulders so long they think wood is a cousin. “And then you, and then June. Then we will ask the man with the worst shirt and the little girl with the missing tooth.” Magdalena’s eyes flicked once, and then the Regent widened her mouth into a smile that made three men with acronyms put their coffee cups down.

Elowen climbed onto the edge of the cloth with the care a woman uses when she is about to step onto thin ice and intends to pretend she trusts the law anyway. The mat hummed under her feet as if scandalized to be asked to carry a person instead of data; she placed one foot and then the other and did not accept the hand Etain reflexively offered, not because she did not want to touch the woman but because she needed the town to see she could balance in public. She did not speak at first. She let the mat take her weight and count it and be bored by it. Then she spoke the least flattering fact about herself that was both true and safe to offer while holding government metal: that she loved to be useful more than she loved to be good, and that sometimes her town had fed her that love because it needed work done and had not minded the cost. There was a snort from a teenager against a lamppost because teenagers are the world’s best theologians when it comes to hypocrisy. El’s presence at Elowen’s shoulder warmed with the kind of pride you reserve for a person who has finally learned to stop flattering herself in front of mirrors.

Magdalena took her place next, stepping up with that small authority that keeps shoes from squeaking. She confessed nothing because this was not a courtroom and she has always despised performance when it is not getting work done, but she told the square three truths in a row that did the job of a confession without the spectacle: that she had taken money from men she did not trust in order to buy medicine for children, that she had called another woman weak to her face because kindness would have cost them a fire truck, and that she had once locked herself in a bathroom and counted the chips in the tile to keep from making a phone call that would have made her sister proud. June did not mount the mat at all. She sat down on its edge with the unarguable authority of a librarian taking her break and said, into air that had felt itself big since morning, that she had stolen a book and then returned it and had no intention of being better than that in the future. It was an ugly little liturgy and it took less than a minute and when they finished, the Breath Array lowered its shoulders like a man forced to admit a woman he loved had won a petty argument by being unusually exact.

They asked children and drunks and Jane from the bakery to speak next, and the mat, which had been designed to catch wind and assign it to boxes, struggled to index human unglamour. It is a very old rule of this world that shame loosens certain hinges no ritual can touch. The bell above them did not ring. It was listening. Calder Vane widened her smile without moving her eyes and asked if the town would agree to a second phase of observation under the terms of Title III of the Public Safety and Mythic Stewardship Accord, which may or may not have existed five minutes before she said it out loud. Magdalena set a cupcake with violently pink frosting on the hood of Calder’s car, which is local dialect for we will answer later and likely with a knife wrapped in a napkin.

The Array’s readings steadied, which is to say they became less interesting to the people who had brought them. Etain Lecler folded her little meter like a fan and shook Elowen’s hand with real heat, which almost forgave her everything. “You did not let them hang the air,” she murmured, and Elowen believed for a second that the historian had been on the side of women the entire time and had simply been paid too well to show it. The mat’s cable, secretly freed, lay coiled in the van like a snake that had become exhausted by its own responsibilities. Jonah found a bolt on the bench and put it in his pocket because he had always believed in collecting pieces of the machines that failed in front of his face. June tucked the ledger under her cardigan and nearly fell over because the weight of other people’s jokes about jam can surprise you if you’re not careful. El said nothing, which is how one woman says I am pleased with another woman when the world is still watching.

They thought the price had been paid for the day until Mae Ruth Lively’s nail box arrived on the steps without Mae Ruth attached to it. A thin nurse with steady hands and a swallow of a voice came up to Magdalena and said in the small plain sentences of women who sew and close eyes that Mae Ruth had decided to float. She had done it like a woman leaving the room in the middle of a story she had been telling for seventy years: with a sigh and a small flap of the hand that meant you all know the rest, be kind to my worst jokes. The box felt heavier than wood should ever admit to being, and inside the nails lay with more dignity than stereotypes allow. June held the box as if it were a child that had misbehaved at a wedding and asked permission to let it continue. The note on top, in Mae Ruth’s hand that had learned letters while holding a pie tin, said nothing that could be quoted in public. It said simply, for when the house forgets it is attached to the yard.

The brooch returned as if to prove that jokes the living make do travel. A boy from out near the silos turned up at Jane’s back door after dinner, holding a handful of grass and a piece of metal that had been changed by a summer in the stomach of something larger and less impressed than people. He had a look like those old saints painted in houses with tin roofs—blunt, baffled, delighted by his own nerve. “It cut its way out,” he said, which is a sentence that ought to earn a man forgiveness for any number of future errors, and Jane took the brooch with a reverence she had trained her hands for and set it gently on a clean cloth like an infant who did not ask to be born. The copper had eaten a memory of green off something else and kept it; the curve that made a river on its face had become a place where light sat and considered the idea of covenants. It clicked against Elowen’s skin with the sound of a door that has been painted shut for years and then finally opened by a woman with dirty knuckles and good breath.

Magdalena would not take the Department’s phone calls that night, not because she was afraid but because she had learned from hard teachers that dignity is often a matter of timing and turned-off ringers. She wrote three letters instead and one of them was to a woman in Calder’s office whose first name she did not use because she did not want to give that intimacy away for free. The letter said, in the polite music of a woman from an unfashionable county who has been purpose-built to make more visible counties envy her: we are managing our hinge with a consortium you do not own, bless you for your concern, bring a pie and your boots if you intend to help. June sat at her own kitchen table with the ledger open and a pen she had stolen from the breath team’s van and transcribed recipes in a hand so precise it could have been hired to write sins, and every time she translated a quantity into neighbor she felt better about keeping something heavy on an upper shelf.

Elowen slept between storms like a person who has finally given her throat to the right thing and can rest because the laws of pity are temporarily on her side. El sat at the foot of her bed, a habit that would have terrified a less tired woman, and did not try to enter, which is how you know you have found a boundary that both women feel they had a hand in drawing. She woke to a town that had dressed itself for a visit and hadn’t told anyone, a square where men had shaved deliberately and the courthouse had remembered it was once a house when you were small and your mother left you to sleep under the council table because she had something to argue past midnight. The radio hinted at the Department’s pique and promised a symposium on weather governance in a regional center with carpeting next month. The pastor down south sent another letter with more doves and fewer adjectives and Elowen set it under the leg of a chair that had been wobbling, which rendered the letter immediately useful in the only way she believes certain men can be.

By afternoon, the wind had acquired that adolescent quality towns know too well—the willingness to be cruel to prove it exists. It took a woman’s hat off not because it hated her but because it wanted to see if anyone would chase, and two children laughed and ran after it and almost into a truck because adults are poor barriers in public spaces but will tear their hearts out of their chests to pretend otherwise. The bigger names made themselves known not as agents or prayers or wolves but as a billboard on the highway outside the feed store that had belonged to a seed company and now announced Continuity: It’s Working. The words did not want argument. They wanted premiere. Jonah rode his bicycle past the billboard and threw a look at it so bored that the wood had the decency to blush. He had a list in his pocket of things to buy for his mother: screws, aspirin, a cheap scrub brush that would ruin itself in two sinkloads, and he bought them with a dignity that made the cashier remember her own son when he was nineteen and had lit a field on fire by accident and then cried because he had thought that was bravery.

There was no siren at dusk. The river did not reverse itself. The bell, cracked and principled, rang wrong twice in the same five minutes and then waited as if to see if the town would forgive it for not wanting to be perfect. Edda May sat on the courthouse steps with a popsicle the color of hazard tape and told a boy that she had thought the Boone County line was an actual line once, painted on the road, and that she had cried when it turned out to be only a sign because children prefer their boundaries to be honest. Mae Ruth’s box of nails sat on Magdalena’s desk like a cat who has arrived for the purpose of holding down the paper. Calder Vane’s car left town at nine in a flurry of tempered glass and promises to return, and Etain Lecler, who had acquired a scrap of Jane’s apron to wrap around her wrist for luck, sent a postcard from a motel two towns over with a picture of a deer that did not live anywhere near there and wrote, in a hand that had learned to be legible under duress, you are taking good care of your hinge, please do not let men with grants name it.

That night, El came not in the glass but in the window, as if she were a reflection of something beyond both women that had finally decided to admit it could be seen. She had a look that would have been jealousy if Elowen were a man. Instead it was recognition sharpened into a blade purely to test the edges. “They will stop being polite,” she said aloud because the hour allowed speech, and Elowen startled because however many times you talk to yourself inside your skull, there are nights when hearing a mouth in your room still feels like something you should throw a shoe at. “They will decide continuity requires fewer names and more numbers. They will ask your aunt to pick between money and the mirror, which is the same choice men keep giving women when they think women have not rehearsed for their tricks.” El stood close enough to be questioned and far enough that you could pretend you were not the one who had invited frenzy into a courthouse.

Elowen did not say yes or no, because she had learned over the last three days that answering can be a kind of consent. She took the brooch out of her pocket where it had been practicing being a hunger and set it on the windowsill the way a woman sets out a bowl of water for a cat she is trying not to adopt and has already bought a collar for. The brooch made a neat shadow on the sill and the shadow looked like a river when there is a storm at the horizon and the corn is deciding whether to kneel. “What is the story you keep not telling me,” Elowen asked, because she had promised herself one question per night in which she requested a thing that might make her ugly. “The one where you decide not to be me and I decide not to be you and we both still have to live in a town that has made an altar of our accident.”

El considered being sentimental and decided against it, which is the kindest thing she has ever learned to do. “The story is this,” she said. “We will save a boy who does not deserve it because he is a boy and the law in this county is older than anyone’s idea of dessert. We will lose a woman who does not deserve it because she is a woman and the law is older than anyone’s idea of dessert. We will try not to make speeches about how equal it all is because it won’t be, not today. We will make you boring enough to vote and dangerous enough to be loved, and that balance will kill your appetite for both pie and war. You will promise not to throw me into the river after we have finished using each other’s hands. I will promise not to keep the weather like a pet while you are asleep.” She reached for the brooch with a look a person uses when they are in the mood to steal and then set her own hand on her own heart like an apology nobody had earned.

In the morning the missing poster in the alley had been replaced by a photograph of a woman no one wanted to call missing, which is the kind of cruelty friends are paid to forgive. She had a half-smile like someone who had agreed to be beautiful as a favor and was now bored. Her name was Susanna Reach, and she ran the hardware store out on the county road and kept a jar of candy on the counter like grandmothers do on purpose and men do by accident. Her absence tasted like debt and old wrenches. Men with belts on their pants in the middle of the day looked away in a way that told the truth about the sex of fear. Jonah went there at lunch with his mother’s tin and came back with nothing but the echo of his own feet and a sour humor that is the only inheritance some boys get; June put her fingers on the counter like a woman checking the pulse of an animal that has just bitten her, and found the subtle dent where someone had put a nail down so hard the wood had learned the shape on principle. Elowen stood in the doorway and felt the hinge that was not a hinge at all; it was the kind of seam that forms in the world when someone puts their hand on your throat and tells you it is for your own good.

Calder Vane called at noon to request, with velvet wrapped around a threat, a demonstration of the mirror to a closed committee composed of five people with ten names. Magdalena said they would be delighted to host such a thing in an open gazebo in Honeysuckle with lemonade and mosquitoes as equal participants and that the Department could reserve the horses on the carousel for a fee payable in cash. Calder did not laugh because her job is the kind that punishes women who spend their tenderness on the phone. She said a thing about writs and men, and Magdalena said a thing about writs and women, and the conversation hung up on itself. Jonah tied his boots and went to the river because he needed to break something you cannot arrest a person for breaking, and June took a long breath and decided this was the afternoon she would finally steal an entire filing cabinet from the Department of Transportation.

They met that night under the bell because it had become the only place where lies drained themselves into the wood. Men who had never cried in public stood too close to one another and let the corners of their mouths be soft like bread. Women who had been promised dignity by insufficient men decided to keep it for themselves. Elowen looked at the faces arranged around her and saw that sometimes the miracle is not wind or choosing or bells that ring wrong; sometimes the miracle is neighbors who agree to be bored together in order to spare a child an interesting death. “We will go to the hardware store in the morning,” she said in a voice that has learned, reluctantly, to be obeyed. “We will bring a pie and Mae Ruth’s nails and the brooch in a cloth like a baby and the ledger like a knife. We will ask the shelves to witness. We will ask the cash register if it wants to be an altar. We will not let Calder take the mirror because she has better things to do with her time and worse things to sell later. We will lift the hinge where the back door meets the breath of the loading dock and we will call Susanna’s name into it until our throats think we are foolish. If this fails, we will use uglier tools.”

After the meeting, when everyone had gone to their separate beds and decided whether they preferred sleep to a bad late-night television show made of worry, June and Elowen sat on the courthouse floor with the ledger open and the brooch between them like an animal they were trying to domesticate with consistent affection and inappropriate jokes. Magdalena put her hand on the bell rope and her other hand on her own ribs and sang, softly, a song their mother had used to hum when the taxes were cruel and the county fair had not given the family a ribbon. The air obliged by refusing to fall asleep quickly. El sat in the mirror without bothering to appear because sometimes an absence shared is the most companionable thing in the world. The river did not hear its name and turn for them. The wind did not offer its throat. The town went on being a place where you can get bread cheap if you sleep with your hair braided and your debts written on the backs of envelopes, which is to say the nation was safe for one more night in a way no statute can measure.

Morning smelled like sawdust and clean lies. The hardware store’s door stuck in the exact way doors stick when the weather has been having opinions about politics. June touched the bell taped under the counter for emergencies and felt a shame that did not belong to her, which is something women have learned to catalog and shelve under Other People’s Problems while still refusing to let it dismember people they love. The back room had a coil of rope that belonged in a family longer than religion and three metal trash cans that had learned to store secrets long after anyone had used them for actual garbage. The ledger opened itself to a page without being asked, which is a trick books perform when certain kinds of women have asked the world for too much and too little in the same hour. Gate, the script said in a hand that had thought about jam and the law at the same time, is where money learns the shape of a breath.

El told Elowen to stand where Susanna would have stood at close of business—hand on the scanner, mind on the grocery list, spine carrying more of the county’s shame than women are paid to shoulder in places where men pretend the bills arrive from God. Elowen placed the brooch on the counter edge under the little sign that offered dog treats for free and candy for a nickel, and the brooch settled there like a small compromised crown. June slid a nail between the drawer and the register in the exact way her grandfather had done when he’d taught her the trick of coaxing rather than breaking, and she whispered witness in the scanner’s cracked glass, which had learned to read certain plastics as value and had long suspected that value was a trick. They said Susanna Reach together, not because calling names has magic but because not calling them makes monsters. The hinge in the room moved.

It took them a long time to hear it. That is another unglamorous truth about decent works: the payoff is often late and bitter and hidden like a debt on the books of a city too proud to admit its lights are rented. The hinge was in the place where the hand drawn map on the wall showed the aisles; someone had marked an X where winter salt will be in January with a heart because maybe they had been in love or not and this was simply how they managed inventory. Elowen walked to the little X and put her head against the pegboard, and it felt like leaning into someone’s chest when that person has promised under their breath to always tell you if the house is on fire. She said gift in the small version of her voice and bled without dramatic sound on the heart mark, which felt like punishment and was really accountancy. June said witness again, louder, and said the name of a boy who had been banned from the store for stealing screws in his pocket to build a go-kart that had taught him to love and survive embarrassment. The register drawer sprang open in a miniature act of resistance and spat three pennies that had been old enough to have been coins in a different government.

Susanna Reach crawled out from the space under the stairs with the precise fury of a woman who had decided to shame a man and had been interrupted by a bigger sin. She was dusty and more alive than anyone had given her permission to be all week. She held a roll of tape in her teeth and her hands were full of a device that had been both a tracker and an insult. She pulled it off herself with a noise a woman usually makes during labor and flung it onto the counter with a contempt that repaired both of their dignity. “That woman tried to buy me with compliance,” she said, and no one asked which woman because it is very easy to be wrong on purpose in a county this size. “She said I could help keep your town from embarrassing itself if I would just let her tag me like a deer. I told her a deer would have better manners about it.” She looked at Elowen like a person considering a game she has taught five other children and loves and despises simultaneously, and then she took the brooch up from the counter and pinned it to Elowen’s dress with a firmness that would leave a bruise in a shape you could tell a future by.

They did not arrest anyone because the law comes slow to places where girls are allowed to be wolves and the wolves have learned to wear pearls. Calder Vane telephoned and said a series of words that had already been written into a template and saved as an email in seventeen offices, and Magdalena let her talk until a mouse could have built a cathedral in the silence, and then said, we are resolved, which is local for please tell your bosses to write a new letter. Etain Lecler sent a short message without doves and said, steal what you have to and leave catalogs in their place, which is a sentence no public servant should ever put into writing and is the best advice anyone ever gave a librarian. The Breath Array was packed into a van that seemed embarrassed to be seen in daylight, and the gray mat folded up the way a snake folds when it has eaten something it shouldn’t and intends to sleep it off beside a men’s room tile.

That evening June and Jane and Susanna and Elowen sat at the bakery table after close and salted their lemonade because sometimes women prefer their drinks to be complicated on purpose. Jane took off her apron and shook flour into the air like a blessing and the particles hung there long enough to make the room a chapel. Susanna told the story of how you recognize an anchor when it shows up in the back of your store in the hands of a woman who says the word continuity like it is both a crucifix and a condom. June read aloud from the ledger that had jam and law written in it about how festivals keep the hungry from inventing gods that do not need bread. Elowen touched the brooch and felt it purr, which meant it had taken something from the river and something from a cow and something from a boy and had not yet decided which thing it intended to be loyal to. El reclined in the window and smirked and for once did not enjoy being the most dangerous woman in the room.

The bell rang wrong at nine and then not at all, and in the new silence Calder Vane’s billboard out by the feed store peeled at one corner like a confession deciding whether to leave the mouth. The ring on Elowen’s finger cooled and warmed in turns as if remembering it had been fed biscuit and then blood and then the tiredness of a day where no one had the time to be very good and had settled for being better than yesterday. Bigger names sent emails to one another with subject lines that said Action Needed and microscopes sat unused on two different stainless steel tables. The river put its elbows on the bank and watched the square as if it had been hired to judge dancing. A boy named Benito practiced whistles below his breath on his walk home and got one of the bird songs right and grinned as if he had stolen a hinge and intended to make it into a toy.

Night had a spine. The stars pretended not to know about counties and succeeded. In the room with the mirror, Magdalena and Elowen stood together without saying the kinds of things people say when they have just avoided being humiliated by better-funded strangers. El kept her distance like a woman proud of her sister on a day when fidelity to oneself has proven to be a heavy plate to balance in public. “Practice,” she said, which has become their goodnight, and Elowen smiled in a way that had no charm because charm is not always a virtue and in this town has never been a policy. She set the brooch in a dish with her keys because domestication is a weapon women have taught to perform miracles, and then she laid the ringed hand over the ledger and slept without dreaming until morning because sometimes the gift you ask of the air is simply to be let alone.
