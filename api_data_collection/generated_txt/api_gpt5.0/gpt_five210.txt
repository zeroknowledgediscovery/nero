At dawn the parliament trees glittered with ribbons and salt-silvered gulls, and the clerks made coffee the color of bark. A light wind moved through the glass eaves, lifting the paper clouds strung up for Rain Tax Day. Somewhere above, the Ministers of Snack and Sound argued gently in whistles and hoots about the ratio of figs to trombones in this year’s Harvest Parade, and somewhere below, a secretary with crooked bangs straightened a stack of minutes that nobody would read, knowing full well that sometimes minutes were bombs.

Her name was Inez Vale. They called her “notes,” “sprinter,” “hey you,” depending on whether they were being polite or just distracted. A human in a city of monkey law, she kept to the edges and kept the doors oiled. She had the gift of forgetting faces until it mattered, and then remembering everything. Her typewriter was named Kettle because it hissed when you leaned too hard. Its ribbon ink got under her fingernails like honest work, and, if you looked closely, you could see a tiny fingerprint map smudged near the M and the S. She liked the smell of oiled rope and lemon peel, the way the bridges swung between ministry buildings like the city was breathing. She liked the mornings best, before the drums started.

The drums were for ratification, for the bang-bang stamp of Monkey Rule. Twenty-seven ministers representing twenty-seven orders, gathered to smack an object across the polished floor, and where the object rolled to, that was law. Not a gavel. Not a seal. A ball; specifically, the Football. Battered leather, dark as a storm nest, riveted with brass stars that glinted in the lantern light. They kept it in a glass terrarium on a stand carved from petrified branchwood. Inez typed it as an uppercase noun: the Football. Also known as the Founding Orb, the Dayball, the Scuffle. The first generation of governors, the Orangatari and the Bright-Faced Baboons, had played a game in the square with it, so the story goes, barefoot and barely convincing, until the gulls fell silent and the crowd agreed that winners should rule. The rules were written on a vellum scroll, tucked into a seam under the laces. Nobody had unstitched it in fifty years. That was the charm.

On the morning that starts this, there was a fingerprint on the inside of the terrarium and no ball. The finger left a crescent in the condensation like a moon receding from a planet. The terrarium’s latch hung open, tongue out. There were petals on the floor. There were three peanuts crushed under a pawprint. Inez noticed first because she was the one who dusted and tried to do it in the same pattern so that the monkeys would feel all was well. Now her careful dust arcs were broken. Now a circle of guards gathered, tails lashing.

Brigadier Plume arrived out of a pinkish fog of dignitaries. He was mandrill, heavy-jawed, geometric cheeks painted with blues and reds as sharp as a flag’s scream. The brass of his shoulder plates had been polished with banana oil. He carried a switch in one hand and a folded newspaper in the other, and he tapped both against his thigh like twin metronomes. “Well?” he said, to the room, to the glass, to Inez. Inez snapped her mouth shut because she had been about to say “It’s gone.” He knew that; everyone knew that, it was the absence, the way a missing tooth is more noticeable once you disturb it.

“Soot!” the Brigadier barked.

A rhesus with a scabbed ear sprang forward. Soot was a runner, quick as whipped air, with an expression like a half-remembered joke. He met Inez’s eyes for one half glance and, in that half glance, told her something: don’t.

The Prime Arbiter of Branch and Benevolence arrived next, a silver langur with the kind of contemplative stillness that slowed rooms. He took in the terrarium. His fingers flexed once. A whispering started in the rafters where the junior macaques did their gossip and their math. Inez kept her gaze on the glass because when frightened she found details: the small chip by the hinge from where someone had tried to open it six months ago; the printed label she’d hand-lettered last spring curling at one corner; the tiny long hair, human, stuck in the seam. Hers? Someone’s. She dropped her eyes before the Brigadier dropped his.

“Everyone in the hall,” Brigadier Plume said. “Nobody leaves. Nobody. Guards on the roof, guards underground, guards in the tea. I want sniffs. I want prints. I want this. I want my sleep back.”

“I beg the Brigadier,” said the Prime Arbiter very softly, his voice like a bell rung in a jar, “to remember that the last time we panicked, the geese died.”

“We will not panic,” Plume said. “We will focus.” He cracked the newspaper, shook it out, as if the news might flutter up the answer. The headline was about the Rain Tax. The picture was of a girl in a waterproof hat, laughing, teeth on display, and for one aching second Inez could not find her brother’s face in her memory. She had been trying not to see his face since they built the rope fence by Human Quarter Gate. He liked to juggle loquats. He liked to tidy his hair with twine. He was probably fine.

Probably.

The Spymaster slung in, coiling his tail around the upright. Needle was a capuchin in a jacket too big for his shoulders, embroidered with unflattering victory scenes. His head tilted the way a hawk’s head tilts. “Doors are doors,” he announced. “Windows are windows. People are messy. We will find a thread.” He sniffed the terrarium latch, then sneezed. “Pepper.”

Inez could feel her heartbeat in the paper she held. “There was a rehearsal last night,” she heard herself say. “For the All-City Petitions. The terrarium keys—” She stopped herself. Because here’s the part that had been true for months: she had them. She had them because the Prime Arbiter did not like to carry keys; keys made him feel like a landlord, he said, and not a philosopher. Only when the Ministers wanted to touch the Dayball, to rub it for luck before their speeches, would they send for Inez and say, “notes?” and she would bring the keys in a velvet bag with the stitched phrase that she had embroidered when she still believed that embroidery could be sly. The phrase said: SALVATION IS PUNCTUALITY. She had been drunk on tins of cider the night she made it.

“You have the record,” Needle said to her. It sounded like a question but wasn’t.

She swallowed. “The bag is in my desk. The latch is intact. I—I locked the terrarium at the close of adjacency, twenty-one twenty. I left at twenty-two forty-five. Night guard called eleven, then eleven thirty. I took two sheets of paper that weren’t mine. I returned them this morning. I put a fig skin under the Minister of Sound’s chair.”

“Why.”

“So he would think he was haunted.”

“By?”

Inez closed her eyes briefly. “His own appetites.”

There was the little gesture again, the tightening around the corners of the Prime Arbiter’s mouth when humans said something nice. He did that when he was sad and appreciative and resigned, which was most of the time when dealing with her. It was not some dangerous intimacy and it was not nothing. It was merely the tilt a mountain makes when you find a different side. That was what had kept her here instead of running (where? to the salt fields? to the ferries and their rivets?) for three hours every five days for three years now.

“We must swallow the day,” the Prime Arbiter said. “We may not ratify harvest if we can’t drum. We may not drum if our founding object is in someone else’s mouth.”

“Postpone,” said Brigadier Plume. “We’ll announce nothing. There’ll be no drums today. Needle, spread powder. Soot, run. Vale, sit. Don’t blink.”

Inez blinked.

The hall emptied into a pond of whispered orders. Monkeys in uniforms poured up the stairs, down the stairs, through each other like mercury. She sat by the empty terrarium and placed one hand on the glass and counted to one hundred while Kettle hissed faintly in her satchel like it was jealous of a different machine. At twelve, she remembered the hair. At fourteen, she wished she could swallow herself. At thirty-eight she thought of the Petitions Rehearsal, the music they’d played, woodwinds and brass bright as a sunrise, while the Ministers practiced carrying baskets of nothing. At fifty-seven she thought of a schoolyard the day they banned balls.

They’d just said it, in letters pasted crooked to the walls: “No unsanctioned rolling objects.” That’s when the kids made balls from knotted rags and twined socks and fruit nets, and that’s when the game got better. But the decree had a silly effect: it made ball-shaped things into a kind of icon. You could shout “round!” in the Human Quarter and three teenagers would run, not from fear but from a vow.

By ninety-one she was thinking about the seam of the Football, the way it looked like a mouth if you tipped it sideways. Did mouths open when hungry? Did laws.

“Hey, Inez,” Soot said, suddenly at her shoulder. He held a leaf between finger and thumb, as if about to post it like a stamp. “They’re locking the river gates.”

“Uh-huh.”

“Want a story?”

“Not now.”

“It’s not about you,” he said, grinning. “It’s about a boy with three loquats and a bad habit of juggling in storms.”

She wanted to laugh and slap him and take the leaf out of his hand and read it. He put it on the edge of the terrarium, the leaf’s green veins like a tiny map of alleys. He leaned in. “Blue-finger came late,” he whispered. “His shirt was wrong-side-out. He smelled like mothballs and pepper. He asked for a tour of the vault. He said ‘the football is sacred’ like a man saying the name of a saint with a toothache.”

“And?”

“And I saw him again, an hour ago, on the rope bridge to the Stadium of the Dawn, carrying a basket of walnuts and nothing else at all. Nobody carries only one thing here.” He straightened, looked toward the roof. “If they call me again, I was never here.”

“If you were never here, you can take this,” Inez said, and slid the leaf into her notebook and put the notebook under her thigh.

The day broke its back, then dragged itself forward. The Ministers observed a temporary quiet. The Prime Arbiter closed his eyes and touched each finger in turn to his lips and then to the terrarium glass like a prayer broken into habit. Needle threw powder on thresholds; it stuck to footprints like snow in reverse, showing where the heat had gone, and where it returned, and where it hesitated by the window. Brigadier Plume shouted so loudly that a bluejay hiding in the rafters began to mimic him; now there were two Brigadiers, one with medals and one with feathers.

By noon the City had noticed. In the rope market a woman with a braid like a noose said, “They’ve canceled drums.” In the fruit lanes a boy traded something shaped like a ball wrapped in newspaper for a hand-scrawled map. On the ferry docks the gulls trailed a skiff into shadow. At the stadium, where the echoes liked to gather, a movement began as small as a collarbone, a shrug that wanted to become a storm. When a symbol disappears, you either fix the hole or make a better symbol. The City did not intend to be patched.

Inez copied notices. Inez took statements. Inez made the tea taste like lemon and sugar until the Brigadier said it was making everyone soft. She took a stack of petitions home in her satchel and walked like a person who had a job that mattered. She did not cut through the Human Quarter because she was not going to be the sort of person who hid from her own life, but then she turned at the laundry to avoid the rope fences, then she crossed the lane to avoid the dog and his owner, who always asked after her brother too loudly and with too much hope, then she took the alley behind the grease shop because it was cool and smelled like onions instead of the daylight.

Under a tin awning with a stripey shadow stood Miri, Inez’s friend in the sense that they shared three ongoing secrets and one dishpan and had on two occasions pressed their foreheads together to pretend the world would balance like a coin. Miri ran the free paper; she printed recipes and truisms and warnings, and she printed poems sometimes when a poet left a sack of chestnuts under her door. “You look like a letter that got wet and was left to dry wrong,” Miri said. “Did you see it? Did you hold it? Did you eat it?”

“What?” Inez said. “No. It’s a leaf.” She caught herself saying the thing about the leaf aloud, and they both laughed because she wasn’t funny, not really, except when she did not mean to be, and then she was cruel and tender at once.

“They’ll do something bad,” Miri said, flattening a sheet of paper. “You know that, yeah? They’ll say it’s for safety. They’ll say it’s temporary. They’ll call it a net and pretend that nets are blankets. They’ll pretend this is just wind.”

“They might not,” Inez said, because her mind was not a mind but a map and maps sometimes lied, leaving off the small paths that saved you. “The Prime Arbiter—he wants to taste, not bite.”

“Teeth are teeth,” Miri said. “You’ll tell me if they call curfew. I’ll run the headline.”

“I can’t,” Inez said. “You know I—”

“Can,” Miri said. “You can. Just don’t say it loud. Say it like a recipe under your breath. Two cups of flour, a pinch of salt, a curfew laid down like tar.”

Inez put her hand on Miri’s wrist, slight as a moth landing. Miri had ink on her thumb in the shape of a comma. “A boy with blue fingers,” Inez murmured. “A basket of walnuts.”

“Blue from what?” Miri asked. “Chemicals. Dyes. Or winter.”

“Pepper,” Inez said. “They said pepper. He came for a tour.”

Miri looked musical. “So we go to the stadium.”

“We?”

“You’ll need two eyes more. One to keep, one to share.”

They went. They went not like conspirators but like women who had errands; Miri brought a bag of laundry to fold (real laundry, shirts she would fold later), and Inez carried a stack of petitions, a sandwich wrapped in last week’s sports page, and the borrowed steadiness of someone else’s certainty. The rope bridges between the ministries and the Field Quarter swayed, humming. On the river below, a barge drifted, carrying a throne made of driftwood and empty crab traps. Two kids perched on the edge of the bridge and dropped pebbles until the gulls cursed them in a literary register.

At the Stadium of the Dawn, the gates were open and the concourse smelled like orange peels and old rain. Somebody had chalked a message on the wall in loops and stutters: A BALL IS JUST A PLAN WITH FEWER EDGES. Someone else had underlined it and scrawled: OR MORE JOY. In the bleachers, pigeons took their ease like little bureaucrats. The field was a fist of grass. The square where officials stood had been marked in white, though the marks were smudged with lots of practice and one incident with soup.

They walked the circumference. Miri pointed to a grated door. “Vault’s there, right? The Sky Vault. Where they keep the drums when it rains. Two guards in normal time. More when it matters.”

“Only lower ministers have keys,” Inez said, and then, because she had keys in a bag with a cruel joke embroidered on it, she could not breathe for a second from the weight of the implied thing.

They paused at a mural: five chimpanzees playing a game someone had once called democracy. The smudges were handprints. The handprints varied, some small like children, some large like the missing teeth in a palace lion. Someone had added a human hand at the edge, delicate as a spider, high as she could reach.

“Ladies,” a voice said. “No games today. Orders.” The guard was a colobus with a ribbon in his cap. He had fur blacker than a raven’s apology. His eyes were old and careful. Miri leaned and let her shopping bag swing. Laundry knocked the gate and made a music. “We’re visiting the echo,” she said. “You can’t quarantine an echo.”

He shrugged. “The echo’s left. There’s a man.” He corrected himself. “A person. No, a fellow. With blue on his fingers. I’ve never liked blue. Makes me think of sky. Sky makes me think of falling.”

“What did he ask for?” Inez asked.

“A tour,” the guard said. “And a place to wash his hands.”

A cloud slid over the sun and made the stadium a bowl of thought. Miri threaded her arm through Inez’s and said, “We should go to the old locker rooms. The ones they use as storage? The door with the lion’s head.” The lion’s head door had a knob that was a joke. You never needed to turn the knob; you pressed the cheekbone. That was locker room humor and deception. Inez had learned it when she first got the job and didn’t yet know which superstitions to respect.

The locker rooms smelled like rotting wood and victory. The floor was slick at the edges where old plumbing cried. Along one wall, the slogans of halftime years past peeled off like the skin on burned milk. She found the lion head and pressed the cheek and felt the hinge sigh. Inside, a shelf of balls. Cloth balls, leather balls, balls scuffed sober and balls new and cheap. Between them, a place where a bigger ball might have nestled once, though the dust line was not clean. She reached up and pulled down a ball the size of her loneliness, and it made no sound, and her hands shook, and she put it back because playthings had made this and playthings would unmake this if you weren’t careful.

“He had pepper,” Miri said.

The smell was faint, but it was there, caught in the corners of the room like a laugh. It made her sneeze. When she opened her eyes there was a mark on the wall, a palm print, three fingers, and a streak that dragged skyward like a note held too long. The blue was not paint. It was something else. Handsome. Dangerous if you believed in omens.

“It’s a dye they use to mark delinquents in the Rope Market,” Miri said. “Ink that won’t wash for days. Spill on your hands, you carry the rumor home. High-born monkeys don’t touch it, because if they did, they’d never be able to pretend again.” She squinted. “But we do. We’re the ones who carry.”

Inez touched the streak with the pad of her finger, then sucked it: pepper, yes. And something bitter, marine. The stadium’s bowels hummed. Somewhere above, a schoolteacher’s whistle cut the air. Through the small square of a window set high in the wall, she could see a slice of sky and three gulls in debate. A boy laughed and someone called his name: “Pel!”

They left the locker room and crossed the concourse again. Miri bought a paper cone of almonds from a man with an eyepatch and a patience. Inez repeated Soot’s words under her breath like a rhyme: He wore a shirt inside-out. He smelled like pepper. He said ‘sacred.’ He took the rope bridge. He carried walnuts like a decoy. He had blue on his hands like a confession he forgot to wash. She almost smacked into a woman carrying a tray of drinks. The tray had rings of dried lemon. One ring looked like a map in miniature, a river twisting through a city and splitting into a delta of alleys. She blinked. She looked again. It remained a lemon. So much for magic. You got what you worked for; you got what you deserved.

By the time she and Miri made their way back up toward the ministries, the day had hardened into proclamations. Soldiers with blue chalk on their boots stood at the corners with cheeks puffed, eyes scanning for crimes that would justify their assigned stance. A sign as tall as a lamppost had gone up at the Base of the Arch, where announcements were nailed and then pecked by birds. It read: TEMPORARY STABILIZATION MEASURE: ALL ROLLED OBJECTS TO BE REGISTERED. Curfew for Human Quarter. Rope bridge checkpoints enforce carrying limit: two items per crossing. Inez read the list and imagined all the ways it could be worse. Then she looked up. The Prime Arbiter’s seal glimmered at the bottom. That hurt more than she expected.

She went back to her desk to find that the velvet key bag had been moved a quarter inch and placed back exactly. The edge of her SALVATION phrase had frayed such that SALVATION looked like SALTATION if you were tired, and she was. She sat. Kettle’s keys were warm. She found the ledger where she had written the key-loaner list for the last month and put her finger on the last person’s name. The last person had been Minister of Sound, of course, because he liked to rub the ball and talk to it about music. She had written: 21:10, keys out, returned 21:15. The ink made a little dot of a worry mark after the five. She had pressed too long.

“Vale,” Brigadier Plume said from the doorway, with a softness that made her more afraid than shouting. “Come with me.”

He took her to the Amber Room, which was more like a shed with amber glass windows and amber light and little jars of bees preserved in amber like a warning about sweetness. The room was used for interrogations because it made you thirst. The Spymaster sat in the corner sewing a button on his jacket, which he did slowly enough for the slowness to be a message. The Prime Arbiter leaned against a cabinet and tried to look like a person who had wandered into a small sun by accident.

“You have keys,” the Brigadier said.

“I have responsibility,” Inez said, because sometimes the truth made different kinds of noise depending on when you said it.

“You are loyal,” the Prime Arbiter said. It was not a question or a command or relief.

“I am employed,” she said. And then, because she was not brave enough not to be brave, “I am loyal to what we say we are.”

“You make speeches you do not have to make,” Needle said, pulling the thread through his button and biting it off, and it sounded like praise and he meant it to sound like a scratch. “Tell us now, in your secretary’s tidy way, who this is.” He pushed a photograph across the table.

The photograph was the sort of thing you developed in a hurry and pretended you hadn’t. Grainy. A man, human, head turned, shirt indeed inside-out, hands down, fingers stained with something gray-black that the camera saw as blue. Not a face she knew. Not a face that didn’t have a cousin’s ear, a grandfather’s chin. She felt like a coin again, turning.

“I don’t know him,” she said. “But he knows something.”

“He knew how to walk up to a guard and say ‘may I see the Sky Vault,’ and to be told ‘no,’ and to change the no by smiling,” said the Brigadier, weirdly admiring. “He knew to throw pepper. Who throws pepper. Lovers and thieves.”

“Lovers,” Needle said.

“Thieves,” the Brigadier said.

The Prime Arbiter said nothing. He was looking at Inez’s hands and not at her face, and so she noticed her own ink under her nails and the small smear of blue at her knuckle like a promise. She put her hands under the table. She didn’t wipe them.

“Please,” she said finally, to the Prime Arbiter because he was the one whose ears were tuned to the please. “If you make this a net, it won’t hold water. It will only hold bodies. If you turn us into a list of rules, we will tear the page. I promise you. That’s not a threat. That’s just a weather report.”

He looked at her for a while as if she were a rare book that had been chewed by goats and therefore maybe more important for its scars. “Tell me why.”

“Because the ball is not yours,” she said. “It belongs to the idea that we are interesting together.” She clamped her mouth shut. The Brigadier laughed out loud and made a small delighted monkey noise that she liked in spite of herself. Needle put his button into its hole and twisted it twice as if to anchor himself.

“Very well,” the Prime Arbiter said. “Brigadier, do not build a net that will catch more than wind. Needle, appoint two eyes. Vale, you are one.”

“Sir,” the Brigadier said, without eyebrows.

“Sir,” Needle said, with eyebrows.

“Sir,” Inez said, with what felt like more air in her lungs.

“Bring me my day back,” said the Prime Arbiter, and left.

They gave her nothing but a cloak that was too short and a card that said YOU MAY PASS: SPECIAL, which was the least useful thing anyone could hand you in a city of exceptions. They gave her Soot to run at her heels and trip her, and nothing else. She went home to her room above the bakery where the heat never quite slept, and she found a letter slid under her door. It was written on the wrapper from a block of soap. The handwriting looked like someone had written while walking: wobbles, the sudden cliff of a letter abandoned mid-stroke.

Heard the ministers lost their toy, the letter said. He turned it into a quiet. Come to the broken goalposts at dusk. And bring the velvet bag. —P

She sat on the bed and let the day tilt her forward. P could be a man with blue hands. P could be Pel, the kid with the laugh like a skipping stone. P could be somebody she had been without knowing it. She took out the velvet bag and laid it on the bed. SALVATION IS PUNCTUALITY, it said. It looked like a threat now. Fabric shifted. Thread hummed. A blackbird sang outside like a rusty hinge greased. Downstairs, the bakery oven thumped as it ate wood.

“You’re not going,” she told herself.

She went.

The broken goalposts were in the schoolyard where they’d banned balls. Someone had cut the posts years ago, leaving two teeth pointing at a sky that didn’t answer letters. There were chalk circles on the ground from last month’s protests against the rope tithes; children had used those circles as targets for hop and skip, because children understood the reusability of pain. There were teenagers making a game with a plastic bottle that had been cut into a flat spiral; when it flew, it hummed. A man in a hat too large stood by the far fence, and he looked like someone who had just lost something and was pretending otherwise.

“I’m here,” Inez said, which was a ridiculous thing to say in a public place. He turned. Blue under the nails. Blue along the cuticles. Pepper in his shirt. He was not beautiful, which made her want to trust him. He was not ugly either, which made her want to run.

“You’re late,” he said. “Which is good. Means you could have chosen not to come and then chose harder.”

“Who are you.”

“Pel,” he said. “Perlico. Perrin. Pick one. My mother wanted a name you could shout. She got one.” He did not offer his hand, which was good, because she did not know whether she’d have taken it. “You have the velvet bag?”

“You have the ball?” she said, and watched his mouth twitch, as if humor were a language he hadn’t practiced in years and now found on his tongue in exactly the wrong dialect.

“I have something else,” he said. “And a promise to make.”

“Promises are expensive,” she said.

“And yet,” he said. “Your bosses plan to tax the wind next year. We all make mistakes.”

He took her to the edge of the yard where the fence had lost a nail and become a hinge. He slid through. She followed, because you either follow a story or you do not, and if you do not, the story tells you anyway and calls you coward in the footnotes. They ducked down an alley with walls whitewashed and then written on in a thousand shades of chalk. The words didn’t matter. The fact of them did. In a city where someone controlled the drums, someone else would always write on the walls. Pel counted his breaths. He did it out loud. She hated him and liked him for that. She counted her steps, in case she had to go back alone.

They came to a door that had rust for eyelashes. Pel tapped a sequence on the wood, not special, just the way a person who wanted to pretend to belong would tap. Inside was a room that had once been a classroom or a waiting room or a storage closet full of chairs and later a different thing. Now it contained a table with two apples, a pile of newspapers from a week she would rather forget, three small paintings of rivers, and, on a shelf, a leather rectangle with brass corners.

“Don’t,” she said before he touched it.

“We don’t have it,” he said. “We never had it. We had a rumor. We have this.” He nodded at the leather rectangle. “And a favor.”

She went to the shelf. The leather was old-luxury. The kind of thing the early ministers had carried when they were playing at government with too much costume. It smelled like glove and dentist’s office. She opened it. Inside, three pages. Rules. The kind of rules written by people who already believed they were right and just wanted a marching song to keep tempo. “Property of the Gymnasium,” it said. The last line read: IF THE BALL IS LOST, DO NOT BLAME THE FIELD.

“Not funny,” she said, because everything in her wanted to laugh until her nose bled.

“It’s the only copy,” Pel said. “That we have. We think the ministers have the vellum. We think the vellum is a con. We think the con is the glue that keeps their shape. We think if we break the glue, they fall apart.”

“We.” She tasted the word. It had spice in it. “Who is we.”

“Players,” he said. “Not the children, not the stadium guards. The in-betweeners. The ones who cross lines. Couriers. Sweepers. Archivists who keep the bad copies to save the truth. We’ve been waiting for a swing and a miss. They missed. The ball is not gone. It is going. It is in motion. We do not have it. I swear. But we know who does.”

He let her name hang until she took it. “Who.”

“A monkey,” he said. “The kind you don’t notice anymore because he is furniture. A marmoset with a limp. He sleeps in the rafters over your desk. He has a scar on his wrist from a kettle. He smells like copy ink and pepper.”

“Soot,” she said, before she could stop herself.

And when she did, the city tilted for the second time that day, and the first hairline crack in the judgment she kept about the world widened just enough to let weather through. She had to lean against the table so she did not spill.

“You like him,” Pel said. He didn’t make it ugly. Just factual. Like a weather report.

“He likes to run,” she said. “He tells stories. He told me to not.”

“He told me to do,” Pel said, almost smiling. “So we are agreed. He’s too smart to want the world as it is.”

She thought of Soot’s scabbed ear. She thought of the leaf he had left like a breadcrumb. She thought of her own hands stinking of pepper in a locker room where ghosts lined up to catch the ball after the whistle. It made her tired. It made her want to stand in a field and throw something until her arms shook.

“What is the favor,” she asked.

“Protect him,” Pel said. “We will try to break your government without breaking your bones. We will fail sometimes. So you will help us fail less. And when we finish, you can write the minutes.”

“And the velvet bag?”

“Use it,” he said. “Near the rope bridge. At the hour when the gulls argue the loudest. Put the bag on the railing. The one with the carved initials. Then walk away. Someone will pick it up. It will not be me.”

“This is stupid,” she said.

“Yes,” he said. “It is also how we won the last three times. We move. We play.”

“I can’t,” she said.

“You can,” he said, and he said it like a person who did not know the shape of her day, and maybe that was good because it left room for her to shape it herself.

She took the leather rectangle. It was heavier than it looked. She felt like a thief and a clerk simultaneously. That is to say: like herself. She stepped back into the alley. The chalk, under her boots, smeared into something that could have been a word if they’d had more time. The sun flared, and the drops of last night’s rain still clinging to the wire fence burned like little mirrors. She put the bag inside her shirt. She walked back toward the parliament trees, where the gulls were starting to gather as if they smelled story.

When she reached the rope bridge, the gulls were at it, intense and personal. The river below ran black-green with seriousness. The checkpoint guard was new and tried to outstare her name card and lost. “Special,” he read, as if the word were a slur. “Proceed,” he said, as if the slur were a title. She went to the railing with the initials. B + H had carved their love into wood five summers ago; the B was splintering. She put the velvet bag there. She closed her hands as if in prayer and opened them and let the bag go like a breath.

She walked away. She did not look. She looked at the knot in the rope, at the tar where someone had patched a frayed spot, at the place where the bridge shook when boats passed under. She counted. One, two, three, four. A pause. The long kind. Seven, eight. A gull screamed a profanity at a barge. Nine, ten. She stepped off the bridge and turned the corner and almost ran into Soot.

He carried a basket of walnuts and a look like he’d swallowed a whistle. The walnuts were not a decoy; they were just walnuts. The look was not a decoy either. He saw her, saw her eyes go to the basket, and did a little shrug with his eyebrow and his shoulder, like a man admitting his shirt was indeed inside-out. “Hey, Inez,” he said. “They want you in the Amber Room again. Someone found a feather in the terrarium.”

“A feather,” she repeated, because when all else failed, you could repeat like a child echoing. He nodded. His ear scabbed again. His hand brushed the rope of the bridge and came away dusty-blue. He wiped it on his shirt and the blue did not come off. He looked at his hand and he looked at her and he did not smile and he did not frown and he did not look away. He just added one sentence to the inside of her skull forever: “You are not the only one counting.”

He slipped past her with the basket like time carrying the day away. Behind her, something in the space where the velvet bag had been made a soft, obscure sound. She didn’t turn. She didn’t have to. The whole city was turning; the whole city knew. Lights went on early on Rope Lane. Someone wet a finger and held it up to the wind, and the wind chose its direction. In a nearby office, Kettle hissed like an animal that had learned a new word. Up in the rafters of the parliament trees, a small marmoset with blue on his knuckles paused in a story and swallowed the next line.

Inez went back inside. She kept her head down. She kept the leather rectangle under her heart and the day above it, and she went to the Amber Room in time to hear the Prime Arbiter say, to the room and to the world: “We will not panic,” in a voice that had room in it for panic and its twin, a word for which the City had yet to make a law.The Amber Room was fuller now, which made its thirst multiply. Ministers stood with their backs to amber panes and looked like saints caught in honey, righteous and preserved. The Brigadier had shed his jacket and revealed a shirt that looked like it had opinions about bayonets. Needle had acquired a second needle and was using both to pick something out of his teeth with absent delicacy. The Prime Arbiter had a cup of water and was not drinking it because to drink would be to admit he was thirsty, and to admit thirst would be to confess that the room worked.

Inez put the leather rectangle on the table before anyone asked. She did it the way you set down a child you want to keep but know you can’t carry into every room. The brass corners tapped once, twice. Needle had the hands of a thief and the caution of a librarian; he opened it without creasing the spine. The Brigadier leaned in. The Prime Arbiter stayed where he was; distance was his best instrument.

“Property of the Gymnasium,” Needle read, and raised one brow at the Brigadier’s snort. He flipped a page. “Regulations for Public Contestation of Rule. God, the early tone. Listen to this: ‘The Sphere shall be of sufficient heft to resist flippancy.’ Who writes like that.”

“Dead chimps,” the Brigadier said. “Let’s not let them rule us again.”

“Keep reading, please,” the Prime Arbiter murmured, the please meant for Inez as much as for the Spymaster.

Needle obliged, and the room pressed closer to language. “Aha. ‘If the Sphere be mislaid, stolen, eaten by dog, or otherwise under providence absent, a Substitute may be named by seven witnesses unaligned to any single order. The Substitute must be circled thrice, sung over once, and flung in good faith. In absence of seven, a quorum of disinterested lamp posts shall suffice.’” He paused, head tipped, as if listening for laughter from fifty years ago.

“A quorum of—” the Brigadier began.

“Lamp posts,” Needle confirmed. “The early ministers were funnier than we permit ourselves to recall.”

“Seven witnesses unaligned,” the Prime Arbiter said. He had not moved, but his voice wandered around the room, putting its finger on every shoulder. “We can do this. We can do this now.”

“We cannot,” the Brigadier said. “If we do this, we telegraph softness. We encourage chaos to dress up as custom. We say, with a grin, ‘steal us again, and we will sing over a spoon.’”

“What is the alternative?” the Prime Arbiter asked, and there was a real question in it. “Lock the river and watch what happens when people are handed a list instead of a loaf?”

“Orders keep boats from ramming each other,” the Brigadier said. “Lists keep panic in a hat.”

Inez did not ask to speak because she had learned the trick of not asking. “If you say no, then you have nothing today but uniforms. If you say yes, you have a harvest you can ratify with a rag ball and a story. You can call the rag ball ‘the Rag.’ You can make them love you. You can make them hate you more slowly.”

“Rag,” Needle repeated, savoring the word. “Rag as object and insult. Rag as mercy. Rag as trap.”

“It is not mercy to use a child’s toy,” the Brigadier said, jaw setting. “It is insult.”

“It is a door,” the Prime Arbiter said. “We invented doors to avoid climbing out the window.”

Needle slid the leather rectangle toward Inez. “This is contraband,” he said conversationally. “Where did you pick its pocket?”

She did not answer, which was answer enough, and he nodded to tell her he appreciated the silence like a gift he wouldn’t have chosen but was willing to ugly-cherish. The Prime Arbiter set his untouched water down. He laid two fingers on the cover and then lifted them and wiped them on his sleeve, regretting everything sticky.

“Find me seven,” he said. “Seven witnesses unaligned. Vale, you are one. Brigadier, you cannot be. Needle, you cannot be. We will not pack the room with our own shadows.”

“The lamp posts are disinterested,” Needle offered, dry.

“Lamp posts can’t hum,” the Brigadier said, but his voice had lost an edge. He had been caught enjoying the game.

“Lamp posts are exhausted,” Inez said. “We use them too often.” She swallowed. “Minister of Snack has a wife in the Rope Market. She is not aligned. The ferry captain known as Two-Tides. The head of the Free Paper.” She didn’t look at Needle. She didn’t look at anything. “A monk from the salt fields, but the kind that eats fish. The boy who sweeps the stadium stairs, the one who can tell you every echo by flavor. A carpenter who hates his own thumbs.”

“You have a list of people who can bear witness?” the Brigadier said. “In your pocket?”

“Every secretary does,” she said, and the room endured a small laugh it had not earned.

The Prime Arbiter closed his eyes briefly in a gesture that contained prayer, apology, and calculation in equal thirds. He opened them and nodded. “Do it. We make a Rag. We drum softly, with feet if we must, and we tell a story about our resilience that leaves room for improvement and for shame.”

The Brigadier’s stare could have polished brass. “You know what happens when we let the City tease power out of our hands like a handkerchief.”

“It learns to be pleased with its own cleverness and forgives us for thinking we were a wall instead of a door,” the Prime Arbiter said. “We can survive pleasure. Panic’s twin is poise.”

At the edge of the light, Soot was the kind of shadow a person would step over without seeing. He had the basket of walnuts balanced against a hip the way a dancer balances a partner’s certainty. He had blue along his knuckles like a bruise in an unusual language. When the Prime Arbiter finished and the room broke into orders without agreement, Soot brought the walnuts to Inez and set them on the table as if that were a normal chore in a normal afternoon.

“They asked me to bring these so we’d look civilized,” he said, cheek creasing. “We never look civilized when we share.”

“Don’t do this,” she said into the small air between them. “Whatever you’re doing, don’t do it alone.”

“I never do anything alone,” he said, and for a moment it was a kindness and then it was a warning. “Also, you dropped your embroidery. It looked nice on the bridge. You should be proud.”

“It suited the wood,” she said, because what else could you say about betraying objects to make a day less breakable. He reached for a walnut and cracked it clean with the heel of his hand and ate the meat in two small bites like a secret.

“Don’t put me on your list,” he whispered, as the Brigadier began to hem the air into commands. “I am not a witness. I am a rumor walking around.”

She did not promise. She nodded as if that were a promise, and when he left he left a smell like pepper sharpening an orange.

The City’s dusk arrived in armor. Curfew notices fluttered and stuck themselves to lampposts like gray moths. The gulls fought for rank above the river and produced a hierarchy within five minutes, which should have embarrassed everyone below. The rope bridges groaned and settled and sighed the way a body sighs when it has been braced all day and accepts that bracing will not end. Miri folded papers that said, on the front page above an essay about pancakes: WHAT WE CALL A NET IS A KIND OF MAP. At the bottom, in letters so small that only people who needed them would notice, she had printed a recipe for Rag: three rags, one sock, a fist of string, and a wish not to be arrested.

Inez’s list became feet. She found the ferry captain Two-Tides in the dock office taking bets against rain and pretended to be asking about a cousin; he agreed with his entire mustache. She found the Minister of Snack’s wife schooling a ribbon into an impossible braid and was told she would come if she could bring her niece, and Inez said, fine, yes, bring the niece if the niece could hold a witness in each hand without dropping one. The monk she found by following the smell of brine and the sound of an argument with a crab; he said the ball was a sin and so was celery but the harvest should be ratified; he would come. The stadium sweeper was already at the stadium, which should have made him easy, except he was moving and moving things either chased you or forgave you. The carpenter who hated his own thumbs had remarried and claimed his thumbs were better now, but the hate had moved to his wrists and would suffice.

By the time the seven were gathered and named and fed one slice of orange each because oranges are a thing you can divide without spilling, the Brigadier had committed to the Rag with the woundedness of a man forced to prefer a useful thing to a glorious one. Needle had opinions about songs. The Prime Arbiter had found his coat again, which meant he was ready to be a person you could look at and feel contained. Soot disappeared twice and reappeared once. Pel did not appear, which was what he had promised.

They made the Rag in the corridor outside the Hall, because there was no rule about where you could manufacture a ceremonial object and if there had been, it would have been ignored. Miri did the stitching with thread pulled from her skirt and teeth. The stadium sweeper, who introduced himself as Quin and then as Quill and then as Qili because his name changed depending on whether you wanted to underestimate him, rounded the ball with his hands until it looked like weather waiting to happen. The Minister of Snack’s niece, whose name was Poppy unless you were cross with her, pronounced it round enough only after it rolled properly, not too eager, not too stubborn. The monk hummed a scale. The ferry captain whistled a counter. Seven people sang, and no lamp post had to work overtime.

“Circle thrice,” Needle prompted.

“Which direction,” the Brigadier asked, which made the Prime Arbiter look suddenly very tired.

“Sunwise,” Inez said. “We’re already borrowing, let’s borrow luck.”

They circled. The Rag sat in the center of the polished floor like it wanted to learn a new verb. The amber windows watched. The terrarium, empty as a lie that has been discovered, reflected the lights in its glass so that for a second it looked full of stars.

When they were done, when the song failed charmingly at the high part because the monk laughed and everyone else joined, the Prime Arbiter lifted the Rag. He held it with both hands because even when you have a substitute you can respect the thing you made. He looked at the Brigadier. The Brigadier looked at the Rag the way a hunter looks at a fish he has just accidentally saved. Needle cocked his head like a secret that has decided to confess itself in stages.

“Let’s ratify,” the Prime Arbiter said. “Soft feet. No drums. We stamp and shuffle and hum. We make the law without noise.”

“We make noise without law afterward,” the Brigadier muttered, but he nodded.

They entered the Hall. The Ministers were already arranged by order and by orderliness. The seats were carved with the faces of dead primates whose eyes had been sanded down to make them less accusatory. The terrarium glinted. The empty corner where the Football had lived worked like a missing tooth you could not stop tonguing. Inez stood at the wall with Kettle’s satchel looped over one shoulder and tried to be a shadow with a typewriter problem.

The first stamp went through her like medicine and like a dare. Twenty-seven sets of feet found the same beat by accident and then on purpose. The Rag rolled. The Rag behaved like a ball. It found a seam in the floor and followed it and then chose another. It bumped the base of a column that had been named after a bird and changed its mind. It made decisions. It let itself be herded. It escaped. It performed the genius act of being simple.

Soot was nowhere. Soot was everywhere. She kept seeing a tail that might have been his, a shoulder that could belong to any runner, the flick of an ear. Her stomach had learned a new language and was using it to ask whether she was a fool. Kettle hissed once, softly, like a kettle. She thought of the leather rectangle under her coat and of the way the line about lamp posts had made everyone a little happier than they meant to be.

They were two votes from harvest when the Rag went wrong. It made a sound no cloth thing should make, a chink like teeth meeting teeth, a small mechanical apology. It hit a patch of powder and left a print in it that looked like a constellation. It wobbled and righted itself and went on, and nobody said anything because to acknowledge error during ceremony is to invite the geese to die again, and they were all done with geese. But the Brigadier heard. He did not flinch, but he did not forget.

After, after the humming and the stamping and the seven witnesses saying “aye” in seven different accents, after the Minister of Sound made a speech about humility that was a little too long, after the Minister of Snack pretended the Rag was delicious, after the Prime Arbiter took off his coat again and laughed like a man who hit the right note at last, Inez picked up the Rag and felt its bones. They were not bones. They were little buttons sewn inside, and under the buttons something harder, the weight of a day’s deceit.

She looked up and met Needle’s eyes. He had felt it too. He nodded at her chaise-longue-level glance, the kind that says not now and also says always.

They had given the Rag a spine. It had to stand up to the Hall, after all. But what spine, and whose. She took it to the corridor and handed it to Miri, who shook it once like a scarf and heard the story of the chink. “Someone smuggled sense into a rag,” Miri said, thoughtful. “Or contraband into a ceremony.”

“Sense would be welcome,” Inez said. “Contraband would be an insult.”

“Contraband can be a kind of love,” Miri replied, not to be contrary but because truth insisted on more rooms than they had built.

They did not get long to admire their own audacity. Guards moved, which is what guards do when clocks change. Orders identified themselves as measures and then as polite requests and then as negotiations with air. A runner who was not Soot fetched the Prime Arbiter to the door with the lion’s head. Needle slipped out of a conversation with a furious tamarin and reappeared at Inez’s shoulder like the memory of a theft no one wanted to prosecute.

“Your bag had company,” he said without prelude. “A hand took it. The bag walked.”

“That was the point,” she said.

“So was this,” he said, and put into her palm a brass star the size of a raisin. It had a rivet hole. It smelled like banana oil and old applause. “We found it under the long bench. The Rag had a passenger, and either the Rag stole it, or someone sewed it in, or things are coming home to roost.”

She closed her fingers around the star. It pricked. It did not pierce. “If it’s from the Football—”

“Then the Football is molting,” Needle said. “Which means either it is shedding independence or it is falling apart.”

Soot whistled from the end of the corridor. He waved the way boys wave when they are pretending to be men, short and sideways, half asking permission and half inviting trouble. Inez pocketed the star and followed him because she had decided this was a day for following.

He did not lead her to the rafters, as she worried and then wanted. He took her down a back stair to the Sky Vault, where the drums slept when it rained. The grating wore chalk like a kind of proud dust. The guard was the colobus with the raven eyes in his ribboned cap. He looked at Inez and then at Soot and then at the space between them where some third thing was living.

“They used the velvet,” Soot said, speaking as if he named a tool and not a sin. “A string. Not yours. A copy. They made a copy of an absence and used it to pull the latch.”

The lock had indeed been worked by a seduction disguised as thread. It hung open. Inside, where the drums lived, there were footprints in powder going toward nothing and coming back with nothing and pausing by a wall as if listening to the wall’s opinion. The smell was pepper, lemon, a hint of mothballs, and that bitter marine taste that made your mouth feel like a ship with a hole just above the waterline.

“They took the quiet,” the guard said, distraught in an understated way. “The special quiet. You know the quiet, Miss Vale? The one we lay over the drums so the city doesn’t hear its own rehearsal.”

“The mufflers,” she said. “The skins.”

“Gone,” he said. “They’ll pound against air tonight, and air will tell them everything.”

Soot leaned on the jamb and did not look innocent because innocence had stopped fitting him. “You left a lever where a story could find it,” he told the guard, not unkindly. “Stories are stronger than locks.”

The mufflers mattered less because of sound and more because of message. Drums would be heard all over the City when the guards did their midnight practice, which meant the City would confirm its own suspicion: that weapons do not sleep. Kettle hissed from her satchel like a cat in a church. Inez knelt and put her fingers into the powder and made a picture of Soot’s steps next to the others. His step was light; the other step dragged its right foot like a regret.

“You can still stop the rumor,” she said, standing. “You can say it was an accident. You can say the mufflers were damp and we dried them in the sun. You can say the sky ate them. People like sky-eating.”

“You are loyal,” the guard said, not ironic and not praising. Just a ledger entry.

She and Soot left. On the stair he stopped and did not turn, and when he spoke he did it to the wall, which has a way of curing honesty of its theatricality. “You wanted to know if I stole a ball,” he said. “I did not. I would have. But I did not. I helped it roll.”

“Where,” she said.

“Away,” he said. “Not out. Just away. This is a test. Pel will never admit to it because he loves tests and hates tests, and that makes him untrustworthy. But listen: the Football is a weather vane. We turned the wind.”

“Why tell me,” she asked. “Why not let me choke on it. That seems to be the season.”

He put his burned wrist against the stone and pressed. The scar looked like punctuation, a semicolon outside of a sentence. “Because your bag on the bridge said you could be trusted to stop us from overbelieving in ourselves. And because I like you. And because you will not make the error of mistaking spectacle for salvation.”

The hour after sunset became the hour the City would name, later, in plays and lies. It was the hour of small hands. Children whose parents had told them to sleep found the floor a better geography and put their ears to it to hear the new way drums spoke when nothing muffled them. On the rope bridges, couples stopped in the middle and kissed out of sequence, because danger interrupted their schedules. In the Human Quarter, a string of lights blinked on one by one and became a code nobody admitted to writing. At the stadium, someone kicked a melon into the dark and swore it came back better.

Inez met Miri under the striped awning, because Miri had a thermos and thermoses turn tongues into tools. They wrapped their hands around the heat. They looked like women in a painting about the moment before the storm.

“You made a law with a Rag,” Miri said. “Even the wire in my teeth is cheering.”

“It wasn’t enough,” Inez said. “It was enough for now.”

“Words love tenses,” Miri said. “They’ll forgive you for picking the wrong one, as long as you come back.”

Inez showed her the brass star. It lay on Miri’s palm like an idea you could choke on. Miri put it against her mouth for a second, to taste the old oil and the ugly shine. “You like objects too much,” she said fondly. “If you married one, I would have to object at the part where the official says ‘may anyone here speak now.’”

“If I married this star, I would only be marrying ambition,” Inez said. “I’ve already tried that.”

The drums began to practice their practice. The sound came up through the grate of the city like water seeking every crack. It found shoulders. It found windows. It found the river and lay on it like a second skin until the river did a thing nobody had seen: it grinned. Gulls lost their place in line and scrambled to make a new one. The Brigadier, somewhere high and mad and ecstatic, shouted a command that a parrot on a balcony repeated perfectly and then improved with profanity.

People came into the street. People listened. People put their hands on drums they did not own, on pots, on doors, on their own chests. Soot climbed a lamppost and sat like a punctuation at the top of the statement the City was making. Pel, if he lived, kept away. Needle moved like a person not moving. The Prime Arbiter stood in the High Window and did not smile because the windows watched that too. Inez had the feeling you get in a boat when the wave you didn’t know you wanted finds you.

“Curfew,” a guard called, half-hearted because he was human and had been a boy who once wanted to be a drum. “Curfew,” he called again, and fewer people heard him, because the resonance had invaded their inventory of attention.

“Take your free paper,” Miri shouted, because she had to remember to feed her work while the city fed its longing. “Pancakes on page one, a recipe for Rag on page seven, something that looks like a poem on page three if you squint.”

A child took a copy and did not squint. He read aloud a line about lamp posts as if he had been doing that all his life and just now had been paid.

In the window of the Amber Room, the terrarium flashed a brief, impossible light. Inez saw it and went on seeing it, which is different from saying it happened. She left Miri with the thermos and the poem and took the alley that knew her name. Soot followed without speaking. They reached the room with the bees-in-amber and found it empty of bodies and full of afterthought. The terrarium was as it had been, latch hanging like a tongue, condensation making clouds of breath. But at the bottom of the glass, against the curve, there was a crescent of mud that hadn’t been there. Mud with blue in it, as if sky had been mixed with soil by a child who refused to separate heaven and ground.

“They fed the case,” Soot said, reverential. “They fed it like a pet.”

“Or like a god,” Inez said, which thankfully did not get her struck by anything visible. She touched the glass. It gave no sign. She crouched and peered and saw, stuck to the inner seam in the shadow where a seam becomes a throat, a sliver of vellum, a thread, an edge. The upstitched part of a scroll that a hand had touched recently, or an image she conjured because she needed to. Her mind made threats; her mind made relief.

“Later,” Soot said. “When there is later. Inez—”

He stopped himself. He did the thing where a body backs out of a sentence to avoid stepping on a truth too big for its shoes. He put his hand on the glass because she had, and if that was a sacrilege then they were both already holy.

Down below, the drums learned their own names and called them back. The Rag lay in its place of honor, imperfect, doing its job, humming the small song it had been taught. The City, caught between panic and poise, gave itself permission to be a better audience. The ministers tried to act nonplussed and failed. Gulls rewrote the sky. The river smiled again and did not apologize.

In the Human Quarter, the rope fences looked like tired promises. A boy practiced juggling loquats in the dark and dropped only two. Someone wrote on a wall: IF THE BALL IS LOST, DO NOT BLAME THE FIELD, and under it someone else wrote: DO NOT BLAME THE FIELD, BUT DO REMEMBER ITS SHAPE. In the office of the Prime Arbiter, the leather rectangle sat for the first time on the desk it had always believed it deserved and did not warp under the weight of that belief. The Brigadier watched the drums and put his hand on his own chest in time, not because he couldn’t help it but because he refused not to.

“Tomorrow,” Miri said into Inez’s neck when they found each other again the way needles find magnets. “Tomorrow they’ll say they permitted this.”

“Maybe they did,” Inez said. “Maybe permission was the only trick we needed, as long as we pretend we didn’t ask for it.”

“I don’t care who gets to write the headline,” Miri said, which was a lie and a promise and a beautiful one. “Are you safe.”

“No,” Inez said. “But also yes.”

“Good,” Miri said. “Safety is a bowl. We need a field.”

They stood with their hands around the thermos and watched the City feed itself a sound it had not gotten from permission in a long time. Soot laughed once, high in his lamppost, and the laugh had a crack in it that promised both courage and exhaustion. Needle appeared long enough to press something small into Inez’s palm—a key that did not look like any lock she knew—and then vanished in the direction of a hallway that did not exist on paper. The Prime Arbiter left the window and joined the street and walked without guards for four minutes and then had guards again, as if four minutes were a ritual and not a lapse.

When the drums stopped, the silence was the kind that frenched the edges of words. People went inside because they were told to and because they wanted to and because there would be breakfast in the morning. The City curled itself into a reasonable shape. Inez took Soot’s arm without asking permission and felt him tense and then not. They went up to the rafters and shared a walnut and told each other three kinds of lies to soothe the truth. She climbed down with blue on her hands like a courtesy she had accepted.

That night, in the room above the bakery where heat was a relative that overstayed, she took out the leather rectangle and opened to the page with lamp posts and laughed for a long time until the laugh became something else. When she tired, when the oven below thumped in its sleep, she placed the brass star in the seam of the book and closed it. The star made a small bruise in the leather, a constellation of one. She set the book under her pillow because she was a child and a clerk and a spy and a woman who was going to sleep and wanted a story to prop up her head. Just before sleep claimed the part of her that required lists, she thought: I am not the only one counting, and made room in her mouth for a word that would be told to her later and that she would be asked to say out loud into a room full of amber and hunger and ears.Chapter 5

At dawn the bakery below her room cracked open like a seed, and the heat came up soft and adhesive, smelling of cinnamon, wet flour, and woodsmoke that had read a fairy tale before burning. Inez woke with the leather rectangle hard under her pillow and a crescent of the brass star pressing her cheek through the casing like a shy moon begging to be named. The drum-practice residue in the air made the room seem closer to the street than it was, as if the stairwell had been replaced in the night with a pipe for sound and rumor. She listened for the gulls and for the rhythm the city had found and for the small household noises that kept her tethered to being a person, and in the slot between two breaths she remembered that she had promised everything to too many people in too few words.

She set the leather book on the bedside table, balanced the brass star on its spine to make herself look at both at once, and waited for the feeling of ownership to pass. It did not pass and did not grow; it just nested. The key Needle had slipped into her hand lay on the windowsill, a shape that wanted to be ordinary but had been made by a smith who mistrusted straight lines. Kettle sat in the satchel by the chair, the ribbon ink a smell like pianos and old lab benches, and when she brushed the lid in apology it gave her its usual hiss, the sound of a kettle and a cat and a valve refusing to stick. She pulled on yesterday’s blouse because it already knew which way the day would lean and relaced the boots that had learned to keep quiet, and she told herself that if the Rag had been accepted once it could be accepted twice, in which case they had a calendar and not a moment.

On Rope Lane the curfew notices had been worried into lace at the corners by fingers that would never obey paper. Men in uniforms with blue in their boot treads wore the faces of people who hoped to be thanked for being necessary, and women with baskets wore the faces of people who suspected necessity was a jacket the powerful liked to try on and never hang up. Miri had chalked a cat on the shutter of the free paper shop and then pretended she hadn’t, and two children took turns giving it different names until the names became a game and not a cat. Soot was on the lamppost level with her window, crouched where iron meets sky, his tail wrapped around and back like a sentence that refused to stop at the period, and when he saw her he tapped the pole with his knuckles so softly it made more suggestion than sound.

He dropped the rest of the way in three motions and presented her with nothing but a grin and a stain of blue that had migrated to his forearm during the night. “They’re counting lamp posts,” he said, which had the effect of a nonsense riddle until you remembered the page in the leather rectangle and the way the city had laughed in its throat.

“Counting them for what,” she asked, as if there might be a decent answer, and he rolled his wrist like a man testing a trick coin and said, “To see how many are disinterested. Some want to be statues now that they’ve been in a law. Needle’s boys are listening to iron for bias, and Pel says that’s the best joke he didn’t write.”

“You saw Pel,” she said, because the name came out of her mouth like a fruit she had been pretending not to have in her pocket.

“I saw a rumor with his legs,” Soot said, and for a heartbeat he looked older than the stories he loved, which she filed for later because later was where she stored the achey truths. “He’s working the field lines, not the square. He has a sleeve full of dye and a plan full of holes and he wants to put the Football somewhere it can listen.”

“Balls don’t listen,” Inez said, which was the kind of thing a child says to feel adult and an adult says to feel wise, and Soot replied, “They do when you whisper with your feet,” which she hated for being beautiful and for stabbing at her certainty.

She had meant to go to work by the straightest rope and with her mouth closed, but Miri was a sign hung under a striped awning, and the sign said: tea first or you will misname three things before noon. The free paper’s door stuck at the top where heat made the wood talk, and when she shoved it she felt the pleasant resistance of a small daily fight with an inanimate thing. Miri turned from the press with ink on her lip like a mark from a lover you didn’t notice until you were already in public, and she pressed the thermos into Inez’s hand before any words could begin the day badly.

“They’re calling the Rag blasphemy,” she said, no prelude, because friends didn’t prelude when the situation got vaudeville. “They’re also calling it ingenious. And a sign of weakness. And a sign of mercy. And a sack of laundry, which is accurate and also missing the point. I printed an extra run of pancakes to disguise the essays. Do you want to say something they’ll pretend they discovered themselves.”

“I want seven witness-throats for tonight’s petitions,” Inez said, surprising herself by answering a different question. “I want to keep the Rag in the hall instead of letting them shelve it in the Vault of Alternates and pretend it never worked. I want to stop the Brigadier from inventing nets and calling them heirlooms. And Needle gave me a key that fits nothing I own.”

Miri was the kind of person whose eyebrows could have a conversation on your behalf. They did a small parley with her hairline and then returned. “Show me the key,” she said, and when Inez set it on the counter between a pile of broadsides and a jar of licorice rope, she bent to it as if to smell a wine she didn’t trust. “It’s a strike key,” Miri announced, not triumphant, just pleased to find vocabulary at the right time, and when Inez frowned she added, “From the days when the lamps were lit by people and not by bribed electricity. You use it on the collars.”

“The collars,” Inez repeated, because an echo buys time to make a plan, and Miri pointed with her chin toward the street where the lampposts stood with their cast-iron anonymity. “There,” she said. “Look at the base. There’s a ring. In the oldest ones they hid a slot to let lamplighters oil the necks. Later, the slot became a hiding place for love letters and bribes and, once, an eel. Open a collar and you could put a thing inside that needed to hear something. Or you could take out what someone else hid and pretend you never learned how to open anything.”

Inez held the key up to the light and let the morning find its oddities. It had a tooth like a question mark and a bow shaped like a lopsided ear, and in the barrel there was a fleck of blue as if it had been dipped in rumor. She folded it into her palm and gave Miri the brass star, just for a second, to shift the gravity around inside the moment. “We’re looking for a seam in the seam,” she said. “Soot says the Football is not gone, just going, and the Rag had a grammar under its bones, and the terrarium is being fed.”

“Who is feeding it,” Miri asked, and Inez said, “Either reverence or fear,” and Miri winced respectfully and wrote REVERENCE OR FEAR upside down on a scrap so she could reuse it in a headline without remembering she’d stolen it.

The Prime Arbiter sent for her before she could try the key on the nearest lamppost with a collar old enough to sigh. Soot escorted her through the traffic because an escort makes you look like you matter even when you’re thinking about eels and blue dye and the shape a missing ball makes in a case. They paused at the base of the Arch where proclamations went to be pecked, and a new sheet had been posted in a hand she recognized as the Prime Arbiter’s only because it refused to lean on its important letters. It said: TEMPORARY MEASURE REPEALED: MUFFLING OF DRUM PRACTICE TO RESUME; REGISTRATION OF ROLLED OBJECTS POSTPONED; CURFEW IN HUMAN QUARTER TO BE RECONSIDERED. The bottom was signed in that distant, careful hand, and when Inez looked up she found herself half smiling and half bracing for the Brigadier’s voice, which came soon after like a band marching up a narrow street and deciding the street must widen.

“Countermanded?” he demanded at no one in particular and everyone generally, because that is the default audience of a furious man who believes he loves the city more than those who live in it. “Countermanded by who. What is the point of a net if it is made of thread pulled from a hem?”

“You said yourself last night that sharing makes us look civilized,” Inez said as if to herself and as if she had not been listening to his arguments so long she could do impressions in private, and Soot snorted through his nose in a way that may have been agreement or the sudden recollection of an excellent lemon.

The Prime Arbiter waited for them in the Amber Room with his hands in his pockets like a schoolboy trying not to rattle the confiscated stone in his fist. Needle was there with a sheaf of something that had been paper but now looked like consequence, and the Minister of Sound leaned in the corner humming a scale that had always wished it were a ladder. Brigadier Plume arrived last because he enjoyed being seen arriving last, and when his shoulder plates kissed the doorframe from habit, they made a sound like a small bell being asked to be a large one.

“We will do this in the open,” the Prime Arbiter said, and he was not talking about his pockets. “We will not lie about the Rag. We will not lie about the drums. We will not pretend an empty terrarium is full because we do not want to learn empty’s grammar. Vale, you will announce the petitions at noon. You will tell the City we will hear what it has to say. Brigadier, you will post your men where their eyes are, not where their boots want to be. Needle, you will speak to the lampposts and discover whether iron can be bribed.”

“Already attempted,” Needle murmured, popping one of his needles out and back the way some men crack knuckles to think. “Iron replies in two moods: ‘no’ and ‘it depends who asks.’ I prefer this kind of honesty to the other kind our colleagues trade in.”

Inez found that her mouth had queued up a word without consulting her humility. “Sanctuary,” she said, and it came out with enough clarity to make everyone in the room look at her instead of their own tasks. “We should name a sanctuary today. During petitions. A room, a square, a bridge span. Somewhere anyone can stand and say what they must and not be collected into a net on the way home. It doesn’t have to last. It has to exist and have a boundary that is understood by people and gulls.”

The Prime Arbiter closed his eyes for the two beats it took to decide whether this would be the first mistake or the first act of a better meaning. Brigadier Plume looked like a man who had been challenged to hold a knife by the blade and smile about it. Needle did the quiet-kind calculation that happened behind his teeth, and the Minister of Sound, who believed geography was a melody with fewer notes, said softly, “The Echo Square by the stadium has lines everyone already knows. It’s where you go to see if an idea has legs. We could make it more than trick acoustics.”

“Echo Square,” the Prime Arbiter said, nodding as if the name was a lever that could be moved without breaking. “Echo Square will be sanctuary during petitions. If a guard arrests anyone within the chalk lines today, I will arrest the guard tomorrow. Brigadier, if this makes you itch, acquire a remedy that is not a baton.”

“I would prefer to be told to stay home and peel oranges,” Brigadier Plume said, with contempt so finely milled you almost wanted to buy some. “But I am obeying your mood because the Rag worked and we did not die.”

“We did not die,” Needle echoed pleasantly. “Our standards are improving.”

They gave her a bell that had belonged to a long-dead clerk whose great achievement had been the invention of a drawer for maps that kept them from sulking. It was less a bell than a suggestion horn disguised as a handbell, and its sound could be ignored politely by the rude and rudely by the polite. They gave her a leaf of thick paper to write the petition order on and a stick of blue chalk to mark the sanctuary’s edges, and they gave her the sort of permission that could retract itself without making a pop, which made her want to use it before the air changed.

She walked out under the parliament trees with Soot at her flank and Miri catching up with a satchel that made honest noises. The gulls were concerned about everything in a general way, and a child with a hoop realized that today hoops moved differently under the gaze of uniforms and changed the game so that the hoop was a cloud and nobody owned it. Inez took the blue chalk and drew the sanctuary with her hand making the same shape it made when she wanted to write a word that only existed when she needed it. The Echo Square’s cobbles took the chalk as if they had been waiting for permission to be more themselves, and when she finished, a breeze ranked itself around the four edges with the respect of a dog waiting to be told to go.

“The petitions,” she called, using the bell like punctuation more than announcement, and the square filled not in a rush but in a series of arrivals that suggested a plan and impatient improvisation had decided to date. There were rope-makers and knife-grinders and a woman who sold bells to people who didn’t think they needed them and were always wrong, and there were three ministers in plain clothes not fooling anyone and two boys with loquat peels under their nails and six men with shoulders like doors. The Prime Arbiter stood at the edge of the chalk and made an example of obeying his own line, and Brigadier Plume stationed his guards two paces back from the border so that anyone attempting to call him a liar would have to do so in a way that could ruin a boot.

The first petition was practical and beautiful without trying: a request to move rain barrels out from under the eaves at the school because the falling water had learned the children’s humming and was interfering with arithmetic. The second was incendiary only in letters: repeal the rope fence, all of it, or make the rope out of flowers so it will admit to what it is. The third was a poem disguised as a demand; the fourth was a demand disguised as a joke; the fifth had to do with taxes and the right to be boring and the way boredom had become a luxury. Inez wrote them down with Kettle hissing agreeably, and every time she wrote the letter R she thought of the Rag and of lamp posts and of the rule about lamp posts that might be a trap and a rescue at once.

Halfway through the hour, a woman at the back whispered in the direction of a uniform that her brother had been taken for looking like a rumor, and the uniform, to his own surprise, did not step forward, because he had been told the chalk was real and today he believed it. Miri slipped between petitioners doing the job the free paper refused to admit it did, and Soot made himself so useful at handing people cups of water that three different grandmothers tried to marry him to their daughters with their eyes. The Minister of Sound stood within the line, not outside it, and hummed under a man’s complaint until the complaint took on a tune and became easier to hear, and the man laughed and said, “Fine, sing my hunger,” and the Minister said, “I can’t sing what I haven’t tasted,” and a paper cone of almonds found its way to his hand from some invisible arrangement.

It would have been a good day if it had ended there, and for a stretch of minutes Inez let herself rehearse a version of ending which had her putting Kettle away and drinkingly remarking to Miri that sometimes governments can be surprised into being the thing they pretend. Then the lamppost at the southwest corner of Echo Square coughed, which is not a thing iron ought to do unless it is being asked a question it knows the answer to and hates. A boy in a cap the size of a fruit bowl leaned on the base and cried out because something inside had moved against his calf like a fish in a barrel, and three people stepped forward with the speed of curiosity perfected by practice and lifted the collar.

There, in the cavity where bribes and eels and lost notes go to consider their options, was a looped something wrapped in rag, and the rag had blue on it and the blue had grit and the grit smelled of pepper. Inez had the key out before anyone asked how devotees of rules become mechanics, and when she turned it the way Miri had taught her, the collar gave like someone consenting to a kiss and the rag bundle came free. It was heavier than it should have been considering the size, and when she put it on the cobble she felt the small interior chink that had worried her during the Rag’s perfect imperfection.

She unwrapped it because that is what you do when the day hands you a bundle in public and names you a special passer. Inside were three brass stars like the one Needle had found and the rivets that had held them and a threaded strip of leather that could have been an eyelid if you were a poet with a cruel streak. There was also a slip of vellum no bigger than a fish scale, and the ink on it was the gray-brown of old ambition; it said, in a hand that even dead would never apologize: Article Seven: On Substitution and the Stewardship of Silence.

The square breathed in and did not breathe out for a count of five. The Prime Arbiter did not move and did not have to; his stayingness transmitted through the chalk. Brigadier Plume took a step and wished he had not, because the line looked at him like a word you cannot pronounce without declaring allegiance. Needle, who had arrived as if he had been standing behind everyone this whole time and only just decided to declare himself, folded his hands in such a way that you could almost see the glove he wished he wore to keep fingerprints off meaning.

“Someone is molting a symbol,” Miri said quietly, which was the best description because it sounded like a bird doing something honest and alarming at once. “They’re leaving feathers where the city will find them, which is crime and art and love and war.”

“Article Seven,” Inez said, and the vellum flinched like a cat that has finally been named and would prefer to be anonymous. “It’s the clause we used last night. It exists in more than one copy. It exists in shavings.”

“Or it never existed,” Needle murmured, not to deny but to complicate, because that was his job and his soul. “Or someone is writing the law into our pockets so when we turn out our pockets we find ourselves culpable and beloved.”

Soot’s mouth had tightened into the kind of line that wanted to be a word but would not tell her which one until he could climb a lamppost and whisper to iron. He brushed the blue on his arm against the rag and made a small spectrum of regret. “This is Pel’s idea of humor,” he said without relish. “He wants us to chase the Football and find the skin, to discover that what we’ve been worshiping is a sewing project with a fractured conscience. He wants us to keep moving so speed feels like progress and grief feels like a trick we can undo.”

“Is he wrong,” Inez asked, and Soot gave her a look that was mostly eyebrows and some burned wrist and a little love. “No,” he said. “He is not wrong and he is not right and this is why I did not let him have my bone marrow.”

The petitions went on not because the bundle had been forgettable but because people are greedy for their own lives and for the lives of those they love, and the moment you promise a hearing you cannot make hunger wait while you file Article Seven. A woman with rings on all ten fingers asked for the right to name her new daughter “Branch” and be taken seriously by anyone who had ever seen a forest. A boy of twelve asked for the football field to be open on Tuesdays for orphan games and promised to keep score with fairness whether he liked the winners or not. A monkey with fur the color of a cloud before a storm offered six jars of honey to any minister who would try saying sorry twice in public and not die of it. Inez took their words down like prescriptions for a body she loved and did not trust, and the brass stars in the rag bundle weighed the edge of her skirt and made her walk as if she had remembered the pull of the river.

After, when the chalk line was just chalk again and the Brigadier had managed to make half his men look as if they were enjoying self-restraint, Inez brought the rag bundle to the Amber Room because there are some places a day goes to get written into other days. The Prime Arbiter set the stars on the table in a line as if counting them would undo their fall, and Needle held the vellum between two fingers like an apology he intended to make at the right time. Brigadier Plume paced, which he did with a precision that would have collapsed any wooden floor but had no effect on stone, and the Minister of Sound plucked the air as if it were a string instrument that had been tuned by an enemy and needed coaxing.

“Letter by letter, they are making us read our own story,” the Prime Arbiter said, not glad and not crushed, which is the posture of a man who intends to survive thinking. “If the Football is a skin sewn around a rumor and a rule, they are peeling it where we can watch. If we pretend not to see, the City will not forgive us for wearing a blindfold after we chose spectacles.”

“We could stitch the stars back on,” Brigadier Plume said, and there was a boy in his voice who wanted to fix a breakage with glue and not ask why gravity had reached for that particular thing. “We could stage a return. The public loves a miracle; the public loves a hero who confesses he is human; the public loves a ball. Our enemies love it when we chose the wrong love.”

“We could,” Needle agreed pleasantly, not agreeing at all. “We could also set the stars on the bridge rail and let the river have a say. Or hammer them into the Rag and call it an evolution and see who explodes first, the ministers who love precedent or the children who love play.”

“No,” the Prime Arbiter said, and the no was soft and final like a curtain dropping at the end of a scene that had refused to end for three minutes too long. “We will not counterfeit restoration. We will not pretend we are not being taught. Vale, you will take Article Seven to the Archive of Ordinary. It is a room nobody uses because calling a thing ordinary is a way to put it in a drawer and forget it. They will accept the vellum and they will pretend to sigh, and tomorrow we will send an apprentice to request a copy and see whether rooms can be made to tell the truth.”

“The Archive of Ordinary,” Inez repeated, tasting the dust of it on the back of her tongue, and the key in her pocket warmed itself as if memory had breath. “Does it have collars,” she asked, because humor kept the room from cracking, and the Prime Arbiter almost smiled in a way that made her forgive him again for being someone she could believe in at her own risk.

The Archive of Ordinary lived in a building you only noticed when you needed a coat you could be rained on in without grief. It sat between the Registry of Borrowed Names and the Office for Unpaid Gests, and its door had been painted the yellow of the first page in a cheap notebook, the color that reminds you of beginning in such a way that you understand why some poets set fire to their drafts. Inside there were cabinets, and inside the cabinets, papers, and inside the papers, laws and minutes and lists of quantities of rope and the apportionment of figs and trombones for Harvest Parades past. A woman behind a counter wore a cardigan the color of grilled sugar and had a face like a ledger that had learned to smirk. She took the vellum without blinking, stamped a receipt on thin pink stock that smelled faintly of lemon, and slid it to Inez with two fingers that had ink in the whorls like cartographers who had bitten their own thumbs.

“You’ll want to ask for a lookup on Article Seven in two hours,” the woman said, not exactly whispering, because whispering admits to conspiracy and she had been trained to accept coincidence instead. “If the copy is present and identical, everything is fine. If the copy is present and not identical, everything is interesting. If there is no copy, everything is either worse or better. That is my professional opinion and also the caution they taught us to issue to those with special cards.”

“I don’t have a special card,” Inez said, honest and lying at once because Needle’s card said YOU MAY PASS: SPECIAL and she hated it a little less now that it had helped her draw a chalk square with no blood in it. The woman considered the fact of her with the entertainment of a clerk who liked people for trying and went back to her cardigan and her stamps and the practical salvation of stapling.

On the walk back, Soot chose to be a companion and not a shadow, which made her feel both safer and watched. He had the look of a person who had decided to be told a story by the day rather than tell it himself, and that made her alert for Pel the way you get alert for an old song you don’t want to hear in a shop that sells radios to people who prefer drums. They cut through the market of damp things where mushrooms that had never seen sun told fortunes to people who liked to be lied to by flesh, and a woman selling salt had arranged her blocks in a pyramid that made the guards uncomfortable without understanding why geometry still had the power to disoblige men who owned boots.

“What’s the word,” Soot asked suddenly, and she would have pretended not to know what he meant if the inside of her mouth hadn’t already shaped it like a vowel that refused to stay under her tongue. “Sanctuary,” she said again, quieter, because a word loses potency if you leave it on the street too long without supervision, and Soot nodded and then shook his head and then did a third thing that was not head, as if his neck had invented a vote for nuance.

“Keep it for one more day and then trade it in,” he advised. “Words spoil if you refuse to spend them. You have ‘asylum’ in your pocket for later and ‘truce’ for a day that doesn’t pretend not to be an hour. ‘Amnesty’ is a pear; you need a knife and also a napkin.”

“Which are you carrying,” she asked, more to be kind than to be clever, and he grinned and patted his chest and said, “I have ‘flee’ sewn into my lining and ‘stay’ tattooed under it in lemon juice. If you heat me up I make sense.”

They reached the parliament trees at the precise minute the light learns to be late in a way that makes men with lists adjust their ties and women with carts lean their shoulders into the next thing. The Brigadier’s men were stacking their restraint on the edge of the square like firewood they might need, and the Prime Arbiter was in conversation with a monk who wore his fish-eating on his sleeve. Needle had acquired a new stain on his cuff that looked like truth trying to disguise itself as soup, and Miri, who had pretended to be too busy to care, stood with a paper folded under her arm that said, above a recipe for beans: WHAT YOU CALL A RAG MAY BE A FLAG IF YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN.

Soot hopped up into the low branches of a plane tree and began to tell the lesser monkeys a fairy tale about a kingdom that believed its crown could not be stolen because it had been welded to the king’s head, and while he spoke he flicked his ear in a way that told Inez he was listening to the ground as much as his own story. She took Kettle out, rolled a fresh sheet into position, and wrote SANCTUARY DECLARED: ECHO SQUARE, noon to dusk, by request of Prime Arbiter, in a hand that feared and loved seeing itself on paper. She wrote MEMO: lamp collars, key in pocket of Vale, test oldest posts by the fruit stalls because fruit hears things quickest. She wrote WORDS DUE: asylum, amnesty, truce, and put a dot by truce because it had come with a picture of the Brigadier’s face strangely calm.

Two hours later she went back to the Archive of Ordinary and asked for the copy. The woman in the cardigan went still the way a cat goes still when it sees a bug it likes but would rather the bug confess. She opened a drawer, pulled out a folder labeled MISPLACED, then another labeled FOUND WHILE DUSTING, and finally a third labeled DO NOT LABEL. She produced a sheet of vellum that had the right smell and the wrong handwriting, a hand more florid, less certain, and at the bottom there was a smear that might have been lemon, and the clause read: If the Sphere be mislaid, stolen, eaten by dog, or otherwise under providence absent, a Substitute may be named by witnesses unaligned, whose number shall not be less than seven nor more than twelve, save in cases of fog, in which case decisions may be deferred to lamplighters, birds, or the river if present.

The river if present, Inez thought, and felt the brass star bruise under her pillow replicate itself in the side of her skull. She thanked the woman for the entertainment because clerks have to become a little in love with the small shows they put on, and she walked out with a copy she had not known she needed, and the day lifted one corner of its rug to reveal marbles that had rolled under and been waiting to rejoin the game.

At dusk she stood in the Amber Room again with the Prime Arbiter, the Brigadier, Needle, the Minister of Sound, and a silence that wasn’t muffled this time but respectful. She set the copy on the table and put the rag bundle beside it, and she told them that the river had been written into the law without anyone asking it whether it consented, and the Brigadier looked at the ceiling as if hunting for a god to blame for metaphor. Needle traced the line about fog with one needle and said, “Nothing is as dangerous as a rule that tries to be poetic,” and the Prime Arbiter touched the words ‘lamplighters’ and ‘birds’ in turn and said, “It is sometimes our good fortune to be ruled by those who knew they were silly and ambitious.”

Miri knocked once and entered without waiting, because the free paper had taught her to treat doors like ideas that needed testing. She carried a broadside hot from the press that said in letters big enough for a gull: THE RIVER IS PRESENT, which was not a headline so much as a dare disguised as adequacy. Soot slipped in after her and put a walnut on the table among the brass stars like a joke no one would get until tomorrow, and the Minister of Sound, who had grown up on a ferry and believed water kept secrets with better taste than most people, smiled into his sleeve like a boy.

They did not plan a trap because they were outnumbered by the city’s ability to plan its own, and they did not plan a parade because parades attract whoever wants to be seen and they needed those who preferred to be felt. They planned the thing you plan when you know you are going to be told a story whether you like it or not: they planned to stand where it could be told and to decide afterward what they had heard. At midnight the drums would be muffled again if the mufflers could be found, and if they could not, the river would learn a second name for itself, and if the Football rolled anywhere by accident or design, the city had been prepared by its own gossip to make use of whatever circle it could find.

Inez went home with a key in her pocket and two versions of Article Seven in her satchel and blue still on her thumb from the locker room wall. She put Kettle under the bed because some nights you make writing wait with the dust, and she set the brass star on the windowsill where the moon could teach it about being misinterpreted. Sleep came like a clerk with a complicated index, flipping through her head to find the page that could bear the weight of being the last thought, and just before she went under she heard Soot’s voice from the lamppost outside, telling the end of the fairy tale about the crown welded to a skull, which ended not with a revolution or a marriage but with the discovery that the weld was a seam and the seam could be unpicked by a baker with strong fingers and a taste for lemons.

In the morning, she would go to the oldest lamppost by the fruit stalls and use the strike key and find either an eel or a note or nothing, and whichever it was would be enough to push the day into its next shape. In the morning, the Prime Arbiter would ask her to say a word into a room full of amber and hunger and ears, and she would choose truce and regret it and prefer it and learn to hold three feelings in her mouth without biting her tongue. In the morning, the Rag would still be round enough, and the terrarium would have added a new crescent of mud mixed with sky, and the river would come to the city like a guest and a judge, and she would stand with her hands open and keep count.Chapter 7

By the time the bakery made its second sound of the morning, the deep scooped sigh that meant loaves were coming out with their backs lacquered, Inez had taught herself not to reach for the brass star on the sill as if it were the handle to the day. She put water in her hair with both hands until it reconsidered being a warning and agreed to be a crown, and she slid the strike key into the seam of her skirt where it would tickle when she forgot it and remind her to remember. The city’s light came in with flour dust, which is to say with purpose and a desire not to be remarked on more than bread deserved. Down on Rope Lane a man with a pallet of oranges had already lost one, and it rolled to a curb and leaned there like a tired prophet. She kissed Kettle’s lid without meaning it romantically, then meant it, because there are only so many machines in a life that will hiss for you on command.

The oldest lamppost by the fruit stalls had ivy at its base that changed its mind at every season and a tilt it had earned from watching more parades than were healthy for a spine. The collar showed its age in a ring of rust the precise color of old apricots, and someone had scratched initials into the iron in a careful, timid hand that suggested a child had loved a lamppost once for its proximity to danger. She crouched and the strike key found its slot the way a word finds its root if you say it in an accent you didn’t know you had. The key turned with the quiet resistance of someone being convinced, and when the collar released the city exhaled through the seam. Inside, caught in a web of old paper and spider logic, lay a small tin cylinder stoppered with a cork the color of the river on a cloudy day. Alongside it, flattened and dry but still entirely eel, was the eel, a ribbon of remembered wet with a bead of blue on its skull that could have been a mistake or a signature or a kiss.

She took the cylinder, because paper can mold itself into omen when you let it, and left the eel where it was because not all metaphors need unrolling before breakfast. The cork fought as if it had been told that resignation would be undignified, came free with a sound like someone not quite stifling a laugh, and revealed a twist of vellum that had taken on the smell of tin and old salt. The writing leaned forward on the line like a runner at a rope in wind. It said: If you can get them to say it in the open, the river will hold it for an hour without dropping it. Bring the Rag to the waterline at evening when the ferry horn feels like grief. Do not let the Brigadier call it a drill. Say truce. The lamplighters will stand. —L.

L for lamplighter or for a woman whose name had laces in it or for a lie that was attempting to be kind. The letter had a smudge at the top where a thumb had pressed, and the smudge had blue in it like the city had begun to stain itself to match its schemes. She put the vellum under the belt of her blouse where heat would compel it to be true and wrapped the collar again with the efficiency of someone who valued hiding places, then stood to find Soot already above her, upside down on a crossbar with his face the right way up as if to demonstrate to gravity that obedience is a skill, not a character trait.

“Tell me it was an eel,” he said, and she said, “It was also a letter,” and he brightened as if both possibilities had been willing to share him. He dropped lightly and walked backward three steps so his eyes could stay on the tree of lampposts he loved as if they were cousins. “The lamplighters will stand,” he repeated, tasting the capital L like sugar that did not belong to him. “That makes them a line of witnesses by design and obstinacy. I have never trusted a guild that refuses to advertise itself and also refuses to disappear. It means they see better than I do and I am forced to love them for it.”

“You’re forcing yourself to love a lot of things this week,” she said, because affection can be generous and still sting, and he bowed and then shrugged like a man who has been counted correctly and prefers it to being praised.

She found Miri by the free paper with her sleeves rolled and her eyebrows arranged in the useful position between alarm and déjà vu. When Inez put the letter on the counter Miri did not touch it first; she smelled it, announced that the tin had been used to hold cough lozenges before it lost its first life, and then snapped it flat with two thumbs like a pigeoneer remembering a good fold. “Say truce,” she read, upside down and delighted by the way language will behave even when your eyes are impolite. “He wants you to say truce, or she does, or the world. You were going to say it anyway. That’s like a conspiracy recruiting you into your own plans.”

“I was going to say it into a room,” Inez replied, wondering whether ambition always felt like this, like a thing with a rind you could break only if you didn’t look at your hands. “Now I have to say it into air, and air has opinions.”

Miri leaned on the counter until it made a creak that sounded like a confession. “Air likes a word with a hard consonant to chew on and a soft interior to keep,” she said. “Truce will ride, if you let it. Don’t let the Brigadier name it ceasefire, which tastes like paper and boots. If the lamplighters stand, I’ll print their names and get half of them fired in exchange for getting the right half famous.”

“Leave their names with the river,” Inez said, and Miri’s eyebrows agreed to postpone fame out of respect for functioning lamps.

The Prime Arbiter had developed the efficient habit of standing where light made him look least trustworthy, as if to dare people to decide to believe him anyway. He met her in the Amber Room because the day was insisting on that specific thirst, and he held the letter with careful fingers as if it were the kind of fragile that did not appreciate being told so. The Brigadier read it with his mouth, which is to say he curled his upper lip around the idea of being instructed by a guild, and Needle read it with his breath, which is to say out and in and out again as if the ink might climb the air and tell him more in another register. The Minister of Sound did a thing which was not helpful and still helped, which was hum the first two notes of a lullaby that had the word truce hidden in a line about cows and starlight.

“We say it,” the Prime Arbiter decided in the tone of a man who knows there are only so many ways to say no to the river and remain its neighbor. “We say it where it can hear us and we mean it for an hour and we regret it when the hour ends and ask for more when our regret becomes unbearable. Brigadier, you will not call it a drill. You will not call it a test. You will call it a hearing and you will stand like a man being spoken to by the only thing in the city that does not have to explain itself to us.”

“I have always liked boats,” Brigadier Plume said with alarming sincerity that he hid under his next scowl. “They obey ropes when they are well-rigged. They obey the river when they are not. If the river is to be a witness, I will have no one throwing their voices into it so it answers to ventriloquists.”

“Your insistence on opposing puppetry is admirable and only slightly applicable,” Needle murmured, eyes on the vellum as if it might flip itself and reveal a second letter on its back. “I will speak to the lamplighters and see whether they prefer their collars opened by keys or by kleptomania. Vale, you will keep your word in your mouth until it softens.”

“I will say truce,” Inez replied because there are moments when your tongue understands what your spine can bear, and she walked out with the letter’s chalky smell on her hands and the awareness of counting settling around her neck like a scarf she had not meant to wear in summer.

The terrarium had behaved itself overnight by gathering more condensation than seemed decent. On the glass, near the seam, a crescent of mud had acquired partners, smaller moons of grit with veins of blue as if someone had rubbed sky on soil with a forefinger and left the day there by mistake. Inside, down at the curve where glass becomes a truth about curves, the sliver of vellum she had thought she saw before had widened into an edge. If the Football’s rules were still inside, they had begun to fray in a language paper uses when paper is tired of being folded and wants to be read. She put her palm to the glass and the glass did what glass does, which is nothing explicable that still manages to feel like an answer. She had the unpleasant wish to see it broken and the more unpleasant wish to be innocent of the wish, and because both were a kind of sin she breathed until they got bored and went to bother a less honest woman.

Noon at Echo Square drew its chalk lines without her hand this time, which made her feel both freed and unnecessary. Miri had arrived with folded broadsides and unfolded opinions, the ferry captain Two-Tides had the intelligence to stand where the wind would bring him the first scent of argument, and the monk who ate fish had brought along a small child who ate the edges of paper when nobody stopped her and was therefore a more extreme case of the Prime Arbiter. The Brigadier’s men stood back two paces from the line without being told because Soot had told them last night in the democracy of stories, and the Minister of Sound did not hum because the square was already tuned. Inez stepped onto a flat stone that had a scar the shape of the letter O and held the bell like a prop she was happy to own and said the word into the air as if it were a thing that needed catching.

“Truce,” she said, and it went out of her mouth in a shape she recognized and did not. It went into ears that refused to commit to certainty and into eyes that agreed to represent it fairly and into the spaces above shoulders that looked like ledgers before payday. The word made a small pause in frames of anger and knit itself into hems of patience without asking for thread. She regretted it as it left her the way you regret bread the second it is in the oven because you cannot season it anymore, and then she preferred it because the smell that returned to her was not of surrender but of hands that had put something down without losing it.

The petitions were quicksilver when held and turned back into breath when you let go. A woman asked for the rope fences to be replaced with pergolas that vines would eat; a boy confessed to a mischief he had enjoyed and asked for its codification as a seasonal festival; a man suggested that lamp posts be given names like dogs so that listening to iron could be more personal; a monkey argued that all uniforms have pockets large enough to accommodate a loaf as an act of restraint and charity; a child demanded an apology for the day they had banned balls and for three days thereafter as interest. Inez wrote them into Kettle’s ration with a care that made her fingers shake and her distrust of lists warm itself at last. Miri distributed papers with recipes for beans disguised as odes to the River, capitalization change not accidental, and the Brigadier said nothing aloud that could be printed and therefore left fewer teeth marks on the afternoon than usual.

In the lull that pretends to be a recess and is in fact a breath being hoarded, Needle came to her with a smell of lamp oil and a crease on his sleeve that announced he had leaned his arm against an ellipsis. “The lamplighters will stand,” he reported without introduction, which had become a kindness, not a habit. “They will bring their long-hooks and wear their coats and not their old hats. They are shy about hats. They will not use their keys unless a collar refuses to admit it is a collar. They will accept no pay and expect stories. We can afford them.”

“What do they want a story about,” she asked, because currency is easier when you have a list of denominations, and he smiled the way a man smiles when his knives are jealous of his patience. “Lamplighters only accept stories about light,” he said. “Tell them one about the time you mistook a reflection for a door, and you will be permitted to pass.”

They went to the river together before dusk because sometimes a ceremony requires reconnaissance and sometimes a river demands visitation. The river had the look of a person resting one hand against a wall for balance while pretending to inspect the wall. Barges moved like nouns that refused to decline; little boats grew beards of weed and unspecific guilt; the gulls had cheated on their lineup and were trying to argue their way back into rank; people leaned where they had always leaned and told each other the latest attributed to the lamplighters as if that guild had any interest in becoming the subject of fresh myths. The lampposts along the promenade stood in the attitude of men in the second verse of a song they haven’t yet decided to hate, and when the lamplighters came they came like punctuation, long hooks slanting, coats smelling faintly of oil, faces all one family and no two resembling. A woman older than the river when it rained took Inez’s striking key from her pocket with a politeness that made it obvious she had put it there in the first place, and she bent her head toward Inez’s shoulder as if to examine the taste the day had left on it.

“Say it into an open hand,” the lamplighter advised, not whispering because secrecy was not her magic. “Words remember the shape they are made in. Then throw it to the river and do not ask it to bring it back neatly. Water is not your clerk.”

“I am my own clerk,” Inez said with a small, inadvertent pride, and the woman laughed once and put her hand on a lamppost in greeting the way you rest your palm on a horse’s side to remind it that it is not alone.

At the hour when the ferry horn learns it is sadness being blown through brass which refuses to apologize for being an instrument, people who did not intend to be a congregation became one. The Prime Arbiter came without his coat and with his cuffs rolled, a man prepared to be splashed and a legal argument simultaneously. Brigadier Plume arrived so crisp he might as well have been starched with self-rebuke, and his men stood like small versions of him and tried to see whether water had teeth. The Minister of Sound brought his discretion and a whistle and did not intend to use either. Miri had a pencil behind her ear and red ink in her pocket by mistake and declared the mistake a policy. Two-Tides wore his hat as if a bird had loaned it to him and had warned him not to ruin it. The monk who loved fish held back near the chalk that had been drawn as a symbolic courtesy onto stone that was damp and likely to rebel from all chalk and still held the line. Quin the stadium sweeper had his broom because men in love with the edges of their work bring it everywhere, and Poppy with her willingness to test the weight of a witness stood in shoes that did not agree with water and refused to care. Soot found a lamp that liked him better than its neighbors and settled on it, and if his tail was a sentence beginning somewhere else and arriving in his lap, nobody was impolite enough to say.

They did not set the Rag on the water because the Rag had not been built for drowning. They held it level like a table for offerings and a traveling stage and the memory of a ball that had consented to substitute. Miri’s stitching held, because Miri stitched like a woman correcting a lie, and the buttons inside shifted with small metallic suggestions that would have bothered a more fearful ceremony. Inez stood with her hands open, palms turned up because someone had told her to make an open hand and she admired the purity of following instructions, and when the ferry horn admitted to being grief she said it, and her mouth had already prepared itself to be honest.

“Truce,” she told the river, and the river behaved as if it had heard its name pronounced correctly by a foreigner, which is to say it softened around the syllables, lengthened them, tried them on its bed for fit, and then held. The lamplighters lifted their hooks in a gesture that had been greeting, warning, and wedding in years that did not remember each other, and the lampposts hummed lightly because iron nursed resonance when asked politely. The Brigadier breathed in and made himself breathe out; the Prime Arbiter looked as if he had just told a truth he had wanted to keep longer; the Minister of Sound’s whistle made no sound because his mouth had decided not to command; Needle counted lamp collars and birds with a small, fast mathematics; Miri wrote a sentence in her head she would pretend to have found later in an envelope addressed to no one.

For an hour—because someone had promised this much and the river is a god of contracts as well as chaos—they made no arrests and made no speeches, and the city developed a new habit of not crossing a line and not hating the line because it was told its temporariness aloud. Children kicked rag balls between ankles that did not sidestep in panic and discovered that pleasure does not require rebellion, merely room. A man and a woman who had not spoken for six months stood at the same rail as if brought there by the same gull and found themselves mesting, which is the particular verb describing the moment when two stubborn cheeks realize they have been facing in the same direction the entire time. The lamplighters watched the water for words and consented to understand gestures instead. Soot whistled once and swallowed something that was not a nut.

The river made its answer without language as we understand it. A scrap of leather came up against the quay where children had always put their hands so their wrists could taste the scale of what goes by. It had three holes in it where stars had been, and one of those holes had a thread in it, and on the thread, in the knot, there was grit the color of the bridge’s tar and the flavor of pepper. Two-Tides scooped it with a net he kept under his hat for men who refused to believe in luck and passed it along without exhibition. Quin set it on the Rag and for a moment everyone pretended the Rag was a mouth and the scrap a word and that this constituted a grammar. The lamplighters nodded as if it had been an answer to a question no one asked in the first place because no one ever does, and the Prime Arbiter put two fingers on the leather and then wiped them on his trousers in a very human movement that made three uniforms soften around their elbows.

“It is shedding,” Miri said very softly, because sometimes a ceremony does not want to be told what it is doing and will only forgive you if you whisper, and Brigadier Plume allowed himself to look like a man who might cry if it could be useful and then refused because it would not be. The Rag took the scrap into its weight the way a body takes a scar: with a mixture of resignation and longing. Needle’s eyes went somewhere other than his face, which is his way of thinking, and when he returned them he met Inez’s and asked her a question without teeth. She nodded without word and the law that was a cloth held a new meaning without complaint, because cloth knows about addition.

The hour ended because all hours end; the river let the word go without dropping it because an hour is a thing water respects, and the lamplighters lowered their hooks with the courtesy you use when leaving a house, and the Brigadier announced nothing because to announce would be to make it smaller, and the Prime Arbiter made the smallest possible nod a city can accept as permission to begin breathing in public again. The crowd unmade itself with the relieved efficiency of people who had managed to be good at the same time and would now like to tell the story of it twice before the day spoiled. Soot’s lamppost felt taller under him as if iron enjoyed being useful. Miri’s pencil left a dent in her ear and the dent stayed for three hours in a demonstration of loyalty. Two-Tides went to count his ferry ropes and rediscover rain where he had not expected it, and the monk, who had cried without embarrassing anybody, carried the child home in the wrong direction on purpose so she would learn a new alley by mistake and make it a routine.

In the corridor after, Inez found that the Rag had gained another small chink in its tone, a gear tooth against fabric, the secret metal announcing itself as more than bones and less than betrayal. She pressed it with her palm through cloth and felt the answer press back in the rhythm of a clock that did not yet agree to be time. Needle waited until he was a polite distance from everyone’s hearts and then took the Rag from her as if it were a book he intended to lend and never would. He opened the seam with a seamstress’s patience and a thief’s skepticism and drew out a tiny mechanism in a tin canister not unlike the one the eel had used for housing and the lamplighters had used for secrets. Inside, under a lid engraved with a gull, lay a ring of paper the size of a child’s hand, and when he unwound it and set it out flat with four needles at the compass points, the diagram it declared could have been mistaken for a diagram of a flower or a map of a neighborhood or the plan of a bomb.

“It’s a chorus,” he said when Inez looked at him as if she had been waiting to be told how to name it. “It shows where the lampposts that will answer each other are and when they will answer. It shows which birds to throw seed to and which to ignore. It tells someone who already knows what it means when to stand on which bit of iron and how to whisper into the collar so the next lamppost sings. It is either a generous cheat sheet or a very polite threat.”

“Pel,” Soot said behind them, not as a question and not as an accusation, but as a noun that had chosen its fate. “He will hate this for being useful. He will pretend it is Romantic until it saves him and then he will not mention it again.”

“He will also not be the only contributor,” Needle answered, lifting one of the needles with which he had pinned the paper and making space in the world for humility. “A lamplighter made this. Or someone taught by one. Or someone who asked a lamplighter to betray a professional superstition and got lucky with a grandchild. Our city is becoming more talented at breaking its own secrecy without shattering its muscle. I am both alarmed and proud.”

Inez put a finger on the spot where Echo Square had been represented by a small loop that looked like a coin a child had swallowed and lived, and she traced along the line to the river, then up to the bridge with the initials and back to the Amber Room which had, in this rendering, a little skull drawn at the corner as if the person mapping it had wanted to flirt with melodrama. The tin box smelt of lemon, which had become the smell of her day and would not leave her cuffs alone. She folded the chorus back into its roll and gave it to Needle with the gravitas of someone handing away a word she did not trust herself to use without ruining.

“Do we say we found it,” she asked, and the Prime Arbiter, who had come up silent and acquired a smudge of water at the hem of his trousers and looked more like a person because of it, shook his head with a kind of generosity. “We say we heard it,” he said, and she hated him a little for being right and loved him enough to make the hatred a manageable weight, and Miri entered with ink on the side of her hand and a breathlessness you cannot buy, only empty yourself to make space for, and announced that the free paper would not print the chorus and would instead print a recipe for soup and a meditation on truce with notes toward its ruin.

Night curled its black edges under the doors of the ministries and made the lamps worth their oil, and the lamplighters did the old ballet with the new respect and allowed two children to follow them for six posts and then vanish under admonitions disguised as riddles. The drums in the vault had been recovered by a boy who had discovered he could make his life easier by telling the truth and who had nobody to hate that day; their mufflers smelled like hands and rain, which is to say of salvation and habit. Brigadier Plume released his men from standing high to standing low and was cheered by no one and pleased by that. Soot came down from whatever lamppost had understood him and ate walnuts until his blue was mostly memory, and he pressed his burned wrist to the window of the Amber Room when he thought no one was looking and stood there until the pulse in his scar matched the inside of the glass.

Inez walked home with the weight of absence on her shoulder as if the Football itself had chosen her as a perch and was willing to behave for a night if she were willing to stop inventing metaphors. She passed the schoolyard with its cut goalposts and saw a group of kids practicing for the first time going slow on purpose, which is harder than it looks and better than it sounds. She went by the rope fences that looked like hair that had forgotten to be braided and saw two men tie their anger into something you could climb without being torn, and she resolved to learn the knot in the morning even if she had to pretend to be late to do it.

In her room above the bakery, which had grown less hot only because her skin had agreed to remember what air feels like, she set the brass star next to the tin cylinder on the windowsill so they could teach each other patience by example. She put the copy of Article Seven with its river in her satchel and the original copy with its lamp posts and birds in the drawer where bread knives and love letters end up when you are bad at putting things away with dignity. Kettle went under the bed because novels about the day would be written tomorrow and today deserved to be a story that could live without the sound of keys. She lay down with her hands open, remembering solidly the shape they had made at the river, and she said truce again into the dark, because repetition is either weak magic or the best kind, and she listened to the city say it back to her in a dozen registers—the ferry horn, a spoon in a glass in a kitchen where a fight had been postponed, a lamplighter’s hook striking iron gently by mistake, a gull passing judgment and changing its mind, two bodies negotiating space under a thin blanket, a monkey laughing too loud and correcting himself, the Prime Arbiter saying please to a room that could not provide it and doing so anyway. In that distribution of sound she fell asleep, not safe and also yes, and the star and the tin kept watch like emblems from different currencies making a private exchange rate.

She woke once in the shallow middle of night because Kettle hissed for no reason, and she sat up quickly enough to hear the second sound, which was not the oven below remembering a fairy tale but the faintest rattle against the terrarium glass in her head. It wasn’t real because she was not in the Amber Room; it was real because the city had made itself perfectly audible, and she decided it was the vellum unscrolling itself one syllable under the blue, and she made a vow with no words in it to keep her hands still and wait to be told by the morning which one she would be asked to say.Chapter 9

The morning showed its teeth through a veil of steam, and the city kissed them and called it weather, and Inez woke with both hands already opening as if the river had taught her a habit that slept no more than a gull. The bakery below exhaled sugar and apology; the brass star kept its patient watch on the sill beside the cough-lozenge tin; the strike key pressed against her hip like a word that would not be ignored. She thought she heard, in that corridor between getting up and being up, the tiny creak of vellum moving against glass, but when she held herself still enough to permit scrutiny, the sound had already given its place to window hinges and carts, to the thick rain of flour on wooden counters, to Miri’s press harmonizing with the oven as if the city had tuned itself to friendly friction. She put on the blouse that had learned to smell like lemon and river and worry, and when she found Kettle’s ribbon had snagged on a thread, she picked it loose with her teeth and told the machine to forgive her for being jealous of other instruments.

Soot met her on the stair as if he had been waiting in the threshold of other people’s thresholds and chose hers out of courtesy. He had a new affection for gravity and showed it by walking down three steps and back up one, as if to prove allegiance could be negotiated. The blue at his knuckles had become a rumor of blue, a whisper at the edge of fur where sweat insists on memorializing mischief, but when he lifted his hand to knock on the banister in greeting, the stain flashed like a bruise that still knew its origin story. He presented her with a pear and a warning and pretended the order of offerings had not been a choice.

“They’re going to search the collars,” he said, and she did not ask who they were because men in uniforms and men in old coats and men who liked to pretend they were neither all wore a family resemblance when they got nostalgic about control. “Not all at once, and not with the official word for it. They’ll call it checking for corrosion and asking after eels. But it’s a sweep, and I like sweeps only when they end with confetti.”

“I have a key and a good expression,” Inez replied, and because he looked ready to be soothed by a joke, she added, “I also have an eel, if we need to throw someone a decoy that bites with rhetoric,” and he laughed with his shoulders because laughter had to live somewhere, and sometimes faces were already rented out.

The Archive of Ordinary sent a boy with hair slicked into the shape of obedience and shoes that squeaked secrets prematurely. He delivered a slip on card stock that smelled faintly of wax and a kitchen where onions had been made to cry for art; it said that a discrepancy had gone tidy overnight and would not apologize for having been interesting. When Inez went to the yellow door between Borrowed Names and Unpaid Gests, the cardigan clerk offered her coffee in a cup that remembered a wedding and a receipt for an absence, and the copy of Article Seven that had contained birds and the river was now the more sober edition she had delivered, as if humility had gone home and changed its shirt.

“We keep parallel shelves,” the clerk confessed in the tone of a woman telling you the recipe you asked for is missing flour on purpose. “The Ordinary has two sides. You can decide which to believe, and later you can decide again. We do not lock our doubles; that would be impolite to truth.”

Inez signed a ledger with a name she only recognized by its music and returned to the square with two laws in her head and the knowledge that one of them would always be referred to as the one with birds. Miri had turned her chalk cat into a hydra with seven agreeable heads that carried banners in its teeth reading LEG ROOM and LEFTOVERS and LET. The letters were a time-saving device; people came by and pointed at the ones they needed and left coins or words, and Miri took both and printed with whichever ink each paid best. The new broadside said IF THE LAW CAN SWIM and under it a recipe for soup a lamplighter had dictated in exchange for anonymity and a promise to spell her favorite herb correctly.

The Prime Arbiter had put on a suit that believed in forgiveness and could be washed. He summoned her to the Amber Room and stood with his hand on the frame of the window like a man who had been told he might be required to leave by the same door he entered and would prefer to be not entirely surprised when it happened. Brigadier Plume drank water as if it were an enemy in need of a fair fight, and Needle had acquired an ink stain shaped like a weasel attempting to be a shadow. The Minister of Sound was testing the stripes of light from the pane as if he could play them with a bow.

“They’ll search the collars,” Inez said without introduction, because the day had elected to be honest before coffee. “We should not let them humiliate iron for being hollow. Make it a courtesy house-call from the lamplighters. Let the guilds examine their own throats and declare themselves whole. If the Brigadier sends his thumbs to do it, we’ll be pulling needles out of velvet for weeks.”

“I do not have thumbs,” the Brigadier announced with offended dignity that might have been comedy if you had not seen what his hands could do. “I have ten measurable proofs that the world needs a grip.” He rubbed his wrist where a watch would have looked excellent if it had known how to keep time according to orders. “But yes. Let the lamplighters turn their own collars and tell us if the river has been whispering into them at night.”

Needle unfolded the map of the chorus on the table and pinned it with a knife this time instead of needles, which gave it the air of being more dangerous or more loved, depending on where you kept your fear. He traced the line that ran from Echo Square to the river and up over the bridge to the Amber Room, and then he tapped a series of posts along Rope Lane with one finger as if checking their pulse. “He’s building a trumpet,” he said, and if he meant Pel he did not allow the name the satisfaction of a syllable. “He’s planning to play the city to itself and make it cry or dance, I cannot tell which, possibly both. We can choose the tune, or we can pretend to be deaf and listen anyway. Minister. If I give you numbers, will you set them to air.”

The Minister of Sound had been waiting to be asked to do something that involved hands inside his throat. He took the paper and hummed nothing that Inez could hear and nodded, and the nod was rhythm and permission and a resignation to art. The Prime Arbiter looked at Inez as if she were a lamppost he could bribe with respect, and said, “Say asylum today. Say it in the square and into a collar and at the door of the Archive and into the river if you have to. Then spend it before it goes stale.”

Soot walked with her to the terrarium because he had the sudden ambition to be present at all the doors she opened and because he didn’t trust the glass not to learn impatience from the city. The case had collected a quarter-inch more of the kind of condensation that looked like a map of islands you couldn’t get to without a boat and a year, and at the bottom, where the curve did its smug believing in curves, a sliver of vellum had become a sound edge pretending it was still shy. A crescent of mud with blue gleam in it had dried into a signature. The latch knew what it had done and hung itself elegantly, not contrite, not proud. Inez put her palm on the pane and pressed hard enough to feel her pulse steady itself against something that had never bled, and she wished again to break it and again decided not to for reasons that were moral and practical and superstitious all at once.

“Needle has a glass-cutter,” Soot whispered, because he was a devil and a librarian equally. “He sharpens it on honesty. He would use it for you as long as you consented to be injured by it in the right places.”

“Not today,” she said, and the not was not yet a never, which is a form of hope that people without keys keep for themselves. She leaned close and blew on the seam as if breath owned right-of-way, and she thought she saw a shiver pass through the vellum like a fish under ice changing its mind about the direction of hunger.

They held petitions at noon within a line so familiar the chalk put itself down without visible labor. Inez said asylum into the air in a voice that had learned from truce how to be serious without being dreary, and the lamplighters took their hooks and turned their own collars with the tenderness of women braiding hair they planned to unbraid later for political reasons. A rope-maker asked for the right to tie bridges into ladders for festival days; a blacksmith wanted charcoal rations recalibrated to the amount of heat necessary for regret; a boy with butter on his lip asked why the ministers did not have to stand on one foot while voting, to see if they had practiced balance, and the Prime Arbiter, who had taken to standing near the edge of sanctuary for the pleasure of pretending he could be refused entry, said into the bell-distance, “We are making that a pilot program.”

Brigadier Plume posted men at the heads of alleys instead of at the mouth of the square, and the men got to feel secretly more useful because passersby apologized to them with their shoulders instead of with actual crimes. Miri ran two papers at once, the one with recipes and the one with confessions, the latter printed in ink that washed off with vinegar so her informants could wipe their names from their hands if asked. Needle stood near a lamppost and spoke into its collar about taking pleasure in useless labor and watched how the iron protested in a tone that meant consent had been negotiated yesterday by somebody more charming.

In the middle of a petition about the way rain chose favorites in the Ministry’s courtyard and why that was unjust to certain less-connected pots, a commotion oversized for its offense rolled in from Rope Lane: two boys with a basket of oranges they had not stolen and a woman with a goat that loved oranges but had not been allowed to eat one, and between them a marmoset with a testing look and a head full of oxygen. Soot let himself be the center long enough to absorb the possibility of being accused, then stepped out of the radius and offered the goat an orange because sometimes the best argument is citrus. The goat declined with dignity; it preferred peels.

“You’ll have to choose,” Miri said in Inez’s ear, meaning not fruit, and Inez had the unhelpful thought that choosing is sometimes agreeing to be eaten by the wrong animal. She wrote down a poem disguised as a complaint about the docks, intact with rhymes even in the parts the poet had not bothered to rhyme, and when the woman with the goat raised her voice to ask where exactly asylum was held when everyone already knew the line they were not supposed to cross, Inez rang the bell and said, “Here,” and the word went out and came back as if the echo had learned to argue, and she understood that she would have to say it to more than one piece of furniture before night.

Needle pulled her aside after and handed her a coin wrapped in cigarette paper. It weighed less than it should have, like currency that had been asked to purchase regret. “For lamplighters,” he said, and when she unwrapped it later she found not a coin but a small steel washer engraved with a gull, the same gull that had flown on the lid of the tin with the chorus inside. It was a pass, then, or a song key, and it made her pocket feel heavier because it asked her to tell the right story to the right iron at the right time. She realized with that pocket-weight the precise enormity of the city’s trick: it was making her into a lamplighter without conferring a coat.

In the hour between late afternoon and dusk—the hour when bakers slow and publicans begin to move with the rhythm of making things liquid—she went to the bridge with the initials and stood in the exact place where she had fed the velvet bag to happen, and she said asylum into the rope. The rope held her word the way rope holds everything, with a generosity tinged by the fact that it is also attached to something else. The river heard and made a noise like an agreement that will have to be renegotiated later, and the gulls are impossible to please when it comes to vocabulary and decided to disapprove until bribed with light. She put the washer in the collar of the nearest lamp the way a person slips a letter under a door certain someone will hear it land, and then she went home by way of the stadium because large empty bowls are comfort when you have been offered too many cups.

Quin was sweeping chalk that did not want to surrender its right to stay; Poppy was standing in the center of the field trying to decide whether a Rag could roll by willing it to; and up in the highest row where pigeons learn self-importance, a figure with a hat his mother did not buy him watched with the precise casualness that denoted Pel. He did not wave and did not leave, which was his kind of attention and also his apology. Miri, who had followed because she had developed the habit of being present where nouns had to perform verbs, nudged Inez with an elbow sharper than some knives and said, “If you talk to him now, he’ll give himself a speech and use up all his good lines. If you wait, he’ll be forced to be practical.”

“I am not here to talk,” Inez said, and it was true enough that even Miri accepted it and reserved her skepticism for dessert. She went to the sideline and put her hand on the paint where the officiants stood and said asylum into the grass, and the grass pretended to be unimpressed and kept the word at its roots. It was the kind of ritual that did not belong to the ministers or the river or the lamplighters and therefore was the only kind that could be trusted to do its work without a meeting.

Night arrived with the reasonable intention of being night and found itself recruited into ceremony. The lamplighters assembled in a line along the promenade and in their less public duties along Rope Lane and the fruit stalls and outside the Archive of Ordinary and in a spot thirty paces from the Amber Room where iron ran old and stronger. They carried their hooks as if they were polite weapons and greeted their posts by name: Gretel and Smudge and Old Knee and Cutwater and The Lying One. The Minister of Sound set his chorus into the air with a humility that made Inez think of how a bell permits itself to be a hand for a brief remarkable time. The lampposts answered in order and then on purpose; iron does not sing, but if iron did sing, this would have been it.

The chorus moved like an old rumor with good shoes: from the square to the river to the bridge to Rope Lane and back up to the Amber Room, and in each place it made a space not for a speech but for a listening that hurt a little. People stood with their hands open because that had been the posture taught to them by the afternoon, and while the lamplighters were busy standing, which is a craft when done correctly, the Brigadier was busy not making arrests, which is a different craft, and the Prime Arbiter was busy not calling this a drill, which turned out to be the most difficult craft of the evening.

They brought the Rag to the water again not because they believed in repetition for power but because they had discovered repetition had a smell they could follow. The ferry horn had learned to blow grief without apology and made a kind of music that refused to be called a tune. Inez said asylum into the open hand she had made of both hands, because it was for more than one person now, and the river took the word and rolled it in its mouth and set it under its tongue and kept it there the way you keep a small seed to see whether it will decide to become a tree. The lamplighters lifted their hooks. The iron sounded an answer that could have been the verb to shelter in some older language.

Soot came down off his lamppost not because he was done with the sky but because his body insisted on ground now and then. He stood beside Inez and said so quietly that the river had to stretch to hear it, “We can’t keep it safe forever. The word. The Rag. The city. It all gets used. We have to prefer wear to rot,” and she wished to argue and found she did not have to because he had presented her with a conclusion he had already made and simply wanted to see in someone else’s mouth. She pressed her shoulder against his so his body would know he had not said it to emptiness.

The river sent up something that had been leather and had decided to be a page. It bore writing that had survived water because the hand that wrote it had believed in oil and secrets, and the first line was readable in the lamplight because iron had chosen to help. It was not Article Seven, or not only, because there are more than seven principles necessary to keep a ball from being simply a ball. It said: On the Opening of Things, and under that: That which is stitched can be unstitched by a quorum of hands not known to each other who agree to see rather than to own. The lamplighters made the small sound people make when they recognize their grandmother in the mirror of a stranger. The Brigadier rubbed his forehead and invented, briefly, the idea of sitting down. The Prime Arbiter took off his shoes for a second to admit he was human and then put them back on as armor. Needle, who loved rules that admitted to their mechanisms, took the page and did not put it in his pocket; he held it so the lampposts could read.

Pel appeared when it was nearly too late for drama to do anything but make everyone tired. He came along the railing with his hat in his hands like a man who knows hats are a kind of halo and he is not currently in that play. He looked smaller than his rumors and larger than his clothes and older than his joke about saints and toothaches. He did not touch the Rag, because he had resisted the temptation to become the person in the story who touches things. He addressed the water and not the assembled on purpose.

“We are unbuilding a throne,” he said, and his voice had been kept in a pocket and was glad to be let out. “We are not burning the seat. We are taking the nails out where you can see the nails. When the chair falls apart it can be a bench or a ladder or firewood or an accident. I want you to see that. I want to be stopped when I am wrong. I want you to stop me.”

Soot made a soft noise that had two syllables and no letters. The Brigadier almost said “arrest him” and did not. Inez felt the urge to take Pel’s wrist and mark him blue and call that courage, and then she thought better of making herself into the kind of person who needs dye to memorialize a thought. Miri drew a picture she would not print, of a man saying something laudable and being punished appropriately by a draft.

When they unlaced the Rag after, because performing humility in public teaches you to trust your own knots, they found another tin with another map. This one was not a chorus. It was a set of times and places and instruments, and under the list a single sentence written in a schoolroom hand that had been taught to take pride in clarity: Bring the Rag to the Gymnasium at noon, when the gulls have already judged the wind, and let seven hands not known to each other see inside the Football in the place where it learned to be a ball. The signature was a small drawing of a kettle with steam rendered convincingly in three lines.

Inez pressed her fingers against the drawing until the lines transferred the smallest dust of graphite to her skin, and she thought, not angrily, not even with exasperation, that the day had decided she deserved to live on a cusp. The Gymnasium, where the first game had been played by the Orangatari and the Bright-Faced Baboons with bare feet and inspiration and poor rules; the Gymnasium, with its cupboards and its jokes about knobs; the Gymnasium, home to a hundred small betrayals of dust and sweat and song. She saw the seven hands, and the ones she saw were not her own. She saw a lamplighter’s hand and a baker’s hand and a boy’s hand with loquat sugar on it and a guard’s hand she could trust to soften around an object and not squeeze, and she saw her own hand only afterward, holding a pencil. She felt Kettle’s jealousy as if it were a breeze.

After the words had been said and the river’s hour had been kept, after the lamplighters had named their posts goodnight and the choruses had folded back into iron, after the Brigadier had declined to name anything he admired and the Prime Arbiter had allowed himself to be poor at ritual, Inez walked home by way of the schoolyard because dawn’s decision to be later tomorrow had made night brave enough to be longer. The cut goalposts had been strung with a narrow band of cloth that someone had embroidered in a hurry with letters too small to be actual propriety, and she leaned close to read them and found that the line said: DO NOT BLAME THE FIELD, BUT REMEMBER WHERE TO STAND. She touched the words with her mouth like a joke she had told to good effect once and might, if asked, tell again until it worked on people she did not enjoy.

At her window the brass star and the tin cylinder had become companions, and the washer with the gull kept company with the strike key and allowed itself to be warmed by whatever suffered in her pockets. She set the new page under the old, which is a private blasphemy, and she laid Kettle on the chair not because she was done with writing but because writing wanted to be surprised by being asked to wake in the night. She lay down and let her body count without numbers, and at some hour that lived between laws she heard the cutlery of the terrarium move one hair of sound, and the city took that noise and laid it between truce and asylum and waited for her to spend it tomorrow.Chapter 10

Morning arrived already pretending it had been hard at work while she slept, and Inez, suspicious of industry that began without her, put her feet on the floor as if interviewing it for the job of holding her up. The bakery had burned its first pan of sugar on purpose to awaken the street, and the scent of scorched sweetness had threaded itself through rope and lintel, under cuffs and into collarbones, a traveling salesman with a single product and excellent timing. She found Kettle where she had left it, sulking under the chair with its ribbon caught on a nail like a prank it had played on itself, and she untangled it with the patience a day demands from machines if it is to avoid punishing people. On the sill the brass star and the lozenge tin had reached an agreement about who would catch the sun first; they took turns, which was more than you could say for most institutions. Soot announced himself by knocking on the banister with two knuckles and a rhythm he claimed he had learned from a sparrow with strong opinions about oatmeal, and when he presented her with half a quince wrapped in paper that had once introduced a new oath to the city, she understood he had woken early enough to eavesdrop on hunger.

“They’re comparing lists of collars,” he said, keeping one hand on the rail as if he intended to walk down the stairs that way all day to remind gravity that charm could be a safety device. “Three guilds and a dozen men who don’t like admitting to belonging to any household are going to see which posts have whispers nest-building inside them. The lamplighters are pretending to be offended, which for them is ceremony. The Brigadier is pretending to be bored, which for him is appetite.”

“We’ll need the seven hands before noon,” Inez said, sliding Kettle’s strap over her head and knuckling the window to make sure the day was paying attention. “Not the same seven as last time, and not seven that can be accused of being a parade in disguise. Someone asked us to let strangers see inside the Football in the place where it learned to be a ball. If we make a small crowd of favorites, Pel will sulk and call us a pageant.”

“Pel calls breakfast a pageant,” Soot said, with uncharacteristic disloyalty that sounded like affection that had gone to seed and made itself into humor. “But yes. Seven hands that have not mistaken each other’s names at a market. A lamplighter who does not tell stories to everything. A baker who admits to saving the broken loaves for herself. A boy who hasn’t yet discovered how uninteresting adults can be. A guard who has never been promoted quickly enough for his mother. A ferry man with both his days. And a person who hates his own thumbs even after marriage.”

“The carpenter remarried his wrists,” she reminded him, pleased to discover that keeping track of other people’s resentments had become a light sport rather than an injury. “We’ll take Ferna below, if she’s willing to spend an hour without her oven’s complaints. The lamplighter elder who knows how to hold iron by scolding it. Two-Tides, because he listens to river grammar even when dry. Quin, if he can tear himself from sweeping lines that do not wish to be moved. A guard with clean boots. A child with loquats. And a person who has never touched a ball.”

“You’ve just described a religion and a prank,” Soot said, grinning without letting himself enjoy the grin too much. “I’ll fetch the lamplighter. You fetch the appetite.”

Ferna had the forearms of a saint who had chosen bread over martyrdom, and when Inez asked her to come put a hand on a Rag at noon in a place with terrible acoustics and a habit of frightening men into speeches, she wiped cinnamon from her fingers and said she could spare an hour as long as the hour understood it would be paying interest. The lamplighter elder wore her coat folded over one arm as if to remind it who was in charge and took the strike key from Inez without looking, the way some women take your pulse by putting their hand on your elbow. Two-Tides agreed in a way that made his mustache nod independently and instructed a boy to shout to the gulls that he was at liberty; the boy refused and they compromised at a whistle. Quin was at the stadium, hips moving like a metronome that liked jokes, and he came as soon as he had declared out loud that dust had its own agenda and must be allowed one victory per morning. The guard, after careful selection, was the colobus with the ribboned cap whose eyes could count panic faster than panic could count itself, and when Inez asked he pretended he had other work and then admitted he preferred work quieter than this. The child came with a basket half full of loquats because Poppy was somewhere else making adults remember what the word “no” tastes like, and the boy’s name turned out to be Hark for reasons his mother would tell only under duress. The last hand belonged to a woman who mended nets that had become maps by accident; she had nothing to do with carpentry and everything to do with mending the places where ropes and promises had gone soft. She hated her thumbs because they lied about their competence, and she agreed to come because she wanted to hate something new for an hour.

The Prime Arbiter met Inez at Echo Square with a look that made breakfast wonder if it had been under-seasoned. He wore a jacket with one thread pulled at the cuff, which for him was a confession, and when she showed him the kettle-drawn instruction rolled out like a child’s commandment, he did not ask who had drawn it. He did not ask whether she trusted the letter or the person behind it. He asked whether the Gymnasium was ready to bear witness without cracking its own jokes at the wrong time, which proved he had walked there once as a boy and had picked up one of the leather balls and been surprised when it did not lean into his hand. Brigadier Plume had no intention of permitting anything to occur without his disapproval, and he exercised it quietly because words spoken too loudly in the face of tradition count as surrender. Needle held two lists, one of the seven hands and one of the clauses that might be invoked if the seven produced something the city could not make fit in its mouth, and he told both he was not married to them.

They took the rope bridge together because the bridges prefer to be believed in by a crowd, and Miri came along with a bag that looked casual and contained a needle-book, a folded headline, and a lemon with its name carved under the skin. The gulls had already made their morning judgment on the wind and were now engaged in exacting small revenge on any loose paper that had pretended to be immune to air. The field of the stadium slept with its face turned to the wall like a child pretending it couldn’t hear its name, and the Gymnasium sat at the edge of Echo Square like a bowl that had been asked to be a hat. Its doors were carved with great seriousness by someone who had believed sport was a sibling of war and had been gently corrected by the children who had decorated the carvings with chalk mustaches.

Inside, the place was colder than it had any right to be given all the sweat it had been paid. The old lion’s head gleamed in the corridor where the locker rooms kept their jokes, and Quin could not resist pressing the cheekbone even though the door had already consented to being there. The echo in the Gymnasium tasted of varnish and accidents, and the way Inez understood accidents had made it better at being an audience. The square where the officiants stood had been chalked and then scuffed and then redrawn and then scuffed again, and it had the look of a word a person cannot stop writing when he is rehearsing an apology. Pigeons had not been admitted, which improved the decorum and worsened the theater, and the seven they had gathered stood in a sort of circle that avoided being a ring because they were not prepared to be captured by their own sincerity.

“Seven hands,” the lamplighter elder said, her voice visiting each word as if it were a shop she had not inspected in a year. “Not seven souls. Hands will do. Unaligned and disinclined to pretend otherwise.” She took off her coat and folded it once, the way you fold a question before putting it in your pocket in case it hatches into a plan later. Ferna wiped sugar on her apron and decided which palm was less honest and showed that one; Two-Tides bared fingers nicked by ropes that had not yet learned diplomacy; Quin looked at his own hands as if surprised they were part of his arms; the colobus guard opened his left palm and kept the right closed until the elder nodded and then opened that one too, revealing a blue thread that could have been dye or mischief or prayer; Hark offered both, one sticky with fruit and one clean because boys are unknowable; the net-mender pressed thumbs she hated against the Rag with such tenderness that the Rag loved her at once.

The Minister of Sound positioned himself where the Gymnasium would hear him. He looked at the rafters as if to ask whether birds had ever hidden contraband there and decided to sing toward the floor, because floors keep secrets but make better conduits than ceilings. Inez held the Rag with Miri and Quin, which was not quite the same as holding a law and not quite the same as carrying laundry. The Rag had a temperature that did not belong to cloth and a smell that did not belong to buttons, and when they set it in the chalked square and circled it once—for luck, for alignment, for the satisfaction of making the Brigadier roll his eyes—they found that the thing wanted a second circle and a third, because numbers have appetites and are modest about them only when you are telling them to children.

“See inside,” Inez said quietly, not to anyone and not to the Rag and not to the idea of a ball, but to the air that had decided to become a kind of water for an hour, and the lamplighter elder nodded as if approving a trick somebody else had invented. The seven put their hands on the Rag and did not look at each other. The Minister hummed a note that you would not call a note if you did not intend to be generous, and the Rag did something cloth should not do, which was accept the tone and return it with edits. Quin closed his eyes and tasted something; Hark opened his and tasted the same thing; Ferna swore softly in a dialect reserved for burnt sugar and ungrateful dough and wiped her palm on her skirt because seeing is work and she did not want it slipping.

The first sight was not sight. It was lemon, but not the ordinary lemon that sits on a counter being yellow at you; it was peel scorched just until the oil wakes up and remembers it’s a scent. Then pepper, the kind that lives in a pocket to be thrown by lovers and thieves. Then blue, not color but bruise and rumor and elderberry under the tongue. The Rag told their palms the story of being held by a thousand hands, and then it allowed pictures like catalog cards glimpsed out of order. A strap of leather with three missing stars. A line of handwriting that had been rubbed until the words were smears and the smears were laws. A ribbon that smelled like kettles and laboratories and a child’s prank disguised as a city’s plan. They did not yet see the inside of a ball; they saw the bones of its grammar.

“Bring him down a note,” Needle said, not looking at the Minister of Sound because compliments spoil men at the exact wrong moment, and the Minister did, stepping the hum into a lower octave that made the Gymnasium remember what it had felt like to be a warehouse of winter. The Rag warmed a degree, and the chink inside it—the little tooth of tin inside the cloth—settled against one of Inez’s finger bones as if being recognized. The lamplighter elder breathed out hard enough to blow a strand of hair from her cheek, and she muttered a phrase to iron that Inez did not know but understood as please behave. Two-Tides, who had never liked looking into things unless they were water and had consented to be shallow, laid his palm flat and waited, and the Rag rewarded him with a picture that belonged to him: a ferry rope stained by hot fruit, a child’s shoe, and a splinter with old varnish in it that would have delighted a carpenter if one had been invited.

“We’re there,” Miri whispered, and no one had asked where there was, but all of them knew it meant wherever the Football was being itself without witnesses. The Rag made itself trustworthy by not pretending to be a window; it behaved like what it was, which is to say a Rag, and yet it allowed their hands to read. Under the leather, under the stitching, there was a pocket, not large, not empty. In it, a folded shape that had once been a circle and had been taught to be a square by a person who did not excel at gentleness. In the fold, a line in a childish hand that had learned letters by copying signs: IF FOUND, DO NOT RETURN, TEACH. The breath came out of the group in a measure that made the Minister of Sound pause and adjust because sincerity had tripped his tempo.

“It’s a skulled-up lesson,” the lamplighter elder said, irritated by ideas that pretend to be weight, and Quin laughed once under his breath and felt guilty for liking the phrase. The Rag offered another image to the colliding palms: not a map exactly, but a spiral, a whale in a teacup, a playfield drawn into the skin itself the way some men put prayers where their chest hair can dissuade their wives from arguing with theology. And then, while Brigadier Plume discovered he was gripping the hilt of a blade he was not allowed to draw and the Prime Arbiter discovered he was pressing his lips together the way a man does when he knows he could talk himself out of his own house, the Rag let them see the thing that neither believed and both should have expected.

Inside the Football, between leather and law, was a pocket of quiet. The mufflers had a relative that had chosen domicile in a sphere. It was not silence as a lack, which is a poor diet, but quiet as a presence, which is a delicacy that breeds honesty in rooms that do not deserve it. It was lined with hair from a lamplighter’s horse-tail brush and wool from a scarf an orangutan had worn to make ministers nervous and a shred from a curtain in the Amber Room ripped by accident the day someone had practiced saying sorry. It held the city’s hush the way an instrument holds the possibility of being tuned. It had been sealed and resealed with a thread saved from the first Rag someone stitched because the ball was late to a vote and their mothers had taught them how to mend.

Hark took his hand away as if he had touched something electric and delicious. Ferna laughed and cried in the same breath, which is the specialty of bakers asked to believe that their work makes rooms kinder. Two-Tides said the word well in a way that had nothing to do with holes in the ground, and the lamplighter elder said a prayer for seams and added a threat in case they became boastful. The colobus guard looked as if he had been accused of tenderness and had no intention of pleading guilty but would not fight the charge. The net-mender did not speak, because words break when they try to describe the right kind of quiet, and mending remains the better craft. The Minister of Sound set his tone down on the floor in front of them and let it go out for a walk.

“We can use this,” Brigadier Plume said, voice steady, which is when he is most dangerous, and the Prime Arbiter said, “We must refuse to use it,” with that weary authority that makes the room consider picking better men more quickly. Needle looked at Inez and not at the Rag and said, “This is why it lives in a case. Not because we are precious, but because we are greedy.”

“It wanted to be used,” Hark said, offended on behalf of the ball, which had never asked to be a collector of ethics. “Else why put it inside a thing that is meant to be touched.” Miri passed him a loquat because argument goes better with sugar and because adults must be reminded to feed children who tell the truth. The lamplighter elder placed her palm back down and felt for the seam, and if a woman could unpick a god with her fingernails she would have, but respect held her wrist.

The Rag finished showing them what they had asked for and, with a dignity that belongs to household objects, stopped. It lay on the chalk with buttons that pretended to be sleeping. The seven took their hands away in the distrustful order of people who have been asked to rejoin their bodies after a long journey. The Gymnasium held its breath like a crowd outside a nursery. Miri wiped her eyes with the back of one hand and improvised a joke about onions, which is how she confesses to being overwhelmed without burdening anyone else with her sincerity. Quin, left in charge of the broom by default and personality, set it against the wall so he would not be tempted to sweep away lines before they had done their work. Soot, who had been sitting on the edge of a bench ready to stand at the wrong moment to distract someone from doing harm, unfolded his legs and made the wrong moment into the right one by sitting again.

“We cannot counterfeit this,” the Prime Arbiter said, more to the Rag than to the room, and then to the room, because he was that kind of man, “We cannot announce that we knew all along, because we did not. We cannot announce that we will never use it, because hunger is very persuasive and there will come a night when a law wishes to sleep. We can announce that anyone using quiet without seven hands at the same time will be considered impolite to the point of exile, which is the only law I can enforce today without throwing up.”

“Disgust is an underrated instrument,” Needle murmured, making a note in a hand that belonged to a better version of his younger self. “It keeps bravery from becoming theater, and theater from becoming war.”

Brigadier Plume walked the perimeter of the chalked square and did not cross it, because he liked rules when they were watching him. He said, with the precision of a man building a bridge out of his own teeth, “The thief knew. He used the quiet to take the mufflers and will use the quiet again to make courage sound like guilt. He left us maps, stars, scraps, songs. He is building a lesson instead of a fort. We will stop him if he tries to make children into an army, and we will let him go if what he builds turns out to be a school.”

“We will stop ourselves if we start running because running is an addiction,” Miri added, because the free paper had become an organ of her ribcage and insisted on being included. “We will print recipes that end badly if you don’t pay attention, as a warning to men who think following directions is always safety. We will write words like truce and asylum until they taste ordinary, and then we will retire them and own new words that hurt our mouths better.”

“Troop to the Amber Room,” the lamplighter elder said, gathering her coat. “Iron has to approve of what we saw or it becomes spiteful. Put your eye to your glass and let the terrarium behave like an honest liar for once.”

They carried the Rag in courtesy and not as a relic, which made Inez ache with a kind of pride that was unseemly on an empty stomach. Out in the hall, Pel appeared at the far end like a moral that had considered arriving on time and then chosen a more dramatic entrance. He kept his hands in his pockets as a sign of respect and cowardice, in equal shares. He tilted his head so the light struck his hat in a way that would make a clever artist regret choosing pen over chalk, and he did not move to block the procession because he did not want to be kicked out of the story for once.

“You’ll get your lesson,” he said, and it was almost apologetic, which is to say he had either slept poorly or done something kind. “You will not get your ball until I am bored or the city is ready to play without being instructed. The quiet is not mine; I can’t ruin it. I can only frighten people into hearing it. You are welcome.”

“You are a rumor with legs,” Soot told him in passing, mild as milk once it learns about cinnamon. “You do not get a parade for doing what all rumors do. You get patience and a watch. If you run, we will not chase you until it is funny.”

The Amber Room had learned a new trick while they were away, which is how rooms survive chronic attention. The terrarium had collected not just condensation but language. On the inside of the glass, under the crescent smears of river-mud blue, where a seam had pretended to be tranquility, there was writing. It was not neat; the glass made it wobble; the blue caught on some points and not others; but there were marks that had not been there yesterday and could not be anybody’s desire disguised as reality. Article Seven had growths now. There were birds again and the river again and a marginal note in a hand that had never learned the difference between an essay and a love letter: Seven hands make a door. Do not leave it open out of politeness.

The lamplighter elder put both hands on the glass as if to touch the writing through it and then withdrew them because she had been taught to respect things that volunteer their truths. The Minister of Sound leaned close and hummed a question at the pane and the pane, because it was a better instrument today, hummed the question back with one note improved. Brigadier Plume said nothing which, for a man addicted to naming, was a decalogue of consent. Needle wrote nothing either, which in him was the sound of wonder. The Prime Arbiter turned his head so the line of his jaw lost its claim to authority for one second and then let it find itself again, because a face is often a compromise between what you intend and what the city will believe.

“We’ll put the Rag in the case for an hour,” Inez said, and nobody laughed, so she hurried, “With the latch open, so it is not a prison, only a bed.” Miri frowned that agreeable frown she made when she suspected a woman she loved was about to volunteer herself to be useful and miserable at the same time. Soot shrugged and said he would rather stand on a lamppost and tell lies about the truth than sit in a chair and tell truths about lies, which was his way of giving his consent to a plan that might ask him to be brave in an inconvenient shape.

They settled the Rag into the curve of glass, and for a moment the fabric behaved like water in a bowl and the bowl behaved like a lap and the city considered clapping for itself and refused. The Mud-and-Blue wrote nothing new; the seam did not unzip in gratitude; the latch did not learn the art of being closed again without scraping. The brass stars on the table winked in a way that should have offended the Brigadier and instead made him patient. The strike key in Inez’s pocket warmed her hip as if anticipating a collar argument later with a post that had been named The Lying One for valid reasons. The copy of Article Seven with birds lay beside the one without birds like twins who had been separated at birth and reunited at an awkward age.

“Tomorrow,” the Prime Arbiter said, as if the word were a verb his body knew how to perform without rehearsal. “Tomorrow we meet at the Gymnasium again with seven hands and pick a new word to spend. The lamplighters will stand. The river will be present if invited correctly. We will continue to refuse to counterfeit. We will continue to prefer wear to rot. Brigadier, continue not arresting people in ways that make them forgive you for existing. Needle, take what maps you must without borrowing anyone’s grandmother. Minister, make a tune out of an hour that men can hum while carrying wood.”

“And you,” Miri asked him, mouth tilted, pencil behind ear like the wing of a blackbird who had agreed to be mistaken for an ornament until it suited it to fly, “What is your verb.”

“Endure,” he said, and his honesty made the room lean toward him the way bread leans toward butter, “and apologize faster,” and his cowardice made him likable enough to survive another day.

On the rope bridge back, the gulls had decided to pretend to be weather again because being gods had bored them. The river had learned truce and asylum and vacationed on both. The lamplighter elder took Inez’s washer with the gull engraved on it and palmed it as if to improve its balance and slipped it back with a warning that sounded like affection’s older sister. Ferna returned to the oven and insulted a loaf into behaving better than it would have otherwise. Two-Tides rolled his shoulders as if shaking off a coat soaked with agreement and called to the boy with the whistle that the tide was honest today. Quin went back to sweeping lines that would need to be drawn again and made no complaint because men who love edges accept that compromise is a broom. The net-mender licked one thumb and smoothed a story that had snagged on a knot. The colobus with the ribboned cap went back to his post to look at men with the eyes of someone who had seen the inside of a ball and knew it contained quiet, which is to say danger and rescue at once.

Soot walked at Inez’s pace, which meant he briefly understood what obligation feels like in the muscles. Pel did not walk with them because he had been given the gift of being ignored and did not want to squander it. Miri folded the lemon carved with its name into her pocket next to the headline she had drafted and redrafted and would now abandon for something that had not yet introduced itself. The brass star and the tin waited on the sill for night to be a drinkable thing again. Kettle sulked in its satchel and forgave her without a sound, because forgiveness is the one thing it does without hissing.

Inez climbed the baker’s stairs like a woman who had spent her hour correctly and been paid in heat and the possibility of sleep. She put one hand on the frame of her window and thanked it for remembering how to hold the glass, and then she set the washer with the gull next to the brass star and the tin, because emblems teach each other patience even when their metals disagree. She wrote nothing because the day had already written itself on her palms; she licked her thumb by accident and tasted pepper and lemon and the peculiar sweetness of quiet when it has been shared. In the bed that had learned the shape of a woman lying with plans under her pillow she placed nothing except herself, because tonight she was the only contraband that mattered. The city kept count without her, which is the kind of love you can trust even when you should not, and she let herself be held.
