The wind that came off the bay in Saint Ives had the same habit every morning: it rolled up the slopes of the links with a tang of salt and kelp and flung itself over the gorse, tumbling into the hollows like a dog that forgets it has bones. Jory Penhaligon liked to think the wind remembered him. He was on the second tee at dawn, long before the clubhouse clinked its glasses awake, long before the gaudy umbrellas appeared at the harbour or the artists set out their little folding chairs beneath the pale sky. Between breathing and swinging, the world had a way of flattening into silence, and this, more than anything, had become the point.

He had made a church of the dew. He could see his breath in it when he addressed the ball, and the tiny green spheres trembled on millions of overlapping blades. One practice swing. Another. The ball rose, split the cool air, fell out on the edge of the fairway where the ground sloped veeringly toward a bunker. You could stand all day on that tee and make the same swing and never get the same result. It was not an exact science, not the kind people thought. There were days when the club face acted like a stranger in the house. Days it came home singing.

“Jory,” yelled a voice from the path behind the dunes. “You floggin it already? It’s not even six.”

He didn’t turn; he knew the timbre. Nate Bullen had been club captain for four years and bore himself like the town had given him authority over the tides. There was another voice with him, the breathy laugh of someone who smoked too much, the groundsman, Daz. Jory finished his follow-through, set the club back in the bag with care.

“Couldn’t sleep, Nate,” he said. “Wind’s fair.”

Nate tromped onto the tee in his brogues and sweater with the stupid little crest, a silver fish wriggling from a crown. Daz hovered near the gorse, hands in the pockets of a hi-vis jacket that had seen too many paint jobs.

“What are you at these days?” Nate asked, squinting into the lower light. “You gonna chase numbers this season? We need you for county again. Don’t say you won’t.”

Jory lifted a shoulder. The sky carried a strip of pink in it, and the gulls were cutting onions over the water. He was thirty-four and had the face of someone who’d forgotten to complain. His hair went curly when any damp happened to it at all, which was always in Saint Ives, and he couldn’t bring himself to trim the beard beyond the point where his mother would wave a shears and threaten him at Sunday tea.

“I’m going quiet this year,” he said.

“Quiet?” Daz echoed, as if quiet were a theory, like string or relativity. “He says quiet.”

Nate crossed his arms. “Quiet how?”

Jory looked down at his shoes. There were little flecks of sand all along the laces. He could feel the sentence in his mouth, the way some words carry splinters. If he said it now he couldn’t unsay it and a part of him was eager for the pain of it. The idea had been sitting in him like a stone he couldn’t pass.

“I’m stopping,” he said, lightly, as if describing the weather, as if no one would bother to remember. “Done with competitions. Done with the club after the Medal. Might… I’m thinking of going off.”

“Off?” Nate laughed. “Off where? You’re one of the few keeping us holders together. What’s this? A little break? Go hit the tourist free course at West Cornwall for a fortnight. Come back with a tan.”

“Not West Cornwall,” he said. “I mean… off. Out. I’ve been reading. Anchorites and such.”

Daz snorted. Nate frowned, because he had a collection of expressions he wore like ties and the frown was for joking you were not sure was a joke.

“You mean hermits,” Nate said. He tossed the word like a crumb to a gull.

Jory nodded. He had been careful not to say it to anyone. He had said it in his head spread out over long evenings when the town was heavy with the rumour of other people’s meals, and he had said it to the gulls when he mailed letters at dusk—h e r m i t—half hoping the word would break, become smaller. Instead it had widened. He’d been up on the moor where the granite sits like a thought, and in the little ruined cottages where it’s always Sunday and no one is home.

“Do me a favour,” Nate said. “Don’t talk that rot before I’ve had coffee.”

“Right,” said Jory, almost smiling. “I’ll see you later.”

“Where do you even… hermit,” Daz muttered to his own boots.

Jory carried his bag into the wind and played that second hole the way he always did when people were watching, a little too cautiously, a par with a putt he didn’t love. As he walked to the third he felt the tug of the town behind him: the houses stacked up terraces, the bright shopfronts with their flaking paint, the smell of bread from the bakery that had changed hands six times and still got the crust wrong. The harbour, busiest at unnatural hours, and the benches facing the lifeboat where old women ate chips like communion with vinegar. Every place had its habit. His own was leaving conversations before they filled with foam.

He could say he’d trained himself by playing early. That it was the golf that had made him want to slip out of the public. But it would be simpler, if you were to ask him properly, to admit that he had always preferred to press his ear to the quietest corner of a room. He liked the white on a wave not the crash. He liked the intermissions. He had scores. He had local record cards framed by other men behind the bar and the sort of reputation that attaches itself like a chuckle in a crowded space. The improbable chip-in on eight. The morning he holed out from one. The day in the gale when the ball tilted like a soul and somehow fell.

But what people did not see—and this is not their fault, though he blamed them—is that the thing he was good at had turned into a mirror he had to stand in front of every day. You were not meant to live with a mirror hungry for your face.

His mother did not want him to grow a beard. She also did not want him to move into a stone hut above Zennor with his books, a flint and a pan. On the evening he told her, in the kitchen that smelled like carrots under the Sunday roast, she hit him with a tea towel so lightly he almost cried from the pity of it.

“A hermit,” Morwenna said. “What would your father say.”

“Dad used to walk the coast path for fun,” he said. “He moved into a boat for five years when he was younger than me.”

“That’s not a hermit. That’s a fisherman.”

“It’s not religious, mam. Or not religion in the way you mean.”

She plunked a plate in front of him with mash piled like a hill. She was a small woman who could halt a fight with a glance, and she had a reputation among a certain kind of painter for placing extraordinary flowers in jars. The house, with its leaky windows, was full of those strange blooms; the scent of lilies tried to drown the sea.

“You’ll get thin,” she said. “And you’ll get daft. People who shut themselves in huts get daft.”

“I’ll still see you,” he said. “And Lew.”

“Lew will laugh,” Morwenna said, not unkindly.

Lew laughed, later, at the pub. “You’ll be the first hermit to play off two, Joy. What’s the point in being holy if you can wedge from the rough like that?”

“I’m not trying to be holy.”

“Then what? You’ll embarrass mam if you grow a beard like Moses. You’ll scare the tourist kids. And what will you do for money—hmm? Sell shells from your hermit door.”

Jory had thought about money and been confused by his own answer. He did not want much. He had a bit. He could do some work at the boatyard, he could take the odd job when someone needed something solved, he could sell his old clubs (no he couldn’t), he could guide a few walkers along the headland for cash and then show them where to be quiet. He could make a list of the small services that take a place to pieces and put it back together.

“It’s not about money,” he said, which didn’t exactly satisfy the pub. Lew shook his head. The group around the table shifted the way groups do when the thing at stake is hard to name. Someone changed the subject to football. Someone else told a story about a holiday they’d taken years ago. Morwenna went up to the bar to speak to Mab, who poured pints like a priestess, and when she came back she had a face on that meant she had accepted something she had not forgiven.

The next morning he walked the headland toward Clodgy Point. It was gull weather, and a seal blinked at him from the whirling water. He had a notebook, the cheap kind you buy by accident at the post office, and he made a list without dates:

- look at the ruined place above Zennor again
- talk to Rev. Hendra about anchorites
- get rid of the telly
- call club about leaving after the Medal
- find out if there's a permit for hermiting? (lol)
- make a stove
- tell Lena next door so she doesn’t think it’s a sulk

Lena next door was a potter whose bent was toward large earthenware bowls that looked like the inside of a hill. She’d lived in Saint Ives for nine years and still said sometimes that she was going to go back and finish something in Bristol, as if this town had interrupted her mid-sentence. She had a ginger cat who thought it was a dog, and a laugh that entered rooms before she did. She had never known Jory as anything but quiet, which is to say she mistook his presence for an ambient sound, like the low hum of the extractor fan in the kebab shop that never switched off.

When he told her, she had a thread of clay across her forearm, drying into a parchment map of the Penwith.

“A hermit,” she said. “I always wanted to meet one. Can I bring you pots?”

“If you bring me a pot I won’t have anything to put in it.”

“Stones perhaps,” she said. “Tea bags. The old year.”

He smiled. He liked the way she lived her sentences. Lena did not know it, but her own flat was a kind of hermitage; it smelled of earth and lemon rind, and there were slips of paper with words—single words—pinned to the corkboard above her sink. One read: truth. Another: salt. Another: margin. She made him coffee and handed him a biscuit that had lost track of time.

“You won’t be lonely?” she asked. It was a question that had the shape of a worry with too many corners.

“Lonelier here,” he said without bravado, and immediately regretted it because there were ways of saying that which made you sound like you’d written it in a song.

She cupped her mug with both hands. “You know,” she said, “I’ve been thinking of getting help. Not that kind. Someone with a plan. I get stuck in my lists. It all rolls around and then I don’t see anyone for two days. I start to believe the cat has opinions about my life.”

“A plan?”

“A coach. For life. What a phrase. But I saw a card at the deli, cream paper with a gold stamp. Cassia Bloom. Life architecture. There’s a phone number that remembers its own rhythm.”

He laughed. “Architecture for life.”

“Don’t you smirk. You’re the one running away into a hut.”

“I’m not running,” he said. And then, quietly, “or I am.”

“Do you know what I think?” she said. “Sometimes the problem is that everyone’s watching. You probably do better on an empty course. I make better bowls when nobody says: are you making bowls.”

He nodded. He had thought it, and she had made it sound like a bright coin. “I’ll be nearby,” he said. “It’s not Peru.”

“You’ll be on a hill above Zennor with a pan,” she said. “I won’t pretend I’m not a little jealous.”

Rev. Hendra was not what anyone would imagine when the word anchorite came up. He dressed like a geography teacher on a field trip and had a smile that made you believe you’d dropped something and he was about to bend and pick it up. The church on the bluff above Porthmeor was small and smelled of dust under salt.

“Anchorites,” the reverend said, leaning on the rail as if he might push it where he needed. “We had one in Cornwall in the old days. Several. Or at least we had people who pretended to be. People made windows into the side of the church and someone would live inside with food like a kindness. People came and asked for advice. People always like a window. They don’t like a wall.”

“I don’t want a window,” Jory said, feeling foolish, hearing the smallness in his own words: it was very hard to explain that you want to go and be silent without sounding like you want people to stop speaking. “I want to go and listen.”

“You could take vows,” Rev. Hendra said, though his eyes said he wasn’t serious. “It’s a useful binding, sometimes, to tie your life to a word. Nevertheless, you might start small. A week alone. Then two.”

“I’ve been alone before.”

“Not like this, I reckon.”

A pair of tourists clattered into the church with their phones held like torches, murmured about the stained glass, and left a minute later as if the place had performed for them slightly too long. Hendra looked after them and rubbed his forehead.

“If God is in your plan at all,” he said, “make a little room for him to arrive in the way he prefers, which is sideways. And if he’s not, then make a little room for the other thing. The absence. It, too, knocks.”

Jory walked back along the road with a feeling in him like he’d eaten something he couldn’t name. He wanted to do this. It did not rest on any particular burn; there was no scandal, no wound he could present to a nosy aunt. He wanted to do this because a tide had turned in him. He had won the County Medal twice and both times had felt, three hours later, like someone else had collected a parcel with his name on it.

The clubhouse that afternoon was full of the afterglow of men who’d shot 90 and pretended they’d aimed at it. There were trophies set up on a table as if they were waiting to be introduced to a bride. Captain Nate was holding court at a corner table; his hand had a way of describing circles that made you dizzy if you watched too long.

“Jory,” someone said as he came in. It was Mab from behind the bar, her hair up in an untidy nest, her fringe taking liberties. “You look like a saint.”

“I feel like a dented spoon,” he said.

“Have a lemonade, then.”

He took his glass and sat near the window where the late light made everything want to change. There was a photograph on the wall above him of the 1963 team, all of them with a grim determination you didn’t see in modern faces. In the photograph the wind was clearly too much, and they had stuck to the course anyway. You had to admire that; you also had to pity it.

Nate clapped him on the back so hard he almost drank his own teeth. “We were saying,” Nate said, “we need you next weekend, and the one after. And then there’s County. You’ve gone quiet on me.”

“I told you,” Jory said.

Nate tilted his head. “Say it again, because saying it in the morning before the sun’s up counts for nothing.”

“I’m leaving after the Medal.” He said it without apology. “I won’t be around here much, after.”

There was a moment in which a series of words passed through Nate’s mind and were sent back unsaid. He put on his smile made of rope. “What a waste,” he said, and the room seemed to agree without hearing. “We’ve seen people get soft. We’ve seen people get married and start using words like stroller. But to throw it at the sea? To take something you do better than anyone and pack it in a trunk? Jory, for heaven’s sake.”

“It doesn’t feel like that,” Jory said. “It feels like I’ve been wearing the same hat for years and it’s started to itch.”

“You want to scratch your soul,” Nate said, and wanted it to be a joke. “Do that in the winter months. Half the course is a swamp then. We’ll hardly miss you.”

“I’ve thought about it.”

“You’ve thought about hermits.”

“Anchorites,” said Daz at another table, eavesdropping proudly, as if he knew Latin, as if he were now the club expert. “They lived in holes in the church and had little windows for food. And they cut their hair with a candle flame.”

“Have you been on Wikipedia again,” someone said.

“I told you, I read books. Sometimes.”

“Your shoes,” Mab said softly to Jory, because she had been looking and it was the kind of thing she could say and mean it as blessing, “your shoes look like they've been far. You do what you have to.”

After he left the clubhouse the light featured itself on the surface of the sea in tinfoil strips. He went down past the harbour, took the steps by the old wall where the ivy has eyes, and stood for a long time on the edge of the quay with his hands in his pockets and the world performing around him. The banksy of a fisherman flaked on the side of an abandoned hut. A child cried because an ice-cream had done the thing ice-cream always does and jumped. A woman in a red coat laughed to the gulls as if they were all men she would not forgive.

He went home to his small flat where the walls remembered the heat of summer tourists pressed into them, and he took the television down from the shelf and set it on the floor like a sleeping animal. He lifted books from stacks and put them into a box as if each had a temperature that might harm it if the others knew. He wrote a list on the back of an electricity bill: bread, oats, salt, tinder, pan, rope. The pan he had was fine. The rope he would climb a little bit only in his mind—he had no cliff to scale. He thought of everything he had made a habit of carrying with him: tees, pitch mark repairer, pencil; and looked for their equivalents in a life with more weather and fewer scorecards.

The next day he took the bus to Zennor. It wasn’t far, but it carried him out of the circuits of his thinking and laid him down among larger stones. He walked up to the ruined place on the slope above the village, where long ago a family had stretched themselves into the shape of the land and then left the imprint as if to prove it. It had two rooms that had once been rooms. Between them the wind parked. The walls had hollows where swallows might consider living. He stood in the doorway and felt something apply itself to him—like a hand pressed against his chest from the other side of the wall.

“You’ll be mine,” he said out loud, and then, embarrassed, he said to the air, “if you want.”

A lizard scrambled in the grass. Something white and small, a scrap of a shopping bag, flittered across the stone shelf like a messenger and then flicked away. The sky rolled over, colourless and the colour of every wish. He sat on the lintel with his notebook and wrote: hermitage, listening, hunger, hush. The words were like nails he could use later to hang the day on.

On his way back he stopped at the pub in Zennor where the chairs all looked like they remembered knees. A man at the bar looked at him and at his bag and at his hands and said, as men in pubs have always said since beer was invented, “You’re not from round here.”

“I’m from Saint Ives,” he said.

“Close enough,” the man said with a light contempt. “What brings you out.”

“Hunting quiet,” Jory said, because he had not learned yet how to hide.

“Plenty of it,” the man said. “You want a shepherd’s hut? They put wheels on them now. You can move when the wind gets stupid.”

“I want walls,” Jory said. “And a door.”

The man stared at him, then laughed. “Good luck with that.”

He could not tell whether he was laughing at the absurdity or the heroism; perhaps there is no difference. He drank his pint, which had the taste of metal and memory, and walked back down past the church with the mermaid in its story and the stone bench that belonged more to the air than the earth. As he waited for the bus he took out his notebook and wrote: you can’t explain calm. You don’t need to.

When the bus dropped him on the road into Saint Ives he saw Lena with her hair up in a bandanna, carrying a bag of carrots and a bag of clay. She waved at him with a carrot. “I did it,” she said as she reached him, slightly out of breath. “I called Cassia Bloom. She’s seeing me Tuesday. I paid a deposit on my life.”

“Congratulations,” he said, then, after a second, “does it sound absurd that I want to be unseen. Sometimes I say it and it sounds like hubris.”

“What is hubris if not a town that thinks it holds your history like a leash,” she said, surprising him. “You don’t have to tell anyone anything.”

“They’ll ask.”

“Not if you stop telling them,” she said, kinder. “I keep thinking if I could make a bowl big enough I’d climb in it and someone could just carry me where I need to go.”

“North,” he said. “Or west.”

“Into the sea,” she said, and then shook her head hard as if to rattle off the words. “About this Cassia. Her website—yes I checked it, I’m not entirely daft—says she helps people design rituals that make their mornings less like running. She looks as if she chews on paradoxes for breakfast. I admit I offloaded. It felt like putting down a bag I’d been carrying for a year without knowing it.”

He thought of a bag he’d been carrying for a decade. He thought of the way the weight of people’s expectation alters how a thing sits on your shoulder. He thought of the absurd kindness of being met by someone who thinks your life is a plan and not an accidental boat.

“Tell me how it goes,” he said.

“I will,” she said. “If she turns out to be a charlatan I’ll make a teapot in her shape, put it in the window for the crows to laugh at.”

They parted at the end of the lane where the cats slept on the warm bit of pavement like puddles of ginger and black. Jory looked up at his own window and saw himself already not inside it. He opened his door and put the bag down and stood in the middle of his living room not touching anything, aware of every object as if he were seeing it for the first time—this plate, this chair with one short leg, this photograph of his father with a fish and a grin, this shadow on the carpet the shape of a net.

He did not yet know that people would make of his decision a story they would tell like a warning or a joke. He did not know that there would be weeks when he would miss the sound of someone else coughing in the next room so much that he would cough, unconvincing, to see if the air answered. He did not know that his neighbour’s life coach would move through their small street like a kind of weather, changing the air in his lungs as surely as the wind on the course. He knew only that he had said a thing aloud and the world had not unmade itself. He lay down on the floor next to the television on its side, and he looked up at the ceiling where a crack ran from the window to the light as if someone had drawn a map in a hurry.

A gull cried, with the voice of trying. He made a fist and let it unclench. He had never been much for praying, but he wanted to say something to the air. He wanted to say, keep me when I am gone. He wanted to say, make me thin enough to pass between the words that hold me. He wanted to say something not grand, a small sentence, a pebble of a sentence he could put in his pocket and turn with his thumb.

He said, barely, inside his mouth, I will go. Then he waited, as if the air might answer. Only the quiet did. And it did not say no.Chapter Two

Lena swept the studio the way she always did before strangers came, with a concentration that could be mistaken for belief. Clay had a habit of lodging itself in places you would not think to look, under the table lip, in the hinge of the low window, inside the handle of a mug that had never been a mug and would never be one now. She told herself she was only moving the loose dust around because she liked the show of it catching the light, but there was an older instinct in her that wanted a clean threshold when someone new stepped in. The cat watched from the doorway with the demeanour of a shopkeeper who does not agree with the management. On the corkboard she pinned a new word—begin—and then, embarrassed by the earnestness of it, pinned another word beside it—bread—so that anyone looking could think she had been making a shopping list. She had slept badly, dreaming of bowls the size of rooms, and woke twice to the sound of gulls convening an argument that never reached its point.

Cassia Bloom came not in a car of the sort that made statements, but in a small scuffed hatchback the colour of damaging optimism. She was on time, which felt like a gift. She had a scarf wound round her hair in a band of pale blue, and a coat the shape of water, and a pair of boots that had been worn properly to the edges. There was nothing about her that announced a profession beyond a soft satchel, large enough to carry several lives in pieces, and a notebook she held with the respect you give a thing you have used to talk yourself out of trouble. She smiled like someone smiling from a doorway she had built herself. When she stepped into the studio the air did a tiny thing as if it had remembered a posture, and Lena felt at once both foolish for having prepared and justified in having done so.

They sat at the big table scarred by twelve years of mistakes, and Cassia set her notebook down and did not open it. She looked out the window at the strip of sea the studio permitted in glimpses, then back at Lena with interest that was not hungry. There are ways people listen that make you feel as if you have been draped in cloth for a ceremony you do not deserve; there are ways people listen that make you remember you are part of the furniture of a room. Cassia’s listening was neither, and it took Lena a minute to understand why she was crying a little with relief. “What happens in your mornings,” Cassia asked, not in the manner of a clipboard but as if she were asking about a place that could be walked. “What do you pick up first. What do you leave to the end because it might hurt.”

Lena told her about the kettle that had started to sound like someone trying not to cough, and the way she stood in the doorway with a mug warming her palm and looked at the bowls from the night before as if they were children she had promised to feed and did not know how to feed. She spoke of lists that were not lists so much as loops, and the strange intimacy of hiding in a room full of items that were all waiting for you to admit you had asked them to wait. She confessed what she did not confess to anyone in the street, that there were mornings when she sat on the floor in the middle of the studio because the middle seemed like the most honest place and she could not be bothered with chairs. She said she made excuses about glazing temperatures when really she was afraid of calling the kiln what it was, which was a door that sometimes refused to open back onto her life.

Cassia nodded and did nothing with her pen for a long time. “I call what I do architecture,” she said, “because it lets people believe I will produce a drawing with windows and the price of glass on it. What I actually do is measure. I measure your thresholds. I find out where the weather gets in. I put a smaller door somewhere useful so you stop leaving yourself outside.” She asked about the wrists—did they ache, and what did she do for the ache when it came. She asked whether Lena ate breakfast or only the idea of it. She asked what happened when a bowl broke. “I have glued whole afternoons back together,” Lena said, and watched Cassia’s mouth make a little fold of recognition. “Good,” Cassia said, “now tell me about your cat.”

There was a piece of paper with shapes on it that did not look like plans until Cassia pointed with the blunt end of her pen and called one of them October. She spoke about rituals in a way that made them not resemble superstition, but instead resemble railings on a walkway where the drop is beautiful enough to tempt falling. “Let’s do a small one,” she said, as if inviting a child to take the first stone from a pile that would one day be a wall. “At nine in the morning, you tie your apron twice. First knot is for making. Second knot is for seeing. When you untie the second knot, you leave whatever you are making exactly as it is and you go and drink water at the window. You are allowed to bring the cat if the cat agrees.” Lena laughed and nodded because she wanted to have been the sort of person who already tied her apron like that, and she forgave herself for not being her. Cassia asked what word should go above the sink for this month if it could not be begin, because begin was too eager and might shout. “Margin,” Lena said, looking down at her palms, which had their own map of white lines. “Margin has been good to me lately.” “Then margin it is,” said Cassia, and wrote it on a piece of tape and put it above the tap in her neat unlovely hand.

They spoke, inevitably, about the neighbour. It would have been stranger not to. “He has the expression of a man walking a long way without moving,” Cassia said, and Lena was startled into laughing because she had not told Cassia anything but the silhouette of the idea. She tried to be fair to Jory and to her own reaction to him. She said he had announced a thing that made the air in the street tilt, and that she had immediately wanted to carry it for him and equally wanted to put it back on his shoulders, as if there were any use at all in carrying a plan that was not yours. Cassia listened with that steady attention again and made a triangle with her fingers. “It will affect you,” she said. “Neighbourhood is a structure, like a ribcage. If somebody takes out a rib you breathe differently, even if you did not fancy his rib. But I like that he called it listening. People who want to be seen call their leaving something else. The ones who want to listen are less dangerous to themselves, in my line.” Lena did not want to ask Cassia to see him. She did not want to be the sort of person who introduced a neighbour to an instrument that might change the song he thought he was singing. She tucked the want into her sleeve and told herself she had only wanted words for a thing, and perhaps now she had enough.

When Cassia left she did it with an ordinary goodbye that felt like it had been lifted from a much older book. There was no lavender oil, no invoice on embossed paper. There was a scrap torn from the corner of her notebook with three tasks on it, written under each other like little steps. First, walk to Porthmeor at eight on Wednesday and pick up five stones without deciding what they are for. Second, clean the sink as if it were a friend visiting. Third, place one no on the corkboard beside all the words that were not nos, so that the rest of the week might know its shape. “The no can be small,” Cassia said. “It can be no to an invitation to be distracted. It can be no to me.” Lena held the scrap like a ridiculous treasure and then, in a reverse of her usual tendencies, put it in the drawer with the birthday candles so it would not become a fetish. She watched the little car on the road as it was absorbed by the town and felt something in her side loosen, as if a tightness had been introduced only to be undone, to remind her where it had started.

When Jory pushed open the glass door at the council office he was already smiling because the poster on the wall about dog fouling featured a cartoon terrier whose expression suggested both shame and performance. There was a plant that had given up pretending it was alive, and a woman behind the counter with hair the colour of pennies and a cardigan the colour of surrender. She asked how she could help and he said, in his best attempt at conversational bureaucracy, that he was intending to inhabit the remains of a structure on private land near Zennor for an indeterminate period of quiet, and was there a form for that. She looked at his mouth as if the words would eventually reveal a sequence that belonged to a category already in her list. “Are you placing a temporary dwelling,” she said. “Possibly,” he said. “If we could call the dwelling a you and the temporary a God.” She blinked and laughed and then caught herself laughing in case it was against policy. “We have a form for shepherd huts,” she said. “But only if the wheels are actual wheels. We have a form for conversion, but you are not converting if you are keeping the roof as it is, which is to say, not there. We have a form for change of use. I could give you that one and you could put hermit in the box where it says retail.”

He found himself talking to her about the old places on the moor that looked like thoughts with the cover taken off, and she told him about a cousin who had lived in a van by choice and who had been the only person who showed up on time for anything. She rang someone in Planning who rang someone else and then handed him a postcard with a number on it and the words “speak to Rob Trezise at the farm because whatever you do, if you are building a life, he will want to know whose it is.” He thanked her and asked whether she liked her job, because he liked to know the answer to that question when someone had spent five minutes trying to make a window in a wall. She said she liked the days when people came in to ask for things that had not yet been invented, and he left feeling as if he had just been given permission to be unfashionable.

The farm sat a little above the village and had the same easy slouch as a man who knows the weather personally. A collie with an outrageously neat face took his measure and then decided to allow him onto the yard with a sigh, as if to say that if we are going to keep letting strangers in we might as well be graceful about it. Rob Trezise came out of a shed with his forearms powdery with lime and his expression set to “see if you can do a better job than the last man who asked me a question like that.” He had a way of holding his body that suggested he had once been a child who climbed everything and had simply never descended. Jory explained himself without embellishment. He saw the moment the word hermit tried to enter Rob’s ear and found it already occupied by a lifetime of uses for land. He saw Rob look past him at the hill, and then down at the Yard where a boy was oiling a chain as if remembering his hands. “You want the old thing up there with the swallows,” Rob said. “It’s not safe in a storm. By which I mean you will be safe and you will not be happy. It’s mine,” he added, not as a warning but as a fact that had centuries under it. “It was my grandmother’s father’s. It wasn’t his. It was the moor’s and the moor let us pretend.”

Jory said he would fix what could be fixed with care. He said he did not want to bring cement; he wanted to bring a broom and a tarpaulin and a pan. Rob watched him for longer than comfort required and then nodded once, as if he had just made a calculation about the weight of a man compared to the weight of a roof. “You can go up,” he said. “You can sit. You can not light fires when the grass pretends to be water. You can tell me if the birds are confused by you and if they are not, you can stay until the birds change their minds. If the parish comes to me I will say you are a scarecrow of a sort I approve of. If the parish comes with their proper words I will tell them you are helping me with the wall near the ditch and it is true, because you are. You will take a hammer and show me that you understand stones.” He said it with a kindness that wanted to hide under the brim of his cap, and Jory found he liked the man as much for his ambiguity as for his decision.

The wall was the kind that asks to be listened to if you are going to make it speak again. Rob showed him how to find the stones that had a mind to lie down and how to put their neighbours beside them so that all the minds aligned. They worked with that sandy quiet that develops when two people agree not to fill a space because its emptiness is doing a better job. Rob tested him with a few middle-sized rocks, watched his fingers, saw that he did not try to force anything into a place that did not belong, and then nodded to the horizon as if to say we will be fine, here, even if we are not fine, there. When a cloud walked over the field the ground changed colour with such conviction they both became briefly religious. “You’ll be cold,” Rob said as he packed the tools away. “Your mother will tell me when you are too thin. My wife will bring you a pie if I tell her it’s for the boy who is pretending to be a lesson. Don’t make me a liar,” he added, and Jory promised he would not.

The Medal was a week away and the course wore it the way a woman wears a promise she is deliberately taking no notice of. The rough had been cut in a way that left its smell hanging like a fog only golfers notice. The bunkers had edges sharp as opinions, and Daz had been up since the sort of hour you do not tell normal people about rolling the greens with the solemnity of a man ironing the tablecloth for a family event. Jory went out early and late, greedily hoarding the hours when nobody else tried the tee with their chat about shafts and lies. He found himself playing with a peculiar care that did not arise from wanting to win; it arose from wanting to leave his last rounds on those holes with a set of touchable memories. On four he took a line he had always avoided and found he loved the suddenness of seeing the fairway open in front of his ball the way a street will occasionally empty to show you its secret spine. On nine he rapped his putt with just enough stomach to watch it roll into the half of the cup that usually denies him out of spite. He spoke aloud to the wind on thirteen and told it he forgave it for every time it had embarrassed him in front of a man with a new driver and a temper. It reacted by lifting the skirt of his ball on the next hole and dropping it in a place he could not see from where he was. He laughed and took his medicine, which is to say a wedge to an invisible green and the faith that has nothing at all to do with religion.

Nate pretended not to watch him and then came out of the clubhouse with a posture he thought would look like chance. “We’ve booked the time sheet in your favour,” he said, and Jory smiled because if there was a phrase that made you understand why people leave organisations, it was booked the time sheet in your favour. “You know I’ll play,” he said. “I’m not leaving before I’ve done this once more with the right shoes on.” Nate scratched at his neck and tried to deliver a blessing as if it were a professional complaint. “Do what you have to,” he said, “but if you carve your face into rock up there like one of those men who want to be gods, don’t expect me to come up and chip the lichen off when it gets ridiculous.” Daz shouted something from the green about anchorites keeping cats and they all ignored him because if there was one rule at the club it was that you did not encourage Daz when he was experimenting with knowledge.

Morwenna had taken up the business of feeding with the seriousness of a person who had discovered that she could do nothing to stop the world and therefore would insist on the quality of its butter. She baked saffron buns and said casually over the washing up that there were now too many for her and the neighbours and if someone were to come by who thought he could live off oats and air he might place one in his bag on the way out. She found in a drawer a flint the size of a thumbnail that Jory recognised from a childhood story involving his father, a storm and a kettle that had no right to boil. She placed it on the table and did not look at it. “Your father would have gone with you for a week,” she said, which meant she wanted to cry and could not and would not, and he reached over and took her hand and held it until she let her fingers close around his thumb with that fierce gentleness she had and he was a boy again, briefly, with all the promise and none of the origin stories.

Lew came round with the sort of grin a man wears when he has decided to admit he cares and therefore must hide it under insult. He sat on the edge of the chair that wobbled and pretended not to, and asked practical questions in the manner of someone throwing stones into a pond to see if it is shallower than it looks. “Water,” he said. “And where do you go when your stomach remembers you are not a monk. And what do you do when your head starts talking to you and you hate the sound of your own voice. And when, little brother, do you come down.” Jory answered, not like a saint but like a man who had allowed himself to want a small life with very large sky. He told him about Rob’s wall and Rob’s warning and the way the doorway of the ruin had pressed itself against his chest like a promise you don’t want to say aloud. Lew shook his head, but not in disagreement; in admiration for the shape of a stubbornness he recognised because his own was the same shape, bent in a different direction.

Rev. Hendra arrived at the studio one afternoon with a book tied up in kitchen string, because he did not own ribbon and would have been ashamed of himself if he had. He found Jory in a corner too small for a person his size and handed him the parcel with a theatrical solemnity that made Morwenna snort behind him. “The Ancrene Wisse,” he said, as if announcing a ship to a harbour. “It’s for anchoresses, not for you, but you can ignore the bits about not looking at men and the bits about wearing hair shirts. It says sensible things about not letting people steal your time with themselves. It says you can keep a cat, although there is a debate among scholars about whether that was meant for England only.” He looked around the room and lowered his voice as if to ensure the book would not hear him being unorthodox. “And I brought you John O’Donohue as well,” he said. “He is Irish and will say good sentences when you need them. He will not fetch the water for you. You will fetch the water yourself.”

Lena began her ritual the next morning with the apron knot and found that she was kinder to herself at the tap because margin had been promoted to the edge of her day. The cat sat on the counter as if he had been hired to supervise and flicked his tail in time to the kettle’s defeated chorus. She walked to the beach with her hands in her pockets in case she was tempted to pick up the wrong five stones, and the sea was in one of its deliberate moods, laying itself down in sheets as if to show off its folding. She chose stones without romance, a piece of granite like a heel, a chunk of something green she could not name, a disk smooth as advice you do not want, a shard that might have been glass once and had rejoined the family of stones by choosing to forget, and a fifth with a white stripe around its middle that looked like a bandage. She brought them back and put them in the new bowl on the table—a bowl that had not existed the day before because she had made it from the brief strength she had taken from talking about thresholds—and the sight of them together calmed her in the peculiar way only five objects with no purpose can calm you when you have been trying to give purpose to everything for too long.

On Thursday afternoon the street contained them both without effort. Cassia had arranged to see a man in the lane opposite who had a bicycle habit and three children and a schedule like a deck of cards; she did not say this, of course, but the town had a way of telling you what everyone planned without anyone actually telling you. Jory came up the hill with a rope coiled over his shoulder as if he were acting out something from a story and was too embarrassed to make eye contact with the author. Lena was at her doorway with her hands covered in slip, and they looked at each other and saw that they were both in the middle of constructing ceremonies. “I thought of you on the beach,” she said, because it was true, and because she wanted to say something that did not pin him into a story she had written in her head. He nodded and told her about the wall and the way stones listen if you speak to them quietly, and she told him about the knot in the apron and how it had already refused three hours of nonsense from people who should be refusing their own nonsense for once. “I made you something,” she said, and went inside and returned with a cup that did not mind being called a cup and yet had the air of a pot that would be happy with anything small placed inside it, from salt to unwritten sentences. “It’s for tea or for the bits you find in your pockets,” she said. “Or for the old year, if you insist on carrying it.” He took it as if it were not just clay but a vote, and he put his fingers on its rim and felt the slight roughness where she had chosen not to smooth it that last fraction, because a thing with no tooth at all does not remember it came from the earth.

He went up again to the ruin before the light left because he wanted to talk to the doorway when there was still enough day for talk to matter. He carried the broom and the tarpaulin and a small blackened pan, and the rope because he did not know what he might need it for and because every boy in him refused to go somewhere new without a rope. He swept in a way that did not pretend the floor could be as tidy as a kitchen floor; he swept like a man telling a room it had been seen. Swallows wrote algebra above his head and criticised his technique with a professionalism he admired. He set the tarpaulin across the half of the stones where the weather most liked to intrude and weighed it down with four flattish rocks, and then sat with his back to the wall and his knees up in a posture he had invented when he was thirteen and the world had started being louder than him.

From where he sat he could see a long strip of sea between two shoulders of land, and on that strip a single boat that had made the decision to go out when wiser men had not. He thought of the men in the photograph at the club with their grim faces and the way you sometimes have to respect someone who ignores sense because a bigger sense is asking. He took the book Hendra had given him, untied the string, and opened it at random because that is how you use such gifts. “Guard your eyes as your mouth,” said a line in the Ancrene Wisse, “let them not be gluttonous.” He laughed because the moor had already arranged that, and then he turned to O’Donohue and found a sentence that did not ask him to believe in anything but asked him to bless what was there. It was astonishing how much could be blessed when you stopped trying to pronounce it correctly.

When he came down the path in the blue hour the town was making its convertible noises—the clink of plates, the shouts of young people trying to hear themselves into existence, the quiet authority of footsteps of those who had lived so many evenings that they no longer counted them. He passed the church and saw a light in the vestry and imagined Hendra rehearsing to the old pews his jokes about anchorites and cats. He passed the pub and heard Lew’s laugh, which was a cousin to his own but with more bass in it, and he thought about stopping and did not, but the thought itself was a rope thrown into a well, proof that he still wanted the sound of other people in his life while he was busy arranging to hear nothing. He let himself into the flat and put the cup on the table beside the five stones and the flint. The television on the floor looked offended at the competition and he told it in his head that it had done nothing wrong, it was only that the shape of his day no longer accommodated its sound.

On Friday a small thing happened that would have embarrassed him if he had been the sort of person embarrassed by small things. Mab from the bar left a note under his door with a smiley face drawn that had somehow managed to look respectful. It said that since he was about to be holy, could he have a look at the ice machine, because only a saint could make it stop coughing, and if he did she would feed him for a week in the language of pies. He carried his screwdriver to the pub and opened the back panel and found a fan choked with the lint of years, and he cleaned it until it spun like an idea in a young head. Mab kissed his cheek heavy with the taste of barley and promised him a fish pie that would make his ancestors weep, and he went back to the flat feeling stupidly useful in the way that makes old men whistle when no one is around.

Saturday he went to the ruin with a small blue enamel jug his mother had produced from a cupboard with the expression of a conjuror considering whether to let the audience know where the rabbit has been. He set it on the stone shelf that would be a table and said aloud, because he had to practice saying things aloud if he was going to be any good at listening, that he would begin after the Medal and the day after he would be here in earnest. He said he would come down for bread and for his mother’s face. He said he would not pretend he did not like the market’s noise. He promised the wall he would carry his share of it. He made a note on a scrap, which he put under a stone, because he liked the idea of the moor keeping an eye on his intentions like a registrar in a very old church. When he stood, a lark let loose from the grass right beside him as if he had trodden on its cloak, and he put his hand to his heart and laughed at himself because the lark had been there all along, and he had not known how close he was to song.

By the time the Medal day came the town had made its arrangements around the story of the hermit without admitting it had done any such thing. Daz, who had been reading again, informed the early bar that anchorites had funeral rites said over them when they were walled up, as if they were dead to the world, and he suggested buying Jory a cake with candles and singing in the car park. Mab told him gently that if he tried such a thing she would take the pint out of his hand and replace it with milk. Nate practised a speech in his bathroom about life choices and loyalty to clubs and the dignity of playing to your strengths, and he forgot the speech as soon as he saw Jory on the first tee with a face like weathered wood. Morwenna put two buns in a bag and tied them with her knitting wool because she could not find string and she could not bring herself to hand him food unadorned when he was about to do something that sounded like a myth. Lena pressed her palms into a piece of clay and felt the tug of the street without the need to look out of the window, the way you can tell when a bird has landed on the roof by the change in the sound of the rain.

Jory stood on the first tee with the wind not yet decided which version of itself to be. He knew half the men watching and half of them had told his story back to him in a way that would have made him angry a year ago and now made him only quiet. He placed the ball on the tee and saw in its equator a thin white line like the one on the stone in his bowl, and he took back the club and brought it through and for a second there was only that clean articulate contact which is the language golf was born to speak and almost never gets right. The ball went out with a certainty that was not bravado, landed where he had asked it to land, and he was left with the annoyance of having to live up to his own start. He laughed with himself because nobody was that person for long. He walked down the fairway with his bag settled on his shoulders like a well behaved child, and the course turned itself under his feet with the intimacy of a place you have let into your bones.

He did not win, because that would have made the story too neat and he had not asked for neatness. He played well enough to make some men remark that it was a pity, and other men remark that perhaps he was right to go now while his game still had its dignity. He went into the clubhouse and allowed Nate to shake his hand with the grand gravity of a man awarding a contract, and allowed Daz to say something that made no sense about lamps and holes in stones, and allowed Mab to press a paper bag into his hand with a warning not to open it until he was alone because she had written swears all over the note inside. He stood under the photograph of the 1963 team and felt their loyalty to the pointless and the beautiful as if it were a button under his heart he could press when he needed to steady himself.

In the evening he walked home along the harbour with his shoes slung over his shoulder because he had always wanted to be the sort of man who could do that without looking like an advertisement. The tide was turning, because of course it was, and the light did that thing the light does where it forgives the day for its mistakes in a series of gold gestures nobody quite deserves. He looked up his street and saw Lena standing at her window, and she lifted her fingers in a tiny salute and he returned it. The television on the floor was still a sulking animal and he thought perhaps he would find someone who needed it more and give it a better room. He put the bag from Mab on his table and untied the wool and read the note full of invented profanity that made him laugh until he leaned on his hands. He ate a bun, and then he stood in the middle of the room with his eyes closed and spoke not to God and not to the moor and not to the town but to the part of himself that was both smaller and bigger than any of those, and he said that he would go, and he said that he would come back, and he said that he would try not to make a holy mess of other people’s stories while he was untangling his own. The last of the evening went out of the window, and the room was not darker for it, because the dark brings its own kind of sight if you are careful with your feet.Chapter Four

The first morning he woke in the ruin, the light arrived as if it had had to think about it on the way. He had slept in the narrow, rolled world of his bag with the tarpaulin slung low enough to persuade the weather to behave, and his back had discovered a stone with opinions about vertebrae that he would need to relocate. The swallows had accepted him with the lofty indifference of tenants who have seen worse landlords; they scribbled in the rafters-that-were-not-rafters and clicked at invisible insects as if they were counting. He lay still and listened to the grammar of the place assemble itself—the soft push of grass against grass, the occasional conversational cough of a sheep, the far involuntary clatter of a tractor that had woken before its driver. His breath made a little fog that lifted and became nobody’s business. He said good morning so quietly he could deny it later.

He had decided before he came that he would give the new life a shape that did not look like punishment. He had seen men punish themselves with plans. They became fastidious, as if pain were a polish they could apply to their days. He wanted his rituals to be things with handles. He swept the floor without trying to turn the ruin into a kitchen. He boiled water on the little stove with the seriousness of a man performing a baptism and drank his tea from Lena’s cup, which made the heat feel like it had been earned by hands, not by machinery. He ate a heel of bread from Morwenna’s bag and a saffron bun he pretended he had not meant to bring. He did not open his books until after he had been out and touched the stones of the wall with his fingers, saying to each one without saying it aloud: you go there if you want and not if you don’t.

He placed on the lintel five objects to acknowledge that he had started. The blue enamel jug because it had been his mother’s mother’s and therefore had the authority of other breakfasts; the flint because his father had once lit a fire in weather that had confiscated flame from the county; the notebook with its cheap blue cover because he distrusted anything that announced itself as a journal; the white-banded stone from the beach because it reminded him that even rocks can accept decoration; and a small pencil that had worked through so many scorecards its lead had become a veteran. He thought about the first tee on a tournament morning and felt a ribbon of love for the boy he had been who thought the world was a series of shots done right. He wrote in the notebook a vow so unshowy he could put it on a scrap and hide it under any stone: three months, listen, return.

By the second day he had discovered the sound the tarpaulin made that meant more wind than he liked was on the moor. It was not the flapping bravado people mimic when they talk about camping; it was an edge-noise, a tight, critical little tremor in the cord that meant a gust would put its shoulder into the wall and ask rude questions. He learned the smell of the air that came before the fog and the smell that came after, and he practised paying attention to the ways his own body told him the weather had moved on. He would be reading Hendra’s book about anchoresses and find that he had turned two pages without seeing a word because the temperature on his forearms had changed. Every time he noticed a detail like that and did not turn it into an anecdote, he felt he had earned an extra hour of quiet.

The first person who found him did not mean to. Two tourists with matching jackets the colour of peacocks came up the path at an hour that made no sense for the town and appeared at the doorway with expressions like contraband. The woman had a map folded into a shape so intricate it could have gone to a museum; the man had the slightly satisfied panic of someone about to discover that his guesswork had been a mistake. Jory stood because it felt wrong to introduce himself to strangers while sitting on the floor like a cat. The woman smiled with a sort of apology. “We were told not to go too far because of the fog and we went too far,” she said, and the man added, as if to demonstrate the fog’s character, “It’s like a person, isn’t it.” Jory showed them the track that the locals called a path and the map refused to recognise, pointing out where to keep the wall on their left and the cliff on their absent minds. They asked if he lived there and he said yes because he could not think of a more accurate verb. They did not ask the word hermit. They said thank you with the gratitude of people who have seen the edges of something and are happy not to be responsible for its story. When they were far enough away he felt a tug of allegiance he had not planned for. He had not come to be a window, and yet a window is what a door looks like if you stand too far back. He wrote in the notebook: emergency is not the same as conversation. He put a piece of blue rope on a nail inside the doorway and decided that if it hung down two knots it meant he would answer. If it hung down one, he would pretend to be a ruin.

His body found its own times. He woke with the swallows when they flew a particular loop, the one with the sharp turn near the corner that meant breakfast. He ate when the light outside the doorway became the colour of bread hot from an oven, not when a clock insisted. He read until the first shadow reached the jug and then he stood because a small line of shade told him it was time to move his spine. He went down to Rob’s wall every afternoon because there is only so much nobility a man can wring from sitting still and he liked the language his hands had learned there—humility and weight, weight and humility. Rob watched him work without interfering and sometimes said a sentence that was really three hours of observation boiled down. “Don’t argue with the thin ones,” he said one day, “they have more backbone than you think.” Another day he said, “We call that a bishop,” pointing to a particular shape, “not because it’s holy but because if you put it in the wrong place it interferes with everything.”

At the end of one of those afternoons Rob’s wife, Tamsin, came out carrying a plate with a pie on it the size of a small tragedy. She had eyes that took a photograph of you and filed it somewhere between pity and amusement, and a plait like rope. “You’re the one pretending to be silence,” she said, and he liked her at once because she did not ask for an explanation. “Rob says you listen to the stones before you move them. Good. We do not need the kind of man who puts his mind in front of everything.” She placed the pie in his hands and he accepted the weight as if he were being given one of the heavier responsibilities of the parish. “Mind the fox,” she said, and when he looked down at the yard as if a fox would obligingly present itself for his education, she added, “He walks the top of the wall four fields up just before dusk and believes himself invisible. He’s not. Don’t tell him.”

The fox became a small appointment in his day that he did not tell anyone about. It loitered at the edge of his eye like a thought you are not ready to write down. He began to see how many lives ran along the same lines he walked without ever crossing. A wren took to using the broken window as if she had paid rent, and he altered the way he set the tarpaulin so that she had a clear flight in, because it seemed ungracious to make your first neighbour move house for you. He stopped cleaning the black soot off the pan as if a better man might be arriving to inspect it and let it carry the story of fires across its face like a small weather report. He adopted, without making decisions about it, a practice of placing a pebble in his mouth when he felt his head ticking with words he did not need to say; it was a child’s trick and an old monk’s trick and it worked because it did not look like a trick at all to anyone watching from the grasses.

What surprised him most was the way hunger made his day feel more like his body. In town hunger was a nuisance that made you stand up from a chair and interrupt a sentence. In the hut—he allowed himself that word, liking the way it softened the ruin’s insistence on its own ruin—hunger arrived like a bell. It told him when to stir the oats and when to walk down and see his mother and accept whatever she placed in his hands without saying you shouldn’t have because she was going to anyway. Morwenna took to handing him parcels wrapped in tea towels with the air of a woman conducting a smuggling operation that could not be proved. She never asked the question she wanted to ask because she knew how to save a boy from not knowing the answer. She told him stories about his father as if she had only just remembered them, the way people do when the person who will recognise the stories is near enough to make the remembering worth it. One evening she recounted a day when his father had rowed his boat into a fog so thick you could have mistaken it for an insult and had navigated home by listening for the exact pitch of a bell that only tolled on damp Sundays. “He was arrogant with the sea until the day it told him to stop,” she said, and then she washed the spoon as if it had said something impolite and needed to be brought back into line.

Lena’s studio began to keep better hours because she had given it a plan that refused to act like a plan. The apron knot settled into her fingers and made her feel briefly like someone who had inherited something sensible. She found that tying the second knot made the act of seeing into an action, which got round her worst habit of thinking seeing and making were the same thing. Cassia’s three tasks for the week had made a quiet furniture of her mornings. She took the stones to the window with her water and understood with a degree of embarrassment that she had been lonely for objects that did not ask her to improve them. She cleaned the sink as if it were visiting and found that what the sink wanted most was to be left to be clean. She wrote her no on a small square and pinned it under margin, and the act of doing it made her laugh and then cry because it was such a little word and she had been so hungry for it.

The no turned out to have a job within twenty-four hours. A woman from a craft fair at the rugby club telephoned and said there was a last-minute table going and one of the committee had seen her bowls at the deli and it would be good exposure. Exposure was the word that brought on a rash. She almost said yes because the apron knot was not yet strong enough to hold an entire rugby club, and then she heard Cassia’s voice in her head sounding like the tide as it makes the beach speak—say no to two small yeses to keep one large yes warm. She said she could not, and watched the disappointment arrive on the end of the line like a small storm and then move away without damage. She took down a large sheet of paper and wrote in pencil a list of ridiculous bowls she would attempt instead. She put at the top a bowl the size of a child’s tent, shaped like the inside of a listening ear. Halfway down she wrote bowl with handle you cannot hold. At the very bottom she wrote bowl for words you did not use, and underlined it twice because she knew she would need that one even if she never showed it to anyone.

It was Cassia who suggested she find a larger room for the first of the ridiculous bowls before she pretended to begin. “You can start the coil here,” she said, tapping the table with the edge of her palm, “but you will end by swearing at the ceiling and you don’t need that kind of quarrel.” Lena thought of the barn behind Rob’s place and remembered a day when she had taken photographs there for a poster and everything had looked as if it had been made by hands and weather. She walked up in the heat of an afternoon and found Tamsin in the yard with a bucket as if buckets were a moral position. She explained what she wanted and waited for laughter, and Tamsin did laugh but it had affection in it, not noise. “You want to build a room for listening inside a room we use for hay,” she said. “All right, bring a broom and a truth about how much space you will actually use. Rob says you can move the bikes if you lift rather than drag. You city people always drag.” “I’m from Bristol,” Lena said. “Same church,” Tamsin said, and led her to the barn.

They set a table with trestles and carried in an old door for a surface that could take an accident. The barn had a way of holding light the way some faces hold kindness around the eyes. Dust rose when she swept and made a congregation of its own in the high air. She thought of Cassia’s word for what she did—architecture—and did not resent it. It was, perhaps, a mercy sometimes to be given the name for a room before you have the courage to step into it. She pinched the first coil with a steadier hand than she had expected to find and set it down with the patience of someone laying a road.

Jory came upon her there without surprise because Tamsin had told him the world had moved in. He stood at the doorway and watched the first layer take on its slow spiral. Something in him wanted to mark the moment with a sentence that would sound like philosophy and end up sounding like a man trying to make a woman more metaphysical than she needed to be. He said instead the true thing that had come to his tongue. “That’s a fine start.” She looked up with clay wet to the heel of her hand and grinned because paying attention to beginnings is a rare kindness. They spoke without crowding the air. She told him about saying no to the rugby club and he shook his head with admiration because a rugby club is a force of nature. He told her about the couple with the peacock jackets and she asked without mockery whether he had been tempted to tell them that quiet was not a landmark they could tick off. He admitted he had been tempted; he admitted he had felt a prickly joy that they had found him anyway.

In town Cassia’s small weather continued, as advertised, to change lungs. The man with the bicycles began to keep his appointment with himself called sitting, and his children found him on the floor surrounded by toy animals arranged according to species and trust levels and decided their father had become interesting. Mab started closing the bar for an hour on Wednesdays to walk round Porthmeor and pick up litter with a pair of tongs she bought at the hardware shop with a level of ceremony that made the tongs blush. Rev. Hendra met Cassia in the greengrocer and they stood between the leeks and the oranges talking about vows as if they were recipes anyone could try if they had the right tin. He said he had always been suspicious of promises that needed to be witnessed by a quorum; she said the best vows were made to the person you’d be when you woke up on a Tuesday in rain. He left with his head tilted and an extra bunch of parsley, which he would pretend had been the plan all along.

Morwenna saw Cassia in the bakery and performed, with minimal theatrics, the old Cornish art of testing a stranger by watching the way they handled pastry. Cassia took a saffron bun as if each raisin were a small eye and said she had never tasted anything so yellow, and Morwenna decided to like her despite the scarf. They stood under the little bell and spoke about nothing until they were both speaking about something. Morwenna, who rarely confessed, confessed she had lost one son once for two days when he was six because he had decided to live behind the compost heap to see what living felt like when you were not being watched. Cassia did not say anything wise. She said that there is a point at which a mother stands in a room and asks the air to carry her words, and sometimes it listens. Morwenna nodded and wrapped a sticky bun as if it might speak later when the scarf-woman was tired, and put it in the bag with more authority than was strictly necessary.

It was a storm from the southwest that brought the first argument. The farmers had felt it in their teeth an afternoon before the forecast agreed and the gulls had performed their small committee function on the harbour wall, facing into it with the solemnity of a jury. The wind came over the ruin and found the tarpaulin and made an enemy of it in three minutes. Jory had been waiting for the first real test with the nervousness of a man waiting for the first fight in a marriage. He pulled the rope tighter and the knot, which last week had seemed like engineering, became suddenly childish. He lay on the floor with his boots against the base of the far wall and his hands on the rope like a sailor in a story for boys, and he watched the tarpaulin try to peel itself off the stones and take his dignity with it. Water found its old paths and reminded him who had trained whom. He told the doorway, between his teeth, that he was staying. He told the wind that he had known worse tempers in clubhouses. He told himself to stop speaking in case the swallows heard him and made literature of it.

In the middle of the night, which is the time storms use to test your civility, the rope slipped and the tarpaulin flapped with such malicious clarity that he laughed because he had no better weapon. He stood, and the wind knocked the laugh out of his mouth, and he reset the sheet with his head bent to the rain because there is a way to bow that is not surrender. When the dawn arrived like a scruffy messenger with mud on its knees, the ruin looked like a dog after a swim. Jory was soaked and cold and unaccountably happy because he had not been taken. He made tea with hands that did not appear to belong to him and sipped it and watched a wren try to reconstruct a nest that had very obviously been designed with a sunnier forecast in mind. “We’ll do better,” he told her, and she made a noise like laughter through a beak full of grass.

After the storm, people found reasons to see if he had blown away. Daz appeared with the air of a man who had not been sleeping anyway and carried a book about saints that had spent its previous life in a damp box in a boot. “There’s a person in here named Piran,” he said proudly, “and he came from Ireland and invented tin or carried a stone or something. Cornishmen love him because he’s not too fancy. You could be like Piran. Or like that other one who sat on a pillar for a long time just to be difficult.” Jory took the book and promised to become no one whose statue required scaffolding. Nate stood on the track in shoes not designed for tracks and said nothing for the longest time, which counted as tenderness. He said eventually, “You look like you’ve crawled through weather,” and Jory nodded because there are days when that is the compliment you hope lands. Nate looked at the doorway and the tarpaulin and the rope and the jug and said, “I’ll leave you to it,” and Jory wanted to hug him for the absence of advice but settled on tilting his head.

On a Sunday that forgot to be busy, Lena and Cassia and six other people who had not, until that minute, ever been in a group together stood on Porthmeor at dawn and pretended the word ritual was a normal word. Cassia had not asked for incense or chanting. She had brought a packet of cheap ribbons cut into narrow bands and a thermos that achieved divinity by being exactly the right temperature for the length of their standing. They wrote on the ribbons with a laundry marker, not their ambitions or their failures but the disciplines they were willing to practice for a month—drink water sitting down, speak kindly to the part of me that knocks things over, go to bed without the little screen twice a week, send a letter to the elderly aunt who is not annoying but simply old. They tied the ribbons to the ugly railing by the steps where nobody would look unless they had put a ribbon there. The wind learned their names and lifted them as if reading, and the sea came as close as it could without becoming involved. Lena wrote stay at the wheel for an extra ten minutes when it scares you and felt the fear blush when she tied it to the rust.

She went up to the barn after and the bowl had kept its shape while she was gone because clay is not loyal to anyone and she was relieved. She added three coils and stopped because there is such a thing as ending where the day wants and not where your ambition made a circle. She washed her hands with the hose and found the water had the cleanest smell in the parish, because it ran over granite before it ran over anything man had invented. Tamsin came into the barn carrying a tin with biscuits in it and watched the outline of the bowl take on the curve it would keep. “If it collapses you will be angrier than you believe you can be at matter,” she said, and Lena nodded because her worst quarrels were always with things that refused to be what she had decided on their behalf. “It will be a handsome collapse,” Tamsin added, which was as kind as religion.

That week, small messages arrived without addresses. Someone left a bundle of kindling under the lintel of the ruin with the quiet competence of a person raised by weather. A white feather stuck itself to the edge of Lena’s worktable and refused to blow away even when it should have, and she put it in the bowl with the five stones because she liked the way it broke the shape. Rev. Hendra found on the step of the church a screw he had been missing for months and thanked someone out loud even though he knew it had been his own pocket. Morwenna received a postcard with a photograph of a lighthouse from a woman she had not spoken to since their husbands were alive, and the image of that stern white column made her laugh because it had not moved and she had, and the lighthouse could hold whatever it liked against that.

Jory started a catalogue of noises. He did not tell himself it was a poem; he would have had to stop. He wrote down the way the rope spoke when it had been in the rain for two days, a sort of salted creak. He wrote the little cough the stove made when the first flame accepted its job. He wrote the sound of a far engine that might have been a tractor or might have been a man in an empty hall dragging a chair. He wrote the three-note call of the wagtail that came like a question and then its own answer. He wrote the silence between the gusts when the moor held its breath and the quiet was larger than anywhere he had ever been. He wrote down, one evening, the sound a man makes when he is missing nobody in particular but he is missing. He did not describe it; he just put a line there without words and looked at it and let it do the work.

He began to dream better. On the fourth night he dreamed he was back on the eighth green and the world had tilted and the hole had rolled like a coin to the top of a hill and stuck there and he had had to putt uphill to a target that refused his reason. He woke and laughed because that was as honest a description of leaving as he had managed so far to make. On the seventh night he dreamed of his father in a boat without oars and the oars were held out by gulls like waiters. He woke and ate a bit of pie and said into the dark that he forgave his father for having had a good time without him on certain days. The dark did not applaud or scold. It sat beside him like an old friend who knows the right thing to do is let you hear your own voice and then ask if there is any more pie.

When the first tourists of the week appeared at the ruin again, it was a family with a boy the age of kneecaps and a mother wearing a hat that declared a campaign against freckles. The boy came to the doorway and looked at Jory with the curiosity that belongs to people who haven’t yet learned to disguise it. “Are you a wizard,” he asked, and the mother started to explain apologetically that wizards do not sit on floors with pans, but Jory said very seriously that he was not a wizard because wizards have responsibilities he did not feel up to. The boy accepted this, as children accept very serious news, and then said in a lighter voice: “I see your house has a big window with no glass.” Jory smiled because it was one of the better descriptions he had heard. When they left the boy put a small plastic soldier down next to the jug and for a second Jory nearly removed it because he did not want to make his shelf into a museum. He left it. There is no sense in pretending the world does not arrive with toys.

He went down into town for bread and salt and came out of the grocer’s into a day that had chosen light the way some days choose thunder. On the noticeboard by the harbour there was a flyer with a proper font about the lifeboat fundraiser, all sausage rolls and bravery, and he smiled because there was not a person in town who did not know in some portion of their blood what the lifeboat had cost and saved. He saw, three notices over, a card on cream paper with a gold stamp and without meaning to he reached for it. The name was there, and the number that remembered its rhythm. He put the card back because it did not belong to him and then took it again because he liked the way the morning looked when he considered it. He did not telephone. He pocketed the rhythm and walked up the hill and found on his doorstep a sprig of gorse tied with green thread. He untied it and set the thorns where the light caught them and decided that sometimes it is useful to be prickled by a gift.

That evening he sat just outside the doorway with his feet in the grass and the ruin behind him like a back he trusted. The fox performed its catwalk on the wall at the agreed time and looked straight at him in the way wild animals do when they are practising being gods. He saluted it with two fingers. Down on the road he could have sworn he heard Lew’s laugh drop into the quiet and bounce twice like a pebble in a river. He thought about going down and did not. He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth to stop a sentence he did not need to begin and found he liked the flavour of it. He had expected to miss golf in a way that left a bruise on his mornings. Instead he missed crowds, occasionally, in a way that reminded him that he was not built to live without witnesses for very long. He understood then that the listening would have to include the town if it were to be honest. No good building a silence that required pretending people were not there.

He stood and walked to the little shelf and put his hand on the jug and then on the stone with the white band. He took the pencil and wrote on a page three things he would do in the week that would feel, to anyone watching, like treachery to his plan and would, to him, feel like fidelity to something older. He would take the pie tin back to Tamsin and stand long enough to hear about her sister’s knees. He would go to the fundraiser for the lifeboat and eat a sausage roll and stand beside Lew without shaping his mouth into explanations. He would knock on Morwenna’s door and not make a joke and simply ask if she wanted him to mend the shelf that had never managed to hold jars properly since 1999. He would do these because choosing to be unseen did not require him to be invisible.

The moon grew up out of the horizon the way some faces rise from the crowd and you realise they have been there the whole time, waiting for your gaze. He leaned his shoulders back into the stone and felt the creak of his muscles and the rest of his bones’ slow applause for his day. He said the small sentence, the pebble he had found before and the one that had not worn smooth yet. He said, I will go. He added, I will return, because it seemed wise to remind the moor that he did not plan to belong to it forever. He said, keep the doorway. The air did not say no. It moved over his hair and played with it the way Lena sometimes played with a coil to see if it would hold, and then it went on to the next field because it had a schedule to keep and he was only one man in a ruin with a pan.Chapter Six

The morning of the fundraiser began with the harbour pretending to be patient. Men in jackets that had outlived two jobs moved trestle tables like chess pieces, and the smell of frying declared itself more convincingly than any poster. Bunting went up along the railing in a series of decisions that offended nobody, and the tide sat as if it had been asked to keep an eye on things. Jory came down from the ruin with his hands empty on purpose. He had decided, in the notebook where he did not use the word vow because he was saving it for when he needed it, that today he would stand where people could count him without counting on him. He had slept lightly because the wind had kept changing its mind, and he felt the small delicious ache a day of lifting stones leaves in a person. He put his palm on the harbour wall as if checking the pulse of an old friend and felt in the granite a cool discipline he admired.

Morwenna had set up near the door of the hall with a tray of buns and a face that suggested that if you did not buy one she would know where to find you. She wore her cardigan as if it were armour and had tied her hair back in a way that made her look like she had refused to age for an hour as a favour to the event. When she saw Jory she lifted a bun the size of a fist and did not smile because smiling was reserved for after money had exchanged hands. He gave her a coin and then another because he had never been good at buying only one of something from his mother, and she put the coins into the cash tin and for a second both of them were thinking, foolishly, of a jam jar on a windowsill when he was small and every coin had gone into the gull’s tin because the gull had looked at him with such authority on the picture.

Lew came from nowhere with a noise on his breath that belonged to beer two hours from now and gave Jory a clap on the shoulder that moved him along the pavement. “They’re doing a demonstration,” he said, nodding at the lifeboat as if it were a cousin who had gotten famous. “If the sea behaves. If the sea can be persuaded to be the sort of lady who goes to demonstrations for charity.” He had shaved and he had missed a line on his neck, which made him look briefly like their father and then like a man who was not going to try that hard to be anyone else’s version of smart. “You look well,” he added, grudging and fond. “Too thin. Mam’s feeding anyone who looks at her. She needs a better door.” Jory looked toward the lifeboat house and felt a small bright thread move behind his ribs. He had brought no speech for the moment; he had brought only his body, which would have to do.

Mab presided over the beer shed like a queen who had stolen her own crown and was seeing how long she could wear it before someone noticed. She had acquired a high-vis vest because the committee liked high-vis vests, and she wore it with irony so gentle it might have been a kindness. “You,” she said to Jory, handing him a plastic cup of lemonade because she had appointed herself in charge of his sobriety without telling him, “can be the man who opens the ice machine when it sulks. I have Channel Four weather on the inside of that box and I am not ashamed to say it.” He laughed and promised to have a look later and watched her move through the bodies with the easy competence of someone who had stayed up all her life long enough to see the last person go home.

Cassia appeared with the ribbon still in her pocket from the dawn and a jumper the colour of a hillside thinking about heather. She had come because the town had asked her without anyone using the words and because she liked watching communities show their bones. She did not push through the crowd; she let the crowd absorb her and then step back, the way a tide will occasionally let your ankles breathe. She saw Lena at the edge of the tables with clay still clement on her fingernails and went to her as if to a door she liked. “I came early,” she said, “because I am practicing being the sort of person who leaves before she is tired.” Lena nodded and tucked hair behind her ear in the gesture that meant she was proud of herself and pretending not to be. “The bowl is holding,” she reported, which was the kind of news that deserved a radio announcer and received only the smile of a friend. “I had a little collapse in the corner where I thought I was clever. It was handsome, like Tamsin promised. I mended it before it learned any habits.”

They stood together and watched Jory without saying his name. He had taken a place near the slipway beside the man who ran the chandlery and had the expressions of a person who likes ropes too much. He was not hiding; he was not presenting himself. He was at the angle in the room where you can see but nobody asks you to perform. Cassia liked him there. She had met men who went away to be listened to by themselves and found the mirror hungry. He had gone away with the unglamorous hope of hearing. There are occupations, she thought, that look like flight and are faithful as anchors.

In the middle of the morning a man with a camera found him. It was a sensible camera slung on a not sensible strap, and the man had the complexion of someone who had been waiting for cloud all day and was smug about getting it. “You’re the hermit,” he said, as if reading out a raffle prize. “I’m doing a piece for the Sunday supplement. The Cornish Turn Away. An Ancient Practice in a Modern Age. We’ll do a shot of you with the boat behind, looking resolute.” He had a notebook poised and a pen with a clip that had fallen off and wounded the cap. Jory did not sigh, because sighing gives away too much. He tilted his head in the way that made people believe he might say yes if they were patient. “I’m not really the hermit,” he said. “I’m a man who lives on a hill for a bit. The hill is more photogenic.” The man seemed nonplussed by the refusal to be distilled. “I could call you an anchorite,” he tried, and Daz materialised with the speed of a man halfway through a pub quiz. “Anchorites had windows for the food,” Daz said helpfully. “And cats.” “Do you have a cat,” the man asked, triumphant, and Jory said, “I am adjacent to a wren,” and the man’s pen made a bad line in the notebook. Cassia, who had watched the exchange with that soft intent that does not insist on being useful, stepped up as if she had been late to a rehearsal. “He’s promised his quiet to himself for three months,” she said, as if it were a legal arrangement the camera would have to respect. “If you write about him now, you’ll ruin your own story. Come back at the end when it’s almost a myth and the hill will have had time to decide if it wants to be in your photograph.” The man, who was not a monster, blinked as if someone had told him to put his hat back on and remember whose house this was. He looked at Cassia with a frown that had manners in it, and then he turned and photographed the bunting because bunting never asked for anything and always showed up.

“You didn’t have to,” Jory said, once the man was absorbed into a group of teenagers who believed cameras worked by wizardry. “I don’t like windows,” he added, and Cassia smiled because the sentence had the shape she liked. “I measured for a door,” she said, and then she nodded and was gone because she had made a note in her own pocket about leaving before she was tired.

By noon the town was in that state communities achieve when they are pleased to be seen by themselves. Nate was telling a story beside a tray of sausages and using his hands as if the meat had personally wronged him and needed explaining to, and the old men by the railing were correcting the weather with the confidence of farmers, and the children had formed two factions at war over whether gulls could be bribed. Rev. Hendra stood with his collar slightly askew because he had been lifting chairs against his better judgement and was talking to a woman with a baby about christenings as if they were small parties for water. He did not sermonise; he named the boats like saints under his breath and let the names do the work. Tamsin came down with a pie balanced like a sacrament and told a teenage boy more eyeliner than experience to take a plate to his mother whether she wanted it or not, and he did because Tamsin ordered only in the imperative when love was involved.

The lifeboat crew did the demonstration with the efficient showmanship of people who would rather not have audiences for what they are best at. They donned their gear in a way that looked slow and was not, and they walked to the boat in pairs because someone had worked out that bodies move better in pairs when it matters. The shout was simulated and the boat slid on its rails with the dignified rattle of a machine that had been oiled by and for love. Children squealed. Lew was silent, because even a demonstration reminded him of the day he had waited on the quay for news about a man whose first name he had said and whose last name he had forgotten because the sea had taken it. He watched the boat lift as if to sniff the wind and then commit itself to the water as if remembering lanes in a pool, and he folded his arms over his chest in a way that made him look big and then small.

They had just lifted the cups for a cheer when the call came. It was not loud. It was a series of things that happened in quick right order. A phone in a pocket vibrated without apology. A man’s face changed as if a cupboard had been opened behind his eyes. The crew looked at each other the way men do when the joke has become the truth. Somebody said quietly, “Out beyond Pendeen,” and somebody else said, “Kayakers,” and the demonstration turned, invisibly, into its parent. The second launch carried no ceremony. The boat went back down with a speed that came from practice and not from panic, and the crowd, whose job at last was to stand and be a crowd, did it without instruction. Hendra took off his jacket and rolled his sleeves as if he might be asked to count anything and wanted to be ready. Mab, who had been in the middle of a complicated exchange with three pints and a Shandy, passed the drinks to three strangers and said “hold these,” and the strangers did, and she went to the edge of the slip and watched like someone taking attendance.

Jory felt his chest become two rooms—one with the harbour in it, one with the horizon. He did not move, because moving would have been play-acting. He watched the boat become smaller with that sickening competence small things have when they are going to do something you will never fully know. He thought of his white-banded stone and of the bowl in the barn that was all curve and patience, and he pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth again to avoid turning any of it into a sentence. Lew moved close to him, not because he needed him, but because brothers do not like to be at the same event in different corners. “We are useless now,” Lew said, not self-pitying, stating it like the weather. “Yes,” Jory said, and their agreement was the only useful thing for the length of a cup of tea.

Time passes differently when you wait for a boat. It elongates in one place and hurries in another like a tide miscalculating its own coast. Daz, who was the sort of man who could not keep his hands still when his mind wanted to run, began to dismantle and reassemble the bunting on his own and then put it back better. The teenagers went quiet and then noisy and then quiet in the erratic way of sparrows when a hawk is two minutes out of the sky. Somebody began to stack plates as if each one had a job and might get told off. Cassia had taken up a post beside Lena and was watching the colour of the people. “We stand, and this is a ritual,” she said in a voice no one could hear but the air. “We count without counting. We make the same promises under our breath and spend them later.” Lena’s hands, which had accepted clay all morning, felt suddenly stupid and she put them flat on the splintered table so the day could read her palm. “If the bowl falls,” she said, “I will pretend it was a question.” Cassia nodded. “And if it holds, you will pretend it wasn’t an answer.”

The boat took longer than anyone liked, which is to say it took exactly as long as it had to. Somebody had a radio in a pocket and then pretended they did not, and then everybody knew because you can feel a message when it arrives even if it does not speak your language. The sea in the distance was indifferent. The sea at the harbour steps was busy with small courtesies. Morwenna came out from behind her table and stood in front of it and watched with her whole face. She did not pray because she had spent enough time in rooms with sick men to know that praying loudly is often a way to hear your own good intentions. She did speak quietly to the water in the tone mothers use to children running too near a road. “Mind them,” she said, and the water did not nod, but if it had, Morwenna would have forgiven it for hedging.

When the boat came back there were three people on it who had not meant to be on boats that day. One was hunched in the posture people take when their bodies want to apologise for the weather. One had a hat that had become a creature and now wanted a name. One had no hat and hair plastered to their skull like a warning. The crowd did what crowds do when they are allowed to breathe again. They made a sound that was more like a body than a noise. The crew moved without theatre, which was the grace available to them. The kayaks were stacked in the boat like animals who had been taught a lesson. The boat nudged the slipway like a dog asking to be dried off. Hendra lifted his hands without thinking and made a space in the air where thanks might sit, and left it there, uncollected.

Lew let his breath out in a way that made him a different shape. Jory put his hand against the railing and did not move for another minute because he was not ready to be less still. The returning men stepped onto concrete and became ordinary at once with the magic you want for them. A woman cried in relief and then laughed in that odd staccato of dings that relief rings from you. Mab handed a pint to a man who had expected gin and nobody minded. A gull made off with half a sausage and was called names with a sincerity that suggested love. The old men amended their forecast with dignity. The crowd found its feet and its chatter and its rubbish and its recollection of who had owed whom a pound for a raffle.

“You came,” Nate said to Jory, in the tone of a man surprised by a good deed from an enemy. “I said I would,” Jory said, and it was unarguable, which is how he preferred his sentences lately. Nate watched him for a second as if he might be about to admit that he had missed him on the eighth green and then thought better of it. “We want a volunteers’ barbecue next Friday,” he said instead, as if information could disguise affection. “Not to recruit you,” he added, because he had remembered too late who he was speaking to. “Just to show off our new tongs.” Jory said he would bring himself and the story about the blue rope because it was the kind of story men tolerate from each other when food is involved. Nate nodded and went away and it counted as an embrace between their kind of men.

When the crowd thinned in the way crowds are engineered to by hunger and tired children and the call of washing machines, Lena and Cassia walked up the hill together because the body likes to move after being piled in a harbour. They did not talk at first. The road had a way of taking conversation and putting it aside for later like a coat. At the corner by the deli Cassia said, “The man with the camera will be back,” and Lena said, “He can take pictures of buns,” and Cassia laughed with a care that said she knew what it was to be found by someone else’s headline. “You’re making a vessel that will hold a room,” Cassia said. “He is making a frame for a story. Both are dangerous if you think they are the thing.” Lena thought of her bowl with its handsome mended corner. “I am not a bowl,” she said, feeling foolish and relieved. “No,” Cassia said, “and he is not a camera. If we must give each other metaphors, we should at least let them breathe.”

At the farm the barn was cooler than the day expected, and Lena walked into it the way people walk into churches when they are not believers. The bowl did not betray her. It had remembered the shape they had agreed on and not invented any new declarations while she was gone. She put her hand on its side and felt the skin of it, and the clay returned the pressure in a way that made her feel she had chosen, for once, the exact right task. Tamsin knocked the dust off her boots on the threshold as if to keep the field from eavesdropping and peered at the curve with a farmer’s approval. “You were gone for a boat,” she said, not caring that it sounded like a line of poetry. “I was,” Lena said. “We stood.” “Good,” Tamsin said. “We can always do that.”

Up at the ruin Jory set the little blue jug back in its place and put the bun from his pocket beside it. He watched an ant consider the currants and then decide against them, as if it had read the history of sugar and did not approve. He sat on the lintel and took out the pencil with a lead now as weary as a retired miner and wrote, under the heading he refused to call vow: went down, stood, returned. The fox kept its appointment on the wall and flicked his eyes toward the harbour as if he, too, had been counting. The tarpaulin made a sound like something trying to remember its name and then settling. The wren came in with a twig too long and fought with it at the angle in the window until she worked out a trick half acrobat and half stubbornness. He admired her, which is the stage before love in most sensible creatures.

He thought, not for the first time, of a landscape without people and how much worse it would be for the absence. He had wanted to be unseen and instead he found himself being seen by precisely the set of eyes he could bear. He wondered whether that was grace or accident and decided he did not mind which. He stood when the shadow of the lintel reached the jug and walked down to Morwenna’s without the ceremony of sending word ahead. He found her at the sink with her arms up to the elbows in water and a look on her face that meant she was recounting the morning to herself to see if she had left anything behind. He kissed her cheek and picked up a tea towel. “They brought them back,” he said, because one sentence is as good a news as three in some houses. “I know,” she said, and he realised he had never doubted that she would have known before he told her.

Night put its hand flat on the moor and pressed the colours in. In the studio, Lena took the five stones from the bowl and set them in a line and then put them back because they did better work together. She took the feather out and put it into a book and immediately felt faithless and then decided not to be dramatic about loose feathers. On the railing by the stairs, the ribbons shifted as if learning to read the names cooked into them by the laundry marker. Cassia, in her small flat on the other side of the hill, washed her cup and put it on the draining board in such a way that it did not clatter, which was the kind of victory nobody writes down. Nate lay in his bed and practiced the sentence he might say to Jory next time that would not sound like a complaint and might be mistaken for blessing. Daz read three paragraphs about saints and fell asleep with the book on his chest and a look on his face as if a candle had gone out politely. Rob stood at the door of the barn and sniffed the air and told Tamsin it would be dry tomorrow without quite saying the word promise. Hendra went through the church switching off lights and found one still on in the vestry and left it, as if God might be doing some paperwork.

Jory lay on his back in the ruin and put his hand behind his head like a man on a beach trying not to get sun in his eyes. He said the sentence he had made himself like for these evenings because leaving and returning had both now had their proof. He said, I will go; I will come back; keep the doorway. A moth wrote something briefly in front of his face that no one now living knew how to read. The air did not say no. The air, which had more on, went on, and the ruin held him the way a boat holds someone who trusts it enough to lie still. The sea, which he could not see from where his head lay, was nevertheless in the room like a guest who knows where the cups are and will not require waking if it wants tea. He slept, not like a saint and not like a hermit, but like a man who had, for one day at least, got his proportions right.Chapter Seven

He woke to the colour of milk poured thin through the air, a light that had been up before him and had already done a few small jobs, tightening the gloss on the wet grass, setting one sheep onto another piece of hillside as if moving chess. The tarpaulin had dried into quiet; the rope, which the night wind had taught some manners to, lay obediently along the stones with an air of earned sobriety. When he sat and swung his feet to the floor he found, next to the blue jug, a feather that did not belong to his usual visitors. It was larger, a curlew perhaps, and it held in its barbs a pale brown the exact colour of a field just after the hay has been taken. He wondered whether it had blown in during the storm or been laid there by the sort of wind that knows where you keep your best thoughts. He set it against the stone with the white band and watched the two tones not argue, and the sight gave him the peculiar satisfaction that comes when two things that will not be in a sentence together sit happily side by side.

The wren’s nest in the broken window had added a second idea to its architecture. He could see it now, a cupped ambition of grasses and horsehair, tightened at the rim with what looked suspiciously like one of Tamsin’s baler twines unravelled to its smallest honesty. He discovered that if he stood to the left of the doorway and did not let his breath push too far ahead he could hear the breath of the nest itself, a soft, improbable sound as if someone had tucked a secret into the straw and asked it to sleep. It made his skin behave differently; he felt suddenly as if his own lungs were being read by the moor. He smiled because there are days when your chest becomes a set of bellows you are allowed to watch, and the watching changes nothing and everything.

He had not quite got used to the nocturnal life of the ruin, which was not his life so much as a schedule being kept with or without his narrative. Fox feet had left their braille along the low shelf outside; a shrew had performed some sort of light-mannered opera behind the stone where he kept his pan; a beetle of improbable polish had cleaned its face on the edge of his notebook without asking permission and then, with great dignity, left. In the small hours, after the harbour had told its last joke and the town lay on its side, a sound had come up the path like a decision changing its mind. He had listened very hard and discovered it to be the footfall of someone practicing being quiet. He had felt the rope touch his hand before his mind had time to tell him he wanted to remain a ruin, and he had slipped the blue rope down to two knots because he had promised himself that emergency and conversation were different categories and sometimes the distinction is all you have.

The boy in the eyeliner arrived at the doorway with the look of someone attempting to stand like a tree. He failed at tree and succeeded at boy, which was a kinder category for the morning he had had. He had not brought a jacket and had brought a stubbornness that did not repel moisture. His face had lost the theatricality it wore at the harbour; he had a paler honesty around the mouth and the eyes of someone who had discovered that leaving and staying both ask for a price. “I thought you were a wizard,” he announced without preamble, because it is best to rid the room of old assumptions before bringing in new ones. “I am not,” Jory said, and gestured at the pan as if to illustrate his point. “Wizards make fountains obey. I ask water to boil and it thinks about it.” The boy stood with his hands in his pockets as if proving they were empty and not coming, as his mother might have feared, with explosives. “I went,” he said, and then stopped, and the word went hung between them like laundry on a new line.

Jory poured tea into Lena’s cup and did not hand it over until the boy had taken his hands out of his pockets, which is one of those small lessons that help later without admitting to their own seriousness. The eyeliner, which yesterday had been an ornament, had become a smudge, and the smudge had decided to be truthful. “They don’t know,” he said. “By they you mean…” Jory began, and the boy rolled his eyes with a delicacy that suggested affection. “Everyone. Himself. Mam. The one with the small dog. It thinks it’s a horse. I went to the bus stop and I waited until the bus came and then when the door opened, it breathed warm at me, and I couldn’t. Then I came here because you live in a hole and that seemed like not-a-bus.” Jory put the cup into wrists that had the method of someone who uses games to disguise care, and he sat back to adjust the part of his face that wanted to adopt responsibility and had promised not to. “You can sit,” he said. “Or you can stand until standing tells you it is bored with you. If you’re here when the swallows begin counting, you’ll have to tolerate the critique. They are brutal about mornings.”

There are lines a man can draw to protect his vow that are so sharp they cut what they’re meant to hold, and there are lines drawn with a pencil worn down by the business of writing down truths. He found he could keep what he had promised himself and still rescue the smallness in the boy’s mouth. They talked around the word home in a way that made it larger and softer, and eventually the boy spoke of a father whose absence had the weight of a piece of furniture nobody would move and of a mother whose competence had become a story clubbed into shape by other people’s comments. He confessed, with the frail pride of the guilty who want to be believed, that he had packed a bag and left it by the bin because you never think to pick up the thing you have been thinking of picking up when your legs are busy being brave. Jory did not deliver wisdom. He offered the only thing he could without breaking anything delicate: a way down the track that avoided the house with the dog that believed itself a horse, a square of pie Tamsin had consigned to his moral account, and his name, not to hold, but to put in a pocket for the walk. “If you want to arrive without arriving, come by the back of the deli,” he said. “Mab will be serving a man who pretends not to cry. It will distract everyone. Put your hands on the door and breathe before you push. If you don’t push, you can come back and scowl at me from the path. The moor is a better chaperone than I am.”

The boy left having succeeded at neither running nor returning and therefore having achieved the more difficult thing, which is to walk without a reasonable explanation. When he was out of sight Jory retied the blue rope to one knot because he did not want company to feel expected, and then he watched the path for a time, not with his eyes, which were busy with swallows, but with the part of his chest that counts departures like buoys. The tea cooled the way tea cools when it has done the good it was sent to do, and the day lifted itself up on the elbows of its first hour and looked around for what was to be forgiven.

Down by the harbour the ribbons looked tired in a way that pleased Lena. She had not made them to be pretty; she had made them to work, and work had scuffed them in the right places. She had walked past them, not because she wanted reassurance—you do not stand up better because a piece of cloth remembers—but because she had found the discipline of seeing her own handwriting in public close to impossible and wanted to practice. She put her hand on the cold rail for a second and thought about the way metal holds together under salt without making the effort look noble, and then she went up to the barn with a feeling in her stomach like the first coil in her palm, small but with a will.

The bowl had grown. It was not yet the size of a child’s tent, but it had the ambition of anything that has held together without understanding quite how. The handsome mended corner, where she had learned the day before the fundraiser how quickly clay punishes elegance, held its apology with grace. There is a point at which a vessel begins to tell you what it knows about gravity and you either listen or spend three hours pretending your fingers are better at physics than they are. When she put her hand inside and lifted very gently with the heel while her other hand supported the outside with the patience of someone holding up an argument until it can stand on its own, she felt a tremor she could not name. The barn is the sort of room where sounds earn their place, and she heard the vibration the clay made between her palms and stopped moving because she had learned, at last, not to rescue a day from doing its work.

Tamsin appeared with half a bale balanced on a hip as if she had taken up early sculpture. She put it down and watched the rim as one watches a child stepping from stone to stone over a stream. “You’ll be slow now or you’ll be sorry,” she said without malice. “Rob says you can borrow the old lamp if you’re going to be here after the sun decides it’s a different person. He says the oil makes everything look like it was improved by a story.” Lena laughed and pushed the coil just one stitch further and then stopped to tie her apron knots because her fingers had crossed the line into ambition. “Cassia will ask me why I wanted it tall,” she said. “I will tell her because I am short, and then I’ll say something better.” Tamsin sat on the end of a sack and put her boots on the rung of a chair upside down. “It’s a room in a room,” she said. “You’ll need the extra air for when people come inside you with their opinions.”

She did not know yet that she was going to have to practice asking for help before she needed it. That knowledge arrived as a sample a few hours later when two children—Rob’s cousin’s twins with ungovernable appetites for surfaces—wandered into the barn at a trot that had the decency to be loud. They pulled up short at the sight of the bowl the way children stop at the edge of a cliff because something in their bones performs the calculation. “Is that a swimming pool,” one asked, which was a serious compliment in that household. “No,” Lena said, tying the second knot on her apron as if it had always been her plan to tie it at that exact moment, “but it is an argument about where things stop.” The other asked if he could dip his finger in it and leave his name and she said no and handed each boy a coil of reject clay and told them to see how long they could make it before it quit. They accepted the game because she had not made it into one, and she watched their hands do what hands do when given a task linked to breath rather than victory. The bowl listened without requiring them to approve of it, and Lena counted that as a victory she would not write down.

On Cassia’s table the notebook had fanned itself open to a page that had done its own underlining. She sat with her feet under her and a cup in her palm and let her eyes run where they liked, because presiding over attention is a poor way to keep it alive. She had promised herself, a year and a half ago, in an empty bus station at night when the pigeons were outnumbered by the lit advertisements, that she would never again offer a ritual she had not at least attempted to live inside. She did not tell this to clients because it sounded like a sermon, and men and women who come asking to be measured do not always want to be weighed. Her week had been full of small architecture that pleased her; she had watched the man with the bicycles sit in the middle of his floor while the animals inched their way from zebra to donkey with a focus that cured something in him, she had watched Mab count rest by closing on a Wednesday and not apologising, and she had walked past the ribbons at the railing and seen a hand she did not know write the word tenderness with the confusion of someone who had not expected to be allowed.

There was a knock at the door as if someone had remembered how to be polite at the last moment and had not always known they could. When she opened it, Nate Bullen stood with the expression of a man who had arrived by accident at the correct place. He wore the club jumper as if anyone looking might need to be reminded that he belonged to things, and he removed his cap as if crossing a threshold that deserved respect even if he could not articulate why. She gestured him in and did not ask him to sit until he had found a posture in the room that did not look borrowed. “I don’t know what you do,” he said, which is a sentence she had heard delivered as insult and compliment and this was neither; it was a man stating his own limits. “I’m not religious, but I believe in rules because they stop people behaving like weather. The club is a set of rules with gentleness in it, and I have spent ten years keeping that gentleness from getting scratched by opinions. He left.” He paused, because the name inhabited a piece of pride you keep near your keys, and he had not yet got used to leaving it there. “He has gone up a hill with a rope and a pan and has made me feel like the man who tells the tide when it is allowed to come in. I don’t want to feel like that. It makes me talk too much. Fix me.”

She thought of telling him she was not in repairs, but the man in front of her had very carefully let himself come to the room where repairs are not called demeaning. She asked him to speak about the part of the course that had remembered him when his face had changed because if a place can do it a person has a chance. He spoke about the ninth and the way the green sat like a plate at the edge of a table, and about the day he had put his ball where he had not dared and had heard Daz hold his breath for a whole long minute, and he spoke about the membership when they were not speaking and how beautiful men can look when they are simply in arrangement with a landscape. She waited until he had left space that felt like it had room for the future, and then she offered him something that did not need a name. “Pick a practice,” she said. “When you are on the course and not dealing with scores or time sheets or fairness, pick a practice you will not tell anyone about for a month. For those nine or twelve or eighteen stretches of walking, say one thank you that names something and does not permit advice to sneak in. You will say, ‘thank you for the way the grass sang when the mower had not yet calmed it.’ You will not say, ‘and next time we should move the tee because of the low spot.’ If you cannot manage that every hole, do it on four only. Four can be the hole that leaves your mouth alone.” He took this in with the seriousness of a man who had not been offered something small in years. “Four,” he said, because four for him was the hole that had allowed him, once, to kiss his wife on the shaded path when no one saw and to keep that afternoon alive even as other afternoons misbehaved. “I can do four.” He put his cap back on and then took it off because he had forgotten himself long enough to be impolite to the small rules he uses to keep his day upright, and he smiled anxiously. “I’ll not burst into tears if I see him,” he said. “You can if you like,” Cassia replied, “but you might also try telling him about the day the wind took the hat off a stranger and Daz ran farther than he should have to fetch it, and the stranger was so grateful he joined for a month and then left but kept speaking of the hat. He likes stories better than opinions at the moment.” Nate nodded, as if a stone had been handled smoothly and the path ahead made an angle he could love.

The afternoon closed in around the ruin in that generous way Cornish afternoons have, as if the moor and the sea were sharing custody of the light and both wanted to be seen to be fair. Rob appeared at the doorway with an oilskin rolled tight as a poem. “Tamsin says if you won’t wear it, she will, and then you’ll be the fool on the hill instead of the fool in the rain,” he said. “A man from the old lot left it in the back of the barn and never came back for it. He was a painter who lived in the town before it remembered to sell itself. He used to sit on the wall and declare the shapes of clouds as if they needed telling to keep their nerve. He died in Penzance, and nobody remembered the coat in the way people forget to remember the wheelbarrow but not the hand.” He handed it over and watched with the possessive tenderness of someone passing along a tool. “It will smell like fish for a month,” he added. “All the best things do.” Jory unrolled the oilskin and let it make the room smaller in the way only the smell of work can. He had not known he was missing this kind of object, something that had been introduced to sea and sweat the proper number of times to be useful without complaint. He thought of his father, who had believed oilskins were a philosophy, and did not say any of the sentences that came to mind because some nouns deserve their own quiet.

The boy with the eyeliner came back by the path later, halfway around the hour when men stand in their kitchens making the small noises that mean supper is not a magic trick. He did not stop; he only lifted his hand briefly as if letting Jory know that the plan had been taken and not betrayed. He had a bag on his back and it could have been the same one and it could have been a different one, and what mattered was not the bag but the line his shoulders were making now, not martyrdom and not swagger, simply the reasonable angle of someone who has decided to go through a door and remembers to breathe. Jory lifted his two fingers in return because it would have been wrong to clap and wrong to bow and the semaphore of small dignities is a language any man should keep fluent.

There was a day’s work at the wall that asked a kind of patience that felt like prayer without the fuss. The long stone that had been waiting three visits finally admitted its neighbours and lay down, and Rob’s “there” came out with the quiet satisfaction reserved in other men for brand-new machines. The fox, whom Jory had refused the dignity of a name because he had learned not to pull wildness into his own list of property, failed to keep its appointment in the evening and he felt the loss not as a wound but as a lesson, the first one any good relationship teaches: you cannot count on being counted. He sharpened the pencil with his penknife and the smell of cedar took him without his consent back to a school desk with somebody else’s carved heart in it and the girl in the second row who had laughed into her sleeve and then into his mouth years later on Porthmeor behind a boat. He had not thought of her in ten years and it came to him that solitude is no efficient barrier; it is a sieve with better holes.

Hendra gave a sermon the next morning that would have sounded pious if you were the sort of person allergic to domesticity. He stood in front of twelve people and an argument with a leak and spoke about the value of little vows, the ones that do not ask to be thrown a party. He talked about the man he had known in his last parish who had decided, at fifty-three, to stop lying to himself about whether he liked gardening and had given himself the gift of never touching a spade again; the vines, freed of his clumsy intentions, had flourished and his wife had taken up pruning with a pair of shears that made her look biblical. He said that an anchorite wall is not the same as a barricade and that sometimes the most religious thing you can do is answer a knock and sometimes the most religious thing you can do is remain on the other side of the door with your tea and let the person knocking remind themselves why they came. He did not mention Jory; he did not need to because the town’s marrow had already been making whatever liturgy was required. Afterwards he found Cassia at the back, under the hymn board with numbers that referred to songs and accidentally to verses she did not yet know. They spoke about vows as if they were recipes marked in flour on a countertop, and he confessed, with a slanting smile, that he had renewed one that week: to stop telling stories as if other people’s choices were about him. She told him that was architecture and he smiled as if given a new word to put in his drawer and try out when the kitchen was empty.

In the studio, Lena’s hands had become instruments with two tempos. The coil wanted her to be quick; the rim wanted her to take longer than anyone would be comfortable watching. She found the practice Cassia had given her—tying the second knot and then, at a point that might have looked arbitrary to anyone else, untying it and stepping to the window with her glass of water—had a kind of music in it she had been missing in her body. She would not have said dance; she was suspicious of that kind of word when applied to her own limbs. But there was a small choreography here: the turn, the lift, the weight held and released, the glance at the clock only to dismiss it with affection. She had written on a scrap of tape and put it near the tap the word steady, not because she had been told to choose a new word but because margin had taken a job elsewhere that week and steady had turned up with a toolbox and a grin.

She caught herself thinking of Jory at the doorway to the barn as a weight test, which is not a kind thing to think of a neighbour, and she forgave herself because forgiveness was in such easy reach these days. The bowl had reached a height where it would begin to exaggerate any lie she told it, and she did something she would not have done in the season before ribbons. She rolled down the sleeves she keeps for her pride and she telephoned Tamsin and said the sentence that made her a person rather than an advertisement. “If you are about, will you come and look with me, because my eyes have become larger than the room.” Tamsin came and put her head on one side in the way of women who have measured many surfaces without being thanked for it, and she said, “Stop.” It is a hard word if you have set your heart on an arc, but it is kinder, sometimes, than go on. Lena stopped and laughed, because there is nothing more delicious than releasing yourself from an ambition you did not even mean to acquire. They stood together in the barn in a silence she could have lived in for an afternoon and counted the spaces in the air.

By the end of the week, the camera man had sent a postcard. He had taken, perhaps, Cassia’s advice or perhaps someone else’s or perhaps his own common sense had asserted itself after a sandwich. The card was from nowhere in particular; a picture of a hedge with a hole in it big enough for a dog. It said, in a hand that had been taught in a boys’ school to make everything the same height, “Coming back when the hill says yes. You were right to be the opposite of interesting.” Jory placed the card under the stone with the white stripe and told himself he would show it to no one and then told himself he would show it to Lena because she had earned the laugh it would bring to her mouth. He found, with something like satisfaction, that his solitude had not been fenced; it had grown hedges.

In the evening Lew turned up on the path in a state that was not distress and not celebration; it was the mood men carry when they have agreed with themselves to be sensible and are testing that agreement for leaks. He brought with him the smell of engine and tide and the faint chemical harmony of washing powder. “I am not here to make a fuss,” he said by way of greeting, which is a wonderful way to begin a fuss. “Mam is baking enough to feed the ghost of the pier and she has refused to talk about the word anchorite because it gets stuck in her teeth. I told her I would check you were not dead because I was going to the pub anyway. Also,” he added, as if remembering an invoice, “I dreamed dad last night. He was annoyed with me for taking the wrong rope and then forgave me because that is how dreams let you sleep. Did you see the boat the other day. I stood with Mab and we did not talk and it was like being young and being told not to. I am going to come up here on Tuesday and sit on the ground like a fool and see if the hill will let me tell you the story about the time I tried to dig a hole to Australia. Don’t prepare anything.” They did not hug because the doorway did not need that performance. They stood with their heads tilted and the air did the rest.

The week folded in on itself, neat at the edges. The wren began to sit more deliberately than before, a seriousness that suggested the eggs had learned the word inside themselves. The oilskin made the ruin smell like a harbour even when the wind came from the land, and the fox became, not an appointment, but the sort of friend you are pleased by even when he fails to keep his. The blue rope hung at one knot more often than two; he found that the parish was capable of doing its own triage and did not rush up the path with its corrections as often as he had feared, and when it did come it did so mostly to leave things, kindling or news or the kind of bread you eat standing up. He slid into a routine that did not look like a staircase; it looked like a series of stones across a river, and some days were the ones where you put your entire foot on a flat rock and other days were the ones where you land on a point and keep your arms out like a tightrope walker and laugh at yourself.

On a late afternoon so clear it felt as if all the salt had been sifted back out of the air and returned to the jars that wanted it, he sat with his back against the lintel and his notebook on his knee and wrote three futures that were not promises but were useful to imagine. In the first, he stayed for his three months and then went back to the town and became the sort of man who says, “when I was up on the moor,” and people indulged him, and he stopped telling the story when he saw the indulgence. In the second, he stayed longer, and he did not become a statue; he became a man with a scythe and a wall and a small shelf of sentences fit for any visitor. In the third, he left early because of a call he could not ignore, a cough through a thin wall, a boy at the doorway with eyeliner drying on his cheeks, a boat that needed more hands lifting the rails. He closed the notebook on all three and trusted himself to match the right one to the right day when it came because training your attention is not about naming every bird; sometimes it is about keeping your mouth shut when the sky is busy.

He said the sentence he had made, and now it had developed the second half of its rhythm, which you cannot force because rhythm is a matter for bodies. He said, I will go; I will come back; keep the doorway; and he added, without thinking he had added it until the sound had already gone out and been counted by the grass, make me useful without making me necessary. The air, which had been humid to the point that it could have carried advice without spilling it, did not answer. It moved over his face like hands a mother uses to check a fever and then went on to the next person who had asked for something without being quite sure what. The ruin held its one man as if there had always been one man to hold, and the moor thought its old thoughts under everything and allowed the swallows to write their equations through the hour until light became one.Chapter Nine

The moor changed colour the way a person changes their mind—noticeably only when you have been watching too long not to. The gorse flared its old gold and the grasses took on that tired green that means they have been walked by heat as much as by hooves. Jory woke with the certainty that a different weather had decided to run the week and found, when he stood at the doorway to test the air with his wrist, that the sound in the broken window had altered. It was not a song; it was a congregation of small mouths practicing existence. He held very still and felt his chest want to make a noise in answer, and he laughed under his breath because the idea of a man trying to be an echo to a nest deserved laughter as much as reverence. The wren flicked in with a streak that might have been pride and might have been a warning, and he turned his head away like a guest remembering he had no business making eye contact with the altar. He added a line in his notebook in the crooked hand he saved for important things he didn’t want to look like speeches: touch less, look more, don’t narrate.

He took his tools down to Morwenna’s that morning because promises to shelves should not be allowed to rot in the weather. The house smelled like coriander and soap, which was his mother’s way of inviting the world in and scrubbing it before it sat down. The shelf in question had been performing a slow argument with gravity since 1999 and had kept its dignity by pretending it was an angle by design. He dismantled its lie and found at the back of the cupboard a newspaper folded to the crossword and a photograph of a woman with a fringe that had opinions, which his mother took without comment and put in the drawer where she kept receipts for things nobody would ever return. They worked in that tidy domestic silence that feels like a language. Morwenna handed him a pencil without looking when she knew he would need to mark and he planed the stubborn edge down and blew the curl of wood away with an affection he had not felt for timber since school. “Your father,” she said eventually, “used to stick his tongue out when he measured. As if the tongue was a plumb line.” He smiled and kept his tongue in; he was learning, at last, to let certain ways of being end with the person they belonged to. When the shelf agreed at last to act like a shelf he placed the empty jars back on it with ceremony and stood back with her to look. “You’ve made me honest,” she said, and he knew she meant the wall as much as herself, and he kissed her on the hair with the unshowy gratitude he had practiced this week on stones.

In the barn Lena’s bowl had grown like a rumor you hoped was true. It had edges that could not be called edges; it had a line that had remembered to be soft where her hands had not. She had learned to stop at the moment before triumph because triumph is when clay makes a fool of you, and she stepped back and wiped her wrists on her apron with the red string of the second knot pulling her skin in to her. Tamsin came in with a piece of string between her teeth and a list of animals to be wormed in her pocket and walked around the bowl the way a pilot walks around an aircraft before a flight. “You can’t get this in your kiln,” she said, because love speaks first in facts, and Lena felt the old panic rise and then sit down because she had been teaching it to sit. “We’ll fire it here,” Tamsin went on, already making arrangements with the air. “Clamp, not pit. Sawdust, dung, seaweed if Rob for once forgives bringing the ocean to the field. We wait for the night that’s damp underfoot and honest above. We keep the hose and the sense ready. We don’t set the parish alight to make you a goddess.” Lena nodded and felt a fizz at the base of her skull because the plan sounded like an adventure whose permission had already been granted by an adult. She said she would fetch the seaweed herself and Tamsin said she would come along, because nobody should be allowed to walk the tideline gathering fuel for a dream without a witness to the way the gulls discuss your choices.

Cassia had developed a habit of moving through town at a speed that did not alarm anybody and allowed her to overhear the useful things without earning suspicion. The ribbons on the railing had begun to fade into loveliness, which is the fate of cheap cloth under salt; she touched one with her thumbnail and felt the word written into it with stubborn ink. Nate found her by accident outside the grocer’s because his feet had carried him past the ninth without asking permission, and he looked almost embarrassed to have located her without facing the formality of a card or a screen. He told her, as if presenting a finished thing he was prepared to admit had cost him a little, that on four he had thanked the grass for the way it sang when it had not yet dried, and then he had ruined it by thinking about mowing patterns and had started again on the next hole. She congratulated him as if he had walked a mile, which he had, if you counted the distance between a mouth that wants to fix and a mouth that wants to bless. He looked lighter in the eyes and older in the mouth, which is to say he had practiced being kind to himself in a public place, and he wasn’t sure yet whether it suited him. “If you have any prayers lying around,” he muttered, and she shook her head because she had stopped issuing prayers and had started handing out chairs. “Bring a chair to four,” she said. “Not a literal one. A place to sit in your head. If you try to be grateful standing up all the time you’ll start resenting the floor.”

When Lew came up on Tuesday, he brought a biscuit tin full of screws and odds because he could not bear to arrive with only his story. He settled himself on a stone with careful dignity and looked at the horizon until the need to be clever left his face. “I dug down to Australia,” he began, and he kept his hands on his knees so they would not try to improve the tale. He told the truth that every boy tells when he is ready to stop pretending all his attempts at escape were earnest. He had dug until his arms were sore and his pride had engaged and his mother had called him in for tea and he had told her it was nearly done. He had dreamed that night of the moment his spade would break the heat of a different summer and had woken to rain that had filled the hole with its own plan. They laughed at the same second and then fell quiet because the second thing came in—the one where you admit what the first thing had been trying to hide. He said he had not gone very far in his life and sometimes that looked like failure and sometimes it looked like love, and Jory said that staying is a form of walking if you pay attention and that leaving is not a morality, it is only a direction. The wren scolded them for a minute and then forgave them their voices. Somewhere down the slope a lamb practiced being separated and learning it could live. Lew wiped his cheek with the back of his hand in a distracted way and the gesture made him twelve and forty at once, and then he shook his head and said something impolite about onions to turn the air. They ate pasties that tasted of piperade and long hours and did not talk about their father until the silence had held them both long enough to make the using of his name look less like begging.

The day before the firing they went for seaweed as if they were collecting other people’s sentences. The beach had been combed by a wind with tidy habits; long fronds lay in ropes that looked like punctuation. Tamsin knew the names in her mouth in the old way and called one bladderwrack and another knotted wrack as if she had been introduced properly at a dance. Lena put the damp ropes into sacks and felt, with a small shame that did not last, that she was stealing from the sea to make something that would live inland. “It likes being borrowed,” Tamsin said, because she had the gift of diagnosing a face from behind. “It wants to leave its handwriting on your pot and then go back to its gossip. We were not put here to keep things in their right rooms.” They carried the weight up the hill in two trips that left their shoulders arguing and their laughter messy, and in the yard they spread it to breathe. Rob came by with the narrowed look of a man picturing flame and told them where they could build their clamp so that a fire would run well and a mistake would die. He drew a square in the grass with the heel of his boot and in the square they set that neat architecture—brick base borrowed from the pile that had wanted to be useful, sawdust a kind of hush, cowpats that Tamsin treated with the respect you give any domestic miracle, sticks and logs laid like ribs and lungs, the seaweed on top to make smoke draw the story across the body of the bowl.

Cassia appeared with nothing in her hands, which is how you should arrive at a fire that is going to change something that matters. She did not offer a speech or a blessing because the room had its own grammar and she did not care to put her handwriting on it. She walked round the clamp once with her head bluntly tilted and then she found Lena’s eyes and gave her the smallest nod, the one that says stop trying to be brave and simply be. Rev. Hendra came up the track with his collar in his pocket because he had been pulled away from a complaint about the hymn numbers, and he put the collar on without much theatre and stood at the edge of the field as if asking permission to have a feeling. He did not lay hands on the bowl because nobody with sense touches a vessel at this hour unless they mean to carry it, but he did say, out loud and without italics, that they were about to ask both earth and fire to be polite and fierce at the same time, and that success would be measured by the shape of what they learned rather than the exact line of the rim. Tamsin snorted softly because clergymen will find a way to make sentences and she had long since decided which of them she would allow into her kitchen. Rob checked the hose with the sensual attentiveness of a man who had been forgiven one flood by his wife and did not intend to require another, and Daz arrived with a bag of marshmallows that he managed to turn into a gesture of respect by not opening it.

They lit it at dusk because the skin between day and night takes fire more willingly, and the first tongues were as always smaller than you think and more determined. The seaweed gave up its secrets in curls the colour of old photographs, and the smoke drew itself over the bowl as if reading. The field became a room with one job. People were there and then persuaded themselves to stand back without instruction, and the small talk, which would have been vulgar any other evening, fell away in favour of comments like, “there,” and “enough,” and once, from Tamsin, “no.” Lena stood for a time and then sat when Cassia pointed to a sensible bit of grass as if she had built a chair into it for just this purpose, and she let her hands hang between her knees so the shaking that was not fear could reach the ground. She did not look at the rim for long stretches because she had learned that staring at what you love when it is becoming only begs it not to move.

Jory came and stood at the far edge where the fox usually performed and let the heat reach his face as far as his vow would allow. He had told himself over tea that he would come down for the lighting and leave after the first long burn had been admitted because the hill had laid a claim and he had not finished proving himself loyal to it. He watched the way Rob’s hand hovered, not to interfere but to learn the language of the flame so he could translate it later to a tree. He watched the way Hendra took his collar off again when he realised it itched more than God would care about. He watched the way Cassia borrowed nobody’s attention and returned it in the shape of breath. He stepped close enough to catch Lena’s eye only once, and he did not nod because nothing needed nodding, but the look they exchanged had the courtesy of a handshake across water. He left without the theatre of farewell and walked up the track in light that felt like it had listened to a good story and was considering telling it to the sea.

The night made its promises and kept them. The clamp spoke in pops and sighs and long strings of hush, and every so often a man would say, “watch,” in a way that made the women grin because men forgive flame its behaviour when it looks like their own. Tamsin sent people home at the point where staying would turn the act into camping and camping would turn it into romance, and she and Rob and Lena kept the watch with the easy rotation of people who have learned not to insist on heroism. Alec, the boy with the eyeliner, arrived with a sandwich he had made without cutting the crusts off and sat on the far tyre as if he had been instructed in posture; he did not try to be helpful but he did take a turn with the hose when told, and the gravest thing he did was not use the moment to show his bravery to anybody. By two the fire had moved into its intelligences and by three the stars had agreed to come closer, and at four a wind came up from the sea to ask questions and was answered. Lena dozed in those three-minute fits that are kind to the spine and cruel to the dream, and woke once to find Cassia had draped Tamsin’s jacket over her and Tamsin had the hose in her lap like a sleeping cat and Rob had his boots off to ease a nail that had been testing him for a week.

In the morning the air had the smell of listened-to news. They let the heat take its time admitting defeat and by nine they could go in without turning the day back on. The bowl lay in its ash like a creature that had decided to accept the names offered and keep its own. It wore the seaweed’s handwriting in smoky greens and the sawdust’s thumbprint in greys you cannot buy, and along one third of its curve a crack had travelled with the politeness of a guest choosing the longest route. For a second Lena did feel the drop of her stomach that belongs to loss, and then the line revealed itself for what it was—a seam that let the eye discover the inside while the bowl remembered its job. Tamsin breathed like she had just walked a hill, which she had, without moving. Rob leaned his weight on his thighs and gave a little grunt of approval that he would later deny was anything like a prayer. Hendra, who had promised himself he would not baptise anything without being asked, put his hand above the rim and said, “well done,” to the heat. Cassia watched Lena’s face and saw the moment she decided not to erase the seam and loved her for that decision more than she had loved her for any sentence she had ever made.

They moved it—the three of them, then four when Alec stepped in without waiting to be knighted—like you carry a sleeping child, murmuring to their wrists the whole time so they wouldn’t try to be lions. It took the corner into the barn with a sternness that made everyone remember not to trip, and when it was down on the timbers Lena had laid, the barn felt taller by two inches. They stood around and had the sort of rowdy silence that counts as a party in some families. Tamsin fetched mugs with bits of ash still under her nails and Rob ate bread like the sea and the field had split the cost, and Cassia put a hand flat on the outside of the bowl as if acknowledging a colleague. Alec, who had not asked for what this meant because he had learned in short order that questions make the meaning lie, touched the seam with one finger and then put his hand in his pocket the way a boy will when he doesn’t want to break what he has just understood.

By noon the town had already started telling the story of the bowl without knowing yet where it was going to be put, because towns hate a blank more than they hate a broken thing. Mab swore she would serve soup in it and then swore again when someone told her not to be ridiculous, and the deli put a note in its window with nothing but an arrow and the word listen, and Daz tried to set up a stall selling seaweed and was prevented by Tamsin who told him this seaweed had better places to be. Nate stopped at the barn door and took off his cap in that way he had borrowed from his father, and then he stood outside and did not go in because four was later and he had made a pact with his mouth. He told the next person who asked him a question that he had never liked art and then said, with a blush that would have offended him had he seen it, “but I like when things hold.”

That evening Jory went to the volunteers’ barbecue with the particular wariness of a man about to enjoy himself in a room full of men who might notice. The lifeboat had been washed and preened and stood like a horse in a painting, and the crew wore the expressions of people who were prepared to be praised as long as it did not go on. He found himself lodged between the chandlery man and a woman who had baked a tray of sausages with the precision of an organ tuner, and for a time that could have been longer he did not say anything that tried to organize anyone else’s day. Nate appeared and did not begin a speech and was patted with relief by the invisible god of pubs. “Tell it,” he said to Jory without elaborating which it he meant, and Jory realised his own mouth had a story in it that had been practiced without his permission. He told them about the blue rope and the two knots and the boy who had wanted the bus to take him to a place that would not be waiting for him at the end. He did not talk about vows because men with aprons and tongs have only so much appetite for Latin, but he spoke about practicing being a door or a wall according to the minute, and someone made a noise that was not humor and not scorn but recognition, and Daz said something about saints and windows, and Mab told him he was banned from theological remarks until he could make change without dropping coins. They laughed like men do when the air has carried something for them and brought it back unbroken. Later, after the paper plates had made their small complaint against sauce and been thrown, Nate leaned on the railing with him and said, “Four was good,” and they did not need to trade more currency than that.

When night sat itself down properly, the ruin felt different because Jory felt different in it. He had made himself useful without trying to be necessary and had come home with that thin hum men get in their bones when the day has not asked them to show off. The wren fed in the dark because wrens are rude and he admired her for it, and the fox failed to walk the wall because foxes own their cancellations, and somewhere under his palm the stone with the white stripe had warmed and then surrendered its heat back to the room. He lay with his head where he could see the piece of sky he had chosen to be responsible for and said his sentence with the new clause rhyming inside it. He said, I will go; I will come back; keep the doorway; make me useful without making me necessary; and because he had done both directions in one day, the words had fewer manners and more rightness. The air went past him with errands and did not answer, which he had learned was as close a thing to a blessing as any of them were going to get on a Monday.

The next morning he went down to the barn and stepped inside the bowl because you cannot make a room like that in a parish and not try it on. The curve made his shoulders change their idea of where they ought to be, and sound behaved itself like a good dog and came when called. He sat with his back to the seam and wondered if this is what being inside your own mouth would be like if you were kinder to yourself. Lena laughed at him the way you laugh at someone trying a hat and finding it suits them better than they care to admit. “People will want to leave things in it,” she said, not alarmed, diagnosing truth. “Stones. Folded paper. Coins if they are clumsy. I will need a rule and then I will need to break it and then I will need to forgive myself for both.” He told her about a line in a book about anchorites and cats and windows, and she told him about seaweed that writes in smoke and how it flirts when you are not looking. They were both a little giddy because something had happened that belonged to neither of them and to both of them, which is the trick of any good thing in a town. He stepped out and put his hand on the rim to steady it, as if it had been the one to wobble, and he felt the day get bigger.

He walked back up the hill with the oilskin under his arm because it was too warm to wear it and because he had begun to like the way it made him smell like a boat even when the path was dust. The blue rope hung at one knot and the doorway sycamore gave him a leaf without pretending it was a gift, and the nest coughed a tiny chorus that made the hair on his arm do what it had wanted to do since he was six. He considered the three futures he had written and a fourth came and sat down among them, a smaller future which said nothing about an outcome and everything about a posture. It said: keep finding ways to be present in rooms that do not belong to you; keep finding ways to leave before you are tired. He grinned at himself because turning almost anything into a plan was a weakness he could not outgrow, and then he forgave himself because forgiveness was coming cheap this week and there was enough to go round without rationing.

By late afternoon the rumour of the bowl and the news of the wren and the memory of the boat and the practice on four had braided themselves into the town’s day like sea rope on a harbour post. The deli’s arrow kept pointing at the wrong thing and right thing at once and people followed it in the agreeable way people like to be directed when they know what they will find and are ready to be surprised anyway. Hendra wrote a note on a scrap of paper and slid it under the church mat that said in his neat worst handwriting, “no evensong if my voice has become smoke,” and Cassia stood on Porthmeor for a minute with her eyes closed to see which part of her lungs the tide would alter today. Nate paused at the ninth and put his hand on the fence in precisely the same place he had put it when he first met his wife at nineteen without knowing he would marry her, and Daz stood at the ice machine like a priest tending a temperamental god and felt, for once, grateful to be the man who sorts out other people’s noise. Morwenna took a bun out of the oven and put it back in because to feed a town that had just watched fire you must respect the level of sugar.

When darkness came, not like a curtain but like a friend who does not knock, Jory lay down and did not plan the next day with as much rigor as he had planned this one. He let the fox decide whether to keep time. He let the wind choose which corner to try. He let the wren be rude. He said his sentence without polishing it and then did the smallest of his devotions, which was to place a pebble in his mouth for the length of twenty breaths so he would not spoil the air with any stray commandments, and when he took it out, he put it on the lintel with the white-banded one and the flint and the pencil and the new feather, and the arrangement made a kind of local religion he did not need to name. The moor thought its old thoughts and made room for several new ones without a fuss. The night went on, which is all you can ask of it, and he slept in the simple knowledge that in the morning there would be a bowl to go and sit inside and a wall to learn, and neither would require him to be better than he could be.
