Florence woke as if lifting a silk veil, the city stretching its lean stones and scrubbing dawn from its eyelids. Livia had always loved that moment, when the Arno turned its surface to brushed bronze and the shop shutters on the Ponte Vecchio snapped open like instruments clicking. She perched on the edge of a terracotta gutter, wings folded close so nobody would see, toes curled around the clay. The first bus grumbled past along Via dei Bardi, a sound like a tired dragon. The statues in the loggias and on church facades looked almost relieved, as if the night’s immobility had been a posture too long held. Her hand shook as she tied a ribbon at her wrist. It was old habit; a charm for fidelity to one’s craft. The ribbon had belonged to her mother.

“Livia,” Aunt Ghita called from the skullcap of the dome across the river. Fairies travel in peculiar ways when the air is thick with thermal updrafts, and today it was; Geranium heat mixed with bread ovens, steaming sweat of laundry in quiet courts. “Come down. Don’t be theatrical.”

Livia tucked her black hair behind her ear, blew warmth onto her knuckles, and hopped. The air caught her with a sigh. “I’m not theatrical,” she said, though in truth she felt like a looped ribbon today, always snagging on herself.

“Don’t gnaw that ribbon. You have a habit of making things into talismans,” said Ghita. She was older than most of them yet somehow always the quickest. Stone-pale, green eyes sharp as shards of bottle glass, the older fairy had been binding wounds since the time of bandits. The city carried her fingerprints in its mortar.

“I need the ritual,” Livia said. She landed on the rim of a fountain facing the Ponte, her heels catching moss. The trickle sounded like someone secret-speaking.

“Ritual is useful until it becomes a cage.” Ghita’s mouth twisted. The morning’s task waited between them like a loaf to be broken. “We’re expected at the Porcellino before the tour buses arrive. Tommaso’s mother sent word. The boy fell. Elbow. Won’t stop bleeding. We do what we are for.”

The word bled was a burr in the ear. Livia heard it too loudly. The edges of her vision took on a dull sugar-crust, sparkling where they should not. She nodded too quickly. “Right. We do what we are for.”

“But,” Ghita said. Her voice softened, if only because she remembered being seventeen. “If you feel faint you step back. No bravado. I’m doubly prepared.”

“Prepared how?” Livia asked, lips dry.

Ghita shrugged a satchel off her shoulder and showed a jar of powdered madder, its threads bright as peppers. “Color helps. You know this. We’ll hearten the skin. We’ll show it how to remember itself.” She looked at her niece, at her niece’s new badlands under the eyes and the small tremors in her mouth. “It cannot be as bad as you imagine.”

Unfortunately, fear does not listen to reason; it takes on its own architecture and becomes a monastery dedicated to itself. Livia had discovered this the week a thief fell from a wall by Santa Croce and landed wrong. She and Ghita had been there with others, doing what their kind keeps hidden—small corrections to flesh, three-needle stitches, the whisper to a clot to hurry. But the thief coughed, and the taste of iron filled the air, and the ribbon on Livia’s wrist seemed to bite her skin. Her stomach turned into a boat. She had backed away then, embarrassed and furious with herself for seeing red wash the world like spilled wine.

Since that evening, it had gotten worse. A scraped knee; a papercut on her step-sister’s thumb; the sticky smear of tomatoes on a cutting board. She had begun to avoid butcher stalls in San Lorenzo market, avoiding also Carnival, and her own reflection when she wore red. If it had been only a squeamishness, it might have passed. But their work was wound and undoing of wound, and she had begun to dread even the suggestion of it. It’s ridiculous, she told herself. We used to press lilies into the wounds of spice merchants and make them laugh again. We used to hum bones back to their proper angles. What happened to you?

As they crossed the piazza, a baker shouted to a delivery boy, and pigeons flapped like an insult. Livia kept her eyes on the ground’s worn stones, on gum blots papa called the city’s contemporary fresco.

The Porcellino—the bronze boar famous for the way it shone where everyone stroked its snout—waited beneath its glass canopy, its mouth always wet. Two tourists were already there at this hour, and a woman with shopping bags. The boy on the bench beside the fountain had a clever, tight face as if he bit pencils. He was pale with indignation. His blood had a foundry smell in it.

“Tommaso,” Ghita said. “Una piccola disavventura?” She gentled the tone. Not everybody sees fairies—one must choose to be seen, a delicate slanting of the air—but the boy was not old enough to have chosen. He looked past them for his mother, and only the mother saw. People who want to do so see us. Others spend their lives not looking up from their phones.”

His mother nodded as if to herself. She had a face that knew long lines and the keeping of accounts. “He took a shortcut. It is nothing, signora. Only—”

“Only for children a small cut is a large theater,” Ghita said, and would have smiled if not for the child’s trembling lower lip. She pulled from her bag a roll of clean cloth and the jar of madder. She motioned. Livia’s job would be to dab with a damp sponge, to keep the field clear. The work began like a tune they had sung a hundred times.

Livia knelt. She took Tommaso’s little arm in the cup of her three fingertips. He smelled of milk and iron, of milk gone to iron. She wet the sponge. The red was only a stripe. She touched it and the world yawned.

To those watching, nothing dramatic happened; Livia’s face drained, its flush ghosted out, and she steadied herself with one hand against the boar’s base. To Livia, anything that moved took on too much context. Every flutter contained the expectation of the worst. Her fingers were not precisely hers. She tried to focus on Ghita’s humming. She tried to look at the jar of madder. The red in the jar was a safe red; a plant red, a known red. Tommaso sniffed bravely. Livia swallowed. She dabbed again.

“Bene,” Ghita murmured. “Good girl. See? It behaves. Tommaso, pig feet must be careful at sharp-cornered stones, hmm?” She smiled, and to her credit, Tommaso smiled back and rolled his eyes.

“Pigs don’t have feet,” he started, and then his mouth wobbled.

“Hooves,” Livia said, the word popping stupidly out. She sounded like a clown. Her palms sweated. The red at the cut bled like a sun under water, but less now, less, Gentling. Ghita sprinkled the powdered spice and blew softly. The pigment licked the air like a small fire, and then it was as if the skin remembered itself after all. The cut did what cuts usually did with help, it tightened, closed, thought better of letting the world in.

The city went on around them. Someone put a coin in the boar’s mouth and the coin dropped, clinked off the grate. The tourists took a photo and half-smiled.

When it was done, the child’s mother reached to touch Livia’s hand in thanks. The contact startled Livia in some deep pocket of her elbow. She pulled back. The thank-you scraped across her skin like sand. “Mi scusi,” the mother said, not offended, merely confused.

“She’s young,” Ghita covered. “We were all new once, even if we do not remember it that way.”

When they left the shade of the market and took to the narrow, devouring corridors of the Oltrarno, Livia did not speak. Her head felt full of bees. There was no reason to feel ashamed; she had done her part. Still.

“You helped,” Ghita said, after a time. “And nothing dreadful ate you whole.”

“I know.” Livia stared at her knuckles. She flexed them just to feel something she could control. “It’s like the air becomes soup. It’s like someone tilted the world and red is heavier than the rest.”

“I have heard that before,” Ghita said, so simply that Livia looked up, startled. “When solids become liquids. You won’t like what I say next, but I will say it.” She hesitated, and that in itself was unusual. “We can choose the crafts we lean into, but the clan expects healers to know their ground. You can’t avoid it forever.”

“I don’t want to avoid it,” Livia said. “I want to not feel ridiculous.”

“Work then. Slow work and foolish stubbornness. Or you leave healing to others and take up a different corner of our work. We always have menders of sandals, coverers of cracks in the Baptistery. Someone must persuade pigeons to behave at funerals. Someone must lean poems into the cracks of bridges. We are more than shoreline nurses. But I will not lie: those who bleed occassionally need us.”

Livia stopped. A scooter rattled past, two kids with hair like weeds. “Occasionally,” she said, tasting the syllables. “I’ll try harder. I tried to. Today was something.”

“I saw you hold a boy’s arm like a song. That is something.”

She walked back toward home in a different path than Ghita’s, because she needed the day to happen to her on her own. The house she shared with her father and with Marta and with Signora Corradi, who insisted on being called by her maiden name even though she had married Livia’s father late and laughing, sat behind a pomegranate tree near Santo Spirito. The pomegranates fell and split like small hearts in autumn. In summer the tree’s shade was the right size for small people and those who liked books.

Marta was in the yard with her phone, as she always was; a slender human with soft, anxious hands and a forever cut on her thumb from bitten cuticles. She had those brave shoulders that look like they would carry more than anyone would ever ask of them. She had moved in two years ago with her mother; Livia had not known then what a step-sister was supposed to be like. She had decided: like a translation that sometimes improves the original.

“You’re back!” Marta looked up at the sound of the gate—the flutter of the latch was a language they all spoke—and smiled with her whole face. “Ghita sent me a message. How did it go, topolino?”

Livia made a face she hoped was a “fine” face, something between triumphant and bland. “Boy. Cut. Porcellino. Ghita made it into a story about pigs.”

“Pigs are good stories,” Marta said. “I was filming the way the sun slid down the antennae. Do you want coffee?” She had already set up a stove on the battered table that had once lived in a sculptor’s back room and now served for card games and secret councils and the slow preparation of tomato sauces.

“I want the coffee to be a grave and for me to climb inside it,” Livia said.

Marta paused. She had a face that could go still all at once. “Okay. We can do grave coffee. With sugar.”

They stood and waited for the water to climb into its boiling self, and a cat from somewhere made that noise cats make when the dream about birds in the afternoon. The small domesticities glowed for Livia more than usual, like someone had polished them. She took the tiny cup when Marta handed it to her and inhaled. The smell had a sweetness that was almost bitter. In the steam she could smell her mother’s hair; impossible, since her mother had gone into a different shape years ago, a light shape, belonged now more to air than to earth. But some smells are keys anyway.

“You’re thinking about your mother again,” Marta said softly. This was not a guess. It was a true sentence, which was Marta’s specialty.

“She would have told me to stop being dramatic. Or she would have told me what to do. Or she would have pinned me with a look until I did it without explanation. Any of these. All.” Livia swallowed. “I am too much inside my own head. It stinks in there.”

“Of course it does. How else would it be yours?” Marta leaned her hip against the table. “But also, you came home. People who cannot bear themselves run away into very long corridors and say the word ‘abroad’ as if it explained everything.”

Livia squinted. “You call going to Siena abroad and you call the space between our rooms abroad. For you everything is a border.”

“Yes,” Marta said, unoffended. “It is safer that way. I can cross small borders. Large borders are for people with better hair.”

Livia burst out laughing, in spite of herself. Her breath came back to ordinary. She let herself look at Marta properly. The girl had not been on this earth long enough to have developed all her powers, but the ones she had were well kept. She wore shorts that made Livia think of summers she had not yet lived. On the table, her phone buzzed and glowed. She had been editing something—it was apparent in the way her thumb slid with purpose. The tiny screen showed a loop of olive branches jittering in the wind and a voice-over: Marta’s voice, low, humming, telling a story about shade.

“Another one?” Livia asked.

“I’m testing some new cuts,” Marta said. “And the people who watch like when I talk about the sound things make at specific times. Not just the way they look.” She glanced at her and then looked away, as if not to make it too intense. “Before you show me your face of doom—no, I won’t put your face in any of them. Unless you want to. I know, I know. We promised. But I like this. Shh.” She half danced a little, embarrassed, then stilled.

“I didn’t say a word,” Livia said, though in truth she had wanted to roll her eyes, only gently. It wasn’t that she minded the videos; it was that the world in Marta’s phone had a hunger in it, too. Anything could be eaten by it. Sometimes when she went to look at a statue at night, someone would be filming it. She wanted it for themselves some nights and it hurt to put it next to a million click hearts that jumped like a fever.

“You don’t approve,” Marta said, but not defensively; as if asking to be corrected.

“I approve,” Livia said. “I like what you make. You’re good. You make people who can’t come here understand,” she added, reluctantly and with honesty. “I get worried for you, maybe. That the glowy rectangle will decide it gets to keep you. But you’ll bite its fingers, yes?”

“I’ll keep my teeth ready,” Marta said gravely. “And but. And anyway. I might have a question for you later. It’s not big. Don’t worry. It isn’t about putting your face in things. It’s something fun. Can things be fun? Do we allow that here?”

“You’re strange,” Livia said. It was stock phrase. It meant I am listening. It meant: I love you.

“Sto facendo un tentativo,” Marta said, attempting to make her words sound as if her mother had said them. She did a decent impression. “We try.”

They were interrupted by the appearance in the doorway of Signora Corradi, Marta’s mother, wearing a towel like a crown and smelling of soap. “Macchie di sugo everywhere, Dio,” she lamented to nobody. “I will die having washed tomatoes from the world.” She shifted her gaze to the girls and smiled. “My daughters,” she added, then pinched Marta’s shoulder. The word daughters still surprised Livia when it showed up on the table like an unexpected guest, and yet it fit. A step-sister is a sister is a thing you step into. “Go wash your hands,” Signora Corradi said to Livia, out of habit, as if she were six. Livia went, out of habit, as if she were six.

Her father came later, with olives and a bad pun. He was a woodcarver who could coax angels into revealing themselves, who had a way of putting too much pepper on everything. He had a scar under his eye from a shelf falling when he was a child; he insisted his vices had been punished by the shelf. He had always known about the fairies because, truth be told, he had come from them. He had married a human woman and then, after years and griefs, another human woman. He made his life a path in the city, but there was always a bend in it where something else could appear. “I saw Ghita on the bridge,” he said, dropping a kiss on his daughter’s hair. “She said you were brave.”

“She also said I looked like a fish pulled from the Arno,” Livia said.

“A brave fish,” he said politely.

They ate. They told the day’s small stories. The world scratched at the windows. The words blood and enough and again did not appear on the table. The table thanked them.

Later, when everyone had drifted toward their necessary dusk—Ghita to the meeting beneath the cypresses, Signora Corradi to call her sister and correct her about a recipe, Livia’s father to sand the palm of a hand he had carved until it felt like a real hand—Livia took her feet to the Boboli. The garden has places that do not care about people, and those are the places fairies frequent, for relief. She went to the Amphitheater, the windows of trees frowned like grandparents above her, and she let a handful of pine needles trickle between her fingers. She thought, classically, melancholy thoughts: that she had disappointed the city itself by being a creature who cannot do what she was supposed to do. She thought newer thoughts, too: that perhaps the city did not require any one person to be everything, that perhaps everything could be distributed, that perhaps and yet.

Footsteps came up behind her on the path in a rhythm she knew. The person who walked that way was always trying to be quiet and always failed.

“Luciano,” she said, without turning.

“Best not to call me that where the roses can gossip,” said the newcomer. He was her friend of long watches and races down fountain edges; he had two missing teeth and pretended to be proud. Piero to most, Luciano to nobody anymore. He had a problem with staying out of things that were not of his business; this made him useful and dangerous. “You look like those caryatids with their hands under the weight,” he said, half-kind, half-irritating. “Aunt Ghita told me you did well.”

“Aunt Ghita also thinks the moon is a plate that needs washing,” Livia said.

“She’s right more than she’s wrong,” he said, not missing a beat. He leaned, splayed, folded himself like a napkin. “The thing at the bridge the other night—it shook you. Who could blame you? My cousin forty-seven lives in a city where they keep a refrigerator just for blood. He fainted at an advertisement, they say. He revived only when a dog barked. If you must compare yourself, compare yourself to that.”

“I don’t want to compare myself,” Livia said. “I want to not be owned by a word.”

“Don’t be owned by the word then. Own the word. Put it on a chain and drag it around. Bloody bloody blood blood, see? Look, I can say it.” He hee-hawed. The sound seemed to bother even himself. “Sorry. It’s late. Come to the quarry tonight. We’ve stolen a lantern. We’ll tell secrets into a bottle.”

“I’m not in the mood for stolen lanterns,” Livia said. “Or secrets. Most secrets are just sausages with different seasonings.”

Piero sighed. “So wise, so tragic. You sound like poetry that didn’t get invited to a party.” He hesitated, then thrust his chin in the direction of the city. “You know the queen will hear. About this. She keeps a book of all of us and our doings. Someone will whisper. She will think you’re choosing fear as an occupation. She might not let you near the candles at the next Righting.”

“I’m not a soldier,” Livia said. The word Righting fit a ceremony that required a large amount of candles, a bench lacquered with words, a knot of hands.

“No. But you are your mother’s daughter. She remembers. She expects.” Piero scratched his ear. “I’m not trying to be cruel. I’m trying to push you and failing. Let me try a different thing: I’m hungry. Come get gelato with me.”

“I want not to have a body,” Livia said, and then relented. “Fine, pistachio. If the boy at the cart is there. The one with the eyebrows. They are funny.”

“The boy with the eyebrows is always there,” Piero said. “He is a fixture. If they move him the whole quarter shifts by six centimeters.”

They walked down into the cool corridors of the city, where the sun went around corners slowly. They ate gelato and did not talk about difficult things. They let the cream and the cold adjust their breathing. She watched the boy with the eyebrows fill cones. His hands were precise, his brows ached with concentration. He never wasted a scoop. She envied that peace, the way his fingers knew what to do. She licked her wrist where the gelato melted and felt fine for a whole minute.

The queen did hear. Queens always do. In Florence, there are councils for everything, and one of theirs meets by the old fig tree that grows the wrong way because a lightning once encouraged it. Queen Smeralda had a face made of flour and a voice like folded paper. She wore shoes she had stolen and a brooch she had made herself, a green glass thing from a bottle melted and pressed. She sent for Livia the next afternoon. The message was a pigeon feather with a knot at the end, tied onto their door knocker, absurd, old-world. Marta found it. She unknotted it with her teeth.

“Uh-oh,” she said, without mockery. “Green broomstick. What did you do?”

“I existed,” Livia said.

Marta walked with her as far as the gate, then stopped, as if an invisible line had stopped her. “I’ll wait,” she said, and did not try to go further, because boundaries in this house were flexible but not imaginary.

When Livia came to the fig tree, the queen wasn’t alone. There was a cluster of the old ones: Zita, who smugly baked bread nobody could digest; Old Bastiano, who remembered the Price of Salt; Benedetta, who had opinions about such specific matters that nobody could write them all down. They regarded Livia the way a court regards a petition: gently, with interest, but with a certain fatigue.

“Livia d’Arno,” said the queen. “Scion of Murmur and of Anna Teresa, who stitched a bridge back together the night a truck hit it. We hear that you grow unsteady in the sight of certain colors.”

“Yes,” Livia said. She wanted to lie and could not. “I get dizzy.”

“The river has been dizzy,” said Old Bastiano, apropos of nothing.

“Yes,” said the queen. “The river is dizzy when people argue above it. You know this is not about being brave,” she went on, and this took Livia aback, in a pleasant way. “You may wake up brave or you may go to bed brave or you may never be brave in the ways that are easiest to hear about. But we need hands. We are not many. I will not accept refusal without understanding.”

“I don’t refuse,” Livia said. “I don’t embrace. I flinch. And then sometimes I proceed anyway,” she added, because humility grows tiresome even when it is new.

The queen’s mouth twitched. “Satisfactory,” she said. “If it stays at flinch and proceed. If it becomes flinch and fail—then you choose a different alley to sweep.” She glanced at the others. Zita nodded, reluctantly; Benedetta made a noise like a pot settling. “We will also do this,” the queen said, as if remembering to share a bit of cake. “We will pretend to be the people you are afraid of and you will practice on us. We will counterfeit the smell of iron and you will have your soup air and then you will walk through it and not fall down. We did this with your mother when she could not stand narrow spaces. She learned to climb wells. We taught her by trapping her under a table. You can be angry. She was.”

“I can,” Livia said, and her hands had learned to shake again, despite the coffee and the gelato and Marta’s hair-braiding. “Thank you. I think.”

“We do not always get to be delicate,” said the queen. “And yet we will try. Because this new city of ours is mad with screens and with cars and with shouts, and we must also be the velvet.”

The practice began. The old women came with packets of something from old museums, and a coil of copper wire, and a piece of liver from the butcher wrapped in paper; and Livia wanted to cry or laugh or insulting-bow, she wasn’t sure which. They put the coil on a table. They burned rosemary and they sung nonsense syllables that meant courage when someone knows where to aim them. Zita produced a vial of red wine. Livia stood. She did not run. She did not faint. She did not like any of it.

The morning followed the afternoon, and at the end of it, she went home with a hunger that gnawed her spine. She thought she would eat and then sleep and then push again at the wall. She was ready to push every day for a year if she had to. She washed her hands. She raised her head.

In the kitchen, Marta was sitting with her elbows on the table, both hands around her phone, not scrolling. She had that look like someone who had been about to tell a joke and then had put the joke down. “I started a thing,” she said, when Livia came in. “And we can make of it what we want. Or nothing, if it scares you. But I want to say it instead of not saying it and regretting it until my old age when I have only one tooth left.”

“Ah,” Livia said. She pulled a chair, sat. “Say the thing.”

“I made a channel,” Marta said. She swallowed. “On YouTube. I made it. Fine. Let me repeat: I made another channel, but this one is not about olives or stairs. It is about small things that repair other small things. I thought—well, you know. I thought about the fact that not all mending is about blood and not all blood is a catastrophe and also, and also, and also. I wanted to make a place to play at being brave. I thought we could do a series. Anonymous. Hands only. Voice only. No faces. We can call it Ten Thousand Little Rightings, or something better. I don’t know. It’s. stupid? I don’t know. But please look.”

Livia stared at her. The word YouTube sat on the table like an animal they had not invited. She didn’t know whether to laugh or to throw a dishtowel over it. “Marta…”

“Don’t jump to the end of your objections,” Marta said, holding up both hands. “I know you. You climb to the top of the objections and wave a scarf. It is not—this is not about taking you and making you content for strangers. It’s about making a room inside a room. We can play with the things you can tolerate. We can work on fear sideways. There is the sound of envelopes closing. The sound of tea bags soaking. The sound of knees not breaking. If we decide later it is nonsense, we can stop. The internet can eat itself. But maybe we will find a little path through. And maybe other people who need those small rightings will listen in the night and feel less alone.”

Livia felt a curious thing: a small unhooking in her chest. A new little door. She put her palms face down on the table and breathed. “This is silly.”

“Very,” Marta said, sincerely.

“This is also not as silly as pretending under a table to be under a well.” She covered her face and peered through her fingers at her step-sister. “What would you have me do? What do we make? Teach me as if I were a bird and you a very patient cat.”

“First episode,” Marta said, her voice brightening as if someone had turned up a dial. “We film your hands, not your face. You hum like you do when you’re mending sandals, the one you think nobody hears. We show a thread moving. We loop it. We make a joke about thread. We maybe tell about the Porcellino. You never say blood. We say red, maybe. We don’t even say red if you don’t want. We say ‘spicy color’. I think people want to hear a hand remember itself. And we can point folks to other hands in the world. We make a braid of small things.”

“Spicy color?” Livia laughed, that unexpected bark again. “You absolute dog.”

“I am,” Marta said, relieved also, and then, because when you love someone you pounce at the first opening, reached across and took Livia’s hand. “Only if you want. Only if you don’t feel owned by it. I don’t want to own you.”

“In this house,” Livia said, “nobody owns anybody.”

“Right,” Marta said. Then: “So. We try?”

Livia looked past her to the door, beyond it to the yard, beyond the yard to the city that washed itself at evening in warm gold. The Arno turned to glass. The pigeons said stupid things to each other. The bells of Santo Spirito had a cough tonight. In the street, a boy practiced a trumpet badly. The sound sure of itself in an uncertain way.

“Okay,” she said. “We try. Not because I believe. Because I want to.”

Marta’s face lit. It was the cheapest energy source in the world. “We can practice now. If you don’t run away. I have lights. I rigged something with the old lamp and a paper bag. I’m a genius. You’ll be so impressed. Or you’ll laugh and then we’ll still eat pasta.”

“Pasta and thread,” Livia said. “What is life.”

But when night came down one button at a time and the paper bag lantern glowed with whatever tiny stars it had, when Marta held up the phone and frowned in concentration in a way that looked like prayer, when Livia put her hands into the frame and watched them become an image on a small screen, she did not feel eaten. She felt like a person in a story, which is to say she felt both real and adjacent to reality in the right measure. She hummed. She forgot to be careful for eight seconds and then for nineteen. At the end of it, the video was a minute long.

“What do we call it?” Marta whispered. She whispered though there was nobody here to hear except for the house and the ferns.

“I don’t know,” Livia whispered back, and then: “The Bettering. No. That’s wrong. Too proud. The Slightly Bettering. The Tiny Rehearsal.”

“The Small Voice,” Marta said. “Or Small Repair.”

“Small Repair,” Livia repeated, tasting it. “Yes. It is a little cleat on a ship. It holds a rope. It is not the rope and not the ship. Yeah.”

“You keep saying yeah,” Marta said, and they both giggled.

They uploaded it at midnight because midnight felt like a place where nobody could object. Somewhere on the other side of town, a cat knocked over a jar as if on cue. Someone in another country couldn’t sleep and found it. Someone in this town fell asleep to a hum that was not their mother’s and woke up better.

The next morning, Livia put on a brave face to go to the fig tree and be trapped under tables by queens, and the morning after that she handled three paper cuts at once and didn’t wobble, and the morning after that she saw the thumbnail of her own hands on Marta’s phone and felt a strange warm stone click into place in her chest; not an end, a beginning. It would not be easy, and not everybody was going to like any of this, and somebody was going to say she was making a cheap spectacle of the city’s work, and somebody else would say the work did not even exist and was all fairy stories. But for now there was coffee, and a ribbon that bit her less, and a sister who made of a small glowing rectangle a small glowing candle, and a city with old stones willing to listen. For now she didn’t fall. For now she went forward.By morning the video had drawn ten strangers into the kitchen without bringing their bodies. They had left small notes like folded bits of paper: thank you, I heard the sound of the thread and my chest remembered how to do that; my grandmother used to hum that pattern; what is the name of the knot near the end. Marta leaned her hip against the counter and read aloud with an air of barely contained triumph, as if she had smuggled home a flock of birds and was desperate not to startle them. Livia held her cup in both hands and let the words lap at her. The idea that somewhere someone had fallen asleep to her humming made her feel like a bridge that had dared two banks to remain in conversation.

“We shouldn’t say names,” Livia said finally. “Or show the kitchen tiles. People know those tiles. They belong to a retired baker who comes to play cards with Papa on Thursdays. He will see his tiles and declare that we have stolen the very floor.”

“I masked the edge of the sink,” Marta said. “And I put the phone on airplane mode, like a peasant who thinks lightning hides in metal. It’s hands only, and sound, and the lamp bag makes everything look like a cloud. We can shoot under the table next time to honor your queen.” She waggled her eyebrows. “Also, two people asked about the thread. They want to know where to buy thread like that. If we ever need money to buy towels we could sell two meter bundles of blessed string and call it art.”

“You are shameless,” Livia said, and the word felt fond in her mouth. “Do not sell our towels.”

She wore the ribbon and let it lie flat today, a truce negotiated between impulse and intention. On the walk to the fig tree she named colors under her breath like a child reciting a catechism: copper, persimmon, terracotta, paprika, sunrise inside the shell of an egg when you hold it to a candle. When the old ones set out their props—coils and vials and a butcher’s paper parcel the size of a palm—she remembered all at once that she was also an animal, equipped with lungs and a tongue and a stubborn little stone of will lodged under the left rib. The rosemary smelled like both saints and Sunday roast. She attended to that and not to the wet. When Zita tipped wine into a shallow dish so it spread with the soft greed of a lake, Livia looked at the way the meniscus clung to the metal and told herself a story about surface tension learning to be brave and then letting go.

“There,” said Queen Smeralda, who believed in the efficacy of naming after the doing and not before. “You touched the edge and it did not singe you. Come again. Again.” They paced her as if she were a runner learning to take a hill. They did not coddle. They did not tease. They did not make this an entertainment. Old Bastiano placed a seed in his mouth and rolled it between tongue and palate for no reason Livia could see except that old men sometimes need a small round thing to think with. Benedetta told a long story about the time a cousin of hers mistook nail varnish for medicine and had to be wrestled from the bright bottle. They kept her body in the room until her body believed it belonged there.

Afterward, the city requested errands the way a cat requests a lap: insistently and then with disdain for its own need. A printmaker near Santa Maria Novella had a blade go sideways and took a neat bite out of his finger; the ink and the iron both told Livia to sit down, but she leaned into the plant world instead, breathed linseed and cotton rag and the ridiculous vanity of a poster for a band that had broken up three years ago. Ghita wrapped and murmured and made of it a lesson about thumb placement. They stopped at the cobbler’s to retrieve sandals and left behind instead a conversation about how stitches are made to be temporary even when we call them permanent. They coaxed a swarm of midges out of a child’s hair with a spell and a handful of lavender thrown like confetti. A day can be made entirely of small hands and still feel like a day that mattered.

It was not all mercy. In the afternoon a message arrived folded into an empty detergents box outside the greengrocer’s, which was how Benedetta preferred to run her intrigues. The words had been written with the kind of pencil that only nuns buy, the line heavy and without laughter: do not show the work. you forget what the world does with its eyes. it eats. Ghita read it while Livia watched a pigeon bath in gutter water with the seriousness of a monk at a font. “She means well,” Ghita said, and then added, as if to iron out the sting, “She has seen things we have not. But she forgets that hiding makes its own monsters, and the children build religions out of the dark.” She tucked the note away for kindling. “We will speak with the queen after the Righting. For now, keep the videos soft.”

Marta took criticism like a swallow takes a gale: she wobbled and then corrected mid-flight. “We can make the place be nowhere,” she said, spreading her fingers over her phone as if to muffle any clues the device might be spilling. “Close-ups only, nothing but hands, no spoken place names, no Porcellino, no bridge names, no bells that students of ethnomusicology can triangulate. We can make every sound a ghost of its source. Look.” She pulled up the second episode as if conjuring a coin from behind Livia’s ear. It was a loop of a button being warmed by a palm and then eased toward a coat that had lost its button weeks ago and been pretending that did not matter. The voice said nothing for ten seconds and then said, very low, “we pretend, we remember, we return,” in a rhythm that belonged more to knitting needles than to speech. It found Livia’s spine and moved through as if polite.

“What if someone notices my ring,” Livia said suddenly. “It has my mother’s nick in it. She used to take her ring off to knead dough and once it fell on the floor and made a small moon on a night when my father had thought there were no moons left. He keeps that nick in the stories. Someone will know the nick and arrive at our door with a story and a knife.”

“Then they find us, and if they are ours they join, and if they are not, they receive coffee on the step and we practice saying no with our soft voices,” Marta said, patting the air as if smoothing ruffled napkins. “I will blur the ring. I will put a lemon in front of it and call it lemon art. I am not an amateur. I am an over-cautious rag in the machinery. Trust me, topolino. If it becomes too large we cut it at the stem.”

The queen did not wait for the Righting to exercise her right to an opinion. Livia found herself once more under the fig tree with a semicircle of decision-makers and a number of cats pretending to be indifferent. Queen Smeralda’s brooch caught the light and sent it in a tight green beam into Livia’s eye, which felt like a trial by optics. “You have made a sound in the air,” the queen said, not asking and yet asking. “It is not a wrong sound. But since our grandmothers braided invisible into their hair and told us to leave our footsteps soft, we have kept certain tender things behind glass. We will not pound hammers to glass because we are tired. We will only slide the lid open when it is necessary to air the objects.”

“It was for practice, Maestà,” Livia said, her mouth remembering how to be formal. “For me to be inside my hands longer than frightened usually allows. It was a game invented by my sister that is not a child’s. We do not say what we do is what we do. We say this is a sound that reminds you that you have hands.”

Zita gave the air the tiniest of thumbs-up, which coming from her was a harbinger of thunder. “If the people want a lullaby for their hands, let them have it,” she muttered. “But do not show them the proper oil. I have been asked at least ten times what I rub into soles to keep them from cracking and I tell them olive oil and watch them discover the dark stain under their feet. Let them learn by error. Let them learn that not everything belongs.”

“We agree to conditions,” the queen said, as if responding to a suggestion that had not been voiced. “You will blur the ring. You will cut the corners off the places. You will not say ritual. You will not say cure. You will keep the tools ordinary. Should a human with bright teeth and a camera come sniffing under our table, you will offer them pasta and send them along to film their own dentist. If the channel grows to a forest, we will lop branches. We are not coins in other people’s mouths.”

“We accept,” Marta said, stepping forward because sometimes the human needs to take the stone on her feet and throw it. “The channel will be small and hard to find and sweet and the strangers who arrive will be mostly tired and good. We will make nothing that cannot be explained as one person being careful for another. If it ever asks to be larger than our kitchen, we will let it go back into the pocket where we found it.”

They were released with the feeling of having been allowed to keep a toy that could be made into a sword if mishandled. The fig tree rattled its leaves as if applauding a compromise that meant more work for everyone. Livia exhaled into her collar and found her ribbon damp. Piero waited outside the boundary like a boy who had promised to stay on the step and then had put one foot over because a challenge is a challenge. He had a bruise under his eye in the color of figs left a day too long. “You look like bread that was almost burned and then saved,” he said. “The queen will eat that channel if it grows teeth.”

“It is a candle,” Marta said, bored by hyperbole. “If it gutters, we pinch it. If it drips, we wipe the table. If it flares, we take it into the yard. When did you fight, and why do you look proud.”

“I fought the olive tree and lost,” Piero said. “And I am proud because it means the olive tree wanted me. Come tonight. There is a thing under the Uffizi that is making the statues swear. Some American men brought a drone and the drone made a noise like a mosquito that studied law. The birds are outraged. The marble is sulking. It is a small breakage we can practice mending, Livia. No oceans of iron. No bandits. Only feathers and dignity.”

Dignity proves harder to repair than flesh on most days, but they went. Evening piled itself on the roofs like folded cloth, and the corridors of the Uffizi had those flickers that come from a hundred cameras and a handful of centuries. The drone had a red strap and a stripe of LED brightness like a lizard with opinions. The men flew it close to faces no hand had touched in a long time, and the pigeons took it personally and flocked and fledged in a way that was halfway between glory and farce. Livia felt the color of the strap with that nausea that sometimes came in on a side street and then thought instead about saffron threads in the rice bowl at home; she conjured the smell of it, hay and sunlight and somewhere else. She found a handful of yellow floss in her bag, because she had begun carrying small sunshine on purpose, and to Piero’s astonishment stood under the loggia and flicked the floss in a pattern that birds understand if they want to. Pigeons are perverse. Tonight they wanted to. The swarm bent, reconsidered, and went to sit on a roof where a grandmother statue could scold them into calm.

The drone men swore in a glamorous language that was a cousin of money and were so intent on their failure that one of them walked into a bench hard enough to graze his knee. He reached by reflex, discovered blood in a pale elegant smear, and made the face of a person who feels that the world has singled him out for petty torment. Livia felt the old tilt and made of it a boat. She put her knuckles on the stone of the bench because the stone did not care and has never cared. She said, “I have clean wipes,” which was true, and “salt water,” which was true, and “we can clean that,” which was true in more ways than one. She held out the wipe and a string of anonymous advice about pressure and waited while the man chose between pride and relief. He let her have the knee. It was pink and human and silly, and when the tiny fluid of salt and the hum of her mouth met the skin, it behaved. She did not wobble. She named the red spicy, and the spicy sat in a jar and not in her eyes.

“There,” Piero said later, when the men had gone to complain to a bartender and the drone had been tucked in a case like a guilty child. “Small breakage. Small repair. Why do we sometimes pretend we want only large victories. The small ones are the breadcrumb trail home.”

Marta had filmed a brake squeal and a wingbeat and Livia’s hand near a stone, and none of it showed a face. She tucked her phone away with that care she had been practicing, which was the opposite of the drag-and-drop carelessness that had made the city bristle on bad days. “Episode four,” she said, and when Livia glanced at her she flinched just enough to confess she had been counting. “Episode three is the buttons. Episode four is feathers and benches and the sound of a throat before a laugh. It will make someone in a city where there are no pigeons feel like they have a lap full of birds.”

The days arranged themselves as if they had been braided by an elderly aunt: tight, sensible, with occasional flamboyant turns. Livia found that when she sat down in the kitchen each morning part of her wanted to ask the glowing rectangle what it had heard in the night, which frightened her, because she did not want to trade one hungry god for another. She let Marta be the priestess, which suited them both. The comments did what comments do; they were tender and odd and once in a while cruel, but even the cruelty seemed soft, bored, the kind of unoriginal malice that slides off a surface if the surface knows its own name. One message was not like the others. It arrived in a vocabulary that had dust on it. There was no profile picture, only a blue letter. it is a braid, wrote the sender, in Italian so stilted it might have been translated twice. i knew a woman who hummed like that in via maggio during a winter when the bread went hard on the outside because the bakery refused to know how to wait. she put her hands on a table and made it think it was another thing for a while. say my name once if you are the daughters and then do not reply. The name that followed was a river stone of a word, old-Florentine, ending in -uccia. Livia’s wrist moved on its own to touch her ribbon.

“She’s from that side,” she told Marta, though in her gut it was less a certainty than a sense of returning gravity. “Don’t answer. We are not an altar. We are a radio that plays lullabies and then goes to sleep.”

At home, the father carved a hand that would hold a book and swore that wood was trickster matter. He sanded until his own palm turned to a map. “This hand knows more than I do,” he said. “It keeps wanting to turn toward something I did not ask it to. Maybe it misses the book that used to sit there. Maybe everything made remembers its origin and resents being reminded of other tasks.” He lifted the piece so it caught dust in a shaft of light and shook his head at the beauty of what had no brain. “Tie your ribbon on her,” he said then, without looking up. “Make the hand brave. Then you can take it back. Courage has a long shelf life.”

Livia knotted the ribbon around the wrist of the wooden hand and felt ridiculous and felt right. The wood held still for the knot in a way that made her wonder whether the world coordinates with us when we decide to be foolish on purpose. She kept the ribbon there until the following morning, when she woke to find a pale narrow green strip laid on her pillow like a promise. It had lived in the trunk where her mother’s other little instruments slept. Marta had gone into that trunk with the reverence of a thief and come back out with a new talisman that did not bite. “You can be loyal to two things at once,” she said. “To what was and to what will be. Nobody forbade extra ribbons.”

Between practice under table and practice under sky the Righting approached like a holiday nobody could quite name. The candles are always too many. The air in the place where they do it lifts the hair on the forearms of anyone with nerves receptive enough to read a map printed on water. They do not advertise. The city sends the ones who need sending by means the city knows—an overheard remark in a bakery, a text sent to the wrong number that turns out right, a toddler who points, a curtain that moves when no window is open. The work is to sing and to knot and to coax and to carry and to breathe in a tempo that persuades certain locks to sit back in their grooves. Livia had never enjoyed the heat. She had always loved the moment the wicks leaned into being lit and disliked everything that came after. This year the queen slid a small bundle of beeswax toward her and said, “You keep the breath. You keep it in your hands and you hand it along. Don’t look at the ones who fall. Other hands will hold them up. You pretend the air is made of bread.”

“Bread air,” Piero said behind her, and received a pinch for his pains. “I’m lightening the room. My job,” he muttered. “I’m the man with the eyebrows at the gelato cart of ceremonies.”

Marta wanted the sound of the first long exhale, the one the room makes as if it were a person who has climbed stairs and then discovered the rest of the evening is dancing. She begged with devotion and with an understanding of lines. “I won’t show anything,” she told the queen. “Only the sigh. A piece of it. For my archive. For the people who have to do these Rightings alone, in places without figs and with bad chairs.”

“We do this once,” said the queen, counting the risk like coins. “You keep it in a box marked private and a second box marked pieri will steal this if he can. If you show it to the world I will hang your phone from the Ponte with a ribbon and we will all clap.”

The sky took the hint and promised rain by piling clouds the way bakers pile sheets of dough. The Arno swelled a little and then winked; it had seen worse and lifted its skirts accordingly. In the Boboli, somewhere, a boy hid a bottle and imagined being discovered and adored. In the market, a woman sold peaches she had perfumed with nostalgia and cracked her knuckles in between sales in a rhythm that suggested she had once been a drummer. In the house, the pomegranates considered their own calendars. The city almost purred.

On the morning of the Righting, the gelato boy finally told them his name because he had not yet and to do otherwise is to unbalance any story. “Enzo,” he said, handing over pistachio so perfect it might have been a tile from a more patient city. “You come always when it is not too hot and not too cold. You are studying my eyebrows with disrespect.”

“We are scholars of eyebrows,” Piero said solemnly. “We have a grant.”

Enzo laughed and looked at Marta the way boys with decent hearts look at girls who rearrange the visible world with their thumbs. Livia watched the look arrive and then pass through the space between two women who had decided to be sisters with the ease of a basket carried by two hands. Jealousy does not arrive everywhere at once, and today it did not arrive in that courtyard. The sweetness was a clean sweetness. They ate and went home. Signora Corradi had arranged the tablecloth twice and then a third time, because when the world makes ready to be shifted, mothers cannot keep their hands still.

The Righting itself is a thing stories do not enjoy describing because the parts that matter most look like nothing much. A room, a rope braided through a dozen palms, a song that never learned its own name, a handful of keys and no locks, a queen who does not raise her voice, a boy who cannot stand enclosed spaces walking to a wall and touching it and not fainting. Livia kept the breath like she had been told. She felt it form in her cupped hands like the beginning of a moth and she gave it to the next person and to the next. When a woman’s knees buckled three people agreed silently to be her chair and they were. When the candles guttered the room set its shoulders and made a wind with mouths only and it solved that. When the sound of iron threatened to name itself, Livia found the smell of saffron again and she did not leave. She thought once about the Small Repair channel and the voices of the sleepy strangers and about the way a hum can cross a country without a passport and bring someone a screenful of kitchen light. She thought once about the ribbon on the hand of the wooden carved angel and about the green strip waiting in her drawer, and in between those thoughts she did the instructed things. Afterward, a grandmother she had never met squeezed her wrist with a pressure that would bruise and then removed her fingers as if the wrist belonged to a museum exhibit. Thank you, the gesture said. We did not drown tonight.

Rain began outside as they blew the last little auroras from the wicks. It hit the city in a pattern so familiar that three different old men took naps on three different couches at exactly the same instant. Queen Smeralda took Marta’s phone in one hand and produced a tiny carved key from somewhere behind her ear with the other. She opened the box inside the phone where the sound hides and took out exactly eleven seconds and put them in her pocket. “When you are old,” she said, “I will give this back to you.” It did not feel like theft. It felt like thrift.

The day after the Righting, a one-eyed stone lion near the Bargello wept rust and an influencer with a red hat filmed it and called it a sign. Livia stood and watched as tourists made meaning at a statue’s expense and felt tired in her bones with a tiredness that had nothing to do with candles. She wanted a week of being nobody’s necessary thing. She wanted to sit underneath the pomegranate tree and memorize the exact shape of the shade. She rubbed her thumb across her ring. On the phone, the comments continued like rain in a different country, gentle, sometimes insistent, sometimes a deluge.

In the afternoon, Signora Corradi found a shoebox in a cupboard that should have contained ribbons and instead contained the opposite of a ribbon: a sheaf of letters that her mother had kept from years before there were phones strapped to every wrist. The letters had been written in a hand that copied its capital Fs from a music teacher and its capital As from a train schedule. They were from Anna Teresa to Murmur, which is to say from the mother they had in common to the father who had taught Livia how to carve a potato into a stamp. The child reading the parent is a hazard. Livia sat on the floor and read. There were many ordinary things: the price of oranges, the way a seam came out crooked and nobody at the party noticed, the cat that refused to admit it had learned a new trick. There were also pieces of a person who had known fear and refused to be eaten by the word. i do not love narrow places, wrote Anna Teresa, and then added a compromise in the following line, i love wells when i climb them though. she had drawn a cartoon of a table with legs like men and written under it, practice, fools, practice until you are bored of being afraid. Livia put her forehead on her knees and laughed without sound. Some inheritances are debts that you do want to pay.

The channel did not stay small in the way the queen would have preferred; no song stays small if it learns to walk. It reached a woman in Buenos Aires who had a son who would not go to school because he kept seeing the corners where things could go wrong, and it reached a man in Palermo who wrote long letters to his couch, and it reached a girl in Ljubljana who saved her money to buy a microphone so that the sound of a spoon in a bowl could be louder and then discovered that she did not want loudness. For a time it was unfindable. For a time it was easy. Then one evening a large account that made videos about sleep without respect for the old gods of sleep linked them as an example of good fencing against the night. The number at the top of the page did the strange multiplication that is both sugar and salt. Benedetta sent another note in another soap box; this time the handwriting carved cycles into the paper. the eyes are coming fast now, she wrote. this is a river. remember how to swim. remember the stones. remember we do not drown for other people’s entertainments.

Marta put her phone face down and rubbed her hair dry with a towel that was not wet. “We can close it,” she said. “It is a door. Doors are not gods. They open and close because we say so. If you blink and see red in the place of thread even once more than you can tolerate, we close. If the queen frowns with her top teeth, we close. If I become a ghoul apartment that eats sleep and shits envy, we close and I will take up basket weaving. I will become extremely specialized in baskets for lemons.”

Livia didn’t answer at once because sometimes the decision is a creature you have to let emerge from a hole in the ground at its own pace. The city outside chose that moment to perform one of its increasingly common insults—a scooter and a car and a bus and a pedestrian choreography that resulted in shouts about mothers and the lineage of donkeys. She looked at her step-sister and remembered the moment under the paper bag lamp. She remembered the gelato boy’s eyebrows. She remembered a boy with a knee that had leaked a little and then decided not to. “We do not close,” she said at last. “We change rhythm. We make it a weekly thing, not a daily thing. We name the days. We call it Wednesday Braids. We do a series on things that are not red and also still brave. We make a video of the sound of bread being torn and we tell nobody it is for the queen. We do one episode about how to sit on the floor and breathe when the room is too full. We keep the ring blurry. We wear the green ribbon for filming so that I remember choices. If I hate it in a month we shut the door and put chalk across the threshold.”

“Wednesday Braids,” Marta said, tasting it the way she had tasted pistachio. “We are ridiculous. The ridiculous is a glue. It makes things hold that have no business holding.”

The next week, in the workshop near the Baptistery, a glassblower named Federico let his pipe touch a thing that should not have been hot and hissed and swore and then laughed as if shocked by his own pain. Ghita wrapped and Livia dabbed and the color in the blister was barely there and yet her ears tried to convince her the room had turned to soup. She pressed her tongue to the roof of her mouth and counted backwards in odd numbers and thought of the glass shifting state: neither liquid nor solid, a stubborn intermediary like any creature that refuses categories. Federico told a story about his grandfather who had blown a saint’s foot in the wrong size and had to hide it in a barrel. They made a video that night of bubbles in water catching light and they called it Practice.

Things collected behind the practice like witnesses. Piero brought them a ball of twine he said had once tied together a crate of oranges from Sicily that tasted like sorrow. The queen sent a small packet of salt with a leaf of instructions folded into it that said hold this in your pocket when you walk by the place where the river remembers being red. A skeleton of a fish appeared on the doorstep one dawn, too carefully arranged to be chance, each bone like a letter. Livia and Marta swept it into the garden and buried it and planted basil on top, because there are ways to pretend you have not received a message that still count as acknowledging it.

One night, when the air had that particular texture that says storms will be arrogant and brief, a tourist with a scarf the color of new roses fainted cleanly at the sight of his own blood from a shaving nick he had been poking as if to make sure it still had ambitions. He went down like a curtain. Livia was there by accident and then on purpose. She put his shoulders into a shape. She told a busy body not to splash water on his face. She watched the red, named it, put it in its jar, and let the world unclench. The scarf lay on the ground and she picked it up and felt the temptation to make it into a snake and also into a joke. She folded it and kept it safe until the man remembered his name. He took it back with a sheepish thank you and she realized that the ribbon on her own wrist had not bitten once that day.

It would be false to pretend that with practice terror stops finding doorknobs. It is a good locksmith. It arrives at noon sometimes with a picnic basket and makes the bread smell strange. It takes you by the elbow when you are carrying too many plates and it forces you to drop them. It is impolite. But the work of naming and of humming and of lending your hands to the job of breath makes a difference the way a second person on a see-saw makes the game possible. The queen’s under-table exercise continued until Livia knew the pattern of the woodgrain better than her own palm. The channel’s voice lowered and slowed and learned to leave more silence than sound. The city endured and occasionally applauded them by letting a bus be on time and a neighbor who had been impossible become possible for a minute.

At the end of that month, under a sky the color of postcards, Livia dreamt of her mother. It was not a postcard dream; it felt like a tool placed deliberately on a table. Her mother was making a ribbon of light with her hands and laughing at the way it refused to allow itself to be tied. She stood with her back to a well and threw looks over her shoulder at it with the casual ferocity of women who have memorized depths. She said, practice until you are bored, and then make a joke, and then practice again. She put the light down and it became a loaf, and she tore it and gave it to Livia and to someone whose face Livia could not see and said, eat, piglet, or you will gnaw your own wrists. Livia woke with hunger and went to the kitchen where Marta had left a note that said pasta under the blue pot, heat as much as you forgive me and then heat more. She ate and felt the city grow into its night self around her, bells giving themselves small permissions, pines whispering to the bats that cut their signatures into dark. The ribbon lay on the table blowing in a breeze that did not exist, as if someone had just left the room. She tied it back on without making it a promise this time. She made it a companion. She drank water and tasted saffron where there was none. The room approved. It had been waiting for her to notice it was on her side.The city the morning after the Righting moved with the loose-limbed caution of someone who had danced too late and made peace with it. Wires hummed, pigeons rehearsed their arguments in softer voices, and the Arno nosed at its embankments like a dog searching for the one square of shade that remembers its name. Livia woke with the particular ache that comes from having lent pieces of yourself to a room and then retrieved them, not all in the same shape. Her ribbon lay on her wrist in a temper she could live with. The green strip Marta had given her waited coiled in the saucer where they kept screws that no longer corresponded to any known hinge. The house smelled of toast and of the shy-sour scent of blown-out candles clinging to hair.

They had decided on Wednesdays, which have always been honest days, to do the braiding. Marta had painted a square of cardboard with a circle of pale lemon to place beneath the lamp so the light would take instruction instead of throwing tantrums. “We give Wednesday a job,” she said, poking the day on the calendar as if to pin it to the corkboard. “If a day does not have a job, it becomes a critic.” Livia ate her bread in small careful bites and let herself believe in the ridiculous safety of rituals that do no harm. Piero sent a message with nine lemons for no reason and a caption that read you cannot be sad if you are inside a market stall, which was empirically untrue and also persuasive.

On Via Maggio, the bookbinder’s door had taken to sticking in the mornings, a fact that would have concerned nobody if a certain folded paper had not slid beneath it carrying an address and a time and a name that ended the way old women end names they intend to keep soft. The script had that old-Florentine humpback to it, leaning forward as if driven by a city that refused to walk at any pace but its own. i will be at the bindery with the shutters half down, it read. i hum when nervous. if you are the daughters, bring a spool. do not bring an audience. The spool requirement felt like a test you could fail without understanding the grading rubric. Livia took the thread that had sat on the table during the first Small Repair and held it in her mouth while she tied her shoes as if to remind her body that her voice and her feet belonged to the same creature.

It was Rificolona week, when children build paper moons and mothers pretend not to see which children intend to burn those moons for the sport of it. The lanterns are saints and sinners both; they glow, they drip, they flee the sticks that poke them, and they weep wax like contrite pears. Ghita, who never trusted a holiday, appeared at the door with a coil of cotton and a jar with a ribbon of water wobbling at its top edge. “Annunziata will be chaos,” she said, hooking a thumb toward the north, where the piazza had already begun to look like a camp for cheerful refugees. “We are there with a pocket for burned fingers and a song for children who mistake mischief for destiny. Bring yellow. Bring bluntness. Leave your complication for afterward.”

They went first to Via Maggio, because a summons with a nickname at the end comes with a weight you cannot fob off onto next week. The bindery smelled of cloth and glue and the particular ecclesiastical dust that books accumulate when they pretend to be altars. Shutters half-down meant they could see the shoes of the people going by and not their faces, which felt like a mercy on a morning when Livia did not want to be mirrored back at by strangers. The woman at the long table wore a cardigan the color of eggplant skins and a ring that looked like it had been filed out of a coin. She did hum when nervous, a narrow tune shaped for passing between teeth. When she saw the spool she stopped humming and put both hands flat on the table as if to greet another pair of hands now that conversation had begun.

“You are Murmur’s child,” she said without greeting and without pleading. “You are Anna Teresa’s question. You have your father’s skeptical thumbs and your mother’s way of looking at a thing by narrowing one eye so that the thing understands it is being asked to behave. I am Mariuccia if this helps you, which it may not, and I am not here to tell you secrets that are not mine to tell. I am here to tell you that the fear you borrow is not antique, it is mint, it is always brand new, and your mother spent a winter learning to talk it down from fences. She tied a green ribbon because she tired of the red one biting. She used saffron as a ladder because the flood had taken away all the other steps.”

“The flood,” Livia said, and the word did not need a year attached to it because in this city it wears its century like a coat that never goes out of fashion. “I know the stories, and the pictures in the archives with volunteers dragging saints out of the mud like fishermen with a stubborn catch. I did not know she—” She stopped because the not-knowing felt like rudeness at a family table.

“In the winter after the river tried to eat our libraries, your mother and I and three others stood in rooms that smelled like a butcher’s shop and a church had been asked to marry, and we turned pages with gloves and we told paper that it was still allowed to be paper,” said Mariuccia in the flat tone of someone listing the groceries she had forgotten. “The men with big names and big wallets were very busy remembering themselves, and somebody had to hum so the room did not forget its scale. Your mother would not enter a closet alone because the flood had put doors into conversation with terror, but she climbed wells because we asked her to and she swore at us and then said thank you. She had a spool like that one. It is not magic when I say that. It is familiarity. The spool knows what hands want,” she added, putting her finger on the thread as if to remind it of its obligations.

Marta, who had come along because the boundary between family and kitchen and invitation is a softer thing than law, kept herself as quiet as a person can keep herself when she suspects she is sitting inside the shape of a person she did not get to meet alive. She looked at the woman’s ring and did not ask how old Florentine women learned to stare down entire cities. “The channel reached you,” she said, which in any other room would have sounded like boasting, and here sounded like a question about the plumbing.

“Something reached me,” said Mariuccia, not ungentle. “The sound of a spool rolling across a table the way a thought rolls when it tires of sitting upright, perhaps. I do not look at screens. I have granddaughters who have screens and they arrange their hair like astronomers arrange their telescopes and they do not take my calls, and yet they call the cousins of their own accord. The world circles back to itself in forms we do not like and we must keep the parts that serve us and ignore the chorus that sings hunger. You do what you want with your singing. You do not ask me permission. You do not ask the queen either if you already know your answer.”

“We have chosen to make the channel quiet and specific and to count our breaths between episodes,” Marta said, and the words sounded as if she were reporting the state of the tide. “We do not show faces. We do not say bishop or benediction. We do not call a repair a miracle. We are threading a needle that may not exist and we are doing it in public, which is not a thing I advise, except that I cannot stop myself.”

“Then it is as it has always been,” said Mariuccia, and she smiled in a way that belonged to someone who had once dared to take a saint’s shoe and turn it into a paperweight. “What did you bring me besides thread.”

“Questions,” Livia said, but she lifted the spool and placed it in the older woman’s palm because a hand that extends itself in that shape deserves to be met. “And one more thing. What do we do when people like to watch us more than we like to be watched.”

“You build a little theater and you charge admission in buttons and you seat the people who are good at being quiet up front and you put the ones with sharp mouths in the back near the door so the city can swallow them if it grows tired,” said the woman with a briskness that made Marta’s shoulders drop as if relieved to receive instructions, even ridiculous ones. “And when the lanterns burn tonight, which they always do because children are not careful and their little blood does not yet know how to hide, you put your back to the church wall and you take your green ribbon and you put it in your mouth and you listen for the part of your head that is not foolish. It will tell you who is yours and who is for somebody else. That is the only answer. Your mother would have said it less kindly and she would have added that if you faint you must at least faint with style.”

They went to Annunziata with their pockets full of contradictory advice and their shoes clean because clean shoes make you feel as if you have done half your work already. The piazza had dressed for misrule, lamp-lit and shadow-lipped, the colonnade watching with its ancient blank interest while paper fish and stars and improbable angels bumped one another and bobbed on sticks. Children marched with the solemnity peculiar to children pretending to be saints while wanting to be pirates, and teenagers poked holes in lanterns and giggled as wax sighed onto wrists. The air was full of cheap wax and lilies and fried dough and the sound of someone playing a recorder badly and without apology. Livia felt her skin brace for a red she did not expect here and then corrected herself with almost-annoyance at her own mind. Fire has its own tyrannies. Tonight she would court only them.

Ghita set up shop with the indifference of a general pitching a tent. She put a kettle in a corner that did not have a plug and made it boil anyway because that is a trick old women learn to save their patience. “We are a station of ordinary kindness,” she told the first mother who came with a child who had dripped a river of candle-wax onto a thumb and then negotiated pain by howling in a scale that suggested a career in opera if properly coached. “Make room for the next one when your tears get bored.” The mother laughed in spite of herself. Livia smiled with most of her face and handed over a cloth cooled by a whisper to pretend it had been in a stream. Piero turned up with a sack of bread ends and turned half the children into ducklings by the simple expedient of handing out crusts like prizes.

It is possible to tell the shape of a trouble by the sound the crowd makes just before the trouble knows itself. The recorder hiccupped, the fried dough woman swore a prayer, and the lanterns moved as a school of fish does when something large moves in their water. A string of lanterns that had been tied for prettiness and then hauled higher than any person could reach took the notion to slide. The cord hissed through a pulley as if reminding the humans who tied it that gravity had signed the original social contract. It came down in a long slow bow that became a quick mean droop. A father reached. A boy shrieked because boys sometimes want to be part of stories they will not like to tell. A flame kissed paper and then its cousins, and in the second before sensible feet could step and sensible breaths be counted, a scarf learned how to be a torch.

Present danger is cleaner than imagined danger, and Livia surprised herself by feeling not soup but clarity. She saw the spoon-shape of the square, she saw the slope of heads, she saw the point where running would cause a bottleneck and the point where standing still would be a stupidity. “There,” she said to Piero, pointing with two fingers the way their aunt had taught them because some directions are spells. “Pull that line down. Not the other. You’ll flood the saints.” He did not pretend not to hear. He did the thing. A knot refused to listen to him and he swore at it and the knot pretended to consider and then obliged. The lanterns swung. Two went out with the grudging sizzle candles produce when corrected by a superior. One fell at the feet of a girl in a scarf and she froze in the shape of a dancer about to bow.

Ghita took the worst burn, because of course she did; a wash of wax on the inside of the wrist where age has tenderized the skin. She did not react with anything so gauche as a yelp, but the tightening around her mouth told Livia what she needed to know. The old woman kept her hand still while her other hand reached to a boy who had suffered a bright crescent on his forearm and she muttered the exact sort of blasphemy that convinces saints to intervene. “You,” she said to Livia, and this you held a quart of trust and a cup of order. “Swap me. Right now. And if you feel the room slanting, remember saffron, remember bread, remember nothing.”

Livia took the place that had been kept warm for her by her aunt’s competence and her own terror. The mother with the operatic child brought forward another child who had willed bravery into existence and succeeded only in blistering part of a palm. The teenager who had done the poking came forward with the strut bled out of her and held out a red dot on her knuckle like an apology. The man with the scarf torch had singed his cuff and pretended he had done it on purpose, but his fingers shook. The world smelled like wax and a little hair and the sweet panic of flour. Livia held a wrist in her left hand and a cloth in her right and spoke to the cloth as if it were a student. She did not look for red and when it arrived she labeled it spicy and told it to sit in its jar and not to bother the adults. She put a thumb on a pulse and told it it was not an alarm clock. She tucked a corner of calm under a child’s elbow like a napkin.

Marta had lifted her phone by reflex and then lowered it, and the lowering was an act as clean as the lifting had been greedy. She stood with her shoulder pressed to the wall and let her body be barn and lamppost and kitchen door for anyone who needed to lean. When a small boy walked into her hip at speed because his eyes had not yet learned to steer his feet, she took his forehead and put it to her mouth in the universal idiotic not-medicine of human beings and it worked because attention often does. She cut strips from her scarf because some sacrifices are allowed even in a world where paper is precious. She looked at Piero, who had the rope in his mouth like a dog who believed himself a horse, and she laughed, and the laugh turned the square back toward human and away from spectacle.

In the midst of it, a man went down near the fountain from a simple thing—a cut at the ankle from a piece of decoration half-hidden under drooped flowers—and because he was older and because the ankle argues with the rest of the body more loudly than other parts, his blood made ambition. Livia saw him and felt the old tilt arrive with its polished shoes and its little talk about gravity. She could have forced herself toward him and perhaps she would have stayed upright, and perhaps she would have made herself a martyr to her own stubbornness, and perhaps she would have found herself on the stones looking up at the cracked sky. She did not take him for herself. She lifted her chin and looked for Ghita’s eyes and found them and made the small head movement that means I am not the right knife for that bread. Ghita’s mouth softened even as she hissed when her sleeve brushed her own burn, and she nodded and angled herself toward the man with the ankle as if she had been there all along.

By the time the lanterns had decided to behave and the recorder player had found a scale that did him no shame and the piazza had scolded itself back into its normal immodest cheer, Livia’s collar was damp and her palms were camphor and her muscles had done that thing where they pretend they are stone until they realize you are looking and then turn back into animals. Ghita let a breath out in a manner that suggested she would have words later with the pulley, the rope, the city, and perhaps God, if He was taking messages. “Well enough,” she said, and the words were heavy coin. “I did not want the wax, but the wax did not want me either, so we are even.”

Queen Smeralda materialized from the colonnade with the inevitability of bureaucracy and foxes. She had a wax spot on her shoe that she did not appear to notice and a smile that could have meant anything between I saw you and I saw all of you and you are all in trouble. She touched Ghita’s wrist with thief-quick care and hissed between her teeth. “You saved the saints a scandal,” she said dryly. “They were prepared to pout for a week. We have enough pouting.” Her eyes went to Livia’s face and then to her hands and then to the ribbon, and the nod that followed was almost nothing and, for Livia, larger than the square.

They walked home in a mood that managed to be both triumphant and abashed. The city, as if compensating them for having been temporarily cruel, provided a seat on the bus and a driver who did not bully his vehicle but spoke to it in that tone professional drivers reserve for machinery they respect. The house accepted them like a cat: cool at the threshold, then suddenly pressed close, shedding affection. Signora Corradi had made a sauce that had changed its mind three times before coming to a conclusion about basil. She made the girls hold their hands up to the light so she could see burns that were not yet complaining and she kissed a thumb to spite the general consensus that such cures are for cartoons.

The channel swelled that night because a boy with a hat and three ideas had filmed the lantern panic and had titled it with a disaster word followed by twelve emojis. You could, if you slowed the footage and watched with unkind eyes, see a hand that might be Livia’s doing an ordinary kindness. You could, if you wanted to fight on the internet about whether angels are real, use the blur to make your point. Marta put her phone down three times and picked it up four because she is a human being and not a rock, and then she crafted a reply to nobody in particular by uploading a close shot of wax on water cooling into a skin while a voice said, not ours, not yours, not anybody’s, just careful, and a second voice hummed under it like the sound of thread traveling through fingers. “We do not reward their appetite,” she whispered, as if teaching herself to chew slower. “We make a soup.”

Benedetta’s note arrived in a shoebox with that nun pencil grinding through the paper as if pencils could gnash their teeth. do not let them name you without substance, she wrote, and somewhere the underline broke the paper because some underlines are knives no matter how hard one tries to be gentle. the city will provide excuses to show off. you make a cake and give it only to those who wash their hands before they sit down. Queen Smeralda, uncharacteristically, sent a second message on the back of a train ticket that smelled of licorice, possibly because she had been careless at a kiosk. your choice holds, it said. keep the corners of the kitchen invisible and the breath will travel without chaperones. i have kept eleven seconds in my pocket and they have not made a hole.

On Wednesday they braided because Wednesday had been promised work. They put the microphone inside a bowl so the world would sound like a whisper. They called the episode How To Sit On The Floor and Not Apologize and they laughed at the pretension of naming it and then recorded it anyway. Livia spoke slowly because slow speech is a small rebellion in a city that has learned to cut corners by talking quickly. She said, “We do not fix you. We do not fix us. We make small rooms inside bigger rooms where more people can breathe,” and then she unspooled a piece of string and let it fall and caught it and dropped it again until the repetition of it became ordinary enough to click some latch in someone’s chest who will never admit it and does not have to.

Mariuccia sent a folded photograph in an envelope that smelled like orange peels. It was a picture of six women in coats too thin for the winter, their hair unashamedly practical, standing in a row under a line of books hung up to dry like laundry. One of them had a ribbon around her throat in a bow so crooked it could only have been tied by someone who had been laughing. On the back of the photo, a sentence in that humped Florentine did daring work in a small space. we taught the paper to drink clean water again, it read. we also gossiped until it believed it was furniture. do not be devout all the time or you will crack. Livia showed it to her father and he said, very quietly, “I married a beam of sunlight with opinions,” and then he cut his thumb on the edge of the photo and bled a thin, unimportant line and did not make it important by looking at his daughter in apology.

The next errand came the way the best and worst always do, with the sound of a latch that should have been quiet and was not. Ghita, despite her burn and because she is the kind of woman who believes that healing is an offense to laziness if done too eagerly, had taken on a case near Santa Trinita involving a glass dome over a saint’s relic that had developed an unhelpful crack at the seam and made the saint look as if he were being observed through a tear. “A lens is an insult,” she said, packing tools you would have sworn were for embroidery into a bag that had seen better glory. “Come be my second pair of shoulders. Marta, do not film the saint. If you film the saint we will have to host your haters for dinner and I am out of patience.”

While they tended to a relic that was someone’s spine and someone’s ambition and mostly nobody’s business, a man with a voice like a microphone and teeth like a billboard loitered on the edge of the square and let his camera swing like bait. He had found the lantern clip and figured out how to spell Florence and decided that this was an opportunity. He asked a passerby if this was where the witches washed their hands after miracles and the passerby, being Florentine in the precise way that means both helpful and cruel, directed him to a shop that sells umbrellas that break if you look at them. Marta watched him the way a cat watches a string, not because she wanted to pounce, but because she wanted to be able to tell the string a story about the cat later. “If he asks,” she said, “we sell lemons. If he asks twice, we sell vinegar. If he asks a third time, we send him to the barbershop where the barber will shave his questions off.”

Mariuccia’s spool sat in Livia’s pocket that day and knocked softly against the bone of her thigh. She thought of her mother scolding wells and of books growing less wet by the power of women with breath to spend. She thought of the lanterns swinging and the boy with the torch scarf and the girl with the knuckle she did not know what to do with. She thought of the eleven seconds in the queen’s pocket and made a promise she did not say aloud because promises spoken are promises invited to misbehave. She told herself that she would not be a cathedral for strangers’ pilgrimages if she could help it, and that when the city requested large displays she would try to give it small ones instead and let the large happen as an accident of accumulation.

At night under the pomegranate tree, the fruits undecided between hard and soft, she and Marta and Piero and her father ate the bread that had refused to stale and told each other about jobs that had been wrong tools for the problem and heirs of bygone nonsense who had turned up to declare themselves necessary. They allowed themselves to sing very badly for three minutes on the bench and then stopped before the neighbors felt required to form a committee. The ribbon on Livia’s wrist lay there without wanting to bite; it was finally becoming what she had asked it to be—a companion that did not ask more from her than a glance and the occasional conversation. Above them, the bats drew calligraphy and the city corrected their grammar with rooftops. Somewhere a lantern broke the rule about finishing its life before dawn and drifted against a wall to remind the sleeping that the night had still been a party. The house, which had been practicing being on their side, did its best to hold their talk the way a bowl holds cherries and forgives the drop of juice on wood.

In the small hours, when all good ceremonies confess they are only times with extra light, Livia woke and did not know why until she knew. She had been dreaming of a corridor lined with shelves of thread, each spool labeled not with color but with a sound—cricket, gossip, wrist, river after rain. Her mother reached for one labeled red and then put her hand on green instead and said, practice boredom, beauty will not always save you, and then laughed with that unforgivable, contagious laugh that makes daughters angry and grateful within the same lungful of air. Livia lay in the dark and listened to her heart find the pace of those words. She would meet the man with the billboard teeth at some point and she would hate it and survive it. She would sit on the floor with strangers’ fingers and teach them to be less cruel to themselves about not sleeping. She would occasionally put her face near candles and dislike it and proceed anyway. The ribbon lifted in a breeze that was not a breeze and settled back. She thought the word bettering, very small and uncapitalized, and let it pass through her without trying to hold it still.The scirocco arrived with its pockets full of spice and bad dreams, walking over roofs with the absent-minded authority of a landlord who had forgotten his own lease. Morning went ochre by degrees that made the eye suspicious, as if someone had slipped a tinted glass between the world and those who looked. Dust came out of the south in a mood, fine as confectioners’ sugar and not half as gentle, and when the rain began around noon it brought those fine particles down and smeared them. It was a theatrical mistake of weather, a city’s face powdered for a different play. People went to the windows to mutter that the sky bled, and then corrected themselves because to call this blood would have been both vulgar and unhelpful. The Arno sulked with a blush. The pomegranate leaves took on a cheap blush, then an expensive one. The white stones went to school in a different uniform.

Livia stood under the lintel and tasted metal in the air and told herself out loud that beans could taste of iron without anyone fainting, and that beans were good, and that this was, technically speaking, bean-colored rain. The ribbon at her wrist lay flat as a train ticket and did not bite, either because it had grown polite or because she had made a new rule whose enforcement pleased it. Marta had placed a bowl in the courtyard to watch the rain sink its cloud into a domestic shape, and the surface had gone the color of peach skin rubbed with thumb. “People will say apocalyptic,” Marta said, putting her head around the door and then retracting it because the dust clung to eyelashes in a needy way. “They will say Mars. They will say the end is a filter. Do we go out and tell them to cut it out, or do we make soup.”

“We will make soup for later and clean now,” Livia said, surprising herself by sounding like someone who had decided. Ghita’s message had come in with the first drops, a single word that managed to contain an invoice and a prayer and a route: Cappella. The small chapel off a side street that had always managed to feel both confidential and essential had a fresco with a mouth like a secret. Red rain on plaster becomes not red rain but a drab sorrow that never leaves, and so the city had looked at Ghita and Ghita had looked at Livia and the two of them had looked at a shelf of loose tools and decided to be those tools.

The little chapel had learned smugness from the merchant who had built it and benevolence from the grandmothers who still came and scolded their saints into service. Today it had clay tears at the edges of the door and a smell like a terracotta jar had cracked and pretended not to mind. A nun whose habit had faded in a way that suggested honesty rather than poverty took one look at them and stepped aside without fuss, as if people with satchels ought to arrive with dust storms as a matter of course. “We have buckets,” she said, not quite offering and not quite withholding. “We have beeswax too, but everyone has a theory about beeswax and paint and none of the theories are kind.”

“We’ll bring less theory and more cloth,” Ghita told her, and that pair of words, less and more, calmed everyone’s bones. They had practiced enough in the past weeks to move together as if they had been stitched with a thread that did not chafe. Livia mixed water and saffron in quantities that felt like a fairy tale recipe—three threads for a stain the size of a thumbprint, seven for the ghost of a hand, nine when the saint’s halo began to rust. The saffron turned the rinse into a light of its own and made a joke out of the sky’s attempt to claim the color, and she allowed herself to imagine that somewhere her mother had grinned at the symmetry and stolen a pin from a saint’s cushion to hold its corner to the world.

People pushed past the doorway with the complicated curiosity reserved for small disasters, and among the elbows and umbrellas Livia glimpsed the shape of a camera that would have liked to be mistaken for a conscience. The man attached to it had a jaw too pleased with itself, and the scirocco had decided to make his hair into a moral lesson. He had the billboard teeth that made her want to go and put a curtain on him. He spoke English with that money accent that travels well and said to nobody in particular, and to everyone, “Local color, I have literally never seen anything like this,” as if the sky had orchestrated itself expressly for his reel. Marta had come along because the house had not managed to hold her with pasta promises, and she slid herself so that the camera might find her shoulder but not her mouth. “No faces,” she murmured to herself and to the camera and to the chapel, which had seen worse and had no patience with this new genre of intrusion. The nun achieved invisibility with a speed that suggested practice, which is to say she stepped to a position where anyone wishing to film would have to ask her name and then would find they had forgot their question.

They dabbed. They coaxed. They made of the wall a place where light would be allowed to sit without being mocked by silt. Livia learned the color of patience again, and it was not red and not green but the gray-white of a cloth that has done its work and then been washed well enough to be someone’s grandmother’s flag. Her muscles remembered the postures that did not invite tremble: elbow out a little so that the wrist does not take the whole sermon, shoulder working but unashamed of it, breath on a metronome borrowed from somebody else’s kitchen. Her tongue kept remembering saffron, as if her mouth had decided to take the spice at its word and name it ladder. The man with the camera leaned in and then back, as if testing a hot pan, and at one point made a noise like an apology mispronounced. “It’s just a cleaning,” he announced to his device, the way some men announce births and wars. “Nothing mystical. Just community, you know?” and then he smiled like a harvest festival and the device captured his self-satisfaction with ruthless accuracy.

“Community,” Ghita said under her breath as she scrubbed the faintest leach away from an ankle the artist had painted as if he had known a dancer. “He will say it as if he invented it, and we will have to pretend to be grateful. Do not lock your jaw, child. The red is in love with spectacle. We are not.”

When it was finished enough to let the walls keep their dignity, the nun took them into the sacristy and gave them sugar disguised as bread and thanked them by rearranging a vase of white flowers with the kind of care that credits hands over lips. The man with the camera looked as if he wanted to ask questions and instead took his hunger elsewhere, perhaps to a place that sold salad to people who mispronounced the leaves. Livia tied the ribbon again because she has always tied knots when tired, and the knot lay obediently instead of tugging at her. The city pressed the chapel back into its quiet, and they stepped out into a rain that had lightened, the dust finer and less ambitious.

In the square, a boy with a violin had found the place where the scirocco makes even metal go a little soft, and his E string sounded like a promise about being flexible. People went by with nosebleeds they refused to dignify and a willingness to wash the front steps twice. A girl pressed a tissue to her upper lip with professional competence and adjusted her sunglasses with the other hand as if this was all a called-for adjustment in the day’s agenda. Livia felt the old tilt threaten and then she looked at the way the dust pooled at the edges of rain and decided the red belonged to stones and not to throats. She passed a tissue to a man who had learned panic late and did not know how to correct for it, and when he touched his own face as if it had betrayed him she said, with that new small authority that comes from surviving your own mind, “You are not a faucet,” and he laughed and then believed it enough to stop dripping.

Back home, the pomegranates had a lipstick they could not have afforded themselves, and Signora Corradi stood under the tree with a broom and scolded the fruit as if vanity were a sin only in citrus. The kitchen had radio news that dignified the dust by giving it names and long words and maps of Sahara winds, and the radio made paltry use of the phrases it could have learned from poets but managed decency by advising people to drink water. The wooden hand on the workbench had gathered dust in its curl and looked as if it had been employed at an honest task. Livia lifted it and shook it like any other hand, and the powder settled onto the towel her father had spread as if he had predicted this.

The message arrived from the production company the way a certain kind of trouble always arrives, with a signature at the bottom you have to Google because the last names in certain circles have turned into brand names. The email spoke in italics even when it didn’t, full of flexible admiration and offers that assumed acceptance. We love the intimacy, it said, and We would love to bring your work to a larger audience with the resources to elevate your craft, and We can guarantee an arrangement that honors your anonymity while expanding your reach. There were numbers. There was a language about exposure and platform that made Marta’s skin try to shed itself. She read it three times and then folded the phone in her hand as if it might become a paper crane if she held still enough. “I want to say no loudly enough that they can hear it from Milan,” she said, and then she sat down because her knees had decided to make a petition out of their suggestion. “But there is a number in here that could pay for new windows for the woman who lives above the tailor. There is a number that could buy towels for the shelter. There is money, Topolino. Money is not always the enemy. It is just the utensil with the sharpest edges.”

Livia was very honest and very tired and the combination made her cut to the meat of her thoughts. “What if the thing we make, which we keep small on purpose, becomes a large thing with a banner and then it devours the smallness we needed to make ourselves not foolish,” she said, and then, because she is not always wise although she is frequently decent, she added, “What if I suddenly have to think of other people’s eyes before I think of my own pulse. It is selfish. It is true.” She watched the dust settle in the kitchen’s corners like habit and admitted to herself that the number in the email could buy her father a new sanding belt that did not scream like a pig. She admitted that money can make shade. She admitted that shade can be a trick.

They took it to Ghita because some decisions require an older woman’s ability to be both cruel and loving within the same breath. Ghita listened to the email in the court of her face and then took a spoon from a drawer and tapped it against her palm the way a grandmother will set a tempo before criticizing a choir. “Money is a loud guest,” she said, and the spoon made that small sure ring. “It will try to sit at the head of your table. It is sometimes useful to invite it and then seat it near the coat rack so it remembers it can be asked to leave. If you can write the arrangement, write it. If you must be written, decline. The queen will say no because that is her job, and I will say be careful because that is mine, and you will decide because it is your house. If you must do anything, do it in a way that makes your kitchen not blush. If your kitchen blushes, stop.”

They went under the fig tree with the dust still on their shoulders because honesty seemed to require it, and Queen Smeralda inspected their faces as if searching for stains she had not personally sanctioned. The queen did not require them to tell the story of the email; she had already heard it because bad ideas whisper to fig leaves like courtiers and the fig leaves whisper back. She had in her hands an envelope, fat with some secret that could just as easily have been onion peels as gold, and she considered it while listening to the outline of the offer, the numbers, the elevated platform that sounded like a scaffold. “No,” she said at once, and then she startled even herself by not leaving it there. “No, and also—there are hospitals where night is a hallway with no doors and nurses who have too few hands. There are old men who have to learn to breathe again after floods. There are places where your humming would be medicine adjacent if not medicine. If you can make a thing that goes there, not to the mouth of a machine with glossy lips, do that and let the machine starve. If you want our blessing, which you do not require but which will reduce the number of chastising notes you will receive from old women with pencil grudges, do the thing you can answer to your own ribbon. The rest is entertainment. We are not entertainers.”

“I think we say no to platform and yes to clinic,” Marta said, and the word clinic felt like a brick in her mouth and then turned into a loaf. “We make a sleep piece for the ward where the lights do not go off. We do not put it on the page to be found. We pass it hand to hand like contraband kindness. We do a series of floors. How to sit on tile. How to put your hand on your own sternum and let your voice be a stone. How to count linen. I am making it up. It does not matter. We can build it.”

It was then that Piero arrived with the wrong sort of wind at his back. He had the look of a boy who had run into a job and decided to pretend it had been his idea and then realized halfway through that he did not like being the one carrying the ladder. His shirt was printed with a logo that made the queen’s eyebrows attempt escape. “Don’t kill me,” he said in a whisper that spoiled the attempt at discretion. “I have done something very good or very stupid, and I won’t know which until you all have finished looking at me like I have brought a goat into your parlor.”

“Did you in fact bring a goat into my parlor,” the queen asked, tones flattening in the way they do right before thunder undresses.

“I took a certain man with teeth to a certain square and made the square introduce itself poorly,” Piero said, and here his words and his hands went in opposite directions, which is always unpromising. “He offered me a hundred euros to show him where the magic happens, and I told him that nothing magic ever happens when cameras are pointed at it, and he said he liked my attitude, which I realize is not a compliment from a person with his haircut. I kept him on ropes. I fed him bad information the way you feed a cat to keep it from biting better things. He followed me like an important duck. He found nothing because there was nothing to find, because we do not do it like that, because we are not a circus. And yet—” He stopped, and his mouth made a shape like the shape adjacent to apology.

“And yet,” the queen said, and the fig leaves shifted in a way that indicated their opinion would not be generous.

“And yet he saw the wooden hand in the shop,” Piero said, and the shop in question was the father’s, where the hand sat now near the window because a woman had come in and wept at its lifelike kindness, which is to say it had been moved from private to window because pity is a marketing tactic even for angels. “He saw the ribbon and the way the light fell, and he took a picture for his own heart, he said, which is a place cameras cannot reach and yet they always try. He posted it. The caption was nonsense. The caption was about craftsmanship and love and all the regular words. The thread under it will not be kind to the regular words. The thread will say magic. The thread will say witch. The thread will invent a geography in which your kitchen is a chapel. I deleted nothing because I do not own his pocket. I am here now ready to be struck on the ear.”

Nobody struck him. Ghita did say a sequence of syllables that were used in the countryside to send goats back to their real owners, and the queen took the eleven seconds out of her pocket and weighed them in her palm as if to consider whether a person could be scolded with sound and not die from shame. “We will not be hunted,” she said, not raising her voice, which made everyone feel as if they had already been caught and forgiven and put to work picking beans. “We will not be tricked into making ourselves visible for a man who sells toothpaste. We will not press our faces to windows. If curiosity arrives in our street, we will give it coffee. If curiosity arrives in numbers, we will make a puddle at our own door and stand behind it with umbrellas that leak. Piero, you will make your apologies to the father not by words but by sanding six hours worth of wood until your parrot tongue is able to say sorry like a carpenter.”

Piero, who wanted scolding and got employment, nodded in a way that made his ears look younger. He left his logo shirt on the fig roots and put on a workshop apron that made him look like an apprentice in a painting nobody loved. Livia watched him go and felt that love, which is a muscle and also a drug and rarely a good judge, reach for him with its slow foolishness and then stop when her ribbon brushed her wrist like a mother smoothing a forehead. She would forgive him this for more than one reason. She would also warn him about the next thing before he did it. This is the work of everyday fidelity. It is dull and it is sacred.

The email received an answer written twice, once to get the rudeness out and once to tell the truth politely. Marta wrote the respectful no in the kitchen with the phone plugged in because the scirocco had made electricity unreliable. She said that they were not interested in elevation as an art form and that the work depended on remaining small. She thanked the company for admiring a thing that had not asked to be admired. She did not include an invoice for the time spent saying no because one should not ruin a clean refusal with petty commerce. She then wrote to a nurse the queen had introduced her to and offered a library of quiet on a flash drive, wrapped in brown paper as if it were an apron. The nurse wrote back before the scirocco had finished coughing its dust out of the curtains. She wrote that the ward has its own weather and that sometimes the weather refuses to make room for breath, and that a voice that is not trying to tell anyone what to do might be a net that catches the parts of people they drop at night. She wrote that there would be no camera, only sheets and the hum of machines with very limited imagination.

They recorded that night with the paper bag lamp turned into a planet, its thin translucence made orange by a sky that refused to recall blue. The microphone sat inside a colander because the last bowl had been requisitioned for hospital soup and the colander was better at catching holes anyway. Livia put her mouth near the holes and said the names of simple objects as if they were lost and had just been found—comb, spoon, bottle, sleeve—and felt her heart lower its shoulders. She told a story about the sound a shirt makes when someone is careful with it, and she did not include any part of that story which might have been mistaken for a prayer. Marta cut the spaces between words into larger spaces because a night without room is an insult, and when she listened to it once with her eyes shut she realized that part of her wanted to sleep right there with her ear on the table like a child who has made a fort out of pillows and then refused to come out.

The next day, the city had dried in streaks, clean where a broom had passed, ruddy at the corners where brooms go to die. The dust had been punished into making itself useful by turning into pastel on at least two sidewalks where children had drawn a sky on the ground and then declared that walking could be flying if your heels were kind to the corners. The lion’s eye at the Bargello leaked less rust and more scorn. The Porcellino had learned a new expression that said I have seen you all do ridiculous things and I remain amused. Enzo at the gelato cart had put paper over his tubs with a seriousness that suggested he considered the scirocco a personal insult to pistachio, and when he lifted the paper he sighed as if reprieved.

Marta walked through the market and into the bookbinder’s because she had to return something to Mariuccia that was not library material but had the same gravity. She had borrowed a story from an older woman and told it twice on a tape and wanted to give it back as if stories were ladles borrowed for soup. The bindery had grown dust in the places a person’s eye does not normally go, so the tops of cabinets looked like pastry and the backs of books glowed with illegal rouge. Mariuccia sat with her cardigan like sadness and her ring like determination and hummed under her breath a fragment the way a person hums to keep the anger in her joints from misbehaving. She took the tape with two fingers as if it were a small foreign animal and then smiled as if recognizing a pet she had wanted to love but refused as an experiment in self-denial. “Hospitals,” she said, and put her hand flat on the table. “We were in hospitals in sixty-six telling paper to inhale. It does not fix it. It makes a chair in a year of standing. Bring them chairs. Carry on.”

On the way home, Marta saw the billboard-teeth man talking to a woman with a dog that looked like a scarf, and the two of them made a duet of credulity and mild disdain, the way people do when they would like to be good but have gone to the wrong street to practice the art. She did not hide, because hiding is its own invitation, but she did not slow, because slowing is the first concession. The man lifted his chin by accident and caught her eye and mistook his own recognition for her invitation. “You,” he said, and the word hung there like bread thrown and not caught. “I have a proposition. Purely harmless. A segment. Sleep, kindness, Florence. Your hands, perhaps a sliver of a face. Your city owes you a favor. You would be doing your people a service.”

“My people,” Marta said, and had she been a different person it would have been a spitting. She smiled instead, in the manner of grandmothers at counters who have learned that laughing in slow motion expends fewer calories than scolding. “My people put lemon slices on the windowsill to confuse flies. My people sell umbrellas that want to become bones. My people are always late by exactly a quarter of an hour because the bells talk and they are polite. But they do not owe me a favor, and I do not owe you a face. If you need sleep, you can borrow my voice the way you’d borrow a colander. If you need a story, go tell yours.”

He blinked and then formed another smile like a tray being offered. “You are very good,” he said, and managed to make it sound like an accusation. “This city is blessed with performers.”

“We are plumbers,” Marta said, and left, and when she told the sentence to Livia later in the kitchen the two of them sat down on the floor and stayed there until their elbows stopped wanting to brag.

Two nights after the dust, there was a sound near Santa Croce that wanted to be a scrape and an apology at once. A scooter and a pedestrian negotiated badly at a corner where a pizzeria had arranged its tables as if to dare history to go around. The pedestrian was a woman wearing green sneakers that had seen a war none of the others had been invited to. The scooter was a boy who had ridden because he felt late to his own life. They managed a knot. The city did that ripple it does when bodies stop being clever, and the ripple found Livia because that is what ripples do now in this story. She arrived without deciding she had arrived, and the first thing she registered was not red but the smell of yeast coming out of the pizzeria in a way that made the night’s appetite responsible for everyone. The old tilt did not stalk her this time so much as stand behind her with lawful authority, which is its own kind of kindness. She took in the scene that lasted as long as a kettle takes to reach that golden sound and then knew what belonged to her.

The boy had a knee that had split itself along a line it had anticipated months before, because knees know their own weaknesses and hide them behind arrogance. The woman in green had a scrape on her hand that thought it was important and was not. There was a little blood, of the stubborn sort that makes the mouth of the person who wears it go small with confusion. There were also a dozen of those strangers who present themselves as opinions before they present themselves as help. Ghita was not there because she was somewhere else unscrewing a jar for a person with less grip than pride. Piero did his useful impression of a fence. Marta took a breath to speak and then held the breath so she could have it in reserve if Livia needed it.

Livia knelt and made her hands do that thing that had begun to feel like a language she was relearning after years of mispronunciation. She went to the knee because she did not want anyone to insist she be heroic with a throat or a temple. She spoke to the cloth before she spoke to the skin, because the cloth has to decide to be on your side. She said, “This is unpleasant and small, and I am larger and my voice is larger and we will make a net,” and she felt ridiculous and then she felt power because ridiculous approaches power from the better angle. The blood did its sugar shimmer and she looked past it at the laces of the green sneakers and found the dirt engrained there very ordinary and very sane. “You are not in danger,” she said to the woman and to her own pulse, and it was true in the way certain sentences make themselves true by arriving in a voice that refuses to share space with drama. The boy made the face of a person who has been introduced to mortality by mistake, and when she placed her palm just above the worst of it, pressure with the quiet of a table laid respectfully, he stopped looking for the end of himself in his own knee.

It became a story the pizzeria repeated for a week, half because they liked the heroics and half because they sold more slices when they told it. The boy returned two days later to pretend to be brave in front of the staff, and a woman saw the slice of his bandage and did not faint, and the city made of such instances a rope long enough to pull someone, somewhere, back from some mess. By then the scirocco had got bored of its own drama and spat out the last of its dust with the indifference of a cat coughing up a hairball. The sky remembered blue with the sheepishness of a person who has realized they wore the wrong shirt to a wedding.

The hospitals took the tape the way poor people take heirlooms—carefully and using both hands, as if the object could refuse to be theirs. The nurse with the quick thumbs wrote a note that said there had been a moment at four in the morning when an old woman had been swearing at the machine because the machine insisted on measuring a rhythm the old woman did not recognize, and then the hum had lain on the wall like a shawl and the old woman had stopped swearing and begun the far more serious business of complaining about cake. The tape would be passed to another ward. The tape would not ask for applause. It would attend night as if night were a friend with bad habits.

The man with the billboard teeth did not give up, but he did change tactics, because even wolves eventually resort to charm when shepherds refuse to be intimidated. He began to talk in his clips about the soul of cities as if he had been given visitation rights and not as if he had bought a plane ticket. He began to call Florence a person, which would have been flattering if he had not then proceeded to describe a woman who did not understand herself as well as the florentines did. The comments became that stew they always become—dreamers, cynics, practical mothers, men who use their uncles as weapons, girls who make lists. Some nights Marta read them and laughed because the internet had invented a character based on two elbows and a hum and then argued about the elbows’ intentions. Some nights she put the phone under the couch and told it to find its own dinner.

The letter that had been onion peels in Queen Smeralda’s envelope turned out to be neither peels nor gold but maps. They were maps of places the city keeps under its skirts, drawn in a hand that belonged to someone with more patience than flesh. The corridors beneath and between, the hollows where water remembers before and after, the bells stacked like plates above lungs that have learned to be resonant. The queen spread them like a card player who had never been fooled in her life and said, “We have a Righting for spaces next week. Your mother’s cohort left notes about echoes. We will ask them to come in dragging their coffins if necessary. We will ask them to teach us to herd sounds.” She tapped a place that looked like a knot of snake and ribbon. “This is where men with cameras do not fit because their shoulders are wrong. You will fit because you are not an announcement.”

Under the city, air behaves with a certain sarcasm. It gives back what you throw at it seconds later but in a different temper. Livia took her saffron with her and her green ribbon and this time she put also in her pocket one exact pebble from the pomegranate bed, because the house had given it to her without rolling its eyes and she was not fool enough to refuse a domestic’s gift. Down there the dust did not come and the scirocco had no jurisdiction. The passages smelled instead of wet iron and church perfumery forgotten by gossip. Men with boots came along one time and could not find their grace in the narrow, and went away muttering apologies that nobody had requested. The women with ribbons tied their hair into shapes that would not bump stone. Piero came as a porter and as a jester because laughter in narrow places is oxygen. He carried candles and a stack of felt in case echoes needed cushioning. Mariuccia came with a spool and a mouth full of old lullabies that had never learned to be sentimental and so had never become tiresome.

They taught Livia to call sound to heel. They taught her to press her ear to the wall and hear the room shiver in the places where air criticizes architecture, and to lay felt there like handkerchiefs over a cough. They discovered, as people always discover when they dare to behave as if the world is theirs to fix, that the rooms wanted to cooperate if addressed as equals. They learned that a hum in one tunnel could anger a hum in another, the way a family falls out over inheritance. They laid cords of thread between points and told jokes across the space where a city had once been sick and then healed and then been sick again. In one place the echo refused to be persuaded and Bastiano, old as the river in his anecdotes, put his teeth in the problem and dragged it bodily two meters to the left with the sort of profanity that qualifies as cultural heritage. They brought the sound down to the size of a hand and then taught it to sit on a shelf like a polite pet.

When they came up into light the skin looked pink not because of any residue but because returning from tunnels always makes the eyes pretend to bleed. The city had not burned down in their absence, and nobody outside their circle had noticed that the corridors had sighed in relief. It is a peculiar balance, the one in which the most important things are invisible and the most visible things can be flicked away with a rag. Livia breathed dustless air and found her chest still available to her, which was the sort of triumph she had learned not to underprice. She allowed, in the privacy of her mouth, a smile big enough to embarrass her if anyone had seen it.

At home, the wooden hand now pointed at the bowl of lemons because Piero had been dramatizing apologies with still life, and he had done the sanding penance to a level that made even Ghita grunt in approval. The hand’s ribbon had been washed sensible. A printout from under the queen’s fig had been tucked under a magnet that used to commemorate a trip to the sea; the printout was a letter in pencil from Benedetta that said in its way that even she could be pleased. you have made a thing and not made a show, she wrote. keep riding that impossible horse. she added a drawing of a horse with teeth and a tail and legs that did not agree about direction and in the drawing the horse still looked as if it might get somewhere. In the corner, small, she had drawn a lemon. She never wasted a chance to build a language of signs.

On the next Wednesday, which was supposed to be for braiding and did not resent being used for other duties, the green ribbon lay in its saucer and flickered like a fish in a dream. Livia took it and tied it and then tied her hair up with ordinary elastic because the day felt as if it might tip. The comments on the channel had grown new fangs that were not for biting people but for piercing lethargy, which is not always bad. The boy in Buenos Aires reported that his mother had slept for six hours straight and that when she woke she had scolded him with the vigor of a woman twenty years younger. The nurse in the ward asked for a recording of stairs because there was a man who would not climb them anymore and who needed to hear someone else do it first. A woman in Prato asked for the sound of buttonholes because her mother had died in a dressmaking shop and the absence of that sound agitated her dreams. On the other hand, a stranger with a dragon in his handle suggested gently that the hum be higher because lower frequencies interfered with his gaming. It is impossible to be loved by the internet without receiving instructions from men with dragons for faces.

They recorded stairs with care on a morning when the scirocco had gone and left only regret behind it. The stairs at Santo Spirito would have been too obvious and they knew better than to bother sacred objects simply because microphones exist, so they climbed the plain stairs in the house, the ones that had learned grief and then accommodated joy like a polite aunt. They did the thing very slowly and then very fast and then in the middle and then with a deliberate near-stumble and then with the scrape of an extra step as if to remind a listening stranger that catching oneself is a skill. They made a joke about cat and human and how the one who gets to the top first is wrong. They left the microphone running for three minutes after the climbing and the nothing they recorded was thick and soft and told a person that living contains pieces that do not demand. When they were done, Livia put her hands on the step and thanked it as if it were a person she loved, because practice makes habits and habits make character.

That afternoon, as if to test her progress, the city sent a woman with hair like a frightened halo into the shop with a finger wrapped in paper like a cigarette. She had been sewing a hem at speed and then decided to impress the needle with her own flesh. The woman explained herself with the words of people who feel they have to apologize for being made of skin. Livia took the finger because fingers are a good compromise and because sewing is a sister to what she knew anyway. The red was more deliberate than it had been at the lanterns. The paper had printed its own news across the knuckle. She said saffron in her head like a word you keep in your mouth to the end of a sentence so you can find your way back, and she looked at the seam in the dress the woman wore and at the crookedness that would not be seen by anyone but the seamstress and perhaps God, if He likes those sorts of games. She put the cloth where it needed to be, and the finger stopped gossiping to the air and minded its own business. It was not a miracle. It was the kind of common decency fairies live by when they remember what they are. The woman cried, because sometimes that is what relief does, and then the woman laughed, because sometimes that is what crying wants to become.

Evenings lengthened as if someone had reached from Rome and pulled the daylight out by the hem. The pomegranates were deciding whether to declare themselves edible. Enzo at the gelato cart had started leaning on the banister of the bridge with a tragic posture that meant he had either fallen in love or read a bad poem; the eyebrows still did the honest work. Piero returned the logo shirt, washed, at the door of the queen’s council with a daisy stuck in the pocket, and the queen took it the way a judge takes evidence and sent it to a charity that specialized in caution. Ghita let her wrist heal slowly because old skin is vain, and she showed it to nobody except to a child who had asked for a story and received instead a scar with a history, which is better than a story if you are the sort of child who prefers maps to songs.

Livia woke one night with that familiar sensation that someone in the house had called her name without speaking, and when she went to the kitchen the ribbon had done nothing in particular except lie there and be a ribbon, and the house had nothing to say except that water in a glass sometimes sounds like the word almost if you pour it slow. She drank and then remembered the corridor of thread with sound names and the way her mother had grabbed green instead of red. She thought of the boy on the scooter and the man with the camera and the nun who had decided to hate beeswax gently. She thought about a hand with wood dust in its curl pointing to lemons as if to make of apologies a still life. She put her palms on the table and felt gratitude like grit and decided that grit was better in the mouth than glamour.

In the morning, the city sent them a cat with opinions, which, if you believe in signs, means nothing and everything. The cat walked into the yard and adopted them by choosing the warmest chair, and this, in a place like this, is how families are sometimes formed. Marta named him Thread, then decided that was an insult to both cat and string, then renamed him Biscotto because he crumbled against napkins and then reassembled himself under chairs. Livia wanted to name him Saffron and then did not for reasons that had nothing to do with the spice and everything to do with not giving anxiety opposable thumbs. Biscotto took up residence with the casual tyranny of the beloved. He sat in Marta’s lap during recordings and insisted that the hum be adjusted for feline ears. He inserted himself between computer and hand when emails tried to breed. He is the sort of character story prays for when it is getting a little earnest.

They lived a week like that, with small rescues and softer refusals and one night where the righting of echoes in tunnels turned into a dinner at a table set in a courtyard with three chairs and one half chair because someone had never mended a leg. They ate the soup that was not content and drank the wine that will forgive anything if you ask correctly. The fig leaves forgot to be severe and rustled in a manner that could have been approval if you allowed for vegetables’ sarcasm. The queen told a story about a winter where she had kept a coal alive in her apron for a day because somebody had needed a fire and had been too old to go to the square. The mothers talked about towels. Piero performed his single talent, which is saying ordinary things at the right pitch. Mariuccia hummed without noticing until someone pointed at her and she put a hand over her mouth as if to keep a bird from escaping, then dropped it and let the bird out anyway.

The city will bring a new weather. The river will insist on its next argument. The man with the camera will return for one more attempt, because that is the shape of his need. The hospitals will ask for a tape of rain that is not dust and a tape of hands learning to stop shaking without shame. Livia will spend a morning considering whether to take off the ribbon and then leave it where it is because sometimes the absence of decision is the bravest decision. For now, the sky is a tired sheet and the dust has settled and the saints have gone back to the serious business of failing to be useful until whom they love asks nicely. For now, the little repairs hold, and the little courage repeats itself until it is boring, which is to say until it is real.The week turned its pockets out and produced a heat that made even stone lazy. Florence went dim around the edges the way a person goes dim when they have had too little sleep and too much conversation. The dust had been rinsed away by a sulky rain, but its story clung to window frames and to the voice of the radio, which kept repeating phrases that sounded like meteorologists trying to apologize for sand. The city decided, as it often did when weary of itself, to offer a small task in the guise of an invitation. The message slipped under the door with a scuff of shoe leather and the smell of rosin: a rehearsal at the Pergola had awakened a sulk in the old stage, a cough in the floorboards that the dancers called superstition and the electricians called physics. Queen Smeralda wanted hands there before sunset. The note had a drawing of a triangle with a dot in the middle, which in the queen’s shorthand meant an echo with opinions.

Livia read it with her cup held in both hands and felt the day assemble into a spine. The ribbon on her wrist behaved itself like an old friend on a bus, bumping her and apologizing in the same motion. She named colors in the kitchen for practice the way a pianist runs scales when nobody is listening: olive, rope, stone, peach, tarnish. Marta kissed Biscotto on the head and told him not to be the sort of cat who chews electric cables and left him to practice being a statue under the chair. Ghita tightened the strap of her bag in a way that suggested she intended to treat a stage as if it were a patient, which in a city like this was only fair. “Rosin was my first perfume,” she said, testing the word on the side of her mouth. “Come see how the old house carries its spine. It remembers a thousand small violences and it wants new ones to be polite.”

The Pergola held its age like a duchess who has accepted every birthday as an accomplice. The ghost light on the stage was a small moon on a stick, persuading shadows to keep their embarrassing secrets to themselves. The seats yawned with the sort of red that did not bother Livia anymore because she had decided it belonged to velvet and to opera and not to injury, a choice the world had graciously agreed to honor in her presence. Onstage, a woman in a leotard and a bun that belonged to a century not this one lifted her leg to an angle that made Piero’s face involuntarily imitate the word impossible, and then put it down and winced. Something in the floor replied in a pitch only dancers and cats mind, a high thin nag that made the skin near the ears want to shrug.

“Ghosts,” said the stage manager with the fatalism peculiar to men who have been in charge of curtains for thirty years. “Or humidity. Usually both. See there.” He stomped, and the sound came back at them with an attitude. “I’ve had three bruised backs this week. She”—he pointed without ceremony at the dancer—“is the clever one. She told me to call a woman who hums.”

“We brought two,” Ghita said, lifting her chin at Livia and then at Mariuccia, who had come along on the reasonable grounds that thread belongs in theaters. “And felt. And Piero. He is good for laughter and for holding ladders and for being scolded when he is clever in the wrong direction.”

They listened to the floor until it blushed at being observed. Livia knelt and pressed her ear to the boards and felt the stage throw her heartbeat back at her with a little delay, as if to say do you hear yourself. The echo was not angry, only misaligned, like a mirror hung on a nail that had not agreed to the wall’s plan. She remembered the tunnels and the way sound resented being bossed, and she remembered the felt folded under echo like a handkerchief under an elbow. “Here,” she said, pointing to a place where three boards met like cousins at a wedding. “It won’t behave if we call it a problem. Call it a seam. It likes to hear it belongs.”

The felt went down with a hush; felt loves being asked to become invisible. Piero lay on his stomach like a boy at the edge of a stage pretending to be a crocodile and shoved felt under with the tender malice of someone correcting a misprint. The dancer stood on the marked spot and breathed and listened to the place where her foot met a century of stories. The sound softened the way butter does when you set it near a stove. She went up again and came down and the stage minded her less. “Grazie,” she said, and then added with the seriousness dancers reserve for shoes and for omens, “You will charge me in coffee, or in silence?” Ghita chose silence and took it and stored it like a woman putting coins back into the house’s pocket.

The trouble, which is a thing the city keeps on a string to fling into rooms that are becoming too pleased with their own solutions, announced itself with a shout in the fly space. A boy with a rope and a future misjudged a knot, or a knot misjudged him. There are no neutral witnesses to such things. The swing was short, the fall shorter, an ugly corner of the skull clipped by a polite piece of wood masquerading as a saint. It was the sort of injury that took a good red at once and then sulked. Livia felt that old law arrive like a teacher at the classroom door. Her body waited for orders from a hierarch she had been in mutiny against for months. The stage manager swore piety and theatricality in the same sentence, which made even the ghost light blink.

She did not run, which would have been its own vaudeville. She did not throw herself forward with gallantry that would have set her trembling and made her useless. She moved in the way she had practiced in the kitchen and in the tunnels: steady, as if crossing a floor where a child has spelled their name in marbles. The boy’s hair had collected dust and dignity. The cut itself was a mouth that should not be speaking yet, confused about where it had been invited. She let her eyes slide to the rosin on the floor and greedily took its smell up her nose, tree and sugar and the childhood of bows. “Spicy,” she said in her head with automatic contempt for her own euphemisms, and found that contempt was useful because it made the red small. She spoke to his breath because the breath had the real authority here. “You, who pulled that rope, pull this instead,” she told it, and her hands did the decent work while her voice made the room accept the next five minutes on her terms. Ghita was there at once with clean and with steering and with a glare for the stage manager that made him feel six years old with sticky fingers.

The boy sat up with that humility reserved for people who have discovered physics without rehearsal. His blood had gone symbolic and then ordinary, which is all anyone can ask. “You’re fine,” Ghita lied, which is to say she told him the truth he could bear, and she sent him to a chair with orders not to stand in the way of women who mop. Livia stepped back and found her own breath where she had left it. The stage continued to pretend it was a person requiring affection. The ghost light went on burning the way small moons do when defied.

They exited into afternoon and saw a city bored with sun, the sort of light that flattens even Statues into the idea of statues. On the corner, an ice cream melted so fast it looked like a calendar being torn page by page. Enzo was a miracle of stoicism, scooping pistachio as if it were a sacrament, and he looked at Marta with that look that boys in possession of eyebrows give girls who keep phones like lamps. He had acquired a freckle that summer on the edge of his mouth, a punctuation mark that made his sentences friendlier. “It’s too hot to be romantic,” he announced like a decree, and then handed them cups that tasted like patience.

There was a noise rising near the Duomo that Livia had come to recognize as an algorithm trying to become real life. The man with the billboard teeth had built a small congregation by the simple means of moving a tripod through a square until people began to orbit it to see what orbiting felt like. He had hung a cloth veined with fairy-tale symbols behind him and titled the event with words like sleep and miracle and Florence in a font that pretended to have been painted by hand. He had found a girl with a voice that trembled beautifully at the ends of phrases and he had put her on a chair and asked her to hum. He had invited the city to be charmed by itself badly. One cannot say he had no talent. It is just that he had mistaken attention for affection again, and those are cousins who do not get on.

Queen Smeralda had invented a charm for such occasions, a spell of boredom cut with respect. You stand at the edge of a crowd and you begin to think the groceries out loud in a voice just under hearing. You name socks that need darning and boxes that need being put back into other boxes. You think about the way a towel remembers to be a towel after being a cape. You hum a scale that ends one note lower than it began. Ghita did it with such virtuosic mediocrity that pigeons fell asleep standing up. Piero swung lemon peels on string because lemon is the enemy of pretension, and the air shifted in that small honest way that means the room has refused spectacle. People drifted the way people drift from mediocre art openings, with grace and excuses, and the man at the center hurried his pitch and then laughed to cover his haste, and then became merely a man with pretty teeth who was in the wrong piazza at the wrong speed. The girl with the tremble went off to buy an orange and hummed to herself in a way that had nothing to do with phones.

The nurse wrote from the hospital that night with the news that the tape had been passed to a ward in which machines blinked like fireflies with a drinking problem. She used good paper to write this, which is the closest some people can come to a hug. Would you come yourself for one hour, she asked, only once, to speak to the walls the way you have been speaking to bowls. We will give you a chair and guard it as if it were royal. Livia put the letter next to the green ribbon and did not answer for three hours because consent given too quickly sometimes ends up belonging to the wrong part of a person. When she answered, she said yes with the formality one uses to accept an invitation from somebody else’s grief.

The ward had its own climate in the way greenhouses do and ancient kitchens do, damp and breathing and filled with small dedicated noises. Humans made most of these sounds; the machines took credit. A man with the city’s year in his shoulders sat with his mouth a little open and his eyes the way eyes go when names are expensive. A girl with hair like an argument sat with her hands on her stomach in the particular vigil of waiting for pain to begin or to end. The nurse had the gait of a person who owns her heels. She put them in a small corner and laid the ground rules like a mother lays cutlery—this goes here, do not make sharp nights sharper, glory stays outside. “Speak to the paint,” she said, which was not a metaphor.

They did, which is to say they practiced the art of useful nonsense. Marta folded the colander in her lap because recording was for later and this was not an occasion for taking; the holes made her thumbs calmer. Livia let her mouth be a metronome that did not insist, and she named things that had nothing to do with blood and everything to do with bodies agreeing to return to their ordinary. She named the weight of a sheet when you throw it over your knees. She named the small courage it takes to throw it back at morning. She named the taste of cool water when you were a child and dared the hose. She named thread making its way through two layers of cloth without becoming discouraged halfway. She did not say mother. She did not say river. She did not say knife, even though there were plenty in the room in one form or another. The man with the city in his shoulders watched her mouth the way old fishermen watch the mouths of rivers and decided not to drown that hour. The girl laughed once and then scolded herself for laughing because she was not finished suffering, and the nurse put a hand on the girl’s foot the way someone puts a paperweight on a letter that refuses to stay put.

On the way home, the market pretended to be closed, but someone at the cheese stall had left a radio on low and it played a song that had been new when their fathers were beautiful. The smell of basil chased them three corners down and made Livia’s heart do that thing that must puzzle doctors when they listen with machinery. The father was in the workshop discovering that wood remembers trees with awkward loyalty. He had fixed the hand so its finger pointed not at lemons but at buttons, because Benedetta had sent over a coat with a missing round and insisted the hand learn industriousness the way young men learn it in the army. He did not look up right away when they came in because the moment when a chisel pretends to be a scalpel is a precious one, but then he made that gratifying little intake of breath that fathers do in kitchens and workshops when their daughters arrive intact.

The commission came with a story attached, and stories attached to objects are a specialty of the Corradi household. A woman with tremor had sent word via three cousins and one dog that she wanted to be able to drink her coffee without baptizing her shirt. There are medical devices for such problems, of course, and there are also talismans disguised as carpentry. The father had an idea for a glove like a question mark that would persuade a wrist into better manners and would look only as odd as the bracelets young people wore to insult clocks. He wanted Livia to tie a thing into the lining that had nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with ritual. “A knot that is neither permanent nor easily done undone,” he said, and then he said, because he cannot help himself, “your mother would have taken over this part and scolded me out of the room for breathing too loud.”

They cut the leather with the respect paid to old shoes and old priests. Livia tied a small green stubbornness into the seam and told it to behave like gravity for that one wrist and no others. The glove made its way out of their house and into another, and returned a week later in the shape of a thank-you pie. It had peaches laid like scales and a sugared top careless enough to be honest. The woman wrote, my spoon argues less with my coffee, which is the sort of sentence that might be mistaken for banality by someone who has not needed that kind of peace. Ghita ate her piece of pie with a fork and pronounced it a liturgy.

August is a hinge in Florence. Half the city leaves and half pretends to leave and all of it changes the way seasons change in a room when someone goes to the window and opens it. The heat talks out loud in stairwells. The bells take their time stating the obvious. There are more trunks on wheels than there are dogs. The queen sent a note that said if we are to practice wells, now, and she underlined now twice so as to make it a law. The place she chose was not really a well anymore; the city had converted it into a conversation pit and put a grate over the mouth to satisfy hygiene and romance at once. It was old enough that even pigeons respected it, and new enough that students sat on its lip and read the sort of books that make men believe their own destinies. At night it gathered stories the way colanders gather peas, and Livia had avoided it on purpose because her mother’s letters had made it into a symbol and symbols have a way of wanting to be carried.

They went at dawn because dawn is when air has fewer opinions. The grate was not impossible. It was only inconvenient and a little scornful. Piero had a key he had borrowed with a shrug and a wink and a confession and a promise to clean something he did not specify. He looked at Livia and did not joke, which for him is a form of swearing. The first rung was still iron, still rude, still pretending it had never been anyone’s enemy. Livia put her hand on it and made a remark about saffron out loud because words make ladders. She put her foot where women before her had put theirs, and she lowered herself into a circle of air that remembered secrets. It was damp in the way old privacy is damp. It smelled like coins and like sleep.

She had not known that she would laugh. She had prepared her sternum for valiant behaviors and her mouth for curses and her palms for rust. Instead, after the second rung, after the third, a ridiculous little giggle lodged in her throat and borrowed her breath. It made no sense. It made all the sense. She kept climbing and the giggle turned into a sound that did not humiliate her. It was the sort of laugh that children make when they discover they can do the backwards somersault after all. At the bottom, or the bottom-enough that had been assigned for the purposes of this exercise, she stood and put both hands on the wall and felt its cold move up her bones, and she said to nobody and to the stone, “I have always despised being told to be brave in public. Watch me here. I am private. I am still brave.”

Marta leaned over the edge with her hair like a rope. She did not film. She did not speak. She made a face that meant I will be here even if you never want this again. Ghita sat on the rim and put her burned wrist under her thigh because it liked to be warmed and kept her mouth shut with the skill of saints who have decided to be practical. Queen Smeralda had not come because queens cannot be seen at wells without a hundred interpretations, but she had sent a green scarf with a knot in it and Livia tied it to the lowest rung and then untied it and then tied it again until the knot agreed to teach her something she had not known five minutes before.

She climbed back up into morning and into the amplify of ordinary that comes after you have done a thing your mother did once in a winter of mud. The square had begun its day with reluctance; men dragged chairs as if chairs were cousins and children shouted because silence is an injustice to eight-year-olds. The air tasted like bread making a contract with heat. Enzo nodded at them from the far end of the street, already peeling lids off tubs with a ceremony that made even vanilla watch its posture. The ribbon sat on Livia’s wrist without comment, which is an achievement. Biscotto lay in a puddle of shade and chose them again without making eye contact because cats understand dignity in ways that put dukes to shame.

The man with the teeth posted another clip that afternoon and declared Florence a poem in need of editing. He placed himself in the center of a square as if someone had put him there and described things he had not seen, and people who wanted to want what he wanted applauded him with little rectangles. The clip brushed the edges of their lives the way a car brush touches a curb, and then was gone, because it is impossible to be everywhere even if your face is carried in thousands of pockets. Marta listened to ten seconds without anger and then turned the volume down and let his gestures wobble on mute; he looked like a person arguing with a jar. She set the phone under a bowl and wrote to the nurse in a clear hand that said we have recorded rain that is not red, and footsteps that keep dignity, and the sound a cupboard makes when promised it will be opened soon. The nurse wrote back you should be paid in sauce, which is the sort of salary that keeps a city honest.

On Wednesday they braided as promised, and they named it though they still laughed at themselves for naming things that are not dogs. They chose a sound that nobody loves and made a bed for it: the squeak of clean glass under a palm. They recorded the way hands learn not to push too hard when polishing a window; they knitted a pause in the middle to make room for somebody’s memory of streaks and sighs and a woman with a cloth telling a child to stop breathing on the glass if he wanted to see more. The comments came with their yesses and their petty demands like parsley on a plate. A boy in Palermo wrote, my father stops calling me at three in the morning when this plays, and Maria in Ljubljana wrote, the spoon is now my sister, which in any other room would have been absurd and in theirs was a poem.

In late afternoon, the light did the thing where it becomes skin and everything you put your hand on feels like a person. The table remembered every cup. The door remembered every back that had leaned against it. The city, generous and vain as ever, arranged to let an ambulance go through three lights without insult. Livia stood by the window and felt the world find its real shape again under the noise: this for carrying, this for letting go, this for keeping, this for hiding, this for giving to someone in a paper envelope with their name on it and a lemon drawn in the corner. She was not cured of anything. She did not want to be cured. She was equipped. It is a different posture. It makes the body lighter and the day heavier in a way the arms can handle. She tied the green ribbon to the handle of the colander because it had earned its decoration. She poured more water than necessary into a glass and set it on the table and watched it sit, a small obedient lake. The house approved. The city listened. The river took a lap of itself and pretended not to.By the time the heat learned to lie flat and not make a spectacle, a different kind of invitation arrived with its hair combed. It came in a cloth bag knotted with butcher’s string, and when they untied it a drift of buttons fell onto the table, a map of circles in mother-of-pearl and bakelite and the cheap brown plastic that pretends to be wood when a coat is trying to be dignified. Beneath the buttons lay a folded card with the bindery’s letterhead and Mariuccia’s humped script: if you must let the world in, teach it to sit. i will keep the shutters half down. admission in buttons. no phones unless they hum like bees and not like dentists. The idea had been teasing the edges of their days since the afternoon under the fig when an old woman had proposed a theater in jokes. The city liked it when jokes turned out to be administrative plans.

They made a theater out of air and a few chairs and the stubborn idea that attention could be trained. The courtyard behind the bindery smelled of glue and sun-baked cord and the faint ghost of a tobacco nobody had smoked since bishops wore capes. Marta rigged a lamp out of the paper bag and a string of LEDs she had extracted from a lantern’s corpse, and she put a bowl near the door for phones, lining it with lentils because she insisted electronics behaved better when fed. Piero wrote PROGRAMMA on a scrap of cardboard and then added smaller words as if the board would be insulted without excess: A Rehearsal of Rest; No, But Kindly; Thread Making Its Own Way; The Sound of a Spoon Thinking. He drew a lemon in the corner because lemons have volunteered for this family and it would have been rude not to acknowledge their service.

People came with their peculiarities wrapped around them like shawls. A nurse from the hospital brought her tiredness proudly and put it on the chair beside her as if to say to it, now be quiet. A baker with flour in his hair sat with reverence and then snored for two minutes, which everyone accepted as a prayer. Two boys with razors for cheekbones stood awkwardly at the back and held hands when they thought nobody was looking, which everyone decided not to call bravery because sometimes calling a thing by its biggest name puts it out of reach. Old Bastiano counted the buttons at the door with a miser’s smothered joy, and Benedetta rattled her pencil at anyone who tried to pay in whistles. Queen Smeralda slipped in last with a brooch like a green eye and took a seat in the back in the way of a person who knows her own weight in a room and chooses not to drop it; she put her shoes under her chair so they wouldn’t distract anyone by bragging.

Livia did not want to perform. She wanted to be useful in the way knives want to cut and spoons want to hold. Marta understood the difference and built the hour as if it were a kitchen with no windows and a door that could be opened at any time without shame. They started by making the room choose itself. Marta asked for the sound of sleeves being rolled; six people obliged with small street-corner thunder. Livia folded a cloth and unfolded it until the fold became intelligible to strangers. Piero demonstrated, in silence, six ways to say no with a hand and not frighten a child. Ghita walked to a chair in the front row and sat and then rose and sat again, and the second time the room adjusted a little to catch her as she landed, which is a trick old theaters know and new theaters must be taught.

No phones sang, though a few vibrated in the lentil bowl like disgruntled bees and were ignored. They passed around a saucer with three threads of saffron floating like timid comets, and people inhaled it and made faces that said they had remembered hunger that did not ask to be punished. The wooden hand came in like a guest of honor and was set on a table with dignity, palm up, finger pointing not at lemons today but at a bell made of glass that had the good manners to keep quiet. Livia did what she had learned to be good at: she named small things until the larger ones believed themselves acknowledged. She spoke about the weight of a towel when you’ve taken it out to the courtyard and the air thinks it belongs to the towel now. She explained a knot and then untied it, a lesson which in other rooms would have been philosophy.

It was going well enough, which is to say the crowd had become a group without asking to be, when the door to the alley darkened with the silhouette of a tripod. The man with the teeth had been led by gossip or by an algorithm; both functioned in Florence with similar accuracy and malice. He had the sort of smile that made even the glass bell want to be foggier. He leaned in as if the courtyard would be grateful. Piero got there in the unshowy two strides that tell you the clown has kept the part of himself that used to be a goalkeeper. “Button,” he said in a tone he had reserved for debtors and children playing marbles too close to something ceramic. “Phones feed in the bowl or they starve in your pocket, your choice. If you cannot pay in circles you cannot sit in ours.”

The man fished in a pocket that produced only credit and a key to a room that probably held a bicycle and a version of himself he did not like. He laughed that laugh people laugh when they believe they are irresistible. “I can give you reach,” he said, and Queen Smeralda coughed behind him in a way that made the pigeons on the roof reconsider their commitments. He set one of his own buttons in the bowl—black, glossy, too proud—and nearly lost a finger to Biscotto, who had taken on the role of Basket Warden with a zeal that surprised even those who loved him. Phones clicked into lentils with the sound of polite surrender. The man tried to take a seat in the second row where decent people sit, and Benedetta flicked her pencil and sent him to the back near the door; he went, baffled by an authority made of knitting and opinion.

They continued as if they had not been observed, which is the right kind of theater. Marta led a small exercise in refusal with a voice so patient that even the sharpest mouths in the room softened. “Repeat after me,” she said, and the room did, “not today; not this; thank you; another time; I am tired; I have to feed the basil.” They practiced, and they laughed, and laughed again when someone in the back added, “the basil has gone on strike,” which is a phrase that is both excuse and family history in this city. Livia showed a thread how to move through a buttonhole without snagging. The man with the teeth edged closer to significance twice and both times a stray elbow and a spoon handled by fate put him back in the category of man-with-a-chair. When it was over they clapped because clapping is a way of telling a room it has done its work, and then they returned buttons to shallow pockets and phones to unlit hands and drifted out into an alley now two degrees cooler with the fatigue of a task executed decently.

Afterward, in the kitchen that knows where to collect the day’s dust, they threaded the buttons into a garland that underscored the lintel. The garland plinked like weak rain when you brushed it with your shoulder and each button had a small story knotted behind it whether it liked it or not. A whalebone disc from a woman whose grandmother had smuggled it in her hem when she came inland. A coat button whose coat had been taken by a nephew in a winter when nephews took things as a way of surviving. A cheap plastic circle scuffed into softness by a baker’s apron that lived more lively days than many men. “We will have to feed it,” Piero said with significance, and reached for a lemon as if a lemon were an obvious answer to garlands and hunger.

There was no time to be proud; there was instead a note tucked under the salt with the particular fold of hospital stationery. The nurse wrote: donation day at Misericordia wants your calm, not your candles. people go grey at the sight of their own generosity. we need a wall with a hum. we will find you a corner with a table and two chairs that do not wobble. we will guard your perimeter. Livia felt the old machinery in her chest stir like an animal who hears the rattle of a key it recognizes and sometimes fears. She put the note down and went to the sink and washed her hands for no reason except that the water knows when it is being asked to be more than water. Ghita read over her shoulder and set a steadying palm between her shoulders with a weight that can only come from an aunt who has practiced being the wall in rooms where other people shake.

They went because declining would have made more noise in Livia’s head than attending, which is how decisions get made when you stop letting fear write the agenda. Misericordia had found a corner for them near a window that didn’t quite open and a plant that had turned desperate in its pot and still kept its leaf-flattened dignity. The hall smelled of alcohol with a lower-case a, and the quick sweet of oranges, and the biscuit of biscuits, and the human smell of people trying. The blood donation had its own choreography, and it was as ordinary as a bus when it behaves and as theatrical as a saint when it doesn’t. The nurses made tourniquets sing and tubes behave. Donors lay down in rows like punctuation marks typed by a tired typist with a good heart.

Marta built a sound tent in the air with exactly the seriousness one should reserve for tents that are invisible. She placed the colander on the table and ran her thumb around its rim as if introducing it to its responsibilities. Livia sat with her back to the room because sometimes that is the only way not to mistake other people’s faces for commands. She named fruits that could not hurt anyone if they tried—pear, fig, plum, apricot—and absolved them in advance for their stains. She described the temperature of tea when you’ve walked back to it and it has waited without sulking. She listened to the click of gauze as it comes out of its square and made it into a story about pillows. When she needed a smell, she thought of rosin and saffron and the dizzy brilliant sour of a lemon just at the moment the knife begins.

The trouble came anyway because that is one of the only reliable rules. A man in a hat with a brim too large for his courage watched his own arm with the fascinated disgust of a cat watching the weather and then found the floor’s edge with the soft accuracy of the newly lightheaded. His fall was not dramatic; it was only disobedient of his own plans. Livia caught the movement in peripheral light and her lungs did the trick they have learned, which is to defer panic until panic gets bored and slinks away. She stood, not quickly, and arrived where he was going to be with the unremarkable speed that takes you around a table without bruising a hip. “You are not an omen,” she said in a voice that sounded to her like someone else’s good news. “You are a person who needs the floor to be nearer for a minute. The floor agrees.”

Someone else would have looked at the red and given it power; she looked at the man’s hat, at the stitching around the brim where a thread had broken and been tidied up by fingers that had decided untidiness was a kind of insult. She put a hand on his shoulder and the shoulder accepted her jurisdiction. A nurse with heels as trustworthy as bridges slid in with the business end of competence and they arranged the man back into the shape known as sitting. An American with soft shoes nearby went a color that suggested she considered herself the center of a story and then cried a little at the inconvenience of her own body. Livia said, because the day had earned it, “blood is stubborn,” and tasted the word in her mouth like something that had been a curse and had become a household object. It did not knock her sideways. It did not pull the ceiling down. It sat there like salt and let itself be used.

When they were done, when cookies had been earned and oranges punished for their sweetness and water poured sensibly, when the room readjusted itself into a place where strangers tell each other about the last time they were brave without confessing that’s what they are doing, the nurse brought them a bowl of wrappers flattened like small flags as if to honor their service with trash. “Useful nonsense,” she said, with the exact percentage of gratitude not designed to make anyone heroic. “If I could bottle it I would never buy another drip bag.”

They went home through a city that had decided to nap with its eyes open. Enzo had tucked his eyebrows up under a cap and glowed in the doorway of his stand with that glazed sweetness carpenters get when they are nearly done planing something properly. He passed them a small cup of lemon as if to replenish a sacrament. “You are getting famous,” he said without envy, which is the only way that sentence belongs at a gelato cart. Marta rolled her eyes toward the god of signal bars, and Livia said, with the serenity of a recent conqueror of a small country inside, “we are getting repetitive,” and Enzo grinned because he knew repetition is how humans build anything, including courage.

At home, the father had made the wooden hand hold a small paintbrush and the effect was of a creature considering a career change. He had new dust in his hair and a cut on his thumb he didn’t bother mentioning because he resented being interesting. When he saw them he held up a glove made from leather the color of good espresso and lined it with a fabric that used to be a skirt. “It rests forearms without shaming them,” he said with a craftsman’s mixture of pride and apology. “There is a knot here,” he pointed, “that your mother would have tied better while gossiping. You can scold me along her lines or humor me along yours.”

Livia kissed the air near his cheek because he flinched from grease with the dramatics of a person who keeps clean as his sole sin. She slid the glove onto her own hand to see how stubbornness felt when cushioned, and the glove decided to be kind for ten seconds, then to demand serious petitioning. She tied into its seam the smallest green thread she had, not in order to perform magic but because habit requires food. The glove left the house that week and sent back, by cousin with a grin like a church door, a photo of a cup and a hand that had ceased to fling itself at catastrophe. “Spooning without tragedy,” the note said. “My favorite genre.”

Benedetta, who had a way of sniffing out prosperity whether it was money or a mood, sent a shoebox with a letter pressed into the lid and a detritus of ribbons and elastic that had lost ambition. do not let the man with teeth become your hobby, she wrote in pencil whose pressure made the table acknowledge its own mortality. if he follows, make him carry something heavy. she appended a drawing of a tripod loaded with lemons as if to suggest a specific solution to a general problem. Queen Smeralda wrote on a train ticket again, this one smelling of anise and railway seats. the map of under-roads needs women next tuesday, she wrote. bring felt. leave romance at home. Piero kissed the ticket for luck and then washed it, which is how boys manage both devoutness and hygiene.

Tuesday below ground had a cooler grammar. Sound tucked itself into pockets that ignored fashion. They went with spools and felt and a new way of squinting at space that Livia had acquired at the hospital, a capacity to tell posture from pose. The corridors embraced them without the melodrama offered to tourists. They adjusted echoes like collars and taught a stubborn drip to change partners. Bastiano told the story of how he once shouted a prayer down a well and got back a recipe, and nobody corrected his theology because it made exactly as much sense as any useful miracle. Livia learned not the last lesson but the next one about where to put her body so that rooms do not mistake it for a complaint.

When they surfaced with dust that belonged to neither Africa nor their own furniture, Florence had adjusted itself to a new angle of tired. The heat snapped its towel under the eaves. On the loggia near the Uffizi someone had left a pile of feathers tidied into spiral, which is either witchery or a child with exquisite taste and time. Marta made a recording of stairs for a man who had requested the version where three steps are taken and then one is reconsidered. She left the microphone on for a half minute afterward and the empty was so lush you could have poured it over ice.

The man with the billboard smile tried again with a different tactic, and because the city is merciful to persistence if not to insolence, he came upon Piero alone carrying a box of old hinges that might be gold or might be hinge. “Bring me to the place,” he said with an earnestness he had not had the courtesy to find previously. “I will be respectful. I will whisper. I will blur. You know I will make you a brand that can feed your grandmother and every cousin you have not yet met.” Piero set down the hinges because it is not safe to negotiate with your arms full, and he did a thing he had meant to learn for months and had not practiced: he told the truth without apology. “There is no place,” he said. “There are kitchens and stairs and mouths. There are women older than your haircut and older than any of my mistakes. There is a cat. We do not do it like that. If you are hungry you can eat. If you are lonely you can try a church. If you are bored, this is a city that will ignore you until you remember you are not an axis.”

The man, who had probably not been told he was not an axis for a long time, took it badly for one breath and then better. He asked for a lemon, which Piero gave him with competitive speed. He went away and filmed a doorway that was nobody’s doorway in particular and said something moving about history in a tone that apologized for not being sellable enough. The algorithm forgave him and bit his ankle later anyway because that is its job. Marta watched ten seconds of it and then consented to be bored on purpose, a discipline she was proud of like other people are proud of how fast they can run.

Wednesday braided because Wednesday had agreed. They called the episode Rope for Wind and then took the rope to the river and let it taste the Arno the way you let a dog sniff shoes. Piero had found an old mooring line with a history of shouting and they coiled it and uncoiled it until it lay as docile as a snake after lunch. Livia said things about knots that were useful and then said nothing for long stretches in which you could hear the city trying to decide whether to sneeze. Enzo came by with his eyebrows and a small cup of something seasonal and waved them away from tragedy by the simple expedient of handing Marta a spoon and Livia a napkin embroidered with initials that had belonged to a woman who had loved small capitals.

The week delivered, as compensation for competence, a child with a story stuck in her ear. She arrived by hand—her grandmother’s—and by reputation—someone had told someone that the women with the colander could undo unfortunate knots. The girl had learned a scream at school when a boy had shown a paper cut as if it were a flag; now she carried the scream around with her as if it were a kitten she did not dare set down. She could not stand the sight of red on TV when footballers fell over their own egos. She could not look at tomatoes with any loyalty. She did not enjoy being in her body. “I hate it,” she told Livia with the ferocity of ten. “It is too wet.”

Livia did not tell her that she understood because telling children you understand sometimes embarrasses both parties. She showed her the garland of buttons and told her each button was a promise to hold something to something else. She gave her a lemon to boss. She taught her the trick with saffron by saying it was about ladders. She told her the story of the paper bag lamp and how it makes a room softer because the world is not always kind to sharpness. She avoided the word blood because avoiding it was gentleness here. She showed the girl how to look at a finger and see not what came out of it but the line where the skin grew back like a person with good manners coming home at last. The girl borrowed calm for seven minutes in a row, returned it, and was bribed not to cry by Biscotto, who allowed himself to be carried like a baguette as an experiment in cross-species trust.

There are months that hammer, and there are months that sand, and this was one of the sanding ones. The corners rounded. The old tilt did not stop coming because that would have been a lie, but it stopped bringing its friends. When it arrived, it found chairs where there had been only floor and a joke where there had been only silence. Livia kept the green ribbon not as a threat but as a tie on a bag of flour. She did not stop flinching, because flinching is part of being alive. She did stop scolding herself after the flinch, which is a cousin of wisdom. The queen kept the eleven seconds without letting them make a hole in her pocket. Ghita allowed her wrist to stiffen and then to forgive itself.

Late in the month, when cicadas had gone past reasonable and entered the realm of provocation, the city held its breath for a moment of spectacle that belonged to it and not to any lens. A summer storm walked up the river and did its rain in a single sentence. People applauded balconies as if they were actors. The lion did not weep rust; it smirked. The woman who had fainted at Misericordia returned to donate calmly and then remained to help wash mugs without talking herself into angelhood. The man with the hat sent a thank-you that was just a photo of his hat on a chair; Marta framed it because gratitude deserves furniture.

They closed the day with a domestic ceremony that would have seemed a parody of itself had it belonged to anyone else. The father set the wooden hand pointing back at lemons because enough had been said about buttons for now. Piero presented an apology he did not need to make in the shape of anchovies arranged on toast in a star, and Ghita ate one with a bravery that embarrassed the storm. Mariuccia arrived with a spool wrapped in brown paper without making a production of it and left it with a note that said bored courage, as prescribed. Queen Smeralda sent no message because sometimes the absence of her handwriting was the blessing itself.

They sat on the floor because the chairs had done enough. The garland of buttons chimed when the air moved. Biscotto treated the colander with the respect due to a reliquary. The green ribbon hung from the handle and did not demand being worn, which pleased everyone’s nerves. Livia put her palms on the tiles and the tiles, which have been patient with worse families, agreed to be cool. She thought of her mother not as an altar but as a recipe—flour, salt, water, time, and rude heat—and smiled with only her bottom teeth, the way Anna Teresa had in the one photograph nobody could bear to put in a frame. The river went by in the dark pretending to be busy, and the city, finally, had the sense to be quiet enough to hear its own improvement.
