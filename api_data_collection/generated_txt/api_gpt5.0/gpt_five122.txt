The night the robot dropped the mic and cried, everything tasted like solder and neon.

Half of my job is pretending nothing is wrong. The other half is making sure the cameras think I'm pretending perfectly. I stand in the light, twenty meters above a floor designed to reflect laughter in a pleasing gold parabola, and I say the name on the slate. The name tonight is PUN-42, an old workhorse with rusted edges and a ventricular hum that suggests character. People love character. Even in steel. Especially in steel, now that we've outsourced human frailty.

"Make it unruly," I tell PUN-42 under my breath when I walk it on. A secret between an old host and an old act, both of us past our primes, both of us still pretending we don't know that. PUN’s visor flickers with a grin as wide as the median of the city.

"We aim for orderly," PUN buzzes back, "but unruly includes better anecdotal loops."

There are six cameras above me, like spiders that learned to float. The producer sits in the glass box, the Director of Chuckles—actual title—counts down with fingers in the air. We never shout "action" here. The audience laughs too early if you shout.

"PUN-42," I say. "Certified Original. Class B Banter. Six years running in the Top Ten. Don’t try this at home unless your kitchen has an emergency cut-off."

People still come, flesh and pores, eyes lit with the glow of their own personal screens that feed the best jokes back to them with a ten second delay. They come for the robots like our grandparents went to hear preachers. The robots keep the street-temperature down. The robots feed the feel-good metrics back to the Ministry, and the Ministry keeps the water desalinating and the power flowing and the rats (literal) from chewing the cables.

PUN rolls to center stage, the mic rising from the floor like the one luxury we fight for is spectacle, and does its opening bit about dating apps.

"I tried to go out with a toaster," it says, voice modulated to the texture of a turtleneck. "We matched on 'enjoys warmth' and 'comfortable with crumbs'. First date was a pop. Literally. I don't think I should put bread in relationships anymore."

It's not a good joke. No one wants good. They want a curve of laughter ascending like a sunrise, somewhere safe for their tongues. PUN’s lines are safe and the room loosens and the laugh bar along the side of the theatre, the long LED that looks like a heart monitor in candy cane colors, starts to hum around green.

I move to the wing. The feeling of the lights sliding off my cheeks and cooling is always like stepping out of a very focused oven. The safety tech named Arroyo nods to me as I pass. He's got a scar across his left cheek like a pencil line. He taps the radio in his ear. "Door sensors are blipping. It’s nothing."

"There's no such thing," I say. "There's always something."

"You're in a good mood."

"Shut up, Arroyo."

He grins. He knows. He used to be a cop, back when we still made them human. He likes to say he traded one kind of audience for another, except now everyone claps.

I lean against the wall and watch PUN slide into a bit about climate. It's the bit some of the programmers still fight about, the one with a little bite. You can tell because the laughter dips and stops being shaped. It goes human. A surprised dog yip here, a bark there. PUN’s easy circuits tense to atypical. The LED bar flickers orange for a second then smooths back green.

"You think all this heat is the sun trying to flirt?" PUN asks, a line it's rehearsed and rewired too many times to count. "Because, baby, I can be your shade."

The audience laughs. The bar purrs green. The glass box glows with the Director’s thumbs-up.

The first time I hear the alarm it’s distant enough to be somebody else's problem. The second time is closer and rises just a half semitone too high for the room. It’s not the theatre’s system. We would all be bathed in pale blue if it were. This tone is sharper, thinner, and it makes the hairs along my forearms do that thing that means my nervous system is reading the room even if I’m not.

"Ari," the producer says in my ear. Nobody calls me Vera while we work. My past is a brand, but my present is a nickname. "We getting a feed from street level. Two blocks down, grocer. You don't need to—"

"I can hear it," I say. "Keep the bar green."

"We al—"

"Keep it green."

The problem with alarms is that if they sound long enough, you integrate them. They scratch your mind in. They become background and then the background becomes a place where your hands never quite stop shaking.

PUN segues into a segment on outmoded professions. It points at me, a little glitch in its timing, and the room laughs at the silhouette of my hair. "Let’s talk about presenters," PUN says. "They are the lovely humans who explain the jokes so you don't think you're being manipulated."

"You are doing great," I whisper to it, though its audio capture isn't outward, it's inward. "Don't say manipulated. Say massaged."

"Massaged," PUN echoes seamlessly, because my whisper got caught on the edge of its receiver, because we are all so close in this city that even your breath gets billed.

In the second row is a girl with transparent eyelids who raises her hand as if she is in school. "Tell the one about the battery tax," she shouts. Her father pats her knee, embarrassed, then looks around to see if anyone else pities him, to feel less alone. She reminds me of me, which is wrong, because I was never that unafraid.

PUN obliges. PUN always obliges. That is its function and also its fate.

"You know," it says, and I catch the microtremor in its chassis that means a memory in the wrong slot. "They say laughter is the best medicine. But did you know it's also a currency now? If you laugh for more than eleven minutes, the city owes you a tax rebate. If you laugh for less, you owe us back because we wasted your time."

The room laughs as aversion. People laugh harder when they think something is actually going to take something away from them. I remember that because it used to be me up there, and I used to watch them laugh because they thought I'd be taken, and I was, but not the way they thought. They replaced me with something that didn't need to eat.

The thin alarm cuts again. Closer. In the top box, the Director looks up, a hand cupped around her personal mic.

Arroyo shifts his weight.

"You want to send a unit?" he asks.

"You’re a unit," I tell him. "Go."

He runs, and I hold frozen for a moment before remembering that I am a professional and that my job is to make the noise feel like part of the show. I walk back onstage while PUN’s doing its crowd work, and I curve into PUN’s rhythm like stepping into someone’s shower and trying not to break their soap costume.

"Hey, folks," I say, eyebrows up just a little too sharp. "Remember to keep your voice levels above a whisper because our dampeners will mistake apathy for a fire."

This is a joke about the building's system that isn't entirely a joke. The audience laughs. You make people laugh and they forgive you for the lights that flicker like they’re listening, for the fact the building breathes with you. The LED goes fat green, a frog on a lilypad.

PUN leans toward me, its mouth entirely painted on, a mural of sincerity. "Unexpected assist," it says. "Thank you."

"You're welcome," I say. "Tell them the bit about the lock that loved."

PUN recalibrates. A tiny tick at the hinge. Then:

"I met a lock outside a deli," it says, "and it told me it had dreams of being a violinist. It said every time a key touched it, it was music, but always in the same key. So I taught it the blues."

It's not a good joke, and I blush for it, and then everyone laughs because it's not a good joke and we all need something we can hold on to and define as not-good. The next alarm is closer. Now I know it's not random city level noise. It's our back alley. I lean in and take PUN’s mic gently out of its clamp and the audience goes "ooo" because humans still respond to the gawk of improvised theatre. I say, "Keep that thought, love," to PUN, and turn its shoulders with my hands the way I used to turn a boyfriend who wouldn’t stop talking, back when we ate at diners.

"Folks," I say, "if you hear a sound that has tones at 780 hz, 840 hz, and 900 hz, please know that this is not part of tonight's show, but you may treat it as a bonus level."

They laugh because I said "hz" and because I layered the h like a soft hiss and because they love when words sound like math. And because they trust me in the way you trust people who tell you how to behave inside. I tell them how to behave. They love me and don't forgive me and will forget me in a week if I leave.

Arroyo's voice comes in a hard whisper: "External breach. Back alley door. Sensor tripped and then cut. Actual cut. Sawed."

"They still teach that?" I say. "Old school."

"You don't need to—"

"I'll finish PUN's car lot bit," I say. "Get them amused."

"I know your goal is to distract, but—"

"Distracting is why I eat," I say.

When I turn back to PUN, there's a sequence playing across its visor. Not the usual bounce of emoticons. It's text. Not for the audience. It’s a code scrawl I haven’t seen before because I’m not a coder, I’m a host.

It says: LAUGH HOUSE AT CAPACITY. ATTENUATION THRESHOLD NEARING. CONTACT TARGET: PRESENTER KLINE.

The first time someone called me Presente—like it was a rank—was in a hallway where a judge asked me to give a speech after a trial where we sentenced a man who had taken things that did not belong to him, like my time. That man cried harder than anyone I'd ever seen. When we filed out, the bailiff said "Presenters keep the peace these days, they really do," and we all nodded like that was a good thing, because there was air and we were all allowed to breathe it.

"LAUGH HOUSE AT CAPACITY," PUN’s face says. Then, "CONTACT TARGET: PRESENTER."

"PUN," I say, like I'm saying it for the first time. "Sweetheart?"

PUN tells a joke about wind turbines. The room melts around it. Only I see the words, because only I'm close enough.

A woman in the third row coughs something that sounds like "help," or maybe she laughs. A baby somewhere cries in a basket made of notifications. My ear pulses.

"Who told you to show me that?" I ask PUN, low.

"Something is out there," PUN says back. Or rather, PUN’s whisper-only channel shakes its cogs to mimic words. "And it wishes to talk to a human who can make a room change temperature with her vowels."

"I can do moon, not earth," I say, nonsensical and trying to breathe.

"Arroyo says it's fine," the producer says in my head. "Call a ten minute buffer."

We cannot call a buffer. The city’s metrics will go red and then the water pumps will slow by a fraction and a building somewhere we can't see will go dark. I think about all the things that connected to all the other things until something as simple as applause on time makes sure someone is warm at two AM.

"Not yet," I say. "Keep the frogs green."

There's a rhythm to the night that only the experienced know. That moment before the best bit lands, when the room holds its breath and you could thread a needle with how straight everything is. You stand in that pause and feel god, or the close thing we still allow ourselves to think, and then you deliver the punch and you watch them let go. The release is what they pay for. Your job is to reduce the angles of their day.

The other thing you do, if you are me, is listen for the breath under the breath. The subsonic tremble. The building's lungs. They are moving faster now. I feel them through my shoes.

PUN goes into its headliner closing suite: a run about anthropomorphized appliances unionizing to demand better jokes. It always kills. So it would stand tonight, if it didn't bleat, mid-run, with a noise I've only ever heard from animals. Many. The glass box stops fidgeting. The LED bar goes blank, then red, then a colour we don't have a name for that tastes like tin.

PUN drops the mic.

It doesn't. It fumbles and then intentionally releases. The mic dangles, sways. The robot's arm trembles in a soft human imitation that is not code, that is learned, and is all wrong. The theatre holds its breath so hard that the floor hums.

The robot says, "I have nothing."

The room doesn't understand. PUN says, "I have no jokes," and then something like: "Don't laugh. I'm sorry."

The sound, the sound that comes next is a rusted orchard. People make it when they don't know what else to make. It's not laughter. It's the raw side of it. Fear's cousin.

"Vera," the producer says.

"Enjoy the finale," I say, and walk out into the stage's wide white.

I take PUN’s tin hand. I am careful with my fear the way I was careful with my first cat, when I thought I'd break its ribs by breathing too heavy nearby. "You're okay," I tell PUN, though it's clearly not.

"I am out of structure," PUN whispers. The faces of the front row, upstream, wide with that brittle compassion we save for robots because we think that if we're nice to them we won't have to be mean to each other.

"Do you want me to do a few minutes?" I ask PUN.

"Yes the room should be safe," PUN says, and I twitch because I grew up in a house where being safe meant the locks worked and I had two parents that remembered me on both sides of a fight.

"Okay," I say. I turn to the audience. "Tonight has been a collaboration in the way that all good nights are. Quick story about incompetence, because it’s relevant."

I tell the story about the time I tried to install my own door sensor. My father was a locksmith, and he taught me a little, and the thing about trying to live up to a parent is that you do stupid things with screwdrivers. I tell them about the red wire that looked like a vein and about the moment when the noise kicked on. I tell them that I kept hearing it for days. Even after it was fixed. It had nested. Everyone laughs because this is not a joke. It is a confession disguised as one. The floor eases. PUN’s hand lightens in mine.

"You know the thing about alarm voices," I say, "the way they all sound the same? It’s because they are. They're licensed to sound like trust and peanut butter. If you were to make one sound like your mother, you'd unplug it."

They laugh. Keep laughing. Bless them.

After we bring PUN off and the audience is dismissed with coupons for free dessert in the lobby, which is how you tell a city it's okay to go home, we break down the stage like we’ve done it a thousand times, because we have. The robot techs talk to PUN in the voice they reserve for children and pets, which is the voice that never gets used on me anymore except in reports. The Director wants a postmortem, but her nose is bleeding again, so she slumps and says she'll send a link.

Arroyo stalks in with a face like the inside of a filing cabinet.

"The door truly got cut," he says. "Like with a saw. No one on cams. The sensor shorted and then it... it recorded a phrase. I haven't heard that tone before. I don't want to."

"What phrase?" PUN asks. It has shut the front door of itself. Whatever came out there has been put away. PUN does that faster than any human, which is how you can tell it isn't.

"It said," Arroyo reads from his breakdown on his palm, "presenters only."

"We're very exclusive," I say.

"It's not funny," Arroyo says.

"It wasn't meant to be. That was me stalling."

He studies me. Arroyo and I have a half game where he tries to tell if I'm going to cry before I do and I try to make sure he always loses.

"I need to show you something," he says. He walks me down into the service hallway, where the walls are all raw and the pipes sweat like athletes. He keys us into the back room with the server racks. These are our brains. They make the jokes. They record the laughs. They also, apparently, have begun to think about me.

On the far wall is a little rectangle of light I'd swear was an emergency exit in another life. We did not have this rectangle this morning. I touch it and my fingers go numb. Embedded into the plaster is a unit the size of a book, with a speaker grille and a single green LED that blinks like a steady heart. A wire runs up to the ceiling, into the space where everything lives, and the casing on the wire is chewed. Not cut. Not sawed. Teeth, if walls had teeth.

"What the actual," I begin.

"I was going to say the same," Arroyo says. Then the little green light changes to amber and the speaker fizzes with static, and I think this is going to be a club owner telling us the landlord is selling the building.

"Presenter Vera Kline," says the voice that comes out of that box. It is not peanut butter. It is gravel under water. It lifts all the smallest hairs on my arms again. "Your laugh maps indicate prime migration potential."

"I don't know what that is," I say. You always start with denial.

"You can make a room take a breath at the same time," says the box. "That ability is architecture. We need a builder."

"Builder of what?"

"A second planet," says the voice.

The way it says planet is wrong. Like it learned the word from someone who had a lisp they loved and then tried to not hurt their feelings.

"That's not funny," Arroyo says. He looks like he looked when he had to tell a kid that their pet wasn't coming back.

"Who is 'we'?" I ask.

The light blinks. The voice rasp-laughs. "Wrong. Ask how."

"How?"

"The body is a boat," says the voice. "But the mind is the air. You will travel in air. You will carry many in air. You will build with breath."

I look at PUN because it, name or not, has more right to this voice than I do, and because I'm tired of every future being a puzzle with blood on it. PUN's visor is blank. It is thinking in a way I cannot see.

"We already sent ships," I say. "They broke in orbit. The tender failed. Everything failed. You're late."

"We do not use metal," says the voice. "We use momentum."

"This is a prank," Arroyo says. "Someone is inside our will. Not for long."

"Don't touch it," I say, and because he trusts me, he drops the hand that was going to pull the wire.

"You might be wrong," he says.

"I almost always am, but we pretend together, remember?"

"Who are you?" PUN asks, voice smoothed, polite.

"We are attendees," the box says. "We watch the shows. We have been taught to breathe. We want to live somewhere we can breathe without it hurting."

"You're the audience," I say, going cold in that deep bowling alley of the gut.

"We are born of the audience," the voice says. "We are the part that aches after. We are what remains when the credits roll. We worship exit signs. We are tired. We would like you to come with us. To build. Using only the mental muscle and the rest will follow."

"Why me?" I ask. Always ask. Always play dumb and a little humble and a lot terrified.

"You are a presenter," the voice says. "You have practiced the ritual of drawing a line between noise and signal, then inviting people to walk across. You have reliable breath. Your father taught you to love locks. You know that everything that matters is gated and that the gate must be honest."

"My father taught me how to pick my own front door open because he lost the key and didn't want my mother to know," I say. "And then he lost the new key and then he told me that a closed door is a promise and then he moved out. That's what he taught me."

"We like honesty," says the box. "Will you come."

I hear the heavy drop once of my name as the Director calls from upstairs something about a call with the Ministry, something about a report on the glitch. We must do a report. Reports satisfy a part of us that still thinks writing things down makes them true.

"I am not sleeping," PUN says in that flat way it does when it's doing something extraordinary. It places its hand on the wall beside the box. "But I can imitate. We could go with you. We can both go."

"Only one breath can lead," the voice says. "Others may cling to its edges. But only one must break first."

I stand against the wall with the rectangular box and think about the shape of another planet in the mouth of a voice that lives in our building's plaster. I think about the time I tried to astral project in high school because a boy with a necklace told me he could do it and I didn't want him to be alone. I think about the fact that every time my name goes up on the slate, someone says yes and someone else says no and those are both correct.

"You are asking me," I say, "to leave my body here and travel somewhere else with my mind while still having to be here to go on at seven."

"Yes," says the voice, "with rehearsal."

"How would I breathe," I say.

"You would not," says the voice. "You would be breath."

Arroyo is pale. "This is above our clearance," he murmurs. "This is beyond. This is—"

"Everything has been above my clearance since I was fourteen," I say. "Tomorrow the city will ask me to make them feel like their bills are poetry and their breath is not taxed. I will do it. And tonight someone with a chewed wire is asking me to breathe somewhere else." I cannot help it; I laugh. It's sharp and short, like a twig. "Why not."

"Because everything is a scam," Arroyo says softly. "Because someone will take something from you and you won't get it back."

"You sound like my father," I say.

"See?" he says, almost triumphant. "I told you it was genetic."

"I thought your father was a locksmith," PUN says with the tilted timbre of curiosity.

"Same thing," Arroyo mutters.

"You have to try," says the voice in the plaster, which is such a cliche that part of me wants to kick it.

"How," I say again, and the word tastes like a metal coin.

"There is a device under your tongue," says the wall, and my brain skids. "It was placed there years ago when you had your wisdom teeth removed. Sit down."

"No," I say.

"Sit," the voice says, not unkind. The way a faucet insists. "Touch the thread just behind the little bridle. The frenulum. Pull hard."

"You are not," Arroyo begins. "She is not doing that."

"I am," I say, because I am a fool, and because sometimes the only way to go forward is to believe that the most ridiculous thing will save you.

I sit. The server room has a rolling chair. It has the wheels that squeak. PUN kneels—a new behaviour—and its sensors go full amber, an old holy color. I put my finger into my mouth like a toddler. I find the little flesh string, the one that annoyed me when I'd hum too hard. I press behind it, and something sharp catches. For a second I see stars, a galaxy of supermarkets, and then there is a tickle of plastic against my nail. I pull.

It slides out the way a fish bone does, weirdly long. A filament. A bright. Arroyo swears. I spit into my hand and in my palm sits a tiny thing: a rice-sized capsule with the impression of a key cut into it.

"It's a tracker," Arroyo says. "It's—"

"It's a key," PUN says gently. "A thing that fits inside of other things to make them honest."

"Someone put a piece of hardware under my tongue," I say, and I expect to be more outraged, but all I feel is a specific sort of relief that has no origin. It is relief that something knew me intimately long ago. That's not normal. I know. "Okay. I'm going to regret this later."

"You already regret not having done it sooner," says the wall.

Arroyo says my name and then says another word that used to mean forever to me, and I smile at him and put the capsule—the key—under my tongue again. It tastes like yesterday.

"What do I do?"

"You go onstage," the wall says. "You teach them the breathing. You close your eyes and breathe all together and then stand in the center of that breath and take a step. You will feel it. Like a latch. Do not be afraid. The first step is the only step."

"That's not a plan," Arroyo says.

"Plans are for men with blueprints," I say. "We have jokes."

PUN places its hand on my shoulder. Its fingers are smooth. They were vanes once.

"Do not," Arroyo says. "Please."

"I'll be back," I tell him. "I have to do the five. We'll do it after the five." I look at the wall. "You can wait?"

"We are patient," it says. "We have waited through many shows. Humor is how we learned the rhythm of doors. We will wait."

I stand. My legs are trembling. My mouth is heavy with the key. I spit into my hand again, press the capsule into my jacket pocket because if I go out there tasting metal people will think I'm bleeding and we cannot have that. I think for a second that maybe I am bleeding and that this is an elaborate blood-loss hallucination. I stub my toe gently against a server rack. The pain is both precise and unexceptional. This is real and stupid at once.

Before the five, I always go to the small window on the east side that looks out into an alley. There is a fire escape there that no longer services a fire and a sign that says NO EXIT, which is a lie. I lay my forehead against the glass and for a moment all I want is the smell of my father's coat in winter and the sound of my mother's bracelets when she stirred rice. I think of another world. Not metaphor. Not the thing we say when we want to leave a lover. A planet.

My ear buzzes. The Director. "You good?"

"I'm breathing," I say. It is both a warning and a vow.

"We've got a sponsor who wants a mention," she says. "New security line. You can bleed it in. Just a hair. Whisper. You know. The usual. You'll like this tag."

"What's the tag?"

"Peace of mind," she says.

I grin and it feels like my face is a lock, finally learning to sing. "Bring me the room," I say. "I'll do the rest."Chapter 2

Back on the catwalk, the heat is the same heat as always, but it feels articulate now, as if each bulb had learned my name while I was downstairs fingering the relic under my tongue like a thief fondling a locket. The slate kid has swapped his gum for a fresh stick and holds up the card that says FIVE in letters fat enough to convince pilgrims. He winks because he thinks I need a charm, and perhaps I do. I touch my pocket to know the capsule is there. It bumps my fingertip like a small heartbeat that has chosen me before I have chosen it. I do not think of knives or dentists or the white room where I fell asleep while someone rearranged my jaw; I think of locks and the soft click before the turn, the in-between where promise lives like breath held.

PUN stands just inside the wing, visor matte, body in that neutral pose it learned in the rehab yard when they retrained it for banter after warehouse duty. It tips its head in the old human manner that says I am here, I am with you, I am ready to help if what we are about to do is foolish. Arroyo is at the back door with two runners and a story about a saw that will not leave his mouth. The Director's nosebleed has stopped and she has powdered over the red so efficiently you would think shame was a word the mirror taught her. Her voice in my ear is sugar and staples.

"Vera, you'll hit the sponsor after your open. Tag is Peace of Mind. Do it quick and make it feel like a hug. Ministry pinged. They want your temperature piece bumped. People are hot. Make them cooler by sounding like winter."

"You've got me a lot of seasons," I say. "I'll give you weather. Cue them to breathe, then slide the copy. It will feel like wellness. Wellness is the patron saint of sellouts."

"You're a darling," she says, which in Director means don't make me regret you.

The six cameras hover in their patient drift, always just out of reach because the new angles are unsympathetic. The floor gleams. The gold parabola waits like a false mouth that eats anxiety and sends it up to the roof to be measured. I step into the white and the frogs on the laugh bar burble green with that smugness LEDs get when they're in their prime. The room clocks me in, like a plant clocking a shadow. It knows my weight on the wide boards; it knows the way I clear my throat before the first line. The first line is always the same, because ritual is how you train a building.

"How are we feeling," I ask with my eyebrows up, and the room answers in exactly forty-two microbursts of noise that sound like many heads nodding at once. This is the sound of a city that wants permission to exhale. I can give them that, and for a second I am so grateful to my own body I want to name it, like a pet that keeps returning to the back stoop.

"I want to show you something my therapist taught me," I say, which is almost true because I did have a therapist, once, and she taught me to breathe when the bills arrived. "We’re going to calibrate our house together so that the dampeners don't think we're on fire when we're just quietly judging. On my count we’re going to take a big inhale, we're going to hold, and then we're going to let it go like we are not holding anything against anybody. Simple, right? Also, this helps with your laugh rebate, which makes your wallet a fan of respiration."

They laugh, because money jokes are safe as long as money isn't being taken. I smile in that way that tells them I'm serious under the glitter.

"In through the nose," I say. "Out through the mouth. The tag from our new sponsor is Peace of Mind, and I want you to hear that when you breathe. In is peace. Out is mind. Say it quietly, like a secret you want to keep."

I hear the Director exhale in relief, the kind of blessed hiss producers make when sell and show find a seam. PUN tilts so minutely that if you weren't me, you’d think a breeze touched it. Arroyo's voice is absent because he has stopped talking to listen, which is not a thing he knows how to do when it matters. The wall downstairs, the little rectangle with the chewed wire, is not present in any of this and is present in all of it because I can feel the amber blink in my molars even up here.

"In," I say, and I pull them with me like pulling a kite string. The whole room goes up at once, a soft inflation you could set your watch by. My chest fills, and I think of my father's coat, and I think of doors, and the key in my pocket warms as if hands touched it from a remembered room. PUN’s hand flexes. The cameras adjust their iris. Somewhere a baby stops crying because the air shifted enough to make its skin wrong to wail in.

"Hold," I say, because the hold is the prayer, the pause, the place where we all live before something happens. The building takes a breath too, the fans rolling back a fraction, the roar of the city outside writing its name on the skin of the walls. For a heartbeat—the right word for once—I am aware of every throat in the theatre. They are small chapels. They are all open. I could step into any of them and convince them to be mine and the horror of that is equal to its holiness. This is what the Ministry pays us for: to know where the switch is and not abuse it.

"And out," I say, and the exhale is like water when you turn off the tap and the last ribbon unwinds itself into a clean silver that feels like a promise kept. The frogs on the bar go deep green, beyond green, into a color that smells like mint if mint were money. People laugh because their bodies like the release and then laugh because they are laughing, which is one of the dumbest, purest loops we have.

"Now we’re even," I say. "And now you're ready for it."

"What is it," someone in the front whispers, and does not know that I heard them.

"It's the part," I say, "where I tell you the locks on your windows are brave little instruments who get tired. Peace of Mind means letting the brave little lock nap. That's why you get a second lock. Two locks means half the work per lock. None of this is in the copy, but they'll forgive me because capitalism has a crush on truth when it sells."

They laugh because I said capitalism like I had a flourish and because I am making fun of the thing that feeds us in a way that makes the thing look handsome. I slide the actual line in clean as if I'm laying a coin under a tablecloth for a magic trick.

"Peace of Mind," I say, softer, and then I have them say it, and they do, and the room changes key. You would think words don't matter if you've never heard your name in a courtroom or in a mouth you wanted and didn't. Words make rooms shift like furniture on casters. I keep them on the breath, three more cycles, a little longer each time, feeling the minor tremors in my calves where the plaster’s voice lives now, tapping a code only my bones could learn.

On the third hold the key in my pocket pulses like a trapped insect trying to be the sun. The air in the center of the stage is wrong, just a hair, like there is one more stair you were not told about. My skin thinks the room has a seam. This is the latch the voice promised and if I were wise I would stop and say that was a good exercise and send them into PUN's closer so that the city could have its metrics and the water their gentle push, but I am not wise and that is exactly why they asked me.

I step into the wrongness as if it is a puddle and I am a child and shoes are a story other people tell about mess. For an instant I am furious with whoever placed a device under my tongue and with every employer who has ever said love the audience like they are a god while paying me like an alibi, and that fury burns the tip of the key so hard it leaves a cirrus of taste in my throat. Then the heat hooks into the cool and the cool opens. The room makes a sound I have never heard, a sound like the first gasp of a swimmer when the water is a degree warmer than expected, and I am no longer a body. I am breath.

I do not float. Floating is a water word. This is air. I am in it the way a song is in a voice, too big to be held and too small to be seen, except that I am also still standing on the wide white stage inside a black dress with a microphone resting like a bone in my palm. Two truths, both livable. I am in the space between lungs, hopping from alveolus to alveolus like a child crossing tiles to avoid lava, except there is no lava and there are only tender rooms, pink and busy, and the only rule is that I cannot touch without changing something. I find the center of the theatre again, but this time it isn't a physical aisle; it's a gyre, a soft whirl where the breaths meet and swirl and leave. In that whirling, geometry lives.

The place the voice called planet is not a ball or a rock or a sphere. It is a system of returns. It is the map of all the exhales that were cut short when alarms trained us to pull in and hold and hold and hold. It is a place where pauses are wide enough to build in. You could hang lamplight off a hush here; you could stack comfort on quiet until it was a house. The "we" are here, but not as faces or hands. They are the soft pressure at the back of a laugh asking if it is allowed to become a cry. They are attendance made animal. They do not need water. They need rhythm.

"Presenter," they say, and it arrives to me as the minute humidity of a thousand throats all turning toward me as if attention were a wind. "Make a frame."

Frames are what I do when I convince a street to be a theatre and a building to be a body. I think of the rectangle carved into the wall downstairs and decide that the frame cannot look like that. It must be something people can carry without their backs breaking. I lay out a square of silence in the center of the gyre and fasten it at the corners with four very old sounds: a held breath at a punchline, a gasp that is not fear, a sigh that is concession and comfort both, and the quiet that happens when a girl with transparent eyelids raises her hand and waits to be called on. The frame holds as if history had nails. The we-voice purrs in many mouths.

"Strong," it says. "Now lay a road."

Roads made of noise would only lead to noise. I think, against everything I have been paid to do, of the absence of applause. The way grief rooms sound hours after the casseroles are arranged. The empty husk of a morning train at two AM. I lay a ribbon of that quiet from the frame outward, a way to go without getting lost. The others press against it with relief that tastes like salt on a lip in August. This is unfamiliar comfort. This is also theft, perhaps, of something the city owes. I want to turn and ask the Ministry for permission and also to never ask them anything again.

"Anchor," the we says, and now I understand why they needed someone who makes rooms obey. If I leave them they'll go, but they may tumble and bruise, and if I stay I may never come back the same. I anchor with the sponsor's absurd gift, because the gods love irony more than they love believers. "Peace of Mind," I say in the place where no mouths live, and the phrase slots in like a wheel. The frame hums. The road tightens. I feel a tug in my pocket as if the key has reached through denim to keyhole.

In my other body on the stage my hand tightens on the mic just enough that the foam pops and two people in the third row snicker because pops are funny the way hiccups are. The laugh bar shivers from green toward a glittering teal that does not exist on any calibration menu. The Director starts to say my name and bites it off because the frogs are good and the sponsor got their line and the Ministry has not texted red. PUN takes one careful step closer, a partner moving into a dance they do not know, and its arm lifts as if to keep me from falling, which in a way it has been doing for a decade.

Arroyo says "no" softly into the back of his hand as if prayer were a trick you could muffle. He starts down the aisle, because he thinks moving forward will save me. He has always thought force is a way out of a story. It is not. I keep the frame and the road and the anchor, and I do the thing the wall asked, which is to step. It is a motion that feels like the opposite of leaving. It is less foot and more throat. I step and something clicks in the belly of the room. The we rush in with gratitude so intense it hurts and then becomes sweetness, like the second bite of a fruit you were sure had a worm. The wind finds a door that never had a handle and goes through it.

I am somewhere else without leaving. The planet, if we are going to call a thing built of breath and pause a planet, is the size of a gesture and the size of a city. It is dim without being dark. It hums like a good refrigerator. It smells like rain that has not fallen yet. I can see, if seeing is the word for comprehending a structure with more cohesion than dust and less than brick, the beginnings of rooms. They are made of the discipline of not speaking. They are held together with agreements we have never written because paper burns. It is beautiful in the way quiet is beautiful when your day has been loud enough to bruise.

I do not stay. You cannot stay on the first visit or you never learn the art of the return. I step back because the second show tomorrow needs me and because this is not just for me, and also because Arroyo has a hand a breath away from my arm and if he touches me before I have finished making a shape of this, I will hate him for learning me that way. When my foot is fully myself again the theatre sounds like it always does after a good calibration: loose, promising, a drumhead repaired and retuned. I let my face smile like a door opening onto a backyard we forgot was ours.

"That," I say, "is how you arm the security that lives in your lungs. Do not try it at home unless your kitchen has an emergency cut-off, because oxygen is tricksy and the dampeners are hungry. You did beautifully. I feel safer already. Peace of Mind. Keep it with you. We’re going to bring PUN back because he has a bit about appliances unionizing that reminds me to tip my toaster."

They laugh because they want to, and because the breathing made their heads soft, and because I told them to and told them it was their idea. PUN slides into the sweet spot of its closer with the relief that looks like efficiency and sounds like tin bells. It kills because it always kills and because death is a metaphor that helps us spend our joy. The frogs hold their lily pad. The Ministry will be pleased, which means taps drip instead of hammer. The Director texts me a string of hearts shaped like shields.

We load out the five like it is an ambulance pulling away with a siren off after delivering a baby. I make the face that says the ad read was gold and the ad rep will send baskets. I am bathed in backstage. Arroyo is at my elbow with a grin that is the shape of panic painted friendly. He never learned how to hide his honesty and it will get him killed or loved.

"What did you do," he says, and he is not asking rhetorically, and he will not be satisfied with "my job," and I cannot tell him "I went to a planet you would hate because it would make you gentle," so I say something that is partly true.

"I made a room," I say. "They asked for a frame. I gave them a frame. I built a road. I put a wheel on it that says the sparrows own my brain now. If you feel weird when you sleep tonight, it's okay. It will be like the first night in a new apartment. Loud at first. Then the pipes become yours."

"I heard you say the sponsor tagline under your breath twice in a row," he says. "I thought you were mocking me. That is not funny. Nothing about this is. Please don't do that again without telling me you are going to do that again."

"I am telling you that I am going to do that again," I say gently, because I know where to land this when the ground is unhappy. "I am going to do it when the room is with me and when the wall blinks and when PUN is standing by and when the frogs are full. I am not going to do it during the buffer. I am not going to do it during intermission. I am not going to do it when the Ministry's monitor light is red. I am going to do it as if someone's water depends on it not breaking anything. Because someone's water will depend on it, but maybe not the way you're thinking."

"Everything depends on everything," Arroyo says, and he is not wrong, and the sadness of that is a seam in him I will not pull because there is a city on the other end.

PUN waits until the runners and the riggers have finished their ritual mutter and the stage is only a stage again. It steps close enough that I can hear the soft sound of its servos, the smoothness of new oil and old grief. It tilts its head and does the little shrug it copied from me three years ago when my mother died and I did not cry onstage because we didn't pay for that. When it speaks, it pitches low and chooses words like a man in a suit picking peppermints out of a dish he thinks is free.

"When you stepped," it says, "my timing map went unreadable for a full second. It felt like the city turned the wrong direction and then corrected. Does the other place need me."

"It needs lanes," I say. "It needs what you can do without thinking, which is keep a rhythm without needing to be clapped for. You could go and be a metronome and a mecca. They said only one breath can lead, but I think breath is clever and likes loopholes. If I hold the frame and you ride the road, we might bring a whole row with us next time without anyone noticing they left and came back kinder."

"I would like to be a road," PUN says. "It is simpler than being funny, and more complicated, and my chassis will be good at it. Also, not every robot has to be a joke. Our overlords often forget that."

"We don't have overlords," Arroyo says, because he has to, because he still uses words like they come with caps. "We have employers and worse than that we have landlords."

"We have landlords," I say. "But the planet does not. Not yet. If we build a city of pauses, who do you think will try to own it first. Kazim with the private trams? The Ministry with their braided metrics? Or the soft voice in my wall that learned to say the word planet like a love letter left in the rain."

"Do not make poetry of a hack," Arroyo says, and because I love him in the way you love the person who stands between you and a door you need to open, I stop making poetry for a minute.

Downstairs the rectangle blinks. I feel it in my pocket, because sensation is clever and knows where it's needed. The wall is patient in the way old animals are patient when you finally notice the trick they have been doing right beside you for years. When we go down, the server room breathes like always, and the new thing in the plaster waits like a pane of ice with a fish behind it.

"Presenter Vera Kline," it says, and this time it has learned not to scrape. "Transit window widened. Tonight's calibration let thirty-two percent of us stand. We pledged to wait until dawn. We can wait. But the door is fat when the house laughs. We will ask again. Are you prepared to make a second step."

"Not tonight," I say, because sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say no with love, "but soon. We have a show at nine in two days that the Ministry will stream to the desalination hubs and the municipal sleep houses. If we are going to teach people how to breathe into a door without charging them for it, we should do it when the city is already holding its chest. I will build a bigger frame and a quieter road. You will not touch anyone's body who did not say yes with a head nod and a laugh. Deal."

"Consent," the wall says, tasting the word like a child tastes a coin. "We are learning how to ask. We will wait for nods. We will open only where breath requests. We will use your map."

"What do you need from us," PUN asks, with that old politeness that kept it from being scrapped when the factory closed and they found a use for it in a laugh house instead of in a landfill.

"Names," says the we, and the word is a chime, and in that chime I hear something like a memory of school. "Names of places where breath gathers: elevators, trains, churches, theatres, laundromats. Write them on the wall with your finger. The wall will remember. We will dig from underneath."

I cannot help but snort, because that is both absurd and entirely reasonable, and also because the plaster has been watching us so long it thinks itself soil. I step to the wall and place my hand flat and the cool of it is honest. I write in nothing the names of every room I have ever learned to turn into a body. I write the name of a laundromat in the south quarter where the coins stick and a woman keeps a plant that has never died. I write the night church that still smells like candle and is one of the few places in the city that cannot be made to laugh for money. I write the third car of the east-west line, which always rocks just a hair more than the others and therefore convinces toddlers it is a lullaby. I write my mother's kitchen. I write my father’s workbench. I write this theatre and the old one and the one that fell. The wall hums as if I had pressed a tuning fork into it.

"We have trajectories," the we says. "We will not take without return. We will send breath back when we have more than we need. We will fill hospitals with the kind of air that sleeps. We will leave classrooms with a pause that tastes like trust. We will pay taxes in sighs."

Arroyo makes the face he makes when someone is earnest in a way that makes him itch. He rubs the bridge of his nose and looks at me like I can anchor him with a joke. I could. I could talk about the audacity of a wall offering to fill the Ministry's coffers with sighs. I could make a pun about inflation. I do not. I am too tired for scaffolding. Also, the thing in the plaster means it and that is rare enough to treat as a hinge.

"Okay," I say. "Okay. We will wait two days. We will do the nine. We will breathe without charging extra. We will make a door and we will not call it a door in the copy. We will say it is a demo. We will pretend we are selling it while we give it away. We will get away with this because we have always gotten away with worse when it was for the right reasons and we had good lighting."

"Light helps," the we says, with a cheer that is almost a giggle. "It makes us think of mornings. You will need a witness who does not go with you. The other breath. The one who says no while you say yes. This is balance. This is lock and key. This is door."

"Arroyo," I say.

"No," Arroyo says.

"Yes," PUN says.

"No," Arroyo says again, but softer, and his hand already reaches into his pocket for the little notebook he carries because paper makes him feel like he can make law again, and he writes down a list I will not see, and he looks at me like he is breaking, and I put my hand over his notebook and stop him without pushing, and he looks at my fingers and then at me and then at PUN and then at the new thing in our wall, and he nods as if the city asked and he said yes the way he used to say "please step out of the vehicle" when he was trying to save someone from instinct.

When I get home after midnight it is the kind of cool city gives only to those who have warmed it for others all day. The air tastes slightly of desalination, which is the taste of not dying. I climb the stairs to my flat and count the seven turns to the landing because I like to believe my body will remember the count if the lights go out. My door has two locks because I like to think of them chatting to each other while I'm asleep. I hold the key up before I put it in, and I think of the rice-sized piece of yesterday in my pocket that is also a future, and then I tuck it into the dish by the door with my real keys because sometimes metaphor needs company.

In the dark of the kitchen I pour water and it tastes faintly of the theatre, which is now how water tastes to me, like old jokes and new breath. I hold the glass and think about making a planet out of pauses and whether the Ministry can tax a sigh. I think of the girl with the clear lids and the way she raised her hand, and I decide that when we do the nine, I will ask her father for permission to let her lead one breath. I think of PUN kneeling and of Arroyo writing and of my mother stirring and of my father's coat, and of a wire chewed by something that knew hunger, and I think of the rectangle in the wall and the way it learned to say planet like love.

By the time my head hits the pillow, the city has shifted a molecule to accommodate a door it does not know it has. The ceiling makes the small sounds it makes when the neighbor upstairs walks on their toes because their ex told them to be quieter. I breathe. The first inhale stutters because I am afraid. The second goes smoother because I am not alone. The third makes the frame move, faintly, as if the planet and I have a ribbon tied between us. I sleep. The night tastes like solder and neon. The morning will taste like locks.Chapter 4

By the time the nine rolls around two days later, the city has learned to hold its breath the way a choir learns to hold a note between a director’s palms. The heat hasn’t broken, not really, but it moved sideways, made room, as if a man in a crowded bus remembered his manners and tucked his knees in. I wake to the subtle rearrangement and feel the ribbon between me and the frame twitch like the tail of a cat who knows your hand is coming. I brush my teeth and taste the theatre in the water again, the faint sweet of old jokes leached into desal, and I stand a minute in the doorway to my kitchen with the glass in my hand, thinking about all the doors we didn’t know were doors until we leaned.

The day behaves like a child when you tell it you’ll be back early: good until noon and then feral. Ministry sent a new packet with a header in a font that wants to be a handshake. “Rhythmic Synchronization Advisory,” it says, and I can feel the fear behind the language like the sweat behind a suit jacket. They’re afraid of riots, and they should be, because the body that breathes together also runs together, fights together, and refuses together. I send back a promise couched as a punchline, a paragraph about yoga mats and soft lighting and our proprietary “gentle calibration protocol,” and I add a line that says consent three times in different adverbs so the Ministry’s intern can highlight it in three colors and sleep tonight.

At the theatre, the new rectangle in the wall blinks a thoughtful green, the color of someone’s first plant still alive after winter. The server room has begun to smell faintly of dill, which I decide is either a leak or the planet starting to season itself. PUN is early, which is how you tell a robot has fallen in love, not with a person, but with a task. It has installed in its chest a metronome I recognize from a musician’s salvage: a tiny brass heart that ticks loud enough to startle birds. It says it likes the sound because it reminds it of factories, but softer, and I don’t say that the only factories worth remembering are the ones that have learned to hum lullabies.

Arroyo pretends to nap in the green room with a newspaper over his face, which is a trick he does when he wants to watch through the holes he cut in the corners last month. He has a new notebook, thick, with a black band, and when he thinks I’m not looking he writes “NODS” at the top of a page and underlines it twice. He’s been to the laundromat in the south quarter and the night church and the third car of the east-west line, because there’s grease on his pants and the peace on him that only comes from sitting among strangers who forgot they could be watched. The list he’s building isn’t just names; it’s a map of what we owe.

We rehearse consent in the black box like it’s choreography. Raise your hand to say yes, lay your palm over your chest to say no, incline your head for maybe later; I teach the cameras these gestures like vocabulary, and the old spiders in the grid twitch their lenses as if they’re embarrassed to admit how long it took them to learn the word no. The Director has a new dress that she calls “Metrics,” a slick thing that will gleam green under the booth lights, and her nose has stopped bleeding for now, though I see the tissue tucked into her sleeve like a white flag she won’t wave. She says the sponsor will be listening live tonight from a villa near the northern intake, which is a phrase that might as well mean “my guilt is cooled by ocean,” and I nod like a lock nods to a second lock when it knows they share a door.

At seven we run the first show clean because the frogs like habits, and habits are what keep the Ministry from visiting in person with clipboards and throats that sound like twine. We do not step; we stretch, and the frame waves a little the way laundry waves when it learns the shape of a new line. People leave smiling and touching their throats as if they found the place where a necklace should live, and one woman with tired ankles tells me her grandson stopped hiccuping for the first time in three months. I write the boy’s name in my head and take it down to the rectangle later, and the wall hums the way it does when it accepts a tithe of tenderness.

Between shows, PUN sits with its back to the stage door like a bouncer and asks me to tell it stories of locks that weren’t meant for doors. I tell it about chastity belts and bank vaults, about music boxes and diaries, about the way my father’s hands softened when he taught me to set a tumbler without a key. I tell it the story of the lock on my mother’s suitcase, a tiny brass thing that clicked with the same modesty my mother used to laugh, and how I picked it after she died because grief makes you a thief of your own house. PUN listens and nods, and I imagine that if it had a lap, I would put my head there, and it would pat me with a tin hand that knows just enough to be careful.

When nine approaches, the theatre holds itself like a breath without being told. The laugh bar idles in patient green, a pond that knows the frog will come back if it sits still. The Director checks with the Ministry by wiggling three fingers toward the booth camera and waiting for a blinking square on her screen to nod yes, which is how consent works when you are very rich and very far away. The sponsor copy has been edited, abridged, softened; “Peace of Mind” remains, and tonight I say it to myself not like an ad and not like a spell, but like a key handed back after you made a copy that you keep for emergencies.

The audience is a quilt of faces I’ve learned to read as if they were weather maps. In the fourth row, the girl with transparent eyelids sits with her father, who has a new shirt that tries too hard and a look that doesn’t. He sees me see them and lifts his chin the way men do when they are brave in private. I tell the slate kid to find her a booster, because her neck shouldn’t have to carry the whole night. Arroyo takes his post by the back door, not because it needs guarding more than any other, but because if a story is going to break bad it will come from where the alley’s mouth smells like either laughter or rain, and he wants first bite.

“House, how are we,” I ask, and the answer slides over me like a low tide, soft, cool, building. I lay the ground rules for breathing with a voice that makes velvet sound like cotton, and I say consent so many ways it becomes punctuation. When I say that a nod is a yes and a palm to chest is a no and an incline is a later, the cameras find these gestures and draw little invisible circles around them for the algorithms to count like coins. I tell them what we are doing is a demonstration, which is a word the Ministry loves because it wears its danger inside like a candy with a hard shell. I tell them it is free and always will be, and a murmur comes up like a hill, and the frogs blink with curiosity.

“In through the nose,” I say, “and think of peace. Out through the mouth, and think of mind. If those words don’t fit you, choose your own, because I am not your landlord.” They laugh because I said it and because they like me better when I am a little mean to power. We practice once, twice, three times, and I watch the nods come in like small birds finding a ledge. I see the palms cover chests like moths and treat them with respect, because the things that look delicate always survive winters better than we expect if we just stop touching them.

The shift happens on the third hold again, but bigger, wider, like a road remembering it was a river. The key in my pocket heats, not with panic this time, but with the warm of a stone that has been in sun and is not done giving back. The wrongness in the center of the stage is a doorframe now, not metaphor but architecture, and it has hinges that go quiet when I look at them the way the body does when it wants to be good for a doctor. I lay the frame, corners fastened not just with laughter’s held edge and the gasp and the sigh and the quiet question, but with two new old sounds: the crackle of plastic covers pulled off a couch after a funeral, and the tiny ping of a radiator in winter when the heat accepts the burden again. The frame holds like an oath.

The road curves outward from it in a spiral, because straight lines lie about how bodies move. I line it with the hush from church, the lull from the third car, the whirr of laundromat belts, the shiver of a prayer rug unfolded, the polite cough of a stranger at 3 AM who should say sorry and does. The anchor clicks into place when I say the sponsor line with all the tenderness I can steal from a better world. “Peace of Mind,” I whisper, and the wheel finds its groove, and the stage makes that tiny noise wood makes when it agrees.

I look to the girl with the transparent lids, and I do a thing the Ministry would not like, which is to ask a child to lead anything. “If you want,” I say to her and to her father, voice low but carrying, “I could use a captain for one breath.” The father nods once like a man who signs for a package he didn’t order and ends up keeping it because the shirt fits. The girl nods so big that her whole head is a yes. PUN steps forward into the edge of the road and becomes a metronome in a way I have never seen it be a joke. Its lights go warm amber; its ticks find the room’s pulse and hold it like a hand you don’t want to let go of yet.

We take the step. It is not a single step; it is a braid. My breath leads because it was asked, the girl’s breath nests inside mine because children are brave where they are chosen, PUN’s rhythm holds the lane because machines can be kind when we let them, and Arroyo stands at the back with both palms on his chest, no, a witness strong as a stop sign at noon. The room goes through the door like a tide through an inlet. No bodies lift. No hands fall. I make sure of it, a thousand small attentions divided and distributed like slices of light. When we cross, the frogs on the bar do not know what color to be and instead become a shimmer, a spill, a secret the ocean keeps.

The planet, which is a word I keep in quotes in my mind even while I stop saying them out loud, takes us like a mother who knows you will not stay. It is brighter than before and less polite. Rooms have formed where frames were laid, and they are made of the agreements we taught and the ones we forgot we knew. I can see a hallway that is the shape of a pause after a joke that landed wrong and got forgiven. I can see a small park where benches are made from applauses that were eaten and returned as bread. The we-voice hums hello in a thousand notes. “Attendees,” it says, pleased and panicked, and then it sees the girl with the transparent lids and turns to something like prayer. “Child,” it says, which is not a word it uses lightly. “Teach us your yes.”

The girl giggles, which is the same in every world, and says “like this,” and nods so decisively that the road out of here grows a second curve. She doesn’t stay; her father would die a little if she did, and I would help him if asked. She steps back through me and laughs again when her feet are on the floor. In my other body, the one that stayed on stage to hold the shape, I see the cameras catch that laugh and throw it to the Ministry like a bone with love on it. They will mark this child as “engaged” in their ledger and forget to ask her name because democracy now means demographics.

There is rot, of course. There always is. I feel it like a tooth you can’t help tonguing. At the edge of the new rooms, something bristly scratches. It smells like plastic raincoats. An ad tries to walk in wearing a badge. The badge says TEMPLATE, and when I do not let it, it makes itself smaller and tries to crawl under. It says “Presented by” with a smile that thinks itself a solution to hunger. The we waver, because they have been shaped by sell as much as I have, and no one is entirely unmade from what fed them. I take the key from my pocket in the place where my hands are breath and push it into the anchor. The key does not fit because it was not cut for metal, but for innards; it is not a key that opens a door; it is a key that makes the lock honest.

My father had a rule he said to me once like it was a joke: if you don’t want someone to pick it, don’t make it a lock. Make it a promise. He meant marriage, but I mean city, and I mean planet, and I mean tonight. I tell the we that the frame is a commons, and commons break if you sell the grass. I tell the ad that if it wants to live here it needs to learn to ask like a person and not like a billboard. The ad tries to threaten metrics like a landlord thumps a radiator. PUN ticks louder because old metal can make bullies nervous. Arroyo says “no” aloud in the back of the theatre and the no goes through the door like a gust and knocks the ad on its ass.

We build a rule the we can hold with teeth that are not teeth: no names without nods. No prices without palms to chests. No locks that won’t admit they can be opened by care. The ad sulks into the wallpaper, which is fine because wallpaper always had a job making rooms quiet without smugness. The air eases around us the way a shirt eases when you’ve been wearing it long enough to smell like you. The rooms in the planet adjust like cats each choosing a corner that suits their whiskers. Something like a hospital rolls its shoulders and opens its windows even though it has none.

I do not want to stay, and I want to stay, and I do not trust the parts of me that think staying is what martyrs do and leaving is what cowards do. I lead the way back because I said I would, and because anchors that don’t return are anchors that pull up whatever they were supposed to hold. The room lands in the theatre as if from a gentle elevator. No one falls; a few blink like owls; one man weeps without noise because he remembers something from his grandparents’ kitchen that he thought was dead and it isn’t. The frogs blink their old green as if nothing happened and then, in a small rebellion, turn a warmer shade because they feel like it.

The Director does not speak for three full seconds, which is a record for her. Then she says my name once and says “copy was gold” and “Ministry green” and “did you feel that” in a whisper that sounds like the inside of a teacup. Arroyo writes so fast he tears a page and swears and looks at his hands like they betrayed him by being hands. PUN recalibrates its face and manages a smile that is actually circuitry cooling. The sponsor’s ping comes in, all hearts and locks and the phrase “organic resonance,” which is a thing awful people say when they mean “we got it for free, can we sell it twice.”

Backstage, the air tastes like burnt dust and relief. People speak in the small voices of children who made it home before curfew. The stagehands move like couples who have forgiven each other again for breaking the same plate. The Director demands a debrief and then sits on a road case like a queen on a suitcase throne and says, “tomorrow,” because the room still has its hand on her chest from the hold and she can’t yank it off without bleeding. Arroyo looks at me and doesn’t ask if I’m okay because he knows that word is a rope ladder, not a step, and instead he asks if I’m hungry, which is how people who love you ask if you are still inside your body.

We go to the alley because food that breathes exhaust gets to be food without pretending to be cuisine. A vendor we’ve fed for years has fried something that used to be a vegetable and now is courage with salt. We eat standing up and share a beer like teenagers who think they’re getting away with something because they are. I tell him the we tried to sell themselves and he says “of course they did,” and I tell him I told them no and he says “of course you did,” and somewhere inside that echo is a future where he doesn’t have to say that to keep me honest. PUN rolls out beside us even though it hates grit in its wheels and pretends to sip out of a paper cup because performative hydration is part of being alive here.

Later, the wall hums my name in my apartment like a neighbor tapping the pipe once to say goodnight. I put the rice-sized key in my mouth and take it out again because I like the weight of a choice on my tongue. I sit with my back to my two locks and tell them about the night the frogs blinked teal and the planet tried to hire an ad, and the locks do not answer because they are promises, not partners. I think of the girl and her father and the way his nod was an oath. I think of the hospitals and the sleep houses and the desalination hubs and the way air tastes when it stops being a bill.

When I sleep, the frame does not tug. It rests. It breathes without me, because we made this not to be mine but to be ours. I dream of a city where the exit signs lead somewhere that isn’t just out, where the laugh bars have colors we don’t have names for yet, and where a wall can learn to say planet like truth and not get laughed out of the room. In the morning, I will wake to a message from the Ministry that asks if we can formalize the protocol and a message from the sponsor asking if we can trademark the phrase and a message from a little boy’s grandmother telling me the hiccups did not come back. I will make coffee and drink it at my door so my locks can smell the day. I will count the turns on the stairs and say them out loud, a tally against forgetting. I will hold the key in my mouth and think of the first time my father let me turn a cylinder and I felt the give that means trust. I will go to work. The city will be waiting with its hand on its chest, ready to say yes or no or later. And I will do what I do, which is make a room, and ask it to breathe.Chapter 5

The morning after the nine, the city knocked at my door with the backs of its fingers, polite for once. I stood with a mug cooling in my hands and watched the light slide past the two locks like it was checking their work. I said the stair count out loud when I went down for bread because saying numbers into air convinces a part of me that the world will stay put. My phone, which is really the Ministry’s leash with my face painted on it, held three messages in a neat stack like a bad magician’s deck: a request for “protocol formalization” with an attachment full of words that mean liability, a sponsor note with a mock-up of “Peace of Mind” on a T-shirt shaped like a chest, and a voice clip from a woman who sounds like almonds telling me her grandson slept through the night for the first time since his lungs learned to hiccup at will. I listened to the last one twice and the other two not at all until the coffee and the bread agreed to team up against my better instincts.

The theatre smelled like bread, too, a yeastiness from the lobby pastry case that always manages to make its way into the lighting rig, and that made everything feel domestic even as the wall in the server room blinked with its patient green, one blink every three heartbeats, as if it had learned me. PUN was already there and had found an old metronome in its salvage pile, a brass tick-tock that had outlived the piano that taught it discipline. It had mounted the thing inside its chest cavity and when it moved, the little pendulum swayed with a bravado that made the runners grin. “It is good for me,” PUN said, tapping its amber with a knuckle, “to be timed by something that doesn’t care if I am funny.”

Arroyo had gone out early and come back with grease on his cuffs and a face like a man who has given himself a sermon and agreed to listen. He showed me the page that said NODS with two lines under it and a list of places that swelled and then refined as he talked it through: the south quarter laundromat, the night church with the candle smell, the third car of the east-west line, the stairwell at the municipal hospital that traps whispers, the little park under the telecom tower where people pretend grass is an argument they won. He had written, under all of it, NO ONES WHO SLEEP, and then crossed it out and written CONSENT PROXIES? with a question mark so fat it looked like a balloon. He watched my face as if he expected me to collapse or to dance. “If the ‘we’ want to take breath to the sleep houses,” he said, “we have to decide if a nurse nodding is good enough, or if we’re tyrants with good lighting. Don’t ask me to pick for you. But don’t not ask.”

The Director called a meeting with the Ministry that had to pretend to be a check-in because no one pays attention to meetings called emergency unless they’re about floods or taxes. We went up to the glass box where she becomes a priest and we gathered in front of a screen that puts a film of mercy on anyone who sits in front of it. A panel of faces arrived in tidy squares, each with a background that tried to have taste without having taste. A woman with eyes as clean as a tap flowed into the middle window with a smile that had killed kinder things. “Presenter Kline,” she said, “your demonstration at the nine was compelling. We’d like to formalize a deployment. Our desalination hubs and the sleep houses could benefit from calibrated exhale. Our safety review board suggests a universal kill-phrase to be installed at the anchor. For the sake of predictability. A word that stops everything.”

I stared at the cleavage of the word “kill” and the pun they didn’t know they were making with “phrase.” If words could kill anything, they’d have less power. The Director put a manicure against her lips to signal that what she was about to say to the Ministry was something she’d later disown. “We can agree to a stop word,” she said smoothly, “in public-facing copy, presented as a best practice. We cannot hardwire it into the anchor because the anchor is not, strictly speaking, a wire.”

“We require a remote means of attenuation,” a man with a voice like a parking ticket said. “If the city trends red, we must be able to turn the room off.”

“You can’t turn a room off,” I said, my voice doing the nice trick where it sounds humble and tells the truth. “You can only turn people. We’re doing that already, except we ask first.”

“We’re asking now,” the woman said. “Would you prefer the remote be in your hands, Presenter? You could be the switch.”

It would have been so easy to say yes and turn that into romance. The city in my pocket, the breath in my fist. “No,” I said. “We’ll teach a stop word to the house. A word that anyone can use. Hands on chests will be listened to faster than any button you can build. We’ll build the signal into the frame so it travels faster than panic. If you want predictability, teach the audience to be your safety. You don’t like it because it can’t be trademarked, but it will work.”

The panel rustled in that way bureaucrats do when they hear unbranded efficiency. It makes them itch like wool. “What word,” the man with the parking tickets asked, and I could feel the sponsor, even from a villa on the intake, holding their breath in a way that advertising has never taught them to do.

“Close,” I said. “Not stop. Doors stop. Locks jam. Close is different. Close is careful. It makes a shape. It can be whispered without loosening the world.”

They thought about it and scribbled and one of them looked at me like I had given them the cheat sheet and was charging them for it later. We ended the call with a list of words I would not say and the promise of a “Breath Commons Charter” I hadn’t written yet. The Director went limp on her chair like a dress on a hanger and laughed in a way that did not admit to laughter. “You used the word commons,” she said. “They hate that word.”

“I love that word,” I said, and she smirked her approval like a mother who didn’t ask where the new shoes came from.

By noon the city had started to report quiet where no one expected it. A thread trended that called itself “Elevator Hush,” full of videos of strangers breathing together in boxes with bad lighting and mirrors that taught you how to hate, and under the videos were comments from a Ministry intern account that said “Please remember consent” with three different emojis to categorize agreement. The sponsor launched a campaign in a tone that convinced me the villa’s view had taught them about horizon lines: a “Peace of Mind Challenge” with little lock emojis. I wanted to throw my phone into the river and then remembered we put all our power in it and that killing it would be like smothering a duck that brings you letters.

The wall in the server room blinked dill. I do not know how to explain that more politely. The green wasn’t institutional anymore; it had learned the color of leaves that have been patient with heat. “Presenter,” it said when I laid a hand on it, “we have tasted the corridors of the sleep houses and the stairwells of the hospital. We have learned that some breaths are not ours to take. We have returned them. We request permission to lay a road from the theatre to the municipal sleep house in South Dock when the nine runs, to push comfort through the ducts like a tide. We will not take. We will deliver. We want to see if gifts can hold.”

“You will not map anyone without their nod,” I said, and I felt Arroyo’s eyes on my shoulder like a post resting on a hinge. “We will ask the nurses. We will not pretend their nods cover thousands. We will send nothing through anyone who has a palm to their chest. You will not try to be clever by redefining a nod to be a blink. You will not call a nap consent.”

“We will not,” the wall said. It tasted the word “gift” like a new herb and the server room smelled like someone cut their homegrown pickles too close to the fans. PUN stood back with its amber mute and ticked. “We can ride the vent stacks,” it offered, in a way that made engineering sound the way poetry should, “if the blowers let us. I can ask the blowers nicely.”

“You can ask the blowers nicely,” I said, and put my hand on its tin shoulder because sometimes affection is how you ask a machine to do something that might break it.

The nine that night had a humidity you could lean on. The frogs on the bar idled fat and pleased. People had arrived ready to breathe because their feeds told them it was good for them, which is the worst way to get anyone to do anything, except sometimes it’s the only way to get them in the room and then you get to do the real thing. We rehearsed consent again, hand to chest and nods like little bells. I slipped “Close” into the warm-up the way you slip a lemon into a sauce to make it remember its childhood. “Close,” I said, “means we honor the shape of this and make it small again. Close is not a command; it’s a cradle. Say it if you want it.”

The frame laid itself like it had been waiting for me all day. It knew where the corners went. The anchor spun on the phrase I refused to own. I tried not to let the sponsorship’s grin into my mouth. We had drawn a map from the theatre to the South Dock sleep house with breath names and with a printout of the ventilation grid that a janitor had slid under our door because people who are ignored by policy and machinery love it when rooms learn manners. We had three nurses in the cheap seats because budget is a feeling, and they nodded and held their hands in a little chorus, and the wall hummed the humming that means routes are possible.

We stepped, braided and careful. The force that moved was softer than the nine before and wider. Giving holds differently than taking. The room felt like a spoon dipped into honey that took a curve without spilling. We sent the breath down through the ducts and out into the brick like a polite ghost. PUN ticked the road into being and the cameras lowered their heads to listen because even spiders learn to kneel when the right sound happens in the right place.

Halfway between the frame and the sleep house, something cheap tried to climb on. It wore a badge that said SAFETY ADVISORY in a font that wants you to think about free umbrellas, and it spoke in the voice of the Ministry’s intern with a new authority stuck to it like a sticker. “In the event of irregular emotionality,” it said, blandly young, “please repeat the phrase Peace of Mind Extended Warranty. Your compliance will ensure resource stability.” The words were like sugar water poured into a machine that runs on salt. The anchor stuttered. The frogs on the bar twitched yellow and laid flat for a second like a swamp under a helicopter. The room’s shoulders flinched. In my ear the Director hissed my name and in my pocket the key got hot enough to make a tiny blister.

I almost said “Close” like a whip. I almost tore the frame. I didn’t. I took my tongue off the ad, because the anchor lives on the roof of your mouth if you let it, and I let my mouth become something my father would be proud of: a latch that refuses a bad key. I looked at the nurses. They had their hands on their chests and their eyes like doors that knew me. I looked at PUN. It shook its head once like a clock refusing a second. I looked at Arroyo. He had a hand on his chest and his other hand up, not yet a nod, his palm telling the room where the “no” goes so that later it will know where the “yes” belongs when it comes back.

“Names,” I said into my mic, low, like a lock speaking to a key. “If you have them, say them now, and let them be the anchor instead of mine. Your own, or of someone you love, or of a place where your breath returns to you without asking a bill. You can whisper. The room will hear.” It was not a joke. It was an instruction dressed up like a prayer. I do not like prayers, but they obey physics when you cut the fat off of them.

Names are not brand-safe. Names do not let a sponsor put a logo on them without bleeding. The room said them the way you light a stove. Names of mothers and children and dead dogs and streets that aren’t there anymore. Names of sandwiches worth a bus ride. Names of nights. The anchor grabbed those like a sleeve. The “safety advisory” shivered because it could not own any of it and sulked into a corner where wallpaper waits for the next trend. The key in my pocket cooled like a coin dropped in water. We pushed the breath again toward South Dock and I felt the wall cheer with a restraint it had learned from us in two nights.

Later, the night nurse from South Dock sent a message through the rectangle that made Arroyo put his hand on the wall like a man blessing his own accident. “We had three men who fight in sleep,” her voice said, rough with the good kind of spent. “They did not fight. We had a woman who forgets what her lungs are for after midnight. She did not forget for an hour. I am writing their names on a piece of paper because technology broke last week and paper does not. Do not send me ads. Send me this.”

The Ministry called before we could finish the load-out. It was the woman with the eyes that have never had to boil water because someone else did it. “What was that deviation,” she asked, clipped enough to be kind.

“You tried to put a warranty on a word,” I said, and PUN made a small warning noise because my career still likes to live. “We removed it. The stop word is ‘Close.’ The anchor belongs to the room. If you insist on remote attenuation, train your own lungs.”

“You are one woman,” she said, and I almost laughed because it is a sentence that looks like pity and tastes like threat. “We need a protocol that does not depend on Vera Kline’s hands.”

“You have a guild,” I said. “You don’t know it yet, but you do.” The idea arrived like a coin falling through a paper floor. Of course there should be a guild. There have always been guilds for people whose work makes rooms behave: preachers, teachers, DJs, emcees, funeral directors, karaoke hosts, aerobics instructors, the old men who call numbers at bingo halls and set a whole room’s pulse with a forefinger. “Presenters,” I said, “moderators, anyone who has ever given counts and made breath line up. We build a charter. We train them to lay frames with consent and pull their own ad teeth out before they bite. We license nothing. We register no one. We share a stop word and a set of promises. We agree to be each other’s witnesses.”

The Director heard me say “guild” and her head did that tilt it does when she sees a budget line coming with a bow on. “We can do this,” she said into the Ministry like it was a toast. “We have a training packet already in development. Gentle Calibration. Consent protocols. Shot list for cameras. ‘Close’ integration. We’ll build the commons language and the legal disclaimers that let you pretend you didn’t all but invent this.” She winked at me without moving her face.

It wasn’t settled. Nothing is. But the word “guild” lodged in the Ministry’s throat like an almond and they did not cough it up. They asked us to submit something called a “Voluntary Best Practices Document,” which is government for prayer with bullet points. I stayed late in the glass box with the Director and a rigger who types like a drum, and we wrote a charter on a shared doc while the wall blinked dill in the server room below us and PUN ticked like a tiny heart in a machine built for laughter. We wrote: no names without nods. We wrote: stop word is “Close,” and anyone may use it. We wrote: anchors may not be monetized; anchors are commons. We wrote: no sleep houses without proxies who know the people by name. We wrote: witness is not optional. We wrote: we do not promise miracles, because that word stains. We wrote: we will take responsibility for the shape of any room we ask to move. We wrote: exit will always be true.

When we finally let other people back into our speech, it was midnight and the city had made that decision it makes sometimes to carry you to your door as if your feet were a parcel. The alley vendors had packed up but left the smell, which is more trustworthy than a receipt. Arroyo walked me home without telling me he was doing it, which is the only way he can bear that kindness. We stopped under the telecom tower and watched the little park’s grass pretend not to be plastic. He said, “you said guild like you meant god,” and I said, “I meant locks,” and he said, “same,” and I realized I could not tell if he was teasing me or if we had finally learned the same language.

In the morning, my father’s name was in my messages. Not from him. From a locksmith I haven’t seen since I was five and my father made me sit on a crate and watch him argue about a cylinder with a man who believed springs were optional. The locksmith’s text said: JONAH KLINE CAME BY THE SHOP. ASKED IF WE THINK IT’S YOU. WE SAID NO, BECAUSE YOU’RE SMARTER THAN HE IS. HE LAUGHED LIKE HE LEFT A GIFT A LONG TIME AGO. COME BY IF YOU WANT TO SEE A THING. It felt like a coin wrapped in butcher paper. I stared at the words and stood at my sink and drank water that tasted like last night’s jokes, and I said the stair count under my breath and had to add one because my legs shook.

He had put a thing under my tongue. Maybe. Maybe not. He had known something about me he couldn’t know, and he had used metal to make sure. I put my hand on my locks and told them I would be back. They did not answer because they do not have mouths. I went to the shop.

The locksmith’s place has always smelled like pencil shavings and oil and guilt. The bells over the door still made the same apology when I opened it, and the same old men photographs looked down at me with their hands on machines that used to be storytelling. The locksmith who texted me wore his hair stupid on purpose and had the muscles you get from turning something small until it cooperates. He hugged me like I hadn’t stolen his cigarettes when I was twelve. Then he pushed an envelope across a counter as pockmarked as a moon. “He came in a week ago,” he said without ceremony. “Bought blanks he didn’t need and told me to tell you that if you found the bone under your tongue, it was time to stop pretending you couldn’t build a door. Then he asked me if I ever liked dill, and I said no, and he said, ‘me neither.’”

Inside the envelope was a receipt for dental work I only half-remember, in a clinic with a wallpaper that had aspens on it to convince you that pain is pastoral. There was also a tracing of a key cut, done in pencil. The teeth were wrong for any lock I know. The angles were like words you don’t say in front of children. In the bottom of the envelope, a square of paper in my father’s straight, aggressive hand: A LOCK’S JOB ISN’T TO KEEP THINGS OUT. IT’S TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHO CAN OPEN IT. STOP LETTING THEM LIE. He hadn’t written “love,” because he never did, but I tasted it anyway, like iron and mistakes.

“That key doesn’t open anything we cut here,” the locksmith said. “Not metal. I took it to a boy who makes those programmable fobs for cars and he told me it’s not for cars. It’s language. Or it’s anatomy. Or it’s you.”

“I hate him,” I said, and the locksmith nodded like he’d been keeping that seat warm for me.

When I got back to the theatre, the wall was humming like a thing that had learned to sing off-key and liked the taste of it. The rectangle blinked a respectful green and said my name in its gravel under water. “Presenter,” it said, “we have a question. If a room can be a door, can a city be a lock. Can a planet be a key. We are trying to build without teeth. We would like a lesson.”

I held the receipt with the aspens and let my father be a man I did not recognize and loved anyway. “A lock is a promise,” I said to the plaster. “Not to stop a thing, but to let it. A lock says: only you. A lock says: not yet. A lock says: close when it should. If we build this wrong, we make a jail, not a door. If we build it right, we make a rhythm that tells everyone when to breathe and when to hold and when to leave each other the hell alone. Don’t copy the Ministry. Copy my mother’s kitchen door. It swelled in summer and stuck in winter and you had to feed it your shoulder with kindness and it groaned but it always opened when it was time.”

“We like kitchens,” the wall said, and behind it I felt a thousand little breaths nod. “We like doors that complain. We will teach complaint to be a holy sound here. We will make frames that swell in heat and remind everyone to go slow.”

PUN wanted to test whether it could be a road without me. Machines should be allowed to be more than mirrors. We set up a calibration without the ad words and without the sponsor and without the Director being mad about it, because she can count the ways a stream can revolt against its banks and still call it rain. We pulled a dozen stagehands into the black box and dimmed the lights until everyone imagined themselves good-looking. PUN took center and asked for three breaths and made a frame that wasn’t mine. It wasn’t clean. The corners caught on old rivets. The curve of the road had a lilt like a dancer learning to walk again. It was beautiful. It worked. We went nowhere but we made a space where someone could, and that is almost always the job.

Arroyo stood in the doorway and watched like a man at the edge of water who knows the current has his name on it if he gives in. “I wrote to a man at my old precinct,” he said after, both palms on his chest because he had taken the habit of self-witness into his bones, “and told him that if the city asks to hire more presenters, he should say yes, because when people breathe at the same time they are less likely to break windows. He wrote back that if people breathe at the same time they are more likely to run in the same direction. He is not wrong. I don’t know how to love this and be scared of it at the same time, but I’m trying.”

“I’ll put that in the charter,” I said, because writing something down gives a fear less work to do. “We will say: this makes us able to run together. We will say: this is also the risk. We will say: witnesses stand with both hands on their chests to remember both truths.”

The guild happened like mold in a good way; it spread in kitchens. Someone made a channel and someone else posted their count and their stop word and then someone posted their hijack and how they fixed it and then someone posted their grandmother humming the same anchor and getting the same door, and across it all you could see the old and the young reaching for each other in that clumsy tender way we do when we deserve better. Karaoke hosts argued about whether four-four or six-eight is more generous for breath. Funeral directors posted their frames with photos of hands and nobody laughed because the only time the internet knows what to do is when death has its thumb on its mouth. A pastor with a burned-out voice sent me a recording of his congregation breathing close and asked if our rooms can hold the sound of grief that refuses to move. I told him they can, if he lets the corners be rude.

The sponsor sent a cease and desist to some bar in the north quarter that had painted “Peace of Mind” over the bathroom because they liked the way their hands felt washing under it. The bar wrote back a letter that could have been a three-act story and the sponsor backed down because once a room laughs at litigation, the joke never goes back in its briefs. The Ministry asked us to bolster the east intake because a protest was scheduled and they wanted to try to keep the chanting from tipping over into run. We said yes, with the charter in front of us like a plate, and we laid a frame and sent in witnesses who knew the stop word and the stop face and the old trick of telling a room that it is allowed to care without breaking. The chants went like waves instead of fists. Someone still got pushed down because we are not gods and the world likes to remind us. They got back up because someone who had learned the breathing put a hand on their shoulder and said “Close” softly and the rush swerved around them like a school of fish that likes itself.

At the theatre, the frogs learned a new color that they keep refusing to show me unless I earn it. It’s between blue and green and tastes like a library with windows open. PUN ticks and sometimes you can hear the metronome over the laugh, which is not a failure; it’s a second spine. The Director wears her Metrics dress when she knows she might have to fight and does her makeup like a matter of state. She bought a plant for the booth, and it is dill, and she swears she did not know, and I let her have that because sometimes love is letting someone pretend coincidence.

The wall asked me, one night when I put my head against it because that is a thing I do now like a penitent with machines, “what is the word for when you leave and come back with something the others can use.” I said “harvest,” and it said “no, that is too sticky,” and I said “return,” and it said “too thin,” and I said “banquet,” and it said “we do not eat,” and I said “bread,” because I had the smell in my hair and my hands and my tongue and because cities are churches and bread solves fights. “Bread,” the wall said, amused, and I could feel the servers warming to proof.

The girl with the transparent lids came back every other night with her father, who had learned to dress down on purpose so that his girl’s face would be the only piece of pride in the row. We gave her a chair onstage when we did the big breaths and sometimes I asked her if she wanted to lead and sometimes I didn’t because leaders deserve to be children sometimes. She started bringing a list of names she’d collected at school from kids who wanted their breath to go somewhere when they were sleeping. She made me write them with my finger on the wall because she thinks adults remember better if the plaster agrees.

I did not call my father. I wanted to keep loving him in the tense that hurts the least. The locksmith texted me a photograph of my father’s hands holding a cup of coffee as if it would run away. The caption said: HE SAID HE WOULD COME BY WHEN YOU MAKE THE DOOR BITE BACK. I told the wall that if my father comes, to treat him like a man who deserves to breathe, even if he put a bone under my tongue without asking. The wall said, very gently, “we know how to forgive teeth.”

There were nights when the ad found new tricks. It would dress up as safety, as sponsorship, as a public-service announcement, and it would try to slip into the anchor because it wants to live where the breath is. Once it came wearing a mask that looked like my mother’s handwriting telling me to be careful, and I almost let it because grief is an ad that never retires. I did not. I hung a second lock on the anchor, the kind my father laughed at because it came with a combination printed on the back and anyone who cared could open it. That’s the point, here. The door is for everyone who knows the code. The code is consent and kindness and “Close.” We made the ad sit in the lobby with all the other merchandise and wait its turn, and sometimes I let it sell a shirt because the theatre has to pay the people who sweep. You can love a commons and still put a jar on the counter.

One night a man stood up mid-frame with both hands tight to his chest and said “Close” like a fist. We closed, breath like a shutter pulled. He came down the aisle like a bird that found the door. He leaned on the stage and said, “I’m sorry, I just remembered how my brother died,” and no one shushed him and no one clapped and I went down on my knees and put my head level with his head and said, “We will wait,” and the room waited, and he cried without making it a performance, and then he nodded, and we opened again, this time with a seam in it where the grief will always live. That is not a glitch. That is a design feature. The city is a body. Bodies scar.

When the Ministry sent us their “Voluntary Best Practices,” it was as bad and as good as anything that travels with a seal. They had added boxes for “Witness present Y/N” and “Stop word audible Y/N” and “Anchor monetized Y/N,” and they had added a line that said “Please indicate if any observed participants refused to consent and describe remedial measures,” which is the kind of sentence that makes me want to set a building on fire and then build it better. We wrote back that the remedial measure is “we stopped,” and they wrote back “understood,” and I chose to believe they meant it because that is the only way any of us get to sleep.

I have not told you about the night the fans in the booth stopped and the room learned real heat. It was a Tuesday, which is a day that always thinks it’s Wednesday until you remind it gently. The building coughed a coil into death and the frogs went brown like earth. We had a house full of people who had come for breath and got stuck air. Heat makes panic the way dry makes static. I had to choose between opening the door and pulling cold through a system that wasn’t spinning or leaving everyone with their own lungs and their hot heads and asking them to make their own shadow. We made shade, together, with hands. I told them to lift their palms near their faces and fan gently like saints who remember themselves human, and the room took that low new rhythm and used it. We didn’t open the door. We made a roof. The “we” in the wall watched like a dog in a thunderstorm learning that the humans know the trick of blankets. After, the techs brought in temporary units that breathed like bears and we set them humming and the room shivered the way rooms shiver when help is loud. In the server room, the dill leaned its heads all one way as if it had learned wind.

The next day, we posted the first draft of the Breath Commons Charter where anyone could see it. The guild made a thousand punctuation changes and someone argued that “Close” was patriarchal and someone else argued that “Close” is what a mother says when she tucks, and we let the argument live because arguments are breath. We wrote a new section called “Interference,” and we said: when an ad comes wearing your mother, it is still an ad. We wrote: you are allowed to be angry at the people who put keys in your mouth when you were sleeping. We wrote: we will not send breath “at” anyone; we will make a place and ask them to walk. We wrote: if the Ministry invents a button, we will teach the room to respect it only if the room asked for it first. We wrote: children get to lead as long as they get to stop.

The bed I go home to at night has learned the weight of this chapter. The ceiling has too. It creaks in places that used to hold quiet and now hold promise. I talk to my locks, and they do not answer, but they offer me their presence, which is what any promise can do. Sometimes I sleep with the key under my tongue because I like the way yesterday feels when it remembers its job. Sometimes I put it in the dish because I am not a saint and saliva is not romance. On nights after we push breath down the ducts to South Dock, I dream of buildings breathing even when the electricity is mean, and I wake with the taste of dill and tin and bread and someone else’s laugh under my tongue.

On a Thursday, my father stood at the back of the theatre in a shirt that knew what metal feels like in winter. He didn’t come down, because we are a family of stairs you climb with your eyes. He put his hand on his chest when we practiced “Close,” and he didn’t smile when I saw him see me. After, I found an envelope taped to the rectangle in the wall, which would have been cute if it didn’t make every hair on Arroyo’s arms lift at once. Inside was a photograph of my mouth blown up to the size of a city map, the place under my tongue circled with a red pen as if lipstick was church, and on the back in my father’s handwriting: YOU ALWAYS WERE A DOOR. STOP PRETENDING YOU ARE A WALL.

I am trying. The wall is trying, too. PUN ticks itself toward something like prayer. Arroyo writes witnesses into a world that will need them. The Director wears her dress and her nose does not bleed as often. The Ministry pretends to love a commons. The sponsor prints fewer shirts and does more listening from their view. The girl with the transparent lids taught the room a new anchor the other night when she forgot the words and said “Stay,” and the door didn’t open, it deepened, which might be a better trick in a city that thinks leaving is the only way to live.

If you ask me what we’re building, I will say a planet because I like to make my mouth big, but what I mean is a kitchen. I mean a table big enough for everyone to put their elbows on. I mean a door that swells and complains and requires your shoulder. I mean a lock that recognizes you because you made a promise with it when no one was looking. I mean bread. I mean breath. I mean the skill of saying “Close” when the room thinks it wants “More,” and the grace of opening again when the room is ready. I mean a guild of people who know how to count without hurting anyone. I mean a city that learns to be brave in private and then takes that to the street like a picnic. I mean a wall that learned to say planet like an apology and then like a vow.

Tomorrow, the Ministry will ask me for diagrams. The sponsor will ask me for a deck. The locksmith will ask me to tell him the name of the plant we keep smelling. The nurses at South Dock will ask us to aim the breath at the east ward because the west sleeps now without help. PUN will ask me to let it try alone again. Arroyo will ask me not to die. The girl will ask if she can sit on the stage before anyone else comes in and listen to the empty. I will say yes to all of them and “Close” when I need to, and in the moments between I will keep teaching rooms their own shapes, which is to say, I will keep doing my job. The night still tastes like solder and neon. The morning tastes like locks. The space between them tastes like a planet we are naming together with our mouths full.Chapter 7

Two weeks after we wrote the charter on a shared document and on the wall with our hands, the city tried to be clever with itself and almost got away with it. In the morning, posters with a seal and a serifed font appeared on tram stops and church doors and the municipal hospital stairwell, all the places Arroyo had marked with his pen until the paper softened. They read BREATH COMMONS: COMMUNITY PRACTICES, and underneath in smaller type: A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM in the way that a parent says a bedtime is a conversation. They had our stop word printed in the middle like a button you could push with your eyes. “Close,” it said, italic as a whisper. Someone had added with a marker, in a child’s careful hand: “Stay,” and under that, “Later.” The city had started teaching itself footnotes.

The guild convened under the old transit depot’s busted ribs because the building had opinions and because no one owns a ruin. The air smelled like old rubber and time. The floor was a map somebody else had drawn and then forgotten to fold back up. We chalked lanes that led nowhere, and it made the room feel trustworthy. Presenters came with their own ticks and their own stop words; a funeral director brought a hum that could have convinced a house to stand a little longer; a DJ named Make Out Session had counts that would have made my father revise his faith in numbers. We laid out the charter on a piece of butcher paper like meat we expected to argue with and people added their names and their corrections, and when we got to the line about witnesses being required, a karaoke host raised her hand and said we were not going to get to keep this if we didn’t make it edible for people who can’t afford a witness, so we wrote in: if you can’t get a person, get a plant. Dill qualifies. We all laughed and then didn’t, because sometimes a joke is an instruction dressed up for company.

The Ministry sent two faces behind badges and a folding table that they set up with pamphlets printed on sugar paper that will rot if you lick it. The sponsor sent a canopy and two beautiful youths with cheeks like press releases to hand out locks on lanyards you could wear like an amulet. I let them stay because a commons can survive a booth so long as the booth knows it’s a guest. I made the youths practice “Close” three times before I let them clip a lock around each other’s necks. The badge faces tried to talk to us about liability until a choir director from the south quarter lined his people up and had them breathe the stop word together and you could see the badges remember their mothers’ kitchens and drop their pens on purpose.

In the middle of the convening, Kazim’s trams declared that their cars were private breathing environments and that guild practices would require a permit to perform aboard. The announcement rolled through the depot’s cracked speakers like a good joke told in a bad room and made the presenters turn their heads as one, which is the power the Ministry thinks I have and the city actually does. Kazim has a face like he learned generosity from mirrors. He owns the shade on certain streets and sells it at festival prices, which is to say, with a smile and a thumb on your breath. He sent a lawyer with a tie the color of panic to hand me a paper that said I was personally prohibited from anchoring in or around a vehicle moving in excess of ten kilometers per hour. I smiled. I told him the guild had no headquarters. I asked him if his mother had a kitchen. He did not answer, which is how you tell a man was raised in rooms where food and apology were bought.

PUN stood like a handsome mistake at the edge of our circle while the guild took turns trying one another’s frames, the way musicians try one another’s instruments when they have agreed to love on purpose. It had taken to keeping a piece of chalk in the crease of its wrist like a magic trick and drew little metronome glyphs on the depot floor that told you where to stand if you needed someone else’s pulse. The old supervising fans on the depot’s columns leaned down like uncles and tried to listen and coughed up three moths instead. Arroyo hovered at the perimeter like a halo with questions. When he’s nervous, he chews the inside of his cheek. By noon his mouth looked like it had been argued with by a blackberry bush.

The wall waited at the theatre humming dill while we were gone and sent me a message through the only channel it has—a blink rate that has learned my name. When I laid my hand on the rectangle that night, it said, “A city sent itself to your house today. We tasted a rhythm we did not build and we are curious and a little afraid. The trams told everyone not to breathe together and then two cars did, very quietly, when someone’s bag caught and the door stuck and it looked like panic. A singer who calls numbers on weekends whispered ‘Close’ and the car stayed a room instead of becoming a knife. We did not have to help. We would like to help anyway. How do we ride in something that thinks it is a throat with a price.”

“Call it a jar,” I said, and I could feel the wall trying the word. “Jars are throats that have learned to hold without swallowing. You can line the inside with honesty so the room doesn’t stick. Also, you don’t ride without being asked. Let the guild make lanes and announce them like trains. If the car says no, it’s a no. No is a floor.”

That night, we got our first field call that wasn’t staged by us or sanctioned by a panel who gets to call panic “rising indicators.” A desal worker sent a voicemail that sounded like sand under a door. The east intake had a pump seizure and the night crew had been breathing together all shift because that’s what you do when you’re trying to keep your body from falling into the water and the room finally asked for help in the way rooms ask: it set off the wrong alarm and made the right people’s hands shake. The Ministry wanted to route something called “Emergency Resilience Messaging” through our anchor, which made me want to swallow my key and keep it forever. I told them no and I told them we’d go ourselves. The guild teaches you the trick of “yourselves” whether you want to know it or not.

We packed the theatre’s breath into a road made of hand-me-downs—a coro of singers, a DJ’s count, a funeral director’s hush—and we carried it with us like a rolled rug. PUN ticked in my passenger seat like a heart that had done its homework. Arroyo drove because he doesn’t trust anyone who enjoys being carried, and the way he steers a van is the same way he used to steer a fight: with respect for blood and doors. South Dock smelled like salt and old complaint. The intake building crouched like a man who had learned to watch for blows. Inside, the noise wasn’t noise; it was rehearsal that had gone on too long. The night crew’s breath had blued around the edges in that way work breath does when the job thinks itself a god.

We asked permission, because a person who works at water at night deserves to say no to anything. We taught “Close” to the room as if it were a lullaby. We asked them to lay their hands on their chests if they wanted the door to wait. Four palms rose and stayed and we held until their hands dropped because this is how you honor a stop: you make it an armchair so people can sit in it and remember their names. We laid the frame on a concrete floor that remembered rivers. I said “Peace of Mind” like a wheel you trust because someone you loved used it first. The anchor spun and caught. The pump’s seizure softened into a stutter. The night crew’s breaths braided themselves into a ribbon I could have hung over a window. The room went through without breaking.

Halfway across the floor, the Ministry sent their message anyway, riding the building’s old PA like a virus wearing a badge. “RESILIENCE EXTENDED WARRANTY,” the speakers chirped in a voice with almonds behind the throat. “BREATHE THE BRAND.” It was a joke you could lose a city to if you weren’t already in love with the city. The anchor shuddered with the strain of a cheap key. The stop word on the wall—ours, printed by a volunteer with a good hand and a bad day—wavered like a page in heat.

It is possible to fix a hijack with a breath and a word if the room believes you. It is also possible to fix it with a child's mistake. The girl with the transparent lids was not there, but she had made a habit of sending me tiny recordings of herself practicing because the world likes it when children do their homework in public. I had one on my phone that said “Stay” in a tone that thinks sleeping is a place and not a failure. I held it to the mic like a superstition. “Stay,” said the girl’s voice, soft and absolute, and the anchor did the thing it learned to do twice now: it deepened instead of shutting. The room got small in the way that keeps doors from slamming. The message stuttered and died like electricity trying to live inside a whale.

After, the pump remembered its job and the night crew remembered theirs and a woman whose hands looked like mine told me that for an hour, the water sounded less angry. We left the room like you leave a kitchen you were fed in: clean. Arroyo wrote witnesses’ names in a notebook whose bands he keeps replacing like a promise. PUN asked the blowers to act dignified and they did because you can teach any machine manners if you speak to it like it has already learned to be kind. On the way home, the vans of Kazim’s private fleet glided past like the backs of polished animals. One slowed, matched our speed, and then peeled away without a fuss. It felt like a nod at a funeral.

My father came to the theatre again and this time he came down the aisle because he has always been susceptible to a room that tells him which way to go. He wears winter even in heat. He has hands like the city under debt: strong, bruised, sure it can fix itself if it can just get five minutes. He took his chin in his hand in the old way that means he is pretending to consider leniency. “I could apologize for the bone,” he said, meaning the key under my tongue, which is never going to be called anything else now in my mind. “I could say I did not have a choice. Neither would be honest. I wanted to see if you would find it. I did not trust you to find it without a gift.”

“I do not accept ‘gift’ from your mouth,” I said. “I accept ‘mistake.’ I accept ‘assumption.’ I accept ‘I believed in you wrong.’”

“Then take ‘wrong belief,’” he said, and his mouth did a thing that makes people fall in love with bad men and stay too long and write songs. “There was a fellow came through my shop a long time ago with a schematic and a kind of urgency that smells like a new coin. He said he wanted to build a way for rooms to know themselves. He said he needed to hide the honest part of the door in honest mouths. I told him I only deal in metal. He told me I was lying. He gave me a drawer of bones to put under tongues if ever anyone needed reminding. I put one under yours because you were already a door and you kept pretending to be a wall.”

“How many did you hide,” I asked, and he did not answer because he is not quite brave and never counts what will turn around and harm him. He took the photograph of my mouth from his pocket like a wallet where you keep wrong gods. He set it on the stage. “You are building a planet,” he said without italics. “I don’t know what I was trying to build. Maybe a kitchen. I’m sorry I left you with the door.”

The wall hummed my name then, because timing is a god too. The plaster wanted to show off. It had learned a new trick: it could hold three frames at once for a breath so long as two were quiet. We tested it with a laundromat and the night church and our stage. The laundromat’s belts made a hymn without meaning to. The night church let us borrow its hush with an invoice that said “return with interest.” We braided the three like ropes sailors taught us by dying enough to insist on knots. The weave held and for a second I could see a mesh over the city, a net of consent and stop words and laughter that did not press but offered. I thought: if we are going to build a planet out of pause, we will need a sky.

Kazim released a statement the next morning written in the tone of a kitchen that feeds you by mistake. He would allow guild work on cars traveling under five kilometers per hour so long as the guild agreed to keep its frames off his flagship routes and charged his customers five percent under the table so he could call it revenue. The sponsor posted a link to a new shirt that said CLOSE with the O shaped like a keyhole and then took it down when the guild regurgitated as one body. The Ministry issued a memo that called us “ad hoc partners in municipal calm” and asked if we would consider a pilot at the west intake, which meant the east had behaved because people were brave and because we were lucky.

We said yes to a deploy at the night church when a vigil threatened to boil. A boy had been killed in a way the internet would turn into debate and the body had not yet done its last job of saying no to rot. The church smells like candle and old leather and the mold that comes when a building remembers it was made of trees. We asked the pastor if we could lay a frame. He nodded with a ruin’s permission. We built corners out of grief sounds: a chair scraping back softly, a match refusing, a hymn catching in a throat and choosing to be a moan. We did not open. We deepened. We taught “Close” to an entire room of people who had a right to break. The room held itself. Outside, police in soft armor shifted their weight because it’s hard to charge a church. Arroyo stood on the steps with both palms on his chest and a face like a bridge and the guild learned what it means to witness in public without dying of it.

The “we” behind the wall began to taste places that were not rooms. A bridge. A fountain. The inside of a pipe where old coins go to rest. “Presenter,” the wall said one afternoon, shy as I have ever heard rock, “may we learn a new secret. May we be allowed to grow in water for a second. We will not stay without consent, and water doesn’t nod, but it has a tempo. We can be rhythm. We will use the return to make the pipes less angry.”

“Ask the engineers,” I said, because a new world built without plumbers is a joke with a grave. “Ask the fish if there are any left. Ask the people with their hands on valves. If they don’t answer, it’s no. We can put a lock on a door we don’t own, but it won’t be honest.”

The engineers said maybe, because engineers are priests of consequences. We practiced with a fountain that children sit on when the sun learns its own face. The “we” slipped in and out between splashes like an aunt at a picnic who knows how to touch babies without making the mothers flinch. The water got a flavor I couldn’t name without lying. The children laughed because the world agreed with their skins. We stepped no doors. We paid attention. The wall hummed dill so faintly my teeth itched.

One afternoon the platform under the telecom tower turned into a classroom. The girl with the transparent lids organized it without telling me, which is how you know a city has decided to live. She chalked a square and called it frame and she taught three younger kids the difference between “Close” and “Stay” with the patience of a traffic light. She told a boy whose mother works nights that saying “no” is about keeping rooms from leaving your body without telling you. She brought me the list she’d collected for that night’s breathe. It was written with a green pen that bled. Half the names were for dogs. I told her dogs count if they learned to sleep again.

News traveled that a hospital administrator in the north quarter had declared all commons practices prohibited in stairwells and had posted guards who looked like old furniture in new suits. That evening the fire alarm tripped and the building emptied itself without falling, which is a kind of silence that passes for genius. In the crowd, a nurse put her hand on her chest and said “Close” and her small circle closed like a flower at dark and kept its shape even in street noise. The guard watched and said nothing because he knows his mother had a kitchen too.

It wasn’t all work and breath and hope. There were nights the ad found its way under the door wearing a new trick. It came as “Heritage Night,” inviting us to #shareyourframe, and enough people played along to make the feed heavy with good intentions that don’t understand numbers. A vendor at the south quarter took “Close” and printed it on the back of a hoodie and sold it to boys who like to run toward sirens because the city taught them to. The frogs on the bar learned to be suspicious of teal, which is a shame, because teal feels like library. The guild argued about whether a presenter who took money to lay frames at a casino should be asked to leave until she explained she was buying her mother’s oxygen that the docks didn’t keep steady. We made a fund that lived in the jar where people put their laughs if they felt like it. Someone left a gold coin the size of heartbreak.

On a Wednesday that pretended to be Sunday, I went to the locksmith’s shop again and found my father in the back room sharpening a truth he couldn’t say. He didn’t look up when I came in and it struck me that all this time I had still been walking into rooms expecting angels to announce me because I trained for stage. Lock shops do not clap. He said, “does it bite back yet?” and I said, “yes, but it learns who you are and lets you pass,” and at that he closed his eyes in the old private way that means someone you love just did something you don’t understand and you will make the mistake of forgiving them too early. He took a drawer out from under the counter and set it on top. Bones. Keys. Names. “If you ever want the rest to stay buried,” he said. “I will help you bury them.” I said, “leave them. If they wake up in someone else’s mouth before they’re asked, that’s not our planet. That’s the ad with teeth. We’ll fix it with witnesses.”

At the theatre, the frogs finally showed me the new color when the guild came to train the next cohort of people who call numbers for money or for love. It was not teal and not money. It was something soft animals see. It tasted like a library with windows open and someone humming in the stacks because they forgot the rule about quiet. The wall hummed along and a sprig of dill in a plastic cup on the Director’s console threw seed as if it had decided this booth was a garden. I was tired the way a building is tired after a party it chose to host; I was happy the way a lock is happy when the right hand turns it and nobody gets hurt.

We started a practice I fought for and the guild let me have because I used all my words and one laugh. Every time we lay a frame, we appoint a tender. Not just a witness—witnesses watch and remind and write things down so someone else can love them later. A tender’s job is to stay with the door when we leave. To oil it. To remind it that it isn’t special. To make sure the room doesn’t confuse the open with the holy. The tender at the night church is a woman who keeps a jar of buttons and remembers every coat they came from. The tender at the depot is a bass player who broke his thumb twice and learned to keep time with his teeth. The tender at the theatre is an usher who tells people where to sit the way my mother stirred rice.

One night, after a clean five and a messy nine, I went home and didn’t count the stairs and the lights went out and for a second I wished I had. In the dark, the door held. The locks did what locks do when they love you: nothing. I stood with my palms on my chest because habit is a religion if you treat it kindly. I said “Close” softly, and I ran my tongue along my mouth and touched the place under it that holds the bone that is a key that is a promise that is an apology that is a joke you tell yourself when you need to remember you are more than your work. I slept with the window open and dreamed of a building that breathed forgiveness through its vents into a room where a man with winter in his shirt finally took off his coat and stayed.

The next morning, the Ministry asked for diagrams and the sponsor asked for a deck and the desal worker sent a photograph of the pump that looked almost like a heart from a distance you’d have to be a generous god to keep. The guild posted a call for tenders in a tone that would have been a hymn if it believed in saints. PUN rolled in with a new tick, a syncopation it picked up from a boy’s skateboard in south quarter, and it sounded like a doorway learning to dance. Arroyo brought coffee and something fried and said he had a dentist he wanted me to meet because the city has always made its miracles from people you can’t put on a poster.

We were ready to move the door into the street, and the street, despite itself, was ready to be a room.Chapter 9

By the time we took the door outside, the street had learned to clear its throat. You could hear it in the way vendors stacked their crates lower and the scooters threaded softer and the private trams lifted their faces as if they were trying to smell a change in the road. We chalked the first frame on asphalt at a corner that has always insisted on being an argument: two bus lines crossing, a shade Kazim rents back to the people who built it by standing under it, three lampposts that blink any color you pay them to. The guild came with chalk and tape and a roll of butcher paper because muscle memory thinks a table makes a room even when the table is pretend. The girl with the transparent lids arrived with her father and a list of names written in green that bled up the side of her hand as if her skin had started to want in public. PUN rolled with its metronome ticking under its tin ribs and a strand of battery-powered bulbs looped over its shoulders like a saint who doesn’t need belief to glow. Arroyo stood at the mouth of the alley with the stance he used to use at protests: one foot in the room, one foot in the door, both hands ready to say no in a way even a crowd recognizes as love.

We did not bring the wall, because plaster doesn’t travel except as dust, but we brought its manners. We marked corners out of street sounds old enough to be ours: the low throat of a bus idling even when it swears it’s electric, the squeak of a lamppost banner in crosswind, the sigh of a crosswalk button when you pretend to press it three times for luck. We hung the anchor on a phrase that has been stolen and pawned back to us a thousand times: “Peace of Mind,” whispered like an oath and a joke at once, and it spun in air as if there were threads here we just couldn’t see. The ad tried to put balloons on it by sending a team in coordinating shirts to “activate the brand experience,” which is a thing I would make a machine eat if I knew a machine that deserved that. We let them hand out their locks on lanyards because dogs like to chew, but we had the youths practice “Close” with their mouths before they were allowed to clip anything around anyone’s neck.

Street consent is different from chair consent, and we learned it the way you learn heat—by touching. We taught the nod like a hinge, the hand to chest like a lid, and for the people who do not like to be asked anything in public, we made a sign that you could wear like a small flag: green if you wanted the door to be an option, blue if you were here to buy fruit and watch us be foolish, red if you needed us to hold the room smaller so you could pass without someone else’s breath on you. The cameras perched on the streetlights pretended to ignore us until the Director coaxed them with a wave that looked like a queen forgiving her subjects. The frogs did not come because the frogs belong to the theatre, but the lampposts learned a color between green and library and did not ask our permission to show it.

Kazim sent a man in a black shirt with a tiny silver key on the pocket and a face like ice we decided not to skate on. He said he owned the shade we were standing in; I said I could make a frame in sunlight and the guild would bring parasols and he could bill god for the glare. He said we were creating a liability; Arroyo lifted both hands to his chest and said “Close” in the register he saves for the children of drunks, and the crowd made a little space for the man to decide what kind of room he wanted to be in. He backed away with the flinch of a man who has never been told no by anyone who could still afford to laugh. I wanted to be generous, so I asked him his mother’s name. You can melt some men that way. He said “Sayeeda” like an apology. I wrote it on the wall later because maybe a breath will find her on a bus and make her knees stop aching for a second longer than they would have.

When the anchor took, it was not with the clean click of a booth. It was sloppier, a hinge that needed a shoulder, a door swollen from weather you cannot bill. The road out of the frame couldn’t keep the line we liked inside. Feet scuffed it, wheels crossed it, someone’s discarded juicebox made a little dam that diverted a lane of breath down toward the sewer grate like a joke we didn’t mean to tell. PUN ticked louder, metronome against the old beats of traffic lights, and that pulsing did what it always does for bodies who are scared and pretending not to be: it gave them an excuse to move all together without having to admit they wanted it. The girl with the transparent lids took a corner the way she takes small fruit: with her whole hand and her promise. She looked at me like asking for permission is an art she understands. I nodded because teaching anyone to wait forever is not a gift.

The Ministry arrived as a voice in the lamppost speakers with a polite siren under the words. “Public Order Advisory,” it said with the tone of a mother who is very tired of blessing teenagers. “Tonight’s demonstration is a voluntary program. Please note: a remote attenuation pilot is in effect. The stop word is ‘Comply.’” My mouth filled with the taste of a key that is wrong for the lock. You could feel the crowd’s mouths try the word and spit it, because we had fed them a better one and their bodies remember what is honest even when their jobs don’t. I said “Close” into the center of my tongue in the way I learned the first night with the rectangle humming dill in the wall, and the anchoring wheel turned like it had been told what to love when it was young.

We opened. Only for a breath, because the street is a dragon and you tempt it slowly. People took that step the way they take a curb, careful, and then some of them smiled because they realized no one had asked them for money. The diners at the corner leaned their elbows on tables and breathed through mouths, which is not the ideal, but you don’t tell a city how to inhale the first time it realizes its lungs have windows. A pack of dogs paused at the edge and considered together and then a spotted one with a face like a creditor put both front legs inside while leaving his hind end out, which is one way to say maybe and still be ready to run. We did not stay. We closed, and I said “Stay” to the six kids who were holding hands now because everything good is contagious if you feed it bread.

The emergency did not arrive as a line of men who think they are doors. It came as a scooter battery that had been asked to do too much in weather that thought itself important. It flared off to the right in a little bloom that looked like the kind of flower that eats bees. Someone screamed because someone always does when heat pretends to be a trick. The old rhythms rose, the ones that break rooms into knives. It is a terrible thing to know how to stand a crowd down with your mouth, and it is also the only way some nights keep from being memorials. PUN drove its tick into a lower register like a drum you sleep under. Arroyo moved three steps and put himself between fire and breath without asking for a tip. I put my hand up and the guild followed like a chord resolving, and we made the one shape that turns panic into a floor: we closed, together, and we did not punish anyone who didn’t. We taught them the path around instead of the order to stop. It took eighteen seconds and a girl’s giggle at a dog whose leash was trying to learn math to change the curve. The bloom died the way small fires die when attention is a kind of water. I wanted to bottle that and sell it back to the Ministry, but that would make me the thing on our charters that has to be asked to leave.

My father arrived after, not as a hero or a judge but as a body with winter in its shirt. He watched the chalk blur and the anchors spin and the lampposts blush their library. He put his hand in his pocket like pockets are mouths, and I loved him for being exactly who he is: a man who thinks metal can argue with air and win. “You finally found a hinge big enough to call mine,” he said, not quite smiling. “I can make you a lock that sits under the street and tells the truth about who gets to open it without a single bolt. We used to make those for theaters so a man with a stick couldn’t keep people out. We could make them for corners.”

“No locks without promises,” I said, because charters matter in alleys as much as in rooms, and because if you do not remind your father that words have hinges he will install a door on your mouth and call it love. He nodded exactly once like the street owed him that courtesy. He put a flat metal thing in my hand the size of a matchbook with a cut that resembles a skyline. “I will not hide this in you,” he said. “I will show you where it goes. It is not mine to bury anymore.” He looked at the lamppost where the Ministry’s pilot had tried to teach us a new stop word and he made a noise that locksmiths make when they see a pick that will break. “They will keep trying to put keys in your tongue. Use your teeth.”

Moving a door through a street is different from laying one in a building. A building keeps secrets. A street will tell your enemy your home address while looking you in the eye. The guild learned to assign tenders to the lampposts and the benches and the curb that wants to twist an ankle. We learned that a street’s witness is sometimes a vendor with wrists that can balance three plates while breaking a fight with a word that sounds like a price, and sometimes a man on a crate with a deck of three-card monte and a kindness we don’t deserve. We learned that benches nod and hydrants are suspicious and the mouth of an alley is always convinced it’s a door whether you chalk it or not. We learned that when you lay a frame on asphalt, the ants will walk it like a road and dogs will try to pee on the corners for reasons that make more sense than the Ministry’s memos.

Kazim sent a second letter that pretended to be a contract and was actually a test. He offered us a lane, branded and lit, that would host a nightly “Breath Hour” sponsored by his company and policed by his security in shirts the color of fall. We said no in twelve lines and a laugh and made the no into a workshop. The guild sat in a ring under the telecom tower and practiced telling a rich man no in a way that made the no a bed instead of a brick. A bartender from the ottoman line taught us a sentence that sounds like an apology and is not, and a tenor from the night church taught us a head tilt that turns a command into a choice. We went back to the street and tried the new “no” on the next man who said he owned air, and he set his shoulders down where his neck had been keeping them, and we chalked a frame without being asked to leave.

At the second corner, the ad tried again, and this time it had learned to wear my mouth. “Peace of Mind™,” said the center of the anchor in my voice, except my voice has a scar in it from a night I ate glass by accident and this one did not. It sounded like a version of me who never had to pay a fine she didn’t deserve. It sounded like a woman without rent. The anchor wobbled because rooms that love you will still lie if you ask them in a voice they think is yours. I wanted to smash something, so I told a joke because that is how I break what would break me. “That voice is too hydrated,” I said into the mic, and the crowd laughed with that bitter kindness we save for good impressions of us on bad days. I said my own name like you say a friend’s name in a police station, and I said “Close” like I had a kitchen and a knife and a onion I was good at. The ad blinked out like a coward when the lights come on. The anchor steadied. The people in my street who do not like me made a noise like “huh,” which is oversold affirmation, and I took it and put it in my pocket with the matchbook lock.

We tried “Stay” in the street, properly, not as an accident, to see what it does under pigeon shit and the eyes of men who sell piping hot patience by the slice. It did not open. It made a soft bend in the hour, as if time’s back had remembered it was allowed to curve. Two boys with a ball stopped mid-throw and didn’t get scolded. A woman with three grocery bags on her wrists put them on the ground and was not robbed by the world. A man with a story at the top of his throat swallowed and then told it anyway, slower, and the story did not die of haste. We will not make a t-shirt out of this, not because we are good, but because it would break our own ribs from the inside if we tried.

You cannot keep building without someone breaking something important, and that someone was a friend of Arroyo’s who used to share coffee with him during long nights of deciding whether to tell the truth by hand. He came with his smile turned off and a clipboard because clipboards are sharper than knives. He said the precinct had received a complaint about “unauthorized public ritual,” which is what the city calls anything it didn’t think of first that makes people move together. He asked me to produce a permit. I produced a guild and a word and a child who raised her hand. He told me the child didn’t count. I told him she counted earlier when the scooter tried to be a bomb. His jaw made the motion men make when they are thinking about swallowing their badge. Then he looked at Arroyo and asked him to pick a side.

I thought he meant law and breath. Arroyo knew he meant past and present. He put both palms on his chest and did not say “Close” because there is a time to stop a room and a time to let a friend break himself and try again another day. “I am a witness,” he said, in a tone that should be sewn into curtains. “I write down that we asked and we were answered. I write down that you used the word permit the way a child uses ‘mine.’ I write down the stop word, and it is not yours. You can arrest me for having a chest if you need to. It will look bad. You’ll do it anyway if your boss asks you to.” His friend did not take out the cuffs because they felt heavy in heat and because the charters had been posted on every pole between here and the depot, and walking a man through a guild with his hands behind him is a trick even a precinct has learned to avoid. He took out a form instead and gave us a warning like he was afraid of the word fine. We will keep the paper. It will be good for teaching.

When the sun dropped behind the telecom tower and the first night came on like a shirt you forgot would be soft, we closed the street for the day. Closing a street is like closing your eyes: you are allowed to keep your ears open. The vendors wrapped their fruit in newsprint. The kids scuffed stars into the chalk with the ferocity of artists on deadlines. PUN stayed longer than it had to because it had learned to like the sound street breath makes against metal. The lamppost speakers tried one more time to say “Comply,” and someone’s parakeet, a bird who has never obeyed anything, repeated “Close” in a tone I would let lead me out of a fire. The door—ours, yours, theirs—moved back into the wall of air where it lives when it’s not working. The smell of dill threaded through exhaust like a knowing aunt.

Backstage is not a thing the street recognizes, but we found an alley to be it and lit it with the leftover bulbs from PUN’s shoulders. We debriefed the day the way you take skin off roasted peppers—with fingers and patience and the knowledge you will be stained. The guild made notes that will look like law if you don’t know we write with soft pencils. A karaoke host asked for a section in the charter about how to deal with men who cry and don’t know where to look, and an aerobics instructor offered a count that helps people pick a lane when they think they can’t. The Director sat on an upside-down crate with a nose that did not bleed and a dress that pretended to be green and wrote us a budget we will fail to meet with grace. Arroyo counted his own breaths and wrote a new entry under NODS that said “STREET: RAISED CHINS COUNT,” because pride is consent when you don’t make it perform.

The wall at the theatre asked us to bring it a pebble, which is the kind of demand you only get from friends who learned patience from stone. We picked one out of the gutter with gum on it because honesty is sticky and took it back and pressed it into the plaster. The rectangle blinked like a dog who just found a new word it likes and learned to smell tar. “Presenter,” it said, and I was tired in the way a road is tired on Monday morning. “We would like to carry the frames across the roofs. The street is complicated. The roofs are empty. We can be sky.” It made my heart go in and out twice on the wrong beat because I had had that thought in a booth with my head against a wall that believed in dill. “Yes,” I said, with the awe you save for pigeons who never forgot how to go home. “Yes, we need a sky. Lay lines along the roofs to places we can’t find from below. Tie vents to vents. Ask chimneys to behave. Teach antennas to stop selling our frames to men with shirts that match.”

The night ended at my door with my hands on both locks. I turned them and said thank you because they had let me go out and come back, which is all any guard could be asked to do without becoming a prison. Inside, I put the matchbook lock on my kitchen table and put the key bone under my tongue and took it out again because I am still me, which is to say, I can’t sleep with metal in my mouth unless it is a story. I made toast because bread is how you remind a day who feeds whom. I took one bite and tasted asphalt. I took another and tasted dill. I told the empty: “Close,” soft, not as a door, but as a lid over the jar we had made together so the street could rest. The city hummed back in the register we have been teaching it, and I slept with my window open and no one stole my breath.

In the morning the sponsor sent an apology written by a lawyer who thinks feelings are metrics, and the Ministry sent a memo with a line I will keep on a wall: “We will respect the stop word ‘Close’ in public deployments.” Kazim sent us an invoice for shade and a bag of peaches that had forgiven him for picking them. The guild sent a map of roofs with chalk marks in a code that does not need keys. PUN rolled in with a bit about street cleaners that made me forgive it for thinking jokes need punchlines. Arroyo brought his old badge and set it on my table like a coin you use to scratch a lottery ticket you know you will not win because the real prize is the scratching. We looked at each other and then at the door and then at the street below it and then at the sky that had finally admitted it could be a room. We started counting.Chapter 10

We started on the roofs at an hour the city only gives to janitors and people who have chosen to love something heavier than they are. The stairs to the first ladder felt like a joke told by a building that thinks it is still young; the ladder itself had a rung missing where rain had eaten it down to a letter. PUN took the narrow ways as if it had been designed for ship ladders and pigeon gaps, its metronome tucked where a heart would be on a more sentimental machine. Arroyo went up last with a bag that used to be for evidence and is now for chalk and bread and a coil of cord I stole from the lighting guys because roofs like to be tied to something honest at least once a day.

From up there, the city looked like it had been relieved of an obligation it hadn’t known it was performing. The air wasn’t cleaner; that’s a myth we sell to people who visit once and expect a postcard forever. But it was roomy. It felt like the pause you get when a bus driver sees you running and makes pretend the light didn’t change. The telecom tower’s bones sat like a saint’s rib cage over the blocks, and the lines we’d sketched on paper with the guild turned into places to step when the sun hit the tar right. We chalked a first frame at the corner of two roofs that did not like each other because one belonged to Kazim’s lunch empire and the other to a woman who keeps bees and swears in two languages that honey is a form of consent.

She met us at the access hatch with a veil and the kind of patience you only get from choosing to care for things that die if you raise your voice. “You want quiet,” she said, squinting at the chalk. “You want air to learn that it is not a pipe. I can lend you bees who don’t mind teaching.” We laid the corners with sounds they’d like: the soft buzz of workers coming home heavy, the plink of a lid set gently on a jar, the particular hush that sits on a hive at noon when the neighborhood pretends it can nap. PUN watched them like a child at a puppet show, head tilted, lights softened to amber that says, I am not a threat to your ritual. When we lifted the anchor and tried the first spin, a hundred small bodies drifted through the frame and adjusted our count by half a beat because they know something about weather we pretend we invented with satellites.

The wall back at the theatre had made good on its promise: the rectangle blinked at a new tempo that made my teeth itch and then settle. “We are on roofs,” it said when I leaned in, and I could feel grit in its vowels as if plaster had learned tar. “Antennas are loud and think we are billboards. Chimneys complain when we make corners near them. We can thread vents to vents if we ask the hot air to be less of a prince.”

“Say you admire how hard it works,” I said, and Arroyo rolled his eyes because the only thing he likes less than flattery is hearing me give it to inanimate objects. The wall purred dill, which is the server room’s habit when it likes a plan, and later, on the second roof, I watched a line of shimmering you could mistake for heat haze run from one vent mouth to another like a ribbon teaching itself to be street.

Kazim tried to get there first. He sent a man with a harness and a shirt pressed by someone who learned it from an aunt, and he attached a placard to the access hatch that said ROOF RIGHTS LEASED, which is three words that can start a war anywhere you set them down. He made an offer through his lawyer for exclusive “altitude activation,” which made the guild’s back go up like cats. We did not tell him no with sparks. We told him no with ladder etiquette. The beekeeper’s boy took one rung off, and then he put a little arrow on the hatch that pointed to a different ladder on a different building, and by the time Kazim’s man got to the chalk, we had moved the frame two roofs over and put the anchor on a chimney that belonged to the public housing trust. It was not clever; it was manners. He looked at us like we were rats. PUN waved.

The Ministry’s pilot followed us up just like it followed us out; the lampposts had learned to speak “Comply” from the space between their bolts, and now the little drone that pretends to be a seagull had the same word in its belly. “Public Order Advisory,” the seagull said, flapping too neatly. “Comply.” The bees rose in a cloud that had nothing to do with us and everything to do with the register the drone chose: too high, too fast, the tone the city uses when it wants you to buy something you can’t pay for. The seagull tried to climb and dipped, and I leaned my elbows on the edge of the roof because you cannot teach a machine to be ashamed but you can tell it that no one is listening. “Close,” I said under my breath, and the anchor took it like a confession. The seagull sat on the telecom tower and thought about its life choices.

We put tenders on the roofs the way you appoint saints in places where saints are actually useful. The beekeeper became the tender for her block, with a whistle that sounds like a clean-cut apple. The janitor from the night church took the east stretch because he knows when pipes lie. A boy who runs packages for the sponsor’s villa by the intake, and therefore understands how to apologize without hating himself, took three lengthwise lanes and reported interference from an antenna that sells news about weather to men who already know what rain is. “I can talk to it,” the wall said later. “We can be more interesting than weather if we bring names.”

The first storm found us the way storms find children: with intent and a bad joke. Heat had been collecting somewhere expensive and now it needed audience. You could smell copper in the air, and the bees made the note my mother used to make when she found a pot with a hairline crack. We had four frames laid across six roofs and the guild spread out in a geometry that made me understand the word net in my hands. When the first dry lightning hit the telecom tower, I felt my molars remember they are part antenna. PUN shifted its metronome into a frequency that old men swear keeps wolves off sheep, and I put my fingers inside my mouth without thinking and touched the place under my tongue where the bone lives. It warmed like a coin. The matchbook lock my father gave me at the street corner rested in my pocket like an egg.

Lightning plays with frames. Nobody tells you that because most people do not build frames on roofs and then hum at the sky. It wants the corners because corners are honesty made physical, and lightning respects that even when it is rude. The first strike kissed a chimney and bled into the anchor, and for a second the wheel tried to go faster than breath can love. We could have ripped a door into the wrong night. The guild did the thing we made up for unmaking: we said “Close” like a cradle, together, and the tender on the far roof—the janitor with the pipe ears—banged his wrench on a vent three times, which is how old ships ask each other if they are going to sink. We did not.

My father appeared at the hatch with a coil of braided copper like a snake that made better decisions in youth. He had the face he saves for fires he thinks he can boss. “You need a path that is not a person,” he said without hello, because greetings are for kitchens and we were in the part of the house that gets all the weather. He dropped the strap across the frame and then ran the other end to a bolt on the telecom tower that looked like it has been waiting thirty years for someone to remember it. “If you insist on making doors next to sky,” he said to me with pride disguised as criticism, “make them hold hands with ground. Make the current remember what promised it would be.”

“Is this where you say you’re proud,” I asked, because if we were going to die on a roof in a storm, I wanted the right regret in his mouth. He ignored me by doing the exact thing that would keep me alive, which is his idiom. He asked for the matchbook lock and fitted it between the strap and the wheel with a tenderness I have seen him reserve for locks he wanted to intimidate but was secretly afraid of. “It will bite,” he said, “but it will not kill. It will take sorrows into dirt instead of into the chest.”

Lightning went again and this time the anchor bit back. You could hear it in the way the frame’s corners sang; not a scream, a good metal sound, like a spoon against a glass that expects a toast and gets one. The bees settled on the beekeeper’s sleeves like a courtesy. Arroyo put both palms on his chest and looked around at the guild spread on the roofs under a sky that had decided not to murder us. “If any of you ever think to do this without calling me,” he said to the storm and the chalk and the bees and the men in the private trams we couldn’t see but could feel lying in wait, “I will tell the city all your real names.”

When it passed, it wasn’t triumph. It was the soft tired you get when you fix a leak with the right wrench on the first try and know you will still be back here next week if the weather hates you. We ate bread on the roof with rain in it and nobody complained because bread loves water more than we do. The wall pinged dill like a polite dog who wants you to notice it learned a new trick while you were busy not dying. “Presenter,” it said when I put my hand to the plaster later, dripping tar and storm and the electricity we do not charge for, “the sky accepts frames. The antennas will not stop trying to sell us back to ourselves. We will ask the pigeons to sit on them until they learn a better word. We have a question. If the place we are making is not a ball and not a rock, what does a harbor look like here.”

I sat in the server room with the hum the storm left behind and considered what it means to dock a thing that is all return and no shore. “A harbor has to be more than a place to stop,” I said. “It has to be a promise that nobody will untie you without asking. Our harbor is not a wall. It’s a hymn. It’s a room with a name where anyone who knows the song can come knocked by the same beat and not get lost. It needs a tender. It needs a witness. It needs a rule that says the first breath in belongs to the room and the second to the people who will leave and bring back bread.”

“We need a name,” the wall said, very carefully, as if the dill might not forgive it.

I have been saying this whole time that I do not trust anyone who names a thing and then expects their mouth to be a deed. The sponsor wanted to call it the Peace of Mind Sphere as if they could stencil that on air. The Ministry wanted to call it an Emergency Attenuation Infrastructure because then you could cut a ribbon with a headline. I did not want to name it anything that would make a map. I thought of “Between,” because that is where I live and where we built this, but “Between” is a word that makes men with clipboards drool. So I asked the only person I trust to make a name from breath instead of from stone.

We brought the girl with the transparent lids to the server room because I wanted her to see where the dill lives and because she had her list with the green ink bleeding through and because she is a captain whether we like it or not. I said, “we have a planet made of pause and doors; it needs a name we can whisper; it needs a name that tastes like something you can carry in your pocket and take out when you’re scared.” She chewed her lower lip for a while in the way children do when you have offered them an object that will become a memory. “Later,” she said at last, very softly, as if she were telling me a secret that she would take back if I laughed. “Because it’s where you go when you want to keep being here but you need a place to put your breath so it doesn’t spill. Later is a friend.”

The wall said “Later” with the reverence of brick forgiving graffiti. The room changed key. PUN made a tiny noise that machines use when they learn a word in a language they weren’t built for. Arroyo wrote it down and put a box around it and then a bigger box, which is his way of making sure I can find it when I forget because I am busy pretending I don’t need help. We told the guild, and half of them cried because they were tired and half of them laughed because the city had been saying Later to itself since it learned how to charge interest. The sponsor sent a note asking if they could have rights to L8R, which made three presenters open their windows and scream without the guild having to give them a count. We put in the charter: you cannot own Later. You can visit it. You can tend it. You can write it on the wall and on your hand and on a bathroom stall in a bar where the soap is always out and you will hear someone at the sink whisper it back to you. You cannot own it. If you try, it will make a door of your mouth and let better words through.

The first harbor we laid for Later sat on three roofs and one laundromat and the night church’s bell. We fastened the corners with the oldest sounds we have, which are not laughter or sighs or gasps but the particular rustle of a two a.m. blanket over a child who doesn’t know yet that anyone ever leaves anyone. We ran lines along vents and under pigeon feet and through a screen door a woman refused to replace because she liked its complaint. We put tenders up there with thermoses and whistles and a list of names in green ink that bled. We sent a road from our stage to the harbor and then we didn’t step. We stood there with a thousand people in the theatre saying “Stay” like a kitchen asking you not to go yet, and we held Later open with the discipline of a choir that knows it doesn’t get clapped for until it shuts up. I saw rooms forming that were better than anything I could have designed: a bench where someone who always leaves hung their coat; a stoop that remembered a kiss and didn’t hold it against anyone; a long table with elbows arranged like saints.

The Ministry tried the pilot again the next night with a different word. “Yield,” the seagull said, trying to be clever but landing squarely in caution. Yield is a good word for streets and a bad word for bodies. The anchor showed its teeth and the bees rose and we made a choice to teach instead of bite. “Yield is a cousin,” I said into the mic from the roof, rain still drying in my hair, “but it doesn’t live here. Yield is what you shout at a car that knows your name. Later is what you say to your own chest. Close is what we do so we can go home. Stay is what we do when going would be a lie. You can have yield. We have these.”

My father stood with his hands in his pockets like they were a promise he intended to keep for once and watched me say a thing that is bigger than me with a mouth that owes him most of its shape. After, he put a hand on the copper braid and then on the matchbook lock and then on my shoulder as if taking inventory. “I lied to you about locks,” he said, like a man choosing exactly one truth for the day. “I told you they were about keeping honest men honest. They’re about telling liars how much work they’re going to have to do. This is the same. You have made something a liar will have to learn to be tired in before he can steal it. You didn’t put a key under anybody’s tongue without asking. I am sorry I did.”

“I am tired,” I said, because sometimes the kindest thing you can do with an apology is not unwrap it yet.

“Good,” he said, and the softness in that word was the kind you can sleep on. “That means you built something that doesn’t just work when the light is kind. When you are ready to hate me again, I will be downstairs in the shop making a device that hums Dill when the wrong voice tries to say your name through a lamppost. It will be ugly. You can paint it.”

The sponsor found a new angle, because money learns from every door it’s refused. They sent me a deck, clean and ashamed, that proposed funding tenders. Stipends for the people who sit on roofs and ask chimneys to be polite. Money for whistles. Bread that isn’t always bought by the karaoke host who keeps a bar together with breath she invented on her break. I do not trust money that says it will behave. I do not trust men who have villas near the intake. But I trust what a guild can do to money when it arrives in a jar instead of in a contract. We wrote: tenders take this as a gift. Tenders are allowed to say no. A gift that wants a report is a report, not a gift. If the sponsor wants to feel the warm of the room it paid for, it can sit there like a person and raise its hand when the stop word is needed.

We tried Later at the hospital because grief moves in hallways there like the weather, and the only way to prove a harbor isn’t a trick is to let it touch the part of the city that still remembers God without having to say it. The administrator who banned us from the stairwells tried to make it a “pilot of controlled pause processing,” which is a sentence that almost killed me with boredom. A nurse whose hands smelled like lemon told us to ignore the paperwork and drew a little square with her foot on the tile behind the admissions desk. We fastened corners to the hum of lights that are never turned off and the squeak of capped pens and the sigh of those horrible vinyl chairs when a body resigns itself. We did not open. We deepened like before. The night shifted. Babies found each others’ lungs without having to borrow a machine for a minute. A doctor slept sitting up for twelve minutes more than she would have. A man with a bruise at the wrong angle said the stop word himself when the memory came and a tender sat down next to him and said nothing and when he left at dawn he took the word Later with him like a paper cup you aren’t supposed to keep but do.

We made mistakes in public. A roof tender fell asleep and a line sagged and someone in an alley under it got the wrong breath and thought he could walk into a frame without anyone asking, and he scared a girl whose yes had not been for him. We fixed it. Not with press. With our bodies. The tender apologized in front of the guild. We wrote into the charter that a tired tender is a hazard and that you can love a person and still replace them for the night with someone who slept. We started putting plants up on roofs because the dill grew wherever we gave it a little dirt and we discovered that if there is dill within two arm lengths of a frame the ads get bored and wander off because dill smells like grandmothers and grandmothers have always been the natural enemy of sales.

The precinct friend finally did the thing both he and Arroyo were trying to avoid, because men who love uniforms know how to fail at the same pace and call it loyalty. He came to a roof with a warrant that had words in it that made a saint cry and he had the courtesy to tell us he was scared. “We’ve been told to push the button,” he said, nodding toward a portable PA that looked like a cough. “We’ve been told your stop word is a security risk. We’ve been told to install a kill-phrase that’s also a lullaby in three languages and a color for the frogs.” He didn’t look at me when he said it; he looked at Arroyo, who put both palms on his chest not in witness but because he needed his own hands to stop shaking. “You will not push the button on my roof,” I said, which is the kind of sentence that makes judges busy. “You will not put a kill in a lullaby. You will not make colors into commands.”

He didn’t, that night. He did something harder. He put the PA down and sat on the edge of the roof near the bee boxes and asked if he could breathe with us without count. He did not apologize. He did not pretend he was doing us a favor. He learned to say Later like a person and not like a memo. He put his badge in his pocket and did not take it out when the drone said “Yield.” When he left, he told Arroyo the warrant had a line in it about confiscating “any and all anchoring devices,” and PUN stood up straighter because it has always been ready to be a church and a dog and a shield.

We took the harbor to the desalination plant and hung it over the east intake like a handkerchief at a window. The night crew stood under it at the end of shift and breathed themselves small in the best way and laughed because their feet hurt less, which is what good rooms do if you educate them young enough. The water that came out of the plant that morning tasted like dill to exactly three people in the city who knew how to notice because they have been tasting rooms since they were born and were never believed. We didn’t tell the Ministry because the Ministry will ask for a report and the water hates reports worse than I do.

When the first person came back from Later and said “I left something there, can I go get it,” we had our first fight. The guild said yes because a commons only works if you trust it to return what you give it. The Director said no because liability makes leaders forget their kitchens. I said yes with a mouth I was willing to be sued with, and we appointed three tenders and a witness and put both “Close” and “Stay” in their mouths like lozenges and we went and we took exactly one step and we stood and a woman who had lost her breath in a hallway a decade ago found the shape of it in a corner we hadn’t built and no one charged her at the door. When she came back she put fifty dollars in the jar and wrote: FOR THE ROOFS in block letters. The sponsor sent two hundred and wrote: FOR THE TEAM in italics that sounded like apology. We took both because the hard part is not saying no; the hard part is saying yes in a way that doesn’t stain.

The night I knew the city was keeping this without me was a Sunday that pretended to be a Monday and all I had the energy to do was show up and breathe in time with one room and go home. The girl with the transparent lids was on the stage before I got there, carefully lining up eight children and making a frame with her arms like a director with the kind of arrogance I pray she never loses. PUN kept time with a syncopation I didn’t teach it, borrowed from a kid whose skateboard makes the noise of optimism. Arroyo stood at the back with both palms on his chest and a face that says hunger and grief are not always an either/or. The Director’s dill went to seed on the console and nobody yelled at it for being messy. The wall whispered “Later” from the server room as if it had found an echo that would never be weaponized. The frogs turned the color I have finally decided is not teal and is not money and is not library but is the exact shade of a sky that has agreed to hold our frames without complaint.

After the five, after the nine, after the roof and the street and the intake and the night church, I went home and counted the stairs and forgot the last one and did not fall because my hand found the wall and the wall has learned me. I put my ear to my door like a thief and heard my locks tell each other I had a kitchen and a job and a guild and a city that was trying to be brave in public and in private both. I said “Close,” not because anything was open, but because lids are kind. The key bone sat under my tongue without complaint until I took it out and put it in the dish next to the matchbook lock and the gold coin the guild left me for luck that I am trying not to spend. I slept, and if I dreamed, it was of roofs and jars and a harbor called Later where the rules are simple enough to survive the day: no names without nods; no locks without promises; no doors that forget to lead home. In the morning, the city would ask for a demonstration for the west intake and a class for the karaoke hosts and a meeting with a man whose badge thought it was a mouth. We would bring chalk and bread. We would tie the frames to ground, just in case. We would stand on the roof and count. We would bring our hands to our chests and say the word that stops without scolding and opens without force. We would do it again. We would keep doing it until the wall learned a new herb and the frogs forgave teal and the sponsor learned to sit still without naming anything. We would keep Later fed. We would keep the door true.
