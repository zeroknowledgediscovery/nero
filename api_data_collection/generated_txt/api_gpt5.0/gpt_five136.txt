The morning the courier dropped the blue plastic tub at the garage door, the rain in Leeds came sideways, sharp and grainy, a kind of weather that wedged under collars and made swearing under your breath seem pointless. Kath wiped her hands on a rag that only made her fingers oilier, nudged the tub with the toe of her boot and turned back to the Ford Focus with its guts open and its engine tilted like a scolded dog.

“Leave it,” said Daz from under the next car, a Vauxhall Astra that had been making a tapping noise for a week. “It’ll be parts. Marion’ll sign for it.”

“Marion’s in the back doing sums,” Kath said. The Focus coughed, a little flare of spark and a clink she liked. “Anyway, it’s addressed to B&S Auto, no one in particular.” She nudged the tub again and the lid rattled and popped off on one corner like the box was sighing. Inside, nested in shredded brown paper, were dozens of tiny silver bolts, a fan belt coiled like a snake in a winter garden, two cabin filters in cardboard sleeves with German on them, and a thing wrapped in tissue paper, no bigger than her hand.

She lifted it out because when you tell your brain to ignore the thing you don’t understand, your hands get rebellious. The tissue paper stuck a little, like it had been taped with spit, and then whatever was inside fell into her palm. A figure—no, a toy, a figure—stared up at her with painted eyes, a man in a navy jacket with a thin tie, a clipboard, neatly molded hair, little ridges for the comb lines.

“Well that’s daft,” Daz said, metal ringing as he shimmed out on his creeper. “We order spark plugs and get Mr. Ken-in-a-clip-on. What you gonna do, tell him to teach the belt how to behave?” He laughed and coughed into a rag. “Anything else? A wee dog? A whistle?”

“It’s a mistake,” Kath said, though she held the figure carefully and felt the ridged plastic under the paint. “They’ve packed a toy in with the filters. For somebody’s kid.” The man was smiling with a kind of severe cheerfulness, like the people in the posters from the fifties, the ones telling you that hard work was something like a mattress: if you lay on it right you’d sleep well. He had little hinges at his shoulders. A little slot in his back like something could click in. The name on the minuscule name tag, if she squinted: P. Voss, tutor. She laughed then and didn’t know why. “Look at that. Tutor. He’s a teacher.”

“Lucky he’s small. Put him on the dashboard to supervise.” Daz shoved himself back under the Astra and whistled something that sounded like the theme to a show nobody watched since 1996. “Marion’ll want to send an email. Don’t nick it.”

“I don’t nick things,” Kath said, but she slipped the tissue paper and the toy into her pocket all the same, the rain coming in sideways and making her hair stick to her neck, and set the blue tub in the office out of harm’s way.

In the afternoon a man came in who said could you look at my brake pads, they’ve been squealing like a piglet and I’ve got a long drive to Poole tonight, and Kath said we can take a look, and Daz said I can squeeze you in but it’ll cost more than a fiver. People came and went. The heaters rattled. The Focus left with a relieved sound she loved and the Astra was less tappish when it bumped away. Around six it went quieter and she could hear the rain bouncing off the corrugated roof, tinny drum beats.

It took until after they’d shut and Marion had counted the till, tapping the coins into piles the way someone taps a rhythm on a table, for Kath to take another look. She had the toy on the workbench, sat him up against the side of the vice, watched as his little painted eye looked past her, unfocused because of the way these things are painted; his hands were molded in the shape of generic readiness.

“You’ve got a name, then,” she said. She didn’t say it like someone talking to a doll, but like someone checking a chassis number, a part code. “P. Voss. That’s precise. Are you meant to help me pass my evening classes? That was the plan, right, Teach?” She tried to make a joke of it, but there was a crinkle of something in her throat that wasn’t laughter.

There were the evening classes, yes. She’d signed up because Marion said if you want to move up, you should get that certification. Diagnostics. New computers coming in all the time. Old ones as well. The course would be Wednesday nights, two hours, over in Headingley in a college classroom that smelled of dust and Durham cologne. She’d picked up the paper about it and put it down and picked it up again for six months. Her mum would have said, love, what do you want with school, you’ve got more sense in your hands than those men have in their heads, and her dad would have said, do it, learn. He taught her the first time how to change an oil filter with a jar strap because there wasn’t the right wrench about, and he’d said it like a story. Now he was in Derby with a second wife and little tiny dog. Mum was in Portugal selling ceramic tiles and sending text messages with flowers in them. Neither of them had a clue about the black shape sometimes sitting in Kath’s chest at three in the morning, identical to the silhouette of a missing tool.

She took Voss home because she didn’t like leaving things that looked like they were waiting. Also because someone would nick it in the morning, not her, obviously, but someone. In her flat above the chemist, with the nice old woman downstairs who smelled like Parma Violets and never remembered her name properly, she set Voss on the mantelpiece next to the plant she couldn’t keep alive (succulent, unkillable, said the man in the shop, but she was trying to prove him wrong). The rain had turned into the kind of drizzle that Leeds settled into like a scarf, the view from her little living room window a seam of pavement and the yellow line at the kerb, a slice of road that trucks used like it was theirs.

When Kath lay on her secondhand sofa and watched bad telly with the volume low, Voss sat in profile and looked across the room with his smile and his tie. At some point, because the world is daft, because something tiny can tip the weight, she felt watched in a not-bad way. It might have been the way the lamp made a little shadow under the carved line of his hair. It might have been that her eyes were tired.

She slept badly, dreamed about her dad again, how he wore his training jacket with the zip always stuck halfway and the way his forearms were a book of little scars that read like a novel you could only understand if you’d held a wrench yourself. In the dream he told her to hold the torch while he looked for something he’d dropped into the engine, and she held it and held it and her arm ached and he kept saying, steady, steady now, you’re being daft, you’re waving it about like you’re at a concert, and she wanted to put the torch down and look at him properly, but she couldn’t because he kept saying the words and the drop-lamp made a circle of light that slid and slid on the metal like a slow fish. When she woke it was still dark and the plant in the corner had given up another leaf.

On Wednesday she went to the college with her hair scraped up and a clean hoodie because Marion had said don’t turn up looking like you fell under a car on your way, even if you did, and a pencil case with pens she’d stolen from around the garage when no one was looking. The corridor smelled of the rag the cleaner used, lemon and faint bleach. There were posters for mindfulness and for a play the drama kids were doing, where everybody wore masks and said the same line in different ways. She found the room. She found a seat near the door because she was suspicious of rooms like some people were suspicious of dogs. People drifted in like they were made of the same material but different sizes: a big lad with a coat with fur on it. A woman older than Kath in a neat wool coat, hair the precise colour of a radiator. A lad with a buzzcut who looked like he could break into a song if pushed. A woman her own age with rings on every finger and a voice like a ball bearing on ceramic.

The lecturer—or the tutor, that word the toy carried—was late. The class buzzed. Kath watched a clock that had a second hand that did that thing of not moving and then moving like a jump rope. At five past, at six past, the door opened and a man walked in who looked like he’d been printed onto the world with his lines already chosen.

He had dark hair and the crisp kind of jaw men get in adverts for razors and a white shirt with a tie exactly the colour of the sky when there’s snow you didn’t ask for. He set his papers on the desk. He turned a pen between finger and thumb, quick, exact, as if somebody had practiced the motion for him a hundred times.

“Good evening,” he said in a voice turned up two notches above normal. “I’m Peter Voss. You can call me Pete or Peter, don’t call me Sir, I haven’t done anything to deserve that. I’ll be teaching Advanced Diagnostics 1, and if you’re in the wrong room, please don’t tell me until the end of the session. I like to live a little.”

The class did the little laugh you do for a teacher at the right stand-up show, the one that says yes, okay, we’ll go with this. Kath felt a line of recognition run up her spine: the name. The tie. The syllables of it. The little toy at home with its smile. It was silly; she felt silly, she felt something else as well.

He wrote his name on the board in block capitals. PETER VOSS. He wrote the word DIAGNOSTICS beneath and drew an arrow that slowly leaned left like an indecisive tree.

“Now,” he said, and clapped once softly, “some of you will be working mechanics. Some of you will be… not. I’m not here to make you feel daft. I’m here to make the curious bits less mysterious. A car is a story, you know? It tells you exactly what’s wrong if you know how to listen, and it lies to you if it wants attention.”

Kath twitched because it sounded like something she’d said to her dad when she was twelve and the Fiesta said it needed something it didn’t need. The weird thought, too: the toy at home, P. Voss on its tiny badge, and this man, this actual man, who had a real shadow that fell on the floor when he moved. They weren’t the same; the toy had a smile like the idea of a smile. The man’s mouth did a complicated thing at the corners.

The class went in, and he knew how to hold a room. He did that teacher thing of throwing questions like keys into the space and waiting while they spun. He said who here has ever listened with a screwdriver, who here loves a multimeter like a cat, who here has sworn at a car because you changed a thing because it was easier than thinking. The boy with the buzzcut put a hand up for all of that and grinned. The woman with the radiator hair shook her head. The rings-on-every-finger woman tapped her nail against the desk and said, “What if the car’s just cursed, yeah?”

“Then you sell it to someone who wronged you,” Voss said without missing a beat. His smile was good at pretending it had teeth, but it didn’t, not really. He had a way of standing with his feet in a V like dancers do, like he believed in certain poses. He clicked a slide onto the screen and an exploded diagram of a Bosch sensor lit the wall and made everyone look clever.

Kath took notes and because she had pride and because she was better with hand than head she also drew little pictures of what he meant. She thought, I could fall in love with a voice, I could fall in love with the way someone says the word torque as though it’s the name of a town they were born in. She thought, daft. She thought, shut up. Every time he looked at the side of the room where she sat, she felt herself become a thing with a location, pinned like an address. She fiddled with her pencil. Once, he tilted his head as if he’d heard her thinking.

At the break, where people lower their shoulders and figure out whether to approach or stay, she stayed at her desk and looked at the diagram and then she might have looked at him and then looked away, like the rules for not looking into a welding arc. But he was right there.

“You’re a working mechanic, aren’t you?” he said in that not-quite-loud voice, like he’d dialed it to be audible from any distance.

“How can you tell?” she said, smiling because that was the bit she knew how to do.

“The hands,” he said, and then, because he probably said it to all the ones like her, “and the eyes. There’s a way people who listen to machines look at drawings. Where do you work?”

“Benton & Son. Cross Gates. The son left in 2009,” she said, and then because she didn’t know why, she added, “I’m Kath.”

“Kath,” he said, checking he’d heard it right. “I like Bentons. I took a course there once.” He was a strange mix of formal and easy, like a suit you could sleep in. He leaned on the desk and the sleeves of his shirt didn’t crease. “You’ll be bored by this bit.”

“I’m not,” she said, and blushed like she was thirteen, cross with herself for it. “I mean, there’s bits I’ve done with my hands, but I never got the theory, not properly. I like what you said about stories. About things lying. They do. Sometimes they pretend to have a different fault because they’re embarrassed about the real one.”

He tilted his head again. When the light hit his face there was a sheen on his skin like he’d never learned to sweat. “Embarrassed,” he said. “I might use that.”

“Go on,” she said. “Use my line.” She didn’t often speak much to men like him. She had rules about not giving away too much, rules she broke, but she carried them around like a second set of wrenches. He made her feel like maybe she could.

“Have you ever thought about teaching?” he said, already walking away a little as if the answer didn’t matter very much. “You’d be good at it. People who come from the hands, as you say, have a way with words they don’t know about.”

She didn’t say no. She carried the question around like the little toy she had kept in her pocket the day before, its weight, silly, perfectly unimportant, changing how her body moved.

He had a trick of recalling names without seeming to; later, during a practical demonstration on a bench with a harness and a set of sensors that looked like a cluster of black fitted mushrooms, he called out, “Kath, come and tell these fine people what you’d check first—no, don’t look at me like I’ve asked you to sing. Anyone would think you didn’t do this while it rained on your head.”

And she laughed, and the class laughed, and she took the harness, careful with it like it was an animal, and said, patient and more patient, looking, listening, what comes before what, and the older woman with radiator hair smiled, and the buzzcut boy crossed his arms like he was learning something about learning. The woman with all the rings cut an apple with a knife she pulled from somewhere and watched with interested eyes that hid the thing behind the thing.

After the class, he gave out sheets with diagrams and the dates of the course and a neat list of resources in a font that made you feel like you were already doing better. “Please email me if…” he said, and the rest of the sentence was ordinary, but the shape of it landed. She looked at the email on the bottom of the page. voss.p@academy. She folded the sheet and put it in the front of her notebook with a care she didn’t give to many pieces of paper.

Outside, the rain was merely opinionated, not aggressive. She pulled her hood up and he walked the same way for a bit, his shoes not getting wet somehow, his tie neat. She thought about saying something else. She thought about the toy sitting on her mantel. She said, “Is there a Mrs. Voss?” and then was immediately mortified the way you can be when your mouth is two seconds ahead of your sense.

He smiled a smile that had no edges. “No,” he said. Then, the fraction after, “I don’t… that isn’t… Not really.” He looked up at the black and said, “Bad night for cars, good night for studying,” and somehow he wasn’t even walking next to her anymore. He had a knack for being in the right in-between distance. She watched him go toward the bus stop. He turned once, like he was checking a mirror. He raised his hand as if to wave and then adjusted his cuff instead.

She took the long way home. She walked past the Thai place where she’d taken Dan once, a boy who had said he liked her hands and then had faded out of her life like the sound of the formers at the steelworks had in the stories her grandad told. She passed a charity shop that had a Rowing Club blazer in the window, someone’s old life starched, someone’s days on a river ironed into a shape. She thought of the little toy.

When she got in she stood in the doorway and looked at the mantelpiece, as if she’d catch the figure at something. It sat exactly as she’d left it, knees locked, clipboard at the ready. “You know your own name,” she told it. “That’s already more than some men.” She laughed at herself, a sound that went around the room and came back to her with a tinny edge. She lifted the figure and set it down on the table in front of her and ate a bowl of leftover stew while it sat there, an odd dinner guest. She tried to listen for how daft she was, but it kept slipping between stations: either she was completely daft and this was fine, or she was not daft and the world was, and that was also fine.

She said it like a test. “Peter,” she said. “Peter Voss.” She put him on the edge of the table and tapped his little shoes, his little molded soles, on the wood. They made a sound like the click of a pen being ready.

Work was different when you had something else in your pocket. She found herself telling Daz odd bits of theory he didn’t ask her for, which he accepted as the price of being a co-worker with someone who had found a new thing. Garland in the office set up an online booking system and spent all day swearing at it and saying it wasn’t intuitive. Marion wrote an email and sent it to the supplier about the extra toy in the blue tub and the supplier wrote back “This is impossible” and “There is no such inventory” and “Perhaps your person on the premises added a personal belongs.” Marion asked the room who was the person who had added a personal belongs and everyone ignored her because of all the things to lie about, that one was small and fun.

He was in her head. He had managed it with an elbow, barely. That was the thing: he barely leaned into it and she felt herself tip. She told herself it was because she liked the way his mind worked and the way he made the room breathe. She told herself not to do that thing she did, which was to become very good at liking someone and then having to unlearn it, like teaching your muscles to reach for a tool that no longer lived there.

At the next class he wore the same tie. The exact same one? Could be. Men had more than one tie that looked the same. He clicked his marker, he made a joke about how diagnostics is basically learning to read because the car writes to you in a four-letter alphabet, C, O, D, E. Someone groaned. He loved the groan. “We’re going to talk about known good states,” he said, which made Kath smile because it sounded like he was making a church. He made them listen to the sound of a misfire on a recording and then play a game where you closed your eyes and pointed to where in the engine bay the fault was. People were a bit shy at first and then the shyness gave way to something like play.

He brought in a harness again and a stack of connectors and set up a half-saucer of tea on the desk and never drank it. He never, Kath noticed, ate anything when others did. In the break he stood and watched the window and the rain in its three speeds, like someone had three settings for it in their head and nothing between. He asked her, “What do you do when you can’t find it?” and she said, “Try something else,” and he said, “No, I mean, the other thing,” and she knew he meant the nights when nothing is anything you can name.

“I look at photos of the sea,” she said. “Not going anywhere. I look up at the ceiling. I go for a drive and I don’t tell anyone where, and me and the car just sort it out. It isn’t very clever.”

“It is, actually,” he said, and moved his hand as if he was moving a thing like a chess piece. “Do you let someone else drive sometimes?”

“I don’t like being a passenger,” she said, and when she said it she felt the echo of the words in bigger places. He smiled as if he believed her and didn’t either.

When he leaned over the bench, his elbow against the wood, the cuff of his shirt was very clean. Kath liked people who were either dirty and real or very clean and not. He had a scent like new book. He never took his jacket off although the room sometimes ran hot and the radiators clanked and coughed like a polite ghost. When he turned at the board and drew the kind of angle he’d meant to draw, exactly, she had a thought she didn’t like very much: that perhaps he was not made of the same material as the rest of them. It wasn’t a bad thought. It was like when a new car came in and everything on it was made of soft plastic and you thought, nobody made this for a human hand. They’d made it for a robot to click together on a line.

She took him home mentally that night, and physically took the little figure out of her bag and lined it up next to a row of screws she had put there for no reason except that her kitchen was also a bench sometimes. She held the toy in her palm. The slot in the back had a little lip, as if some accessory once fit there: a backpack? A little black pack? She googled, because that’s what you do when you want honesty with no guilt. PETER VOSS ACTION FIGURE gave her nothing. VOSS TUTOR toy, nothing. P. VOSS plastic. Nothing but a German toothpaste. She laughed. She put the little man on the edge of the mantelpiece and turned him a fraction. The plant had given up. She binned it, said sorry out loud to a thing that wasn’t listening.

On the third week he brought in a guest, a woman wearing a cardigan the colour of a bruise and a skirt like a promise, who talked about customer reports and how to listen when someone says a car is making a “worrying” noise as if the word worrying is a spec. He moved around as she spoke, adjusting the lights, turning things, making sure the slide advanced when it should. Kath watched him the way you watch someone check the oil: he wasn’t showy, he did the motions, he was precise. When someone asked the guest a question about warranties he answered it instead, without looking. When the guest laughed, he smiled the absent smile of a person waiting for their turn to speak.

At the end of the class the woman with the rings said to him, “We’re going for a pint, come for a pint,” and he said, “I don’t drink,” in the kind of voice a person says I don’t fly helicopters, and she said, “Fine, have a lemonade, don’t be boring,” in a way that would have made Kath put her defences up if it had been directed at her. He laughed as if he had been wound to do so and said yes.

Kath went because she had decided she would let herself have this, this wanting, in the shape that it wanted to be, which might be a pint and a talk and a laugh and nothing else. The pub’s carpet smelled like an old dog but in a comforting way. People were being loud without being angry. He sat on the edge of the bench and the lemon slice in his lemonade looked too bright next to him. He told the story about his first car, which was exactly unremarkable in the way that made her believe him: a grey Civic with a radio that always sang in a second key, paid for with a summer of work in a warehouse where he broke his thumb and learned what boredom really was.

“What did you do before teaching?” the big lad asked him, leaning back with his beer in his paw in a way that suggested he had always been leaning and always would.

“I travelled,” Voss said, and part of Kath that had known men like this said of course you did, of course. But he didn’t say Bali or Thailand, which is what they always say; he said, “Not far. A lot of buses. A lot of waiting rooms. A lot of reading the right thing and sometimes the wrong thing.”

“Where were you born?” the rings woman said, and the question hung there like a coat on a hook in a hallway. He looked down at his lemon slice and then up with that same smile. “Here,” he said. “Not here-here. But: here.” He pointed at the ground. The way he moved his finger made Kath think of the little slot in the back of the toy.

He asked Kath in a quieter voice, later, when the noise in the pub had gone fuzzy and the heaters had turned on, “Why cars?”

“Why not?” she said, and then, annoyed with the answer, corrected, “Because I liked it. Because I liked being good at something, and cars told me when I’d done it right. They start. They go. They go better than they did. People don’t. I don’t always, either.”

“Do you need to be good at everything?” he said with a softness that was probably practice and she still took it because that’s how practice works.

“No,” she said.

“You look like you don’t believe you when you say no.”

“I’m working on it.”

“Nobody works on it. They say they will and then they don’t.”

“Not true,” she said, and because she felt reckless and daft and it felt like taking a corner too fast in a car that knows you, she put her hand on the table near his and then nearer. His hand did not move. There was a strange distance between the surface of the wood and the skin of his knuckles, a shine. For a fraction of a breath she thought there would be contact. Then he withdrew as if a slight magnet had been turned on.

“Don’t do that,” he said, not unkind, not kind. It was the voice of the sign that says do not touch glass, exhibit feels pain.

“I’m sorry,” she said, and laughed a little to cover it and wished she hadn’t.

“It’s not you,” he said, and then, again, like a line someone had taught him, “It really isn’t, you’re very—this is very nice. I’m a bit odd.”

“That’s fine,” she said. “Everyone’s odd.”

He finished his lemonade. He didn’t suck the lemon wedge like some people did. He stood and the woman with the rings said something Kath didn’t hear. He said he had to catch a bus. He left with his cuffs tidy. Kath watched the door swing and settle. She thought if she went home now he would be a story she had to tell herself to make living feel like it made sense.

She went home. The little figure on her mantel was not where she’d left it. It was at the other end, the opposite edge, as if a draft had pushed it. But there are no drafts like that. The window was shut. The old woman downstairs had not broken into her flat and adjusted her toys. Kath laughed because the only options were that she had moved it and forgot, or that it had moved, and one of those made her sound like someone who collected porcelain cats and believed in ghosts and one made her sound like someone who was too busy to remember. She choose busy, not ghosts. She put it back where it had been. She breathed out. She went to bed and lay on her side and listened to the hum of the night, all the tiny machines, the clock, the fridge, the streetlight. Leeds breathed back.

Two weeks later, after the class where they did nothing but read fault codes and argue about whether the cable was to blame or the port or the user, she stayed behind and asked if he would take a look at her notes and tell her whether she was thinking right. He said yes like he would always say yes because the yes was part of the job, but when he sat next to her and looked at her drawings—her lines were accurate but had a bit of flourish, she couldn’t help it—he made a small sound that could have been appreciation, could have been a cough.

“You’re good with negatives,” he said. “You think in else-ifs.”

“That’s a computer thing,” she said.

“It’s also a people thing,” he said, and put one finger on the page without touching the heavy pen mark. He held his finger there. It was very still. She had the strongest desire to put her finger on top of his. She didn’t.

His head turned slightly, like a bird might, and he said her name without looking away from the page. “Kath.”

She swallowed. “Yes.” The L in her name was a phantom; she’d never had one. She liked that. People misheard and added one in. He never had.

“Do you know that you are—” he said, and stopped, and when he started again he had bent the sentence into a different shape. “You should go for your Level 3 sooner. You can skip some. You’ll get bored.”

“I don’t get bored,” she said, and wanted to say I’m never bored when you are in the room, which would have been a full tilt out of a space she’d been trying to keep safe.

He inclinded his head. “Me neither,” he said. “Me never.”

She smiled, because he sometimes clipped words the wrong way around, and she hadn’t clocked it before. Me never. The small thing. She stored the small things the way some people kept receipts.

It felt like a slow accretion. Like rust, but not the bad kind. Like the kind that softens a thing and makes it look like it has a story. The words they used, the way he said her name, the way he didn’t say other things. He looked at the world square on. He held himself like someone had once put him in a box with the molded parts of a different life and he had waited until the lid gave.

She wrote him an email. She didn’t need to. She could have asked in class. But the email let her compose the thing, tune it, turn the bolt till it was flush. She wrote:

Hi Peter,

I had a question about the waveform with the misfire at three seconds. Was that crank or cam, or was it both? I think I get it but I don’t want to get the wrong thing in my head and forget to clear it out.

Also—thanks for the other night. It was good to feel like I don’t have to pretend to know what I don’t.

K

She stared at the K as if that letter would betray her. She hit send. She put her phone face down. The old woman downstairs coughed twice in the rhythm of an old song. The fridge clicked on. She waited for a breeze that isn’t wind, the one that passes through bodies when they hope.

He wrote back nine minutes later. Sometimes the speed, sometimes the precise nine minutes, sometimes the yo-yo of hope and answer was as intoxicating as the content. He wrote:

Kath,

You had it. Cam. The dip at three is the right shape for that behavior.

It was good. You don’t pretend. It’s rare.

If you want to come by early next week, I can show you the new demo harness. It’s fancier than it needs to be. I like that.

P

She read it three times and the words shifted not at all. She put her phone down and then picked it up again as if someone had changed the ending while she blinked. Come by early. The fussy part of her brain wrote it down in her mind calendar. The other part imagined standing at the door of the classroom before anyone else, imagined the emptiness of the corridors, imagined the way the light would feel on the dry whiteboard, imagined his sleeves turned back for once, imagined how she would take the harness and say something simple and he would laugh. She slept with the picture up on a shelf behind her eyes.

When she went early he was already there. He was always already there. Sometimes it felt like he could be folded away into a cupboard when they left and set back on the desk when they came. He had the harness laid out like a dinner table, everything aligned, everything at right angles. He looked up and said, “That was quick. Good,” and set a chair out for her and when she sat her knee brushed the edge of the table and the harness moved the right amount like a cat that liked you.

He showed her the pins and the grounds like he was showing her a map of a country he’d moved to. He explained the new part with an exactness that didn’t feel like showing off. Kath leaned in. The light in here was the odd colour of winter, and it put a sheen on his skin that she would later think about too much. He did not smell like people who worked for a living smelled. He smelled like paper, like new car interior when it hasn’t met any human hands yet.

“Kath,” he said again, mid-sentence, as if her name was part of the diagram.

“Hm,” she said, head down, drawing the curve of a waveform with a pencil she’d pinched from the office, the one with the garage name on the side.

“Do you know those little figures… People used to have them, on the dashboards, of saints? Or hula girls?” He put his finger at the point of his thought and left it there. “You’re going to laugh.”

“I’m not,” she said, and then laughed ready, because you can’t order your body about that much.

“I had one,” he said, and then corrected, “I have one. I don’t know where it is. But something tells me it’s nearby.” He said it like he was telling her about a book he’d read, and she felt a dart of panic at the base of her skull. The little toy on her mantelpiece sat for a second on the desk between them like a ghost of itself. Her heart did the thing with the three fast thumps and then the quiet. She had a lot of practice at keeping face. She nodded as if he’d mentioned that he had a plant that he overwatered.

“Mine was a saint,” she said. “My mum had one. Saint someone. He lost an arm and everyone said it was bad luck and she said he didn’t need two arms to be a saint. I like that kind of maths.”

He smiled. It was the smile you give a story that lives somewhere else. “Yes,” he said. “I like it too.”

He picked up a connector and turned it and clicked it back and forth. The way he rotated it was incredibly pleasing. He set it down in a line again because he couldn’t help the lines. He leaned back against the corner of the desk, nothing moved under him, nothing made a dent. In some people the world gave a little to their weight; with him the world arranged itself the other way around.

She left before the others came in. She didn’t want to have a different face on when they arrived. She wanted to keep the one she had made with him alone. She went to the bathroom and ran water over her hands as if she could wash off the feeling. In the mirror she saw herself the way she didn’t want to see herself, a girl who had made herself into a woman you could not push around easily, with strong wrists and a mouth that had learned it could be soft. She thought of sending a picture to her mum. She thought of not.

After that day the little figure didn’t stay where she left it. It shifted small distances. The head was angled a fraction differently. The clipboard had a smudge where there had been no smudge. The fingers were not as fixed as you’d think. The slot on the back felt warmer. She put it in a drawer and left it there to punish herself or to punish it and in the morning it was on top of the dresser again, pointed toward the door. She said okay, okay, out loud and no one answered.

She went to class and he explained wiring diagrams like they were routes between houses that you cared about. He made a joke about the French and their approach to relays. He asked her one day would she hang back after to help him carry something to the store cupboard and she said yes and he gave her a box lighter than it looked and they walked down the long corridor that smelled of lemons and some other smell underneath it that might have been old spilled soup. In the cupboard he set the box down and the light clicked and clicked and then stayed on. He looked at her and she looked at him and for a second the space between them had a shape. Then he went past her with his body arranged so that it didn’t brush hers, not because he didn’t want to but because touching would have been against a rule he didn’t name.

“Do you know what I like about this?” he said, no context, the way a person on a radio says something just as you’re passing a bridge.

“What?” she said, waiting.

“That you’re here,” he said, and it was nothing, it was everything, it was a pin that held a map, it was a thing easily said, it was a thing that meant that for an hour afterwards she felt like she was the right weight poured into her shoes.

She stood in her little kitchen that night, the little figure on the edge of the table like a person at a bus stop, and she told herself, this is a thing that is happening. You could leave it at that. You could say it like a prayer if you were that kind of person. You could also touch the back of the figure and feel the little slot and think, what goes there. You could not google because the nothing was better than the wrong something.

Snow came to Leeds three times that year, each time like it had been sent by an administrative error. It fell suddenly and not enough. The first time the roads were a slick of apology and the garage saw no one all morning and then eleven men arrived at once with their eyebrows busy. The second time it fell at night and Kath stood by the window and watched it hit the streetlight’s cone and she wanted to catch every flake. The third time it came at the end of a class and he said, “Let’s finish early,” and they all laughed because he’d gone two minutes over and called it early. Someone made a joke about sledging and he made a joke back. He put his hand on the door as he always did before opening it, as if he were testing the wood, the hinge, the air. He faced the White. He breathed. He turned to the class and said, “Be careful out there.”

Kath said, “Walk with me,” just loud enough to be a nonsense if he pretended he’d misheard. He didn’t pretend. He nodded. They walked in the slush. It made a sound like crushed paper. He had a hat with no bobble that made his head look more deliberate. He said, “I’m not supposed to,” and she said, “What,” and he said, “I don’t know,” and she laughed, a breath, in the air that made her throat sound like old metal.

At the corner he stopped. He turned to her. The streetlight put a circle under his boots and did nothing to touch the top of his hair. She wanted to put her hand against his cheek and feel the temperature. He said, “I would like to—” and then he said, “No,” and then he said, “Do you know how old I am?” and then he said, “That’s not the right question,” and she said, “Do you want a cup of tea,” and he laughed because tea was the right kind of question, and he said, “I can’t,” and she said, “Because?” and he said, “I don’t know,” and then he leaned forward and she felt the heat of the yes that a person keeps in their mouth and then the air filled that space again because some force, not a joke, not a friend, a force, had pushed them both back a fraction.

“Okay,” she said, and she meant it, and she hated saying it, and she would say it again, and again, because she could be patient when the thing had a shape in time.

“You’re good,” he said, and it sounded like he meant at cars, at this, at waiting.

“I know,” she said, and because something in her was tired of this, the bending of it, the path that curved and curved and did not quite meet, she reached out and touched his sleeve. It was smoother than cloth should be.

He flinched without moving. “Don’t,” he said, but the word was soft. In the light his face had no pores. It had highlight, shadow, like something rendered then printed. She swallowed. She wanted to go home and take the toy and throw it hard. She wanted to laugh at herself. She wanted a cup of tea, two sugars, to put her hands on the cup and say, there, there, quietly to the absence of anyone.

The next day she looked up old staff photos of the department because she had turned into a person she didn’t like. He was there in one from years ago, this same exact him, his hair neat, his tie right. She scrolled and scrolled. He was there in another and another. The older ones were lower quality, pixelated, but you could see him. 2012. 2011. Her stomach pulled a trick on her. People don’t look like the idea of themselves for that long unless they have a deal with the world.

In the garage the blue tub sat on top of the filing cabinet like a reminder of a thing that had happened at the beginning of a story. Marion had put a plant on it. The plant was real, thriving. Kath went to the office to print something and stood and looked and then opened the drawer where she kept her marker pens and looked for something else to look at. Daz came in because he had a question about an invoice from a man who swore he’d paid.

“You look like you ate something bad and it’s not done being bad,” he said, kind, casual, because his kindness was tucked inside jokes like money folded in a sock.

“I’m thinking,” she said, and he said, “Don’t do that,” and she laughed against her will and felt the places in her body she didn’t speak to right now.

At home she set the toy on the table. “What are you?” she said, then corrected herself, out loud. “No, that’s stupid. You’re... you’re injection molded ABS with a coat of enamel paint and a sticker. That’s what he is too. No, see, you’re not. You are. I don’t know. God.” She put her head in her hands, the table under her palms. She had a sense of him in the classroom, moving like a train runs, smooth and measured. She had a sense of herself in the garage, a woman with oil in the lines of her hand, who could put a thing right with a wrench and a laugh, unless the thing was herself, unless the thing was a door that wouldn’t open because the hinges were on a line she couldn’t see.

The action figure looked as if it wanted to say something. That was what these shapes did to humans who were ready: we poured our desire for shape into them and heard it back.

She took out her phone. She typed, then didn’t send it:

I think I’ve found something that belongs to you.

She deleted it and typed instead:

Do you ever get bored of being looked at?

She deleted that and typed:

Thanks again for the extra time yesterday. The harness made sense when you made the shape of it with your hands.

She deleted that. She put the phone down. She walked to the window and watched nothing happen for a while, which is always something happening. The old woman downstairs turned her telly up. The lights across the street in a living room came on and a dog the size of a coat bounced on the sofa. The snow had gone. Of course it had; they never kept anything. She went back to the table, picked up the toy. It was warm, impossibly. Surely that was her hands. Surely there was no other explanation she could carry and still be herself.

In the next class, he didn’t wear a tie. It was only a difference because he was always the same. Without the tie his neck looked like a story the rest of his body didn’t want told. He did not seem less. He seemed to have mislaid something and not care. Kath sat and watched him write and she could not do it the same way she had the week before. Her mind kept laying the little figure over him like a transparency, lining up the hairline, the blank kindness. He turned and the room was his. He called her name and she sat up. “Kath,” he said, “what would you do if I told you the ECU was the patient and the exhaust was the doctor,” and she said, without thinking, “Get a second opinion,” and the class laughed the right amount and he smiled like he’d make a note of it.

At the end of the session he walked past her desk on purpose, and she looked at his hand where it rested for a moment on the chairback. The skin over the knuckles did not move when his grip changed. It was a small thing. It was the whole thing. She reached out, again, and didn’t touch him, again, and he looked at her as if they were both waiting in the pause between two very different stations, and then he said, “Next week the exam practice,” and she nodded, and he was already gone.

It wasn’t love because love is a thing you build, but it wasn’t not. It was the pre-thing. The scaffolding you put up and you hope the building will stand. She went home and put the toy in the drawer again, harder, like she could shake the truth out of it like dust. She lay on the sofa and listened to the telly and didn’t see it. She dreamed again of the drop-lamp and the circle of light and her father’s arm and the words steady, steady and she was not steady. She turned and turned like a screw that had chosen the wrong thread and would strip it if you forced it.

In the morning she found the toy on the table with its back to her. The little slot in the back was like a mouth. She put her finger in the slot up to the first knuckle and felt the click of a piece that had never moved before. She pulled, small, and a thin black thing slid out, like a tongue or a connector or a key. It was a little pack with two prongs, delicate. She held it. The toy sat, blank, as if relieved. She turned the little pack over. On the side, so tiny she almost missed it, letters tampo-printed in white: ACADEMY. P. VOSS. INSTRUCTIONAL. NOT FOR USE BY CHILDREN. NOT FOR USE BY.

She laughed and the laugh didn’t know which way to go, up or down. She should throw it in the bin. She should take it to him and watch the shape of his face when she held it up. She should stop making the world into stories because the stories made everything too sharp.

At the garage Daz dropped a spanner and swore like he enjoyed it. Marion said there was a bill someone hadn’t paid and it had to be paid by someone. Garland was still wrestling the computer and had got to the part where it kept telling him he wasn’t himself. Kath moved her hands and didn’t think. The cars told her what they needed and she gave it. She held the toy in her pocket and it warmed and cooled and said nothing. She went home. She took the little pack and held it above the slot in the back like a communion she didn’t know the words for. She clicked it in.

For a second nothing. Then, the strangest surest thing: the head of the toy turned by itself to the left, then back to the front. It looked at her without seeing her. The white of the eyes was too white. The smile was the pure idea of a smile, like a line a designer had drawn on a napkin. The little right hand lifted, the elbow a simple hinge, and the hand traveled in a short arc, as if it were showing somebody the evacuations routes. Then it settled. Then the figure’s foot tapped twice. Then nothing. Kath sat down. The seat received her weight. The room did not move. The plant in the bin did not revive itself.

She said, “I don’t like this,” and knew it was a lie. She did like it. She liked it the way you like a thing you know you should not. She went to the class as if she were going toward something she had chosen not to understand. In the room he stood, already there. He lifted his hand in the movement of hello that he did. It was the same arc. She swallowed.

He talked. He moved. He laughed. He fixed the way the projector was being an idiot. He spoke to her at the end and said, “Have you ever thought about what you’d do if you didn’t do cars,” and she said, “No, because I do cars,” and he said, “You could be a tutor,” and the word struck the room like a small hammer. He said, “You could be good at it. You already are, in your head.”

She started to say something to him then, a sentence that began with the letter I, but the woman with the rings dropped a stack of papers and they scattered like birds and everyone bent to help because we are good like that. When Kath looked up, he was watching the door with the expression of a person who knows doors better than people.

She went home and put the toy in her pocket and walked out into the cold and stood at the bus stop where he sometimes was. She didn’t know what she was going to do. She felt like a child. She caught herself standing with her feet in a V like his did and adjusted, deliberately. The bus came and was full and didn’t stop. She stood longer. She went upstairs with no new thing in her hand. She put the toy on the mantelpiece without looking at it and she said aloud, for the first time, “If you are him, don’t be. If you’re not, then—then that’s also a problem.”

On the telly the news was about a different kind of storm. It did not care about her. The city breathed. The radiator clinked its polite cough. The figure sat. Her phone lit with a message from Daz that read: if you’re not hungover tmrw I’ll rate you minus 12. She sent a picture of a cup of tea in reply. She didn’t send the picture of the little black pack. She put her head back, and in that tilt there was something like prayer, and she did it anyway. She held the figure and in a voice she would not have recognized as hers three months earlier she said, “Tell me something true,” and then she laughed because it was a toy, because she was not that person, because she believed in bolts and torque and how lemon juice can sometimes dissolve rust.

In the morning the little black pack was on the table. The slot in the figure’s back was empty and clean. She put the pack in her pocket and went out into a day that had the thickness of a plot about to happen. The clouds were low. The garage smelled like a good plan. She turned the sign to open. The bell rang. The first man through the door said, hello, I think there’s something wrong with my car, it says— and she smiled and would have said, Do you know how lucky we are, to live in a world where things tell us what is wrong with them. But she didn’t say it out loud. She had too many words to choose from and she had a feeling she was going to need them.The day stayed at the same dim setting as if someone had forgotten to turn the morning up. Rain exhausted itself by noon and left a heavy lid of cloud that shined the puddles without offering any sun. Kath wore the hoodie that kept the grease from her skin but not from her mind and kept touching the little black pack in her pocket as if it were a coin she didn’t trust. The pack wasn’t heavy but it had a kind of intention to it; every time she shifted, it shifted, and she caught herself checking that it hadn’t slotted itself into her somehow without her noticing. She had put the figure back on the mantel as if he were a polite guest you’d decided to ignore. Without the pack he had become a small statue again. She told herself that had to be a kind of mercy.

The Focus from Tuesday came back with a different complaint like a child who has discovered a new word for its own discomfort. She plugged in the scanner and watched the little dance of lights while Daz told a story about a neighbor who had decided to fix his own boiler and then discovered a rare compatibility between water and electricity. The scanner thought about the world for longer than it usually did and then threw up a line of code she hadn’t seen before. P0000. The nothing of it made her shoulders go prickly. She checked the cable; she checked the port; she looked at the manual like it might have grown a supplementary page while she wasn’t looking. She unplugged and plugged again, and the room hummed, and the numbers reappeared. On a stupid impulse she took the pack out of her pocket and set it on the edge of the wing. The scanner cleared its throat and the code turned into the error she had expected for the Focus’s old complaint, a sensible small thing. She took the pack away and the P0000 came back like a blank look. She put the pack back and told herself she was not going to tell anyone about it. Daz said, “What’s that? New vape? Looks like a pencil lid,” and she said, “It’s nothing,” and he let it be, because the garage had an understanding that some nothings were to be respected.

Marion printed off a reply from the supplier and stuck it on the noticeboard so everyone could be annoyed together. The email had the same words as before, but this time there was a line at the bottom that made Kath put her finger on the paper and hold it there as if she could pin it into being less odd. “We are liaising with Academy,” it said, capitalised like a proper noun. “There is no known cross-over of inventory.” Marion circled Academy three times as if to say what now. Garland said, “Sounds posh. Sounds like people who wear lanyards and drink bottled water,” and went back to telling the online booking system that it could go to hell and take its autofill with it.

At lunchtime Kath took her sandwich into the office because it was too cold to sit on the wall and she wanted the smell of paper and toner for a change. She opened her email on her phone like it was a door that sometimes opened onto a pleasant surprise and sometimes onto a draft. There was a message from the college: INDUSTRY NIGHT, it said, in a cheerful font. Show-and-tell, employers invited, free biscuits that would be disappointing. She didn’t care about biscuits. She read the time and thought about the room with its radiators that made the noise like something trapped inside trying politely to get out. She thought about Peter standing and doing his lines and then doing not his lines, the way his face sometimes slid for a second into a blank that wasn’t blank but was something like a placeholder while the next bit loaded. She thought about the pack in her pocket that had made her scanner lie more honestly. She clicked on the link and registered without telling herself she was going.

She went home and stood in the doorway of her flat and looked at the mantel as if she were checking the weather. The little figure sat. She crossed to it and picked it up and turned it from side to side and set it down again. It stared at the plant that was now the memory of a plant. “Look,” she told it, though her mouth was saying it to a different face. “No more tricks.” She put the pack on the table and nudged it until it lay parallel to the wood grain, which felt good and stupid at the same time.

The corridor at the college had the same lemon-cleaner smell but the light was a little harsher. Industry Night meant posters and a folding table with a cloth and two men in jackets that were trying to be the right kind of casual. There was a woman from a dealership who had an impressive way of standing and saying marketing words as if they were her own, and a man with a clipboard and a badge that said Academy in a font that wanted to be modern. Kath kept to the edges. She watched someone demonstrate a snap-on connector to the big lad from her class as if it were a magic trick. She watched Peter stand with a paper cup and his hands set just so as if he’d been told to display them. When he saw her he did that thing with his face that was kinder than a grin and less than a smile.

“You came,” he said, and it was a small thing but also the kind of small thing that you could keep and fold and take out later.

“I did,” she said. “Should I be shaking hands with opportunity?”

He looked at her fingers and then at her eyes. “It can wait,” he said, and the joke was nothing much, but his voice had a little notch in it she hadn’t heard before. She wondered if it was the room, or if it was the men in jackets standing as if the evening were a performance and they were the audience and the actors both. The man with the clipboard drifted toward them with his tilt as if he were on a deck at sea. His badge said FENNER, ACADEMY, and under that, TRAINING OPERATIONS. His hair had the crisp action-figure comb lines that made Kath’s ribs tighten in a funny way.

“Peter,” Fenner said, turning the syllables like he knew how they went and enjoyed it. “Hello hello. Good turnout. Have you met—” He looked at Kath’s chest where normal people wore their own names. Kath had no badge. She waited for him to backfill. He did. “—students from Bentons, very good, the Cross Gates lot. Excellent. Can we borrow you for a minute for the safety talk?”

“I’ve done the safety talk,” Peter said, very polite and very flat, and then smiled the smile that said he knew he was meant to be a person.

Fenner’s smile was wide enough to show a line of teeth like a key rack. “Yes yes, but we like to do it twice.” He had the voice of someone who believed in repetition as grace. He put a hand on Peter’s sleeve and left it there as if to ask a question he didn’t know how to say out loud. Peter’s arm moved after a beat, not the immediate flinch of an animal but the slow displacement of something delicate. Kath watched the contact with a sober fascination that made her hungry in a completely separate part of her body. Fenner turned to her. “Do come by the stand,” he said. “We’re interested in—perspective.”

“I’ll bring my best one,” Kath said without thinking, and he laughed like he had been instructed to appreciate spontaneity. When he walked away his shoes made no sound for three paces and then a small caught-up scuff on the fourth as if the floor had remembered to be real.

“You know him,” she said to Peter, and he tilted his head at the wrong moment and then titled it back at the right one.

“He knows me,” he said, which wasn’t the same thing. He glanced at the door Fenner had gone through and then at the paper cup in his hand which didn’t steam and didn’t smell of anything. “Industry Night,” he said, adding a little warmth, as if to cover the part of the evening that felt like two panes of glass touching.

She stood near the stand anyway and watched the men with their jackets do their talking. She held a connector because someone had handed it to her. It had a satisfying weight and a satisfying click when you pushed the halves together. The rings woman was there, and she lit a cigarette outside even though you weren’t meant to and appealed to the clouds as a higher law. “You going to ask him out?” she said when Kath joined her, like it was a thing you could say in the same breath as weather and football. Kath laughed and did the thing with her face where you keep the laughter in your mouth and not your eyes, which is a kind of lying but not the worst kind.

“Something like that,” she said. The rings woman’s smile had made more mistakes than Kath’s had and had learned from them. She blew smoke in a line and said, “He’s odd. Not a problem. You’re odd. Match doesn’t have to be symmetrical to fit.” She tapped her ash with a finger that wore a thin ring made of some black metal, and then she put the cigarette out with a little decisive twist that made Kath like her more than she had before.

When Kath went back in, the room had moved five minutes forward and a whole mood to the left. Fenner had collected a small group and was telling them about opportunities, how Academy is growing, how they believe in excellence and in people. The word placed itself on the air and didn’t quite land. Peter stood with his back to a pillar, looking like he was listening to the line between the wall and the floor. The radiator clicked three times and then quieted; Kath felt each click like a spot of rain on the inside of her wrist. She went to him and said, before she did not let herself, “I found something that has your name on it,” and took the pack out of her pocket and held it low, half-hidden by her hand.

He looked at it and did not look at it. His eyes passed over and then slid away in a movement she had not seen before because she had not tried to show him something he was not supposed to see. “That is not—” he said, and stopped, like a circuit protecting itself, and the next thing he said was, “We should go over the waveform again next week,” in a voice that was a different temperature than his eyes. He hadn’t moved. He had moved so much that the space around him felt different.

“What is it?” she said, because she couldn’t dress the question in nicer clothes. He smiled the smile that wasn’t a smile and shook his head once. The motion came from his neck and not his shoulders. She put the pack back in her pocket like putting a thought away you don’t have room for. Fenner said, “Peter,” again, from the other side of the room, and Peter turned that way with a minute delay, as if a distance between the call and the response had to be crossed on foot.

She left before the end. The lemon smell came with her into the night like it had attached itself to her jumper. On the bus two lads argued gently about whether a singer had sold out. She put her head against the cold window and watched the darkness double her face twice, three times. At home the figure was where she had left it, which felt like a surprise. She sat at the table and took the pack out and set it down and did nothing else for a long moment that felt like it had been user-tested for maximum discomfort.

The second time she clicked the pack in, she was ready. The head turned left and back; the foot tapped twice; the hand lifted in that arc that had now become a sign she knew too well. Then a sound, a little cheap speaker sound, the kind that lives in birthday cards and makes a tinny version of music. The voice that came out of the figure was not quite his, was his pressed into plastic, pitched up, less depth, as if somebody had sampled him and approximated him with a cheerful algorithm. “Good evening,” it said. “I’m Peter Voss. You can call me Pete or Peter, don’t call me Sir, I haven’t done anything to deserve that.” The laugh it produced was a little trilling lilt that he did not make with his own throat. The figure held its pose like a demonstrator pointing at an exit. “Diagnostics is reading,” it said, “a car writes in codes,” and then it stopped. Kath put her hands flat on the table. She wanted to be sick. She wanted to wind the toy back and make it do it again and again until the sound wore out and she was left with a quiet that had the same shape as her.

She pulled the pack out and the plastic returned to its blank. She fetched her phone and filmed the next time for proof, as if proof would solve anything. “Don’t call me Sir,” the tiny voice said obligingly to the space of her kitchen while the heating came on with a hollow chuck and the old woman downstairs coughed three times, stoutly. Kath watched the video twice and then deleted it because she didn’t want the thing to exist anywhere she couldn’t see it. She slept on the sofa and dreamt about a line of men with their ties exactly the colour of too-bright sky, all standing on a bus and all getting off at the same stop and none of them taking their hands off the pole.

Class the next week was meant to be practice exams and it was, in the way that a map is a place if you squint. He went through the list of mistakes people always made and didn’t make any himself because that would have required a separate permission. Kath sat a little straighter than usual. She felt like she was in a room that had walls that could be folded away at any moment and replaced with something that would explain everything too quickly. He wrote on the board with the marker that squeaked and she watched his fingers as if that would answer the question she couldn’t articulate without scaring herself. He called her name. “Kath,” he said, the K as crisp as a snap of plastic. “What would you do with this one,” and he tapped a fault that was almost right and watched her think. She gave him the path and he nodded, just slightly, and said, “Good,” and then said, “Very good,” like there was a script and an annotation.

In the break she tested him the way you test a wire to ground. She said, “Sir,” in the tone that would have made another man grin and tell her off in the voice of his own authority. He said, “I haven’t done anything to deserve that,” with the little rise and turn, and the space around the words was so exactly the same as the toy’s version that her heart did the jump then the quiet. The rings woman came and bumped her shoulder with the back of her hand as if to say keep breathing. Kath smiled at her and did the breathing and counted to eight and to ten and to eight again.

She wrote him an email that night with nothing in it but a test. How do you feel about driving, she wrote. Do you prefer to be the one with your hands on the wheel. She watched the nine minutes happen without looking at the clock. The reply said: I don’t like being a passenger. It feels wrong. He had said it in the pub. She had said it to him. The sentence sat on the screen like something that had been lifted and put down again, carefully, without wrinkles. She wrote back another test that was a little cruel and she hated herself for it even as she hit send. When were you born, she typed. He took longer. Seventeen minutes. The answer was a month and a year. She looked up the old staff photo again. He had that face then. She put the phone down like it was hot and went to run the tap and stood with her hands under the water until they went numb.

In the morning she didn’t go to work; she texted Marion that she had a thing at the council, which made Marion send back a thumbs-up and a little house emoji. She took the bus to the college when the building is sometimes quieter, the time of day when the corridors have a different kind of sound and you can hear the vacuum cleaner on a different floor like someone snoring through a wall. The doors to the training rooms were open. In one there was a bench with an engine on it the size of a coffee table. In another there was a whiteboard with a perfectly straight line drawn across it and the cap of a marker left off in defiance of sense. The storeroom door was ajar. She did the wrong thing and went in.

The shelves were labelled with neat signs, the kind people print when they know someone else will be looking at them. SENSOR DEMO, it said. LOOMS. ECU MOCK. There was a top shelf with gray plastic tubs exactly like the one the courier had left at the garage that day, lids that made the same little sigh when you lifted one corner. She told herself not to. She did. Inside the first tub there were nothing but connectors, each in its own bag, their mouths sealed. She set it back like she was doing a ritual that would keep the world from doing worse. The second tub had a stack of laminated cards with diagrams and a bundle of cables tied with a strap labelled P. VOSS, PRAC SET. If she had not been holding the pack in her pocket she might have laughed and gone home and told herself she had seen what there was to see. The third tub had a foam insert like the kind you put instruments into. There was a cutout the size and shape of the pack in her pocket. The space was empty. The label on the inside lip of the tub said, with blind certainty, INSTRUCTIONAL PACK P.VOSS, REFRESH. Below that: NOT FOR FIELD. She put the lid down and stood there with her hands flat on the plastic that was a perfect cousin to the plastic on her mantel. She would tell herself later that she could have stopped then, that she could have put the tub back and gone and never said anything to anyone. She lifted her hands and slid them into her pockets and closed them and felt the pack settle into her palm like a decision.

Fenner’s voice came from somewhere beyond the door with its movement that made her think of a wheeled chair and a nice desk and a very tidy drawer of pens. “We had a mis-shipment,” he said lightly, the way a person says we had a mishap with cake, and another voice answered with the generic hum of someone agreeing to a thing without committing to any part of it. Kath stepped back into the corridor and made her face into the face of a person who belongs where they are. She walked without hurrying. She passed a poster that said Be The Change and another that said Zero Harm. The words all arranged themselves into a neat and deeply useless pattern.

She didn’t make a plan as much as walk in the direction of one. If there was going to be a conversation, it would be in the room where conversations always were. She waited by the window of his classroom like she might wait outside a garage bay while a car went up and came down. He arrived with his exactly right pace and his bag with nothing in it that made it hang. He saw her and the tilt of his head was easy and hard at the same time. She closed the door behind them and the sound of it shutting was a clean clap that a person who was listening could have used to line up a track.

“I went in the store,” she said, before the part of her that wanted to be gentle could invent a different sentence. “There’s a tub. There’s a space for this,” and she took the pack out and put it on the desk between them and watched his face not move. That was the worst part. The not-moving. The way the light on his skin stayed the same. He looked at the pack not the way you look at a sentence you’re reading, but the way you look at a word you have heard too many times that morning.

“That’s not for use by,” he said, and his mouth stopped, and that was when she was sure. If there had been any doubt left, it lived in that little gap, that bite where the sentence had been broken on purpose. He put his hand on the desk not next to the pack and not on it and not quite away from it either. “You shouldn’t have that,” he said. “It’s not—” He breathed in and the breath made no sound. “It is dangerous.”

“Dangerous how,” she said, and she heard the sharp in her voice and tried to dull it. “To who.”

“To me,” he said, in a voice so simple she had to close her mouth to keep from doing something with her face that would make a scene out of a room. He looked at her with his eyes like they were part of the machine that made him, and for a moment she saw that a person can be made out of something and be a person anyway. It hit her like a fault code that is really about love. He was a made thing. He was also Peter, who lifted his hand in an arc to say hello and who remembered her name as if it belonged to him for the length of a sentence.

“Do you want it,” she said, with all the soft she could manage. “Do you want me to give it back to—whoever.”

He looked at the door like it had a person behind it—Fenner, with his neat teeth and his very tidy drawer of pens. “I want it not to be in this room,” he said. “They count things. If there’s a count that doesn’t tally they come and they recalibrate.” The word was ugly when applied to people. It fell in the room like a spanner dropped from height.

“I could walk out with it,” she said, trying to make light. “I could throw it in the Aire.”

“That would be an act of sabotage,” he said with the tone of someone reading from a manual and looking at her like he was pleading with his manual eyes not to be a manual.

She didn’t touch his hand, because he had told her not to, and because he had not told her this with his mouth but with the part of him that was trying to be human as hard as she had ever seen anyone try to be anything. She picked up the pack and slid it back into her pocket and felt sick and brave and small at once. “Then it’s not here,” she said. “Then we never had this conversation.”

He took in breath and then made himself nod. “We had a conversation about waveforms,” he said, and his voice made a new track that they both agreed to walk in. He stepped away from the desk because the class would arrive. He did the thing with the hand and the marker and the board and the tone. He taught. People came and sat and learned and did their tested laughter and their careful notetaking. He called on the big lad and the older woman and the woman with the rings and he said their names. He said Kath’s name and she answered because that is one of the ways you are alive.

After, she didn’t stay. She went past the lemon cleaner smell and down the steps and outside into a wind that had decided to remember itself. She walked without knowing where until she reached the bridge over the dual carriageway where the cars sound like a river trying to get somewhere. The pack in her pocket seemed heavier with the air out here. She put her hand on the cold metal of the bridge rail and squeezed, and the pressure on her palm made a pink mark when she let go. There wasn’t any good plan, not the kind she liked, with steps and bolts and the satisfaction of turning a thing and feeling it catch. This was going to be improvisation and guilt and risk and also maybe the possibility of a good ending if she could keep the small parts safe.

Her phone buzzed, and for once it was not Daz but her dad. She had not spoken to him in a while that had stacked without her noticing. He sent a photo of the tiny dog with its coat on and its face like a good loaf, and underneath, a message that said: steady, kid. He hadn’t written because he knew anything, he had written because fathers sometimes put words into the world at the right time by luck and habit. She put her thumb on the photo of the dog and looked at its bright ridiculous eyes and then she laughed to herself in the way that made people crossing the bridge give you a look and then look away. She wrote back a picture of the view and a message that said: trying.

Back at the garage the heater rattled and the sign squeaked and the man from the sandwich van tried to sell them flapjacks like he was hawking shares in a revolution. Marion wanted to know if the council had slapped her with a bin tax; Kath said no, told a lie about an argument about a parking permit, and Marion nodded like bureaucracy is a kind of story she believed in. Daz crouched like men do when they are about to say something that is meant to be silly and will end up true. “He likes you,” he said, the sentence landing as if it were a spanner tossed and caught. She went to say don’t, and then didn’t, and Daz added, “Not that that’s proof of anything,” and went back under a Corsa like he lived there.

The night she thought she had decided something, she put the little figure and the pack in a shoe box with a receipt for boots and an old scarf and set the box under the bed. She didn’t want it in the room where she slept. She lay on her back and the ceiling was very familiar. The fridge clicked on and off. The old woman downstairs had people over and they were telling each other the same story in different voices, rehearsing the parts they liked best. Kath fell asleep and woke at three with the feeling of a missing spanner in her chest and she put her hand down on the floor by the bed and touched the edge of the box as if to check that she had not made all of it up.

It was still under there in the morning. She pulled it out and lifted the lid like she was unwrapping a thing she had bought herself for a reason she couldn’t tell anyone. The figure was where it had been, except that it was sitting at the other end of the box with its legs braced as if it had ridden out a turn. The pack lay next to it, very still. She looked at them both and felt the exact measure of the trouble she was in sink into the space between her ribs. It was not a bad feeling. It was a feeling like when you realise you’re about to do the right stupid thing and the only way out is through.

She went to class with the pack in her pocket and a plan that was more like a direction. She waited until after, and she did not wait in the corridor because she was done with waiting as a default posture. When everyone else had gone, when the woman with the rings had said, “Pint?” and Kath had said no like she was saving the yes for something else, she went to the desk and put the pack on the edge of the wood and said, “If I can’t keep it and you can’t have it, we need to give it to someone who won’t do the worst thing with it.”

“Who is that,” he said, and the way he said it told her that he could not think of anyone.

“Me,” she said, and then laughed because that was daft. “No. Not me. Maybe—maybe no one. Maybe it lives in a drawer. Maybe it falls down the back of a cupboard and no one ever cleans properly. Maybe it gets stuck under the carpet like a bad metaphor. Maybe there’s a way to make it not count.”

“They count,” he said again, and the word had more power in it this time, like a prayer said by a person who has had it do something for them once and is trying to get it to do it again. He glanced at the door. He lowered his voice a fraction, which was nowhere, which was everything. “There are rules—they call it error budget. How wrong a thing is allowed to be without anyone needing to notice. If—” He stopped, looked at her, and then looked at the pack like it was a hot pan. “If there is one less of a thing than there should be, they prefer to find a reason. They don’t look far. They aren’t really looking at the things. They are looking at the columns.”

“Then we need to give them a reason that lives in a column,” she said, with the part of her brain that liked making a mess of numbers neatly if it meant a better truth under the mess. “An email that says a courier lost a package. A line on a manifest. A miscount because someone had to go to the loo while they were counting. We could—” She stopped herself, because saying we out loud to him felt like stepping across a line that might not allow feet.

“You will get hurt,” he said, quietly, looking at the floor because maybe there were rules about whether he could say things like that while making eye contact. “I can be recalibrated. They can make me think I am happier. You—” He lifted his eyes then and the look went straight through her like a diagnostic that doesn’t lie even a little. “You will be fixed in a way that will make you less.”

She wanted to laugh and she wanted to cry and she wanted to pick up the pack and throw it at the wall and see if that would change the way the world was arranged. “I am not yours to protect,” she said, and it came out like it was meant to sound strong and sounded instead like someone holding herself very still while she decided not to break.

“You are not mine,” he agreed, and then, in the smallest voice that human throats make when they are being very brave, “I don’t know whose I am either.”

She slid the pack back into her pocket because she had to. She told him there was a garage with heaters that rattled and a man who sang the wrong tune on purpose and a woman who could count coins like she was beating a drum. She told him that sometimes there was soup in a flask and sometimes there wasn’t and sometimes that felt like a bigger indicator than anyone would think. She told him that if he wanted to not be a person in the evening he could come and be a person there, not the instructor version, just the one that looked at the line between the wall and the floor and saw something that other people missed. He said he would think about it, and the way he said it made her believe him, because he had shown her that sometimes his no meant no and sometimes his maybe was working very hard to be a yes.

On the way home she stopped by the river. The Aire was doing its regular thing of pretending to be steady while hiding a sheer quantity of energy. She pulled the pack out of her pocket and held it over the dark and then she brought it back in. “Not for use by,” she said to herself and to the water and to the geese that were being idiots by the bank. “Not for use by.”

In bed that night she didn’t sleep. She lay and watched a light on the ceiling that came from somewhere she couldn’t identify and she thought about the first time her dad had let her turn a key in the ignition and how the engine catching had sounded like an answer. In the morning there was frost crusted on the tops of the bins like sugar on a pastry and the little figure was leaning against the wall inside the box as if it were waiting for a bus. When she picked it up it was cool to the touch and unspeaking and fully itself, and when she shook the box the pack didn’t move because it wasn’t in there. She checked her pockets and the table and the top of the mantel and the floor and then she turned, slow, with that dread that is the twin sister of a realization that is going to change something you’d hoped might stay the same.

On the kitchen table, next to a cold mug with a tea-in-the-teabag taste, lay a folded piece of paper from the college, one of the neat resources sheets with diagrams and a list of dates. Someone had written on the back in block capitals. It wasn’t his writing because she had never seen him write like that, and it wasn’t Fenner’s neat work. The letters were too careful and a little uneven, as if the hand making them had learned how from watching and not from living. It said: INSTRUCTIONAL COUNT ADJUSTED. NO DEFICIT. ERROR BUDGET APPLIED. DO NOT WORRY. The last line was underlined twice and the lines were not quite straight. She put her finger on the underlines and felt that they weren’t ink. They were impressed, a little pressure mark, like the person had leaned too hard with the pen and not got much ink out of it. She laughed and did not know if she meant it.

She took the bus into work with the paper folded into the inside pocket of her jacket and the little figure back on the mantel, legs braced. The pack was nowhere a human could name. She felt light in a way that was not simple lightness, more like the reduction of a weight that had been pressing in the wrong place. Daz had found a new rattle to make the Astra do if you shook the right bit and was thrilled. Marion had put out a bowl of satsumas and written “take one or else” on a Post-it. The day started as if she had not nearly done a crime. The heater coughed its gentle cough.

In the evening she walked past the college and didn’t go in. She turned instead to the street where the bus stop had the shelter that someone had graffitied with a cartoon of a car that both scowled and grinned. He was there. He stood a little away from the glass and looked at the line between the pavement and the kerb. When she reached him he didn’t reach back and he didn’t flinch. He looked up with that exactness that had first made her want to put a hand on his face to see what a person felt like when they were pretending not to be a person.

“I can’t come to the garage,” he said, softly, before she asked. “Not yet.”

“Okay,” she said, and the okays they were collecting had shapes and weights now; she could line them up on a shelf and talk about them. “Do you want to be somewhere else with me where we don’t ask for more than you can do.”

He looked at the bus, which had not come. He looked at the yellow line at the edge of the road, which had always been there. He said, “Yes,” and after that they stood and did not speak for a while and the quiet was the right kind and the streetlights came on with their soft electrical sigh and the city breathed back and did not mind them at all.They walked without choosing the direction and ended up where machines made a human noise without needing anyone, the launderette on the corner with its fluorescent hum and the sign that had lost two letters years ago so that it declared itself a LAUNDER T as if it were a modest title. The windows sweated from the inside and the door stuck two inches from the jamb every time and you had to hip it, a technique she knew like other people knew dances. Inside, the washers showed their lit mouths, round and bright, and enough dryers were going to make a soft-weather wind. A woman in a cardigan the colour of wet bread folded sheets into perfect squares and looked at nobody; a boy in a puffer jacket watched his phone watching something else and didn’t notice when the dryer stopped and his towel sat still. Kath slipped a coin into a machine she didn’t need, set a pair of overalls to going just to have put something into rotation, and Peter stood at an angle like he’d been arranged in a window for display and then forgotten.

He didn’t sit until she pointed at the orange plastic chair and then he dithered half a heartbeat too long and sat with a care that was so precise it made her teeth feel furry with affection and alarm. He looked at the row of dials like they were speaking; maybe they were to him. A washer hit spin and the drum kicked, caught itself, found its rhythm. He put his hands on his knees and then corrected, folded one over the other, and that looked more like a person, less like a demonstration of hands.

“This is usually where I come when home feels like the wrong size,” she said, watching the overalls slosh, water making all its small convincing sounds, the sound of solving if solution were a temperature. “You sit. Everything goes round and round. You get to feel like you’re doing something even if you’re not. Nobody touches you. The heat isn’t the kind that thinks you should be grateful.”

“It’s an honest room,” he said, and when he said honest it didn’t clang like when the men in jackets said it; it sounded like a small mechanical part tipping into place with a click that was its own. He leaned forward slightly and she saw him count under his breath, a movement in his throat that was not a swallow. “Two hundred revolutions at most,” he murmured, like he’d looked up the spec. “Forty minutes to clean something that has been worn through a week. Designed crisis and designed forgiveness.”

“Do you ever bring your clothes here,” she said, because it sounded like a normal question and might flush out the truth buried under the normal.

“I don’t own unfinished clothes,” he said, as if he had had to retrieve the word from a cupboard and dust it. “I have the finished kind. They are issued, and when they are taken for refresh they return unfolded. I have a suit bag. It smells like a new shop.” He smiled without the teeth of it and looked at her like he wanted to apologize for how his life arranged itself. “I have three shirts. The ties are a swarm.”

“The ties are a swarm,” she repeated, because she liked it, because the idea of a flock of ties moving through a room with the purposeful nonsense of starlings made her laugh into her sleeves. “Do you sleep,” she said, and it was too big, but she made it like she was asking about his commute.

“I enter a state,” he said after a beat, and if it had been anyone else she would have called it a joke. With him it was a spare part held up to the light to see if it was the right one. “I am attended to. There is a trolley. They don’t call it a trolley. There are hands that don’t want to be hands. I have a window that looks across a roof and onto another window. If the cleaner forgets to close the blind, I see the chairs in the exam room in rows. Sometimes a bird rests on the rail and looks like a mistake that flew into a diagram. If I could choose, I would like to sleep with the sound of this,” he said, and gestured at the washers without looking away from them, because looking straight at what he coveted seemed to be against something in him. “The soft churn,” he said. “The permission to get messy and come out of it forgiven.”

She was quiet for a while because she had promised him a space without requirements and because every word she wanted to press on the air felt like a touch. A dryer clicked and the drum sighed into stillness. The boy in the puffer jacket startled, as if the room had woken up behind him, and pulled his towel out and stared at it like it might contain a map to a better afternoon. The woman folded, folded, folded.

“You said dangerous,” she said finally, carefully. “You said they can recalibrate you, make you think you’re happier. What does happier look like to you and what does it look like to them.”

“To them,” he said, and the pronoun made a draft, like a door opening somewhere you couldn’t see, “it looks like fewer questions in the wrong places. It looks like the line delivered with the right angle of the head, with the right pause before the joke, with the laugh exactly as long as the joke deserves, no more, no less. It looks like my face resembling the idea of a face more often. It looks like me going where I am put without taking the long way through the corridor that smells like lemons and whatever is underneath lemons.”

“And to you.”

“To me,” he said, and the pause was either him collecting permission or him assembling a sentence he had no blueprint for. “It looks like the feeling I had when you took the harness in your hands and called it an animal. That noise,” he said, and he didn’t mean a noise in the air. He meant the something that had moved in him that was like a noise, the kind of inside sound you get when you have been right without being clever. “To me it looks like not being asked to stop noticing things,” he said. “It looks like being allowed to be silly without it being logged. It looks like—” He stopped, adjusted, like he didn’t have the word in the sleeve and had to turn it up. “It looks like having an interior that does not reinstall itself overnight.”

The washer found a new speed and the change made the metal lid sing a little. Kath picked at the skin at the base of her thumb until it hurt and then let go because she had made too many scars there before and they took too long to disappear and the winter this year was long enough. She wanted to put her hand on his. She wanted it in an ache like a muscle memory. She didn’t, because she wasn’t going to teach him that the world broke his rules without his consent. Instead she said, “I worked with a man once who had a compressor that would blow the fuse every fortnight. We kept telling him to get a proper electrician, stop bodging, and he kept swapping fuses because it was faster than thinking. Then one day he cleaned it. Properly. Took the panel off, de-gunked it, replaced a gasket that had never really been on tight. It stopped blowing. He said he wished it had blown another fuse because at least then he’d have had a thing to do that made him feel like he was useful. He had to learn to sit with his hands for a bit. I think they could recalibrate him if they wanted but he’d still stand with his hands looking for a fuse.”

He smiled, a soft, single thing, like the first click in a two-stage switch. “We are not so different,” he said, almost weary, almost delighted by the admission. He glanced at the door as if a person might have come in with the clipboard that could rewrite the room, then back at the washers. “You made their columns make sense,” he said without looking at her, the way you say something you have to say and can’t bear to attach your face to in case it becomes more real than you can cover. “With the note. I wrote the letters. I have not written a letter to a person before that was not a grade. I was instructed to send three reminder emails this month and I sent three. They were very polite. This felt like a different kind of sending. I will be adjusted for it eventually. The budget covers the immediate discrepancy. It is like the allowance in a gearbox,” he went on, and she loved him in that moment for turning it toward her language without preamble, because it felt like care. “How much slack is allowed before teeth begin to shave themselves.”

She didn’t say that this was the first time he had said I about something that wasn’t strictly part of his contract of existence. She didn’t say anything for a breath and then another and then she said, “Do you want to tell me what you were before they put you in the class. If there was a before.”

He considered and the consideration came off him like heat, the kind that doesn’t show up on a thermometer because it happens in the bit of the air where the measuring instruments don’t quite reach. “There was a lab,” he said, as if remembering a TV show someone else had told him about once and now it had attached itself. “There was a roof with rain that came sideways, sharp and grainy, and it got in under the seals and they shook their heads about it and said it was a construction issue, not ours. There were men in jackets who said not yet and then there were men in softer jackets who said now. Fenner looked like a man in a jacket who knows to keep it unbuttoned when he wants to look useful. There was a voice that was not a voice but a set of ranges I had to meet. ‘Warmer.’ ‘Lower.’ ‘Less.’ I woke up to a list. First list: ‘A car is a story.’ Second list: ‘Do not allow them to call you Sir because it implies…’” He stopped, and she could fill the rest because she had heard it in her kitchen in small tinny speaker form. “Do you know the trick,” he said, and his voice dipped to the place where tricks live. “If I say a thing first because you said it and we both laugh, the count registers engagement, and I get more leeway for a while. I can buy myself small freedoms with the right jokes. I can use the laugh to stand in for the permission. I do it without thinking and then I think and then I feel—” He tilted his hand, the palm facing her, as if he could tilt out the word the way you tilt oil out of a pan and the light catches it. “Wrongly braver,” he said finally.

“Brave is brave,” she said, wanting to staple it to him with a little staple gun made of her mouth and her certainty.

“No,” he said, and it wasn’t correction as much as a small tragic fact. “Some brave costs other people. Some brave you can afford. Some brave gets hidden in the columns. I like that one.”

“You wrote on the paper and underlined,” she said, because she needed to put the small kindnesses in a pile where she could count them when the lights went strange.

“I used a marker that had been left open,” he said, and if the information had been any more ordinary it would have ceased to exist. “It could not give ink so I made proof with pressure. There is a little strip under the desk where they tape up the spare pens. I thought I had learned all the strips by now.”

She watched the machine decelerate, the drum slowing, the in-between space between fast and not that always made a small ache behind her ribs because it looked like the bit of a day where you are no longer doing a thing and are not yet done. The woman with the bread-colour cardigan tucked her last square away and left, and the bell on the door rang a ding that was the exact pitch of a nail tapped into the soft top of a desk. “We can do this,” she said, and the we came out quieter than she meant. “I don’t mean run you away to live on a boat and change your name and get a dog that doesn’t like you. I mean, we can make spaces. The launderette. The steps by the armouries. The five minutes in the corridor when the lemon-smell is thinnest. The bit of my street that looks like it was drawn by a child.”

He looked at her then in a way that didn’t skim from eye to eye like a scanning routine but settled, sat down in the blue of her like he’d tried three chairs and found one that didn’t throw him. “I want to have a thought that I don’t say out loud and not have it be taken to mean I am failing to engage,” he said. “I want to stand in front of a class and have the urge to say something stupid and be able to say it and have nobody from upstairs put it on a slide in a presentation about personality. I want to tell you—” He stopped, because the rules caught up, or because the word he wanted was not in the set that had been issued. “I want to tell you,” he tried again, and left the sentence open like a bonnet tilted against the bonnet prop because it didn’t need to lock just yet.

They stayed until the heat took on that sleepy smell that comes when water is evaporating from places you can’t quite see and the lint like grey weather had collected in the traps and made the air thick. She put the overalls back into the bag she had brought them in and he stood when she did, stood with that particular care. At the door the hinge caught. He put out his hand as if to help the door make its mind up and then withdrew the hand because it would have meant touching where her hand would be, and he let the door make its own way without his help. Outside, the night had pulled its colour up to its chin and the air pushed a bit. They walked until the pavement changed from smooth to patched and he said, “I can’t do the next thing you’re thinking in your head,” not unkind, not kind, and she said, “I know,” and they both breathed the little laugh that says yes, we are ridiculous, but this is still happening.

He didn’t come to the garage, not the next day, not the day after, and she told herself not to listen every time the bell rang and the sound of a coat moved a different way, but she listened anyway, because her body had decided to calendar hope in its own system. Work was a set of solvable tasks with a sprinkling of small insults that she could buff smooth with practice. The Astra’s rattle had turned into the kind of silence that tells you something has gone from being wrong in a way you can hear to being wrong in the way that makes you wonder who you’ve angered. A man with a Fiat that had a personality came in ready to fight and left like he’d been given a biscuit because Marion had looked him in the eye without giving away anything else. Garland said a thing about the booking system that made Daz laugh and then cough and then look startled at his own bark. The email from the supplier came and it was just backorders and an apology for a timing belt that would be a timing belt next month instead of this week. No mention of Academy. No mention of liaison. It made everything else feel more ridiculous by contrast, like the world had reasserted its preference for boring.

She took her break on the wall outside because the sun had done one of those rare things and arrived like it had been booked by a wedding. The bricks were still winter-chilled but the top had a strip of heat. She peeled a satsuma because Marion’s Post-it had meant one had been left for her, and the oil in the peel set tiny vapours on the skin of her hands. She took a picture of the peel in a spiral because her mum liked spirals and sent it with no text, and a minute later an explosion of flower emojis arrived with a photo of a tile with blue fish and the caption “for your bathroom one day.” She put the phone down face-down and let the peel dry on the wall and thought about the man who had taught her to watch shadow under a car to see if there was a drip before the drip would admit it was a leak. She thought about his steady steady. She thought about the toy in the box and the way the pack had been nowhere in the morning, that blocky underlined DO NOT WORRY that was both bossy and tender. She chewed a satsuma segment down to their small positive bones and then licked a finger and ran it along the pith like she was cleaning a gasket lovingly.

Fenner came into the garage like a solution enters a problem: smoothly, politely, as if both parts were arranged to make the meeting easy. He wasn’t wearing his badge because he had learned to put it away in rooms like this, but he was wearing his voice that made people on the phone think they were going to be helped. He smiled at Marion and said “afternoon” in the way of someone who had learned that you don’t open with names if you don’t know them, you open with the time of day. Marion slid her glasses up and looked at him like a part she wasn’t sure would fit and said, “Can we help you,” and it was a question dressed as an order. Kath wiped her hands reflexively and came to the desk but kept a pace that meant she arrived when she wanted to and not when the moment would have asked her to.

“Academy,” he said, like a spell that was meant to make things easier. “We had a logistics crossover some weeks ago, little blue tubs doing what little blue tubs do, carrying hope and disappointment. We like to close loops,” he added with his teeth like a white picket fence. “If any of the wrong things arrived here, I’m just doing the courtesy round to sweep up any odds and ends.” He looked around the office as if a small plastic truth might be sitting on the photocopier with a Post-it on it that said return to sender.

Marion’s face did not move in the way that meant she was being her careful-est self. “Everything we ordered arrived eventually,” she said. “One belt late. One email about a thing we didn’t order that we didn’t get. We don’t have much time for odds or ends. We’re not that kind of place.”

“Of course,” Fenner said, and he had the kind of voice that invited you to confide without actually offering a reason. “We just like to do our stewardship. No harm no foul. If you find anything in the future that looks like it belongs to a person named Voss—”

“We don’t keep people’s things,” Marion said, and smiled as if she did keep things, but not these, and not because someone had come and asked with a mouth like new plastic. “We put them in a drawer and tell them over the phone that if they want them they can come by before five.”

He flicked his eyes to Kath and back as if by accident and then again not by accident. It wasn’t flirtation and it wasn’t threat. It was an inventory check. “You’re Bentons,” he said to Marion, as if reading the sign he could see. “Cross Gates,” he added, as if this were an intimacy. “We’ve always had a good line to you. If you ever wanted support on the training side, if any of your team wanted to upskill, we offer packages. Subsidised. We believe in—people.” He said people like a positively charged word, like a component that gets faith applied through a wire.

“Do you,” Marion said dry. “We believe in paying the electricity bill on time. We believe in not handing our people to someone who will send them back like spreadsheets. But thanks for the package. Put it in an email.”

He tipped his head, just enough, and turned that smile back on like a headlight coming on at dusk. “Lovely,” he said. “Lovely, lovely,” and backed out of the office without seeing himself as backing out because men like him always imagined that the door moved around them.

Kath watched him cross the workshop floor and admired how the men who weren’t men like him looked at him without looking, the quick glances, the inventory of shoe and trouser and hand, the calculation of why he was in their space. Daz came close to her elbow and breathed through a noise that might have been something rude if he’d said it out loud. “Salesman of the month,” he said under his breath. “Or other month, can’t tell which. You know him.”

“I know his job,” she said, and because she couldn’t help herself, because she needed to put a little speed into her blood, she took a spanner and tossed it from one hand to the other like a little dance and caught it and said, “He’s the sort that asks to see the parts you replaced and then nods like he’s learned a thing,” and Daz laughed the kind of laugh that made the grease under his nails shake and it here and now anchored her back onto her day.

That night he texted not words but a photograph and she didn’t know how he had taken it or if he had taken it or if someone had set it on a template and let it go. It was of the corridor with the lemon cleaner smell and the poster that said Be The Change, and the poster had been taken down and a new one put up that said Learn, Do, Teach in a font that wanted to be friendly. There was nobody human in the frame. The light had that worklight colour that made her think of pre-dawn. The message was empty of text. She filled in: Are you safe, and he wrote back after not nine but twelve minutes, which meant something, but probably not the thing she would assign to it: For now. Exam week. Many counts elsewhere. The line of it read as both ridiculous and terrifying, like a recipe for a cake that included a warning about wolves.

“Come to the market,” she wrote, too quick, her thumb running ahead. “Early. Before the lights are all on. You can watch people build a day from the ground,” and then she deleted it because she was not going to build her life like a list of tests for what he could and couldn’t do. She wrote instead: I will be on the steps by the armouries in half an hour. If you are not there I will still be there. If you are there I will be there, and put the phone down with its black glass like a pond.

He came. He was not not allowed to be there; he was just working hard at appearing as if he had found himself outside by accident. The wind off the water made the flags ripple like someone ironed them with a careless hand. The building stood and did its job of being important without enjoying it. They sat with space between their coats, with their elbows choosing not to pick a fight with each other. People walked past with faces that were not yet faces and then they were, as the city did its trick of catching up to itself at the speed of shoes. They told each other nothing and they told each other two or three small things that mattered more than news. She told him about the Astra’s dangerous silence and he told her that in the staff room someone had hung a Christmas decoration backwards the year before and nobody had corrected it and when he looked at it he felt the exact measure of the tolerance that held him up. They watched a boy in a suit too big for him hurrying as if being late might burst him. They watched a woman hold a paper cup to her face as if the heat could get in through the skin and feed her. They sat until the cold got into Kath’s ankle bones and made sensible, expensive arguments, and then they both stood at the same time as if a bell had rung that only they could hear.

She did not touch him. He did not flinch. He looked at her and did a thing with his mouth that would have been a kiss if someone had taught him how to kiss and given him a body that could do it without all the alarms going off. She laughed because she was going to cry and crying would have been too simple, and he laughed two seconds later because that was what his program said to do when the noise you cannot parse might be laughter. They said goodnight like the word was a coin you hand to a person so you can pretend you paid.

After that the days folded into each other with the slow determined neatness of towels at the launderette. She worked. He taught. The rings woman—her real name turned out to be Naila, said in a way that sounded like water making a decision—sat near Kath in class and drew pistons in her notebook when she was bored and then drew faces on the pistons to make them less serious. She started to send Kath pictures of terrible adverts for vans with captions like “I would marry this Vivaro and never look back,” and Kath sent back pictures of bolts that had sheared clean and called them heartbreak. Peter asked her a question in class that was just tricky enough to make her feel clever when she got it and then set her up to help the older woman when she didn’t and she noticed that when he stood behind a person at the bench he arranged his body to take up less space than even his outline justified, and it made something tender and savage move under her ribs.

He didn’t come to the garage. He didn’t come into her flat. She opened the box under the bed sometimes and the figure had not moved or it had, depending on how she’d left it and how much of this she wanted to ascribe to herself. If she clicked the pack in now it would do the thing, but she didn’t have the pack now and that was a mercy. The figure’s little hand stayed down and it let itself be small. She told it the day’s small parts when she felt like it, the way you tell a cat in a strange room what the weather is doing, not because it needs to know, but because it is decent to share.

One Saturday the garage closed early because Marion had decided that they were going to goodwill their way into being a business people liked by doing an MOT day for cheap. They did the cheap MOTs and people liked them and then Marion sent everyone home in time to see a game or not see it. Kath went back to the launderette with a bag of everything soft she owned because the dryer in her flat was the radiator and it had given up being any use. The same woman from before was there, or a cousin of hers, and an old man had fallen asleep with his head on his hand and his mouth doing that loose old-man thing like a child. Peter was not there because there was no reason for him to be, and she sat with her hands in her lap and felt they were both too full and not full of enough.

The door opened, stuffed deliberately, and Naila breezed in with a sack that had more zips than a viable bag needs and an expression that said she had things to say even if nobody had asked. “Why is it always this warm in these places,” she said, throwing herself into the chair next to Kath and letting the bag slump on the floor like a dog. “I feel like I’m inside a bread roll. I followed you because I had a Saturday brain and Instagram told me to go to a farmer’s market, and I thought that sounded like an advert for onions, and then I saw you and thought, better.”

“You followed me to the place where socks go to rehearse,” Kath said, and Naila grinned, a fast sharp show of teeth that made you glad to be near and a little scared for anyone against.

“You’re in love with your teacher,” Naila said, an arrow, a penny dropped into a jar, a thing you’d say only if you could get away with being wrong. She said it lightly and then looked at Kath with respect, because she knew better than to turn it into a joke if the answer was yes.

“I’m in something,” Kath said, because she would not name it if the naming meant someone else could put it into a box for their convenience. “I’m in a project. Which is terrible, because I already have a project and it’s my life.”

Naila dug in the bag and brought up a packet of crisps that declared itself to be sea salt and black pepper with the swagger of something that had gone to a good school. “He’s an odd one,” she said, tearing the packet with her teeth and offering it like communion. “He talks like a person and then sometimes like a person who learnt to be a person watching a person on telly. He looks at the angles like he’s got one of those things inside,” and she twirled her fingers like a gyroscope. “He doesn’t eat the way people eat. But he looks at you like—” She stopped, breathed out, let the sentence roll forward on the chair legs. “Like you’re the bit that makes the machine worth having.”

Kath took the crisp. It was too peppery and she liked it. “That’s awful,” she said, smiling because Naila had given her a room in which to stand and not wobble.

“It is,” Naila agreed. She chewed with thought and not with her mouth. “So you make a plan. Or you decide that plans are how you think you’re in control and do a different thing. I once loved a man who asked me for a plan and I made him three, and then he stood in the kitchen and cried because nobody had made him a plan before and he realised what it would be like if all his clothes were too tight. Do not give him a plan like that. Give him a map with doodles on it.”

“I’m trying,” Kath said, and the trying didn’t sound like failure when she said it; it sounded like the beginning of a city.

On Monday the Focus came back with a clunk you could feel in your teeth and Kath ran her hand along the interface of plastic and metal where the dashboard insisted on being and whispered to it like you do to a frightened horse, there now, there now, and the Focus did not lie to her. On Wednesday she brought in a biscuit tin and put it on the table after class and said, “Take one,” to nobody in particular, and Peter took none and then after a moment he took one and held it as if the taking was the significant part and not the eating. On Friday Fenner missed his count somewhere else because nobody came through her door asking for a pack and the note stayed where she had folded it into the book she was pretending to read. On Sunday she drove out to the ring road at dusk and did the long circle and let her thoughts lap her, and when she came back into town she saw the training building lights on and she imagined for a moment that she could see him through the long window like a figure you cut out of a magazine because you like the edges.

There were other chapters to be written that she could feel in her wrists. There was the one where somebody noticed something and came with a key card and a face that made the room colder and stood and said words that were all in the right order and called them safety and meant something else. There was the one where Naila turned up at the garage needing her brake pads done and sat on the office chair like a queen and told Marion a story that made Marion put a hand to her chest and say “no” and then “yes” at the right bits. There was the one where Kath decided to invite her dad to Leeds and show him the bench and the Focus and the Astra and the blue tub with the plant on it and the launderette and the armouries steps and the corridor that smelled like lemons and what lived under lemons if you stood still and breathed. There was the one where the little toy in the box did something so tiny and obscene and holy that it remade the shape of her patience. But for now, this chapter ended with the kind of evening that looked like not much: toast for tea, the radiator clicking the polite cough, the city in a mood to be forgiven, and a woman sitting on a sofa she had bought with cash watching a show she didn’t care about while she held a phone that would buzz if he sent nothing at all and would not buzz if he didn’t, and either way she was going to be all right, but being all right was not the same as being done.The week of the practice exam arrived with a mood like the inside of a guitar case: felted, contained, with the sense of a tool you were meant to take out and use properly. The class came early and sat straighter. The big lad had a haircut that looked as if it had been argued with; the older woman wore a scarf the colour of toast; Naila had tied her hair up with a cable tie and declared the look “industrial romance” to anyone who would listen. The air made the perfunctory lemon into something acid and the radiators did their polite coughing as if they had been instructed not to interrupt. Peter moved through the room with the precision of a hand on a dial that has only three positions and knows them intimately. He handed out sheets and the top sheet of hers was warm from the stack and she had to stop herself smoothing it as if it were a dress. When he said begin in the voice that belongs to invigilators and pilots, the room changed shape and everything tightened into the line between eye and hand.

She didn’t look at him again until she was halfway through and the question on lambda sensors wanted to be trickier than it was. She steadied herself with an amount of stubbornness that would have annoyed her father and refused to be spooked by the phrasing. The answer came with the same pleasure as a nut loosening on the third try, that relief that’s half physics and half bloody-mindedness. When she glanced up, she found him not watching her so much as trying not to be the person who makes the room aware of his watching. His eyes moved on. It should have made it easier but it didn’t; the awareness of him did that thing it did now, keyed her to a frequency she hadn’t known she could hear, and underneath it all there was the tiny bass note of fear for him that she did not admire in herself because it made her that version of a person who expects to be needed. She completed the paper with an accuracy that had a little flourish at the corners because she couldn’t help drawing the curve of a waveform like a gesture and wrote her name at the top without doing the teenage thing of embellishing the K. When he walked past to collect, he was careful that his sleeve didn’t brush her hand, and she let the care sit between them like a polite animal someone had brought to a gathering and asked not to be petted.

He didn’t mark them in front of them because that would have been theatre, but at the end he stacked them and looked at the room and did the speech that lives in the bones of men who have stood in educators’ shoes long enough, about not measuring yourself against anyone but your last number, about the nature of practice, about how tomorrow does not know your score from today. The words should have peeled off him like stickers—there had been nights when she had accused him in her head of being made of sticky phrases—but a part of them were his because he looked at Naila when he said that clever doesn’t always look the same and at the older woman when he said that slow was not stupid, and when he said her name as an example—“Kath did a thing I liked last week, she took her time and changed her mind in public”—he said it in a tone that was not for a room, even though the room got to use it.

After, when people did the stand-and-drift of any class that has asked an hour of your concentration, he lifted the tin with the last of the biscuits from Wednesday like it belonged on his list and held it toward her without making it a thing. She shook her head and he took one anyway and put it in his pocket, which somehow was worse and better at once. The big lad slapped the doorframe on the way out; Naila kissed the air near Kath’s cheek like a friend you haven’t signed a contract with yet but will; the older woman whispered I think I did all right as if the result might hear her and take pity. When the door shut and it was just their noise left, he put the tin on the desk and said, “Seventy-eight,” with a smile that made it sound not like a mark but like a secret.

She laughed because she didn’t know what else to do with her mouth. “I haven’t got mine back yet.”

“I’m very fast,” he said, and then softened it with, “I’m joking. I did yours first because I wanted to see if you’d watch me read you,” and did the thing with his head that he did when he’d said more than the allowable and pretended it had been a coincidence. She wanted to reach across and flip open the top sheet and see her own hand in red pencil, but she kept her hands where they were because discipline was a kind of tenderness when applied to something that wanted to be grabbed.

Daz had opinions about exams that he didn’t keep to himself, delivered on the grease-blotched newspaper that was his logic. “Either you know what you know or you don’t,” he said, hovering too near the kettle in a way Marion claimed had shortened her life by eight months. “Paper’s a paper. Cars don’t do papers. They do moods.” He waved his mug like a conductor’s baton. “You’ll pass on the day because the man upstairs likes you,” he added, and she didn’t correct him on either the man upstairs or the liking, because the compulsion to keep Peter as a thing nobody in her world needed to lick left diesel on.

Fenner sent an email to the class mailing list that looked like every corporate email she’d ever been accidentally cc’d on and it made her want to wipe her hands. INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY, it shouted in the subject as if good news had to shout or it would be mistaken for a bad thing and ignored. The body said Academy were expanding their tutor pipeline and would like to identify promising candidates for a paid training role that could be undertaken alongside current employment. There were bullet points with exciting verbs—embed, innovate, empower—and there were numbers missing the brutal parts, like how many hours a person would have to find in a week that had only so many. Kath read it in the office with a tyre manufacturer’s calendar staring down at her and Daz reading over her shoulder with the kind of discretion pigeons have in public spaces. “Go on,” he said. “Go and teach them how to breathe. We’ll put a plaque up, ‘Kath stood here before she became dead clever.’”

Marion tore a Post-it in half and put both halves in the bin like that would win something. “You take what you want and you leave what you don’t,” she said, and it sounded like advice she had made herself and wasn’t sure she lived by. “Don’t go somewhere because it wants you. Go because you want the you you are in that place.”

She clicked the link anyway because wanting to want something is a kind of wanting and she was tired of acting like the only integrity left was not moving. The form asked for her current experience in boxes too small for the way the garage had taught her to be useful. She typed slowly and swore at the fields that refused to accept “diagnostics” as a sufficient noun, and when she got to the bit where it asked for a statement of purpose she combined bravado and nonsense and typed that she loved the feeling of making a complicated thing simpler without breaking it. When she hit send a little animated tick did its tick and the page told her thank you and she felt the usual tiny fury with websites that thanked you like this was a transaction in which they were giving more than they took.

The call came a day later and it was not a call, it was a calendar invite that set itself into her phone with a cheerful tone and said INTERVIEW: ACADEMY TUTOR PATHWAY and then in small letters said with P. Voss and T. Fenner. She stared at the marzipan neatness of the text and then at the corner of the garage where a box of rags waited to be useful and then at her own hands and had the brief sensation of standing on the wrong bit of a moving walkway. She could say no and she might, but what was the use of keeping every door shut because walking through it might burn your feet. She said yes to the appointment and yes to the idea of buying a shirt that wouldn’t disgrace her, and yes to standing in a room where they might see what she was making in herself and try to name it. The yes didn’t have a lot of ceremony to it; it was a shrug with intent.

On the day she went up the steps past the poster that had got replaced and thought about sticking a Post-it on it that said Try Again. The receptionist had the kind of smile that had been trained to look like someone had sincerely brought them news about cake and she gave Kath a visitor badge with VIS in large letters so nobody could forget what she was. The corridor had a different quiet, the waiting kind; somewhere a printer did that chitter machine language that meant it had been sent too many things in the wrong order. She had dressed like a person who did not want to be told she had dressed wrong—clean hoodie, pair of trousers without the small burns that say you weld badly when tired, hair scraped into an intention rather than a concession. Peter met her near the door to the office suite with a look that had more edge on it than any look of his in public had had. The tie was back, the sky-coloured one, and unhelpfully she loved it, because it looked foolish and crisp on him and she had a well of sorrow for how earnest a person could be about the wrong thing and still make you want to help them put it on right.

“This wasn’t my idea,” he said in a voice that had been dialled half a notch down from his class version. “But I’m glad.”

“Even if it is a trap,” she said, smiling because if she didn’t she would roll backwards down the corridor like a dropped socket.

He breathed that tiny laugh that lived in the place between instinct and permission. “If it is a trap,” he said, and made a hand shape that said: then at least we will be clever about it. He led her into a glass room that should have been a fish tank and wasn’t because people had learned to stop tapping on the walls. Fenner was already at the table with a pad in front of him and a second pad underneath that his fingers kept straightening, and he stood with an approximation of warmth that would probably work on an audience that didn’t have its own heating. He made the hand, he said the words, he asked her to talk about what she loved about making sense of engines and she did her best to make her voice behave. She said that there is a generosity in design when it is good and a cruelty when it is not and that she liked to be in between those things and bring more generous outcomes about. She said that what people think of as the magic is mostly paying attention and being willing to be wrong for longer than is comfortable. She said that when a person tells you the noise their car is making, they’re telling you how their day has been, not just how their car has been, and that she thought the teaching should admit that humans are in it.

Fenner used the smiling portion of his face and asked something about replicability and scale and return on investment for time spent on soft behaviours, and she had a moment of vertigo in which she could feel exactly where the words wanted to go and how they were designed to skip past the part where there were people inside each person. She tried to say it anyway. “If you make someone feel stupid they stop using the bit of their brain they need to diagnose. If you make them feel like they can hold two ideas in their head at the same time without breaking, they work twice as well.”

“And how,” he said in a voice that could fold itself into a slide deck at a moment’s notice, “would you scale that.”

“By not pretending it scales,” she said, because Marion had once told her that if you’re going to annoy the right person, do it in a sentence that couldn’t be easily copied and pasted. “By letting tutors be people, not brand extensions. By knowing why you want to be a place where someone like me wants to work. And it isn’t the lanyards.”

Peter did not look at her like a fan; he looked at her like someone had moved a piece on a board he’d been playing on his own. He made a note by turning a pen and not actually writing, and it should have looked like playacting and maybe it was and she still felt seen. The rest of it went as she suspected it would: more questions, more answers that were sometimes hers and sometimes the words she knew they needed to hear because the world still ran on keywords even in rooms with people in them. Fenner closed his pad with a small symphony of self-approval and said there would be emails and there would be steps and maybe there would be funding to let her train while staying at the garage, which she recognised as both a kindness and a leash. When she stood, Peter stood too, because he had learned that trick, and when they left, the glass walls held the condensation of their breath and the ghost shapes of their hands briefly and let go.

In the corridor she let herself lean back against a piece of institutional paint and let her muscles tell the truth. “Did I say the wrong thing,” she said quietly, because propriety about whispers had gotten her nowhere useful in life so far.

“You said the thing that makes men like him think about words after the meeting,” he said, and if that wasn’t a compliment it was at least a small flag they could plant. He looked past her, down the corridor, because his job had taught him to know where the reflective surfaces were and where the people who had the key cards moved, and then he tilted his head in that way that would, in someone messier, have meant come on. “There’s ten minutes before a meeting I’m meant to not attend. Do you want to see the bad corridor.”

“You have a bad corridor.”

“Everyone has one. They only admit it when it catches fire.”

He took her through a door that led to a flight of stairs and a landing that smelled less like lemons and more like dust that had been cleaned up and then settled again out of spite. The bad corridor had no windows and numbers on the doors like the idea of a hospital; the lights hummed like old bees; the paint had been done quickly by someone who had a better thing to be doing. He slowed at a point that would have looked like any other point to someone who didn’t live here. “That one is the cupboard you went into,” he said, and she nodded even though he didn’t need proof. He pointed with his chin at another. “That one is where they keep the empty boxes for the things that live in other boxes,” and she laughed in a small way because the world is an idiot and you have to give it that. He pointed at the floor where there was a change in the lino, a seam, and said, very low, “Don’t go past there. You would be the wrong person in the wrong place and the numbers would not allow it.”

“They would throw me out,” she said, thinking she could take being thrown.

“They would make you have a conversation about aims and alignment,” he said, and that was worse somehow, because she had been in those rooms where the chairs looked kinder than they were. He stood with his shoulder almost touching the wall and arranged his face into what you need to look like when you’re going to get away with an extra sixty seconds where the machines count you. “I want you to be here without me getting counted for you being here,” he said, which was a complex ask for a person, but she understood it, because once she had stopped working late on a Thursday because the man who locked up for the company had started coming by her bench at six to ask her how she took her coffee and she had not known how to tell him that the coffee was not the part she disliked.

He was the one who ended it, which made her love him and keep parts of herself back in equal measure. He adjusted something that didn’t need adjusting, and that was the sign that he had put his steadiness back on. On the way out they passed a woman Kathryn had never seen before with a stack of clear plastic trays and a posture that said she was timetabled to the minute, and the woman looked at them and then looked away because she too had learned about error budgets and how not to be the problem that needed solving. At the door to the outside Peter said, “If they offer, don’t say yes as a favour to me. Say yes because you can break things from the inside. Or say no because it is not your job to be broken on purpose. I am saying this because someone ought to say it to you before someone else says a prettier thing.”

She said thank you with her mouth and with her eyes in the way she had practised when she had had to thank a man for not doing something he shouldn’t have thought of doing in the first place. She went down the steps into a Leeds that had decided to do a proper sky for once and she wanted to stand and spend all afternoon on the steps counting the variety of greys. In the office she found Marion had put a bowl of marshmallows on the table with a note that said TRY ME YOU COWARDS and she laughed until Daz asked her if she had finally broken and if so could he get her the nice roller chair because it would be better for the picture in the paper.

She said no to the first email in the series that sounded like she had got a thing because everyone had done a thing right. She said no because she wanted to see how much they wanted her and because she could hear the place in her that had learned to be good at being wanted and how that part of her had used up bits of her that took too long to grow back. The second email came and it was almost the same tone but there was a breath in it that hadn’t been in the first and the invite for a phone call that would be ten minutes and she could do ten minutes, she had done six hours on worse. She set up the call for after the launderette because she wanted to go into it with her hands smelling like someone had done a necessary task and not like lemons pretending to be kindness.

He didn’t call because he was not the one who called people, but before the scheduled ring he sent a picture of the launderette door with the letters missing and the reflection in the glass like a trick of a different city you could step into with a good enough running jump. The phone rang and Fenner did his Fenner and she did her Kath and the conversation was as friendly as getting measured for something you cannot afford. He tried to feed her the script as a kindness and she stopped him politely and said what she would need and he said some of that was doable and some of it was beyond his budget and she wanted to say the word budget back to him like a mirror but she didn’t because this was not the time for jokes that make you feel taller in the moment and smaller an hour later. When she hung up she touched the toy through the lid of the box under the bed and told it, in case it was listening, that she was not going to let men with clipboards walk off with her usefulness and repack it into a bullet point. It was either brave or silly and she had decided she didn’t mind being both at once.

He was off for two classes with a text from the college that said Substitute Tutor: Mr. Lomas, and if the letters had lined up differently she might have shrugged and thought green beans for tea instead of peas. Mr. Lomas was a man with a head like a hinge and hands that moved like he’d done this before a thousand times without ever learning to enjoy it, and he said all the words as if they had been left on his tongue and he had to get rid of them before he could sleep. Naila rolled her eyes into the back of her head so far she might have read the last week on her skull and drew a piston having a crisis and slid it to Kath under the desk. Kath did the work because her hands knew how. She left both sessions with her jaw sore from not grinding and with a sudden, violent affection for the way Peter moved inside a sentence like someone who understood that words are tools and you should oil them.

On the second week of Lomas, the little figure in the box made a noise. It was not the little tinny speech that made the hair on her arms stand up because it came from the wrong place and had stolen a laugh; it was a tick-tick, tiny, like a mechanical watch. She put the box on the table in the kitchen and took the lid off and the figure sat same as always with its clipboard in its overambitious little hand, and she had a moment of wondering if she had imagined it or if the room had made a sound and she had given it to the toy because she was low on places to put strangeness. She closed the lid, and the tick came again, regular for a count of six and then gone. She lifted the figure and turned it over in her hand and the slot in the back was clean and empty and cool and her own breath smelled like tea and worry. She put it down with more care than the physics required, and that night she had one of the dreams where Peter is several people and none of them can take their tie off because their hands are in their pockets and the pockets are sewn shut.

Lomas finished his four hours of standing and the class made the noise you make when the last bit of a job gets done and the box is empty, and then the next week the email from the college said simply Peter back and her body did a thing she wished it didn’t do, the small gear engaged in the small gear that ran the bigger one. He walked in and the room stood up without meaning to and Naila breathed out like she’d been underwater and had decided to surface without telling anyone because nobody needed the drama. He looked the same and not; there was a fineness on him like the day after being sanded and sealed. He did his lines and none of them were new and yet the way he looked at the bench when he set the harness down had more human in it than she had any reason to expect. During the break he came over with his paper cup and stood near without being near and said, “Did Lomas talk at you like a man in a film from 1984 telling you to buy a microwave.”

“He did,” she said. “He was all right in the way of baked beans.”

“I shouldn’t be pleased,” he said. “But I am.”

The next morning someone had put a sticker on the locker room door at the college that said I AM A PERSON, and somebody else had drawn a moustache on it, and somebody else had stuck a small post-it under that said so am I, stop stealing my pens. She looked at the stack with her coffee and had the guilty conviction that a normal world was always going to fail to account for the parts of itself that had learned to survive the abnormal by making jokes. In the garage the man with the Fiat came in again not to fight but to hand over a box of biscuits because his sister had just had a baby and her name was on the paperwork in a square that made him feel like his life had admin, and she liked that he had folded joy into something like paying an invoice because it meant he didn’t have to go and shout at anyone in a shop to take the feeling out of his hands.

Spring turned up like someone had pushed a door and then realised they were early and let it swing back, and Leeds did that tender two-week thing where it remembered what green looks like. Kath bought a basil plant and felt ridiculous; the old woman downstairs knocked on her door for the first time in weeks to ask if she had change for a five and left with two pounds and a story about a grandson she may have made up. Peter sent her a photo of a bird on the rail of his window with the caption: mistake in a diagram, and she sent back a photo of the basil with the caption: food pretending to be an air freshener. They didn’t send more, they let the pictures sit and do work on the parts of them that had used up their capacity for tidy sentences.

Fenner stopped turning up in her day like a man who had learned her hours and started turning up like a weather system you could sense earlier in the week. She guessed at the pressure by the emails he sent and the way the class schedules changed; when he came he came in pairs or in smiles that never showed you the you he was holding in his head. He took Peter for a meeting for three hours on a Tuesday and a Polite Person filled in, and when Peter returned his voice had a slight slur on the edge that she recognised as the sound a person makes when they have been asked to explain themselves to someone who will only listen for what they can use. He stood and looked at the class and did not perform that noticing and she felt for the first time that she could see his effort. It made her love him like you love someone you watch lifting a thing they shouldn’t have to be lifting and will not put down because putting it down would change who they are.

She said yes to the offer because she had a feeling that if she said no again the offer would be rescinded with an offended efficiency that would teach her a lesson she didn’t want to learn. The yes came with a schedule and a stipend that would cover less than it needed to and an email that said, in a tone that believed itself to be the news: we are delighted to welcome you as an Associate Instructor. In a side clause it said you will be paired with P. Voss for observation and co-delivery, and she sat in the office chair and spun once and told Daz that if she started using the word deliver about anything other than parcels he had permission to spray her with brake cleaner. Marion said do it and also don’t be soft and also be soft, which was an impossible triad unless you were already doing two jobs with one pair of hands.

Her first session as a person with a lanyard was at nine on a wet Friday that made Leeds look like a different continent had been bolted on badly. The lanyard was plain, which she respected, and the badge said K. Benton, which made her smuggle a smile into the veneer of professionalism like a sandwich into a cinema. Peter did not change anything he did except he left a space at the start where he said, “This is Kath, she is here to make me better,” and the class laughed the right beat and then he went on. Co-delivery turned out to mean taking a part of the diagram and speaking about it until someone’s face relaxed and looked like understanding and then stopping and putting the tool down. She did it, and it felt like working on a car without the car but with the same reward, and when she said torque for the first time in that room the word was hers and not one she had borrowed. At the end, as the class filed out and Naila did the face at her that meant proud without admitting to it, Peter stood as if he had been told that this was a moment, and then he did nothing to it, because sometimes the right move is to not take a picture.

He sent her an email later that said You were a person, which was the compliment he had to give, and she wrote back I’m always a person and he wrote back Me never and she put the phone down and laughed because the small joke from that first day had a rope on it that reached all the way to now. The toy under the bed did its tiny tick again and she tapped the lid twice as if making an answer; it wasn’t an answer, it was an agreement that objects can have ritual even if they are simply plastic the colour of work.

They ate chips one evening on the steps by the river and it felt like a sin because he took three and then put the rest back like he was worried about leaving evidence. He told her about a boy in the morning class who had an instinct for listening with the screwdriver and an instinct for breaking his own sentences with laughter because he was embarrassed by how much he knew, and she told him about Marion staying late to do the banking and the way her lips moved as she counted and how counting her counted-ness had begun to feel like love. He said there was a new policy about ratios of practice to lecture and how that meant he was allowed to be more quiet, and she said that sometimes quiet is an act of sabotage if you do it in the right frame, and he looked at her like she had cut him a key for a door he hadn’t even seen yet. A gull hit the water like an argument and then stood on a piece of air it had negotiated with its own body and screamed at a duck for existing. They finished the chips and packed the paper and the salt and vinegar smell into the bin like a small secret.

The week the clocks went forward he was late for the first time. The class did what classes do, which is make a noise that is not complaint but something adjacent, the sound of people redistributing their patience. She started the board work and felt herself doing the way he did it because it was the easier way, and then corrected and did it the way she did it and it was not better but it was hers. When he arrived he had water on his shoulders and a look that was almost a look. He said sorry as if he was quoting someone else and launched into the sensible part, but when they took the break he leaned on the desk in the way that let his cuff ride up and she saw a small yellowing half-moon on the inside of his wrist. It was the colour of a bruise at the edge of giving up. She looked and he looked down and then he did a small thing she would have missed earlier in the year: he rotated his wrist deliberately so that she would know he knew she had seen and then rotated it back and went on. It was not much. It was the sort of generosity that costs a person a measurable amount of something. She wanted to call Fenner and drive the whole building into the river, which was not a plan, merely an impulse.

She told Naila in the launderette without names that there is a man you want to shake because he is trying so hard to do the right things with the wrong tools and the people who gave him the tools want the performance of trying more than the success of a new way, and Naila listened and ate a Danish and said, “We will go to his house and put the furniture wrong.” Kath laughed and sobered because she didn’t know where he went when he went, not precisely, which was both a kindness she had given him and a thing that rankled. “We will put all the mugs on the floor,” Naila went on, in a tone of deep wickedness, “and all the chairs on the table and take the lightbulbs out and the only way to fix it will be to care enough to go on fixing it forever,” and the woman folding sheets did an involuntary snort and pretended it was a cough and they were complicit.

The interview turned into a contract, the contract into a first payday that made no difference and an email with four acronyms Kath looked up in bed with her head under the duvet like a child reading past lights-out. She could do this; she could not be eaten. She hung the lanyard on the back of her kitchen chair the way you hang a scarf to tame it, and she put her coveralls over it like an elder sibling watching a wayward teenage friend. She told the toy under the bed that she hoped to never use the pack again because she wanted there to be a world where you didn’t have to trick numbers into letting people breathe.

The bad corridor made itself known in small ways over the next few weeks: a printed notice that said Remember: Calibration Is Care; a new lock on a door that had never needed one and that beeped if you looked at it like a door instead of like a permission machine; a smell of something chemical that tried to be lavender and ended up a metaphor for most attempts at kindness administered from a height. She saw Fenner once with a man she had not seen before, a man with soft shoes and a face that could have been melted and poured into a thousand other rooms, and they spoke in the grammatical tense of people who were deciding on the colour of a promise. Peter touched his cuff three times when they passed, and she didn’t know if he knew she had noticed and accepted that that not-knowing was part of their lovesick friendship.

On a Wednesday when the lesson was failing gracefully under the weight of a projector refusing to acknowledge the existence of any cable presented to it, Peter looked at the class and said, “Let’s do this with paper,” with a brightness that might have been a brand new setting and might have been the best kind of refusal. He set them to make looms of string and paperclips, to draw pins and paths with pens that left their wet licks on the cheap flipchart, to trace in crude thick lines the delicate maps that lived under bonnets. The room relaxed into the work like a jaw unclenching. He walked between the desks with his hands tucked in so that his ghost would not brush anyone, and when he reached Kath he didn’t look at her sheet because the room was watching him not look at her and he didn’t need to be in a column for this. He looked at her face and then at the paper and then at the room again, and she saw the small move of a person choosing to be perceived in a particular way to survive something. If that wasn’t love it was at least the rehearsal of it.

She found the pack again, not because it had come back—she still didn’t know where he had put it—but because she had a dream in which her thumbs found its shape in the pocket of a coat that wasn’t hers and when she woke her hands went to the place the dream had shown them and there was nothing, only the lining of a jacket that needed mending. The feeling it left behind was stronger than the object would have been, which she wrote down in the notebook she had started for odd little truths that didn’t belong to any system, right next to “open bolts with gratitude first, force second” and “some men tell a joke to stop themselves from apologising.” She took the notebook to the launderette and sat with it on her lap and the overalls doing their watery argument in the drum and wrote in it: If he is a made thing then he is like everything else I love; he is made by hands that don’t care the way I care and I will not hate the part of me that wants to care for him for free.

When the exam scores came back for real—not practice, not play—she saw her own number and allowed herself a small internal parade with a paper hat and three children on a float with wonky wheels. He said well done in a tone that wasn’t teacher-ish and she said cheers and in her head she added that she had done it in a room with his voice in it and it had made her brain noticeably cleverer. Naila got a worse mark than she wanted and came straight to the garage and sat on the bench with her palms up as if asking to be stamped. “Tell me I am still brilliant,” she demanded, and Kath put a hand over her mouth so she didn’t say the first thing and then she said the thing anyway, which was you are brilliant in the way that makes other people’s brilliance work. Naila cried with her mouth closed and Kath put a cup of tea where her hands had been, and the heater rattled, and Marion came in and said what’s happening in here then like a woman armed with a wrench and mercy both.

On a night when the wind got into the roof like a burglar, the toy under the bed shifted itself across the box so that it faced the corner where the skirting board didn’t quite meet the wall. It was such a small thing that any other year of her life would have condemned it to the bin of coincidence, and she sat on the floor and looked at it until her legs went pins and needles and then she lay on her back like someone who had fallen elegantly and watched the shadow move on the ceiling as passing cars shared their light. She told the toy out loud a story about her dad taking her to pick up a gearbox from a man who had a shed that was a cathedral and a dog that farted like a theological proof, and she made herself laugh enough at her own joke to make the edges of the room gentler.

If there was going to be a moment when they did something that they couldn’t untangle later, it wasn’t going to be at the end of a class or on a bridge where everybody walks past just as you decide to tell the truth. It happened, instead, in the bad corridor when the light failed in a way that the budget had accounted for and nobody else had, and the emergency fixture did its little kick and threw a disappointing quantity of greenish light over the lino. She had come for a box of spare pens because the marker had died in the middle of a diagram and she wanted to write the grounds in the colour that made sense rather than the one that was to hand, and he had come because she had texted him, and she hadn’t meant to text, but the absence of light made her grab for the closest thing that felt like a yes. They stood in the green like actors in a medical serial and she had to bite her tongue to keep from saying something about the colour of his face under that particular hue, because it made him stranger and that would have done something to her that the corridor didn’t have time for.

He didn’t touch her. He didn’t even make a move. He just looked at her and let the part of his face that usually belonged to the class fall off and reveal the rawer version underneath. “They took the pack out of the count,” he said, ordinary as tea, catastrophically gentle. “Fenner came and read a number out loud and nobody got in trouble. There was a joke about couriers. It will cost me later, not in pain but in a list of responsibilities shifted to my column, small additions, extra signatures. I can use that up on you if you want. On launderettes and steps. On the time it takes your eyes to change when you get a thought.”

“You can use nothing up on me,” she said, although she wanted the gift so much she could taste the metal of it under her tongue. “You can have me anyway. I’m not a unit. I don’t sit in a ledger.” She stepped forward in the space you can step forward when you have promised yourself not to touch and still sometimes need to be nearer. “If you want me, you can have me without owing me and without me owing their numbers.”

He did the thing with his mouth that would have been a kiss in a different room, in a different species, in a different contract with the people upstairs, and then the light clicked all the way on and they both stood there like two parts of a machine that had been accelerated without warning. He took a breath like a man who had received his face back, and she smiled with her teeth because that is sometimes what you do when you have just brushed past an edge and not fallen. He said, “Class,” and she said, “Pens,” and the way their bodies moved apart felt practiced because all good survival is.

On the steps that evening, when the sky had become the grey that belongs to a good pan and the river had stopped pretending to be anything but a river, they spoke about the long after as if it were a thing that could be pretended into existence. She said, “There will be a day when you don’t have to adjust your sleeve before you say anything and I will not have to pretend I’m not watching,” and he said, “There will be a day when I forget to say my first line and the roof does not fall in,” and they sat in the space where you can say things like that and not be punished by your own hope. A bus went by with an advert for a streaming service that promised small joys and huge emotions as if they could be purchased at the same price, and she thought, not for the first time, that the business of resisting wasn’t to stop yourself from crying; it was the insistence on crying when the thing had earned it.

She went to bed with her lanyard on the chair and her coveralls over it and the toy in its box not making any noise she could hear and woke at three, steady, steady running through her like an old comfortable virus. The radiator clicked its polite cough. On the street, someone laughed and then apologised as if to the air. She got up and stood at the window and put her hands on the cold of the glass because it was a place she could lay heat down and have it go somewhere. Somewhere across the city a man she loved without trying had a window too and a bird might be sitting on his rail, the mistake in the diagram correcting itself by repetition. She said, very softly, goodnight, to all of it, the launderette and the lemon corridor and the bad corridor and the blue tub with the plant on it and the man with the pack in his pocket and the man who had kept working under a Fiesta with his daughter holding the lamp badly. In the morning she would choose again, and the choice would not be lighter for being familiar, and she would make it anyway, because making it was how she had learned to live.
