The first time the town burned that winter it was mostly the smell of malt that came up with the smoke. Burton upon Trent always smelled like that, like roasted air and sugar and damp river, a scent that hugged the Washlands and clung in your hair. On the way to the callout, the engine rattling along the wet streets before dawn, Kira pressed her palm to the cold window and watched lit windows slide by as if they belonged to someone else's morning.

"Chip pan again. That time of year," Connor said, strapping his helmet chin strap tighter than necessary. He'd done that since autumn, since they'd lost the old boathouse to flood and fire and a domino line of bad luck. Ritual tightness.

"Or candles," Faye muttered, thumbing the pager even though it had stopped vibrating. "People think wax is tame. It isn't. Wax is bloody mean."

"Wax is just fat," said Gaz, grinning, already writing the first line of the incident in his head. He carried narratives like breathing apparatus; it made him feel prepared.

Kira checked her BA set with the old quickness that never felt old. Regulator test, gauge. A breath in that came back to her as a clean rattle. In summer she would sweat before they got there, right now she felt like a white stone. The wipers squealed. The town opened ahead of them, the river black as rust.

They pulled up to the terrace where the smoke crawled out along the eaves like the exhaust of a bad dream. Watch Commander Naylor flicked his light at the door and they were in: Gaz with the jet, Connor on entry. Kira took the right, heat pricking the skin near her eyes.

The hallway had that saturated heat of a thousand kettle boils. Someone had tried with a damp towel thrown over the pan; someone had screamed and left it. Kira saw the shadow of a crucifix on the wall fade under the smoke and thought, not for the first time, that faith was probably an okay thing, in moderation.

"Is anyone inside?" Faye shouted, and a woman in a dressing gown cried, "My boy, my boy, Ben, he...," pushing forward till Naylor held her shoulders with his big hands like she was both younger and older than she looked.

"We're in," Kira called, and she and Connor took the kitchen door at once, shouldering into the breathing fog. The pan licked flames like a slow dancer. The table had wilted. Connor covered and Kira found the boy—he wasn't a boy; he was twenty if he was a day—on the floor near the back door, coughing the paper out of his lungs. She wanted to be angry with him but mostly she wanted him to breathe, and she managed to get his arm slung over her and lift as Connor kept the flames from crawling up the wall near the boiler.

They had him outside in eight seconds or eighty; it was later, when the woman folded her son's head into her chest and thanked God and Kira in the same sentence, that Kira let herself notice that her knees were shaking hard enough that if she had been a bell there would have been music.

"Take a breath, Kir," Faye said softly, unhooking her mask. "One for now. We'll do the rest inside."

The morning took a long time to arrive after that. They rode back through the raw drizzle listening to Radio Derby talk about something that wasn’t their morning at all. In the station, Gaz made coffee that tasted like he thought coffee should taste—heroic and grim—and Kira found her phone in her locker and stared at the schedule she’d pinned there. Evening: Fire Investigation—Module 2, nineteen hundred hours. She pinched the bridge of her nose to chase a headache out. It didn't go; headaches were stubborn that way.

"You’re still doing that course?" Connor asked, slouching with his mug like a Sunday painting.

"Someone has to keep you lot honest," she said. "And I like it. It’s... there’s something neat about seeing the end and following it backwards until you find the match."

"Ha. It's because you like puzzles."

She did. She liked taking heat’s chaos and finding its syntax. And she liked using her brain until it hummed. She didn't say any of that out loud. Instead she leaned her head back so it touched the cool metal of the locker and let her muscles furl. The sound of the washers spinning out sodden tunics in the back hall was a kind of lullaby if you were tired enough. Today she was tired enough.

"You coming to Coopers Friday?" Faye asked, sitting beside her and nudging Kira’s boot with her own. "Gaz'll buy the first round to make up for his coffee pretending to be coffee."

"I can't. Next Friday. My dad’s birthday. Fortnightly curry and telling me I should move to Loughborough because the trains are better."

"Tell him the trains are haunted," Gaz said. "He'll be impressed."

They laughed, and then the laughter ran out, and the station went back to its low click and hum. Outside, the river gave back the sky.

By late afternoon the town's ordinary cold had crept up her sleeves and made itself a tenant. She cycled to the college because the sky was almost clear and she needed air that didn't taste like other people's houses. Burton College had added a new building since she’d last been on campus as an actual eighteen-year-old; the new one was all green glass and optimism, the old one was brick and the smell of carpet glue that dated back to the seventies. Her class was on the third floor of the old wing, down a corridor that had posters about safety pinned up with blu tack and valiantly curling at the corners.

She was early. She liked being early; it was like arriving at a place in time to see it decide what it wanted to be. The classroom lights hummed, half of them lit, the rest sensible enough to remain unlit until someone walked under them. Kira sat in the second row—she’d promised herself she’d sit in the first this time, but the second row had become a habit—and set her notebook on the little desk that wanted to be futuristic and was only a small plank on a pivot.

Students trickled in. A Housing Officer with nails perfect as petals. A serious lad from Tutbury who wore his high vis jacket like armour even when he wasn't on site. A woman whose hair was silver and cut blunt and perfect; she spoke to no one and then took out a pencil from a case that had an owl on it. Kira loved them for their ordinary oddness. You'd think after so many late nights at stations you'd be inured to people, but she liked them more, if anything, for being here, for wanting to learn how to find where fire breathed first.

He came in with the course pack under his arm and that crisp posture that reads as authority even at a distance. There had been an email in September about the regular lead taking sick, about the new instructor having done consultancy work in Leeds and Milton Keynes and Doha, for heaven's sake. His name was on the slide as if the slide and he had agreed in advance: Elias Vale.

"Evening," he said, with that unfussy Midlands voice that made his name make more sense than Doha did. "Thank you for braving the weather. We’re going to talk origin points tonight, and we’re going to talk about lies."

A few people glanced at each other. He smiled, as if he liked that they were uncertain. The smile was... neat. Symmetrical, the way a logo is.

"The thing about fire," he went on, setting the course pack down and clicking the projector on with his finger, "is it tells the truth it wants to tell. And the thing about people is they do the same. If you can see the grammar in the way heat eats a door, you can see the grammar in the way someone hides a petrol can. There’s no such thing as an accident that looks like an accident. You’ll learn to love the geometry of it. Or you’ll hate me and go back to reading meters for a living. Both are fair."

"Bit romantic, isn't it," the lad from Tutbury said under his breath, not quite under his breath. Elias angled his head towards him and the movement was precise enough to be choreography. It wasn't unkind.

"I suppose it is," he said. "Romance is a kind of precision too. Right," and he picked up a piece of chalk as if it were the instrument he always chose to perform with. He wrote triangles on the board, clean and proportional and so straight that Kira felt her fingers itch with the urge to touch the chalk lines to prove they were real.

He did not pace; he turned, rather, on an axis, always facing them, a lighthouse of attention. His hands were long and his shirt cuffs were an exacting white. Now and then he paused before speaking the next sentence as if he were receiving the sentence from someone else, and then he said it in a way that made it sound like it had been waiting for them to ask it for a long time.

Kira leaned forward with her pen and tried not to watch his mouth. That wasn't usual for her. She didn't fall for mouths. She fell, if she fell, for hands, for shoulders, for the way someone slept on their palms in the afternoon. But the way he said arc pattern, the way he said flashover, the way the words sat in his jaw, she could imagine writing them down her own forearms so she wouldn't forget.

In the break he arranged the course packs into a little spiral that would make sense to no one but him, and Kira stood up and then sat down again because her knees seemed suddenly not to be under instructions. The silver-haired woman approached him to ask a question about heat signatures. He listened with his head tipped as if that let him hear the better, then answered with a sentence that had a bubble of humour in it. When he laughed, Kira thought briefly and inconveniently of ice cracking on a winter river and then melting.

He did not drink the tea that the Housing Officer politely made for him, though he wrapped his hands around the mug like it was necessary to be seen holding warmth. At the end of the class, he clicked off the projector and stood for a moment in the near-dark as if he wasn't quite sure where to go next. Then he smiled again and said, "Next week we'll look at plaster and memory. Don't be late, or I'll make you read about insurance until you cry."

"Cheerful," the Tutbury lad said, but he was grinning by then. People had turned their faces outwards like sunflowers. Kira shoved her notebook into her canvas bag as if it were an apology, and before she had time to change her mind she walked up to him.

"You made it sound like a poem," she said, too quickly, and then winced because that was the sort of thing people said when they were trying to be clever and she didn't want to be clever, she wanted to be honest or at least tidy.

"A poem?" he asked, and there were tiny grooves at the edge of his mouth like he didn't quite know how to age.

"I mean. The geometry. Of... heat. Sorry. I'm Kira."

"I know," he said. "You put your name on your notebook and underlined it twice. And you answered the question about trailer patterns. Which was the hardest one."

"I work with water for a living," she said, and then felt absurd. "Fire and water. All that. That was embarrassing."

"It's fine," he said. "I live in lists." And then he made a face like he'd said too much. "Sorry. I'm—well. You know that too. Elias. It’s nice to meet you... and your poems."

There was a bowl of sweets on the desk that hadn't been there at the start of the class. He pushed it towards her in a careful motion. Caramels. The wrappers made that soft crackle like leaves.

She took one. Felt that if their fingers touched she would turn into something combustible. They did not touch. His nails were pale and smooth, as if he had thought too long about them.

"Do you teach all the modules?" she asked.

"I teach some. I learn some. That's my trick. I'm filling in. Maybe longer if the world doesn't tilt under me."

"The world is always tilting," she said, because that was true and because she didn't want him to tell her how long he would be here in case it was a small number and she wanted to pretend it was big.

He tilted his head. There it was again, that motion. A machine remembering ballet.

"Is it?" he asked. "Then we better learn to stand."

Outside the college the air was black ice. She rode her bike with her fingers numb and her thoughts too wordy. The river sighed, and in the distance the breweries breathed beer smell into the sky and it felt ridiculous and right that a whole town could smell like drink. She cut through the Washlands, because there was a path and because there was a section where river birds made little sudden noises in the reeds and she could eavesdrop. Her head should have been full of fire dynamics, of scorch marks and ignition temperatures, but it wasn't. It was full of his voice and that was inconvenient. She was thirty-two and a grown up and she didn’t fall in love with teachers in classrooms like some spiky seventeen-year-old with biro lyrics on her forearms. Except maybe she did.

At home her flat was a series of rectangles. She had never been much for collecting stuff, and the walls were more white than personality. There were photographs shoved into a line on the mantel, but none of them had frames. The people in them were grinning unfinished grins. Her dad at the seaside holding a Cornetto like a trophy. Her mum with a bad perm laughing so hard her eyes were closed, and no one taking the photo because her mum had always found a way to make others do the important little things. She sat on the floor in the kitchen and ate beans out of a pan because she couldn't be bothered to turn on the telly or find a plate, and she hummed a stupid song about triangles until she realised it was not about triangles and was about him.

She could live like this for a while, she thought. Working, breathing, studying, thinking. Wanting. Not asking. Content to keep her longing folded up like a spare jumper in a drawer, to take out in quiet hours and hold close for a minute and then put away again. Nothing had to happen. She could be her own good story.

The next morning there was frost on the grass like someone had painted crop circles with sugar. She ran along the river with her breath visible, her legs reliable, her headphones a white cord that made her look like someone out of a different decade. The news on the radio in the kitchen while she showered said something vague and toneless about deployment. The word was white and rubbery; it bounced. She thought of it as a toy you give a child to chew on and hoped that was true, that it didn't mean anything, that it would be the sort of story that slid away behind other ones, weather, the Premier League.

Back at the station there was a visit from a primary school. Kira always liked those mornings, the way the kids took catastrophe and dressed it up and made it friendly. She got to show them how the BA mask went on, how it made your voice sound like Darth Vader, and one little boy said, solemn as a bishop, "Are you not scared?" and she said, "All the time," in the cheeriest voice she could manage, and then, softer, "But I go anyway. That’s the job. Sometimes your legs do the brave bit before your head does."

"Do you get to hold the hose?" a girl with plaits asked, eyes sharp. Kira grinned and said, "Yes. And the hose gets to hold you," and the watch room smelled of wet wool and crayons and the faint electric scent of printing ink from the visits leaflets and that smell made her absurdly content.

When the day slowed, when paperwork turned everything into numbers and then into boxes, she pulled up the reading list Elias had sent by email. He had written the email like someone writing a letter to a person in a place where the weather might be difficult but the sky would clear eventually. He used punctuation properly. He thanked them too many times. At the end he'd added, almost as an afterthought: If you need me, leave my name on the board. I look for it.

"He's posh," Faye said, peering over Kira's shoulder when Kira wasn't ready for anyone to see. "Only posh men write you proper letters and tell you to leave their names on boards. Is he pretty?"

"I don't know what probably," Kira said, and felt her cheeks heat. She could fight fires and run up three flights of stairs in fifty pounds of kit and she refused to be embarrassed by this. She was. Human bodies were inconvenient like that.

"You do," Faye said, kindness wrapped in teasing. "You can tell me you don't. It's fine. Just don't make me drink Gaz’s coffee again for nothing."

"It's a class. He's a good teacher." Kira used her practical voice, the one you used for knot-tying, for instructions on how to make a house not die. "And it's not like— I'm not. It's not."

"Mm," Faye said. "I would never say it is. Will you bring me some of that knowledge in a doggy bag? I'm wasting away."

Kira laughed, grateful for the pivot. The day went on. The sky lost its colour. At six-thirty she found herself in the college hallway again, on the same floor, as if the carpet had moved under her feet and swapped her right back. Tonight the lights were a little dimmer, the air a little warmer. Her palms were damp. It made her cross with herself. She flexed her fingers and told them to quit.

He was already there, writing on the board with that same precise care, the chalk barely making a whisper. There was a cut on his cheek. No, not a cut exactly, a straight line like he shaved directly on his face with a ruler. He had a tie that was exactly the colour of a bruise. He was reading when they came in, and Kira had the ridiculous sensation that he read with his peripheral vision, that he could see the room without turning his head.

"Evening," he said, so gently that the room quieted without being told to. "We'll start with something that looks like a story. All origin points are stories. Who set this scene?"

He projected a photograph onto the board. A living room, ordinary, ugly carpet. A low coffee table. A chair too close to a plug. A scorch pattern like a flower. Kira leaned forward like she could enter the picture through force of will. He watched them watch it. He was good at silence. He was good at making silence feel like a tool rather than a deficit. Kira used to think that was what leaders did; now she thought maybe it was what teachers did instead.

"Three answers," he said after a while. The Housing Officer raised a hand. The silver-haired woman did not. The lad from Tutbury said "My uncle," and everyone laughed and then didn’t.

"Good," he said, and made a small notation on his page. "And good. And I have one more. The one I think is true. But I have a habit of repeating myself, so you can tell me if I'm merely fond of myths."

It went on like that, a well-made machine, a cheerful lecture disguised as a conversation. When Kira answered a question, his eyes landed on her with the weight of a hand, and she had the sense that he could see her throat move when she swallowed. She remembered her mother saying once, "He looks at you like you’re a real person," and had laughed because she had been nineteen and cruel to the safe. Now she understood that sentence as if it were a lock opening.

After the session, Kira lingered near the doorway like a person considering the weather. She wasn’t going to say anything, she promised herself. She had said enough. He moved like an algorithm that let itself be human for seconds at a time. He packed his bag. Then he stopped, shoulders set at a neat angle, and turned.

"Do you have a second?" he asked, and it was her turn to be arranged by someone else’s sentence. "You... there's a case study. It involves a... local. Someone mentioned that you were Burton station? I wondered if you’d seen it. If you have... if you'd be willing to talk it through. No pressure. It's messy."

"Messy is cheerful," she said, somewhere between sincerity and panic. "Yes. Sure. Of course. Which case?"

He said the name, and it drop-kicked her memory so hard she could taste the dust. A small house near Horninglow. An old man and candles. It had kept her awake, not because of guilt but because of the way the floor had made a noise like sighing when the water hit it.

She nodded. Her hands were suddenly empty. He gestured to the desk, an invitation that looked like a line drawn on the floor, and she went there and her bones felt slightly too light.

He took out photographs. He set them down one by one with perfect bleak care. He didn’t touch them with the pads of his fingers. He used the sides. How had she not noticed that before? It seemed suddenly rude to be looking at him like this, to be cataloguing him in her head, the way she’d learned to catalogue rooms. Stiffness, precision, symmetry. He smelled clean—the way a cupboard smells if it has been empty for a long time and someone suddenly puts a sweater in it.

"I don’t want to intrude," he said, and then laughed at the sentence as if it had agreed to be funny. "You can tell me to go away."

"It’s all right," she said. "He was... he was ninety-two. He told everyone he was ninety-six. That was the least of it."

They spoke like that for a small, entire time. He asked her a question about the pattern near the door; she answered; he listened as if he were learning a new language from her throat. He didn’t waste her. Kira liked that more than she liked most things.

When she looked up at last she realised the corridor lights outside had gone to their half-lit night mode. There was no one else in the building. The air had that hollow sound buildings have when they think they are alone. Elias was looking at her with a kind of intent that would have made her skin itch if she were anyone else.

"You run," he said, out of nowhere.

"I do," she said, and laughed. "Is it written on me somewhere?"

"You move like someone who knows where your feet will go," he said. "Most people don't."

It was such a peculiar compliment that she took it and put it in the pocket of her mind for later. "And you," she ventured. "You stand very still. It's... I mean. You make people feel like something important is happening."

He laughed softly. The sound was a notch lower than his speaking voice. "Occupational hazard," he said. "Thank you. I was... built for it."

The word snapped into the air and then lay very neatly on the desk between them, and she either didn't see it or saw it and filed it with other things for later. She reached for the photograph of the Horninglow house and their hands nearly touched. The skin between his thumb and forefinger looked almost too smooth, like a peach with the fuzz wrong.

"You've got a line," she said, before she could stop herself. "Sorry. On your cheek. That sounded—" It sounded like flirtation. She hadn't meant it to be. It was and it wasn't.

He raised his hand and touched his cheek with the same care he took with everything. "Oh. Yes," he said, as if he'd forgotten. "I'm always... being assembled."

She didn’t know what to do with that. He looked at her and then past her at the window where their own reflections hovered like ghosts waiting to be given something to do. The lights hummed two tones; one high, one lower. The hum and the hum.

"Are you all right?" she asked, and then wanted to roll the question back up and swallow it. Ridiculous. Why would she ask. He was fine. He was two metres of fine.

He looked at her as if she were a door he understood. "Yes," he said. "I am composed. That's my trick." And then, as if he'd been taught this part in a different class, "You?"

"Me? Yes," she said. "Partly. Mostly. Today."

He smiled at that. They stood. He moved in that exact way again. If it had been anyone else she might have thought he had a bad back. With him it was choreography. She imagined him putting himself away at the end of the day the way you put away cutlery, the forks separated from the spoons.

She walked out into the night with a sense that she had forgotten to pick up something important. At the bike racks there was a fox with one ear chewed ragged, and it looked at her like she owed it money, and then wandered away into the shrubs as if it had decided not to fight her for it.

On the ride home the lights in the houses were soft squares. She imagined what people might be eating. Curry, toast, soup. She imagined Elias’s kitchen and then realised she couldn’t; she couldn’t populate it with anything. It was an empty stage. The thought made her shiver the way the cold hadn’t.

The next days slid. Drills. Salvage. A night where they went out to a barn near Needwood and held white hoses in moonlight and it felt like a scene from a war film. That word again, creeping in where it had no right to be. The news got louder, as if it had been turned up a notch. Experts talked with their hands in ways that made Kira want to mimic them and then slam them back down on the table. People said "situation" like it was a disease. Faye shook her head at the radio and said, "They'll find a way to send the wrong people there."

"Who is the right person," Gaz asked with that yearning that made Kira want to open him up and put something soft round his heart. Not to keep it from breaking, but to let it break more gently.

By the third week of the course, Kira had stopped pretending she wasn't going for reasons other than learning. She got to the classroom early and watched the stairwell like someone whose lift was stuck between floors. Elias arrived and smiled that symmetrical smile, and they did their lesson about blistering and wood and the smell of foam. His shirts were always white. He never seemed to spill. He never drank, though the mugs kept appearing, the Housing Officer being kind in the ways that she knew and was sure would eventually matter to someone.

After class, he said, with no prelude, "Would you like to get coffee with me somewhere that isn't this room?" and it was the clumsiest sentence and the most precise. It made her want to sit down.

"Yes," she heard herself say before anything else in her life had asked for permission. "There's a place near the river. It's weird. You'll like it."

"The weird bit sells it," he said, putting papers into his bag with that care and then straightening the strap with a little gesture that she now recognised as habit, as something he did when he needed to reset his face.

They walked out into Burton together. The air was a sliver. The streetlights turned everything the colour of old tea. The coffee place by the river was barely a place at all, more of a room someone had decided to let other people into. There were three tables. There was a dog asleep under the counter with a name tag that said Nigel.

"Is this Nigel?" Elias asked, distantly delighted.

"This is Nigel," Kira said. "He looks after the espresso machine."

They sat and the barista, a girl with hair dyed a careful blue, asked what they wanted and they both said "Americano," in the same voice, and then laughed because that was a nice way the world got to be silly. Elias held the warm cup and didn't drink and it should have been sinister, the way he didn't, but it wasn't. It was just a fact that sat and waited to be named.

"Why fire?" he asked.

Kira picked a sugar packet up and folded it and unfolded it. "My mother," she said. "She used to say when the kettle boiled it was the house talking. When the sauce caught in the pan she called it swearing. I liked the way heat made a language you could interpret. And then... a flat on the estate burned when I was thirteen. No one died. Two cats did. I thought: if I had been there I could have translated fast enough to make the stupid thing speak a different sentence. That doesn't make sense. It made sense then."

"It makes sense," he said, simply. "And you're good at it. You use your... I was going to say hands, which would be indecent. Your head. You use your head and then your hands catch up."

He looked different here, out of the lecture theatre. Not softer, exactly. The edges of him more obvious. He laughed when she said something about being terrified of gas meters. He tried to drink his coffee and then put it down. She wanted to ask but she did not. There were rules about not interrogating people you gradually liked too much.

"Why teaching?" she asked, in the way you ask someone why they have a scar.

He considered. He did that pause, the one that felt like latency, and then his mouth curved in that measured way.

"I wasn't built for anything else," he said. "Not really."

"You keep saying that. Built." She said it as a joke. She did.

He smiled. "Occupational hazard," he repeated. "Sorry. It's a way of talking. We all have them. You have... stairs. You climb words."

They walked along the river afterwards. The Washlands were soggy and the sky was iron. He walked with perfect balance. Kira wanted to reach out and disturb it, to put a finger on his sleeve and watch what happened. She did not. They stopped on the little bridge where duckweed made a green continent. He looked at the water like he was laying it out carefully in his head.

"My mother would have liked you," she said, without knowing she was going to. "She liked anyone who made order. She hated order herself. But she loved anyone who could pretend."

"And your father?"

"He wants me near trains," she said. "He's a timetable man. He thinks if you put everything down in little boxes nothing bad sneaks in. As if everything bad doesn't own a key."

"And you?" he said. "What do you want?"

He looked at her, not into her, not through. At. She could have done a catalogue of that gaze. She wanted to say the thing you can never say, which is: you. She said, "To be present when necessary, and absent when not. To know which is which."

He nodded as if this were a real answer. She loved him for that, in the small way you love people long before you have any right. The river sucked at its banks. Somewhere farther along, a dog barked as if to remind people of the names of things.

The news turned up another degree the following week, and then a little more, and then it was a boil you could touch. There were numbers and maps and a thin headline font that didn’t change but felt like it did. People said the word war and then rearranged their faces afterwards. The college put notices up about contingency plans and "pastoral support." The fire station got a message about mutual aid and being ready to be ready.

Elias began a class by saying, "We may have interruptions. If I disappear that doesn't mean anything except that it does, I suppose." People tittered and didn't. He was paler that night. Or she imagined he was. There was a pallor to him that was not quite human pallor, a kind of uniform shade. Like paint.

At the end of the hour he was arranging the chalk again in its little citadel. Kira stood near the door because she had grown too fond of that place to leave it. "Do you ...," she started, then changed her mind three times. "If you need...," she began again, feeling foolish. "If the class needs anything. If you have to go. I can—"

"I know how to move away," he said, with that gentleness that felt like a hand on the back of her neck. "Thank you. We'll keep talking. If not... leave my name on the board."

"Is that a thing?" she asked. "Do names work that way?"

"They do if enough people say them," he said. He looked like he had come from a box. She thought: that’s a mean thought. Don't think mean. But it was there, that little click of mind on a smooth surface.

The building emptied around them, or it didn't, and the world tilted, or it didn't. She went home and lay on her living room floor and listened to the upstairs neighbour practice piano and it was hopeless and perfect because the upstairs neighbour wasn't very good and the notes stumbled and then found their way and then fell over again, and in the middle of it all, the river, the fire station, her own body, all of it sounded like someone trying very hard to finish a sentence and not knowing yet which verb belonged.

She dreamed that night of doors that opened on other doors, and of a man made of pale wood with a beautiful white shirt standing still enough for corridors to open around him, and she woke with that deep underwater ache in her chest that said: you're in trouble, and you won't save yourself with a hose. She got up and made toast and the kettle breathed and she told herself, out loud, that she had work and that was enough. Sometimes truth is a version of something. Sometimes it's not.

The Thursday after that class, after a day where nothing bled and everything insisted on having paper attached to it, she got the email. It came at ten at night when she was sitting on the rug trying to map a scene from a case study with bits of string and tape like a ridiculous detective in a film. The subject line was, without drama: notice. She clicked.

Kira,

I will be away for a while. The college will send their own message, probably with bold font. I wanted to send this first so that the words might land quietly rather than being shouted at you with "Dear all."

If we had time I'd explain. We don't. Or I don't. This is a method that seems to recur in my life—sudden vanishing. I'm on loan to something which is not a good sentence, but will do. Teach them what you know. You have more of it than you think.

If you walk by the room and it is empty, leave my name on the board. It will give me a place to come back to.

E.

She read it twice. The room had its own hum. It has always been there. She stood up and went to the sink as if water had new instructions for her. She filled a glass. She didn't drink it. She took it with her to the windowsill and pressed it against the peeling paint and felt cold. She wanted to write back. She didn't know what an appropriate number of words was for this departure. She typed, deleted, typed, deleted, and then left the draft sitting there like a person waiting for a bus that might not come.

Her phone buzzed; Faye: pub Friday? I need to forgive Gaz for something. Kira typed: might be late, and then added, inexplicably, Do you know anything about the college sending people to war. Backspacing looked like gulls.

The college email came an hour later, with all the careful generic phrases piled on top of each other like blankets. Due to circumstances beyond. Hardship. Temporary. Continuity. And then there it was anyway, at the end: secondment to support training for allied operations. They’d sent their teacher away, the bold font said, to help with a war that had been turning up the volume in the corner of the room like a bored child for a month.

She walked to the college the next day even though she had no class. She had coffee in a cardboard cup and it tasted like instructions. The corridor was full of cleaners swiftly and kindly ignoring her. She went into the classroom and the board was too clean. She picked up a piece of chalk and felt stupid and un-stupid in the same breath. She wrote, very small and square, ELIAS VALE, and underlined it once.

The chalk squeaked like a tiny thing trying to sing. The squeak sounded a little like the pause he made before speaking. She put the chalk down. She waited. The room waited with her, empty and full. She hated that hope made your body its house.

Her phone vibrated, as if hilarity were still allowed: Gaz, with a picture of him in a paper crown in the station kitchen, captioned: morale operations. She laughed out loud. She wrote back: you need a better tie, and tucked the phone into her pocket as if she had put sadness away for some later time.

On the way out she saw, through the glass panel of the staff room door, an object that made her stop and stare as if she’d seen a fox in daylight. On the table, slumped in the way bloodless things slump, was a torso. That was ridiculous; that was wrong. It was one of the medical training mannequins the college used for paramedic modules, skin the pink of a default lipstick, mouth a neat O. Next to it was an arm, and the arm had the most perfect nails, pale, smooth, like someone had thought hard about them. There was a tie on the chair. It was the colour of bruises.

She laughed at herself, one dry sound. She stood there and looked, and told herself the world made more sense than her mind sometimes did. It was a college. There were mannequins. There were arms. She walked away.

Later, in the station kitchen, Faye watched her butter toast and said, "You’re somewhere else."

"Maybe," Kira said. "Maybe I'm in Doha."

"Bring me back dates."

"Skinned knees," Kira said. "And something sharp for your hair."

She dreamt that night of chalk lines on a board, of the way his body didn't quite get in the way of things, of the way emptiness knocked, gently. She woke before the knocking had finished, the kind of half-salty taste of unslept thoughts in her mouth, and counted backwards from a hundred in odd numbers because that's what her mum used to make her do when the world turned itself up too loud. Ninety-nine, ninety-seven, ninety-five, all the way down to one.

When she went to the class the week after, an older man stood at the front with a tie patterned with tiny boats and a way with anecdotes that made them all like him anyway. He had breath. He drank water, greedily. Kira watched the board until it was something she could stand to look at. Her own handwriting had got bigger over the last month, as if she were trying to take up space to prove she'd been there. The Washinglands were brown and cold. The breweries hummed. People kissed outside Coopers in coats thick enough to be houses. The world tilted, yes, but everyone walked along it as if it had always been at an angle.

She kept going for runs that were too long and not long enough. She took calls that were small and one that wasn't, a warehouse in Swadlincote where everything smelled like candles again and the night made steam above people’s mouths and Kira held the hose until her arms shook and then held it some more because that's what you did, you held the thing that pulled you and you pulled back.

Sometimes she wrote his name on the back of receipts while she waited for the wash to end. Sometimes she biked to the college and stood in the corridor like someone waiting for a rehearsal to end. Twice she went into the room and wrote ELIAS VALE on the board and stood there for an embarrassed minute and then left, wiping it off with her fingers, the chalk dust a ghost on her skin.

A month passed in that stretched way January has. The news made room in itself for weather and then shoved the weather out again to put in the men with maps and the women with voices too calm, too iron. She stopped saying his name out loud. Sometimes even in her head it felt like a small ritual that could go wrong.

And then one afternoon, when the river was all light, when a boy on a bicycle nearly ran straight into her and swung away at the last possible moment with an apology that sounded like laughter, she saw him. Or she saw what she thought was him. Or she saw a man about his height and his colour and his stillness standing near the bulletin boards at the college, and her whole body did that inside-out thing blood does when it is surprised. She walked very calmly up the stairs. She walked very calmly down the corridor. She could hear her own steps, so loud in the hush they kept here, and she thought: This is undignified. And: I will be dignified later.

He stood with his hands at his sides, which was not how people stand when they are alone. He turned with that same precise axis. He smiled that symmetrical smile. The line on his cheek was a little longer. If she had been a different person she would have reached out to touch it, like you do with a hot pan to teach yourself something.

"Hello," he said. "I came back the way you asked."

"I didn't ask," she said, and smiled even though she hadn't planned to. "I wrote your name on the board. That's not the same as asking. That's an incantation."

"It works in much the same way," he said, and there was something in his voice like static. She wanted to say his name. She didn't. She said, "Do you want coffee. Nigel misses you a terrible amount."

"I can't stay long," he said, the apology of someone who wasn't sure if apologies were furniture. "But yes. Yes, all the same."

They walked. The river looked like glass that someone had breathed on once, years ago, and then waited for it to clear. They sat at their table. Nigel was on duty and snored a little. The blue-haired girl had gone brown-haired and wore a hat. They ordered, in the same voice again without trying to, and she watched as he took the cup and held it and didn't drink.

"You were—" she began. "Was it awful?"

"It was," he said. "And not. It was numbers in uniforms. It was dry. There were things I am not suited for. I found ways to stand. That bit I'm good at."

She breathed. The whistle in her chest that countless stairs had built quieted. "Good," she said. It wasn't enough. It was what she had.

He looked at her with the kind of concentration that made the coffee place around them fuzz a little. "I taught five people how to put hands where blood can’t get out. I taught three how to name heat by skin alone. I stood very still while someone shouted. Such use as I could be put to, I was."

"I missed you," she said, as if she were reading a gauge and just reporting the number. There were rules. She could obey some and ruin others.

His hand moved as if to reach across the small space between them and then stopped like a machine returning to default. There was the smallest click. She might have imagined it. She wouldn't know until later that she hadn't.

"I thought of you," he said. "When I needed a sentence that would be warmer than the sentence in front of me."

They drank nothing. They sat with their coffee. They said ordinary things until the ordinary softened the sharp. He left at last with a small duck of his head, like a man leaving a stage who is grateful to the stage for having held him. She sat long enough that the blue-haired girl had to wipe their table twice to get past her. On the way out she saw again the staff room door and glanced in without meaning to. The torso was gone. The arm was gone. On the table was a box, white card, tied with string.

People have to go away to do the things they are asked to do. Sometimes they come back. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they come back and their edges are different. Sometimes they teach you the word for how the black on a wall tells you about light and you think: I could love you, if I wanted. And sometimes it is too late for the if, and there you are.

That night, asleep at last, she dreamed a dream she wouldn't remember later except as weight. In it the river was a corridor and the corridor had doors and the doors had chalk names and she opened one and there he was and he was smiling and he was not. In the dream she could hear a radio a long way off, and the voice on it was saying: be advised, be advised, be advised. And the voice went on like that, as the world turned and all the people in it pretended to be brave.The thaw began not with warmth but with sound. The Washlands leaked little noises the way a sleeping person turns in the night, small sloshes as the frost let go of the grass and ran off in thin streams, and the breweries exhaled a little deeper so the malt smell sat heavier on tongues. Kira woke to gulls elbowing the sky and the on-off hiss of tyres moving through wet, and for a second before names reassembled themselves she lay very still and tried to decide if her heart had gone faster in sleep or if it had been like this, this steady quickness, all along. The kettle clicked. She watched the steam billow and flatten and made a silly promise to be simple today. Simplicity was exhausting and never lasted until lunch.

At the station they had a quiet callout to a shed made of opinions and old paint tins, and then a not-quiet one to a row of garages where someone had been generous with accelerant and then surprised themselves; the flames had done that lizard thing on the ceiling, quick zips of light Kira could not help but admire even as she swore at them. By the time they had the rolling shutter forced up and the jet in, there was a hum in the steel that lived in the wrists for hours after. She knelt in the wet oil as if it were faith and studied the pattern lick its way up the block wall, that neat inverted V that was never as child's-picture simple as people thought. When the FI van arrived, grey and unexciting as a shoebox, Hawley got out with his clipboard and his honest boots and nodded at Kira the way a man nods when he knows your handwriting. She went over what they'd seen; he went over what he wanted to think; between them something like truth offered them a seat. Later, back at the sink, washing the stink out of her fingers, she wondered if it was new that people had to make a living lying to buildings and then convincing themselves they had been misunderstood.

On Thursday night she took the train to Loughborough with a folded party hat forgotten in her coat pocket and the sensation of having left the oven on even though she had no oven on. The carriage lights gave everyone submarine skin. She stood because sitting felt like admitting to something, and she watched her reflection slung across the dark outside, her face pasted on a country that hadn't signed up to host it. Her dad walked the station platform like it was a timetable he could make behave. He kissed the top of her head and then looked at her like he was checking her out of lost property.

"You're thin," he said, fond and complaining at once, in his Erewash way that made vowels into scruples. "They not feeding you down there?"

"They feed me heroism and crisps," she said. "Happy birthday."

They had curry at a place he liked because the waiter remembered him and because the music was always two songs behind what the radio insisted on, which her father said was the civilised way to be. They talked in that conjoined way you do when you each know where the other’s gaps are. He told her about Mrs Perry from number four who had finally swapped her hanging baskets for window boxes and looked five years younger, and about the man at the bookies who had been caught cheating not with cards but with folded corners on a calendar no one but him knew he could read that way. She told him about drills and a boy who had asked her at a school visit if fire had a favourite colour and how she had stopped herself answering "black" and said "orange" instead because sometimes kindness is just accuracy put on a leash.

When the conversation got to the part where he asked, very mildly, as if the question were a plate he was balancing on the palms of his hands, if she was seeing anyone, she almost said "a man who doesn't drink coffee and moves like a lighthouse" and then laughed because the sentence would sound like a dare. She said, "I like someone who teaches me about burn patterns," which was not a proper answer but true enough to keep the air in the room sweet.

"Proper person?" he asked, his eyes set to Dad Tolerant, the dial he'd had since she was five and wanted a pet sheep. "Not some one-week wonder with a guitar and a philosophy about kettles?"

"He's tidy," she said, and watched her father's eyebrows attempt a retreat. "And odd. In an organised way. I learn things. He'll go. He—might already have gone. He goes a lot."

"Ah," her father said, the sound that covers a dozen kinds of ache. "Useful people always get sent away. Doctors and plumbers and darlings. You mind yourself. Being fond of absent things is a habit the world rewards poorly."

On the train back she drew little triangles on the condensation on the window and then wiped them away because it looked like she was leaving signs for someone and it made her sad how little signs helped if you didn't know who you wanted to read them. When she got home she found an envelope on her mat with her name printed with a biro so precise it had its own spine. Inside was a photocopy of an article from a dry American journal about the effects of long-term low heat on plaster and a Post-it that said, in a neat hand, "For when walls are telling secrets," with an uncharacteristically ink-fingered smiley face. No name, and she would have known anyway because of the way the paper had been folded. The folds had decisions in them. She put the Post-it on the fridge like it could hold metal in place.

Friday gave them a barn at the edge of Barton with straw stacked like a skyline and a smell like a childhood she hadn't had. The sky did that pewter thing Derbyshire skies do when they are about to be indecisive. Hawley looked at it and declared he hated fields because they didn't have sockets. Connor cinched his chin strap to ritual tightness and said he'd rather fight ten barns than one council flat because barns did not talk back in voices. Kira went in with the second crew and felt heat as an organism that luxuriated and took its time in a way city heat never did. When it was all done they smelled of damp hay and tea and the kind of effort that makes your thighs hum for hours. Hawley let her stand with him while he drew a map that was less a drawing than a negotiation with the way air had been inside. He said the word "spalling" and the lad from their watch who hated long words looked like he'd found a nail and was considering it as a friend.

That night she didn't go to Coopers even though she had said she might. She was tired in the way you are when your muscles are more awake than your brain, a bright fatigue that tasted like blood in a friendly way. She sat on her floor with her back against the couch and watched the washing machine do its universe turn. The rhythm wound into her bones until her phone buzzed and shook it out. It was an email with no subject, and she opened it and saw nothing written, and then saw the attachment: a photograph of a blackboard with her own handwriting on it, her careful square ELIAS VALE, and beneath it a line in a different hand: plaster remembers heat and you, which was ridiculous and made her hand go entirely stupid. She wrote back, against her own better brain, "Do you always answer incantations with proverbs," and when no answer came she told herself that was fine, that some post gets lost in wars or in the mouths of servers.

When he did come back the next week, he looked as if someone had turned his saturation down two notches and then remembered to turn it up again, but too quickly. He stood at the door of the college classroom and the air looked relieved to have something to arrange itself around. The boat-tie man made room as if he were glad to go back to being the man with the memory of jokes instead of the man with responsibility. Elias wrote three words on the board—plaster, gas, candle—and turned to them with that same lighthouse face and said, "We're going to talk about how slow fire pretends to be polite and how it isn't." Kira breathed something that wasn't quite relief because that would have been admitting to a hunger. She took notes as if her hand were a reasonable animal she could tame with tidiness.

After class he didn't ask this time; he said, as if he were confirming a plan they'd made years ago, "The river," and she said, "Nigel," and they smiled like people holding glass things gently. They walked to the little coffee place with the sign that looked like someone had learned to paint by copying a sadness. Nigel resettled and gave a sigh so demonstrative Kira wanted to write it down. They sat. He held his cup. She drank hers and told herself not to mind that he never drank anything, that maybe he was the kind of person who took heat only from outside sources.

"Do you sleep," she asked, and then put her hand over her mouth like a child because it was impertinent and not hers to ask. He looked at her hand with interest, as if the apology itself were what he was meant to answer.

"I stand down," he said. "I am quiet. I am... stored. That is not the same as sleeping. Sometimes I want it to be. I'm learning to envy people for biological reasons, which is a surprise."

"Stored," she said, because the word lodged. "Like cutlery."

He laughed, that half-tone down. "Yes," he said. "Like knives that have to be told where to point."

She wanted to say, What are you, then, built man, careful man, not-drinking man, what are you that the world can send you and return you and you do not seem to chip at the edges. Instead she said, "We had a garage fire this week. The fuel poured like someone thought they were making an offering. We could smell the story. Hawley said he hates fields and I told him to grow up."

"He's good," Elias said. "The way his trousers sit on his boots makes me trust him."

"You fit people into categories with the speed I fit hose to outlet," she said. "How do you do that?"

"I have maps," he said. "I have algorithms. I have a thing that says: he looks like a person who will pick the right spanner three out of four times. You look like someone who will stand where the heat is and then regret it later but go anyway next time."

"That sounds unkind," she said, but she smiled because it was a relief to be decided.

"It's praise," he said. "I'm poor at compliments. They come out like instructions and that's not their job."

They walked the Washlands because the path there made space for the part of conversation that doesn't want to be a sentence yet. The river had its fat winter belly on, and geese drew lines on the air like someone practicing a language. He told her about teaching someone to wrap a wound with cloth pulled out of a box that had been used to carry pears, and she told him about the woman who had nearly set her flat on fire with incense and whose wall had a scorch mark that looked like a handprint and who had wanted to keep it because it made the room feel companioned. When they reached the bridge with the low rails and the plaque that said it had been rebuilt twice more often than the world had intended, he stopped and put his hands on the iron with the deliberation of a man negotiating with material.

"Do you ever think," he asked, "that the thing you most want to hold is exactly the thing you must not?"

"All the time," she said, surprising herself with how fast that answer came. "With a pan on fire. With a person leaving. With a name written where it shouldn't be."

"Ah," he said, and the syllable was soft enough that she had to lean in to catch it. "Names. There were—rooms. Where the men who ran them believed that if they did not write the names of what they were doing, the ethics would take longer to arrive. They were wrong. Ethics has a key as your father would say."

She said, "You listen when I talk," and he said, "I was made to," and then looked away as if he'd dropped a small vulnerable thing and didn't yet know if it had broken.

The case that changed her week came on a Monday night that had wrapped itself in wind. The call came in as domestic unknown smoke, which was code for no one had the right words yet, and when they got there the house was too quiet. The smoke was old smoke, thick with the resignation of upholstery. The neighbour said, "He hasn't opened the curtains since Christmas," and the way he said it made a red line under the sentence. They forced entry. The heat was low, the damage wrong. It had the look of a thing started politely. The old man was in the bedroom, under the duvet like he'd given up and been given release. The fire had eaten the bedside table slow and left the bed mostly dignified. Kira stood in the doorway and tasted the air. Kettles, she thought, and then thought no, the plastic had a bitterness she knew but couldn't name. She felt Connor's presence at her shoulder like a doorframe.

"Accidental," Naylor said in the yard, and his voice made the word do its job, which was to soothe everyone and give the day a coat it could wear.

Kira shook her head before she'd thought about the permission. "No," she said, low and unreasonable. "Not quite. It went slow. It didn't go in the order it wanted. Someone told it what to do and then walked away. The sockets... the low blistering... The bowls in the sink were wet. He wasn't making tea. He was—"

"Hush," Naylor said, not unkindly. "They'll get here. Don't have the fight when you can have it properly later."

Later meant Hawley on the phone and police and a woman in a coat that had been bought by someone else's budget. It meant Kira trying not to take the room's attention away from the man under the duvet and wishing the duvet had not been so careful. When she got home, she emailed Elias before she could draft and delete and redraft it into blandness. "Bedroom. Slow. Not wrong enough to say arson, wrong enough to say mind. Why do some fires feel like they have handwriting," she wrote, and then, "Do you have time to stand me next to a blackboard and point at me until I make sense."

His answer came as if it had been waiting at a junction to be waved through. "Tomorrow. Nine. If the river lets me. Bring a map of your house and your hands," he wrote, and the stupid giddy in her chest made her put her head briefly against the cool of the fridge.

They met in the room that had the owl pencil case woman and the housing officer and the second-row seat that had become Kira's geography. He had the projector alive with photographs quick as thought. He laid the old man's bedroom down on light. He circled the sockets with a pen that had a click that felt like a tick. He asked questions that were not questions so much as ways to put your mind into a shape and see if it fit. She answered and watched him notate her answers until the page looked like an anatomy of a conversation.

"You're not supposed to be here," she said at one point, with the kind of ruefulness you reserve for someone who is helping you in a way you're grateful for but suspect will cost both of you later.

"I'm not anywhere," he said. "That's my defence. I'm allowed to be useful wherever the light is on. What I think— and I can be wrong in ways that are unfashionable— is that someone has learned the rhythm of sympathy. They've learned that the right kind of mess looks like a mistake if you are tired and lonely and the house smells like damp. They did this before. We'll look for it. We may find it a door down in a different street entirely."

"Wax," she said, because Faye's voice from that first morning had lodged itself in her like an old nail. "Wax is mean."

"Waxy fires are liars," he said. "Write that down. No one will print it in a journal but it's the sentence people remember when they're tired."

She wrote it even though she would have anyway, then underlined it twice like she was not above curses. When she came out into the corridor with her notes she nearly ran into the silver-haired woman with the owl case, who had the affected calm of someone who had decided a while ago to be not surprised by much and regretted it on odd Wednesdays. The woman smiled like a person who'd learned to do it by watching others. "He'll get in trouble for this," she said, not warning but observation, and Kira wanted to ask who "he" was on the college payroll, what department, what box, what office hours, and then thought of that torso and the arm with the careful nails and felt the air change in her chest.

"Do you—what do you know about him," Kira asked, keeping her voice so casual it nearly fell over.

"I know he always returns his keys," the woman said. "And that his contract is with an agency whose emails never quite arrive and never quite don't. I know he has a way with the young men who come in here wanting to be steady and hoping that steadiness can be learned. He makes even their shoes look less stupid. He thinks he's hiding. He's wrong. We are all always seen."

Kira wanted to say, "By whom," but the woman had already walked away with her owl as if she had saved something for later and decided later was a better first, and Kira stood there feeling both ridiculous and bolstered, which is a human trick you practice until you can do it mutely.

The week turned over. The old man's fire became two other fires in two other houses, different streets, similar lies. Hawley called her and said, "You're a bad influence. Now I'm suspect of every polite blaze I meet," and she said, "Good. Politeness kills," and then had a moment where she imagined Elias saying the sentence and laughed out loud in the van and had to cover it with a cough. When she next saw Elias he smelled faintly of metal in a way she had not noticed before. He smiled and gave her a list with seven bullets that made them both happier than a poem ever had. On the second line it said: Look for matches in sinks, and she thought of the old man's bowls and his neat refusal of tea and thought fondly and sadly of the way someone had taken care doing a bad thing.

Faye noticed everything because she made a sport of pretending she didn't. "You smell of libraries," she told Kira one morning, messy ponytail and ancient hoodie and the kind of face that can only be formed by knowing how to tell someone they're being an idiot without losing them. "Are you getting a diploma in handsomeness."

"I'm getting a diploma in blistering and deceit," Kira said. "Also I'm carrying illicit tea because Nigel thinks I'm trustworthy."

"You are," Faye said. "Except with your own heart, which you keep in a cupboard and open in the dark."

Gaz got a splinter in his finger the size of a matchstick and made the sort of noise only men with splinters in fingers make. Connor tightened his chin strap and told them he was giving up sugar because he had woken up with an ache in his teeth that made his molars sound like a choir. Naylor told them about overtime and budgets and the way the council had decided to rename something no one wanted renamed. In between the things that don't make a story, Kira and Elias kept a rhythm that felt like people leaving breadcrumbs and then pretending surprise when the birds didn't eat them all.

They took a late walk under lights that had been put up for a festival that had ended a week earlier. The town wore them like someone who had kept a Christmas earring in by accident and then realised it was the nicest thing on her that day. Elias's shirt cuffs were very white, like new sheets. Kira wanted to finger the hem and see if the thread would snag. He told her about Doha the way you tell a friend about a place you had to visit for work and do not intend to visit voluntarily again. He said "white" and "glass" and "quiet," and each word had a little apology attached for not being enough. She told him about the boathouse they'd lost last autumn, about standing on wet concrete that remembered a building like a widow remembers a coat.

"How did it go," he asked, and she knew he meant her grief, not the fire.

"It went like everything," she said. "Badly at first and then it made me domestic. I bought a new kettle because the old one seemed to keep the sound of the morning we lost it."

"Objects hold noise," he said, with the simple certainty of someone quoting his own body.

The flood came back one night when it hadn't been invited and wasn't wearing anything appropriate. Rain set itself as a project and the river swelled up over its agreement. The Washlands became the Wash, full stop, and the little green benches put their heads down like beasts. The call that got them out of their bunks had that tone the pager only gets when water and electricity are making a plan together. Kira dressed with the speed that looks like slow motion because the space she moved through had been practiced so often it knew her before she arrived. They rolled through the town and the roads were a map of reflections. The boathouse's absence shouted. On the bank near the leisure centre the water did that trick of being beautiful and then treacherous in the same syllable. A car had been optimistic and then humbled. A man stood on its roof like a sad lighthouse. He waved as if to insist on his politeness.

They put on dry suits and Kira felt the rubber of it try to own her. She stepped into the river like bargaining with an animal. The current praised and punished. She and Faye did the dance they had been drilled to do. The man came down into their hands as if they were the hands he had always saved for. They walked him to land and the police made that grateful shape with their mouths. In the middle of it, in the corner of her eye, Kira saw a stillness that wasn't a thing rivers make. On the path, under the ash tree that had survived more flood than men had, he stood with his hands at his sides and his face set to lighthouse. He was not wearing a coat, which was wrong. He watched the water like it was a person and then, when she turned properly to look, he was not there. She looked for the tie and the pale cuffs and found a handful of dark instead. It could have been a trick of light. On the way back to the station she hated herself for wanting him to be omnipresent. That is a horrible desire to place on anyone, even a man made of lines.

In the morning she went to the college because she had not learned from the first time that buildings do not open because you wish. The room was unlocked because sometimes luck is in the boring places. There was chalk dust on the ledge like a soft argument for touch. She wrote his name and then, on a breath she didn't admit to, she wrote her own under it and underlined both once, because she had never been the kind of girl to draw hearts and she didn't know what else to do with the fact of herself. She sat in the second row out of habit and out of desire to change habit. The light made the dust in the air swarm the way it does in rooms with old heat. She waited until waiting made something in her core complain and then she got up and erased the names with the heel of her hand because there was dignity in mess if you chose it.

On her way out she passed the staff room again, because whatever else she was she was consistent, and the door was propped with a chair like someone had been halfway through a task and been reminded of another. On the table was a stack of boxes that smelled faintly of glue. One of them had been opened. Inside, nestled in white tissue, was a hand. It was silicone or something with more syllables, skin the pink of bad lipstick, nails pale and neat. For a second her stomach turned not with horror but with a recognition so sharp it had its own sound. She shut the lid and walked away, very briskly, as if the act of walking were a lie she could make convincing.

Naylor told her in his office later, while a radiator clicked like it was keeping time, that she'd been mentioned by Hawley in a report. He had a piece of paper on his desk that looked like a book had coughed it up. He didn't look up when he said it, which meant he was pleased and trying not to let it out and run wild. "Good eye," he said. "Good nose. Don't start thinking you're the only one in town who can see a spill and know its mother. But yes. Good. Try not to make enemies out of the paperwork lot. They think we are all muscle and hose and mud. If you make them like you they'll give us pens that work."

"I like pens that work," she said. "I like Hawley. He hates fields."

"Fields don't care if he hates them," Naylor said, and smiled. "It's a relationship that can only end well."

The next time she saw Elias it was because she accidentally asked the universe to give her that particular shock. She was at the corner of Station Street and the little cut-through that smelled of bleach and bakery when he came out of nowhere and into her life the way buses do when you've decided to walk. He had a brown paper bag that made the outline of books. He looked less pale, or she wanted him to be. He had a tiny nick on his lip like a child, and the desire to put her thumb to it rose in her like a sin and receded with the same tide.

"Hello," he said, as if they'd met in this place every week since the trains in the eighties learned to stop on time. "You are wet."

"Occupational hazard," she said. "I stood in a river and it tried to teach me manners. It failed."

"I saw," he said, and then put a hand up in a clumsy almost-apology between them. "No. I mean. I was—passing. I was on a path and the path was near. I didn't interfere. I'm not supposed to. I have rules."

"You always have rules," she said. "What happens when they don't fit?"

"I fold," he said. "I tuck. I make shapes until the rule lies down and looks like a blanket." He looked at her the way people look at a thing they want to take a measurement of without a tape. "Do you want to—"

"Coffee," she said, because she was past pretend. "Even if you pretend to drink and then don't. Nigel will forgive both of us."

Nigel snored through their politeness. The coffee tasted like a plan she could live with. He told her nothing about where the war had put him and everything about how people's faces looked when someone said the words "learn" and "triage" in the same sentence. She told him nothing about the fact that she had started waking up at three a.m. and doing star jumps in the kitchen to convince her heart to sit down, and everything about how good hose feels when you stand in the right place and let it make you its hinge. He told her he liked her father's timetables and her mother's kettles. She told him she liked and resented his symmetry. They stayed too long, and when they left he looked at the sky like a man checking the cue from a gods department and said, "I can't be—I'll go again."

"Yes," she said. "I'm trying to be fine with that. I'm failing in a reasonable way."

"You are reasonable," he said, and it sounded like the sort of sentence you only get told by people who have watched you tying rope. "And unreasonable. Two good tools to have."

She went to the college that night and did a thing she didn't want to name. She went into the room and wrote, with the care of someone who has learned that care is a kind of dignity, her own name first. And then his. She underlined neither. She sat in the first row. She stayed until the cleaner stuck a head in and said, "Love, you'll get mopped under if you sit there long enough," and Kira laughed and said, "I thought that was the point," and left, chalk dust under her nails like a motto.

They found the arsonist the way you find a shopping list on a pavement and realise it belongs to someone you know: by accident and with a jolt of recognition that made the ordinary world look briefly like a conspiracy. A man with a face that didn't know whether to be crude or gentle had bought too many candles in one shop and too many in another and then thought the CCTV were birds and that birds were on his side. Hawley sent a text the size of a paragraph with too many commas because his thumbs were square and excited. "We have him because he loved scent," Hawley wrote. "He mixed sandalwood with petrol like a romantic and the mix is like handwriting. You're right. Wax is mean. Also, I hate fields."

Kira sent the message to Elias without comment, and his reply came like a shrug you could live in: "Mean learns. So do we." Later, at night, when the rain was listening at the windows like a neighbour she liked, she lay on her back on her floor and imagined the old man in the bed and the politely ruined bedside table and she felt a noisy pity that wanted to get out of her and do jobs. She got up and did the washing up. The kettle made its good breath. She stood very still and let the world tilt around her and thought: I will stand. It isn't much, but it is what I have.

She was at her dad's again a week later because once you begin going you find ways to go, and because his cheeks had gone hollow in a way he would laugh at if she pointed it out. He had a box for her like he was handing her a small burglary. Inside was a frame, actual frame, wood that had known fingers. In it her mother stood on a beach in a wind that had decided to be a person that day, hair in her teeth, laughing like the sea was an old joke. Kira swallowed and felt that old, familiar sand at the back of her throat.

"Put her on a wall," her father said, and his mouth made a brave arrangement. "She's sick of living in drawers."

"I don't like nails," Kira said, and then corrected herself because being pedantic was something her father had taught her as a defence and sometimes defences are the most boring parts of you. "I don't like holes in walls. But yes. It's time."

"You're good at holes in other people's walls," he said. "Make one of your own. Call it fairness."

Back in Burton she hung the picture slightly wonky because she wanted the wall to know it was being lived with, not examined. She stood back, and the woman in the photo looked out at a flat East Midlands sea and laughed and Kira said aloud, because sometimes you say things to the dead and hope they put a kettle on, "I met a man who moves like maths. He might be a mistake. You'll like him," and then she laughed at herself and put the hammer away like she'd been caught. The next morning, leaving for shift, she touched the frame like a shoulder and told her mother the weather.

The war went on in the corner of rooms, turned up or down as the day decided. Sometimes the volume was generous. Sometimes it ate everything else. There were rumours the way there always are; the sort that start in staff rooms and get improved by people in pubs until they walk back into staff rooms wearing different shoes. Kira heard the words "autonomous training platform" said by a man who also used the word "widget" without shame and filed them under "things the world was doing without asking her." She did not need names for the boxes the world kept Elias in. She wanted a name she could write on a board and have it carry the weight of someone arriving.

He arrived on a Wednesday when she had decided he would not. The sky was indecisive and the Washlands did their small breathing. He knocked on the station door, which was ridiculous and somehow right. He had a tie that wasn't the colour of bruises; it was the colour of the inside of a plum. He looked at the bays like a man looking at ships in a harbour. Naylor came out and put his mouth into the polite shape he does for members of the council and men who pay for calendars. Elias said, "Good morning," and Naylor said, "Who are you," and Kira made a decision that surprised her with its suddenness.

"This is Elias," she said, before introductions could be made with letters after names. "He has a thing to say about wax. It's fine. He doesn't drink coffee. He won't ask for it."

Naylor narrowed his eyes not at Elias but at Kira because his job included counting the decisions his people made and keeping a ledger he seldom showed. "Five minutes," he said, and went back to a spreadsheet that had more columns than dignity.

Elias walked through the appliance bay like a man in a church who understands the order of service without believing. He ran a fingertip along the side of the pump not like a caress but like a reading. He turned to her and said, "There is a thing I want to tell you, and I am inept with telling. I have been lent again. The place is different. The words they use are different. I will go and return with a new sharpness and I don't know if that will be an improvement."

Kira looked at him and understood that not telling the truth would be the easiest thing in the world here and that therefore she was obliged to speak it. "I am tired of you going," she said. "I am not the kind of woman who asks for more. I am not that animal. But I am tired of you being a thing I have to conjure with chalk."

He closed his eyes in that peculiar precise way, as if each lid had to be placed. "Then," he said, and she saw him make a decision that looked like a line straightening on a screen, "I will leave you something you can call. Not my name. Something better. A list. When the river goes up, when the house pretends to be kind, when paper lies, when the room is frightening, when you think of me and don't want to, here. Stand like this. Breathe like this. Walk to the corner of the room and name the four coldest things. Then the four warmest. Then the four loudest. Then the four quietest. This is not a charm. It is a map. It is something I do when I am being put away."

She wanted to say, "Do not be put away," as if words could be bolted across a door. Instead she said, "Write it down. Your handwriting makes stupid things look serious. I want to pin it to an owl."

He smiled and took a card from his pocket the way a magician does when he's going to make a dove into a handkerchief and wrote, with a pen that made a narrow black that looked like a promise, four cold four warm four loud four quiet, and handed it to her like it was a biscuit. She took it and felt better and worse in equal measure.

After he had gone and the day had found its normal, Kira took the card to her locker and tacked it next to the calendar where Gaz had written Camp Nou in March for reasons no one had been brave enough to ask about. She looked at her list and felt for a second that she could stand in a burning building and talk the fire into doing tricks. Then she laughed at herself very quietly because bragging is a thing only fools dare in this work, and got on with wiping hose like she was in a monastery she had chosen.

At night, because the night is always where we go to ask stupid questions of ourselves, she dreamed again of corridors and doors with names and the way chalk hangs in the air after being hurried. In this one, the room at the end was not a classroom but the station bay, the pump mouths like great animals waiting for work. Elias stood with his hands at his sides, that human non-gesture he had made his signature. He was entirely still, and yet the air around him moved as if heated. He said nothing. A radio in someone else's hand said, be advised, be advised, be advised, and she wanted, so much she could feel it ache in her teeth, to put her hand into the space between his cuff and his skin and find out if the heat there was human, and then she woke with her own wrist pressed to her mouth and the taste of salt and soap and stubbornness on her tongue. She got up and boiled the kettle and the house swore and then made peace with her, and she thought: I will not ask to be saved. But I might ask for company while I fail at it, and then she made tea and put out two mugs, which was idiotic, and left the second one there until it was cold, which was not.Spring didn't announce itself with blossom so much as with a loosening. The river stopped sulking and started gossiping. The ground went from a hard "no" to a grudging "all right then," and mud made a return in the way old friends do, messy and more honest than you're in the mood for. The breweries changed register; the malt smell sat lower and sweeter, a bass line under the mornings. Kira ran along the Washlands and felt the path pong back at her footfalls like a drum. She told herself she was not listening for a particular footstep in a corridor on a particular third floor in an old wing. She was an adult in a town that smelled of sugar and floodwater and she could contain her wanting like you hold a pan lid down when the pasta tries to climb out.

A letter arrived in a cellophane windowed envelope that had opinions about punctuality. It was from the Fire Investigation training office and it said, in the kind tone bureaucrats use when they intend to give you real work, that there was a placement slot on Wednesdays if she wanted it and if her watch could spare her and if she could put up with the smell of damp plaster and men who drew diagrams on napkins. Naylor read it over her shoulder and said "Hawley will be insufferable," which was his way of saying yes, and then took the letter out of her hand and pinned it to the notice board as if it might turn and run. Gaz clapped once like a schoolboy and then remembered he was against enthusiasm on principle. Faye kissed the side of Kira’s head without warning and said "Bring me back exotic vocabulary and a biscuit I don’t have to share," and went to find a clean mug like generosity.

She went to the first Wednesday in boots she'd cleaned twice, for luck. The FI office was in a building that had once been a shoe shop and now wore that history the way you wear a jumper until it becomes your skin. Hawley was in a jumper that had known better days and trousers that had never known any. He gave her a folder and a biro that wrote reluctantly and said, "Welcome to the department of things that don't want to tell you what happened until you've bored them into confession. Sit there. Don't look at my sandwich. It's private." He walked her through cause matrices and the long slow pleasures of making a hypothesis and then despising it. He told her she could be wrong as often as she liked as long as she could write down what she was wrong about with proper nouns.

They called out that afternoon to a mid-terrace that had burned its living room in a way that would have looked like grief if you were the sort to anthropomorphize heat. The sofa had done its cloud trick; the curtains had failed politely; the TV had wept plastic on its own feet. Kira stood and watched the patterns with the careful hunger of someone reading a diary they have no right to read and every obligation. She crouched and put her hand near the skirting to feel the ghost of the path the fire had taken and she thought of the way Elias had said geometry and then apologized for romance. Hawley asked what the room was trying to hide. She said, "A candle with a conscience and a badly placed magazine. And—," and then stopped because the magazines had been moved. Hawley grunted, which in his language could mean a dozen things. Later, over a table in the office that had made its peace with scorch marks, he pushed a mug towards her and said, "You sees it. Good. Keep seeing it and don't start thinking you're fancy. Fancy gets you wrong and makes you unbearable." She promised to be unbearable only on Fridays and he snorted and let her have the biscuit he didn't intend to share.

At the college, the owl pencil case woman had a different pencil and nodded at Kira in a way that felt like being allowed into a club that believed in silence and heat and the usefulness of pocket lint. The boat-tie man had left a box of chalk in mourning. The board wore notices about exams and pastoral care and two missing umbrellas. Kira went into the empty classroom and stood in the second row because habit is its own country and then, cross with herself, slid into the first. She wrote his name in tiny letters in the top corner of the board like a secret someone could be pleased to find. Then she rubbed it off with her sleeve because dignity is a thing sometimes best performed only for yourself.

On a Thursday, coming back from a school visit with a bag full of charred toast they had artificially blackened to make a point, she cut through the college corridor and saw a caretaker—the sort of man who looks like he knows how to fix everything as long as no one writes an email about it—wrestling a wheeled crate with the top half open. Inside were torsos in their packaging, faces up and unbothered, mouths O-ed for oxygen that would never come. He grinned at her like he'd been told to inventory the uncanny and was making the best of it. "Paramedic lot," he said by way of explanation. "We used to have the ones with wigs. People nick the wigs. You'll laugh. A lot of money, these. You'd not believe where they come from."

"Do I want to know," she said, not sure she did.

"Oxford," he said, triumphant. "And a place with a name like a sneeze. The invoices say 'platform' instead of 'mannequin.' Makes me imagine sending one of them to Mallorca with a packed lunch." He tugged the crate closed with competent hands. "You lot coming in tonight? Boat chap back, the one with the good ties. He gets the lights to behave. When he's around the bulbs all stop arguing."

"He's not boat," she said, because she couldn't help it. "He just... stands very still."

The man shrugged the shrug of someone who has seen a thing across decades and knows better than to name it. "He's a good weight in a room. We could do with more of that," he said, and pushed his crate down the corridor with the tender contempt of a man who has been told to lock up someone else's ghosts.

Kira texted Faye a photograph of the crate and Faye wrote back: do not shag a mannequin, and then, a beat later, sorry, was that sexist towards mannequins, and Kira laughed and typed: Nigel would intervene, and put her phone away like it might misbehave if left alone.

He came that evening, not to teach but to stand at the back and watch someone else do it. The new instructor was a woman with a beautiful blunt voice and the kind of hair you get when you have made peace with scissors and mornings. She spoke about smoke reading in sentences that made Kira want to take off her boots and sit on the floor like a child. At the break, Kira found herself in the corridor and he was there and their faces did that small adjustment faces do when they recognize someone they have permitted into their present tense. There was a line on his wrist, a neat straight thing like the memory of a watch. It didn't match anything a person should remember. She wanted to ask. She didn't. Her tongue was a good citizen tonight.

"I went to your room," he said. "You wrote my name so small it would need a microscope to find its dignity."

"You saw," she said, and then wished she hadn't sounded so pleased.

"I am designed to," he said, with a half smile that made something in her chest go generous and stupid. "Also, the light was at the right angle. It's not all design. Sometimes it's physics."

They went to Nigel. Nigel had a new collar that said "Assistant Manager" and took his role seriously by refusing to wake. The girl behind the counter had dyed her hair back to blue and said, "We have a new cake that is made from a plant," with the contempt of the righteous. They sat and he held a mug that had been clean for less than a minute and he did not drink and she promised herself she would not mind that or make it a metaphor. Outside, a boy ran past and threw himself at nothing in particular the way boys will and then laughed because his body had agreed with him.

"Do you know," Elias said, not quite looking at her, "that there is a place near here where they keep a whole building's worth of weather in a box. They use it to teach engines how to forgive. I was in a room like that last week and thought of your river. It does its own teaching. Less interested in forgiveness."

"I feel disloyal telling you this," she said, "but the river is only faithful to itself. It will keep you alive if you flatter it, and it will take you if you forget what your legs are for."

"Yes," he said. "I like it for that. Systems that tell you what they are if you're listening. I am in rooms at the moment where the system is lag. By the time you hear what has happened, it did it three seconds ago. You learn to count backwards. You learn the length of a second by the heat on your skin. And now I sound like your instructor," and he smiled, apologizing to an absence.

She watched his mouth the way she watched a training dummy breathe when someone else pumped its chest. She told herself to be appropriate. She told herself to ask about his tie, which was the colour of thunderstorms. She told him about the old man and the bedside table and the way wax had lied last week and how Hawley had cheered in his square thumbs way when they found the candle brand's receipt in a kitchen drawer next door. He put his head on one side, that ballet-mandated motion, and said, "You are learning to name the intent when the matter won't speak. That's ugly work. It suits you."

"That's a terrible compliment," she said, and then couldn't stop smiling for almost a whole minute.

The big job came on a Friday night when the town had decided it was allowed to be loud. A call for a small brewery on the edge of an industrial estate that had never quite been confident in its industrialness. The first puff they saw coming off the roof was not the friendly white of a boiler complaining. This was brown, meaning organic, meaning upholstery, meaning a lie or at least an exaggeration. They took the doors, and heat breathed back at them with rugby shoulders. It was glue day in the adjacent unit, adhesives that went off in a time frame a man could misjudge and then regret. There were solvent drums stacked with optimism. Kira's mask gave her the Darth Vader voice the kids loved and she hated, and she went in with Gaz on the jet and the air did that thing where it wraps around your head and negotiates. Something popped where it shouldn't. She felt the room go conversationally quiet in the way rooms do when they're about to shout. Her body wanted to be everywhere and nowhere.

She remembered his list like a hand around her throat gently. Name four cold. The floor near the door. The tank near the roller shutter that sweated bravely. The metal of the nozzle where the water still ran through it unadvised. The little coin of sweat at the base of Connor's ear that hadn't decided to go. Four warm. The door jamb on the inside that had been making decisions without her. The air on her calves because heat knows you by your ankles. The hose where it kinked and tried to behave. The breath in her mask. Four loud. The hum in the steel that meant the solvent drums were arguing. Gaz's inventing swears. The noise of water insisting. Her own heart. Four quiet. The space under the rack where the cat would be if this were a different building. The negative roar when fire pulls breath and you feel it like theft. The absence of alarms because they'd been silenced by someone thinking that would help. The half-second between pop and pop, which was time measured by luck. It put her back in herself enough to move left, and the something that did go then did so where she had just been. Later she would not try to make sense of the order of that, because you can't feed yourself on the particular ways luck chooses you. She got the jet where it needed to be. Connor did that thing with his chin strap where he treated it like an oath. They got it out, out in a way that wasn't elegant but was final, and when they compromised the wall and found the way the heat had been eating behind everything all along, Hawley made a noise that was not a triumph so much as a yes.

Afterwards, sitting on the floor back at the station with her kit peeled off like shame and a foil blanket someone had pushed at her without asking, Faye took the card out of Kira's locker and looked at it and then at Kira and her mouth made a shape very nearly like scolding and then didn't quite. "Four cold," Faye said, "is the side of Gaz I use when he gets political. Where did you get this. It's clever and slightly worrying."

"A man with a tie," Kira said. "Do not make me box my own heart up about it. I needed it."

Faye folded the card back along the same crease Kira had been careful with and put it in the exact same place, which was its own kind of affection. "We all need maps. Just don't start leaving your common sense at home in exchange. Your common sense owes me a pint."

Hawley wrote her name on a report like someone signing a book out of a library. He said, "Department say yes to you Wednesdays. You don't get special biscuit allotment. You are clever and you will be obnoxious. Try to keep the obnoxious for the bit where it helps," and she said, "I'll gift-wrap it," and he groaned in approval. He took her to a seminar where a man from Nottingham said "ignitable liquids" with such relish Kira wondered if he ate them for breakfast and then told herself off for being unfair because someone has to love the long words, and if it wasn't the man from Nottingham then the long words might go lonely.

News slid behind the day like a shadow. There were rumours of a training facility requisitioned near the airport, and a lad in the pub told Gaz he'd seen a lorry convoy at midnight that had looked like science fiction trying to keep a low profile. The college timetable had more white gaps in it than days, and people said "resilience" more than they said "hello," which suited some and depressed the rest. The silver-haired woman with the owl pencil case told Kira she was learning to listen to plaster the way you listen to a friend who isn't telling you everything and that it had made her kinder to walls and less patient with people. Kira told her father on the phone about the adhesives and the drums and the four cold, four warm, and he said, after a pause, "So he gave you the thing I gave your mum when we were poor. Name the solid things in front of you and the noises at your back and be a person between them. I like him better for that. Tell him if he hurts you I'll make a timetable for his regret."

She met Elias by accident in the place where accidents like to happen, by the door to Nigel's café, as if someone who wrote pages had thrown the two of them into the paragraph together and then walked away. He didn't look like winter any more and he didn't look like spring. He looked like something being kept at a temperature for transport. There was a new nick along his cheekbone, longer, like the ruler had slipped. He didn't cover it up. He looked at her like he was taking a reading.

"You used it," he said, and she didn't ask which it was, because she had.

"Yes," she said. "It wasn't a charm. It worked anyway."

"It isn't supposed to work," he said. "It's supposed to be a way of standing somewhere that will let your legs tell your head what to do. It was given to me. I am passing on the theft. Do you want—"

"Yes," she said, and smiled at herself for the hunger.

Nigel was off; a boy with a haircut that must have been an argument was pretending too hard not to care about properly tamping espresso. They sat. There was a lull in the coffee shop that felt like the inside of a shell. He asked about Hawley and the adhesives and the man with sand in his face who had wept when he remembered his wife once told him not to stack the drums like that. She asked, in a voice that aimed at brisk and missed, "Are you all right," and he waited the smallest count before answering, and she watched the wait and knew it was habit not dishonesty.

"I am functioning," he said. "My left leg learns a new thing now and then which makes the old thing get jealous. I think about shutting down when it is light out, not just when I am told. I have learned to envy people their small failures. The sort you can do in public and call character."

"You do public very well," she said. "We all admire you for it. Your legs included. I'm starting to think you wear the white shirts so we can watch if you spill."

"That's a cruel thought," he said, and it wasn't an objection. "I like cruel. It shows you are awake. Would you— I have to go. If I don't there will be a man in a building with too much glass who will look at a cycle in a screen and tell me about it in a tone that pretends we are equals. It is tiresome to be told you are a number by a man who doesn't know he is one. There is a room later. I will be allowed out. It is a good room. There is a bench that has been sat on by people who forgive. Come."

"Where," she asked, because she had not learned to follow men who offered benches.

He named a building near the Washlands, not the college, an administration block the council had tried to prettify by giving it a painting of the river that didn't look like the river. She put the time in her phone as if the phone were a place things could be true.

In between, life asserted its elbows. A call to a top-floor flat where a fuseboard had read the temperature wrong and done a little dance that ended in smoke. A school visit where a girl in a cardigan with cars on it asked Kira if fire could be kind if you asked nicely and Kira said, "It is never kind but it is sometimes honest," and the girl nodded with the gravitas of someone who knew she was being given an adult answer and put it in her pocket for later. Gaz told a story about his aunt's budgie that had learned to mimic the doorbell and ruined three marriages. Connor tried a week without sugar and then rejoined the world with a Mars bar and tears in his eyes. Faye showed Kira how to French braid her hair one-handed because being a woman with long hair and a helmet makes you an engineer whether you want to be or not.

The room he had mentioned had a bench that was trying to be a pew and failing, which was endearing. It had a window that believed in river light, and the river obliged by doing its small shining. He was there before her, which felt like a magic trick even though it was only timekeeping. He stood with his hands at his sides, a posture that in anyone else would have screamed military and in him looked like courtesy towards gravity. He turned at the exact instant she closed the door, as if there were a hinge between them. He didn't smile, and it didn't feel like a lack.

"I won't apologize for the ask," he said. "I wanted to see you when I wasn't being watched by people who are learning to watch."

"I am learning to watch," she said. "I'm very good at it. You can borrow my eyes if you tell me when to look away."

"Don't look away now," he said, and moved his cuff back, just enough, a small domestic act that would have been flirtation in anyone else. There was a line at his wrist that the white shirt hadn't fully hidden, a join so fine that the word seam would have been a disservice. It was, if she was going to be precise and she always was, an articulation. She reached out, because for once she let her body be unedited, and then stopped a finger's width from his skin because consent is a word she dressed the world in and she was determined not to take it off.

"May I," she asked, and didn't know which of them she was surprising more.

"Yes," he said, and in the syllable was a small relief like a door that had remembered it could open. Her fingertip met the place where skin and not-skin made a treaty, and she thought of the mannequin hand in tissue, and the way he didn't drink, and the way he paused before sentences as if a wire had to decide, and she thought: none of this makes him less. She slid her finger away, because reverence is tiring if you do it too long.

"I am," he said calmly, like a man explaining a timetable. "That. The words they use for us are ugly or self-aggrandizing. I prefer built. It implies hands. There were hands. There are still hands. I am here. That is the sum. I am here and I stand and I teach and sometimes I am sent to rooms where men use the word 'deploy' about people who can't spell 'shoe.' If you need a noun, I am staff. If you need a verb, I am an assist. If you need me to be a man for the sake of making sense, I am better at that on Thursdays."

She sat down because her knees pretended to fail, which was a kindness they did when they wanted to give her an excuse. The bench felt like wood that had listened to arguments about cuts and then been used as a coat stand. She thought of her mother cutting bread with a cheap knife and her father reading a timetable like it was a psalm and she thought of the way the fire had licked along the underside of the warehouse rack with an elegance she would never forgive. She breathed in and the room offered her its dust.

"I don't need you to be a man," she said, and then amended because the truth could be tidy as well as ugly. "I need you to be a person. Which you are. Some people who were born don't manage it. You do. I am not the sort to fall for a chalkboard. I appear to have become the sort. We will keep this precise. I am fond. I will not smash it by naming it anything heavy. I will also not lie to either of us."

He sat opposite, which made the room look like a stage. He kept his hands where she could see them, which she imagined was training and courtesy and a little bit fear. The cut on his cheek looked less like an accident and more like a maintenance note. He watched her like a man learning a road.

"I don't know how to be held in the ways holding is done," he said. "I know how to be given a task. I could be set to entire lives and I would make them tidy and frightening. I am learning to like mess. You are havoc in fine boots. I could love you. That is not a sentence I am authorized to say. I am saying it in my free hours. This is me in my free hours. I will go. I will be put away. I will come back. I will stand where you ask me. If you write my name I will try to find the room. If I don't it is because someone has put my box somewhere without windows. I want to be honest without making you responsible for me. I am not a kettle. You cannot boil me."

She laughed then, sharply and sweetly, because the alternative was to ignore the odd happiness that had just kicked the door in. "That's good," she said. "I hate when men whistle. I like you enough to be cross with you when you go. I like you enough to admit I will use chalk like a witch when I'm tired. I like you enough to make you promise to tell me when you can't stand. You seem like someone who would do that quietly so as not to put anyone out. I want to be put out. I want to come. I am not a hero. I am a woman who can carry a hose and read a wall and name cold things. That is what I have."

"That is all I want," he said, and there was in his voice a little static that sounded like gratitude and a bad wire getting along for once. "That and your father's timetables. He frightens me with his vowels. I like him. He will never approve of me. He will. Given time. I can stand very still. Men like your father like it when things do that near their daughters."

"Don't get ahead of yourself," she said, because hope is a cruel animal if you let it see you. "He thinks all good things are trains. I will not break the laws of his physics for you. He can learn another map."

They sat with that until the room stopped needing their hearts to make it less echoey. When she left, he didn't touch her. That felt not like refusal but like engineering. Outside, the river had decided to throw a little light at anyone who had eyes. She stood on the path and tried to decide whether the tilt of the world was more or less now that she'd been told the truth she had, in one corner of her, always known. She didn't decide. She cycled home and the air put its fingers in her hair and she told herself: name four cold, and she named the handlebars, the metal of the railing, the patch of frost that sulked in shade, the coin of sweat at the back of her neck that had decided to be brave. She thought: there are worse ways to be alive.

At three in the morning the pager did its nasty little insect song and she got up and was out the door in a time that would not impress an athlete but would look elegant to a corpse. Domestic, smoke issuing, occupants unaccounted, the radio said in a voice that had learned to be auntie and drill sergeant at once. The house was close, mercifully, and the street was a chorus of pyjamas and judgement. The front door was locked in a way that didn't make sense if fear had been the person who did it. They forced it. The stairs were clean enough it was a lie. The heat on the right was wrong for the time they'd been given. They found him on the floor at the end of the hall, a big man who had the obedience of someone who had been polite to heat and been repaid with cigarettes. Kira dragged and swore. Her mask made her sound like a film at three a.m. The hallway went narrow in the way houses do when they've realized they're going to keep their secrets. She felt the world go to a point at her temples. Then she had the presence of mind to be annoyed with herself for forgetting the list.

Four cold. The brass letter slot. The border of the mirror frame that had survived three owners. The wet patch where someone had dropped a towel and not picked it up. The line of draught along the skirting that had ambitions. Four warm. The doormat that hoarded heat like gossip. The sleeve of the man at her feet, cooked a little. The door at the end, persuading her to be foolish. The back of her neck. Four loud. The house making its tired argument. Connor's boots on the tiles. Faye saying her name in a tone that was almost a laugh and almost a slap. The slight roar that means the kitchen is trying not to tell tales. Four quiet. The space behind her eyes when she puts her head wrong. The inside of her glove where her pulse is arrogant. The air in the top left of the hall, which is learning to be oxygen again. The place on the stair where no one has stood for years. It was enough to make her do the thing with her legs that her head hadn't ordered. She got the man out. Outside, someone cried like a child even though they were not. The world had the decency to keep spinning.

She texted him from the back step at the station once it was all over and the smell of someone else's burnt door had left her hair. "It worked again," she wrote. "You have a good theft. I will return it when I learn my own." He wrote back, a minute later, as if he had been standing in a room with his hands at his sides waiting for permission to speak. "Keep it. Build your own. Put mine on top when the floor is wet. Stand," he wrote, and then, oddly, "tea," which made her laugh and go in to put the kettle on because sometimes instructions are acceptable when they are mostly a kindness.

On her doormat in the morning there was a small parcel wrapped in brown paper that had decided to be dignified. Inside, folded with a care that had hands in it, was a tie the exact colour of storms over fields. There was a card with three words: for symmetry, E. She stared at it long enough that a ridiculous thought occurred to her: that she could learn to tie a tie, which was the kind of domestic skill her mother would always pretend not to know and her father used to mourn missing. She took it to the station and looped it around the locker hook and when Faye saw it she raised an eyebrow without raising judgement and said, "If you're going to get married to a neckwear, tell me early so I can plan a cake," and Kira said, "I'm going to elope with a list," and they both looked at the tie like it could hear and accept terms.

There were days after that where nothing happened and the nothingness had teeth. The war got louder in a way that didn't involve decibels. A man in a pub said he’d seen something fly at night that didn't need a person and had manoeuvred like a swan and Kira said, "All right, Bill," and bought him a pint because she didn't have room for more nouns for fear. The boat-tie man came back for a session and told them about plaster bubbles with the delight of a child with a new stamp. Hawley took Kira to a seminar in a town hall built to pretend at importance where the tea tasted of everyone who'd used the urn before you and on the way back he said, "I had a mentor called Trevor who could name the cause of a fire with his thumb. He was wrong almost as often as he was right, and he was loud about both. He died. You can tell I loved him because I miss him and call him Trevor. You'll be Kira to someone some day. Try to be worth the two syllables."

She wrote his name on the board less often because rituals, too, deserve rest. She did, twice, write hers. She underlined it once. She did it because women sometimes have to remind rooms that they exist and because it made the chalk dust look friendly on her fingers. Once, leaving, she thought the corridor had a shadow that moved like a person trying not to be seen. She didn't chase it. She went home and framed a photograph of her mother in earnestness and hung it almost straight. When the kettle breathed she said, "I'm trying. This is ridiculous and proper," and her mother in the picture laughed at the East Midlands sea like it had told a good joke.

When the time came for him to go again he didn't do it by email. He knocked at the station door with the knuckles of a polite man and Naylor let him in the way you let a cat in and pretend you meant to keep it. He stood in the bay under the strip lights and said, quietly, "Four weeks. I am lent to a place with more rules than rooms and more doors than names. If you need me, write my name. If you don't, write yours, so I have a reason to behave."

"You don't need a reason," she said, and heard herself and wanted to laugh and couldn't. "You are reason enough for yourself. I will write your name to make the room draw breath. I will not do it because I am a witch. I am not a witch. I am a woman who knows where the hot is and where the cold is and how to get people through both. When you come back you have to drink coffee. Nigel is going to get a complex."

"I don't know if I can," he said, and her shrug was affectionate enough to be almost rude.

"Learn," she said. "Witches can be taught. I learned to plait Faye's hair with one hand. You can learn to swallow."

He laughed, the note down a half tone, and she stored the sound the way you put an extra slice of bread in the bread bin because you'll need it when you don't want to leave the house. He left, not like a man leaving a stage, but like a man closing a cupboard he promised himself he'd open soon. The bay held the shape of him for longer than seemed reasonable. Kira stood where he'd stood and named four cold. The tyres. The spanner. The metal lip where someone had left a screwdriver and it had been rescued by a miracle. The tie in her locker. Four warm. The sunlight that had decided to be generous. The top of the pump, heated by work. The memory of a hand she hadn't touched. Her own throat. Four loud. Gaz outside telling a story about a budgie. Faye complaining about socks. The river, doing gossip. Four quiet. The place where names go when you don't say them. The part of her that had given up thinking she was safe when the world tilted. The chalk dust on her fingers. The bench in the good room waiting. She stood. She did the job. She kept a chalk stub in her pocket until it wore itself away with the comforting rudeness small strong things have.The first Monday after he left again, the river wore its ordinary face and Kira became suspicious of that. People only ever remark on water when it is certain about something, flood or glass; in its undecided moods it is easier to ignore, which is what she had trained to do with her heart. She put her kit in the same place in the locker because there is steadiness in rectangles, checked her BA even though she wasn't supposed to be on the board for a job that needed it, and went to the office with the clipboard state of mind that made Hawley like her and Naylor pretend not to. The FI placement had quickly taught her that evidence hides in boredom. You make phone calls that sound like you are arranging carpet fitting; you measure apertures and write down numbers with the patience of a person working with children; you ask people questions in rooms where the kettle has only ever made an argument for itself and you listen for the part where grief stops rehearsing the good version and blurts the messy one instead. Hawley said, with his sandwich logic, that you got maybe one revelation a week and if you were greedy you missed the small ones, the way a person stares out the window waiting for fireworks and fails to see the toy balloon pop past at eye level.

The revelation that week came in the form of a soot thumbprint on a page of a free newspaper. A mid-terrace on Uxbridge Street had done its shuddering combustion, the sort you could stitched-together call electrical if you didn't fancy yourself brave, and the cousin who had wandered round when the neighbour knocked spoke in the slow leavings of a man who had learned to be calm because it kept him beloved. The room was too generous with its story. Kira crouched because the truth is nearer the floor than people want. She saw the proper inverted V where the skirting had been ashamed of its hunger and then, lower, on the edge of a fallen magazine left under a stool, a streak of black that did not belong to the normal physics of burning paper. The magazine was not a Bible. It was an advertisement for flooring with a model kitchen so pale it made her eyes itch. The thumb had pressed where the corner folded. Hawley grunted approval the way he did when he knew he'd be the one to type the report and made peace with it in advance. The lad with the high-vis shoulders asked her if she would put her money on a man or a woman and she said, "A person who reads adverts and smokes. They are equal opportunities crimes," and he looked at her with that look of a person trying to file you under a word you might agree to. When they left, the neighbour gave Kira a carrier bag of tomatoes from a greenhouse she called "the sanctuary" and the way she said it made Kira want to put the tomatoes in her pocket so they could feel her pulse.

On Wednesday in the FI office, Hawley made her copy out three pages of a textbook about failed self-extinguishment without swearing, because handwriting is a way to make a thought pass through your body. He then showed her photographs of a church fire that had eaten Saint Whoever's nave as if it had been saving appetite. "Old wood is vindictive," he said, dotting a salt crystal from his sandwich onto the picture with absent-minded malice. "People call it noble and then they don't dust behind the altar. Read me the story backwards." She did, out loud, and it was not the right story, and then again, quieter, and it was better. He nodded. He told her he would take her on the recon because he trusted her to keep a straight face when Father Michael tried to baptize the cause. It smelled, he said, like incense and electrics, which was a domestic sort of doom.

At the station, life performed its useful little loops. Gaz got a bee in his hood and declared himself an enemy of all pollinators despite having a tattoo of a bee he never admitted to. Faye shaved two inches off her hair with a blunt scissors and declared herself lighter by a full half-stone of opinion. Connor attempted to learn knots he already knew because sometimes the mind wants to be tricked into thinking it is making progress by relearning things with better finger memory. Naylor stood with a printout in his hands that could have been a poem if someone loved budgets and said he had been told to save seven pence by Tuesday. They laughed because otherwise people break.

On an overnight that began with bad soap opera and crisps and ended with a siren that tasted like adrenaline, they went to a canal boat that had chosen the wrong evening to be romantic. The glow of it at the far bend was a lie and an invitation. Boats burn differently from houses. There is a fatigue to the heat that comes off wood that has thought too long about water; it carries its muscle differently. Kira felt it like a familiar combined with stranger at the same time. The couple on the towpath were apologising to the night while crying, a British feat. Connor tightened his chin strap, and she laughed under the mask with that pre-fight bravery that lives in your ribs. They went in with respect. A boat is a corridor that can decide to be a coffin if you are impolite. The heat did its around-the-corner trick and she named four cold, four warm, four loud, four quiet again because any incantation is better than making up a new one when your breath is doing arithmetic without your consent. They put it out, insofar as anyone puts anything out. The smell of damp rope lives in the hair longer than some men do.

Later, when Burton had yawned and tucked itself in, the email arrived with no subject. It came at the hour between three and four when the body is the least convinced of its own decision to be alive and minds perform being burglars in their own houses. It was two sentences, too neat to be improvised, which meant he had improvised and then tidied it. "I am ordinary tired," it said. "I will be in rooms without corners for a fortnight; if I am sent to the ones with corners I will leave first." She stared at the "ordinary" as if it were a pet you had to teach not to bring dead birds into the house. She wrote back the nouns she had collected that day—rope, nave, tomato—and a line about small boats carrying big fires, and then deleted it and wrote instead, "I saw a thumbprint on a lie and thought you'd like that," and went back to sleep in that way people return from a place they only nearly left.

On a Saturday she took the train to Loughborough with a bag of curry pastes her father wouldn't use and a picture frame she intended to force on him because he had never owned anything with corners rounded on purpose. The train did its polite stop-start through suburbs that looked tidier from windows than they would from pavements. Her father met her with a look that went quickly from planning to relief to its own kind of defensiveness. He showed her a list he'd made of all the things she might want to do while she was here as if Loughborough were wild and Museum-adjacent. She made tea and he complained about the kettle with an intimacy and she insisted his radio be turned down two notches because football men imagining they are articulate makes her feel like a poster on a wall.

In the afternoon she told him, against her better sense and with a careful voice, about the man with the white shirts and the built wrists. She did not say collectively the words that would turn him into a science fiction that her father had never asked for. She said: he is built, and watched her father flat his palm against the table in the habit he had when he was thinking on the page. He looked at the window. He looked at her face. He did not look at the radio because football men are poor company when you have to consider what it means to be personed.

"We are all built," he said after a long enough count for both of them to have found a breath. "Some by mothers with bad hair by the sea and some by men in rooms with invoices. Some of us build ourselves out of spite and tea. I do not care if your man is screws and sugar. I care if he has manners. If he speaks to you like a puzzle you have to solve to be worth his time, I will dislike him. If he stands still when you need a thing to be still, I will learn his name. If he drops your heart, I will put it back with plasters and glue and then later I will find his timetable and make it late."

"He's not my man," she said, and the word my made a little wave in the room they both pretended not to see. "He is—exact. He doesn't drink coffee. He brings me lists like other men bring flowers. He told me to name four quiet things and it saved a door."

"Well," her father said, his mouth twitching like a man who is reluctantly impressed. "That is more useful than gladioli. Bring him to Loughborough and we will see how he handles the trains. If he rehearses a sentence before he speaks it at me, I will ask him if he needs oil."

After curry and the sort of television programme that teaches you to accept arguments between experts as if they were sport, she lay on his sofa with her socks off and listened to her father talk to the kettle as if that was how men keep themselves alive. She considered the words she had not used and the ones she had and decided she had done enough bravery for a Saturday. The drive back to the station after the Sunday dinner where old men in hats explained to her how to fix the town involved rain that had trained to be fog. The Washlands looked like a drowned plain in a dream, a kind of champagne of mist that made the lights look like fish. She put her bike away with wet hands and the building breathed as if grateful for her small competence.

The church Hawley promised her was worse than she imagined, better because of it. Old stone that made rain look like a decided thing; pews that had been polished by the backs of people with bigger wrists than modern ones; the tang of old singing times and mice. Father Michael had the shocky brightness of someone in a crisis who had decided charm is a tool. He wrung his hands as if he had been told to mime regret. Hawley shook his hand like a man shaking an object he intends to put down and forget. Kira crouched and peered behind things because that is where truth is. It was the candle nearest the icon with the face too kind to be believed. Candle plus curtain plus a wire hiding in the wrong place. Not an arsonist and not an accident, the category people hate, the one called "we put heat near cloth and went away".

She explained it as tenderly as she could to a man for whom tenderness would always be the measure of a woman. He consoled her that God had a plan for curtains, which is the sort of sentence that becomes a story if told by someone else later. At the back of the church a boy was stacking chairs with an efficiency that made Kira think of Elias, and she wanted to ask him if he had a list for this, too, but instead she took photographs with her fingers as frames and went home to write something that would not make Hawley say "poetry, knock it off". She put her report on his desk with proper nouns and straight edges and felt, childishly, like she had given a good gift to a teacher whose detachment was proof of affection.

On the second week she woke from a dream of the boathouse in which the absence had finally shut up about its guilt. In the dream she held a spanner in her left hand and a cup of coffee she wasn't going to drink in her right and she stood on a patch of concrete as if it were an island she owned. In the morning, in the grey that tastes of old paper, she tied the storm-coloured tie around the locker hook a little higher because the low placement had begun to look tragic even to her. She thought about learning to tie it around her own throat and wearing it under her tunic to see if anyone noticed the one ridiculous piece of elegance she had allowed into her life, and then pictured Gaz making a speech about the proletariat and laughed to herself until she was less in danger of doing it.

The call that made the newspaper that week had no beauty to flatter it. A house had lied about being asleep and killed a girl in the back bedroom because a plug had shouted at a carpet and no one had listened. Kira had done this job long enough to not cry in the hallway and not enough to not cry later, quietly in the ambulance bay, where rain obligingly made it look like weather. Faye sat next to her like a curtain. "Don't," she said, with the graceless sympathy of women who have had to learn to be fearsome and gentle simultaneously. "If you start I'll have to talk and if I talk I might make a joke and then I will hate myself for a week. Name four whatever that list is if it gives your mouth something to do."

"Four quiet," Kira said, because the word quiet was a thing she could hold without cutting herself. "The corner of the locker. The space under the bench. The steam in my own hair. The stupid next minute." They sat together until the minute became a little less stupid. Gaz appeared with tea made in the way that says love while calling it something else and put it by her foot. He looked like a boy whose dog had hurt itself and had decided to be brave for the dog's sake and she loved him for it in the mother-sister way she had never learned to name.

An email from Elias appeared later, over crispbread and anger. "I am being asked to be an answer," he wrote. "My skin is not a chalkboard. I am making small rebellions by naming the colour of cups and telling a man that he is not as tall as his voice thinks. I will not say sorry for not being where you are righteous. I am storing things up to bring back. They will call it data and I will present it as stories and we will both be told off for our poetry." She read it and, for once, did not reply, the way you don't greet an animal until it has sniffed your hand and a bit of your sleeve. Later she wrote "Nigel promoted to Manager" and a description of the way the Washlands smelled at seven a.m., which is one part cold mown grass, one part malt, one part grief. It was enough.

By the third Wednesday she had learned where the floorboards complained in the FI office and which file you had to open gently so its paper wouldn't fly out like birds relieved of cages. Hawley had a day where he was gentlemanly and she feared it because it presaged an ask. It did. He wanted her to go to a talk at the council, to stand at the back and be the shape of a firefighter in a room where men said "strategy" as if it were the name of a horse they had bet on. "If you stand very still," he said, ironically and with intention, "someone will think they've been heard. Don't make eye contact with the deputy. He will think you've joined his team and you'll be ordering a branded fleece before the end of the week." She stood very still and thought of Elias, and it felt both like theft and solidarity.

The council building had a painting of the river that made it look honest, which is not what the river is, and Kira watched a man with a good suit and a bad understanding explain resilience to a woman in shoes that were better than this room deserved. In the lobby, an old woman in a pink coat the colour of ham asked Kira if she could open her bottle of water because the cap had become her enemy. Kira did it and the woman said, "You have capable hands," with the simple delight of the satisfied, and Kira nearly laughed and nearly cried. On the way out she stopped in a corridor because the air changed in a way she knew now. The room where the good bench was had its door open. She peered and then stepped inside like a person stepping into an empty church to check if she still knows how to sit quietly.

The bench was there. So was a box on the table, white card, tied with string, a twin to the one she had seen months ago and tried not to turn into a metaphor. The string had been tied by someone who understands the aesthetics of knots, a thing only sailors and people in institutions master. She didn't touch it. She did an unwise thing and opened the window, which was not a window but a panel that pretended. Air from the river wandered in like a badly trained dog, went out again because the room had more opinions than space. She sat and put her hands on her knees and said to no one in particular, "I am not writing a name. This is not an incantation. This is a seat," and stayed until the creep of someone else's footsteps in the corridor made her remember that rooms are never as private as we wish.

On the way back she texted Faye a picture of the worst moustache in the council building and was rewarded with a stream of emojis that had the same determination as hose. She put her phone away and walked past the noticeboard where the caretaker pinned the important and the absurd with the same tidy malice. There was an advert for Pilates and a warning about scooters and a note, in printing so precise it made her think of rulers, that said "Do not move the mannequins without permission," and she thought of the hand in tissue, the wrist seam, the neatness of a tie. She told herself that curiosity is a poor diet and took the stairs two at a time because her legs were still loyal.

There was a house on Anglesey Road that taught her nothing new and frightened her anyway. A dehumidifier and bad wiring, the sort of white goods betrayal that turns into grief if you aren't allowed to be angry at the object. The woman in the doorway had that stunned exactness of someone whose life has been decluttered without consent. Kira did the patient detective work in the smell of mould and resignation and wrote down the model number of a machine that had never wanted to be known. Later, at the station, Gaz put a pan of something that could have been soup on the hob and forgot it and the smell of nearly was enough to send both women in the room sliding across the floor to attend to it like they were practicing a drill no one would praise them for. Afterward, Faye looked at Kira and said, "We will laugh at this in our seventies," and Kira made a face because she did not plan to live a life where the present took so long to be funny.

One night, toward the end of the four weeks, she dreamed a dream she felt she might keep on purpose. She sat in a classroom with no walls, only board, and the board had on it not names but verbs. Stand. Breathe. Walk. Name. And someone in the corner of the room, who might have been her mother or might have been a version of herself with salt in her hair, said, "You could have been a dozen other animals. You picked this one. Feed it well." She woke with a resolve she mistrusted only a little. In the morning, she took the tie from the locker and learned to knot it badly in her kitchen, YouTube instructing her in a man's cheery voice that made the tie a friend. The knot sat at the base of her throat like a dare. She wore it under her work shirt to the FI office, which was ridiculous and comfort, and Hawley didn't notice until lunch, when he squinted like a church gargoyle and said, "Did you get married and not invite me," and she told him she and a list had eloped and he grunted as if to say he'd have liked to object, theatrically and fruitlessly.

The day he came back, she didn't write his name on anything. She went to the room with the bench because habit is a path and sometimes it gets you where you meant to go even if you don't admit you set out. She opened the door and he was there, hands at his sides, face a degree less pale and an inch more human. The cut along his cheek had softened the way metal softens if you sand it for long enough. He looked at her and then at the tie and the smile he made had enough asymmetry in it to make it credible. He didn't speak first, which was a new kind of courtesy. She said, "I learned to tie a knot," and he said, "I learned to drink water and to pretend I like rooms that hum," and they stood and watched each other for a breath and then a handful more as if they had agreed to measure time this way so that later, if someone took the minutes off them, they would still have these.

"I went somewhere with rules like teeth," he said finally, his voice not an apology because that makes a habit of itself if you let it. "They asked me to be the map. I reminded them that maps do not walk. It annoyed men who think maps are for other men. I stood. I stood so well they gave me a chair, which is the reward in rooms like that, and I gave it to someone else and we both got told off. I brought you something that looks like contraband. It is not. You are allowed to own it. I would have put a bow on it but then it would blush."

She put her hands out because she had learned to ask. He handed her a book thinner than seriousness and thicker than pity, its silkily absurd American cover promising to teach her how to read heat without taking herself too seriously. Underlined sentences had been underlined with a ruler. There were marginalia in a careful hand that did not belong to the man in front of her and she knew it all the same. "For when walls are louder than people," he'd written on the front flyleaf, and underlined louder once because he was not a woman and didn't yet understand how underlines can shout. She took it as if it might balance the part of her that felt like it was always leaning.

They didn't go to Nigel because Nigel was off and she could not bear to introduce this happiness to the boy who tamped wrongly. They walked along the river with their hands doing nothing that would embarrass either of them and spoke about bad electrics and good dogs and the way the light on water makes everyone forgive even the river. He told her about a woman in a training room who had taught him how to say no without moving any part of her face, and she told him about a candle that wasn't innocent and a thumbprint on a lie. He laughed in that gentle key that makes a vowel attractive. She watched his mouth and forgave herself.

They parted at the corner where bleach and bakery shared a smell and he put his hand up in that careful way of men and machines taught to anticipate flinching. She did not flinch. She said, "Four cold," and he said, "Four warm," and between them it was either prayer or routine; she didn't care so long as she could walk the rest of the way home without the street insisting on names for things she wasn't ready to baptize. In the night, the river was noisy because spring had decided at last to be lazy and give itself to summer, and Kira could sleep with the window open and listen to the town like a person breathing on a pillow.

On Friday, because the world rarely lets you have two of the same kind of day in a row, they were called to an elderly care home where a toaster had become a tyrant. The staff were kindness with hands and little patience for electrics. Kira put it out with the sort of competence that makes no good photo and then, while waiting for the smoke to leave a lounge that had been arranged for loneliness to be neat, a woman in a cardigan the colour of old pistachios took Kira's wrist with the proprietary grip of someone who no longer believes in politeness and said, "My husband was a fireman. He slept like a crime scene. You sleep better than he did."

"Not so far as you'd notice," Kira said, smiling because insults are a form of affection when delivered like that.

"Bring me the one with the tie next time," the woman said, and Kira didn't ask how or why; old women know more than anyone and have decided to stop explaining. She promised absurdly and when the woman let go, Kira stood very still for a minute and let it shine in her like a joke she was too fond of to share.

When the week turned into itself again, she told herself properly, aloud, as she put her kit away and aligned the mug with the mug hook because alignment has become a way to be free, that she could stand. She had stood in rooms that wanted to sit her down and done arithmetic with heat. She had tried on a tie and found it only mostly ridiculous. She had loved a person in a way that was almost like learning to read again. Part of her was underlined twice. Part of her would always be a footnote. She could be a page and still turn. Outside, the river told a small, new joke to the bank. Inside, the station lights made that hum that is two notes, one high, one lower, and if you stood still enough for long enough you could hum along and hear your own breath relay it back.Spring pretended it would last forever and Kira pretended she believed it. The Washlands did their impression of the sea; the paths remembered the idea of being dry; the river put its shoulder into the town with affection. You could smell cut grass and hop steam and the electricity hiding in clouds even on days without thunder. At the station there was a list on the noticeboard that had not existed in winter: a rota for ice-lollies that someone had written in a faux medieval script and then underlined twice when Naylor pretended not to see it. Kira ran in the mornings until sweat made the small of her back honest and she allowed herself to put her hands on her knees and watch swans bully everything that didn’t have the decency to glide.

She did the FI Wednesdays as if she were learning a foreign alphabet and didn’t yet know where the vowels hid. Hawley had adopted the underhanded gentleness of a man who has decided you are worth his best bad manners. He thumped reports onto her desk and told her to read them backwards; he handed over photographs grainy as a memory and said, “Speak like a detective, not a poet,” and looked pleased and aggrieved when she did both. She learned the weight of different cheap plastic, how one brand of extension lead fails with the spite of an ex, how dried flowers fixed with hair spray are lovely until they are accelerant. She wrote lists that were not his and not Elias’s, shy little things on index cards like: three places you could kneel in this room and still breathe; five objects the dead would have moved if they’d had half a second longer. On jobs she kept her mouth shut until they were back at the van, and then said a sentence or two and watched it turn into work.

On a warm Wednesday when a cloud learnt the trick of being a bruise and moved slowly across town, she sent her father a message that read, without preface, Bring your politest face Saturday. She added, There will be trains, as if that could excuse anything. His reply came back with a swiftness that meant he had been waiting to be asked for something: I own one face. It is punctual. She did not ask Elias like a girl in a book with a ribbon. She wrote, in that neat almost-brusque way they had learned, Loughborough Saturday? Museum and timetables and my father. You will endure it. If you don’t I will forgive you late. He wrote back, Yes and yes and I am very good at enduring. He added, observably, Tell him I can count headcodes, which meant he had done research, which meant he was nervous, which made her briefly dizzy with fondness and pity.

They met at Burton station under a board that had taught itself to be apologetic and took a train that hissed like a kettle that couldn’t do anything else. In the carriage she watched him through their reflection and understood that her eyes had learned a new grammar. He wore a suit not so new it demanded a christening, not so old it wept. He had picked a tie with no bruise in it. He sat with his hands arranged as if he had been taught to be persuasive without moving. When he looked out of the window it was like watching a man receive information by osmosis. She thought of the seam at his wrist and had the faint, wicked thought that her father would like him because he looked like a thing that could be mended.

Her father was on the platform in a shirt he believed made him look taller and a jacket he had owned since a different Labour government. His face did that movement of arranging and then relaxing and then performing surprise badly. He shook Elias’s hand like testing a tool for balance. There was a silence that was not empty but a corridor, and then her father said, as if offering a fruit, “Fifty-one twenty-two to Quorn at ten past, if they’ve not disgraced themselves,” and Elias said, exactly serious, “The 9F will do it in twelve if the driver is vain,” and her father laughed, once, the bright bark of a man who has been startled and likes it.

They walked the Great Central platforms and her father told stories that had been polishing themselves inside him for years. He pointed at signals with the pride of a man pointing out his own children in a school play. He said “headcode” as if it were and was a word that improved a day just by being in it. Steam rolled along the platform and made everyone’s hair look like ideas. The engine nose came in like a cathedral being helpful. A child with a flag took her job so seriously Kira wanted to hand her a pension book. Elias stood with his hands at his sides as if letting gravity have its say, and his face performed attention at a pitch that would have flattered a prime minister. Her father asked a question about braking curves that would have defeated most people at this table, and Elias answered with a sentence that did not show off and was right, and the line at Kira’s father’s mouth softened into an acceptance he would not admit to until he had a beer.

They had curry in the place her father liked because the naan stretched like reason and the waiter remembered him and their devotion to the old menu. Her father asked Elias what he did and Elias said “I teach people how to watch heat,” which made her father nod like a man in a pub nodding at a good argument. Her father watched Elias not drink water with the kind of attention that pretends to be benign and is. He noticed the carefulness of the tie and the fact that Elias did not take his jacket off even when the room suggested it. He noticed the particular way Elias laughed, half past politeness, as if humour was a language he understood and had only recently been permitted to speak.

They walked back through the station and on the footbridge a woman sat down in a decision rather than a fall. She put a flat hand on the wood as if making a deal with it. Elias stepped forward without stepping into anyone’s space. He crouched in a sudden, precise hinge of knee and said something in a voice Kira had not heard him use, a voice which was neither classroom nor river bank, and put his palm on the bench near the woman’s hand rather than on it. He made the shape of offering your body as furniture. The woman breathed like a train beginning again and did the thing women do when presented with a person-shaped space to pour the worst thirty seconds of their day into: she did it, and it cost her nothing, and it helped. Kira’s father watched, head tilted in that way that made him look like a critical sparrow, and said, a minute later, as if addressing no one, “He stands very still,” which was his way of saying: he will do.

On the platform, while a steam engine whooped like a show-off and made a boy clap involuntarily, Kira felt that her life was a room she could live in rather than a hallway she had to keep crossing. Her father, later, at his kitchen table with the radio tuned to the exact wrong frequency for his temperament, said, “He is a handsome liar,” and when she bristled he added, before she could marshal outrage, “All men are. He lies about sleeping and he lies about thirst and he lies about wear when he is worn. He told me the truth about trains. He told you the truth about standing. I can live with that combination. I will not call him son-in-law and you may punch me for even having let the noun in my mouth. But if he puts you down as if you are heavy and he is tired, tell me. I will make him a timetable he cannot satisfy.”

Back in Burton, the lakey light that had given the town a holiday for a week went off like a switch. Rain came properly again and the roads remembered their other profession. On the FI desk there was a series of printouts from a case that looked boring until it wasn’t: four small fires in flats within a mile as if a person had got off a bus and got off again and again. All were shallow burns. All had poor houses in common and a smell on the air that said someone had boiled something they shouldn’t. Kira circled “candles” with a pen and Hawley frowned and then lifted the corner of his mouth into a concession and said, “The mean kind. We’ll go knock on doors. Bring your eyebrows. Leave your pity at home. We can collect it later.”

At the fourth flat a woman let them in with the simultaneous apology and contempt women in poor housing have perfected. She had hair like a war story. She had three plates and a kettle that looked like a weapon. Kira crouched and looked at the shape under the table. A melted puddle of something that had once been a scoop. Tea-light trays in the sink, six, seven, more. She imagined a man with a cheap lighter doing something with ritual while the television whined in the corner. There was a sick little bed of wax in the slub of the carpet. Kira stood and felt the familiar anger that wanted to be useful and would have to settle for accurate. They asked soft questions and wrote hard notes. They left with a name someone had said in a tone that meant: I am tired of him but he buys bread.

The call everyone talked about was the one under the bridge. A barge had been over-hopeful with its warnings and a company had loaded optimism into blue drums with white caps and sent the lads off with their sandwiches and their prayers. Someone smoked. Someone didn’t look. There was a puff, the wrong sort. The Washlands watched. Fire loved solvents because anything that pretends to be cold and is not deserves punishment. The river took the light like a thief. The radio did that voice it saves for adjacencies between men in different coats. Kira dressed and wasn’t aware of herself doing it. Faye said, “We should have stayed at school,” and put her hair up again for luck. Gaz made the sign of the cheap saint with the two fingers men think they invented. Connor made an oath of his chin strap without knowing.

On the bank, everyone pretended the river was their friend. The plume was not tall but it was nasty. It tasted medicinal and cheap and like summer. There were men with clipboards and men with flags and one woman in a suit with a face that looked like it could silence a foghorn. The barge hunched under the bridge like a delinquent. Kira felt the hum of steel through the soles of her boots the way she had learned to feel things since the card had been tacked to her locker, and she went down the steps to the water the way you approach a dog that might bite and might kiss.

There were drones that had opinions. One of them hovered like a cross thought. There was a man with a joystick and the sort of concentration that makes you want to cough. The drone dipped and the crowd made that involuntary noise English people make when things happen in public. Kira said, because her mouth often did triage before her brain, “If we do it while the bridge is still humble we can forgive ourselves later,” and the water unit thanked her for the sentence and used it. Hose does not like solvent fires. Water is an argument you can win only if you get the grammar right. She named four cold, out loud because the mask meant no one would know she was talking to herself: the water near the bow; the wet ring on the river wall; the metal steps; the pump casing they had bullied into place. Four warm: the underside of the bridge where anger collects; the plastic cap that hadn’t agreed to stay; the rope taut and petty; the little bit of breath inside her mask that belonged to her and no one else. Four loud: the hum in the bridge; the drone pretending; Gaz inventing new vowels; the river doing its shoulder. Four quiet: the three inches under the belly of the barge you could see if you lay on your side and believed in physics; the inside of the hose when no one asked it anything; the negative space where men who were not here would be complaining; the part of her that was prepared to accept that luck is sometimes competence in a borrowed coat.

Then there was the other noise, not hum, not river, not drone; the crowd’s hum went sideways for a second like a flock turning. He was on the path, out of coat, hands at his sides, so still the air seemed to take a step back to accommodate him. Part of her insisted: you conjured this, you witch with your chalk and your shame. The other part said: of course he is here; he is the sort of person who stands near bridges when bridges need being looked at. He did not come down. He watched in a way that felt like work. Someone else watched him. A man with the face of a weeknight administrator and the badge of a man who had earned it in rooms with old men and new money stood two metres behind, and his attention was the sort that scuffs furniture. Kira didn’t have time to decide what to do with this tableau because the barge did a small shudder and the cap on a drum died without a funeral.

They got it out insofar as anyone gets anything out on a river. The bridge did not take offence and fall. The river did not decide to be perfect and kill someone to make its point. The drone landed as if tired. Back on the bank the air smelled like science. Kira peeled her hood back and said something rude to gravity and felt suddenly the total weight of herself as a fact. She looked up to the path to make a joke with her face in case the men with badges needed to learn, and saw that he had gone and in his place was only an ordinary shadow and the administrator with the badge, who inclined his head at Kira as if she had done something like her job and he disapproved of how much she seemed to enjoy it.

She found him later in a room that pretended to be an office when it was mostly a cupboard with ambitions. Not the bench room; a different place, nearer the guts of the building. There were shelves with stacked folded things and a fluorescent frankness to the light that made skin honest. A box on the table was open in the affronted way packages are when they have been interrupted. Inside was an upper torso, if you were going to be precise and she always was: skin the colour of default plasteness, nipple like a joke for medical students. There were wrists in tissue, pale, pale, nails trimmed with an almost feminine correctness. Elias stood beside it with his jacket off, and Kira saw something she had not seen laid bare. There was an absence of hair where hair should immodestly have made its case. There were small, viciously neat sockets where flesh had consented to hardware.

He did not look ashamed and he did not look proud. He looked like a man in a shirt being fitted. He looked like a problem that had chosen its own solution. The administrator stood at the door with his hands behind his back like a prefect who had learned nothing since primary school. He nodded to Elias in the sort of politeness that thinks it can be mistaken for friendship and said, to Kira, “You have five minutes,” in the voice people use when they are testing whether you will ask why and they are ready to be delighted by their refusal.

Kira wanted, for one barbarous second, to say, “Get out.” She wanted to put her body between Elias and the flattering light. She wanted to put the box on the floor and sit on it like a child hoarding treats. She did none of those things. She went to the table and looked him in the face so as not to trespass on the piece of him that could be detached and put away. He smiled with that careful calibration she had learned to read like an instrument. It was not made for her and it was, and she took what was true and left what wasn’t.

“Does it hurt,” she said, because that was the only thing that mattered and it was solidarity and rudeness and she could not help herself.

“It doesn’t,” he said, so simply that the administrator made a small, bored sound with his throat as if he had heard this answer a thousand times. “It is sometimes strange, and that is not the same. The skin object to be removed is a project my mind dislikes. I would rather not watch. They will do it as quickly as they remember they can. I will go back in one piece. There is a smear,” and he lifted his chin towards his cheek, where a line had lengthened as if it had been told a joke and stretched into indulgence, “which is the sort of thing that makes men like him,” he inclined his head toward the administrator in a movement so slight that even the light didn’t bother to follow it, “itch to fix.”

Kira, because she couldn’t stop with one rude question, asked another. “What name do you have in rooms like this,” she said. “Is it your name. Or do they give you a number like a locker.”

“I have many names like rain,” he said. “Their favourite is platform. Sometimes asset. When they are sentimental, Elias. When they are angry, Elias. When they want to remind themselves I am not a man, they change the way they say man. I think I have patriot as a word in a file, which sits ill with me because it is a banner and I was intended to be furniture. On forms I am staff. In the mornings I am something that wakes without sleeping. With you I am an object of study,” and his smile tilted, self-cruel, “but the nice kind.”

“Not study,” she said, and it came out a little harsh. “Curiosity. Admiration. Want. I am learning to use words as if they were not knives. I fail. I want to put my hand on the place where they open you and ask it forgiveness for having to be a door. They don’t get to have you in a way that takes you away. I understand that this is the world. I would like to change it. I am not special. I am a person who is going to cry later and will do it after I have asked if you need tea.”

He ducked his head very slightly in that motion that never stopped being a dancer’s relic. “No tea,” he said. “Bring me the name of the solvent that was, because it is rude to leave it without the dignity of being called. Bring me a list of your cold things. Bring me your father’s scorn in a jar. He will be useful if I am ever permitted to be in a room where usefulness is not a word that bruises. I will come back. Stop writing my name for a week or it will become superstition and you will hate yourself,” and that last line did a cruel, kind thing to her and she laughed because there was no other reflex left that wouldn’t turn her to glass.

On the way out, the administrator said, in a tone that tried for pity and achieved fence, “You people always think there is a love story, and there is not. There is work and the politics of work and I would prefer not to have to stand between you and it. You can help me not stand between the two by consenting to normal procedures. He is—valuable,” and he gestured at the table as if to suggest value could be printed on a label and tied to a wrist.

Kira stopped, half-turned like a woman who might change her mind and walk back and set the room on fire, and said, with more politeness than she knew she was capable of, “You can speak to me like that when you’ve dragged a man out of a hallway with your breath turned into a counting song and your hands cold enough to become a science. Until then, I recommend ‘please’ and ‘thank you.’ I am fond of him not because he is valuable to your rooms, but because he has the kind of manners that make the world forgive itself for ten minutes at a time. He is not furniture. He is not your story. He may be my poem and I may be a woman who despises poems. I can hold contradictions. Can you.”

The administrator did not move a muscle. Kira left before her mouth betrayed how much she had enjoyed saying something unwise in a building where unwise talk might be recorded by the very walls.

She went home and the rain put its hands on the glass and the kettle breathed like her mother. She sat on the floor and put her back against the couch and named four cold without needing help: the corner of the room where spiders have jurisdiction; the tile under the sink that refuses to be warm no matter what the heating suggests; the butter knife with no sensation of duty; the tie on the hook. Four warm: her own throat; the patch of carpet the sun had decided to keep for the hour; the small round of heat the laptop left; the place on her arm where his name had lived without chalk for a week. Four loud: Faye’s message arriving and failing to be a bird; the river sulking because it had been told off publicly; the radiators discovering pluralities of expansion; her heartbeat when she thought of the wrist seam. Four quiet: the breath under the fridge that might be loneliness; the space between the words of the sentence she had said to the administrator; the Weight of the chair in the bench room; the bit of her that refused to want and had lost.

The next day she went to work and did her list of mortal chores. They rolled hose because the world needed its muscles; they cleaned masks because breath is not to be taken for granted; they looked at the sky because weather has become a personality. Hawley texted a single word, “Ethyl,” which would have been cryptic if she had not wanted a solvent so badly. She wrote “ethanol” in her notebook for dignities and drew four cold, four warm in the corner and pretended she had not done it for luck.

There was a week of smallness, the sort of week that convinces you you are safe because nothing big happens and then at three a.m. there is a knock at your narrative. Kira did school visits and watched children ask if fire ever got bored and answered “yes, and then it causes trouble” in her cheery register. She went with Hawley to a bungalow where a man had hung fairy lights in a way that made electricity feel like a story that had been badly edited. She helped a woman pack a box of framed photographs while the woman tried not to cry about the two that had been lost to heat and pretended she was furious with the frames first because fury is easier to tidy away than grief. She ran along the Washlands slowly enough to notice a pair of teenagers practicing nonchalance and very bad French kissing. She stopped at Nigel’s and found Nigel with a bandage on his paw and the blue-haired girl replaced by a tall boy with eyes haunted by tamping and an apron that said “Assistant Assistant Manager.” She told him he tamped too hard and he confessed he knew and they both felt better for the honesty.

When he came back it was not like a triumphant return. It was like a day being replaced by another day that happened to move differently. He texted nothing. He stood at the corner where bleach and bakery is the air and lifted his hand and she saw the seam again because she had learned how to look. They went to the room with the bench because rooms get to be characters once you give them something to hold and this one had their shape in it. He said, “The man has been sent to a different building,” and she did not ask which man. He said, “I have been given a card that if presented means I can leave a room without being asked why for seven minutes,” and he showed it to her like a boy with a ticket to a fair. She wrote four names on a scrap of paper—Naylor, Hawley, Faye, Dad—and handed it to him and said, “If in seven minutes you need a civilian to say something that changes the shape of a rule, pick one of these and hand them a sentence. Don’t pick Faye unless you want the plaster to learn new swear words,” and he folded the paper into a pocket with care because care is a religion they had both written their names in.

They walked the river. The geese had moved their goslings across the path with the entitlement of aristocrats and Nigel, who had decided to take the air, watched and did not intervene. Kira told him about the woman with the pistachio cardigan and what she had said about sleep, and he said, with a seriousness that didn’t feel like theatre, “People assume we can rest when told. It is not so. My off is your on with the volume down. I am learning to pad my off with ritual that looks like sleep. I refuse to call what I do while you sleep ‘storage.’ It has the wrong ethics.”

She said, because she wanted to give him a thing that wasn’t duty, “My father likes you,” and watched his face move through a set of human permissions and land on something self-conscious and pleased.

He said, “He will not tell me that for some time,” and she said, “Of course not,” and they both laughed that private laugh of people who have learned to translate each other in the way you translate weather: with metaphors and trust.

When she told Faye, in the noisy safety of the mess, the parts that could be told, Faye put her head dramatically on the table and said, “You are in a romance with a handsome dishwasher,” and Kira said, “He’s more of an oven,” and Faye said, “Men who can heat a room but don’t eat cake are useless,” and Kira laughed and let herself be teased until the bubble of fear subsided. Gaz tried the tie on and declared himself posh and Connor said, “Do we have to start saluting,” and Naylor, overhearing, said, “You can salute me if you fix the leak by bay three,” which was his way of saying he saw and was not going to make it a thing.

The next live fire was ugly, not big or showy, but eager to hurt: a stairwell in a council block with someone’s godawful varnish and someone else’s cruelty. The heat did its chimney act and would have taken the building if the building had been less stubborn. Kira went up with Gaz and found a woman on the second landing who had made herself into a punctuation mark of refusal, hands flat on the lino, shoes at funny angles, yelling the sort of coherent panicked nonsense people yell when they have remembered they love their own skin. Kira did the thing with her legs and did the four quiet without noticing she had done it, the “sh,” the hush she made with her throat for herself and for the air that wanted to be sucked out of the world. They did it. They did their job. Later she sat on the step outside and looked at her hands and the chalk dust that wasn’t there and grieved the absence like a superstition.

The chapter she had not admitted she was writing in her head had a moment in it she could not stop turning: a conversation with Elias that refused to happen in rooms and insisted on being had in the open, under the sound-track of the river and the factories breathing in their dignified way. When it came, it came because she made it. They met on the little footbridge where duckweed makes a continent and teenagers make a theatre when the light is kind. She had two sentences in her mouth like difficult pills and they had to be swallowed at once or not at all.

“I love you,” she said, so ordinary she shocked herself with her own failure to be tidy. “I don’t need you to take ownership of that sentence or to put it in a safe. I need you to know it because it is shaping my days and because I am in charge of naming things in my rooms and you are one of the rooms. I do not want salvage. I am not floor. I am asking to stand next to you when men tell you ‘storage’ and you tell them no, and when you cannot say no and they must do their work I will not leave. I will not weep at you. I will let my emotion cause you no extra labour. I will be angry on my own. I will be proud on my own. I will make you tea. I will say your name on a board when I must. I will write my own first when I can. You do not have to love me back. I will not break if you don’t, but you will lose your place on the bench and the bench is good.”

He had prepared no sentences. She watched the struggle of the pause and had mercy. It hurt; it was a pleasure to show kindness to a pause. He said, finally, eyes not on her mouth because that would have been a cruelty, “I love you in a way that frightens the men who built me because they did not intend the word for me and in a way that frightens me because I understand that the duty it carries is not the duty they intended either. I am little and large in the wrong proportions. I will go and be worth nothing to rooms that say ‘deploy’ and then I will come back to this town that smells of beer and flood and kettles and I will stand. I will not touch you as much as you might deserve because touch has become a political act in my rooms and I am thick with rules and I would like to learn your kindness to pauses. I will tell you when I cannot stand. I disapprove of the word ‘break’ for myself; I am not crockery. If a part is removed you will not be expected to help put it back, but if you are in the room and wish to hold a wrench I will not say no. I am built and I will give you the hands you want for your metaphors. I will drink coffee if Nigel insists and I have been practising with glasses of water and praise.”

They did not hug because hugging would have turned this into a poster. They did not kiss because kissing is a narrative that wants to claim you for itself. They put their forearms against the railing and leaned and looked at the water as if it were saying something they would like to agree with and had not yet decided if it was sincere. The river did its sucking at the bank. A dog barked at something only the dog recognized as crime. It was almost simple.

When she went home, she took the chalk stub from the cup by the kettle and put it in her pocket. She wrote, because she sometimes wrote things for no audience but the day, a list she would never show Hawley and would never email to anyone and would keep under the fridge magnet where no one looked unless searching for dropped spoons. Four truths. Water runs away when it can. Fire tells on itself if you get close enough to hear. People are better when you hand them something. I will stand. Four lies. I can do this alone. He doesn’t drink because he wants to look well-mannered. The war on the telly isn’t ours. Chalk is only chalk. She put the list away because rituals are better when they don’t ask to be admired.

The next morning the gulls elbowed the sky again and the tyres hissed and the kettle did its opera and her father’s train news on the radio sounded like a litany. She answered the pager when it called and rolled, not elegantly, but on time, and at Nigel’s later she said to the Assistant Assistant Manager that he tamped with the weight of a grudge and he said he had broken up with his girlfriend and she said “Use less arm,” and he said “Of course,” and for a moment the whole town seemed possible. In the afternoon she went to the college, to a room with a board, and wrote two names in a hand nobody else could see: Kira, and then, after a breath, Elias, underlined both once, and left them there to stop her own superstition turning into a collar. When she closed the door, the corridor hummed its two notes—one high, one low—and she sang along in her throat because sometimes you need to hear yourself as a tuning fork. The bench waited, the river told a joke, the breweries breathed out their hot bread happiness, and Kira went to work on the numbers that have to be turned into stories before they injure anyone else.
