I grew up with the sound of birds I couldn’t see. In Sacramento, dawn came on like a faucet, suddenly noisy, water and light gushing through old pipes. Even the air on Stockton Boulevard had a way of sounding. The buses hissed and sighed, the palm fronds clicked like teeth. On the mornings when the heat lifted early, a thin delta breeze combed through the wires and made them sing. But under that, there was always one note that found me, pulled me out of sleep as if with a hooked finger. I’d be drifting in the small room above the laundromat and then—shrill, serrated, old as the dirt—koh-ree-ah, koh-ree-ah.

I jerked up, blanket twisted around my waist, lungs already empty. It wasn’t even the same bird. It couldn’t be. The neighbor down on 42nd Street had a backyard flock and the roosters were feuding, their calls braided and bright, stabbing at the soft part under my ribs. It didn’t matter. My body didn’t know the difference between memory and morning.

I counted to six. I used to be able to count to ten, but lately the numbers didn’t feel like a ladder anymore. Six was all I could keep in my head without getting mad at the sequence, angry that it kept moving up and never latched. The crows on the roof fidgeted. I heard the first washing machines tumble on below me, the click of the owner’s keys in the back door. I slid my legs over the side of the mattress and sat for a moment with my toes on the cold floor, staring hard at the wall as if a hole would open and let me climb through it.

“You could just learn to love it,” Birdie said the first time I told her. “Turn it into your ringtone.” She said it with a mouth full of French fry, winking like it was a kindness.

I stood at the greasy pass in the diner, flipping plates under the heat lamps, the order tickets warping along their metal rail. “I can’t explain it,” I said. “My blood stands up. It goes all wrong.”

Birdie shrugged and kicked the back door out with her heel so she could smoke. She wore those red plastic heart earrings that made her look like a valentine in a fight. She also wore a name tag with a name that wasn’t hers. That’s what she said, anyway. Collecting names like bus tickets. “You don’t have to explain anything,” she said. “I was just joking. Baby.”

Behind us, the cook we called Uncle Ned—who probably was not anyone’s uncle, maybe not even Ned—rattled a skillet on the burner, his forearm tattoo writhing in the steam. The tattoo was a snake, I think. Or a river. He didn’t say much except when the grill flared up. Then he cursed like a sailor out of a comic book, all black dots and POWs.

Sometimes, when the rooster in the neighbor’s yard tore open the morning and my heart went shivering into its corners, I would say Birdie’s words back to myself. Learn to love it. An experiment. Lipstick my fear with a sweeter color. It didn’t work, but it gave me something to try.

On the days I worked lunch, I walked down Stockton and cut over to Broadway. Past the pawn shop with the neon guitar, past the wig store that had one blue mannequin in the window, past the church with its “God is Not Mad” sign half burned out so it read “God is Not.” I kept my hands in the pockets of my jacket even when it was too hot for a jacket. If I kept my fingers pushing against the rough seams, if I felt that pull of cotton, I could find the sidewalk again.

You wouldn’t expect roosters in the city. You expect sirens and someone yelling at someone else on their phone and the way a shopping cart sounds when it’s being dragged sideways. But Sacramento has teeth in its gums. It remembers farms. In backyards, behind fences patched with old mattress springs and carpet pads, there were birds. The law said no roosters, only hens. People worked around it the way they worked around other things. Construction sites and curfews and grief.

The first time a rooster made me bleed, I was ten. The orphanage wasn’t an orphanage, technically—just a house with a nonprofit name and a lady who didn’t like shoes on her rugs. I called it an orphanage anyway because that made it sound like everyone agreed I was missing something, and I liked the crispness of that. It was in Oak Park and the paint on the porch was forever in the peeling middle of a job. Sister Eileen wasn’t a sister of anything. Not a nun, not a mother, not the softer kind of sister you get sometimes from the world when it feels like doing you a favor. She wore white sneakers and a necklace made out of polished stones. When she smiled, it was as if she had to show each tooth individually to the light.

He came over the fence like a thrown scarf. Red and green and a cockscomb like a soft crown that made you want to touch it. He eyed us. He had gold in his feathers. We had a jar of cracked corn from a woman down the street who kept rabbits that had multiplied into a riot. After school, we’d scatter the corn and see who came. The squirrels came. The sparrows came. The old cat next door drifted through like a piece of evening that had gone astray. When the rooster jumped down into the yard, his feet hit hollow, like someone knocking under the floor. I felt that all through my hands.

“Hey, King,” Rowan said. He was two years older than me and always had himself arranged right, collar even, hair as if he’d counted it. He liked to build things with rubber bands. Bridges and catapults, tiny chairs that would collapse if you stared at them too long. He had a set of plastic yellow wings he swore would fly if we could find the correct angle to run off the porch. “Welcome to your new domain.”

I didn’t have a word for how he made me feel back then. It was like he was a coin spinning on a table. One face, then the other. He smiled and I got warm. He spoke and I checked the date on every decision I’d ever made.

The rooster’s eye was more dawn than it should have been. He had a throat like a fist and I watched it swell. The sound came out like it hated air. In an instant he was not a bird, he was a blade. He came up off the ground, he aimed, he knew. His feet hit my shin—I can still feel the exact place, that notch in the bone—and scratched down, dragging the earth into my blood. I didn’t cry. I mean, in the second. Then I cried as if crying was an occupation I’d trained for.

“It’s a rooster,” Sister Eileen said, coming out with a dishtowel in her hand, shaking water off it like she had just washed her wrists of us. “This is a rooster. They do that. It’s not about you.”

“It is about me,” I whispered, but not to her.

Rowan watched me with his head tilted, like I was doing something interesting he had never seen before. “She can’t even take a bird,” he told the sky. “What will she do with the big things. Like earthquakes.” He said it soft, for both of us. He smiled to let me know he liked me.

That scar never went away. Far later, when I got the courage to wear shorts in summer, there it would be, a little ladder on my shin where nothing grew right. My blood had learned a path early and kept it. If I could have told it to change, I would have. I could promise you that.

Sometimes I forgot the city is not a person. The river looks like a spine and the Tower Bridge looks like shoulders. The evening collects at the stomping grounds of the old train lines and the cranes by the railyards stand quiet as if they are listening for something you can’t hear unless you’re huge. I talked to buildings. Also turtles. I talked to the sign outside Jim-Denny’s and told it that it had survived, which was an accomplishment. I talked to houses because someone had done that for me once—spoke to me like I was a structure that had not yet finished and would creak into her destiny if someone was patient with the nails. When nobody was on the street, or it felt that way, I said hello to the palm trees and pretended they were a row of queens holding up the sky.

On a Tuesday, there were tomatoes that tasted like their own origin story stacked in the window of the market where you could buy bread so warm it burned your fingers. I wanted to go in and kneel down and bury my face in the bins and be a person with total normal needs: salt, olive oil, red fruit. I had three dollars and some nickels.

“Go in,” Hector said. “What’s the point of being poor if you don’t have poetry?” He had a way of chinning his cigarette like an old film star. “And for god’s sake take off that jacket. It’s not 1972. It’s not Boise.”

I didn’t feel like explaining Boise to him. I didn’t feel like explaining myself in any direction. “You gonna loan me two dollars?”

Hector made a show of patting his pockets. He turned out their insides like tongues, and we both admired how thoroughly empty they were. “I have lint,” he said. “And one paperclip.”

I bought two soft rolls and ate them walking, tearing pieces so that my mouth was busy and my thoughts had to fight for space. I crossed under the freeway and into a part of town where the air smelled less like sugar frying and more like dirt warming. In the distance, at the edge of a field that had been a field for too long, a shape on a pole threw up its throat and screamed.

I froze. My hand mashed all the warmth out of the bread. My throat turned sideways in me.

It wasn’t a rooster. There was a hawk on the pole, calling for something I couldn’t give it. But birds bleed into each other in the ear. I was floating for a second. My feet came down and I kept walking.

At the diner, there is a clock shaped like a lemon that ticks like an apology. There are stools that spin slowly no matter how firmly you sit down. There is a smell at the back of the walk-in cooler that is not anything you could name. When the lunch rush dips, Birdie and I play this game with the coffee spoons where you flick them so they spin and you see who can stop theirs pointing at the customer with the biggest loneliness. It’s not an admirable game. But we are not in charge of the world. We do what we can with what we’ve got.

“Birdie,” I said, stacking the blue plates with a confidence I didn’t feel. “I think I’m going to move.”

“Into my van?” she said brightly. “We can braid each other’s hair until the tow truck comes.”

“No. Just… away from the rooster.”

Birdie sucked on her straw as if there were salt at the bottom of her drink. “You could talk to the neighbor. People do talk.”

My mouth twisted without asking permission. “I can’t even listen to myself. Who would I be convincing. I’m not… I don’t know.” I made a circle with my hands, like I was kneading something invisible. “I’m not the kind of person who wins, with this thing.”

“You can be that person,” she said. She sucked a bit of ice into her straw and spit it neatly into her palm. “Gross. Sorry. Habit.” She folded the ice into a napkin like it needed to be dressed. “I just mean, you can be something else than the thing that happened to you. You’re good at not staying where you are.”

“I’m still here.”

“Look at you,” she said, and to my horror, I did. I looked at my reflected face in the lacquer of the counter and thought of war. Or not war, something less honorable. A mess that kept getting up, limping back into the same room. I had freckles across the bridge of my nose like someone had thrown me a small constellation and I hadn’t known what to do with it. “You’re bright as a kitchen.”

The bell over the door made its lonely wedding sound and a group of people came in with a wave of the more expensive kind of cologne. “Afternoon,” I called, because I like to be pleasant. “Booth or counter?” I am good at pleasant. It’s a practiced handstand I can hold for longer than it looks.

They took the corner booth under the crooning Elvis clock and while I filled waters and thumped ketchup bottles from the rescue milk crate, I heard a voice at the end of the counter I knew in my bones. Deep, careful, amused.

“You’re still here,” he said, as if I had been hiding inside the napkin dispenser and he had finally pulled out a last paper edge and there I was, folded into an infinity.

“I live here,” I said without looking up.

“I guessed,” Rowan said. “I guessed you would do that.”

I lifted my eyes and immediately wanted to put them away. He looked like the kind of man who had been relevant to any room since he first learned about rooms. His jaw was still the hinge on a door that could swing open and hit you. He wore a shirt with small white squares and sleeves he had rolled just so. He looked like he had made things with his hands, then washed them. He sat like gravity was his friend.

“I don’t block the escalators,” he said. “I am not an idler. Can I have a coffee?”

“You can have a coffee,” I said. The pot was light; I tilted it anyway. “You didn’t return the T-square you borrowed,” I added. No hello, I know. This is how the past drips, stubbornly.

He laughed so small that it felt like a secret somebody else would have enjoyed. “You knew I wouldn’t.”

“That’s why I labeled it,” I said.

“It had your name on it. Your whole name. But did it say anything to me?” Rowan tilted the cup to inhale the steam. “No cupboards where you are,” he said, looking around. “Everything left out to shimmer.”

I hated the way I was curious about what he was here to take from me. Past plus time equals fresh. I had to remind myself of math. “Booth or counter?”

“Counter,” he said immediately. “I like to be able to see the door.” He put a folded piece of paper down on the Formica and patted it as if calming a small dog. “I’m visiting. Give me something with an egg on it.”

“Ned’s got a special,” I said, because people like when you say names as if they mean something. “Eggs in a frame. That’s where—”

“I know what it is,” he said softly. Not unkind. “I can recognize a frame.”

It turned out he was in town—or so he said—for two days only, to check on a project up by the airfield. He said it like he wasn’t supposed to say it. I imagined something with tarps and metal ribs and men in safety glasses who ate their sandwiches standing up. When I brought him his plate I saw that his hands were clean in the grooves. There are the hands that build things, and there are the hands that plan the building then hold microphones. I couldn’t tell anymore which his were.

“Has anyone told you it’s time to leave the city,” he said, halfway through his second egg. “Time to stop pretending the air is a personality.”

“People tell me things,” I said. “Then their mouths leave.”

“Hm.” He pressed a piece of toast into the yolk as if it might open an eye. “Still dramatic.”

It wasn’t fair that someone could reach past years like that and tap your kneecap and make your foot leap. “I am the least dramatic person you have ever met. I keep my face in a drawer when I’m not using it.”

He laughed for real then. The sound slid along the counter and got under the salt shakers. “I missed you,” he said. He folded his napkin and put it exactly under the knife. “I’m building something that will make you less sad. That’s all. Then I’ll stop bothering you.”

“I am not sad,” I lied, cleanly, like a person closing a door without using her hands.

When the lunch rush ended, he left exact change and the smallest scrap of paper under his cup. I turned it over with the tips of my fingers. On it was a line drawing of a bird. Not a rooster. The other kind of bird he would draw: the kind with long wings that lock, the kind that uses the sky like a road. In the corner, he had written the letter R. Or it could have been A. The line was quiet.

“Who was that,” Birdie asked, coming up behind me so close that my elbow felt like a bell. “He looks like he doesn’t finish movies.”

“I don’t know,” I said, and it curved my whole body to say it. “Nobody.”

After the dinner shift, I walked aimlessly toward the river. The heat lay down and then got up again. The cicadas made their machine noise as if they were trying to repair the afternoon. At the top of the levee, the grass felt like an old costume. I could see the brown water sliding as if it had somewhere to be. Boats cut through it, exactly where boats always cut through water. The Ziggurat on the far side of the river looked like a little cake someone had forgotten to frost. It was the hour when everything was a different color to itself.

I didn’t plan to go to the night market. I turned and there it was, strings of bulbs like they were making a low sky for those of us who couldn’t find the real one. The chatter rose and floated sideways. I was good for about ten minutes, smiling at jars of jam and bad ceramic whales and the lasagna lady’s T-shirt that said Béchamel is My Love Language. I ate a leaf of basil from a sample and felt like I was stealing something precious. I let somebody put salt on my tongue. I was doing okay.

At the far end—always at the far end—there was a table swarmed by laughter and the kind of light that casts you a brand new shadow. A man in a plaid shirt was telling a story about a rooster he had as a boy. Can you believe it. I could hear the word in his mouth before he even said it. He slapped his thigh. He made his voice slide like a blade being sharpened. “He’d crow at everything. Two a.m. Four. Noon.”

And then someone let out a perfect imitation to show him how it had sounded. It was a trick. A party trick. It became air. The sound cut through my head. I stumbled into a display of strawberries and the whole world became red and wet and deeply polite. Someone said “Oh my gosh, honey, you okay?” and someone else said “She’s got it on her shoes,” and someone’s child laughed like a little pot boiling over. I left the market with a jaw that skipped and walked down to the water where the lamplight tried to put its hands out and then gave up.

There are moments you can feel the most convincing version of yourself being cut out of you with scissors. I sat on a bench in front of the place where the ferry used to dock, the boards scarred with carvings that had not yet believed they would be forgotten. I touched the scar on my shin and pressed until a ghost of a pain rose up properly to greet me. I leaned back and looked at the sky as if it were about to say a word into my mouth that would fix me.

“You dropped your change,” someone said.

I looked over and it was Hector, somehow, or a version of Hector, peering into the seat cushion as if it were a horizon. He put thirty-seven cents into my palm and then, because he cannot help himself, showed me how to stack the coins into a small tower that refused to fall off my knee. “Look,” he said. “Physics is your friend. You have more friends than you think. You don’t even know their names.”

“I don’t think that’s how friendship works,” I said. “I think you have to tell them things and then they have to stay.”

He nodded, slow, looking out at the moving brown. “You might be right.” He shrugged in a way that crumpled his shoulders like paper then smoothed them out again. “Okay, so tell me one thing now.”

I pictured the rooster at ten, the one with the crown you wanted to touch. I thought of the man at the market today, and the delighted cruelty it gives some people to imitate the beautiful noise that killed someone for you. I thought of how everything I have ever feared is beautiful in the story someone else is telling about it. I thought, embarrassingly, of Rowan’s hand on the coffee cup, the way he had said he would make me less sad, as if sadness were a window you could squeegee.

“I can’t breathe in the morning,” I said. “My lungs feel like they’re full of typewriter keys. In the hour when the birds start up. You know? I can’t get past it.”

“You’ll have to wake up before it,” he said. “Then it will only be joining you.”

“I do,” I said. “I do and it still feels like a thing sneaking. A thing with a beak.”

Hector looked at my hands where they were worrying the hem of my jacket and it was only then I noticed I had been wearing it all day again. The air touched my wrists and I flinched.

“You going to be okay,” he asked eventually. Not like a test, not like he was measuring my answer for parts.

“I have to be,” I said, and the lie was so practiced it clicked into place like a drawer closing. It doesn’t matter if it is true, to say it. That’s not the function of some words. Some words are just the scaffolding while the rest of you figures out how to enter a room.

He left me there after a while because everybody leaves you somewhere. And because I told him to. It is not a heroic story. It is just the kind where you make a choice and then make it again and again because the first one didn’t stick.

On my way back to the apartment, I turned down an alley where someone had chalked a hopscotch grid on the asphalt so long it looked like a spinal column. I walked it without hopping because I am not silly like that, except I am, except I didn’t. At the fence behind the laundromat, there was a small white feather snagged in the chain link. It trembled in the tiny wind. I reached out a finger and it came away as if it had only been pretending to belong there. I cupped it, this nothing, this piece of a larger thing that did not intend to miss it. I brought it upstairs and set it on the windowsill. It didn’t mean anything. It does not. Still.

The neighbor’s rooster told its morning story the next day before the light anywhere else did. I lay on my back and tried to fill my lungs one vertebra at a time. I tried to make my body the way they tell you to in the magazines where women look like they have never had a different thought than this one. Something ached in my right wrist like a storm coming. I counted to six. And then six again. I did it until it felt cheap and then I did it more.

Work was eggs and eggs and bacon the texture of autumn leaves, except the kind of autumn we have here where the leaves fall before they have time to decide what color they wanted. I watched a couple break up in the corner, gently, so gently I wanted to invent a normal amount of violence to help them along. The man had a haircut that cost seventy dollars and the woman smiled at him like a teacher as she explained what she wanted. To be happy. He looked like he was trying to absorb the information through the palms of his hands. In the end, one of them wrote a number on someone else’s receipt and we all pretended our heads were heavy; we bent them politely.

“You should get a dog,” Birdie said, tying on her apron backwards because she thought it made her look like she wasn’t working. “People with dogs have fewer… things.”

“I have a plant,” I said. “It does not help.”

“Plants do not come to you when you shake a box of something,” she said severely. “Also, what does your plant look like.”

“A fork,” I said, and she actually had to put down the coffee pot and wipe her eyes.

When the door opened and the little bells threw their voices into the air, I didn’t look up right away. I steadied a plate with my thumb on its rim so that the eggs didn’t slide. When I lifted my eyes there he was again, as if we were in a small town comedy where people bump into their nemesis every five minutes and always have a witty line prepared. Rowan held a bundle of rolled blueprints under his arm. The blueprints looked like the prop version of blueprints, the kind that make audiences lean forward. He wasn’t alone. A tall woman in an orange dress trailed behind him, her hair in a braid heavy as a rope.

“This is Ana,” he said to me by way of hello. He didn’t say who she was to him. That must be a big story in some other room. “She’s the mind that makes the math behave.”

“You think math behaves,” she said dryly, and I liked her instantly for that. “I force it into a chair for a few minutes at a time. That’s all.” She had eyes that had stared at whiteboards a lot, eyes that could see the shape of problems in their middles. She smiled at me with half of her mouth and I felt a sudden, airy envy of that casual command.

“Counter,” Rowan said. “Giant pancakes.”

“Bandwagon,” Ana said, almost smiling at him, and they took stools. The blueprints shifted in his grip and the end of the roll knocked lightly into a sugar pourer. Shut your what, I imagined it saying. Your face.

“You back again,” Birdie murmured in my ear, and from the other side of the counter, her reflection in the metal milkshake cup winked at me differently. “Your favorite kind of trouble.”

“He’s nobody,” I said to the metal cup, and then later, “He’s everyone.”

When I poured their coffee, I could smell a faint metal on his skin, like coins. Not cologne. Something after a day in a room with a lot of machines behaving. He unfolded carefully, the blueprints controlled under his hand as if they were wild.

“Don’t show her,” Ana said without looking up. “We don’t need to start the parade.”

Rowan raised his eyebrows at me as if he expected me to protest. I said nothing and rearranged forks so that their tines lined up politely. He caved immediately. That’s one thing about him: he likes to put a match to paper. Even when it isn’t prudent. He eased the roll open and spread a sheet between the napkin holder and the salt. There it was: a shape that was not a plane and not a myth. A cylinder with attitude. Windows where people would trust their eyes to air. Nosecone the length of my childhood. A staircase of words running down one side: stages and tanks and the part that drops away because it never belonged to the rest of it at all.

“You’re building a—” I stopped. The word tightened in my mouth. “A thing that goes into space.”

“A rocket,” he said, that laugh again, the small one, the one that says the secret isn’t a secret if he gives it away. “A small one. We are building a small one. We are not insane. Yet.”

Ana covered her face with one hand. “We are tenderly insane,” she corrected. Joking and not. “We are in the tender zone.”

“Why,” I asked, not meaning it calm. “There’s perfectly a lot of sky right here.”

“There’s more,” he said. “Always more.” He tapped the drawing where the second stage broke away. “Also, it’s not about the sky.”

I didn’t know who I was mad at. The roosters, the city that allowed them, the neighbor who pretended she didn’t hear them, myself for an unwillingness to be a citizen of this Earth. Rowan, for looking unruffled in a room where every napkin had already been used for someone else’s tears. “And this will—help me how,” I said, biting the word help like a raisin, which I do not like.

Rowan’s face softened in a way that made me furious because it meant he had decided to be kind to me. As if I were a small animal in a drawer. “You look at the wrong things,” he said, and put his fingertip on the place where the top of the rocket opened. “You think the story is the sound. The story is the silence afterwards.”

Ana watched him with that half-smile. It was as if she taped things together when he got too floaty. “It won’t be silent,” she said. “Unless we leave it out there.”

“Do you plan to leave it out there,” I asked, icier. “You plan to leave your… whatever, your thing, your shining toy, out there so it can not make noise at me.”

“It’s not a toy,” Ana said mildly.

“No,” Rowan said. “It’s not.” He lifted his eyes and for a second I saw the boy on the porch again, calling to the whole hot day. “It’s a way to find the part of you that doesn’t shut down at the first note of somebody else’s morning.” He considered. “It’s a ladder. You could use a ladder.”

I wiped a perfectly clean spot on the counter. I kept wiping it until the edge of the rag caught. “I have a job. I have rent. I have a plant that only looks like a fork. I am not going to—what—go to the desert and clap while you set your hair on fire.”

“You could read a book about it,” he said, almost laughing, because he knew how the suggestion would shape the air. “You could ask me questions. You are, historically, excellent at asking questions that make me reconsider my choices.”

“Why not make a quiet thing,” I said. “A piece of furniture. A coat you can sleep in.”

“The world is making a lot of those,” he said. “This is the other thing.”

They left before I could decide whether to publicly forgive them for being themselves. On his way out, Rowan put an envelope on the showcase where the pies spin under glass. “An invitation,” he said, not looking at me, not playing. “Open it or burn it. Your choice.”

After the door breathed shut, Birdie swung the envelope up by one corner like a fish. “Book club,” she guessed. “Rocket club. Club of people who glow with a strange bluish light and can eat fortune cookies without getting crumbs all over their shirts.”

“I won’t go,” I said, folding my arms so tightly the bones felt like oars. “I’m not going to participate in his fireworks festival mental health plan.”

“Okay,” she said easily. “You don’t have to. Let me see it, though.” She didn’t wait. She slid a finger under the seal like a thief and pulled out a card that did not apologize for itself. It was heavy, embossed with a symbol that looked like an eye on a horizon. The date was Friday. The place—a former hangar out near McClellan, now called the kind of name buildings get once people with extra shoes start working in them. There was a time printed. And under it, in handwriting I could read even in a dream, two words. For you.

The taste of my mouth went asphalt. “He wants to ruin me,” I said simply. “He’s the part of the world that looks directly at me and doesn’t blink.”

“Sounds like a good time,” Birdie said. “Maybe wear your jacket.”

When I got home that night, the laundromat was a tide of warm light and spinning circles. I stood in the doorway and let it wash over my face. A kid lay on the tile, rolling pennies back and forth on his forehead like weird train tracks. The woman in the corner folded towels with a speed that made the towels dizzy. I climbed the stairs and put the envelope under the single plant on the windowsill as if the plant could absorb it. I lay on my mattress with my feet going cold for no reason and tried to see the part of the day where I had been strong. At least twice I had been clever. Once I had made a child laugh by flipping my order pad over and drawing a better dinosaur than the one he believed in. The roar had come out of my pen like a blessing.

“Read it,” Hector said, somewhere, even though he was probably in his own bed talking to his own ceiling. The feather on the sill shifted as if it was distributing its weight more evenly. The night pressed its cool face against my window. Strange to live in a place where windows were the thinnest part of life.

I didn’t read it again. I already knew what it said. I didn’t sleep early. The rooster told the story again, and again, and I lay in the middle of my small room with my lungs trying to throw a rope into air and pull. When the clock on my phone rolled from 3:59 to 4:00, something in me laughed, a tiny, rude laugh, like a person trapped under a stack of quilts raising one middle finger toward heaven.

The thing about fear is how efficient it is. How little it requires to keep itself alive. A shadow. A rumor. A child telling another child a story about birds and not realizing they were handing them a key that opened a door in an empty building and that behind the door was only weather. I imagined a life where I did not think about feathers; where a man in a diner with a voice like a handled knife did not speak to me as if something could still be changed. I fell asleep so hard that when the morning came I didn’t hear it, and I dreamed a flat, blank dream where I was a plank of wood wrapped in a soft belt and someone was carrying me over a very large field of green.

I woke to the smell of soap. I woke to the click of the owner’s keys. I woke to the sound of tires on wet, although it had not rained and would not. The rooster had been crowing already. I had missed it. For the first time in days and days I had slept through the opening notes of a thing that had been introduced to me by blood. My body felt like a drawer pulled too far, off its rails. I sat up and the feather on the windowsill lifted as if breathing.

“You look better,” Birdie said later, when I rolled in late to work and apologized so thoroughly it felt like I was sweeping the whole city with my mouth. “You look like you accidentally said yes to something and now have no idea how to dress for it.”

“I look the same,” I said. “Even the coffee doesn’t get the coffee up.” 

“Don’t go,” she said unexpectedly, at my elbow, her voice low so only the floor could hear it if it wanted. “If you don’t want to. Don’t go. The world will arrange itself again tomorrow. It always does.”

I didn’t know why the kindness split me open more than the mockery. That’s a thing about me I wish were otherwise.

At lunch, Ana came back without Rowan. She wore the orange dress again like she had decided that was the uniform for a life she was testing. She sat at the counter and took her hair down and put it back up and the room adjusted to the motion without even consulting us.

“I told him not to,” she said abruptly, as I poured her water. She didn’t wait for me to ask what. “Invite you. It’s not professional.”

“I’m not a professional,” I said, as if it were a thing to be proud of. “I pour coffee and say nice things about pie.”

She nodded, eyebrows up. “That’s a profession.”

“What do you think I’ll do,” I asked her, surprising myself, a little heat. “On your launch. Cry and ruin the photographs? Spook the engines? I’ll be at the far end, if I go. With the rest of the… what do you call us.”

“Witnesses,” she said. “We call you witnesses.”

“What if I go so that I can leave early,” I asked. “What if I go so that, later, when he asks me if I went, I can say I did and it’ll be the right kind of truth.”

She watched me with a doctor’s face and a sister’s mouth. “You could come because there is a thing leaving that wanted to leave,” she said. “There are not a lot of those we get to stand near.”

I pictured the carbon of my petty heart. I pictured the metal in my fear. The way it clinked when I moved. I told Ana that the pancakes would take three minutes or two if she didn’t mind the center being a little sleepy, and that’s what we did. I gave her the short stack and she folded her napkin very precisely. She left a tip that was insulting in its generosity. My hands shook slightly when I picked it up and shook more when I put it in the jar because I thought maybe I had seen her eyelash flutter and heard her say so small I imagined it: we see you.

I walked to the river again that night. There was a man with a guitar to whom the night had not yet told the truth. He played the same four songs so sincerely I wanted to hand him a fifth. At the foot of the bridge, a woman was selling sparklers out of a plastic laundry basket. A boy took one and lit it and waved it like it could cut through the dark and make a door. The sound it made was funny and dangerous at the same time. I felt it in my teeth.

On the walkway, I stood next to a bronze bear that had clearly been petted by thousands of hands. The bear’s nose was rubbed gold. I put my palm on it and closed my eyes and tried to imagine what it would be like to be built for hibernation. To have sleep built into your bones like a plan, not a failure. I put my forehead against the cold metal for a second and felt a laugh in my chest that wasn’t for anyone.

When I turned around, Rowan was there, leaning on the rail as if he had planned it, as if he had arrived with the intention of being a symbol I would be forced to interpret. It annoyed me that he hadn’t. He nodded his head at the water like he was blaming it.

“Do people notice when you do that,” I asked. “Appear in the piece of quiet someone carved for themselves.”

“They do,” he said. “But then they don’t. It’s versatile.”

“I’m not going,” I told him. I said it so brightly you would have wanted to fix your hair.

He didn’t try to close the distance between us. It was as if someone had finally clapped their hands and sent him back to his proper spot in the scene. He kept his elbows on the rail. “You don’t have to,” he said. “It will go up without you. It will go up for reasons that have never included you. No offense.”

“Some taken,” I said.

“My job is to get it to the part of the sky where the air stops lying.” He shrugged. “Whatever the part of the sky is called where it admits that it’s not sky anymore. When it just says space, space, space. Sometimes it is not my job to know who is there to see it. But then I think of you and I think what is a witness for except this exact thing.”

“I witness every day,” I said, thinking of the way I watched my own hands be my hands. “I am a professional witness, actually. I have notes.”

“I know,” he said. His mouth did the soft thing again and I hated him for it, then didn’t. “That’s why I thought you might like to see something that doesn’t fight back.”

“You think the sky doesn’t fight back,” I said softly. “You think you came up with that idea.”

“I think I’d rather watch you watch it than not,” he said, so simply that for a minute a very old anger went quiet in me because I couldn’t find a place to step into the fight.

The night pulled its humidity out of its pockets and placed it like an offering on the back of my neck. The boy’s sparkler went out and gave a little dying noise like a mouse losing a dream. The grating under our feet hummed because of something deeper speaking through it. I looked at Rowan’s hands, the ones that either built or didn’t. “I had a rooster,” I said, because I am either generous or stupid, the way my mouth gives away keys to rooms you should not be allowed to enter.

He didn’t move. He didn’t say the wrong thing. He didn’t tell me a story about his rooster, or any he’d ever met. He didn’t say “Oh funny, we all have that same scar, look here.” He stood very still and after a while spoke the kind of sentence that finds water. “That must have been terrifying,” he said, and then he moved away, enough to give me back my own breath.

“Open the invitation,” he said, so lightly I almost missed it. Then he did what I wanted him to do, which was leave before I could decide if I would.

I walked home with my shoulders dropped just enough to notice it. I climbed my stairs and took the envelope out from under the plant and did not open it yet. I held it up to the window and tried to see the outline of the future through cream cardstock. It was nothing. It never is. I slid my thumbnail under the flap anyway. The paper made that small noise like a person getting into a different shirt. Inside, there was a smaller piece of paper, hand-torn, because he knows me and he knows I don’t trust straight edges.

Bring earplugs, it said. And under that, in Ana’s exacting print, in smaller letters: also bring your middle finger, if you like. We will respect it.

I laughed then, all at once, a ridiculous sound that felt like a person falling happily down a shallow well. I let the laugh break into a second thing that didn’t sound like a laugh at all. I sat on the floor of my little room above the laundromat in a city where the birds wake up earlier than my guard. I pinched the bridge of my nose until stars gathered there. I counted to six and then six again. I folded the invitation in half and put it in the pocket of my jacket that I wear in the heat and I sat there for a long time, listening to the washers churn and the wheel of a distant train insist upon its path, and the feather on my sill, maybe moving and maybe not, the world too big to tell any of us whether we were doing it right.Friday laid itself over the city like a sheet still warm from whoever had just been sleeping in it. I woke already dressed for something because I had fallen asleep in my clothes by accident or on purpose, and the invitation pressed its corner into my hip as if it wanted to accuse me of something. The rooster had done its job somewhere in the thin part of the morning, and my lungs had panicked in their usual way, but there had been a beat inside the flailing where another voice entered. It could have been the whine that comes right before a fluorescent bulb surrenders to light, or it could have been the feeling that I had already promised myself I would do the next thing. I lay and considered the soft crime of staying in bed until the day forgot my name, then I sat up and touched the feather on the sill to make sure it still had the same weightlessness it had yesterday.

I told myself I would go to work first and that a shift would sand the thoughts down to manageable. I told myself I would carry the invitation and let it burn my thigh and that would be enough participation for any sane person. I tucked the envelope back into the jacket pocket and my fingers found the edge of the card like a blind person searching out the house keys she always keeps in the same place. I washed my face in the tiny sink, the water running sullen, and I watched the foam gather and collapse like a party you can hear through a wall but cannot be bothered to go to. Downstairs the washers were already breathing in their patient way, and I felt them in my shins as I went down the stairs, every step a small announcement to the world that I was still making decisions in the approved manner.

On Stockton the day had not yet burned the edges of its bills, and the buses hissed with the self-regard of animals that have been domesticated too long. The hardware store near the corner had a display of discounted ear protection in a bin that did look like a small parable. I stood and let their orange plastic greet me with a fluency they did not deserve, then I picked a pair that said Industrial in a font that suggested permission from a higher authority. The man at the register had a mustache you could hang a medal on and a scar on his wrist that meant he understood sharp things. He bagged the plugs and the extra batteries I did not need and he said, “Noise is a tax we pay for living,” and I said, “Sometimes it feels like an inheritance,” and he nodded as if we were doing a conversation neither of us had to own when it was over.

At the diner the lemon clock ticked like it had been given a second chance and wanted to be very clear it would not squander it. Birdie had tied her apron on backward again and had added a safety pin in a way that made it look intentional, like a decision that had genitals. She gave me the kind of once-over I had watched her offer strangers when she wanted them to think she cared who they were. “Is that your fancy purse,” she asked, tapping my jacket pocket with a knuckle. “The one with the whole universe inside.”

“Don’t start,” I said, but I didn’t put my hand over the pocket. It felt better not to guard it, like maybe the thing inside was capable of watching itself for once. “If I go, it won’t fix me. I’m saying that now so later I don’t have to pretend to be shocked.”

“Maybe it’ll fix something else you don’t even know is loose,” she said, sliding a row of coffees down the counter toward a collection of men who had come in with their hats still cooling from the sun. “Maybe you don’t get to choose. I, for one, think that’s extremely rude of the world.”

We did the breakfast dance, which is what I call it when I make comfort look like a stack of pancakes. Uncle Ned set down a skillet with a thump like he was punctuating a math problem and hissed at the grill when it smirked at him. Someone had brought in a baby, and the baby looked like it had come directly from the factory, not a scratch on it, a mouth like a small, polite bruise. Two women in office clothes spoke to each other like they were reading notes from their own future autopsies. I moved plates and refilled mugs and let my mouth be good at being a small door people could walk through without tripping over themselves.

When the rush sloped off to the place where we could put our elbows on the counter and pretend we were actors in a play about a place like this, Hector came in without announcing himself, because his talent is in always having been there already. He took the last stool and spun it twice and looked at me over the top of a menu like it had just told him a joke. “Heard you’re going to watch a controlled apocalypse,” he said, and he spread his hands wide enough that the lemon clock ticked faster for a second.

“I am going to go stand behind a fence and not look directly at anything,” I said, and the air popped like a tiny balloon. “I bought earplugs so I can participate in the culture.”

“Proud of you,” he said, and he meant it in the way that gets into your blood where the sugar lives. “I once watched a building implode and it changed my face. Not that you can tell. I’ve only got the one.” He leaned back and looked at the ceiling as if waiting for it to confess something. “It’s good to go to a thing that does not ask for your opinion. Just your attendance.”

I told him about the note on the invitation, and he laughed into his fist until his eyes turned into coins. “You have a good committee,” he said. “Even if they dress like brochures. Even if one of them uses your name like it’s a string he can pull to let a curtain fall.”

“I am going to get in my car and drive to a location where men in vests will wave me into a parking space,” I said, pretending I had a car, pretending I had a man in a vest who knew what my space looked like. “I am going to stand in a field. I am going to find a spot where I can count to six without anyone thinking I’m rehearsing a speech.”

“Do you want company,” he asked, and his face went so gentle the light over the grill softened like a tired eye. “I can wear the kind of hat that makes people talk to you less.”

I weighed his question like a fruit, testing for the give under the skin, the hidden ripeness or the flood. I pictured him next to me at the fence, making a cathedral with his hands when the heat came, letting the sound put its thumb on his sternum and press. I pictured myself using him as a substitute for my own courage and later feeling brave when I had not actually done the thing alone. “No,” I said, and the word felt like a small instrument tuned properly. “But thank you. You can be the congratulations I walk into afterward, if afterward exists.”

“It always exists,” he said. “Even when it doesn’t.” He took the plate of eggs and ate them like a person who knows how to arrange his own hunger and make it behave. When he left he put a folded napkin under his cup and when I turned it over later there was a drawing of a ladder and under it, very small, the word both.

There was a moment, after lunch and before the afternoon sank its teeth in, where I stood in the staff bathroom and stared at my face like it belonged to someone who was still deciding whether she wanted it. I tilted my head the way you do when you’re trying to hear a song through a wall and see if the bass line is the same one you remember. I took the invitation out of my pocket and let the guilt sweat off it. I told my reflection that I was only going to look, not to be changed. The reflection looked back like it had been hired specifically to call me on that kind of lie.

By the time I got to the bus stop at the end of the line, the day had been ironed flat and the heat hung off the wires like testaments. The bus burped me out at a place where the city pretends not to know itself very well anymore, where hangars that used to hold behemoths now hold companies with names that sound like instructions or wishes. There was a sandwich truck with a chalkboard menu where a person had drawn a tomato with muscles. There were porta-potties lined up like students who did not want to be called on. A woman in a yellow vest handed me a paper wristband that explained to anyone who cared that I had been allowed to trespass.

The hangar itself had a mouth I could walk into, and I did, and the air inside was ten degrees cooler and smelled like something brittle and clean. The ceilings had their own weather happening. A loop of signs instructed us to stay behind a painted line, and the line cut the floor so straight that for a second I thought of Rowan and the T-square he never returned. The rocket—if that is what I am allowed to call a cylinder taller than the building I grew up in—did not have the vanity I had expected. It did not shimmer. It stood and wore its matte like a coat it had earned. The seams were confident. The hardware along its spine was the opposite of jewelry. It looked like a throat learning to say only one thing and preparing for the effort that would require.

Ana found me before Rowan did, which felt like luck. She came up beside me without a sound and stood shoulder to shoulder as if we had arrived together on purpose. Up close, her dress was threaded with a very small pattern of triangles, and for reasons I could not immediately defend, I found that detail reassuring. She saw me seeing the shape in front of us and she let the quiet yawn long enough to cover most of what women are forced to tuck away so that a day can move forward without choking.

“It’s static fire,” she said finally, her voice like a pencil drawing a line that actually connects. “No launch today. If you want to be mad about something, be mad about how often we call things a launch even when it is not. Words get worn out and then we keep wearing them like shoes.”

“I can be mad about more than that,” I said, and I felt how the absurdity loosened my shoulders. “I brought earplugs and my worst manners. I will try to distribute them evenly.”

“Keep the manners,” she said, almost smiling. “People do not understand sound until they meet it with their bones. The plugs will um… filter. But your chest will take a note and hold it for a while. That’s the part that stays with you. It is not a warning. It is just a thing I like to say to witnesses.”

I watched a crew of people with bright badges move like very careful fish around the base of the structure. Someone shouted something we were not meant to hear and everyone else moved three steps to the left and then stopped. A table under a banner held a bouquet of cables, the cruel kind that do exactly what you tell them and nothing else. A boy who could not be older than sixteen wore a headset whose ear cups swallowed his head as if he had been born with them. Two women in linen were already crying. We were only at the part where anybody could have gone home and claimed attendance and been forgiven for lying.

Rowan came the way men come into rooms they have already swept with their eyes. He wore a badge that had his name and also some other word I could not read from here, and his expression was an expensive thing he put on to comfort investors and unwanted gods. When he saw me he did the very good thing of looking like it was ordinary that I would be there. That was the oldest kindness between us and I recognized its weight like you do a set of keys when you reach into a bag and you find them among the pens and the coins and the little paper crumbs. He did not touch me. He held up a second set of ear defenders and I took them like a person takes a baby from a stranger on a bus, with solemnity and a little delight.

“They look good with your earrings,” he said, and he glanced at Birdie’s borrowed red hearts as if they were responsible for something about me he had failed to imagine before. “After the burn there will be a wind. It will not be a wind. The ground will be responsible for the part that feels like wind. You will feel the fence lean into your thighs. You will think it is moving backward. It is not. Just lean with it and then it will stop.”

“I could go home instead,” I said, but there was no heat in it. “I could have eggs and then read a book about whales and pretend I have a different problem.”

“You could,” he said. “And you would still be here with me later whether you were in the room or not.” He looked toward the table of cables, then at Ana, who had moved to put one small hand against the shin of the machine, a gesture so gently proprietary that it broke me down the middle. “Go where you want. Just don’t make a story out of it yet. Let it be a thing first.”

The countdown was not a theatrical thing with a man in a tower saying numbers with the sanctity of a priest; it was a series of codes not meant for us, and we were given the broad strokes through a speaker with the emotional range of a cleanly tuned organ. We were told there would be a release. We were told to keep our hands behind the line. The boy with the headphones took them off and scratched his eyebrow and put them back on in exactly the same position, and the gesture touched me with a ridiculous tenderness. It is possible to love anyone for one second at a time if you believe them about their small habits.

I put in the earplugs and the world moved away by a margin I could count. I put on the defenders over them, because I am an overachiever in the wrong categories, and then the speaker became a mouth moving behind a window. There was a shiver in the vertical muscle of the rocket I would have sworn I could see even though I knew I was only feeling my own anticipation using me as an instrument. I counted to six and I failed to believe in the ladderness of numbers and I counted again anyway. The fence knit a line into my thighs. People took their cameras out and then put them down because some part of them knew they were about to be embarrassed by their own devices.

When the ignition came it did not so much arrive as reveal that it had always been there. The flame had the color of something burning that had never actually known about orange. The sound came through the plugs and through the defenders and then through the parts of me that had no business being involved. My ribs lifted in their own surprise and then were held. The fence moved into me exactly as promised and I moved with it exactly as I had been told and in that instant obedience felt not like a failure but like a secret someone had pressed into my palm when I was too young to hold it.

I expected to be torn. I expected the sound to go to the room in me where the ten-year-old still slept with her shoes on. I expected the rooster’s bright blade to lay me open like a fruit you can no longer deny has ripened past usefulness. What happened instead was that the sound was so much larger than every other sound that it carried those small ones in the mouth of it like seeds. It took them and worried them and made them look ridiculous. The crowing in my head still had its exact pattern but it was an insect under a train now, a rumor in a stadium in the middle of a championship that had insisted upon itself. My hands shook but not in fear, not exactly. My knees were soft, prayers without pronouns. I watched the plume heave the world’s weight a fraction of an inch to the side so the world could find another way to rest, and across the line, Ana opened both hands toward it as if releasing a bird she had just remembered she was not meant to keep.

The burn cut off so cleanly it made everyone around me suck in breath that belonged to someone else. The absence of sound had a shape that laid itself over us like a second sky, an inverted bowl we found ourselves under, blinking, pupils grabbing for the change. In that bowl I could hear the zippers on jackets that were not my jacket. In that bowl, a toddler stopped crying because whatever it had been crying about was now too small to justify the mouth it was using. The ground forgot about the wind it had promised me. The fence shrugged like an animal already moving on. Far off, a car alarm decided to audition for relevance and then gave up, stunned by its own lack of imagination. The air felt used in a good way.

There were cheers, late, after the silence had been recognized and invited to sit down with us. Hands came together with that hollow sound that tells you we are imitating rain. Someone whooped and then laughed because the whoop had come out of them without permission. A man two down from me had tears streaming into his beard like he had just learned how to sweat and was doing it wrong. I did not clap. I put my hands on the top rung of the fence and pressed until the wire made its grid in my palm, and I let the grid sting and then cool, and the mark it left was a small map of how to stay.

Rowan found me after the second wave of applause sputtered and then found its own hum. He came not alone but with the kind of quiet that is only available to people who have just been briefly necessary in a way that satisfies and terrifies them. He didn’t ask if I was okay; he looked at my face with the respect you give to someone’s carefully curated interior. I was breathing like I had just outrun a story. Somewhere behind him a voice announced numbers that meant something had been learned and that money would continue having a reason to leave. He nodded toward the machine like you nod toward a person who has finally done the thing you suspected it could do all along. I nodded back because anything else would have been arrogant.

“You didn’t flip us off,” he said in a voice that sounded like he would have forgiven me if I had.

“I forgot to take my hands off the fence,” I said. “It felt like it would forget me if I didn’t hold onto it. It would go develop a new philosophy, and I would still be here in the chapter before the last one where everyone thinks nothing much is going to change.”

“That’s not what chapters are,” he said, soft enough the ear defenders pretended they were the ones not hearing him. “They pile their weight on each other until one of them cracks and then the book remembers you were meant to turn the page a while ago and you just didn’t want to be rude.”

Ana appeared, hair escaping its rope as if the sound had loosened it. Her eyes were bright in a way that only ever means one thing: she had pitched herself at chaos and been caught. She put two fingers against the inside of my wrist like she was taking my pulse, and then she took her hand away before I could do the cheap trick of pretending I had not wanted her to. “That was the loud part,” she said, and then she smiled entirely this time, the small muscles around the mouth ceding the field to something generous. “Now we go collect the quiet and put it back where it belongs.”

“What is the quiet, to you,” I asked, because questions are my only sincere ornament.

“The unmeasured,” she said, turning, because they were already calling her. “The part that wins even if you didn’t imagine a race.”

People around us began to disperse in the practiced way of people who had to go to a second thing that would occupy the first thing properly in their minds. The yellow vests folded into the rest of the scene as if they had never been transporting humans in a particular direction. A child announced to anyone who would listen that she had seen a dragon and had not been eaten by it, and I wanted to send a postcard to my younger self to let her know how useful that declaration might be later. The boy in the headset took it off and revealed hair that had been making a different humidity under there and he shook his head and grinned so purely it made me forgive a dozen roosters.

I did not linger to be turned into a witness in the official sense of the word. I did not go behind the hangar to watch the team clap each other on the backs in that pleasantly restrained way people who have budgets have to do it. I did not loop my fingers into Rowan’s and tell him anything that would have made either of us think we were responsible for whatever shift had just happened in my bones. I walked out into the light that had been standing there the whole time and felt the after of the sound curl up in the curve between my ribs and wait to be turned into something else. The sandwich truck tomato flexed and I almost forgave it. A cormorant crossed the sky with the insistent stroke of a creature that has been misunderstand at least twice and has decided to take the long way anyway.

On the bus back the ear defenders hung around my neck like a credential, and the earplugs made my thoughts sound like they were coming through a long hallway lined with velvet. An old man in a brown suit sat across from me and held a bouquet wrapped in paper that had the proofreader’s marks still on it. He stared at me in the way that knows better than to be rude and then, with effort, looked away. We rode for seven stops in a silence that had nothing to do with politeness and everything to do with a kind of tender exhaustion. Somewhere in the middle of that I realized my jaw was not clenched. I opened my mouth like a fish just to feel the muscles stop doing their morning job.

By the time I got to my block the delta breeze had limbered up, and the wires made their thin music like someone leaning a fiddle against a wall and letting it remember a tune by itself. I turned the corner toward the laundromat and stopped because my neighbor was out in her small yard with a bowl of wilted lettuce and the rooster was there, too, a sharp-fitted machine wearing feathers. He stepped with that hitched confidence, every leg a question he had already answered. His throat swelled and I watched the terrible mechanism arrive, the pressurized moment, the old voice like a nail in wood.

He threw the sound and it hit the air above my head and then slid down into me the way a hot washcloth slides down a window. It was still his sound. It was still a blade. It still found my scar like a faithful friend. It did not knock my breath out of me. It did not take the numbers out of my mouth. It pressed and my body pressed back and I felt the absence that had followed it all those years accommodate itself to the day without eating it whole. The neighbor turned and saw me and lifted her chin in a gesture that could have been greeting or could have been an alert sent out to all the places where she was keeping decisions in jars. I lifted my hand and the rooster lifted his foot and we acknowledged one another like citizens who will never vote the same way and will still have to share a sidewalk.

Upstairs the feather on the sill had arranged itself invisibly into something that looked like a smaller thing pretending not to be a wing. The washer drums turned and turned until they made a hymn. I took the ear defenders off and put them on the table and they looked like an animal at rest. I stood in the middle of the room and pulled my jacket off and let the air touch my wrists and did not flinch; then I put the jacket back on, just because I could, and the decision was so small it felt like a joke I had told myself and finally gotten. I lay on my back on the mattress and placed both hands on the ridges of my ribs and waited for the morning to arrive inside the afternoon and tell me what it always tells me, and when it did, I listened, and afterward I waited for the other thing, the after, the bowl, the unmeasured, and when it came, it came clean.On Saturday, the laundromat below me miscounted quarters and made a low, aggrieved noise that felt almost human. I lay on my back like a person in a museum who doesn’t know which piece she is supposed to be understanding, and then I got up and opened the window and let the city step right inside. It did so warily at first, showing an elbow, a little street, the bristle of a palm, and then it shoved the rest of itself in because it has never been good at hovering on thresholds. A mylar balloon with a faded Congratulations on it did slow revolutions on the telephone line as if it were relearning a dance taught to it by a wind that had left town. Somewhere close, the rooster threw his distrust at the air, and I stood and listened and felt the bowl of silence begin to form in the wake like a second, secret architecture lowering itself over the neighborhood, the way a mother might lower a colander over a boiling pot to keep the noodles from escaping. I breathed into the bowl because that’s the kind of person I was becoming, apparently, the kind who used a kitchen metaphor to organize her lungs.

I made coffee too strong as if I were punishing the beans for being beans. I drank it in three gulps like a woman who had appointments with several irritating saints. Then I did something I had not done in years, which is to take a pen that was not for orders and draw a line that did not have to denote a price. The line refused to be a bird at first, which felt fair. It was an uncooperative stick laid across another uncooperative stick, and then the suggestion of a wing turned up like a person late to a party who still expects their coat to be taken. I didn’t force it. I drew a fence instead, the particular squint of metal my thighs had memorized, and then I drew the grid on my palm the way it had printed itself there, tiny squares that looked like an admission form for a life I had finally decided to fill out.

By midmorning I was restless enough to invent an errand. I could have gone to the market and bought basil and let it behave in my kitchen like a well-meaning guest, but I chose the other thing, the one that had more gravity in it. I walked to Oak Park, past the parts where the city was trying out a new version of itself with earnest signage and careful coffee, and into the streets that had not agreed to a face-lift because they were tired of being asked to audition for anyone’s future. The house was still there because some houses have a contract with time that says “fine, but I get to keep my face.” The porch paint still peeled, but in different shapes, like a translation with its own ambitions. The chain-link gate made that sound all chain-link gates make, the one that suggests you are about to meet your history and it has been sharpening a spoon.

The sign with the nonprofit name had been replaced by another sign with another name, softer font, a logo that looked like a leaf and a person and a promise had been put through a blender together. The yard had surrendered to dandelions with such thoroughness I considered it a kind of coup. I stood on the sidewalk and put both hands in my jacket pockets like they were rehearsing for an emergency. A girl in a yellow T-shirt that read STAFF in a font that was trying too hard came out with a trash bag and a look on her face like she had recently learned how to be firm. She saw me and did not ask how she could help me, and somehow this restraint felt like an invitation.

“It used to be,” I said, then stopped, because there is no verb that does not try to win when you let it into a sentence like that. “I used to be here.”

“Same,” she said, and it was one of the most complicated same’s I had ever been handed. She had a scar on her knee that had been earned rather than administered. She did not look at the house when she said it. She looked at the ground, which was the board we had all written our names on in chalk and trusted the rain to remember.

“Is she still—” I began, meaning Sister Eileen who was not a sister and barely the idea of one, the way a story barely resembles the thing it claimed to be about.

“No,” the girl said, and if there was relief in it it was the kind that arrives already folded. “Someone else. Names and names and names.” She hooked her thumb under the lip of the trash bag and shook it down with competence. “You want to come in?”

I didn’t and I did, which is the full description of my adult life. I shook my head and the girl accepted it like she had plenty of other things to put on her list. She went back inside and the screen door closed with the exact snap that had made me jump the first five hundred times and then become part of the soundscape of endurance. I stood a minute longer with the sun pressing its hand against my shoulder like a cousin who always hugs too long. Then I walked away because the past and I had made an agreement there on the sidewalk that neither of us was equipped to honor just yet.

On the way back I bought a tomato the size of the old glass doorknob on my first apartment, and the woman who sold it to me told me to salt it and eat it over the sink like a person who knew the practical gospel. I did, later, and my chin was wet and my mood made a small, private adjustment in the direction of people who have sometimes successfully been mammals. In the afternoon I worked, and the lemon clock did penance for its own optimism and we fed the army that is capitalism until it was willing to lie down and burp.

Rowan did not come in for two days, which made the corners of the diner feel less like corners. I missed him the way you miss a tooth you finally get removed. The absence lifts its head at odd hours and you stick your tongue there and inform the empty space that you are in charge of it, which has never once changed the shape of an absence but still feels like work. Ana did not come either, which made me feel as if the math had taken a vacation without telling anyone it was entitled to one, and I found myself looking at the spot at the counter where their elbows had gone and trying to imagine the weight as a concrete number. Birdie made a show of not noticing me notice, which is why I will give her money if she ever decides to run for office.

At closing, when the lights voluntarily aged us by five years, I asked Birdie if she wanted to see where she lived when she told people she lived in a van. She took the dishrag from her shoulder as if it were a tiara and threw it into the bus tub like a bouquet. We walked out into evening and there were people on the sidewalk complicating each other’s promises. Birdie’s van was red now because it was whatever color had stuck to it since the last time she parked under a tree that felt generous. Inside it smelled like eucalyptus and effort. She had hung a curtain made out of a fabric printed with tiny strawberries, and it moved when we breathed like we were causing weather.

“The secret is you never expect it to be more than it is,” she said, flipping a crate to make a chair that decided to cooperate. “It’s not a house. It’s not a plan. It’s a place to put yourself until you remember how to put yourself somewhere else.”

“It looks like a small chapel someone forgot to bless,” I said, and she tossed me a tangerine that I tried to catch with more dignity than I managed.

“You’re allowed to like things without having to keep them forever,” she said. Her earrings bobbed like cherries that had decided not to go into a pie. “Including men who bring you invitations to their personal thunder.”

“You’re telling me to like him and then let him go,” I said, and the van hummed briefly as a truck went past that thought the street belonged to its grandparents.

“I’m telling you to like yourself,” she said, because she is not a simple person and hates to let a joke get old. “And not confuse that with liking the people who happen to be standing nearby when you realize you can do that.” She opened a small plastic drawer that would have made any reasonable person break into hives and pulled out a ring with a red stone so fake it had accomplished a kind of honesty. “Also consider stealing this if you ever go someplace you want to be more dramatic than you currently are.”

I put the ring on and my hand became the kind of hand that would accept a bouquet without knowing whom to thank. We sat there and let the horn section of the freeway give us its nightly rehearsal. Somewhere across the street someone practiced trumpet into a pillow and there were wrong notes and right ones and I liked the wrong ones better because they had to try harder to exist. When I climbed down, I left the ring on the crate and Birdie did not make a show of noticing my restraint, which is what made me want to steal her and keep her in my pocket, which of course is not how friendship is legal.

Sunday I spent doing the specialized form of nothing that involves laundromats, a pile of clothes that could represent any life if you squint, and the kind of quarters that feel freshly born. The boy who had rolled pennies on his forehead reappeared and discovered that he could stand on one foot on the rubber mat in front of the largest machine and feel like a surfer without moving an inch. His mother informed him this was not the spirit of surfing, and he informed her back that he was not currently managing a spirit. I watched them and folded my T-shirts into rectangles so precise that for a moment I believed I was a useful person.

That night I wrote a list of things that did not have to prove anything and then I crumpled it because I am not good at leaving lists alone. The next morning the rooster woke me with his same mechanical joy and I let the sound throw its hook and then let the hook hang in the air without catching me, and then I threw a smaller hook into the silence after and reeled in something I couldn’t name. I am not suggesting I had moved to a better neighborhood inside my own head; I am suggesting I could see a map on the wall of a room that used to be locked.

Rowan returned as if he had been hidden behind the jukebox the whole time. He had a cut on his thumb that had been persuaded not to bleed with a small tape. The bandage was the kind the nurse puts on children who have been brave even though bravery had turned out to be something else entirely. Ana came in after him, hair in a knot that refused its assignment. They sat. Birdie took their order because she knew I needed a minute to go to the back and tell the condiments that we were going to behave like adults. When I came out, I refilled water like it was opera.

“We did a thing in the hangar that was boring to watch and beautiful to know,” Rowan said in one of those government sentences. “There is a rhythm to ordeal and we are somewhere in the part where the drummer goes to get a drink.”

“I like the quiet part better than I expected,” I admitted in a way that made me want to put my head in my hands and confess to liking other things too, like lemon bars and particular street corners and the moment when a bus driver waves you across and you wave back like you just won an award.

“Me too,” Ana said, and she took a small tool out of her pocket and used it to pry a lodged flake of croissant from between her molars with the care of a person defusing something delicate. “I always like the math before the story gets applied to it. But sometimes I pretend otherwise because the story gets the attention and likes to be fed.”

“I went back to the house,” I said, because apparently I am the sort of woman who brings a grenade to breakfast and then unscrews it in polite company.

Rowan put his palm flat on the counter as if he were stopping a sheet of paper from escaping. It was not drama; it was a necessary physics. “And?”

“I didn’t go in,” I said. “I looked at the screen door like the next line would know what to do with me. A girl came out and said same. We made a tiny, perfect circle and then we both pretended we were not artists.”

“My father used to stand at the kitchen window and talk to the maple like it owed him rent,” Ana said in a tone that offered her history as a device, not a debt. “Now when I have to look at something too long to understand it I find a leaf and argue with the chlorophyll. It helps.”

“I sometimes coax screws,” Rowan said, almost apologetically. “I talk to them like they have options. You would be surprised how often they take the deal.”

“I am not sure I would be,” I said, and we were quiet a moment, which felt like a room someone remembered to open a window in. “I might talk to the rooster,” I added, not quite above a whisper. “I might tell him he can have what he has and I’ll have what I have and we can agree to frighten each other only by appointment.”

“You can negotiate with an engine,” Ana said. “The bird will do what it does. But your agreement is with your own body, not with him. Tell it you will get to count to seven and then you will decide whether to be dramatic.”

“Seven is outrageous,” I said, but not entirely. “I am not a ladder.”

“All numbers are a promise someone else made first,” Hector said from the corner booth where he had appeared without asking permission, a habit that could have been spooky if he hadn’t always brought a bag of something. “Count crooked if you want. Five, mango, knives, six. Tell me what changes.”

“How long have you been there,” I asked, accepting a handful of sweet, salty almonds that tasted like a compromise I could respect.

“I came in on the part where she said grenade,” he said. “I felt professionally obligated.”

On Tuesday, after a morning that had the gall to be mild, I saw the neighbor in her yard pinning laundry with a concentration I envied. The rooster loitered around her ankles like an old cop at a high school football game. His comb shone. I had done the courtesy of imagining her a villain, which is a handy habit that keeps you upright, and then I had done the more difficult courtesy of imagining her a person who had someone’s clemency in her pocket. I stood at the fence and lifted my hand like I was asking permission to talk in class. She looked up and nodded and then I had to do the talking.

“Your bird,” I said, immediately hating the politics of the possessive. “I live above the laundromat. It’s not that I want him gone. He… startles me. I’m trying to be less startled.”

She was older than me by a decade or maybe just by the amount of sleep she had lost. Her hair was the color of distant bark. She had a face that had been argued with and chosen not to argue back. “He has nowhere else,” she said. “My brother took him and then my brother stopped taking things. He thinks the day needs him. He’s not wrong.”

“I would like to be less wrong in the morning,” I said stupidly, and then I laughed because the sentence had pretended to be a better sentence than it was. “I bought earplugs as if I were an airport.”

“I put a box over him sometimes,” she said, and I nearly kissed her hands then and there, but she lifted one gloved finger to take away the thanks because it exhausted her. “It just… makes him louder later. And then I miss the first part of the morning and I don’t like that. I like the part where the day tells me it is not yet my problem.”

We stood in the little exchange zone that exists between fences, where lives pass goods to each other that they would rather not name. The rooster cocked his head and practiced looking like a lamp. I could see the notch in his right spur that made him less lethal or more, depending on your angle.

“What if we built him a better box,” I said. “Not a box. A… dressing room.” I gestured in the air where architecture lives before it descends into wood. “A place where he could rehearse his mornings and then send them out to us at a volume we can bear.”

“You know how to build,” she said skeptically, and I had to respect the skepticism as a sister.

“I know how to make the grill stop pretending to be on fire,” I said, which is a skill not entirely unrelated. “And I know someone who knows screws. And someone who can make numbers sit down like students. And someone with a van that can collect things like pallets and misfit carpet squares and a piece of plexiglass that used to be a sneeze guard and wants to be something else.”

She looked at me for a beat long enough to test whether I was doing that thing people do where they make a plan to justify having interfered. Then she shrugged, an elegant mountain collapsing into itself. “Bring your people,” she said. “Bring yourself. Bring gloves.”

The next day was the kind of day where the heat forgets to ask permission. We showed up anyway because adults do the thing on the day they said even when the weather is an essay against it. Birdie wore a hat that looked like it had been stolen from a child who had tried out the concept of being a farmer for Halloween and then changed their mind. Hector brought a power drill that had aspirations. Rowan brought a tape measure and a face that understood corners as a religion and offered no commentary about the holiness of any of this. Ana drew a rectangle in the dirt and then made a small adjustment that later saved all of us from having to admit we had put a hinge in the wrong place.

We worked, which is to say we gave our bodies something uncomplicated to do while our heads found out new ways to be with their own trouble. The rooster stood on the ladder I had refused to be and watched us with suspicion that bordered on admiration. He crowed a few times as if to contribute and the sound hit my ribs and then went to sit quietly in the after-bowl I carried around like a second stomach. The neighbor—her name was Leticia, which she offered as if it were a piece of fruit with a good smell—brought us ice water in tall plastic cups from which we sucked and pretended to be grateful without being effusive because she would have hated effusive.

We made a small, sturdy thing with air holes like secrets and a door that opened the way good decisions open, cleanly, with a catch that says, “I will stay where you put me until you say otherwise.” Hector painted a stripe down the side for no reason that needed to be named. Birdie drew a heart on the inside, lower than eye level, so it would be a private joke between a bird and a person willing to crouch. Rowan used his thumb to smooth the ragged edge of a cut and then sucked the blood without making a pun, which is the height of restraint. Ana wrote an equation on the underside of the roof with a pencil and we all pretended not to look later even though we wanted to understand what it meant to place math where feathers would brush it in the dark.

When we were done we lifted the box with our hands under it like pallbearers at a wedding and set it in the shaded corner Leticia had cleared. The rooster gave us a speech we did not deserve. He inspected the air holes. He pecked the latch in a way that made me think of bank robbery. He stepped inside with the gallant indecision of a man walking into a room where he might be forgiven. Leticia closed the door and we stood there and waited for nothing in particular because it is hard for humans to leave a scene before it tells us what it wants to be about.

“I could make you all empanadas,” Leticia said into the pause, and I almost wept at the idea that gratitude sometimes looks like pastry.

“I could cry into mine,” I offered, and this was as close as we got to a toast.

That night the rooster woke into his dressing room and staged his performance and the volume shaved a slice off itself and fell glittering into the dry grass. I woke to it and waited, and the quiet came on a little sooner and it had a new shape in it, a square with a catch. I counted to seven just to insult myself, and when the number arrived it did so without making a scene. My lungs did not throw furniture. I lay there and thought about roofs and boxes and the way a city holds the shapes we place inside it and makes room for the way those shapes change us back.

Rowan left town two mornings later in a truck that had a kind of grit on it that you could not purchase at a store. He came by before he went. He stood in the diner in the brief hour when everything gleamed as if it had been discovered rather than cleaned. He put a piece of paper on the counter and did not push it toward me because we were done with the talking part where one of us tried to get the other to lean in. I poured him coffee and put my hip against the case of pies like the pies and I had taken a vow. He told me the name of the town where he would be sleeping and it sounded like the sound a nail makes even if you say it pretty. He did not apologize for what he had, which was relief and fatigue and a joy he wore like a T-shirt he was not embarrassed to have sweat through.

When he left he put his hand on the doorframe the way men do when everyone behind them is waiting for the air to be released. He said, “You will always be part of the story I tell myself about why I build loud things.”

I said, “You will always be the person who drew a wing and then taught me the shape of what comes after noise.”

He laughed that small laugh that is really a sign for something that cannot be safely smuggled, and then he went out into the car alarm of the day and was gone. Ana came in later, alone, and ate toast like a person who had been living on solvents and apologies. She left a napkin with a drawing of a rectangle with air holes and the word iterate under it, which I tacked to the wall where I imagine important organizations keep their signage.

In the weeks that followed, the city kept being the city with a kind of ruthless grace that would have made a good aunt. The buses confided in the corners and then lied to the crosswalks. The palm fronds clicked like teeth and the wires sang when the delta wind wanted to show off. I began to say hello to the rooster not only out of courtesy but as if he and I had a union now, and sometimes, when his throat swelled, my chest would answer not with a flinch but with the particular relaxation of an exhausted muscle: an understanding without forgiveness.

Birdie took a day to go visit her mother who is not a mother and came back wearing a necklace made out of whatever happens to stones when they overhear a soft joke. She would not tell me if she had wept because that information is proprietary in her country. Hector started a tiny class on balance in the alley behind the diner, teaching children how to stack coins in ways that pretended to be physics and then admitted to being art. Leticia called across the fence to tell me the box had not made the rooster a better person but had made the mornings better at being mornings, which was all we had asked. My plant put out an actual leaf, not a fork, and I accepted it without reading into it, which felt like I had learned a new muscle in my face.

I caught myself counting backward one morning for no reason except the luxury of it, and when I reached one I did not panic at the absence of zero waiting beneath. I started drawing again in the spaces that cafes and laundromats offer like little harmless crimes, birds that were not roosters and machines that were not just machines. I drew the lemon clock as if it were a god we had made in our own image, and I drew the bronze bear and gave it an expression nobody had bothered to install. I put the drawings under the plant and in library books and in the pockets of my jacket with the invitation still sleeping there like a pressed flower that has refused to become paper. Sometimes I thought I could hear a quiet whine behind it, that preludial sound a bulb makes before it decides whether to be lit. Sometimes I imagined the sound came from the part of me that is an engine on blocks, waiting for a hood and a hand and the first turn of a key.

One evening, at the hour when the river pretends to be a piece of silk someone is pulling out of a closed fist, I found Hector on the levee with a small kite that had a tail made out of detritus. He handed me the string without sermon. The wind dug its knuckles into the paper politely but insistently, and the kite went up and then came down and then went up again and learned. My fingers remembered that the world can pull and not be trying to take anything from you. Hector told a story about a woman he knew who could tell you, by smell, where rain had last been. I told a story about a boy who wore yellow wings and could not find an angle off the porch that would give him up to air. We pretended these stories were not about the same person I had been at different times.

“Are you happier,” Hector asked me, without putting me on trial.

“I am less convinced that I have to know what the word means,” I said, and the kite dipped and recovered as if it approved. “I am more convinced I am not only my worst mornings.”

“Good,” he said. “Keep your ears. Keep your hands. Keep your middle finger, too, because that’s just democratic.”

On a Thursday, days after and days before anything anyone would call a milestone, the rooster startled and crowed and the silence arrived and I lay on my back in the small room over the laundromat with my hands on the architecture of my ribs. I named the spaces between each bone as if they were rooms for rent, and I hired the quiet to live there at least until winter. I thought of the rocket in its hangar learning the patient math of next, the way a body learns a new ritual in the dark. I thought of a box with a heart drawn on the inside so low only someone willing to bend would see it. I thought of Birdie’s safety-pinned apron and the lemon clock’s late repentance and Ana’s pencil writing where birds would sleep and Leticia’s careful pinching of laundry and Rowan’s thumb smoothing a cut and my own palm, mapped by wire.

I fell asleep before the alarm and I woke to the sound of washers tumbling someone else’s life into clean, and the feather on my windowsill had shifted slightly, which I did not permit myself to interpret. I went downstairs and had a conversation with the change machine about the ethics of breaking a twenty. I went to work and poured coffee and won a short, private battle with a clingy piece of saran wrap. I counted to six and then to mango and then to both, and the day held. The day held as if it had been designed to. The day held long enough for me to start believing that some of this, not all, not the magical thinking of it, but the very basic engineering of being alive, was going to keep working even when I wasn’t watching it every second like an overqualified night guard. I said hello to the palm trees and to the cranes and to the sign that had decided God Is Not mad at anything anymore, and they said nothing back, which is the only kind of answer I trust.Summer figured out my name and started using it like we were already familiar. The heat made the sidewalks give back every footstep with interest, and by ten a.m. the iron railing outside the laundromat had the temper of a skillet. The rooster’s dressing room, as Leticia had begun to call it with a touch of theater, did its job without smugness. His morning declarations reached me shaved down and honeycombed with mercy; sometimes they arrived late, as if he had auditioned the sound a few times for his own satisfaction before giving it to the neighborhood. The first day I woke into that diminished edge I expected the relief to electrify me. Instead my body stared into the quiet the way you look into a mirror in a dim room and wait for the trick, and when none came, a second quiet arrived on top of the first like a soft hat. I met it with the ear defenders around my neck because I am melodramatic even when I am behaving, and then I set them on the sill and watched the feather next to them agree to stay put in a way I didn’t take personally.

Word came that the thing in the hangar had graduated to a place with horizons. A public calendar without obvious secrets sprouted a rectangle around a Saturday and wrote Mojave in letters that looked as if they had learned English recently and were trying to impress it. The card in my jacket did nothing except sit there like a small, confident animal that does not need to prove warmth by leaping into your lap. When I told Birdie, she was already smoothing a map she had rescued from a gas station that had closed before either of us could remember being sentimental about it. “Road trip,” she said, and the syllables were the kind people used to extend by pretending to be surprised at their own impulses. “I will bring a hat, two playlists, half a tank, and enough optimism to insult the gods. You will bring the plugs and the finger. Between us we have a full set.”

Leticia lifted the rooster’s latch with two fingers and made sure he understood she was the director of rehearsal, not the stagehand. “You go bring back a story that isn’t dust,” she said, and her mouth curved with disbelief and permission in equal parts. “If you can find oranges on the wind, put some in your pocket for me. The ones at the buyer’s market lately taste like someone made a mistake and didn’t submit a correction.” The rooster bobbed, unimpressed with our plans, and scratched one deliberate line in the dirt that read, to me, as I will not congratulate your ambition. I reached toward him with my thoughts and then stopped because I have finally learned that some creatures prefer their conversations to be audible.

The freeway south was a throat we slid down, lined with billboards that tried to convince us we were about to become better people if only we rearranged our appetites. The fields unrolled like a green ambition someone had decided to fund, and then they surrendered to orchards that stood in platoons, each tree a soldier who knew how to be still without ever meaning passivity. Every few miles a water tower lifted its white belly against the bleached sky and told us the names of towns as if we had asked politely. Birdie drove with the careful arrogance of someone who had piloted worse machines through tighter corridors, and she flicked ash out the window in tiny ceremonial gestures that convinced me for a second that the freeway itself appreciated ritual. At the rest stop a man held his dog like it was a possibility he had recently been granted; in the shade a boy pretended not to be crying by counting the soda machines. Birdie bought sunglasses so loud a human should have announced them, and I bought a bag of oranges because Leticia had instructed my errands like a queen issuing mandates with strawberries on her tongue.

Names came up because we always trip over them on long pieces of road. “Do you ever miss yours,” I asked, meaning the one she didn’t wear on her shirt.

“It misses me,” she said, and she made quick work of a tangerine, rolling the peel into a spiral a mathematician would have recognized as toward. “It sits in drawers and mail and the mouths of people who knew me when I let them, and sometimes it walks into a room the way a person who owes rent walks in—asking for nothing out loud and everything under the teeth. I like Birdie because it leaves. It knows how to fly when the conversation needs a door.” She handed me a quarter of the fruit and I let the sugar remind me my mouth had purposes other than saying no. “What about yours,” she asked, as if offering a mirror but wiping it first so I couldn’t accuse her of cruelty.

“It’s attached to me in public records like a sticker someone put on a shirt in the wrong laundry,” I said. “It comes up when I have to be witnessed by strangers who need to spell me. When I say it out loud in rooms where nothing is about to break, it sounds like a coin in a glass jar. I wear it under other names like a thin shirt under a sweater. Some days I have the urge to climb out of all of them and just be a noise.” We let the air swallow that and then gave the air something it wanted more: the outline of the next exit, the smell fifty miles ahead of us that knew it would soon be burned into tires.

We slept in a motel where the bedspreads wore a pattern that wanted to be polite more than attractive, and the carpets had learned to accept history without dramatizing it. The clerk slid us two keys that were somehow heavier than their plastic should have allowed and warned us without rancor about the ice machine, which had aspirations to opera. I lay on my back and counted the galaxies stamped into the ceiling by paint rollers and accidents of light. Later, when the desert cooled just enough to let the idea of movement back in, we walked to the edge of town where the asphalt forgot itself and a chain-link fence reminded it. A dog barked four times and then reconsidered, and somewhere out beyond the dinner plate of civilization a coyote laughed once out of professional obligation. The stars were not the spray a poet would have promised; they were nails in a dark plank, driven with varying levels of conviction, and I found their irregularity soothing. Birdie told me a story about the first time she slept in her van with the windows cracked and woke to a moth sitting on her collarbone like a minor god, and I told her about the night at the river when silence arrived so decisively I thought maybe it had been waiting in a closet for me to open my mouth. We let our words be work and then be nothing.

At the site, the wind behaved like a supervisor who wanted everyone to understand they were being timed. Dust ran its errands without asking who had given it permission to be thorough. The small rocket did not look small anymore. It had gathered all the scale that anticipation pumps into machines, and it wore scaffolding like jewelry it would be allowed to shed in a few minutes if everyone agreed to be civilized. People in vests were not one person but a choreography. Radios whispered like conspiracies that had been taught manners. Ana materialized from a distance and offered Birdie a handshake so efficient it felt like a completed sentence. “I have admired your earrings,” she said, and if there was a joke in it, it was dressed well. Birdie touched the hearts as if to reassure them they were safe among engineers. “I brought no math,” she confessed.

“Math will attend anyway,” Ana said. “It doesn’t enjoy the social portion, but it hears about fire and refuses to be left out.” Rowan arrived after the wind had gone from impertinent to potentially disqualifying, and he looked worn in a way that made me want to pet the part of his face that pretended it hadn’t noticed. He didn’t reach to touch; he held an extra pair of ear defenders and lifted his eyebrows in the question that had managed not to annoy me yet. I took them and let them become jewelry around my neck.

We learned a new vocabulary for disappointment that afternoon. The hold came, not dramatic but bureaucratic, the way a clerk will tell you your number has been called but for a different window. The word scrub had a sound I could not unhear—a sibilant that thinks it’s doing us a favor. People who had practiced not cheering now practiced not groaning, and the desert kept its face on. Rowan explained nothing because he has, finally, taught himself that I am not soothed by explanations that arrive before my body has decided to listen. Birdie, patron saint of public grief disguised as jokes, bought us coffee that had an aftertaste of courage and looked at the sky with her head tilted the way a mechanic listens to a car idle. “We can clap for the hold,” she said. “It did its job. It kept everyone’s eyebrows.”

“Not everything wants to leave on the day we told it we needed it to,” Ana said, and she did not sound betrayed. “Sometimes the math is a door with a polite sign: back in five.”

We tried again at an hour when light had just decided it could be emotional without being theatrical. The wind made a fist and then placed it on the table and then, maybe out of courtesy, left the room. People did the exact same actions as before and gave them different meaning because that is our species’ favorite game. I inserted the plugs with the reverence of someone who knows why ritual survives and settled the defenders over them like a parent arranges a blanket over a sleeping child who has insisted she isn’t tired. The ignition arrived and the sound lofted every cochlea in a mile radius into an obedience that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with truth. The desert approved not with flowers but with compliance. Birdie’s hand found mine and her knuckles counted off an unnumbered rhythm against my palm that confused the anxious metronome in my chest into softness. The plume lifted a chapter and then another chapter and then turned a page in me I had been using to prop a table leg.

After, the air was a new room and we were inside it even though none of the doors had moved. People made the same rain-noise with their hands and the same startled whoops, but under it I heard something else: the familiarity of a world learning a trick it had always been capable of, the way a child will finally tie a shoe and then tie another one right after because it cannot believe its own fingers. I did not flip anyone off. I forgot how. My middle finger lay down with the rest of me and decided to grow a different callus. When the quiet came, it wore me the way a sweater wears a body—stretched a little at the elbows, warmed at the most insistent places, accepting of the shape because shape is the point.

On the way back the van decided to dramatize its temperature, and we pulled over near a grove of trees slim enough to be coy about shade. The hood steamed with the confidence of a medium saying you have a grandfather who loved you in ways you did not recognize at the time, and Birdie stood with her hands on her hips like she could virtue a thermostat into sense. We waited and ate oranges and let the juice run into our thumbnails until they smelled like other people’s summers. A dust devil rehearsed being a ghost in the field and then quit before it had to invent a backstory. “We can love complicated things,” Birdie said, and she meant men and machines and mornings and names and possibly herself. “We can love them until their tricks stop feeling like threats.” I tried a count to seven just to see if it would bite me. It didn’t. Five wanted to be mango again, and for once I let it.

When we rolled back onto Stockton, the city had put on its afternoon face, the one that makes it look like a festival that forgot to advertise. The sign in the laundromat window had changed while I had been away betraying one sound for another. FOR LEASE hung there with the patience of a sentence that has learned not to shout. My stomach went vertical inside me. The washers stared like open mouths. The owner stood at the counter counting a stack of papers that looked like goodbyes that had just discovered their legal names. He shrugged in a way that refused the idea of villains. The building was leaving its body for another body. The rooms I had trained to listen to me would soon have to learn a different key. Upstairs, my window still held the feather’s weightless allegiance, and the ear defenders looked at me from the table the way a cat looks right before you go to get your suitcase from the closet.

Leticia and I stood at the fence and conducted a quick audit of our different kinds of dread. “I can hear other people’s roosters,” she said by way of solidarity, and we both laughed at how insufficient and perfect it was. We looked at the box with its stripe and its low heart and we agreed that rearrangements can be survivable when you build them at a pace your ribs can imitate. “Maybe you go sleep in the van with your friend for a minute,” she suggested, and the way she said van had nothing to do with vehicles. “Maybe you take the plant with the leaf and tell it the world is about to be taller.”

I walked to Oak Park again like someone folding herself back into an old jacket to see if the sleeves still knew her. The house had not been solved by the name change; the porch still spoke in flake and grit. The same girl with the STAFF shirt sat on the steps blowing her gum into little domes and then collapsing them with a tongue flourish that spoke of practice and focus. “Still same,” she said without the ceremony of good conversationalists. I told her about the box and put the drawing into her hand like a contraband no one will punish you for. I drew the air holes and the latch and the low heart and then I wrote iterate where Ana would have written it, and the girl tilted her head and said, “I like doors that don’t forget they can be doors and boxes that admit they’re rooms if you’re small.” She tucked the paper into a binder with the quiet authority of a person who intends to keep the thing that might help her later, and I left before I could make the mistake of saying anything that sounded like a blessing.

Rowan called on a line that hissed like the ocean pretending it was the past. His voice had had half a night of sleep and half a promise of more. He apologized for nothing and asked for nothing and told me the thing had done the thing and would do it again if asked politely and compensated appropriately. “There was a girl,” he said, and for a second jealousy flared in me out of muscle memory and then went nowhere because I am cultivating a different muscle. “She saw it go and turned to her dad and said, ‘We made a door in the sky,’ and I almost agreed out loud even though my job is to keep my mouth within reasonable bounds.” I told him there was a sign in my window that believed in vacancy and that I was treating that belief like a person treats a neighbor who leaves and keeps the porch light on just in case. “You will be fine,” he said, and the sentence did not insult me because he put no faith in it, only habit. “If you need to put anything heavy somewhere while you move it from one place to another, I have a shop floor with a corner that belongs to nobody and a broom I will pretend to use.”

Birdie’s van, true to her reputation, both failed and did not fail as housing. We parked it on a street with trees that resembled cooperative handshakes and ran an extension cord like a vein from a friend’s first-floor plug. Inside, the curtains rustled like gossip handled kindly, and the smell of eucalyptus did what it always does for me, which is to make me think of a quiet that has not asked permission. We slept crosswise with our feet fighting a little and we woke to neighbor sprinklers confessing to the grass. Birdie peeled the safety pin off her apron and installed it on the van’s sun visor as if this meant something bigger than it did, which is another of our shared skills.

The diner held me the way good furniture accommodates changing weight, and I made breakfast like a person who is auditioning for a stable life and overacts only in the direction of competence. Hector brought the children in the alley a set of washers and taught them how to toss them toward a circle drawn in chalk, and they cheated in the way children cheat, which is to say not secretly but earnestly. Leticia stood at the fence and told me she had decided to try her hand at a few hens now that the rooster’s volume had joined a choir. The plant made a second leaf and I did not throw a party in its honor because some miracles prefer to be called water and sun. The lemon clock apologized in its usual way. The feather stayed.

I did something I had avoided, which was to borrow a tape recorder from the back office, the kind we keep around for the health inspector’s visits, and I took it to Leticia’s yard at the hour when the light goes coinsilver and the rooster knows it still has something to contribute. I recorded him and then I played him back and I watched him tilt his head, the sound of his own authority arriving from a plastic mouth. He crowed over himself, and for a minute the two sounds braided the way my fear and my practice had braided: a helix, yes, but not an obligation. I brought the recorder upstairs and set it beside the ear defenders and the feather, and I felt, for the first time without wincing, like I owned a museum of artifacts from a life I had not entirely survived but had chosen to curate.

When I signed the last rent check for the room above the laundromat, my hand shook less than I thought it would. The owner slid it into a drawer where things go to become memory and thanked me in the polite voice of people you have outgrown without malice. He said the new tenants would be a company that sells boutique detergent with labels that use a font like a whisper, and I allowed myself seventeen seconds of cynicism before admitting that soap is soap and we all want our clothes to smell like the person we wish we were.

On my last night in that small, stubborn room, I lay on the mattress with my jacket tangled around my knees and my hands tented over the bridge of my nose like I could hold up the ceiling if it asked me nicely. The washers breathed below me, and that breath braided itself into the purr of the street as if it had been on the city’s payroll the entire time. The rooster practiced his late set in his dressing room, and the quiet arrived in the wake and folded itself into the corners I couldn’t reach when I am busy pretending to be an instrument. I counted to seven and then backward past mango to both, and then I stopped counting because the numbers had decided to climb their own ladder and did not require my supervision. I closed my eyes and felt the echo of a launch still perched somewhere under my sternum, warm as a creature I had been allowed to keep in spite of paperwork. I told myself, out loud, a sentence I have never trusted but that seemed to want to take a chair: tomorrow is not an audition. It is a day that will arrive with or without your face pressed against the glass. I fell asleep before the rooster could object.

In the morning, the city’s mouth made its usual sounds, and a truck out on Stockton dropped a transmission into the story of the day with a thud that convinced me anew that we are all allowed our entrance. Birdie banged on the van and handed me a paper cup of coffee that was trying to be friendly, and we stood in the threshold of between and pretended not to be sentimental. “Do we cry,” she asked, and then rolled her eyes at herself. “Fine, we don’t cry. We perspire at the face.” We loaded my drawings and the plant and the feather and the ear defenders and the lemon clock’s ghost into the spaces where they promised to sit still, and Leticia came to the fence and made a small motion with her hand like she was blessing us without admitting to the practice. The rooster lifted his foot and set it down as if to stamp a passport. I put my hand over the latch to his dressing room and thanked it for holding, and then we got in the van and drove, not out of the city exactly, not out in the sense that the story ends when the road changes, but toward a place where the air would not be better or worse, just different enough to make me say thank you to the part of myself that had finally recognized the shape of departure without flinching.Chapter eight began in heat and cardboard, in the kind of light that makes even honest objects look like props. We were outside the old place wiry with second thoughts and carrying my life down the stairs as if it might change its mind halfway and climb back up. Birdie had parked the van at a diagonal like someone who refused to make the world’s angles easy. She wore a T-shirt that had begun life as a joke about coffee and become a smock for minor reinventions. I made five trips with five boxes—books, drawings, the lemon clock’s ghost, the ear defenders that had learned the shape of my neck, and the plant with its radical belief in leaf. The feather rode in my back pocket like a private dare. The owner watched me from behind the tempered glass of the counter and I could see in his expression the relief of someone whose building had begun to refer to him in the past tense. We shook hands in that quick, dry way that means we are trying not to leave fingerprints on each other, and I wanted to tell him that I had learned to sleep in his stairwell and it wasn’t nothing, but gratitude always misjudges its timing with me, so I waved and put my shoulder to the last box instead.

We did not have a destination that day so much as an agreement to keep moving towards a general concept of elsewhere. Birdie had heard of a place on V Street where a retired sign painter rented out his upstairs rooms to people who could carry what they owned. He was said to accept cash and stories and to be strict about the latter. We drove with the windows open and let the spring of hot air argue its case against our hair. The city took the change in stride, as usual. It threw me a sequence of small confirmations: a woman on a bicycle carrying a bag of oranges the color of a decision, a man on a stoop with a book in his lap and his finger preserving a page for a friend, a kid in a cape elaborately failing to fly. The sign outside the church that had once declared God Is Not Mad had been fixed and now simply read God Is; I liked the involuntary theology of that, the way a neon failure had given us a better sentence we were not entitled to.

The sign painter’s building was brick you could trust and a stoop with a shallow step that told the truth about knees. His shop window offered an exhibit of alphabets that had been beautiful on grocery store windows and soda fountains and now only existed behind a pane like tropical birds in a museum. A gilt R leaned in the corner with the pride of a retired athlete. He opened the door with a rag in one hand and a cat in the other, and both of them looked at us with bored curiosity, like we were a subject that had already been taught this semester. He introduced himself as Walt and the cat as Moxie, and then he asked what kind of tenants we were with the kind of steadiness only an old man can make sound like a compliment.

“The kind that pours coffee at a level the law should regulate and pays their rent on a schedule that would impress a metronome,” I said, and Birdie added that she was a seasonal saint and a permanent inconvenience and that together we could be trusted to turn down the music before midnight.

Walt nodded as if he had been waiting to hear those exact words, and he walked us up a stair that had learned to sing. The landing had a window that stared fiercely at a tree like it wanted to catch it doing something it could sketch. The room was a room, which is to say it contained air with the usual rights and responsibilities and a floor that had opinions. Two windows let themselves glow as if auditioning for a role in a better movie. There was a sink that looked like it had once consoled a boxer and a corner big enough to be a plan. It smelled faintly of varnish and rain that had heard rumors and never bothered to check them. I stood and looked at it as if I had to convince it that I would be a reasonable person in its body.

“I have opinions about holes in the wall,” Walt said, and his eyes flicked to the rolled drawings sticking like ribs out of one of my boxes. “You can put up what you want so long as you are considerate with your holes. Moxie will inspect whether you take shoes off. She will not tell you her conclusions but she will publish.”

I wanted to tell him he had just described God, and in a way I did by smiling. I touched the window as if I could test how well it held onto sky. From below, the sign painter’s alphabets made a quiet fuss. Birdie walked to the sink and ran the water and decided it had promise. The van, visible out the window like a toy car a child left in a hurry, gave us the comfort of something temporarily obedient. Walt named a number that was not cruel and we named a day that was tomorrow and we shook on it and for once I did not need to steal my hand back like a child who has resolved not to trust adults without a signed note.

We lived in the van that night anyway because it felt transitional to do so, like we were honoring the physics of thresholds. We parked under a maple that had rustled its way through enough summers to know that shade is a currency best spent carelessly. Birdie turned the back into a stage and then into a bed and then into a confession booth. She slept with one arm flung over her face like a curtain and I lay next to her with my hands on my stomach like I was holding down a map. The city did its nighttime impersonation of itself and we breathed along with it until we didn’t. When morning arrived it arrived, as always, underhanded and accurate, the rooster’s declaration traveling across neighborhoods like an AM station, and my lungs did their old trick of trying to leave my body through the top of my head and then remembering they lived here. I lay and waited and the silence came like a second pulse and settled in my palms where I could count it. I didn’t look at Birdie but I knew she was awake by the way one leg twitched like a horse resenting a fly.

We hauled the boxes the next day with that slow comedy moving requires. Walt stood at the top of the stairs with a folded towel like a maître d’ of exertion. The cat viewed us with the professional disdain of someone whose species has been worshiped and not without cause. I put the plant on the windowsill and it immediately made it clear the light was passable and the view negotiable. I hung the ear defenders on the back of the single chair so they could pass for art. The feather I balanced on the frame of the window itself, precariously enough to remind me not to slam anything. I set the lemon clock’s ghost above the sink and it ticked in an attitude I recognized, which is to say determined and unnecessary.

When you move into a place that has already been alive without you, there is a choreography you learn quickly if you’re not trying to be tragic. Where the floor sighs when you step and where it courts your foot with a secret spring. Where the light prefers to land and where it refuses even when you suggest with offerings. Which corner will always smell like optimism and which has a permanent whiff of undertow. The kitchen made exactly the number of noises I could forgive. The sound of the stair in the late afternoon did something agreeable to my spine. Outside, the sign painter’s steady hand spelled out groceries into a name again and again until the word forgot it meant anything and remembered.

I was not expecting the trains. They came in the evening like a procession of sovereigns and shook the glass in a way that woke both the alarmed child and the soothed animal in me. The first one walked right through my chest and I had to sit down. Birdie laughed into her sleeve because she can’t help puncturing drama before it gets dull, and then she put a hand on my forearm and the pressure made the sound go somewhere else inside me, somewhere with a rug. It was, of course, a different kind of loud. It had purpose and distance. It didn’t lacerate the same internal geography as the birds did. It leaned in and said, move or move. By the third train I had discovered that if I put my fingertips on the windowpane right before the whistle arrived my bones would vibrate with a noble intention and I would forget, temporarily, that I have been afraid of the wrong things most of my life.

Work did not mind that my address had changed because work doesn’t ask you where you sleep unless it’s late and you are telling it a lie on a stool. The lemon clock made its soft, apologetic penance and the grill hissed like a living thing pretending it wasn’t and Uncle Ned let slip the word sweetheart to the bacon and then glared at me for noticing. The counter became more of a stage and less of a trench now that I had a place to go home to that didn’t smell like other people’s stubborn. The broken-up couple came back together quietly and sat in their old booth and looked at each other like they had been assigned as lab partners by a teacher with a grudge. A man read the newspaper upside down and smiled the private smile of someone who preferred the world that way. I practiced pouring coffee with my wrist like it was a hinge I was proud of, and I only spilled it when the day had already proved I wasn’t going to cry.

Hector approved of the new room by immediately finding its best echo. He went into the corner by the sink and said his own name like it was both an announcement and an apology and then he listened to the way the room returned it, and he told me that my new life had a generous acoustic. He produced from nowhere an egg carton full of tiny succulents that looked like small, determined tongues and arranged them under the window as if he’d been assigned the role of green. He also had, while we were not looking, befriended Walt by asking him about his curves and his flourishing line, and asking an old man about his craft is as efficient a seduction as a pie. Before he left, he hung a small ladder he had made out of wire near the door and told me it was a scale, not a metaphor, and when I raised an eyebrow he said he had not been born yesterday, he knew I was going to use it for both.

Leticia visited after her shift at the school, wearing a blue shirt that made her look like the sky had borrowed her for the day. She brought tamales in foil and a story about her neighbor’s nephew and a hen that insisted on sleeping on top of a cooler because once something has convinced you of itself, you are not obligated to examine other methods of being. We sat on the floor and ate with our hands and the rooster’s voice arrived from a softer distance, as if it had learned I was making an effort and did not wish to embarrass me in front of a guest. She looked around the room and made a sound that lives somewhere between a sigh and a very short laugh, and she told me the dressing room had saved her from despising a bird she had been assigned like an heirloom with bad manners. “He thinks he’s a god,” she said, which was precise and did not require an argument. “Now he has a temple. Small, but with a door.”

Ana wrote a postcard from a town with a name like a handful of screws, all hard letters and pragmatic vowels. The card showed a photograph of a white line painted down a runway, the kind of composition that wants to be an allegory but ends up merely earnest. She wrote on the back in her engineer’s hand that math had, at last, conceded a point about thermal management and that she had never been prouder of convincing numbers to be more like people for an afternoon. There was a P.S. in which she admitted she had eaten pie for breakfast twice and both times felt like a revolutionary, and there was a notch in the paper where her pencil had pressed too hard right at the word quiet. I pinned it under the wire ladder because letters are a kind of rung and I am, at long last, not opposed to climbing when it won’t get me killed.

Rowan texted a photograph that was, predictably, a poor photograph of a beautiful thing. The thing was a piece of sky that had agreed to allow a small object to leave it for a minute, and the photograph looked like grief that had developed a blossom. He wrote nothing except a time and a set of initials and a single sentence that went, still building. I wrote back, not immediately, because a pause is the only weapon I’m comfortable wielding, and when I did I wrote, still watching, and then I put my phone under a book so it would have to make an effort to bother me. He did not reply and I did not get ill with the not replying, and in the middle of that small success I knew I had graduated from one tiny classroom with poor lighting into another with windows.

On moving day plus three, Moxie decided to lay a claim and did so by walking straight across my chest in the middle of the night and sitting on my diaphragm until I learned who was in charge of breath. I opened one eye and saw her enormous pupils set to the setting called cathedral and felt a laugh elbow its way up through my ribs until the cat, annoyed with the behavior of my furniture, moved to the pillow and went instantly to that concentrated sleep cats govern like emperors. Morning arrived through the screens like it had paid its taxes. The trains announced themselves modestly and the rooster located me a neighborhood away and tried out a new riff and whenever I thought I had settled one sound into the bowl another came along to see how it had been done. I counted to six because six and I have a contract, and then I walked the count backward just to see if the numbers could be persuaded into the shape of a hammock.

Around the fifth day the room revealed its corner of grief. It was the spot near the closet where the paint had been done over a bad job and the floor held an argument under it. I sat there in the late afternoon and let the place tell me about the people who had slept badly in it before me. There was a woman who loved a man with a limp that wasn’t physical and who’d learned to wash his shirts to a particular softness that made no difference to anything but her hands. There was a kid who stared up into the ceiling and made deals with plaster and the plaster had been precise in its limits. There was a man who kept his shoes by the bed pointed toward the door as if he wanted to save time in an emergency. I do not think I am mystical, but wood keeps records the way riverbanks do, and the way my body loosens under certain frequencies makes me believe there is a ledger somewhere, and we are given to read it if the light does the right trick on the page.

Birdie and I worked on the arrangement of joy. We put the table under the window where the sun could be reprimanded by a vase. We pulled a rug out of the van that had been a rug at least five times before and shook it until its previous owners let go. We wrote rules on the inside of a cupboard with chalk that could be erased without discouraging anyone. The rules were small and had more verbs than nouns. One: eat over the sink sometimes because sometimes is sacrament. Two: do not allow guilt to outnumber forks. Three: if the room gives you back your name when you say it, thank it. Four: if anyone knocks on the door and you do not wish to open it, you must still be polite to yourself. Five: let the feather stay until it wishes to travel. Six: mango when necessary. Seven: both.

We took the bus to the river on a day the world had dyed itself the color of a new bruise. The water had the decency to look like it had a destination. We sat on the steps that went down into it as if the city wanted to give people their baptisms back, and we put our ankles in and then more of us, and there is something about being permitted to submerge an error and let the current carry certain syllables away that makes a person briefly good. A man in a straw hat had trained his dog to leap over strangers’ outstretched legs on a whistle and the dog performed like a humble courtier. An older woman with a cane shouted the names of birds at the top of her lungs and then apologized to them for being so loud. A teenager with headphones practiced doing nothing while pretending to be occupied and might have been the best of us at it. We stayed there until the sky gave up on trying to be an argument and became just plain sky.

By the second week of living above alphabets, I realized I had begun to draw the trains. The pencil lines wanted the barrel-chested slope of the engine, but they were cowards about it, so I drew the little one who follows, the one nobody notices because it looks like a mistake with wheels. I drew the ladders that run up the sides and then I drew them again on a different scale, and then I drew the ladder inside my palm from memory and laughed because I had made myself a cliche and the cliche had learned how to juggle. I drew the lemon clock in the corner of the page because it refuses to be forgotten even in ghost form. I drew a square with air holes and under it I wrote iterate because I like borrowing words from people who can make them pay rent.

The rooster kept to his schedule as if the city were a set of gears someone had bothered to service. Occasionally he would throw in a double crow, a quick succession like a prank, and I would allow myself to be annoyed because annoyance is a right you get to keep even after the therapy of sound. Leticia installed a string of solar lights in the yard that made the evening look like a shy carnival and she sent me a picture of the rooster blinking at the new constellations she had hung for him and I surprised myself by writing back, he looks handsome, like I was the kind of person who had achieved detente with beauty that had once hurt me. She replied with a string of knife emojis and a heart, which is to say she understands what anyone can be trusted to understand.

One afternoon, when the heat slung its arm across the city with the entitlement of an uncle, Walt called me down to the shop. He had spread a roll of paper across the worktable and weighted it with a coffee cup and a can of linseed oil, and he gestured me nearer the way a magician chooses a volunteer he has already recruited. He had letters in pencil that he was coaxing into readiness for a grocery’s door. He showed me his R and his S, the way he made their bellies and tails, and he told me how hands learn to talk to paint and how paint, if you’ve been faithful to it, will gossip on your behalf to the surface. He even let me pull a stroke, guided by his hand, the way a father might steady a child’s bike while she tries to desire forwardness. My line was humble and insincere but it felt like a sentence I could believe in later. “Every letter,” he said, “knows something about breath. People forget that. You can’t ask an A to carry you through a word if you starve it. You must leave it its air.” He looked at me like he had found my lungs in there somewhere on the table and wanted me to know their names.

That night the trains were late and my body, darling animal that it is, tried to invent the absence into a crisis, and then it failed because absence straightened itself into the same bowl I had learned to lean my face into and the quiet did its rounds. Birdie was not home because sometimes she went to visit her other names, and the room made a small offer of yes. I lay in the dark and made the list of what I had learned to love without forcing and was startled to find the roster had more than two members. Some things still refused. I still wanted certain apologies arranged in certain fonts on certain letterhead. I still measured what I survived in secret units, and I still slept with my shoes coaxed close to the door on nights when a dream had the wrong kind of light in it. But there was something else under that now, like a dependable subfloor under an old, stubborn rug, and I could breathe down to it. If I were a house—and I pretend this with frequency unbecoming to someone who knows she is not wood—I would finally admit I had load-bearing walls.

On a Sunday, a day that behaved itself in half with rain, I allowed myself a kind of church and went back to Oak Park and stood on the sidewalk and watched a kid fly his idea of an airplane around his head in loops so extravagant they made the neighbors benevolent. The house had acquired a new sign with a slightly less intense leaf, and a woman with a scar that had done its job opened the door to the same loud hinge and grinned at me as if we had already traded biographies. The screen door had learned a new sound, which I resented and then forgave because we are allowed to improve in small audible ways. The girl with the STAFF shirt had graduated to a more complicated role; she wore a lanyard that said nothing particular and did a loop with a ring of keys that told me she had learned to make the doors get along. I left a copy of the rectangle with air holes in the mailbox because I am a coward about direct gifts, and I walked away and let the rain adopt me. On the way back I said hi to the palm trees that had served as my jury for years and they nodded in their tall, silly way that convinces me daily that grace has no dress code.

Sometimes Rowan’s name would drift across the day like the shadow of a large bird I could not see, and instead of ducking I would stand still until the shade moved on. Sometimes Ana would send an equation with a note that said, look where it failed to follow orders, and I would stare at the figures and think, you are not the only ones failing to obey your own logic. Sometimes Hector would leave a paper boat on my doorstep with the word both written on the sail and I would put it on the windowsill until Moxie decided she had editorial privileges. Sometimes the rooster would hit a note that made me think of an engine and the engine would make a claim on me I was tempted to believe, and sometimes the trains would reconcile this without my consent. Through all of it I found I had begun to speak to mornings with fewer negotiations and evenings with fewer bribes, and between them I could put a ladder and not break my ankle on it.

We did not throw a housewarming because I do not believe I am warmed by crowds, but we did perform a rite. Birdie brought a cake that had never been sensible; it was frosted in a color that exists to remind you you are not in charge of the palette. Leticia brought a small potted rosemary with a tag that read for thinking and for meat. Walt brought a can of primer and a story about the time he painted a dragon on the side of a diner in 1973 and the dragon is now a flower because the city prefers its myths less obvious. Hector brought a box of chalk and drew a hopscotch on my floor that began at yes and ended at both and skipped all the numbers in between. Ana was not there because you cannot ask orbit to come to cake, but she texted a picture of her calculator with the word iterate entered ten times and then cleared on purpose. Rowan did not appear because he is learning to be a citizen of other places, but a postcard arrived two days later with a drawing of a bird that I did not hate. We ate the cake and the rosemary made the room decide to remember kitchens it had never had, and the primer stayed unopened because no one wants to bless a wall until they know what exact shape their mistakes will take.

Later, when everyone had gone back to their own arrangements, I stood at the window with my hands flat against the glass like the city might need me to steady it. The evening did that thing where it forgets to undo the day and simply layers on top. I could see the painted G, the one with the flourish, watching me like a cousin you trust more than your parents. I could smell the train before I could hear it. The rooster tried out his late set somewhere to the south and the quiet came and I let it, then the engine put its hand through the room and I let that too, and for a minute everything I had made into enemies stood around my bed and nodded to one another like they had been sent an invitation after all. I lay back and put my hands on the grid of my ribs. I counted to six and then to mango and then to both. I did not need to tell anyone I had managed it. The lemon clock apologized itself toward midnight and I did not forgive it and it did not require me to.

A week later I made a table. That sentence sounds like someone who owns a shed and a subscription to a magazine that uses wood as an adjective, but in fact I laid a door across two sawhorses Hector found in an alley and I sanded the door’s old conversation out of it and I set two cups on it like eyes. Walt came up with a brush in his mouth and a can of paint in one hand and he looked at the door with respect, as if even repurposed objects deserve the courtesy of being recognized as having had a former life. He painted a border around the edge, a line as thin as a promise and meant more than that. He told me I could eat on a door forever if I chose, that he had eaten on worse, that sometimes the best meal a person gets is on a vague surface held up by someone else’s optimism, and I accepted this doctrine like a person with experience.

In the afternoon, I visited the river and found a boy with yellow wings made of cardboard arguing with physics on the low wall. He had that fierce, doomed look of someone who has not yet learned the word iterate and thinks joy is a one-time event. I asked him if he needed a hand and he informed me gruffly he had an agreement with air that did not include witnesses. I stayed anyway but moved to the respectful distance and I watched him choose again and again not to jump, then finally to jump poorly and survive in a way that will become a better story later. On my way back, I stopped at the market and bought tomatoes and basil and a small bottle of oil that had decided to be expensive, and the woman who rang me up told me the basil had been bullied by the weather that morning and might need reassurance. I took it home and reassured it and ate like a person who had registered to vote in the party of sensation.

The first letter to the new address arrived addressed to the wrong name, which is to say it arrived exactly right. It was a catalogue no one had asked for, full of clothes for a life I will not lead but will dress in occasionally in my head. The models looked like the kind of people who learned to sleep on planes with a face that did not humiliate them, and the dresses were all simple lies. I tore out a page with a coat that looked like a hug you only needed when you had already been forgiven, and I taped it inside the cupboard with the chalk rules, and it looked good there, a promise for winter I did not have to believe.

At dusk, a child walked down the sidewalk under my window and sang a song to herself with a refrain that included the words rocket ship and rooster and mango, and I leaned out and said, that’s a good song, and she corrected me to say it was an anthem and that she would be taking it on tour once she learned to ride her bike without hating the pedals. I applauded privately and the trains gave her percussion and the city lifted a corner of its mouth. I have been wrong about most things on first pass and I am learning to enjoy the second.

Birdie went away for a few days to consult with a cousin whose life was currently boiling, and she left me her van key like a talisman, as if to say we can all sleep somewhere unadmitted if we need to. In the evenings without her commentary my room grew a new silence, taller and less domesticated, and instead of crowding it with music I let it stand and we looked at each other and decided not to pick a fight. I kept my hands busy with petty administration and with drawing letters the way Walt preferred them drawn and with re-mapping the scars I carry to be sure none of them had moved of their own accord. I wrote a postcard addressed to nobody and then mailed it to Leticia’s fence, which is to say it made its own way to her and she texted me a photograph of it tucked under the heart in the dressing room where it would keep company with math and feathers. The rooster stared at the postcard suspiciously and then, perhaps, recognized my handwriting.

If there is a sentence I am practicing until it becomes muscle, it is this: I am in the middle and the middle is good. People sometimes say middles like a problem, like something you must strategize your way out of. They think beginnings are miracles and endings are grace when mostly it is all a slosh. But today, with my plant attempting leaf three and the trains arguing in a way that does not require me to take sides and the rooster adjusting his volume like a person finally receiving therapy, with the sign painter making flourishes below and the cat deciding my shoulder is furniture and the ear defenders hanging like headphones a saint might use, with the feather gaining nothing and losing nothing from its prolonged residency—today it feels like a privilege to not be beginning and to refuse to end. I don’t have to explain that to anyone. I can let the room explain it to me.

On a night that meant nothing to anyone but me, I set my chair in front of the window and watched the city conduct its orchestra like a tired genius. Someone shouted an apology in the alley to someone who had already forgiven them. A siren went by performing a play it had rehearsed. A cyclist in a reflective vest made a private bargain with survival that satisfied both parties. In the room behind me the lemon clock ticked its penitent tick and in the room ahead of me the trains asserted their old, generous argument and between them I could feel the moment gather its breath. I put my hands on the architecture of my ribs and for once did not count. I let the sound arrive and the after arrive and the space between teach me that the thing that saves you will not always be quieter than the thing that hurt you, but it will be patient. And then I went to sleep like someone stepping across a threshold into a room that had been holding its shape for her the whole time, and I dreamed a ladder that lay gently down in a field and, finally, let the grass climb it.Chapter ten arrived in a heat that made the paint soften around the window frames and remember its childhood. The room developed a baked smell like old bread, and downstairs Walt propped his door open with a gallon of primer as if white could cool anything. The power went out just before dusk and the city made that surprised hush that tells you how much of the noise you hear is machines pretending to be weather. For a full minute the trains forgot to be sovereigns, and the quiet rose high and thin as a lid lifted and set back down. Moxie expanded into a long question mark on the floorboards and then rolled back into certainty when the air moved. Out on the sidewalk everyone performed being casual about losing their lights, and then relief turned our hands into lanterns when Leticia walked down the block carrying a string of solar bulbs that had fattened themselves responsibly all afternoon. She looped them along the fence with the authority of a stage manager and our street put on a little carnival of low light without demanding applause.

We carried chairs outside because air feels improved by the presence of furniture. Birdie fanned herself with a takeout menu like a woman in an early play about steel magnolias and told the heat we believed it. Walt dragged up a portable radio the size of a dictionary and tuned it to a station that offered weather in a tone of voice that implied the weather had been intentionally rude. The rooster threw his voice into the dim and it arrived shaved down by his dressing room, and the sound slid over us without catching on our ribs. Children appeared as if their pockets made them. One of them, a girl wearing a T-shirt that said FUTURE PASTOR in glitter letters, asked if the blackout was a teaching moment and her father said yes and offered her a warm orange soda from a bag filled with other bad decisions. I passed her one of Leticia’s real oranges and showed her how to carve the skin down in spirals with a plastic knife, and the peel fell away like a bracelet you forgive for being cheap. When the first train finally remembered itself and pushed a cool breath across the city, we all exhaled in a way that made me feel I had mastered something I hadn’t. Somewhere past the curve of the block a woman sang to her baby and the tune traveled like a polite rumor.

The morning after is my favorite part of a small disaster. People return the city to itself with a tenderness that always makes me think of new sheets. Walt swung his gate wide and announced that he’d taken a job painting a bakery window and needed a second hand that could be trusted to obey the curve. He put a brush in my palm the way you put a coin in a slot and he showed me how to load it with just enough paint to promise fidelity. We practiced on paper first. He had me make a hundred ovals, each one wanting to be an O, each one a little more honest than the last. When my breath went shallow my lines went mean, and when I remembered to find the bottom of my lungs with a private count the loops became generous. The ampersand gave me the most grief, which felt correct. Walt traced one with a finger in the air, not performative, only precise. “It’s a marriage with a knot,” he said, tapping where the line folds back on itself, “and a path that keeps moving anyway.” I made the ampersand twice the wrong way and then once the way a body likes to turn when it isn’t being watched, and Walt grunted in the language of old men satisfied not to have wasted their morning.

At the bakery, flour lived in the air like a soft weather front, and the woman behind the counter wore her hair in a bun that would have embarrassingly improved any painting. She stood watch over our stencils with a seriousness reserved for ovens and loved ones. I did the light things and Walt did the decisive things and together we coaxed letters onto glass until the words told the truth about bread. The window asked for the ampersand in the middle of Butter & Flour and I put it there like a hinge and practiced believing two could share a sentence without fighting over pronouns. When we were done, the baker fed us almond croissants that tried to teach my mouth a better religion, and Walt told me a story about a sign he’d painted for a roller rink in 1978 that included a lightning bolt and a promise to come back and fix the S if it ever began to complain.

At the diner that week we ran a midnight breakfast for the lineworkers who had convinced the substation not to sulk. They came in wearing the kind of tired that doesn’t hope to be admired, and the room rose to meet them by turning its lights up one unnecessary notch. I wrote down orders with a fervor that felt like prayer disguised as inventory. The generator in the alley rattled with the loyalty of a friend’s old truck, and its sound pressed the kitchen thin while Uncle Ned’s griddle spit an amen every time bacon learned its lesson. The lemon clock did its penitent clicking and I counted a private six while I cracked eggs, then a private both as the batter spread to the edge of the iron. When the men with vests lifted their coffee cups in a little salute to nobody in particular, something in me stood up straighter and let the satisfaction land without turning it into debt.

Leticia knocked on my door two nights after the lights returned because a raccoon with ambitions had discovered the dressing room and had written an essay on the latch in the language of scratches. We went out together, barefoot and pretending not to be alarmed, and found the animal in the act of composing a second draft. The rooster had retreated to the highest shelf with the dignity of a bothered statesman. Hector arrived ghostlike with a headlamp and a length of rope that bought us authority we had not previously possessed, and he made an advisory perimeter with the rope like a magician keeping a ring honest. The raccoon looked like a burglar who had once been a professor; its hands had manners. It retreated without being dramatic, and we stood under the solar bulbs with our hearts trying to convince our brains to give them a parade. I held the latch in my palm and thought about the math of pressure and angles, and the next day Ana sent a drawing in a text, a doodle with a note that said, “change the catch to a gravity lock; raccoons don’t read that language,” and we did, and she was right, as usual. Rowan, not to be left out of any problem that involved metal, mailed a rectangle of aircraft scrap with countersunk holes, and Hector mounted it like he was bargaining with a gate into heaven.

In the weeks that followed, the trains took to announcing themselves three minutes later than anyone had asked them to, as if someone in a distant office had negotiated for kindness. I learned the new rhythm and caught my breath on the upbeats. Birdie discovered the exact spot on my floor where she could sit and hear three different radios at once, one from the shop, one from a car that refused to age, and one from a neighbor who preferred baseball called quietly. She hums harmony without trying and sometimes the room harmonizes with her. She came home from a weekend away with a small scar over one knuckle and a grin that indicated the scar belonged to a story that did not require witnesses. She kissed the top of my head like I was being ridiculous about an onion and told me she was considering taking a night class in locksmithing because she believed doors wanted to be understood. I told her I would frame her certificate with an ampersand and she said she would hang it by the window where thieves could read it and reconsider themselves.

The girl with the STAFF shirt found me at the market under a tent that sold citrus with philosophical ambition. She had a clipboard and an expression that meant she had been deputized. She asked me if I would come talk to the kids one afternoon about drawing, about how you can make a line and trust it not to betray you even when your hand can’t stop telling you lies. I stalled in the ways I know, which include pretending I had lost the date and needed to find it under a stack of napkins, then relented because a person who has built a dressing room for a bird owes the world a small talk. I brought paper ripped out of the back of order pads and a fistful of pencils and the napkin with the ladder Hector had drawn, and I sat in the room that used to be a room where I learned I was being watched and I watched back. The kids refused to be good. I loved them all at once with the intensity of a poor flame. I drew rectangles with air holes for them and wrote iterate where Ana would have, and a boy with a tooth loose in the front said, “It looks like a room for a secret that isn’t heavy,” and I told him he could design churches if he wanted, and he said he was more of a food truck guy. I showed them the grid on my palm and told them sometimes fences are just measuring devices if you hold them right, and nobody asked me which parts hurt, which felt like the deepest respect of all.

Rowan called one late afternoon when the window had gone gold in a way that would make any human confess. His voice came through tired and threaded with a contentment he hadn’t paid for. They were rolling the small thing to a larger horizon. He did not invite me to a place I could say yes or no to; he described, dryly, the part where fuel behaves badly and then behaves and the part where a valve loves you for exactly one second more than the money said it should. I listened with my ear to the phone like I was pressing my face against armor. I told him there had been a raccoon and he laughed softly and told me engineers have a phrase for creatures who intrude on test sites that does not sound kind, and I told him not to use it in my house. We said nothing for a while and let the trains adjudicate the pause. When we hung up he texted the single word breathe and for once I did not invent insult out of it. I went to the river and pretended it were a telephone to something enormous, and I said hello to it and it said what rivers always say, which is prove it.

The lemon clock finally fell off the diner wall the way old gods do, protesting as much as they can, then becoming artifacts. It bounced once, bravely, and the glass fractured into a geometry that suddenly made me admire chaos, then Uncle Ned kissed his teeth and told it faintly that he’d put the old bastard out of its misery himself if it hadn’t had the decency to take a dive. We swept it up with a care that felt like affection, and Walt offered to paint a new face that would not betray us. He brought in a circle he had cut from MDF and he stood at the counter with a brush the width of a promise and wrote numbers on the world. He made the twelve with a flourish and the six with restraint, which seems to be how men survive. He let me pull the line that connected the twelve to the six and I did it slow, an umbilical cord through noon and midnight, and he did not correct me because there are times when correction is an insult to the piece. We hung it and it ticked with an authority I recognized from Leticia’s yard, the sound of a small thing insisting, and Uncle Ned nodded once as if absolution had been served along with the pie.

Heat came back as if it had been offended we’d lived without it for a few days. The room learned how to hold shade like a breath and I rotated the plant a quarter turn every morning because I am now a person who understands light is directional and preferences can be cultivated. The ear defenders watched me from their hook, neither accusing nor urging. There were nights I wore them for the comfort of weight, five minutes at a time, then took them off so the city could court me unfiltered. Moxie began sleeping behind my knees as if to teach me the shape of permission. Walt loaned me a stool that had belonged to his wife who had taught letters to first graders in 1963 and who had a stern opinion about the correct boundaries of a C. I drew C’s until my hand stung pleasantly and then I drew the curve where it wants to become an O and thought about the ways we all resist becoming closed.

Hector staged a ceremony in the alley behind the diner for the neighborhood kids who had managed a summer without breaking their bones. He called it Graduation for the Use of Gravity. He built a low slack line between two poles and let them walk it in socks while he told them in a steady voice that falling is a verb humans have romanticized past reason. He said they could practice balance without making it important, and when each child stepped down he gave them a coin stacked on a washer and the washer stacked on another washer and he told them the trick had nothing to do with magnets. I tried it and failed, then tried it and failed more beautifully, which is another of Hector’s favorite phrases. The rooster crowed once in the middle of it as if to nominate himself principal, and everyone clapped derisively, which is perhaps the only language birds do not bother to learn.

On a stormless night that bent toward autumn, the trains stopped for longer than a pause and the quiet arranged itself around our block like furniture that matched. People peered out their windows as if the world had called their names. In the absence of steel and horn I could hear something I had only suspected: the soft slap of the river against its constraints, the sigh of the big palm a street over settling each frond into a personal resolve, the dryer from some apartment with a bad seal spinning a last load for someone who had always intended to fold it. I went to the window and put my fingertips to the glass and thought about how many times in the last year I had pressed my hand against a surface and believed it remembered me. Birdie came in without knocking, her hair wet with a curiosity she hadn’t had time to towel, and we stood there like two witnesses auditioning for a better story and failing to care if we didn’t get the part. She told me we were due for the kind of weather that requires nothing except respect, and I put a hand on my ribs and said thank you to the machinery anyway.

The sign painter woke up one morning with a cough that sounded like a sentence that couldn’t find its predicate. He was not very tall but he made the bed look small, which is a way of reminding a person how much weight a name can carry. I brought him soup that refused to be heroic and he ate it without lying. He told me where he kept the pattern for ampersands because he did not want me to imagine he was the only person allowed to make the world say both, and when he fell asleep Moxie went to sit in the window like the idea of a sentry. I stood in the shop and listened to the radio report the temperature in a voice that had learned manners, and I laid fresh gold leaf over the thin places in the R leaning in the corner and felt the thrill of not ruining something that had been entrusted to me. Later, when he woke, he told me his wife used to say that gold only behaves for people who have practiced losing without pretending it was fair, and I told him I would try to earn even the tin.

One afternoon my old room above the laundromat showed up in a dream and asked me if I was sure. In the dream, the washers were gentle and full of lemons, which is not how washers behave, and the quarter machine gave me change in feathers and screws. I woke with my mouth dry and the trains forgiving, and I dropped the feather from my windowsill in my palm and balanced it against the pressure that comes from being a living thing. It weighed less than any thought I could remember having and still it moved the air when I blew at it, and I took that as a sign I should not be so impressed by the heavy ideas in my head. I put it back and it did what it has always done, which is to be there or not be there without needing my narrative to hold it down.

Ana sent me a photograph of an equation that had embarrassed her and under it she wrote, “surrendered to practical limitations, will send diagram for cuts,” which is how she apologizes to herself for being mortal. She followed it with a picture of a small cake with sparklers stuck in it and a woman I didn’t know grinning like scientists are allowed, and I texted back a rectangle with air holes and the word iterate and thought about how friendship is sometimes just a way of pushing pictures at each other until you’ve admitted you’re alive. Rowan did not send anything for a month and then he mailed a paper airplane made of a flattened blueprint with the word both written on one wing and my name on the other, and when I set it on the windowsill Moxie knocked it off and hid it under the radiator to age it properly.

In a fit of bravery disguised as housekeeping, I called my original name out loud in the room and waited to see what shape it would make in the corners. It didn’t knock anything down. It didn’t even smudge the new paint. It hung for a moment on the ampersand Walt had let me steal, then settled into the cupboard where the chalk rules are not laws and the photograph of the coat waits patiently for winter, then fell apart the way a sugar packet does when you open it and let the grains be themselves. I told Birdie later and she raised a toast with her root beer to the idea that names get to be tools, not chains, and she christened my plant with a pun I won’t repeat because I am trying to behave.

The day I ate a tomato over the sink and let the salt make it humble, the boy with cardboard wings reappeared at the river with something better: a kite made of receipt paper and will. He had tied its spine out of lemon tree switch, and the string was the blue twine they wrap gossip in at bakeries. He let me hold it while he retied the tail with a concentration that would make a mathematician quit and go to sea. When I lifted my hand a little the kite obeyed with a dignity that suggested he had not been wrong about air all along. We flew it until my fingers wanted the rope to stop telling them what to be, and he told me he was saving his allowance for a book about knots because sometimes a person needs to make sure a thing will stay with them long enough to be useful. I told him he could borrow mine, though I did not own one, and then I went home and made a promise to myself to learn one knot that would not betray me, which is as ambitious as I get these days.

I thought I was free of the market until a Saturday when the Lasagna Lady wore a new shirt that said Love Language of Leftovers and I felt seen in a way that probably shouldn’t make anyone cry. The man who once impersonated a rooster saw me and flushed a shade of contrition I respected and he came over and said, “I did not know,” which is almost always the case. I wanted to tell him he didn’t need to know, that this was all between me and light, me and volume, me and a bird who had believed his power came from the sharpness of his throat. Instead I asked him about his tomatoes and he told me their whole convoluted childhoods, and when he laughed he didn’t try to shape the air into any particular weapon. It felt like a truce for people who weren’t meant to keep score.

In the middle of all this middle, a letter arrived from a bureaucratic office with an acronym that could have been either benevolent or predatory. It told me I owed a small debt to a moment I had forgotten to transact and I owed it in a way that would require my presence in a building that never closes its blinds. I stood with the paper in my hand and felt the old systems in my body pull themselves up into formation, an army that had been retired and still put on uniforms when the parade came to town. I told them to stand down with my best math voice. I went to Walt’s and asked for a pen that writes like a person who knows better, and I wrote back in my clearest loops, and when I went to the building the woman behind the glass liked my handwriting enough to look at my face and then hand me a form that did not want to harm me. I left with a receipt and what you might call a low-grade triumph, the kind that tastes like tea and makes you want to walk home the long way.

By the end of the month the air began to tire of its performance and fold itself into evenings that admitted other seasons might exist. The trains grew a little melancholy, which is ridiculous, and the rooster tried out a coda I had not heard before and then got bored with it and went back to his usual. The sign at the church lost another letter and offered God I S to the boulevard and I made a secret promise to paint the missing sign someday because I want the sentence to keep being the right kind of incomplete. The river widened for no one and I kept sketching the space between ladders because it feels like the right practice. I am indebted to the middle not because it is kind but because it is honest. It keeps showing up, which is the most a person can expect from any story that intends to keep us alive. And on nights when I forget how to be impressed by the machinery I lay down, hands on ribs, and let the trains remember themselves and let the morning rehearsal begin in a box with a heart drawn low on the inside, and I wait for the bowl to arrive and I let it set itself gently on my face, and I do not call that a miracle because it is simply good engineering.
