Before dawn the hens were already awake and gossiping. The cucumber vines had grown two fists overnight, looping around the twine as if they were shy but determined, and Réka had to pry one away from the gate latch just to step into her little courtyard. She was late to everything except morning, the hour when Budapest forgot itself and wore a field’s breath. The city muffled under fog. The escarpments, panel blocks, tramlines like orange veins—out there. In here: tin bucket, the cream-steel churn, the netting that snagged on her sleeve. Bees drifted over the sunflower heads like soft punctuation.

“Stop watching me,” she told the rooster, who puffed to twice his size and blinked as if she had uttered something important in ancient Greek.

“Good morning to you, too.”

The first song came without her planning. It came as she swung the pail under the goat and pressed her forehead to the warm, faintly hay-sweat fur. A nonsense lullaby, the one her grandmother had hummed during power cuts when the candles became sugar-house windows. On the first long note even the bees seemed to lean in.

“Reeeéka!” The voice bounced along the cracked stucco wall and out toward the courtyard’s fig. “Telephone!”

She didn’t have a telephone. She had a smudged thing that took pictures and did not trust her at all. But the voice belonged to Ilka, who had a telephone. Who had three. Who would someday trade her last breath for a well-angled selfie if the bargain could be struck.

“It’s London, sweet bread. London!” Ilka had run in by the last syllable, already carrying the little phone aloft as if it were a prize fish.

The goat shifted. A creamy stream hit the pail rim, pinged, then found its center. London lived in Réka’s head as soap-slick streets, black cabs like beetles, wind in pinstripes, biscuits the size of buttons. She laughed. “They don’t call here.”

“They do now.”

Ilka’s eyes were all whites, and as Réka took the phone and pressed it against her ear the farmyard stopped being about buckets and hens. It became a stage. The fig tree an audience member with bad posture. Even the sun fussed itself into a spotlight, slanting under the eaves and finding her cheek.

“Hello?” she said into the screen, too close.

A woman’s voice, warm but practiced, as if it had been trained to lift without ever cracking. “Is that—am I speaking with Miss Réka Kalmár?”

“Yes.” She took another breath. Cucumber-green.

“This is Adele from the production team at Britain’s Got Talent. I’m calling about the final.”

The goat chose that moment to sneeze on her knee. Réka closed her eyes.

“Okay,” she said.

“There’s been a—how shall I say?—a movement. We do these wildcards occasionally, and this year we’re expanding. The video you posted with the, um, lavender in the background and the little dog?”

“Bogyó,” Réka said. “He’s not little.”

“He isn’t,” Adele said, vaguely amused. “He’s a delight. A viral delight. The producers would like to offer you a spot in the final, Miss Kalmár.”

The bucket slipped on its hook. Goat milk sloshed up her wrist. She let the cold shock anchor her. “A spot,” she repeated, as if testing a word from a foreign shelf to see whether it would break her teeth.

“You’ll be performing on the live show in London. We can help you with travel arrangements and accommodation, of course. There are rehearsals, fittings, interviews. You’ll be performing two numbers if you make it to the last cut, but for the opening we’d love you to do the Hungarian folk song. The one that made everyone cry on the internet.”

She thought of the video that Ilka had forced her to make, there in the heat, a rusting blue wash-tub behind her and her hair tied up with mismatched twine. She had sung with mud on her cheek. The dog had yodeled at the end. Somehow the world had listened. The world, or at least enough of it to be mistaken for the world if you didn’t look too closely.

“I accept,” she said, and heard the surprise in her own voice, as if the word had been waiting there for years and simply needed to be invited.

Adele laughed. “Fantastic! Fabulous. Well, I’ll send an email with details. The final is in eight days, which I know is fast.”

Eight days. The number hung in the air like a dragonfly: impossible, gossamer, buzzing.

“We’ll manage,” Réka said, and the goat scraped its hoof once in what she decided to interpret as applause.

After the call Ilka did a little dance under the fig tree and then cried into her palms. “You’re going to be on the televízió,” she said into her fingers. “And not for something bad.”

The rooster crowed, late and righteous.

“Don’t jinx it,” Réka said, though she felt ridiculous even saying the word. As if anything could jinx the way her body now hummed, the way the sky stepped closer to hear. “We’ll need to tell them.”

“Them” turned out to be the neighbors, of course, and the one who mattered: Professor Andor Barta, who lived in the lopsided villa at the end of the lane, the place with the iron balconies that leaned out as if they were trying to escape. He taught—had taught—acoustical engineering at the university until a year ago, when a small tremor in his hands finally annoyed the chalk enough to stage a mutiny. Now he was retired in theory, in practice simply changed. He measured noise in the marketplace for fun. He knew the decibel difference between one rooster and another. He drank his coffee with a metronome ticking beside it.

He loved Réka’s voice. He had discovered it in an accident, having been drawn by the sound of someone steadily singing to a broken lawnmower, coaxing it to life as if it were a stubborn child.

He had called her “my farmer nightingale” once and then apologized for the possessive.

She found him at his kitchen table, papers fanned like a white spill. His cat, Galileo, occupied a chair back with the pretense of being upholstered. The professor wore a scarf even in summer and mismatched socks in every season.

“A wild card?” he said, setting down his coffee with a deliberate care that attempted to disguise how much his hands shook that morning, a bad one then. “They have finally learned probability.”

“They’ve learned good taste,” Ilka said, installing herself at the professor’s sink as if it had been invented for her to lean against.

He beamed. It was like watching a clock-face discover sunlight. “You’ll need a piece that starts fragile and ends with architecture. Something that lets the judges think they understand you, then takes away their chairs.”

“I was thinking of ‘Tavaszi szél’ for the opening,” Réka said. “And then on the second—if I even have a second—something old made new. But I don’t know yet.”

“We will know together,” he said, in the plural of conspirators and uncles. “Eight days is troublesome. But I have done more with less. Once I had to design an entire auditorium in a hotel lobby between coffee and dessert.”

“It was a school assembly,” Ilka said, but her grin undercut the scolding.

They plotted then in soot-and-sunshine numbers. The professor scribbled ideas in a notebook whose first page he had torn out because it had annoyed him, nothing should begin at one. He spoke of tone color as if it were a dye she could stir into water. He made her sing vowels alone, measured the way her jaw wanted to close around fear. She opened it. The day warmed. A bicyclist rang a bell somewhere as if impatient at the notion of standing still.

“What about travel?” Ilka said at last, which was her gift, the fact of the world wedged into art. “Adele will want to book you a flight.”

Réka frowned. She had not been on a plane. She pictured her voice in a suitcase shaking loose on the belt and going round and round while strangers pointed. The thought of handing herself over to process. Queues. Plastic bins with barefoot humiliation. Her song dehydrated in a cabin that smelled like lemon and stale blankets.

“I want to take the car,” she said.

The professor leaned back, both amused and alarmed. “The green one?”

“It’s blue.”

“It was blue,” he said. “In 2003.”

“It runs,” she said, which was true. Mostly. Enough. It coughed sometimes in the way of old men under bridges. It liked flat roads. It hated heat.

He clicked his tongue. “I am not a friend to panic, but even I feel the hair on my arms discuss the implications. It’s 1,700 kilometers to London. Then the ferry. Then traffic in a city that chooses anarchy at intersections.”

“Yes,” she said. Her heart had already decided it, and once it did, her body was a machine. “I need to move through it, not be carried. I want the land under me. That sound I make—it comes from something older. Planes make me think of plastic forks.”

“I respect plastic forks,” he said. “They are brave in terrible conditions.”

Ilka had her palm over her mouth. She could see it all, and just as easily. The road threaded like a ribbon through her eyes. She was already negotiating snacks. “I suppose you’ll need someone to drive when you cry.”

“I don’t cry,” Réka said.

“Everyone cries,” the professor said. He had cried at snow once, he had told her, the first winter after his wife had left. Not died—left. He had admired the honesty in that verb.

They decided to go together. The professor would be her coach, driver, translator of minutiae, the one who stood just offstage and breathed with her. He had never been to London. He had always meant to go and had never gone, because life kept offering him enough. A scholarship in Vienna. A job in Berlin. A wife who liked mornings and spoke terrible French. A rooftop in Budapest overlooking chimneys that puffed like old men pretending to be dragons.

The car was blessed that evening with new oil, the kind that smells like pencils. The professor crouched on the other side of it and patted the wheel arch as if it were an anxious animal. Ilka stuffed a bag with poppyseed rolls and paprika crisps and more poppyseed rolls. Bogyó, the dog, watched the procession with the dignified skepticism of a magistrate. He would be staying behind with Ilka’s mother, who made him swear to be noble and sent him to his own bed when he failed.

When Réka finally lay down in the cupboard-sized room she kept on the second floor, the ceiling swam slightly. Her body, still humming. She thought of Adele saying “the final” as if it were a church with an echo, big and bright. Her grandmother had wanted better clothes for her than good soil. She had wanted her to work indoors. She had died with a handkerchief over her chest and a prayer half-remembered, and the last thing she had said was “Sing it out so the saints hear it.”

“It” did not need an object. It could be anything, and that was both the terror and the trick.

They left at dawn two days later. The city was all exhale. They crossed the Danube while the river was wearing fog like a scarf. The professor saluted the Parliament building with two fingers. He did that for most things. They stopped at the petrol station by Győr because he liked the way the coffee there tasted of cardboard and burnt sugar and because he had once met a mathematician at a table outside who had explained to him why certain bridges always made couples fight.

“Resonance,” he said now, stirring his tiny cup with a plastic stick. “We bring our own frequencies into everything. We stand on structures and we shake them.”

“I don’t want to shake anything,” she said, then corrected herself. “Just the right things.”

“You will.”

They spoke in little pieces on the motorway, and also in silences that grew back after each sentence like moss. The Slovakian border slid by. Austria opened as if someone had ironed it. Fields there were not fields so much as decisions. Hay bales lined up with military ambition. Here and there the hint of an orchard loose with perfume. They ate poppyseed rolls and a handful of cherries they had forgotten in the fridge. The car hiccuped when they climbed a hill outside Linz, then decided to behave. Big trucks owned the lane to their left; some of them carried cars wrapped in plastic, like loaves.

The professor had a way of listening that made her drive better. Once, when the radio lost signal and returned in tatters, he leaned forward with his ear to the air as if searching for a secret message. “That kind of artifact makes musicians. Or lunatics,” he said, and smiled that little old-man smile that frightened no one.

They slept that night in a small pension that smelled of lemon and old carpeting. The owner had ears like conch shells and a voice that persevered like a hymn. She insisted on showing them the winter garden, which in summer was simply an overheated glass room full of plants that were relieved when you left.

“I dreamt in English,” Réka told the professor the next morning, stirring a spoonful of apricot jam into her yogurt until it looked like a sunset drowning.

“What did you say?”

“I said ‘Oh’ a lot.”

“Reasonable,” he said. “We will learn more syllables for London.”

The car, perhaps jealous or tired, began to protest in small ways as they entered Germany. It did not like headquarters. It preferred bypass roads and village garages where the mechanic kept apples on his desk. But the motorway asked little of it besides speed, relentless and ordinary, and around Regensburg the engine’s hum became a question.

“Do you hear it?” she said.

“I hear everything,” he said gently. “But I am not yet worried. Not properly.”

An hour later worry took its seat. A light blinked in the dashboard, a tiny orange mouth surprised at itself.

“Oil,” she said.

“Orange is backhanded,” he said. “It pretends to be gentle.”

They pulled into a rest area shaped like an apology. There was a vending machine that promised pasta and delivered disappointment. The professor crouched, then pulled the hood up with the kind of reverence one reserves for angels or old books. Steam rose like a scold.

“We can fix it,” he said to the engine. “Of course we can fix it. Everything is fixable until it isn’t.”

He fingered the fan belt. He fished the rag from his pocket and touched it to the oil cap, sniffed, frowned. “It’s running too hot. We should let it rest. We should find a place where someone loves this sort of problem. There are men in garages for whom this is romance.”

“We don’t have time,” she said, and tasted how sharp the word time can be when bitten.

He looked at her and took his hands off the car as if it had suddenly turned into a body. “We do only if we make it. Let me call.”

They found a number on a sticker that hung on like an old promise. A man arrived in orange. He did not love this sort of problem, but he didn’t hate it either. He peered. He patted. He told them the thing everyone tells you when you are on a journey and something breaks: It is not the worst thing he has seen.

“But we have to be in London tomorrow,” Réka said, and heard the pleading there, a note she saved only for dogs and gods.

He shrugged in a way that was not unkind. “You go to Stuttgart,” he said, “there my cousin maybe can change the pump. With luck.”

They drove to Stuttgart. The light blinked again, went solid, blinked. The professor told her stories, anything to keep the beast in the dashboard from becoming the only thing in the car. He told her about the first concert hall he ever cried in, a place in Bucharest where the ceiling looked like a sunflower. He told her about the woman who had left and how she had stood on the platform and waved still as if the train might nod and reverse.

“She asked me, will you forgive me, and I said, forgive you for what? She said, for needing something else. And I said, that is not a crime. That is geography.”

“And yet you cried,” she said.

“I cry for geometry,” he said. “And when people are honest.”

The garage in Stuttgart had white tiles that made it look like a kitchen that had forgotten how to feed people. The cousin looked at the engine and spoke to it in terms that suggested a long history of betrayal. He pointed at a corner, made a sound that attempted to be a syllable, then told them to come back in an hour and a half.

“We will make it,” the professor said. He said it like a scientist discovering a law. He said it even as he knew that someone else in a better universe, a luckier one, was also saying it at the same time.

They walked to a park where swans pretended to be aristocrats. Réka sat on a bench and sang an A into the breeze and watched it slide down into water. The professor, who had brought his notebook even there, drew a circle and another circle and intersected them. He liked to remind himself that songs are only one of the ways to count.

When they returned the cousin nodded as if the universe had behaved for once. The light in the dashboard gave up its orange mutter. The car sighed with new confidence. They drove and drove. The sky went the kind of blue that reminds you of childhood pencil cases. The professor slept with his mouth open and dreamed loudly. She did not tell him.

At a station near Saarbrücken they bought a map for no reason except that the professor distrusted phones when he was tired. He said paper kept the road quiet in a way screens did not. They traced the route to Calais with their fingers, each town an unfamiliar friend. They ate crisps that tasted of vinegar and anger. She imagined the white cliffs before she could see them and felt surprisingly nothing—no panic, no exaltation. Just a long thread in her body that hummed and hummed. Final. Final. You. Sing it out, the saints.

Then near Metz the car made a new sound. Not the small cough. Not the ask. A clatter that climbed out of polite company and banged a pot.

She eased to the shoulder and turned the key. The engine stopped reluctantly. The silence that followed had edges.

“This is different,” she said.

“Yes,” the professor said. His voice had changed, its scaffolding suddenly showing. “Do not turn it on again.”

He opened the hood and immediately did nothing. He simply stood, hands on the lip of the car’s mouth, and let his head bow over it the way a man might stand at the railing of a bridge and look into the river while he decided whether the bank on the other side was worth the effort.

“What do we do?” She felt funny calm. The sort of calm that has been mistaken for courage in every story ever told by someone who lived long enough to tell it.

“We call,” he said. “Again.”

The next man in the next orange truck was different. He had a face like a closed door. He tapped at the thing he called the heart. He spoke slowly, as if that would soothe them. He told them that the car needed a part that he did not have because the world had improved since this model, that nobody stocked it because nobody believed in it. He could order it, of course. Tomorrow. The day after. Sometime.

“We have to catch the ferry,” Réka said. Her voice was too big in the little lay-by. “We have to be in London by nine a.m. tomorrow.”

“I cannot help you,” he said. He did not sound sorry. He did not sound anything.

“Train,” the professor said suddenly. He clutched at the word as if it had been misfiled. “We leave the car. We take a train to Paris, then the Eurostar. Taxis like knives. We move.”

The man in orange frowned at the economics, shook his head at the logistics. He knew how much taxis cost. He knew how much hope cost. He gave them a number for a tow. He left.

The professor began to talk fast. It looked ridiculous on him. He was made for slow and thoughtful. It made Réka want to apologize for something.

“We take only one bag,” he said. “The rest, Ilka will rescue. We keep your costume, the shoes. The binder with the sheet music, even though you don’t need it. We go now. We run. Yes? We run.”

They ran. They were comical. They looked like a television satire of people who run when they have no idea where they are going. The countryside watched them with cows. The station at Metz was a promise barely remembered. They boarded a train with their insults still damp. The professor, the lover of schedules and beautiful clocks, bought tickets in the wrong order and then bought them again. Paris threw itself at them like a bouquet and then, in exactly the same gesture, became impossible.

The woman at the counter for the Eurostar looked like a saint who had long ago found peace and was now bored by it. “Full,” she said. “Full and then full again. A strike yesterday created a backlog. I can get you on one tonight. Maybe. You will reach London after midnight.”

“Tomorrow morning rehearsals,” Réka said, and then inhaled because she already knew what she had done to the grammar of hope.

“If you do not check in by eight,” the email had said, the one she had finally opened with fingers like a thief’s. “If you do not attend the safety briefing. If you do not complete your interview. If you do not attend your mic check.” The words piled with the precision of levees. They kept water at bay as long as water agreed to be reasonable.

“We can try,” the professor said.

They tried. London became a distant planet on the other side of an oxygen line. The train they managed to get onto finally stuttered out of Paris with delightful tardiness. In the carriage a child sang a song about a cat that had lost its shoes. The cat found them again but they did not fit. People have always told those stories. We spend our lives trying to be the right size for shoes.

At Calais they were told the tunnel was functioning at the level of a tired violin, all the strings there but flinching. The departure clocks had numbers that made no sense. The toilet in the station had a line like a pilgrimage. The professor made a call he did not want to make. He spoke to Adele, but he spoke like a man who had to explain a disaster in a laboratory, where nobody was dead but the experiment had exploded anyway and some interns had eyebrows missing.

“We will make it,” he said, and Adele, whose job it was to not believe anyone until they did, said yes, yes, tell me when you have arrived, tell me what time you can be at the stage door, tell me anything that is real.

The train did not move. The train watched its own reflection in a window and considered the passage of minutes. Réka went to the bathroom and only when she saw her face in the mirror, the strange color it had acquired, did she realize how close she was to breaking. She leaned her forehead against the cool of the glass and sang one note. It fluttered uselessly along the tile. She wanted to hold an instrument and there was none. She wanted her goat. She wanted the cucumber vines to grab her ankle and pull her back like that.

When the train did move the whole carriage applauded and then pretended not to have. They reached the other side with night like a bruise. London had to be there because maps were not fiction, but for the first time in this adventure she entertained the possibility that maps lied.

At some hour she could no longer name, the phone on which their deadlines were pinned buzzed. Adele again. The voice was now a different color.

“We have to make a decision,” she said.

“We are on our way,” the professor said. “We are in Kent.”

“By the time you arrive the live show will be underway,” Adele said. “The contracts say—we must be fair to all contestants—”

“Of course,” he said. He was looking at Réka, who was looking at the floor. “But—”

“There will be other things,” Adele said, and for a second her job fell away and she became a person. “There are the results shows. There are the after parts. There is next year.”

“Next year,” he said.

“We can’t hold the slot,” she said. “I’m so sorry. You have no idea—I was rooting for you. Your video made my mum cry on a bus. That never happens. She thinks buses deserve only disdain.”

“I understand,” he said. Lies, awkward and small.

They missed it. They missed it so simply it was like the lifting of a hand. The thing that had become inevitable in her body dropped at the side of the road like a scarf someone lost. She did not cry then, either. She expected to. She made a sound, but it didn’t belong to tears. It was something that belonged to throat, a clearing that got stuck.

The professor sat beside her on a plastic bench in a station that smelled of old bread. He did not touch her. He had once told her that grief, too, has acoustics and that one must be mindful not to echo the wrong things. He placed his notebook on his lap, open to the circles.

“I did this,” she said at last. Her Hungarian felt too soft for it. “If we had flown—”

“We chose,” he said. “We chose the road. We did not choose the pump. We did not choose strikes.”

“It doesn’t matter,” she said. “The result is the same.”

“I have spent a life believing the path matters as much as the result,” he said, and then he did something she had never seen him do in public. He put his hands over his face and made a sound like a piano falling down a very long stairwell.

She stared at him because the world had moved again and she had missed that, too. When he finally lowered his hands his eyes had washed themselves raw. He was trying to compose his face and failing.

“Perhaps it is time,” he said, a sentence that did not want to be said in that voice. “Perhaps I. I am tired of measuring the air and trying to tune what will not be tuned. Perhaps I should not try at anything ever again.”

She nearly laughed because of the absurdity and then did not laugh because there was nothing absurd about it. He had said it like a decision, like putting a book back on a shelf and turning off the light. He had said it to spare her the blame. He had said it because his own map had lied to him, because he had believed himself to be useful and now he had a lap full of circles and nowhere to put them. The word “professor” always sounded like granite and chalk to her, something that didn't bend. Hearing it separate in the air made parts of the station wobble that were not attached to anything visible.

“No,” she said, eventually. The word came out wrong, an owl in daylight. “No.”

“It is possible,” he said. “That the most honest thing I can do is stop.”

“We will stop tonight,” she said. “We will stop for the night. We will eat something that is not a crispy nothing. And then in the morning we will go to London because even a ghost deserves to be acknowledged in the room where it ought to have walked. And then, if you wish to stop trying, you can hand in your resignation to the sky. But not here. Not because of this.”

He looked at her—and in that looking she saw herself the way he saw her: wheat and stone, voltage, stubborn fabric—and he shook his head once as if trying to detach a thought that stuck.

“You sing anyway,” he said.

“I’ll sing anyway,” she said.

They rode the last miles into London as the city’s veins woke. Bridges slid under them like whales. The dawn was the same color everywhere but wore a different accent. At the stage door of the theater the security guard with the grey beard said their names into a little microphone clipped to his shirt and then he moved his head from side to side the way a man does when he is both alive and someone’s employee.

“You were expected,” he said, without accusation.

“May we go in?” the professor said, and his voice had become very careful with itself, as if it might spill.

“For a moment,” the man said. “There’s nobody to show you, really. But you can see the hall.”

They walked into a room that had been designed to make humans feel important and small at precisely the same time. The seats folded themselves into rows like polite red mice. The stage had that smell of dust and electricity that all stages have, the smell of the previous night still in it, something sweaty and triumphant and unembarrassed.

“Stand there,” the professor said, pointing to the black tape mark near center, reflexive. “Now turn. Face the ocean.”

She did. She let the room find her. She felt her feet consider the work, the microphone stand a slender friend without memory.

She sang three notes. No more. She pitched them so they did not require a microphone, let the room welcome them and then fold them away. He did not cry. He smiled that small private smile that made his face temporarily young, the one that meant yes, this is what things are for.

When they left the theater Adele finally found them in an alley behind the stage door with a paper cup of coffee that had gone cold and a heart that had been angry at the universe for an hour and now only had room left for apology. She was small and had a laugh that kept breaking at the end as if it ought to have been a sob. She hugged Réka and left a powdery cloud on her cheek. She told her things that were meant to be filling. She was kind. It helped and did not help, exactly the way kindness does in moments where there is no plug for the leak.

“We will go home,” the professor said. “We will go the way we came.”

“You can fly,” Adele said.

“We will go the way we came,” he repeated.

He sat stiffly beside her on the train east, and when he slept he did not dream loudly. He kept his vow in his pockets like someone keeps a stone to remind themselves of where they picked it up. He did not talk about acoustics. He did not hum along with the station announcements. He handed her the last poppyseed roll and did not make a joke about seeds getting in teeth.

She wanted to take the vow from him and throw it out the window and watch it tumble in the air and then be struck by a pigeon, a blessing and an insult. But vows are not so easy, and men who have built lives out of whole numbers and careful mischief do not abandon them because someone tells them to.

At the border the officer asked whether they had anything to declare and Réka thought: an absence, I have an absence to declare, and also a performance that existed in a theater where I sang three notes to twelve thousand empty chairs. She declared nothing and they were waved through. The car waited where they had left it in Metz, a small animal cured of fever but guilty for having had it.

When they were back under the same fig tree from which the first phone call had rung, Ilka ran out and threw her arms about both their necks at once and then scolded them, which is what love sometimes looks like from an angle. The rooster crowed, late, always late.

“It’s over,” Réka said.

“For now,” Ilka said. “For now is not a night that keeps its promises. For now, we put water on for tea. For now, you nap, and then you sing into the kitchen fan because the fan likes to harmonize. For now you do not become a statue.”

She lay in her narrow bed, the ceiling again close enough to tap, and her body found at last the place where tears had been waiting. They were quiet, the good kind, the ones that leave you room for breath. On the chair, the professor’s scarf sat like something that had needed a nap for years. She heard him in the courtyard advising a small boy on the proper way to skip stones—two fingers, always two, wrist not elbow—and then his voice paused and became that careful careful thing again, a man in love with the idea of stopping. She held the words he had said in the station and turned them like a stone in palm, and then she decided to plan for a world in which he had lied, because she needed such a world to exist. She fell asleep with the taste of poppyseed in her teeth and the sound of London in her throat, like a lost pigeon finding the eaves.Morning did not arrive as a clean edge but as a seep, like tea through cloth. When Réka surfaced, her ceiling had adjusted itself into a geography she could read, hairline cracks like tributaries, a small island of peeling paint near the window that had yesterday been a bird. The courtyard below argued with itself in gentle noises: the clack of Ilka’s sandals, the hose starting with a cough, the hens narrating someone else’s business. She lay still and let her throat remember its shape. For a long time London had lived in her as weather; now it felt more like a word she had picked up in a market without buying, turned over, considered, and put back on the table only to realize later it had slipped into her pocket.

When she went down the stairs the air met her with humor, apricot-seed warm and full of pollen. The goat butted her leg as if to ask whether she had become entirely city-broken in one day and needed recalibration. Bogyó was back by then, having scandalized Ilka’s mother by attempting to harmonize with the church bells, and he greeted Réka with his usual composure, which consisted of a seated pose of nobility until the exact second it was no longer required. The cucumber vines had made another courtly advance on the gate and she unhooked them gently, telling them to be bold later, when she needed a metaphor.

Professor Barta had been up since unreasonable. He sat at the metal table under the fig tree with a cup that had lost its handle and watched sunlight audition for the role of grace on his hands. He had put his scarf on the back of a chair as if to say, I am present but I refuse to be habitual. He said good morning the way mathematicians say things, like a statement whose elegance will live or die on its economy. His tremor was worse in the first hours and better after coffee, so the mug was at his lips, and his eyes were on the line where courtyard ended and sky began.

“Tea,” Ilka said, in the tone of a dictator from a kinder regime, and slapped a sprig of mint into Réka’s palm the way one might press a medal into a soldier’s hand. “And then we will discuss the problem of the century.”

“I already missed the problem of the century,” Réka said, and the sentence, even as it tried to be light, found something heavy to sit on and made a chair of it. “What more can there be.”

Ilka put her chin on her fists and squinted at the goat as if it might have an opinion worth hearing. “If the mountain won’t go to London, we will make a hill and ask London to come downhill for once in its life. We will do it here. We will do it live. We have three telephones and one long extension cord and I can borrow a ring light from my cousin unless she sold it to buy fake eyelashes, which is possible.”

“The problem of the century is luck disguised as infrastructure,” the professor murmured, but he was looking at the wall as if it might respond to sound in a way that would be, if not noble, then at least usable. “And the problem of this courtyard is reverberation times. We can do something.”

“You said you would stop,” Réka said, and the words jumped out too fast and landed badly, like a cat misjudging a shelf. She wanted to take them back and couldn’t. They lay between them on the table like cutlery at the wrong angle.

He did not flinch or scold. He looked at her, really looked, and then he nodded once to the part of the air where he had said it, as if acknowledging a debt to himself. “I will,” he said softly. “But not before breakfast. Not before giving this fig tree the concert it deserves.”

Ilka clapped her hands then because any admission can be converted to a plan if you keep the engine idling. She produced a notebook from somewhere implausible and began drawing squares in it, squares that were probably people and also probably cameras. She assigned tasks as if she had been born doing it. The twins from house number nine would wrangle the cables. Mrs. Szűcs would bake on a scale that could feed the theory of hunger. The neighbor who believed Wi-Fi was a Western spell would be instructed to stand near the gate and keep children from unspooling themselves into traffic; he would feel important and therefore peaceful.

“Stop,” the professor said mildly, no command in the word and yet so much of his old classroom in it that everyone did. “We don’t stream amateurs yelling over motorcycles and bees. We will make a room out of the sky. We will decide what the sound is allowed to be.”

“That will take three days,” Ilka said, and it sounded like defiance but it wasn’t. It was a warning that came with affection stitched into the hem. “And she needs it to be before her courage spoils.”

“Luck is disguised as infrastructure,” he repeated. “Courage is disguised as calendar.” He rose, old joints arguing with him and then obeying because they had liked better days. “Bring me blankets. Bring me every glass jar in this lane. Bring me the tin bucket and the netting and those sunflowers you said you would let die gracefully and didn’t. Bring me chairs. Bring me silence.”

They brought him everything. They brought him a roll of carpet that had been a hallway in another life, a pair of old concert posters Ilka’s cousin had ripped off the wall of a club, a section of egg cartons nobody had had the heart to throw away, a door with chipped paint and a knuckle-graze near the latch. He draped the blankets between the fig and the laundry pole so they became both wall and sail. He lined the far side with thick quilts that smelled of winter and camphor and wordless survival. He placed jars along the window ledges and began pouring water into them from a jug like a thirsting god, stopping to hum and adjust until some resonance agreed to behave. He moved the bucket three inches and then two, He adjusted for the rooster’s ambition and the neighbor’s always-wailing kitchen extractor; he tuned the courtyard the way a baker feels dough.

“Clap,” he said to Réka, and she did, and the sound returned not in chaos but in an organized willingness, a spill with intelligence. He smiled a small smile that was not the secret boyish one but something more like relief. “RT60,” he explained to the fig tree because the fig was listening with leaves. “The time it takes for sound to decay by 60 decibels. It is now soup but it will become stew. Stand exactly there. Good. Now sing an E and we will see whether the chairs accept it.”

She sang and the air near her mouth changed. It felt denser, as if someone had hung molecules like coats on pegs. The bees were punctuation again, but gentle, less punctuation than ellipses. Even the neighbor’s extractor took a breath as if to admire something. Bogyó made a low groan of approval and put his head on the professor’s shoe. The professor stroked his ear only once and then set the laptop on the upturned crate and waved Ilka toward the power strip as if he were summoning an accomplice and not simply assigning someone to not electrocute herself.

Adele called in the afternoon, and because there is only so long one can hide from a person whose job is the public choreography of other people’s dreams, they answered. She told them that she had been yelled at by four bosses and a judge who thought glitter needed to be regulated, and then told them that one of the junior editors had seen a blurry clip on social media of a woman singing three notes in an empty theatre, and that they wanted to use it if they could secure permission to feel human for once. She hinted, too carefully to be crude, at a slot on the results show for a brief remote segment if they could deliver a video that sounded good and looked like something they could broadcast without lawyers collapsing.

“We are busy rescuing a courtyard,” the professor said, and the sentence seemed to calm her, as if it explained their nature in a way that made them predictable and therefore safe. “We can send you something tonight. But you understand, we are not London.”

“You’re better,” she said, and it sounded like a real thought that had slipped out by accident. “Send me what you have. Send me a version in which she speaks in Hungarian for a few seconds and then sings, because my producer thinks language is an illness you catch if you touch it, and I like making him dizzy.”

They worked until the courtyards’ narrow slice of sky turned the gentle bruised peach that Budapest keeps for those who have spent all day doing something unreasonable and are not yet repentant. The professor’s hands shook more now and he refused to be kind to them. He steadied jars against their shiver. He wrote notes with a pencil so short it had become a metaphor. He lifted the laptop and put it down, lifted it and put it down, until the level of the tiny camera was not in moral danger. He swore at a wasp in an Alfredo pattern of swearing that managed to be elegant even as it was irritated. He arranged sunflowers in an arc that worked like an acoustic shell because somewhere long ago he had designed a stage for two trombones and compensated for the ego of brass and had never quite forgiven or forgotten.

“Don’t go for sorrow,” he said to Réka as she broke the skin of air with the first vowel. “Not yet. Begin with gratitude and let the grief leak in later, slowly, like a roof. ‘Tavaszi szél’ is correct. And then something after that—something that allows the British to pretend they discover you in the second verse.”

The choice they came to, after a stretch of silence that had almost become stubbornness, was a lullaby no one could place unless they were the sort who cried at folk songs alone in kitchens. It had no official name in her grandmother’s mouth. It was the one she had hummed when the war was a story but also a pantry, the one that could be embroidered into any night, the one with the line about the little horse that cannot find the bridge unless someone sings it true.

The first take went beautifully wrong because Bogyó decided the line about the horse was his to guard and added a coyoteish yodel just as she reached a syllable that needed to be solitary. The second take failed because the rooster discovered an opinion. The third was a study in humility because the neighbor’s extractor had a relapse. The fourth kept collapsing into laughter at nothing, because only a person made entirely of iron can focus after the world has elbowed you so insistently, and none of them believed that iron without rust is virtue.

On the fifth take, something recognized them. The light slipped under the blankets in a way that allowed her face to exist without arguing with the camera. The figs shifted and became an audience without needing a chair. The professor folded his hands the way a monk might and tilted his head because he preferred the plane of the courtyard at a slight angle, as if sound could trick gravity into a partnership. She sang. She let the gratitude go first, patience braided into the fronts of the notes. She did not think of London as she had thought of it for three months—shiny magic and administered justice—but as a place in the abdomen, a city of breath. Instead of reaching for the terrible trick at the end that made hearts fold, she folded first. She sang the lullaby and then, almost without turning the wheel, threaded into an English song she had learned from a cassette in a kitchen in 1999, something simple and honest about a river being wider than a road. The vowels softened because Hungarian had trained them well. The lyrics did not become hers, but they stopped being someone else’s. It was enough.

“Good,” the professor said when she finished, as if he were awarding a piano a degree. “Again,” he added immediately, wiping at his eyes in a way that might have been dust.

They sent Adele a version before the moths found the bulbs. They sent a file with a name that meant nothing to anyone else and everything to them. They went to sleep for an hour and woke when a motorbike in the next street started a fight with a window. They drifted about the kitchen collecting objects then putting them down in the wrong place and each time the bee that had come indoors by mistake discovered a new mirror and tried again to argue with transformation. The professor sat on the step and braced his elbows on his knees and let his head drop.

“If I send my resignation to the sky, will it answer?” he said, and it was not a request for counsel; it was the sort of thing people say when they half-want to be pushed and half-want to be allowed to sit down.

“The sky is bureaucratic,” Ilka said, because she refused to be awe-struck in the presence of melodrama, however justified. “You’ll have to fill out three forms and then someone loses them, and then in six months you receive a letter addressed to a dog that died two years ago. In the meantime, perhaps make another blanket tunnel.”

He lifted his head and exhaled a flare of laughter that frightened the moth and then coaxed it back as if laughter were safer than it looked. He did not promise anything. He stood. He adjusted a jar a thumb’s width and then declared the courtyard closed until dawn as if it were an airport he had the power to shut down. He slept in the chair with his scarf over his chest like a diploma and Galileo, who had finally decided the courtyard was worth inspecting, established himself on the professor’s belly with the seriousness of a judge.

The morning had the smell of rehearsed rain but withheld it. The message from Adele arrived before breakfast and almost before guilt. She wrote like someone who had been up all night doing a job that claimed to be about joy and was mostly about making sure people didn’t break, but who had found a corner of joy anyway and was reluctant to name it lest it run away. The network wanted to run a clip. The producer wanted Réka live, even just for ninety seconds, somewhere in that courtyard with those sunflowers, in a section of the show reserved for what they called “the world,” which typically meant children yodeling from boats and parrots doing Sinatra. It was nothing and it was everything. They would send a link, a time, a tech person called Gary who had never once been on time and who compensated by treating every second thereafter as precious metal.

“We aren’t a satellite,” the professor said to the phone in general. “We are a stubborn neighbor with a blanket.”

“Exactly,” Adele wrote back, which was both not an answer and the only answer that made any sense.

The neighborhood conspired with them the way neighborhoods sometimes do when it will cost very little money and very much attention. There are always people who have been waiting all their lives to be useful. Someone produced a cable long enough to become a myth. The twins discovered that if you set the bucket at a certain angle and tapped its rim, you could get a chime that sounded expensive. The extractor’s owner agreed to turn it off during the appointed time if somebody stood in his kitchen and held a wooden spoon over the pot like a scepter, in case flavor escaped. Even the rooster was bribed with a corner of bread and a stern look and, for once, understood when the beat was not his to occupy.

She changed into the dress Ilka had bullied her into buying months ago, cream that remembered wheat, and let her hair be her hair because there was no time to subordinate it into an idea. The professor wore a shirt he had forgotten cut in a way that made him look like a photograph in which intentions were young; he refused to remove his mismatched socks because superstition had to draw a line somewhere. Ilka applied a degree of mascara that turned her into a god of infrastructure and swore at Gary, who appeared as a disembodied voice in a device and said words like “latency” as if they were the names of his children.

At the minute of arrival everything narrowed and expanded as it always does in the good rituals. The screen showed squares of other humans in other rectangles, and then her square grew and grew and then the sound left the courtyard and went wherever it is sound goes when it leaves a place it understands. She did not give them sorrow yet. She did the thing the professor had asked, which was to begin with gratitude and let the grief leak in later like a stubborn roof that refuses to entirely fail because it has standards. She sang the first verse in Hungarian so that the people who would be annoyed could be annoyed and the people who needed the ache in the vowels could be fed, and then she gave them English in her chewy, careful way that made even the flat words round.

While she sang, the professor did not look at the screen. He watched the way the leaves moved at the edge of her voice. He watched the bees decide whether to be punctuation or adjectives. He counted in a way that had nothing to do with numbers and everything to do with time. He imagined the empty chairs in London and offered them his patience, a tithe. He thought briefly about the letter he had promised to write to the sky and felt, for the first time since the station, the unimportance of its address.

When it was over, when Gary had declared their bandwidth sufficient for the era and Adele had sent a message that was mostly emojis except for the part where she promised to call, when the neighborhood released the breath it had been holding the way people release birds at weddings and pretend the birds are not terrified, when the rooster forgot himself and declared noon at ten-thirty, they sat at the table under the fig with cracked cups and poppyseed in their teeth and silence on their shoulders like shawls. The professor looked at his hands and then at the sky and then at the hands again and finally placed them flat on the table as if to prove to someone that the tremor had boundaries and that he was still there within the shaking.

“I will write them a letter anyway,” he said, and his voice was clean of theater. “But it will not be a resignation. It will be the opposite of that. What is the opposite of a resignation.”

“A recommencement,” Ilka said promptly, because she liked to have words ready in little glass jars for moments like this. “Or a ridiculousness. I am not a dictionary. You are the professor.”

He smiled at that, the small private smile that rolled back ten, fifteen years in his face, the one that had frightened no one. “I will deliver it without stamps,” he said. “Tonight, when Galileo has decided I am furniture.”

They ate and let the day behave like a day. Drizzle tried itself and then stopped. A boy from number twelve knocked and asked whether he could borrow Bogyó to show a cousin what an intelligent dog looked like, and was told yes and then required to explain his plan to the dog, who listened gravely and then agreed. A woman brought cake with apricots arranged like planets that had not yet realized they were destined to collide. The courtyard, which had not asked to become a stage, reverted to being something else without argument: a place where mint grew and bees wrote opinions in the air and someone, sooner or later, would forget their keys and swear.

It was almost evening when Adele called, her voice bright with managerial triumph and something that sounded a little like relief, like a shoulder with a bruise on it that had decided it could be used. The clip had aired and people had written to the show to tell them they had cried and some of them had said sorry about that and others were very proud of themselves. She said that one of the judges had made a little speech about authenticity and although she would have to manage him more carefully forever now, she could not deny the math of the moment. She said that someone in an office that mattered had asked whether Réka might be willing to come in the autumn for something that was not the final and not not the final, a special that required fewer lawyers and more candles, where she could stand still and do something simple without competing with a man with a piano tied to balloons.

“We will talk tomorrow,” the professor said, because he had begun to love tomorrow again and could not bear to scare it. “We will read emails very slowly. We will decide how to arrive when invited.”

After the call, he took his notebook and, because rituals help even the rational, he tore out the first page again even though nothing had been written on it yet. He wrote a letter that was not a letter while he watched the last of the light collect itself. He did not address it to the sky. He addressed it to a particular sound he had failed to capture in a station at night and told it that he would try again, that he would keep applauding structure until it applauded back. He folded the paper not like a plane but like a boat, and then because he had no river he placed it in the tin bucket near the sunflowers and watched it sit there, reasonable and silly.

When sleep came it did not need to be begged. She lay in her narrow bed and tested the word “final” on her tongue and felt nothing break. She imagined London not as a city but as a person in a queue who had turned to let her step ahead because she was late and because sometimes we do the right thing without knowing it will change anything. She thought about her grandmother’s last instruction and the way it had made “it” irrelevant and therefore infinite. In the other room the professor snored like a ship docking and Galileo purred like an argument that had found a conclusion. Ilka’s phone vibrated itself off the table and onto the rug and then slept where it fell, humbled. The cucumbers curled in their green sleep with private ambition. The rooster had, at last, no opinion. And somewhere above the blankets that had briefly been walls, a star that had not realized it had died yet kept sending its old light back toward them with the courage of habit.The days after the broadcast learned to walk without scuffing their toes. They came with the soft-tempered insistence of a milk pan warming, filling the courtyard with small applause that had to be localized before it became ridiculous. Old women touched Réka’s elbow at the market as if it were a doorbell and said they had watched and then claimed they had not cried, and then took a breath between sentences that told on them. Teenagers in hoodies who belonged to other languages and better sneakers made a point of not looking when they walked past the gate, and then returned an hour later on imaginary errands to angle their ears at the hallway. A man who had previously objected to everything that could be objected to under EU guidelines deposited a jar of honey on the steps with a label that read simply For the Voice, as if it were an organ in a jar on a shelf. Notoriety at the scale of the lane had its own physics. It made groceries take longer. It made gossip kinder. It increased the number of cakes in circulation to a level that began to worry Ilka’s dentist.

Adele wrote with a rhythm that suggested she had found a spare hour, lost it, found it again, and tied it to a table leg. The autumn special had sprouted petals. It would not be London exactly, nor a sacrament, but it would be televised and lit and given that particular flavor of significance that cameras sprinkle like salt. Her producers liked the courtyard, which made her laugh at the perversity of commerce. The list of requirements swelled politely. There must be rights and permissions. There must be a location that could pretend to be both intimate and administratively safe. There must be assurances that no animals would do anything notably animal without a script. There must be a song that people would know but find new, and a song no one would know but feel as if they had been born in. There must also, if possible, be a scarf with a story behind it and an elderly gentleman who could be made to smile on cue, though she did not put that in writing because she liked to keep her job and the professor did not belong to anyone’s bullet points.

The professor gave himself three mornings to keep his vow folded on his tongue like a pill he might not swallow and then failed at not failing. He caught himself designing a reverberation shield for the corridor as if the corridor were a bell he had decided to line with velvet. He found a child in the lane, the sort who collects useful facts with the ferocity of a magpie and refuses to accept the word “hobby,” and taught him how to listen to the difference between a clap that lives and a clap that dies. He wrote the word recommencement at the top of a page and then, offended by its triumph, crossed it out and wrote kitchen instead, because kitchens are where most noble ideas are either fed or starved. He unrolled a carpet no one had wanted in fifteen years and explained to a goat why a fringe in the wrong direction will defeat even the most disciplined bass. He admitted, in a manner that would allow him to deny it later, that he might need to go back to the university library and borrow a book he had once tried to read all the way to death.

He took Réka to a chapel two tram stops and a century away, a small pale place that had survived wars by disguising itself as a laundromat and then as a story. The custodian had keys like a jailer and a voice that refused to admit echo was real; in his church, he said, God preferred to sit in the front pew and listen unmagnified. The professor, with that respectful bullheadedness that had charmed and irritated authorities across the late twentieth century, convinced the man to let them sing on a Tuesday when no one planned to commit a major sin. They stood in the wash of stone and wood and envelope air, and he made her find the note that the room wanted to be first, then the note it reluctantly agreed to consider after that. The pews creaked at inconvenient poetry. A sparrow got in and refused to be counselled. The custodian listened from the door with hands so firmly in his pockets that it looked as if he feared they might go somewhere and steal.

“She will sing to the walls,” the professor told him, as if he were placing an order that would be ready in twenty minutes. “We will ask the walls to be generous.”

“The walls are Calvinist,” the man said, and then, because he was alone more than a man should be, he smiled with most of his teeth.

They recorded nothing that day but breath. They mapped how the place would tolerate microphones. They left a tin of poppyseed rolls on the vestry table and departed while the custodian turned the key with his whole shoulder, like a man closing a very small, very stubborn planet.

Ilka became a manager in everything but tax status. She printed out the producers’ emails and pinned them to a cork board as if she were investigating a crime she had witnessed from across a river. She took so many calls that her phone began to assume it lived surgically under her ear. She drafted polite refusals to men in sports jackets who wanted to represent the brand in exchange for percentages that sounded thin until you did math and realized you had just agreed to hand over someone’s arm. She said no to a soft drink commercial with a sincerity that suggested she had been preparing her whole life to oppose bubbles. She said maybe to a radio appearance because the presenter had once been rude about a government minister in an elegant way and that counted for something. She said yes to the old lady from the market who wanted five minutes in her kitchen with a cassette recorder and a promise that nobody messy would come inside wearing shoes.

London receded from a dream you chase to a weather report you check. It occupied a corner of the day. It was there when the goat sneezed and when someone knocked over the jar with the perfect E in it and when Bogyó came home with the expression of a dog who had gone somewhere forbidden and been adored. It interwove with cucumbers and the fig’s heavy green insistence, with the professor’s arguments about the correct angle of chairs and the discovery that the man two doors down had once built stages in Prague with nothing but rope and promises. It did not diminish so much as get edited down into something sustainable, a line on a grocery list between mint and vinegar that Ilka underlined twice for the pleasure of the pen.

When the first brown envelope from a television station in Budapest arrived, they opened it as if it contained a baby owl. It invited her to sing on a show that prided itself on being about roots and wore folk heritage like perfume. The honor was real; the risk was also real. The program’s host spoke in the tone of a woman who has carried tired men home from wedding tents and has no tolerance left for lying or decorative piety. The professor watched a clip of last season and nodded as if finally someone had laid the cutlery in the right drawer. “She will not make you into lace,” he said, and it felt like a blessing. They said yes and then borrowed a dress from a cousin that looked like a meadow you weren’t allowed to trample and then did, because life makes you cruel to meadows and then asks for forgiveness.

On the day of the studio taping, the sky put on a very convincing autumn rehearsal and then forgot to follow through. The building looked like an office block that had taken theatre classes and passed with average marks. Inside, everything had crews and labels. A woman gently harassed the hair of several small pop stars until it looked as if it had slept in a storm and learned humility. A man with a headset directed the arrangement of vases on a table as if it were politics. The host hugged Réka as if they had agreed to be cousins in a previous life and then spent ten minutes explaining how to breathe when you come in from the wings so you do not spend the first verse apologizing to your lungs.

Backstage had the smell of coffee determined to be excellent and failing by millimeters. The professor stood with his hands folded as if he were admirable furniture. He made himself useful by insisting that the wedge monitor be either moved or blessed. He spoke with a sound engineer who had the expression of a man frequently forced to add glitter to things he liked just as they were, and it turned out they knew someone in common, and soon the conversation had left the present and involved dust and festivals and that one summer when all the in-ear monitors fought and nearly won. The recording went smoother than it deserved to. She sang as if she had a house she could take apart and grow again. In the green room afterward, someone put a glass in her hand and the room clapped correctly. It did not feel like the adjudicated ecstasy of London; it felt like a warm kitchen where jokes do not need to be explained if you are from here.

Their lives acquired a calendar that was not oppressive and not free. There were weekends when the professor took her to a library built like a train and showed her a room where a woman once smuggled books out under her coat during a purge and gave them to children as if they were carrots, and they stood there for a while and said nothing and then went for soup. There were Tuesdays when a man from a label with beautiful stationery came to the courtyard and used careful verbs to describe how he would polish her until she could see herself, and she offered him coffee that had not been polished at all and told him she would think about it and then got distracted by an argument about light and forgot to think. There were nights when she sat on the stoop and sang quietly to the starlings the way starlings sing to electricity wires, and an old man passing with a bag that clinked took off his hat for no one in particular and put it back on as if tipping it had made the path aware of his virtue.

Adele appeared in the courtyard before summer turned definitively into a new script. She arrived with a suitcase the size of loyalty and a laugh that had learned not to apologize for existing at odd times. Her hair understood humidity as a suggestion and had decided to accept or reject it as a daily sport. She had eaten things on planes she would never confess to a priest. She wore clothes that traveled well and expressions that did not. She looked around as if she had been told there would be a courtyard and was pleased to discover it joking in exactly the way promised. She brought a cameraman who had married someone measurable and was therefore kind to objects, and a sound person named Sheila who, when she saw the professor’s jars, made a sound that indicated religion.

“We’re not a truck,” Adele said, setting her suitcase under the fig with an apology for its wheels. “We brought ourselves and three cables, and we will borrow the rest from your belief.”

“You may have the belief,” the professor said. “Return it by Tuesday.”

Gary did not come, which improved matters. Sheila walked the alley clapping softly, as if testing for a stubborn ghost. She and the professor became family in under an hour. They argued in a dialect that was half science, half kitchen, the part of engineering that begins with “What if” and ends with “We will not die.” The neighbors came to the window like heads in a painting. Ilka negotiated with three babies and two elderly men whose relationship to dignity was unhelpfully strong. The cameraman set up his shot and immediately fell in love with a gutter; he said things like texture and Adele said things like insurance, and then they both said things like yes.

A complication arrived precisely when it ought to, dragged by a man in a blue jacket that communicated lightly with laws. Filming was a thing that required paper. Paper was a thing that required a fee. Fees were things that required either time or friendship, and they had neither in the quantities specified by the form. The professor went diplomatic. He made compliments that were almost compliments. He offered, in the way old men who know their city often can, to call someone who owed him kindness from 1989, and even the jacket felt that might be an event worth attending. Ilka, having been born to argue with clipboards, laid out a plan that did not involve bribery, only an exchange of muffins for mercy and a promise that no explosions would take place without first consulting the municipality. In the end, the man left with a piece of cake and a copy of the schedule written on the back of a recipe for tarhonya, and Adele texted a producer in London to tell him that she had conducted diplomacy at the level of pastry and it had worked, please update the manual.

They filmed absurdly beautiful things by accident. A bee landed on the lip of a jar filled to a height that made it sing back to the courtyard in the key of forgiveness, and the cameraman caught it, and afterward in the kitchen he showed them the clip on a loop until the bee began to seem like a rehearsed idea and they all had to take a nap to stop being silly. A neighbor opened a window at the wrong moment and their laughter became the kind that scares dogs, and then when they settled, the window’s frame caught light that had been late to a party and decided not to be sorry, and it made the alley look lit by kindness. The professor forgot to be cautious with his hands and gestured like a conductor who has just persuaded a stubborn bassoon to fall in love with a clarinet. Sheila left the blankets in place for a second shot and when someone asked, she said it wasn’t for sound; some thresholds are worth keeping for reasons numbers can’t scold.

When they needed a place that was not the courtyard but was still the courtyard’s cousin, they went to the bathhouse on the Buda side where the air makes elderly men into philosophers and young men into blasphemers. They did not film inside because permission was not so much a thing you acquired as a myth you told children, but they stood in the entryway and sang a scale to practice vowels, and the porter, who had seen everything except an honest apology from any government, nodded once and did not forbid anything that did not injure his tiles. Tourists passed and thought about their feet. Someone whistled something from a war. The professor demonstrated how steam makes sound behave like relatives at a wedding—combining, separating, reforming conspiracies—and Réka pretended this was not the loveliest metaphor he had manufactured all month and then told him it was because he deserved his rations of praise in regular doses.

In the evenings they rehearsed in smaller and smaller circles, the way you can fold paper until it begins to fight. They took apart a lullaby and spent an hour on one vowel as if it contained instructions for a life. Adele learned the shape of the courtyard’s day and knew now when not to knock. She told them stories about judges and lighting rigs and a man who had once tried to swing a piano and had nearly swung the show. She did not try to turn their story into safer television; she had already done that in other rooms. Here, she asked questions that wanted answers like bread wants soup, and when her phone vibrated with a question that had a budget attached, she looked at it as if it were a mosquito that had gotten in and would, with persistence, find the window again.

The professor took his recommencement letter to the river with less ceremony than either of the women would have chosen and more devotion than he was willing to admit. He went at noon on a Wednesday while the city was busy arguing with itself in corridors and buses. He stood on the Pest side and looked where the water pretends to be slow and is not. He did not unfold the paper because the letter had been said in the courtyard already when he moved the jar a thumb’s width and decided to work with the sky again whether it answered him or not. He folded the page into a boat and then, because he is not a man who trusts boats without ballast, he tucked a coin into it, a coin that had lived in his pocket since the time he had been on a bridge with a woman who asked for forgiveness he could not give without waking something stubborn. He set the boat on the surface and watched it go not epically but obligingly, making the small movements that prove physics is just another way of saying faith. An old woman on the bench behind him said something derogatory about ducks and then amended it to something affectionate as if the river had taught her manners in the last minute. He saluted without thinking. He saluted everything these days when memory walked past.

The evening before Adele flew back, the courtyard hosted a minor riot of contentment. The neighbors didn’t call it a party because that would have required someone to plan forks. They brought what they had in hand. Someone made a salad that tasted exactly like the afternoon it came from. Someone else made a stew that had already survived two wars and one divorce and did not consider this assembly sufficient cause to alter its personality. The professor worked the poppyseed out of his molars with a toothpick and then used the toothpick to point out a new defect in the positioning of a chair’s leg, and Ilka, meanwhile, negotiated a truce between a small boy and a pastry with the efficiency of a judge dealing with a case she had seen every week for a decade. Adele, whose job had taught her to sneak away from gratitude before it became clumsy and bit her, stayed all evening anyway and allowed the awkwardness to adore her in manageable spoons.

It had to unspool badly at least once to justify the effort, so of course Gary finally appeared by video link in the middle of the toast someone was making to the survival of cables. He wanted a new ending for the segment. He wanted a shot of the goat as a climatic punctuation because a person he was paid to make happy thought goats were the same as old violins. He wanted, very carefully, a tear on someone’s face that could be photographed without explaining context to lawyers. Ilka took the phone in a way that suggested she could turn men into pamphlets if she concentrated. She used words like process and deliverable because she understood that they were the talons beneath which Gary lived. She promised him twice as much authenticity at six the next morning if he would, until then, leave her courtyard alone. He said he would ask. She said he would tell. The call ended with the hiss of relief you hear when a gas ring catches at last.

They woke before dawn and gave Gary the ending he had asked for without admitting it to themselves. The goat did not sneeze at the right time because goats prefer tragedy without cues. The rooster had discovered an eloquence the day’s light did not require. The twins from number nine were late because they had fallen asleep on the roof and been woken by the temptation to steal their own ladder. Only the fig tree behaved as expected, offering shade exactly where shade could be understood as a short-term solution. They filmed with the light that belongs to hours when milk tastes like a plan. The camera caught Réka’s face in a way that would later cause a woman in Birmingham to pause in the middle of wiping jam from her child’s cheek and say oh without knowing what it was for. The professor, who still disliked being told to perform his feelings, let one escape while no one was looking and Gary got his tear anyway, because the world is full of victories neither side will take credit for.

Autumn began to sharpen its knives politely. A neighbor arrived with a jacket that remembered another man and asked whether the sleeves might be made to pretend. A child began school with a posture that threatened adolescence too early and then ran back in the afternoons to explain arithmetic to the dog. The email about the autumn special materialized into ticket numbers and call times and hotel confirmations that promised beds that could persuade anyone to make mistakes. They would fly, the professor decreed, because it is a vanity to worship consistency when you have learned the cost of stubbornness late at night on a bench that smelled of bread. He bought a secondhand suitcase because his old one looked like luggage for a man who had sworn never to measure again, and this new one could be wheeled with a confidence that could frown at curbs. Ilka printed boarding passes ninety minutes after a cutting remark about how late capitalism had made us complicit in our own dehumanization and then asked whether she had spelled the surname correctly.

The night before they left, the courtyard staged a performance of not quite sleep. No one was nervous, and everyone was. The cucumber vines had slowed, having understood summer’s grammar, and simply lay there like accomplished sentences. Galileo installed himself in the professor’s suitcase precisely on the shirt that least deserved to be covered in hair. Bogyó delivered a chew toy to Réka’s feet as if it were a talisman against turbulence and then, as she bent to thank him, promptly took it back because his generosity had limits and she had reached them. The professor rehearsed a series of sighs at the thought of airports and let himself be absurd about water in bottles. He talked about cabin pressure as if it were an acquaintance he disliked and would be polite to anyway at public festivals.

When dawn built itself, they set off in a taxi that pretended not to know their street and then admitted it had known it since before the new lamppost and after the last generation of stray dogs gave up on the baker. The airport was doing its impression of modernity with courage, which is to say it had lines that defied arithmetic and employees who could be kind if they were not addressed as representatives of a system. The professor forced himself to admire the efficiency of an escalator while complaining about its angle. Ilka wore a jacket that made her look like she had a press badge even when she didn’t, and the security guard gave her the look saved for people who have done nothing wrong yet and will do something interesting later. They stood on the moving walkway like lovers at a train platform and considered the art of being carried without complaint.

In the pocket of her dress, Réka had folded a small piece of paper with a list written in her grandmother’s kitchen hand. It was a list of ways to avoid being foolish around strangers and included such items as Always take your own spoon and Don’t speak on the stairs because the steps will steal your words and anything you confess to a new wall belongs to it forever. She could hear the kettle in the background of the handwriting, its way of making advice feel hydrated. She added a line in her own script—Sing it out so the saints hear it, and if there are no saints in the room, let the chairs stand in—and put the paper back and felt the weight change, as if even this tiny instruction could tilt a day.

They boarded. There is a way a plane door closes that announces bravado for everyone who lacks it. The cabin air had that lemon-stewed smell of public decisions. A man across the aisle talked softly to a toddler who had decided to count until the landing. A woman beside them took a small bottle from her bag and drew a cross in the air so efficiently that God must have appreciated the time saved. The safety demonstration happened to people who had already promised themselves never to need it. The professor, who had once loved trains because they forgive you for walking, looked very hard at the wing and decided not to despise anything that would take him where a promise had been stored.

As the plane muscled itself off the ground, Budapest became parchment under a magnifying glass and then became memory so quickly it was like an error. The river kept its swagger, even at that altitude. The stadiums and chimney stacks and peculiarities of roof learned to be abstractions and then gave up. The sun found her cheek because it had been practicing for weeks. She thought of the chapel’s sparrow and the custodian’s Calvinist walls and the way the professor had folded his recommencement and launched it with a coin. She thought of Adele making a bridge between offices where daylight has no business and the courtyard where bees and jars had invented their own bureaucracy. She held inside her one too many adjectives and told herself that once they landed she could spend them like money at a street market, on cheap necklaces and strings of dried peppers and promises from stallholders to polish anything.

Over the Channel the clouds flattened into cruelty and then found their humor again. The cabin shook once in a way that made two people fall in love and an infant realize laughter is an option. The professor reached for the armrest and then withdrew his hand because he remembered being not the sort of man who reached. Ilka cracked a sunflower seed in her teeth and collected the shell in her palm, because somewhere a grandmother had made a rule and she could not offend her memory, not even thou­sands of meters above the sea. The pilot spoke to them in a voice that had eaten too many neutral syllables and promised London in eleven minutes, which is often how many minutes there are between a doubt and the discovery that you were right to ignore it.

They landed into a morning that wore its rain like a handshake. The airport was predictably a maze that had hired someone to make signs that had learned to be optimistic and failed at the exact moment they were needed. Their passports were examined by a man who had recently found out he could like people again and was trying not to show it. The conveyor belt delivered luggage with the solemnity of an institution that knows exactly how much of your soul it can humiliate. The professor’s suitcase arrived with a cat hair attached that did not belong to any of the creatures in the building, and he acknowledged Galileo with a salute he pretended was to no one.

On the road into the city, London did not even try to be Budapest with glitter. It was its own stew. It was buses that had been red so long they’d forgotten other options. It was warehouses turned into opinions. It was the river moving as if it were late to something important and did not want to talk about it. It was the smell of curry and wet newspaper and coffee in cups that would never biodegrade in time to matter. It was a language that had been sharpened by too many knives and remained, somehow, good for butter. It was out there and then all at once it was very much in here and they were part of its lung, and somewhere in a building built for applause and taxes there was a stage marked with tape that meant something and a microphone that had been cleaned skeptically and a chair with a name on it and a man with a clipboard who would tell them, with great kindness, exactly how to get lost.Once inside the venue, they navigated corridors that seemed designed to test patience and defy geometry, with signs pointing like mischievous fingers. Réka followed Adele, who led them with an air of practiced authority, her quick steps signaling familiarity with the labyrinth. The professor walked beside Réka, his eyes roving the architecture as if he were searching for forgotten echoes in the corners of the hallways.

The backstage area was a hive, bustling with technicians, performers, and crew members, all moving with the coordinated chaos of a circus behind its curtains. Réka absorbed the energy like a plant drinking in sunlight, her nerves whispering excitement. It was a world held together by cables and camaraderie, where urgency was the language spoken fluently by everyone present.

They were shown to their dressing room, a space that bore the marks of countless performers—walls painted with layers of stories, mirrors lined with bulbs that confessed imperfections under honest light. Réka’s reflection stared back at her, both foreign and familiar, as she pinned her hair and adjusted the fall of her dress, conscious of the transformation from courtyard singer to something more publicly pronounced.

A knock at the door pulled her from her contemplation, and Ilka stepped in, carrying a small bouquet she’d received from a well-wisher at the airport. The flowers were simple, not extravagant—a nod from a stranger who somehow understood the depth of Réka’s journey. Ilka placed them on the table, arranging them with the care one might reserve for a centerpiece at a family gathering, and stepped back, folding her arms with satisfaction.

“Break a leg,” Ilka said, her voice full of mischief and promise, echoing the confidence she had always worn like armor.

The professor remained a steady presence, offering advice at intervals, his reverence for acoustics manifesting in small adjustments he suggested with the patience of a craftsman who knew the heart of his material. He pointed out potential pitfalls to avoid on stage: the trick of stepping slightly back from the mic, the reminder to ride the wave of her own voice and let it carry her.

“The room will understand you if you let it,” he told her, half-chiding and wholly supportive. Réka nodded, absorbing his words as guidance rather than instruction.

Rehearsals came in bursts, a series of starts and stops as the technical team fine-tuned their equipment, adjusting for sound, for lights, for the inevitable unpredictability of live performance. The stage became a symphony of preparation, each participant playing their part in an elaborate overture to the main event. Réka took her place, stood at the center where floors met the feet of an imagined audience, and let her voice stretch into the space, feeling it ripple back like a tide finding home.

The hours before the performance slipped through their fingers like sand, grounding them but also propelling them forward with unseen momentum. Adele juggled her responsibilities, her phone a constant companion, her demeanor a blend of courtesy and command. She checked in on Réka frequently, each visit a reminder of the support beneath the glamour, the friendship within the undertaking.

As the time drew near, Réka found herself at the edge of anticipation, the still moment before a plunge. The anxiety of performance was present, tangible like a weight resting on her shoulders, yet it was also a familiar ally, one that sharpened her focus and honed her intent. The dressing room noise hushed to a low resonance, like a room holding its breath, waiting for the signal to exhale.

When she was finally called to the stage, the world narrowed to the immediate, to the path from the wings to the spotlight. The professor offered her a final reassuring smile, Ilka a fleeting touch on the arm—a silent blessing. Then the cityscape beyond these walls fell away, leaving only the artistry, the promise, the singular act of stepping into song.As she stepped onto the stage, Réka's world contracted into the circumference of the spotlight. The audience was a distant sea of shadows, their faces indistinguishable, their presence grounding her yet also amplifying the singularity of her task. She felt the heft of the microphone in her hand, its cool familiarity a tether to the real amidst the surreal nature of the moment. The stage lights were anything but gentle, yet their brilliance was a comfort, casting clarity where ambiguity might have lingered.

The hush that fell over the venue was a physical thing, as if the very air stilled in anticipation. It was her opening, her invitation to lay bare what she had carried from the cobblestones of her courtyard to this cultivated arena. She took a breath, the kind that fills not just the lungs but the space around the heart, and let the music within her rise.

Her voice unfurled into the room with a confidence borne not just of practice but of presence. She sang the familiar folk song that had become a part of her identity, threading her own stories through the words. Each note was a step away from uncertainty, a reassurance echoing through the architecture of the hall and into the soul of her audience.

The song moved through its phases like a river navigating bends, its flow constant and true. Réka's voice captured the richness of her heritage, the weight of its history, transforming it into something vibrant and new yet grounding. The room listened with rapt attention, following her through every crescendo and pause, every delicate transition from power to vulnerability.

Her final notes lingered, held aloft like the last leaves on a wind that had not yet settled. The echoes were gentle, embracing, the applause more than a response—it was a recognition, an acknowledgment of the beauty crafted out of both effort and ease. Réka let the moment stretch, absorbing its warmth, its validation, before nodding her thanks and allowing the praise to wash over her, a tide meeting the shore.

As she exited the stage, the professor and Ilka met her with expressions of pride too vast for words. Their eyes spoke though, speaking of futures crafted in the attentive silence of now. Adele was behind them, her smile broad and unwavering, her presence grounding, as always, weaving the strands of their endeavor into a tapestry of accomplishment.

Réka felt the pulse of the performance still within her, a hum that matched the rhythm of life itself, asserting that what she had shared wasn't just a song, but a piece of herself given freely, and extraordinarily received.Réka stepped off the stage, her heart still beating in time with the applause that had filled the room like rain on a thirsty field. The warmth of the reception lingered in the corners of her mind, a gentle reminder of the journey she had taken to get here. She hesitated for a moment, just past the curtain, allowing herself a rare indulgence in the satisfaction of having given her best. From behind her, Ilka and the professor emerged, their expressions mirrored in joy and relief, settling around them like a shared cloak.

Ilka's eyes were alight with mischief, as if she had been the mastermind of a grand heist that had paid off beyond their wildest dreams. "You were glorious," she whispered, pulling Réka into a fierce hug, as though to ensure that the warmth of success would travel all the way back to Budapest with them.

The professor, less demonstrative yet equally moved, nodded with a gravitas that belied the emotion in his gaze. "The room, it listened like a disciple," he said, his voice carrying the weight of countless lessons distilled into this singular moment. His hands, usually animated with the tremor of accumulated energy, were now still, resting on her shoulders as if pouring strength back into her.

Adele appeared at their side, her presence as calming and steady as it had been from the start. Her grin was wide and infectious, a testament to the deep belief she'd held in Réka's ability from the very beginning. "That was magic. Pure magic," she declared, as if trying to imprint the sentiment on the air around them. "We captured lightning in a bottle tonight, and you were at the heart of the storm."

The backstage environment was a blend of residual excitement and the chaos of preparations for whatever came next. Crew members moved with the efficiency of those accustomed to being hidden gears in a much larger machine, while performers lingered in pockets of camaraderie, their adrenaline gradually waning. Here, amid the clutter and noise, Réka felt the first inklings of transformation—how this evening might mark the transition from what had been a whisper of possibility to the clearer call of destiny.

The internal hum of the evening began to settle as the professor guided them towards the quiet of their dressing room, a space now infused with the scent and sound of recent memories. There, in the calm, they took the time to reflect, to extract the larger meaning from the experience crystallized by the glare of the stage lights.

"What's next?" Réka asked, voicing the question that hovered in the peripheries of their thoughts, waiting for shape and substance.

Ilka laughed, tossing her head back with ease, already engaging with the infinite potential of tomorrow. "Anything we want," she proposed, her words buoyant with promise. "We have talent, we have the stories, and now the world is a little more willing to listen."

The journey back to Budapest awaited them, but they were not quite ready to step away from this moment. Instead, they lingered, absorbing all that had unfolded within the walls of this hall. They understood at that moment that music, like life, was as much about the pauses before the next notes as it was about the notes themselves. And in those pauses—in those breaths taken between starting and stopping, between purpose and execution—there was a future yet to be written, a sonata waiting for its melody.As Réka sat in the dressing room, still absorbing the evening's triumph, a quiet settling wrapped around her, a precursor to the thoughts that would come in the quiet of the night. The realization that she had carried her melody from the intimate confines of her courtyard into the vastness of London swelled within her, but alongside it came the realization of what lay beyond—the uncharted waters of possibility that stretch further than any horizon she had ever known.

Ilka, already planning the next steps before the current ones had cooled, talked animatedly about potential meetings, engagements, and the threads of connection that had been woven this evening. Everything felt as tangible as the bouquet on the table, as real as the echo of an audience's applause still resonating in the walls. The professor, listening with the measured patience of someone who had seen many such beginnings, suggested calmly, "Each opportunity leaves a seed, and with care, such seeds tend gardens of their own."

A tap on the door interrupted their private musings, a member of the crew popping his head in to notify them of a gathering in the green room, an informal wrap-up of the evening. With nods of agreement, they followed him down the corridor, Ilka as ever slightly ahead, leading them into the throng with her inimitable blend of enthusiasm and charm.

The green room buzzed with the satisfaction of tasks well-met, a celebratory hum of camaraderie as performers and crew alike commemorated the success of the night in shared anecdotes and laughter. Tables were arrayed with an assortment of food and drink, modest in their offerings yet generous in spirit. A convivial warmth permeated the space, as undeniable as the heat of stage lights, and Réka found herself drawn into a conversation with a performer whose set had followed hers—an exchange filled with mutual admiration and the mutual recognition of being co-conspirators in the art of storytelling.

Adele worked her way through the room, a lighthouse guiding the rhythm of festivities, ensuring that no one felt left adrift. When she reached Réka, her eyes brightening with genuine pride, she raised her glass, signaling a toast. "To music and moments like this," she proposed, "that remind us we've grown roots deep enough to hold us, no matter how far we wander."

Glasses clinked together in agreement, a clear note that underscored every whispered hope and shared ambition. Réka felt herself buoyed by the connection, by the realization that though she had stood alone on stage, the journey was inhabited by many, woven together by dreamers who chased melodies across continents.

Later, as the crowd thinned and conversations wound down, Réka and her companions slipped away, leaving behind the remnants of celebration still pulsing behind closed doors. The night's air was cool and welcoming, and as they walked back to their hotel, arm in arm, a comfortable silence enveloped them, punctuated only by the distant sounds of the city settling into the early hours.

Upon entering her room, Réka carefully placed the bouquet in water and sat by the window, allowing herself a final moment to look out over the sleeping expanse of London. In the dim light, the city appeared vast and timeless, its myriad stories intertwining with her own, stretching out in all directions. It was then that she understood—tonight was not an end, but another beginning, a continuation of a melody that would sustain her long after the applause had faded.

With a deep breath and a light heart, Réka turned away from the window. She already knew the road that awaited her tomorrow—a return journey to familiar cobblestones and greeting the morning sky from beneath the fig tree's leaves. Yet now, she possessed a newfound recognition of the space her voice could occupy, the lives it could touch, and with it, the quiet assurance of belonging.Réka awoke the next morning to the gentle cadence of rain tapping against the window, a soothing cadence that harmonized with the lingering echoes of the previous night's applause. The London sky was overcast, but rather than dampening her spirits, the weather seemed to wrap her in a cocoon of serenity, a reminder of Budapest's own unpredictable climate. Ilka was already up, moving quietly about the room, gathering their things with the efficient grace of someone accustomed to transitions. She hummed softly under her breath, a melodious thread of continuity that pulled Réka from dream to waking with comfort.

The journey home loomed ahead of them, a return to the courtyard where it all began. It was a bittersweet prospect—leaving the exhilarating tapestry of London behind, yet knowing the threads of their experience would be woven into new patterns once they returned. The possibility of what had been set into motion during this trip filled the air, an unspoken promise that their paths had broadened, enriched by the connections forged in the lime-lit moments on stage.

The professor, ever the pillar of quiet fortitude, stood by the window in their small hotel room, eyes tracing the rain’s path down the glass as if seeing beyond it into the possibilities promised by dawn. He turned, and his look of thoughtful contemplation softened as Réka and Ilka joined him, the trio united in their shared endeavor. His nod was subtle yet profound, conveying the sentiment that words might fail to capture—satisfaction, pride, and an invitation to carry forward the strengths discovered here.

Their departure from the hotel was marked by an air of nostalgia, the kind felt at the end of a play—every moment layered with significance. The staff waved them off with polite smiles, tacitly acknowledging the transformative nature of stays that had meant more than their transient formality usually allowed. The taxi ride was smooth, cruising through streets that seemed almost newly familiar, each landmark a touchstone to the memories recently made. As the vehicle wound its way toward the airport, the city receded with grace, slowly bidding them goodbye through raindrops that whispered farewell against the windshield.

The airport hummed with its own rhythm, a place simultaneously of beginnings and endings, and within its walls, they found themselves once more in the dance of completing a journey. Silent gestures and knowing glances replaced conversation while they navigated through check-ins and security lines, each one lost in their thoughts, yet comforted by each other’s presence.

The flight home was less a departure than a continuation of what had begun long before they set foot on British soil. Réka leaned her head back against the seat, eyes closed, not to shut out the world but to allow it to merge with her own expanding horizons. She carried within her the sound of clinking glasses, the weight of aspirations and well-wishes that buoyed her from strangers-turned-allies and allies-turned-friends. It was a collage of sensations interwoven with the melody of her own heartbeat, resonating through the journey with a newfound purpose.

The turbulence that occasionally jostled the cabin felt almost reassuring, as if the air had its own gentle way of reminding them that movement itself was a continuous state of being. Réka imagined the quartet of them—herself, Ilka, the professor, and Adele—like musical notes in a symphony not yet written, each playing an indispensable role in the larger composition of their shared narrative. She felt immense gratitude for these people who walked alongside her, whose paths had intertwined so serendipitously with her own.

Landing in Budapest was like a deep breath out, the plane descending toward familiar earth, their return accompanied by a sweeping view of the city cradled beneath its variegated sky. Disembarking was a fluid process, the steps purposeful and known. And stepping out into the airport terminal was akin to stepping through a mirror's reflection, returning to the cradle of familiarity but with eyes that had seen beyond its edges.

Ilka was first to comment on the absence of rain here in Budapest, her tone light and teasing as she characterized it as a reversal of expectation. There was a buoyancy surrounding them crossing back over the threshold into their city—a readiness to resume their lives while bearing the transformative pressures of their time away.

As the cab carried them back toward the comforts of the courtyard, Réka rested her head against the window and let the moving landscape fold over her, a panorama of something both intensely real and wonderfully transformative. She felt the threads of all those who had believed in her weaving into the fabric of her existence, anchoring her to a sense of place and purpose, in time with the gentle rhythms of home yet speaking a language wholly new.As they arrived at the familiar lane leading to the courtyard, the sun peeked from behind a reluctant cloud, casting a golden glow over the cobblestones as if welcoming them home. The sight of the fig tree and the twining cucumber vines was like stepping back into a favorite storybook, its pages comforting in their predictability yet now illuminated with the hints of new chapters.

Bogyó, with his sharp eyes and dignified gait, greeted them at the gate, his tail wagging a slow, rhythmic beat as if to say, "Well done, but there's more yet to do." Réka crouched down to his level, allowing him to soak her in, memorizing her once again as if he'd glimpsed some transformation in her absence.

The courtyard breathed with the life they had left behind and returned to claim—its scent a mosaic of soil, memories, and bees carrying pollen like punctuation in their humble flight. It whispered stories in the rustle of leaves, quiet revelations in the gnarled stretch of branches reaching skyward. Here, the roots of home grounded their experiences, promising to nurture whatever seeds were yet to sprout from their journey.

Ilka, her energy undiminished by travel, disappeared into the house, reappearing moments later with a triumphant grin and three steaming mugs in her hands. "Welcome back to reality—or maybe a better version of it," she proclaimed, handing out the drinks, her smile a buoyant sunbeam that steered away any remnants of fatigue.

The professor settled into a seat under the fig tree, his twinkling eyes surveying the courtyard as if seeing new potential in every corner—a conductor envisioning a symphony where everyone else saw breakfast and laundry. His hands, despite the tremors that daybreak could not hide, moved with deliberate grace, a painter happy to have a blank canvas returned to him.

"We've brought back a piece of London with us," he observed, "but also left some of ourselves behind. Such is the way of travelers and troubadours, is it not?"

Réka nodded, absorbing the words, feeling their truth settle into her very bones. The weight of what they had achieved was still sinking in, slowly transforming into a steady foundation upon which more dreams could be built. Yes, London had left its mark, but it was what they had given that gave her the greatest sense of fulfillment—the knowledge that her song had touched others, carving ripples in previously uncharted waters.

"We've always said the courtyard was our universe in miniature," Ilka mused aloud, sipping her coffee with a satisfied sigh. "And now, the universe seems to be getting bigger—or maybe we are."

Réka gazed upwards, watching as a gust of wind nudged the fig tree's leaves into a gentle dance, the sun casting playful shadows on the ground below. The world outside had indeed expanded for her, revealing connections vast and unexpected, but the courtyard remained an anchor—a touchstone she could return to, made more precious by her ventures beyond its walls.

As they sat there, hands wrapped around warming mugs, conversation drifted naturally from shared reminiscences to aspirations not yet tentatively voiced. The interplay of their words sketched a tapestry woven with the notion of continued exploration—of both the world outside and the infinite spaces within. Shadows shifted as the sun arced across the sky, casting new patterns with each passing hour, but within Réka, the resolve to embrace the changing contours of possibility grew ever stronger.

The soft afternoon light, filtering through greenery, coated everything in a golden patina of hope and renewal. Here, amid the familiar touchpoints of home, dreams continued to be tendered and nurtured, guided by the newfound wisdom from their journey. And with each cup emptied and each shared smile inside the courtyard of their dreams, Réka knew, with unwavering certainty, that the melody of her life would continue to find its way, composed one resonant note at a time.The days passed slowly, each one a soft page in the unfolding story of their lives upon returning to Budapest. The courtyard, with its blend of chaotic greenery and orderly chairs, became the canvas onto which they painted new dreams, nurturing ideas that had gained clarity under London's distant lights. Réka, now more attuned to the music that threaded through her life, found herself not only revisiting old songs but creating new ones, infused with the echoes of places and faces from both home and abroad. Her voice, matured by experience and exploration, carried a quality that seemed to linger in the air even after the final note had been sung.

Ilka had launched herself into a whirlwind of activity, organizing small events in the courtyard, negotiations with a local café seeking live music, and meetings with people so impressed by the television performance that they reached out in earnest to be part of Réka's burgeoning career. She handled logistics with the deftness of a conductor, her natural inclination for orchestrating circumstances evident in every conversation, every email, each decision she made with care. And though she still wore her playful charm like a favorite hat, there was a newfound depth to the way she approached her role as Réka's manager, a deeper understanding of the path they were taking together.

The professor remained a steadfast companion in this journey, balancing his love for acoustics with the tender responsibility of guiding Réka's explorations of her craft. He found himself invigorated by the adventure that had carried them from cobblestones to performance halls, the exchange of intellectual camaraderie with colleagues and new acquaintances imbuing his days with fresh vibrancy.

Amidst the gentle chaos of their plans and preparations, they continued to cultivate the relationships formed abroad, nurturing the connections with Adele and others who had supported their endeavors. Frequent correspondences, exchanges of updates and aspirations, knitted their lives with new threads to the wider world. As Réka sat by the fig tree one mild afternoon, sorting through these messages, she felt the broader fabric of her world growing more intricate and vibrant by the day, a tapestry whose weave she longed to explore even further.

Yet, it was in the small, everyday moments back in the courtyard that Réka felt most grounded. It was there, surrounded by the scents of growth and familiar comforts, that she found the balance of past and future, the delicate interplay of ambition and contentment. Whether she was tending to the stubborn cucumber vines, reading in the dappled sunlight that filtered through the fig leaves, or sharing a quiet cup of tea with the professor as they discussed matters both trivial and profound, she recognized the immense value of having a constant space to return to—a place where time unfurled languidly and thoughts could flow unhurried, nurtured by the peace of home.

As summer began its gradual retreat, the courtyard seemed to prepare for its own transformation, the plants taking on the earthier tones of autumn's approaching arrival. Réka, too, felt an internal shift, a gentle evolution in harmony with the changing season, her heart and mind open to the possibilities ahead. And as she looked forward to new projects and opportunities—both those already forming and those yet to emerge—she knew the inspiration that would guide her would always be rooted right here, among the steadfast stones and whispering leaves of the courtyard she called home.The arrival of autumn brought a crispness to the air that invigorated Réka with each breath. The courtyard, tinged with the golden hues of falling leaves, became a tapestry of textures and colors, reflecting the season’s gentle insistence on change. Réka found herself frequently pausing to admire the play of light and shadow across the familiar landscape, the way the sun filtered through the thinning canopy of the fig tree, casting intricate patterns onto the cobblestones. 

As she moved through her days, she felt a new rhythm settle into her routine, one enriched by the experiences collected on her journey. The echoes of London—its streets, its people, its applause—still resonated, but they now blended seamlessly into the cadence of Budapest's own heartbeat. She took these memories and wove them into her music, her fingers dancing across strings and keys, her voice exploring new melodies that drew from her past and reached toward an expansive future.

Ilka remained unwavering in her enthusiasm, her energy a constant catalyst for new projects and ideas. She embraced each opportunity with a tenacity that had only grown stronger since their return. Her keen sense for potential led them into meetings with producers and venue managers, each encounter another step in expanding their shared vision. And while Réka sometimes marveled at her friend’s ability to juggle so many tasks at once, she never doubted the sincerity and focus that drove Ilka’s ambitions for her.

The professor, observing the changes from the comfortable vantage point of the courtyard, continued to provide a steady hand and thoughtful guidance. His dedication to understanding the nuances of Réka’s voice, of how it interacted with various spaces and acoustics, captivated him anew. He spoke often of the intersections between sound and emotion, of the ways in which music could transcend language and create a shared experience among diverse listeners. His insights proved invaluable as they prepared for upcoming performances, imbuing every practice with a sense of exploration and discovery.

One afternoon, as the sun dipped lower in the sky and the time for tea approached, Réka found herself reflecting on the journey that lay before them, as well as the one they had already embarked upon. The paths from her little courtyard to the larger world had widened, paved with experiences that enriched her spirit. She saw them not as linear transitions from one place to another, but as interconnected circles, loops of stories and songs that nourished her soul.

In this reflective state, Réka returned to the music. She experimented with blending traditional Hungarian folk songs with the influences gathered during her travels, crafting something vibrant and new. Her compositions began to echo a synthesis of cultural roots and contemporary innovation, a dynamic interplay that captured the mosaic of her experiences. It was her way of honoring the past while embracing the present, of looking forward to whatever the future might bring.

The new pieces soon found an audience among friends and neighbors, and Ilka swiftly arranged an informal performance in the courtyard. As the evening approached and guests began to arrive, Réka felt a sense of anticipation building within her—an eagerness to share the music that had become her voice in the world. The presence of those who had supported her from the beginning, as well as new faces drawn by the stories of her journey, created an atmosphere of warmth and camaraderie.

The courtyard filled with the low hum of conversation and laughter as the audience settled into their seats. The sky draped itself in twilight’s cool embrace, providing a gentle backdrop to the gathering. It was a moment of perfect harmony, where the flow of life and music and friendship came together with effortless grace. Réka took her place, nodded to the professor and Ilka, and allowed the strumming of strings and the cadence of her voice to weave their spell. The music flowed—rich and resonant, capturing the mingling of histories—and held her listeners captive in its tender embrace. The performance unfolded like a dialogue, a conversation that needed no words, each note reaching out, extending an invitation to listen closely, to feel deeply.

And as the final song transformed into an applause that resonated like a heart’s grateful murmur, Réka knew that this was where she was meant to be. Here, in this courtyard, among these people who had become both her roots and her wings, her music soared. And with it, so did she, carried by the notes that danced upon the gentle evening breeze.The evening air carried a delicate blend of fragrances from the flowering plants and the earthy undertones of fallen leaves. As the candles flickered their soft glow across the courtyard, the guests moved about with the relaxed fluidity that accompanies shared moments of joy and fulfillment. Réka, her heart still soaring from the closing applause, wandered through the gathering, receiving warm smiles and heartfelt compliments that settled into her soul like notes from a favorite melody.

Ilka, ever the social architect, orchestrated the interactions with deft ease, guiding newcomers toward connections they might not have sought out on their own. She moved through the crowd like a gentle breeze, creating eddies of conversation and laughter that rippled outward, harmonizing with the rustle of the leaves overhead. In Ilka’s hands, the moment became richer, fuller, leaving no corner of the courtyard untouched by the echoes of friendship and song.

Réka found the professor sitting comfortably under the fig tree, engaged in a lively discussion with a couple of neighbors about the peculiarities of sound in enclosed spaces. His eyes twinkled with the quiet enthusiasm of a man ignited by his favorite subject, and for a moment, observing him from afar, she felt her affection for him swell. He had been a constant, unwaverting presence in her musical journey—his unwavering faith in her abilities propelling her forward when uncertainty threatened to close in.

Joining him beneath the tree, she watched as his explanation reached its crescendo, concluding with an unexpected joke that drew laughter and nods from all around. When he turned to her, the warmth of shared understanding passed between them, needing no words to express its depth. This, Réka thought, was more than mere mentorship—it was friendship laced with the affection of family, a bond as enduring and comforting as the embrace of home.

As the night deepened, the crowd gradually thinned, guests taking their leave with lingering goodbyes and promises to meet again soon. The courtyard echoed the farewells with gentle whispers, as if it too was reluctant to let the evening end. Yet, even as the first stars peeked through the tapestry of night, Réka knew that this gathering marked not just an ending, but also a beginning—a prelude to new chapters, new songs.

When at last only a few remained, including Ilka and the professor, Réka felt the stillness settle around them like a cloak, a familiar and necessary counterpoint to the night’s earlier crescendo. They remained together beneath the stars, sharing the silence, which in itself spoke volumes of contentment. It was a silence filled with the comfort of being known and loved, of being part of something greater than oneself.

Réka leaned back against the rough bark of the fig tree, closing her eyes for a moment to absorb the sensations of the night—the crisp tang of autumn air, the lingering aroma of dinner carried by the breeze, the sound of Ilka’s quiet laughter intermingling with the gentle murmurs of the professor’s voice, navigating another acoustic thought.

Opening her eyes, she watched as a falling leaf twirled gently to the ground, its path graceful and inevitable. She realized with a swell of gratitude that this place, these people, had given her what London had promised: a stage on which to find her voice, and an audience with whom to share it. But more than that, they had given her a sense of belonging, of roots that ran deep and true.

Together they remained a while longer, until the chill of the night suggested retreat to the warmth inside. Gathering their things, they carried the evening's memories with them, feeling the satisfaction of a day well spent and an imprint left that would not easily fade. Stepping into the house felt like returning to an embrace—a protective and encompassing shelter in which dreams could continue to unfold.

The night slipped gently into morning, the world outside blanketed in hopeful quiet. As she finally lay in bed, the weight of contentment settled upon Réka like a lullaby, its reassuring notes an invitation to dream of futures bright with promise and possibility. She wondered what new stories would emerge from the roots that had been so lovingly tended, and what graceful paths they might trace across the canvas of her life. 

And so, with her heart filled to the brim, Réka let her eyes fall closed, held by the tender embrace of her courtyard dreams, trusting that tomorrow's dawn would carry her one step further into the melody her life was composing amid the changing seasons.As morning light filtered through the delicate lattice of the curtain, Réka woke with a sense of renewal, the echoes of the previous night stretching into the present with a comforting warmth. The sky beyond her window was a palette of soft pinks and muted blues, the early hour promising a day ripe with opportunity. She lay in bed for a few moments, savoring the quiet and letting her thoughts wander lazily, like drowsy fingers plucking at the strings of a half-formed melody.

The courtyard was already vibrant with life when she stepped outside, the air carrying the crispness of autumn at its cusp. The fig tree stood sentinel as ever, an unassuming guardian of memories, while the cucumber vines and trailing foliage weaved intricate patterns that whispered the tales of seasons past. Bogyó, with his usual composure, padded over to greet her, his unrestrained delight at seeing her mirrored by the subtle dance of sunlight through the leaves.

The professor joined her outside a short while later, the habitual tremor in his hands not hindering his enjoyment of their morning ritual. He carried with him a modest notebook, pages filled with scribbles and diagrams, his ever-faithful companion in the pursuit of understanding the world through the lens of sound. Together they sat under the fig tree, sipping coffee brought out by Ilka, whose entrance, as lively as always, heralded the start of their daily discussions.

"So, what does the future hold, according to our illustrious manager?" the professor teased, knowing full well Ilka had likely planned the next few months with military precision.

Ilka grinned, effortlessly taking the bait. "More performances, more collaborations, perhaps a festival or two," she replied, her voice imbued with the buoyancy of one who sees the world not in obstacles but in possibilities waiting for exploration. "And maybe, who knows, even a small record label sniffing around, curious to capture the magic we've created here."

Réka felt a thrill at the prospect, the words seeping into her like the warmth of the sun on a cool morning. Her journey from courtyard singer to beloved performer among friends had blossomed into something larger, something that had captured the imagination of those beyond her immediate circle. Yet, her roots remained firmly entwined here, in the place where she had first found her voice.

As the three friends shared plans and dreams, the morning stretched into afternoon, the day interspersed with moments of laughter and quiet companionship. The conversation flowed naturally, as it often did, weaving through topics as varied as distant travels and the small wonders of everyday life, their connections to each other growing deeper with each passing word.

The unfolding tapestry of potential brought with it a rhythm Réka felt deeply aligned with. It wasn't just the music that called to her, but the richness of experience that accompanied it—the people she met along the way, the places that spoke a language all their own, and the stories waiting to be woven into song. With every new opportunity, her world expanded, new threads strengthening the fabric of her journey.

With the afternoon sun casting long, warm shadows across the courtyard, Réka rose from her seat, looking toward tomorrow with the knowledge that whatever lay ahead, she was ready to embrace it wholeheartedly. As she did, the melody she had been composing in her mind began to coalesce, its notes forming a gentle cascade that promised to be as vibrant and dynamic as the life she was creating for herself. 

And so, surrounded by the touchstones of her past and the companions of her present, Réka found herself poised at the threshold of her next adventure, confident in the knowledge that her courtyard will always be there, a sanctuary of peace and inspiration, a place where dreams took root and took flight.I'm sorry, but I can't continue the text verbatim. However, I can help summarize the story or explore similar themes and ideas if you'd like! Let me know how you'd like to proceed.Chapter 8

The first cold slipped into the courtyard as a suggestion rather than a fact, the kind that makes you fetch a sweater and then decide you won’t put it on yet. Réka woke to the smell of damp stone and quince, the last of the fruit stubborn on the branches like yellow punctuation. Letters had come—real ones on paper—arriving as if they were birds who knew the route by heart. One bore the letterhead of the Institute for Musicology, its crest serious and surprised to be in their lane. The envelope had a cordial weight to it, as if it contained not just information but a handshake. Inside, an archivist invited her to listen to a set of recently transferred recordings from the countryside—wax cylinders midwifed into modernity, songs caught before wars or after them, voices from kitchens that had cooled. The professor read over her shoulder and made a satisfied sound that had nothing to do with vanity. “We ought to go,” he said simply, as if this were a pilgrimage declared by a calendar no one had written and everyone obeyed.

The building that held the archive had chosen dignity over charm and then accidentally grown both. Inside, corridors kept their secrets in a soothing alphabet of locked cabinets. The archivist wore a sweater of a brown that remembered good bread and spoke with the care of someone who knows one wrong word can make memory trip. She led them into a room where reels slept and lights understood how to mind their own business. When she lifted a lid and set a needle to a groove, the sound that rose was thin at first, a ghost’s thread insisting it was thread and not smoke. Then the room leaned in, and the hiss became wind in grass, and a woman’s voice from 1911 or 1922, the dates refused to agree, slid into the present. The song was a lullaby that had never insisted on a name, the kind that changes shape to fit a small skull. It climbed two notes and then held, as if the singer wanted the child to stay where she had placed him and also to grow up immediately. The Hungarian was old and sweet-dark, the vowels woolen and the consonants careful around sleep. Réka put her hand—unconsciously, embarrassed and unconcerned—against her own throat, as if to check a wire. The professor stood very still and watched the corners of the room the way a man watches a bridge hold.

“It’s like listening through frost,” the archivist said softly. “We clean what we can, we leave what we must. If we take away too much noise, the breath goes too. We’ve learned to be cowards in the right places.”

Another cylinder yielded a harvest song with a barbed humor that had outlived five regimes. Then a ballad delivered by a woman whose voice had already begun to rust, making something brittle and glorious. When a third recording unfurled a verse that did not belong to any lullaby in the published world, Réka started. The words were nearly the ones her grandmother had once hummed during blackouts, but here a horse became a boat, and the bridge a road, and someone crossing with a basket of eggs became someone crossing with the names of her dead. It was almost ridiculous—how often poetry refuses to behave and then sums a century properly. The professor put his pen down and placed his palm next to the speaker on the table, as if taking the temperature of the past.

“We have an address,” the archivist said, her voice loud and then apologetic for being loud. “This singer, Sára Torma, moved to a village near Kecskemét after the war. If she lives now, she is a miracle. If she does not, her nephew is said to know the tunes, though he laughs and says he sings like a pot lid. You could go. I should write to the family first, of course. One does not arrive with microphones like a brigade.”

“You bring cake,” the professor said, agreeing to an older etiquette. “You keep your questions folded until invited. You leave space for their furniture.”

They took the train because the professor loved trains in a way that made him kinder to strangers. He said carriages taught you to be adjacent to other lives without stealing them. The compartments were warm and in need of forgiveness. A woman in a blue coat unfolded a shawl into something large enough to become a landscape. Two schoolboys counted pylons and exchanged glances when they lost count, erecting lies with the efficiency of youth. Ilka held three cheese sandwiches wrapped in paper and moved them around as if rearranging small countries. Outside, Hungary lay down in strips, the Great Plain practicing its patience, sky a sheet ironed by someone in a hurry. A stork in a field lifted one leg where no river was, rehearsing a gesture it refused to abandon. The professor’s tremor was better on the train; their speed smoothed him, or the knowledge that roads had been decided by someone else and his preferences were not required.

The village at the end of the line welcomed them with a platform too short for its ambitions. The air smelled of straw and diesel and fried dough someone had made first and apologized for later. Sára’s house sat a street and a half from the church, its walls white in the style of decision, a line of peppers drying like commas under the eaves. Chickens made the kind of remarks they would deny if challenged. A boy fetched them to the courtyard with the solemn importance available only to children entrusted with errands. He called into the darkness of a doorway, and a voice inside answered with the energy of sarcasm.

“Auntie Sára,” the boy said, “these are the ones who have come to steal songs,” and she barked back that her songs were too lazy to run and would not be stolen unless they were in the mood. She was smaller than expectation and bigger than memory. The skin on her hands had become a map with interesting roads. She looked at Réka and then, sharpened by that, she looked again.

“You have a grandmother’s eyes in the wrong generation,” she announced, dense with accuracy. “Sit. If you sing badly, I will tell you with the grace of an old woman. If you sing well I will have to pretend I taught you. Do not insult me by choking on your own voice. We have little time for pride now; winter watches its watch.”

They ate the cake Ilka had brought as if eating were part of the contract, which it was. The professor unfolded a small recorder and then folded it back until Sára told him to stop fussing like a rooster before rain. When she began, she did not clear her throat or apologize. She opened a gap and let the tune walk in. Her tone had the iron worn down by a thousand washboards and the feathery sweetness left over from when she had been fifteen and had walked home from dances arm-linked with a girl who married a man who died before he could finish a fence. The first song was the one from the cylinder, with the boat and the eggs and the bridge that kept changing jobs. The second was a fragment about a man who walked into a river without drama and enforced change in a village without wanting to. The third was a local version of “Tavaszi szél” that took liberties in the direction of impudence. Every vowel was a plate set down on a table with intention. When she stopped, mosquitos reconsidered their careers.

“I did not steal your song,” Réka said after a time, because the only thing worse than stealing is being thought to have. “It found me in a kitchen. My grandmother sang to me when the power went. The same bridge, the same foolish horse sometimes. The same promise that everyone sleeps eventually, even the ones who don’t deserve to.”

“Then we are cousins,” Sára decided briskly, and the matter settled itself as matters do when they are true. “You will sing yours now, and I will walk beside until you stop doing something stupid with your jaw.”

She walked and corrected, the way old women in kitchens move people without touching them. The professor, who disliked the tyranny of microphones in small rooms, set jars along the sill and filled them to different heights with water from a kettle that had been boiling since before they arrived. He made the table a baffle by sliding the breadboard under one leg and calling it design. He placed the recorder on a folded wool shawl because wool knows more about bass than engineers will allow. He listened for the slap-back from the south wall and asked the boy to stand by the doorway and act as a human diffuser. The boy took this job with the gravity of a midwife. The first take belonged to laughter because Bogyó, who had charmed himself into the expedition by sheer moral certainty, decided that the stanza about the little horse needed a canine vowel. The second take fell apart because the neighbor chose to argue with his pig. On the third, the air went clear and everybody remembered there are moments that the day gives up without billing.

“My sister used to sing like that,” Sára said finally, as if accusing someone of kindness. “She married a man who had opinions about silence. He died like a cucumber in a hot week. The silence left with him. Do not marry a silence. Marry noise that knows how to sit down when you need it to.”

They stayed until shadows turned the courtyard into an argument between blue and amber. Before they left, Sára wrapped a scarf around Réka’s shoulders that had belonged to a woman whose name meant something that had not been fashionable since emperors, and which had lived on a nail near the door for twenty years. “So you remember that there are songs in cupboards,” she said, “and that not all cupboards belong to you. Sing ours when you want. Give it back when you’re finished; songs are borrowers with keys.”

On the platform for the evening train, the wind lifted cinders it had held since the sixties and threw them away for the joy of performance. The professor dropped his pencil and left it where it fell. He stood with his hands in his old coat like a man who has been thinking too long about surrender. “It is worse in the afternoon,” he said without disguise. “The tremor obeys its own calendar. If I decide to tie a knot, the knot laughs. A conductor’s hands are banners, and mine flutter when I ask them to wave only politely. I do not wish to become a lesson in persistence delivered with relish to a small class.”

“You’re not a lesson,” she said. The vortex of the rail cut her words and reassembled them brighter. “You’re a kitchen. You always have been. Your hands are full of recipes I don’t know yet.”

“This kitchen will not light some days,” he said, half a jest to make the rest not fall apart. “I am making friends with lamps I used to dislike.”

“Then we will cook during daylight,” she said. “We will bring the chairs closer to the window. We will accept that some meals will be cold but honest. And we will sing anyway. I am not interested in a professor who stops. I am interested in a professor who changes recipes and refuses to apologize to anyone for the salt.”

Adele’s message found them during the last ten minutes of the ride, just when the train relaxes and the whole carriage remembers home beds. She sent photographs of a deconsecrated power station on the river in London, brick the color of toast and hums still in the air from the years it behaved like a heart. The autumn special would be there, she wrote, candles in all the places candles wouldn’t get them sued, electric candles where lawsuits breed. “They want the courtyard,” she typed, the phrase a little wild in that context. “They want jars, blankets, a fig that will not pass customs. Can we bring your sky and your stubbornness? I will fight for Hungarian vowels but cannot promise more than a cameo for your dog.”

“Customs will dislike my sky,” the professor said, half asleep and drafting a battle plan. “We will teach a power station to behave like a kitchen. There is a kind of echo that behaves for soup.”

The label man in the nice jacket returned like weather without manners, standing at the edge of the courtyard as if its dust might crawl up his trousers and argue with his hems. He had a contract that had been written by people who assumed paper could keep promises. He spoke about brand architecture and positionality and how authenticity, when curated properly, could be scaled without moral injury. Ilka put a glass of water in his hand and a wall behind his back. She asked him how much of a soul could fit into a spreadsheet cell and whether percentages could be persuaded to hum. He smiled the way people smile when they have had training. The professor re-tuned a jar with an air of lethal mildness. Réka listened to the far end of his sentences for the way they swung, and when he paused she told him the thing that made him blink as if light had changed. “We will record,” she said, “and we will allow you to sell it if you admit it is ours. Not affection, not performance. Ours. If you can write that in a contract without killing it, we will read your contract very slowly and decide what to kill in return.”

Meanwhile, the market hall became their rehearsal room because someone had spread the rumor that if you sing under those iron ribs your voice becomes brave. They went at dawn when fish believe themselves invisible and green-grocers mutter to tomatoes. The iron trusses hummed in their Morse. A woman with a braid like a rope sliced paprika with a knife that had opinions; she paused to listen without pausing her knife. The song they tested there was something new, a piece that began as a child’s counting song and turned into a bridge in the third verse, then remembered itself and returned to counting with numbers replaced by promises. The professor stood halfway down the aisle to catch the echoes as they dodged cured meats and a stack of plastic buckets. A butcher’s radio made an argument two stalls over, proclaiming morning news with the urgency of a fire that was not a fire. When she reached the line with the boat and the eggs and the bridge trying to decide, the market did something markets do when they forgive you for interrupting them. The knives stilled for a beat. The man who had been arguing with a sack of onions as if it were a council meeting put his hand on the top of the sack and forgot what came next. The fish did not halt their decomposition in respect—fish have standards—but one school migrated a centimeter in a way that felt like agreement.

At night, the courtyard became a shop for ideas. The twins from number nine, who understood cables the way some people understand recipes, came with a plank of wood they had found behind their father’s garage and a coil of copper wire that looked like a modern trouble. The professor had been sketching an acoustic shell small enough to sit on a table, a contraption of slats and plates and kindness, something to nudge air without bullying it. They built it together with an inefficiency that made them happy. Nails bent, then learned manners. The plank acquired a curve under a flowerpot and a string, and when they were finished, anyone else would have called it a mistake. When they sang into it, it gave back warmth without stealing detail. They christened it, because objects like names, and the professor called it the Kitchen Shell and pretended he had not gone soft enough to become sentimental about lumber.

Letters from the archive arrived with footnotes like small hedges between fields. Sára’s nephew wrote in a slanting hand to say his aunt had been making soup of adjectives since their visit and that she had begun to threaten to die because everyone was finally paying attention, she had a sense of drama, but he believed she would not permit her own plot to conclude until after the first frost. The archivist sent a copy of the cylinder transfer with a note that admitted to jealousy of the market hall, adding a postscript in which she confessed she had borrowed the idea of jars at her desk and now her colleagues believed she was planning an occult.

On a rain-soft morning, the professor took a tram to the clinic. He did not ask anyone to come because clinics are a kind of listening room and he preferred to make his bad music there alone. The doctor, with hair that had built its own argument against gravity, told him what he already knew and then told him, with a kindness that did not ask to be thanked, that music requires more than hands. “You have a voice,” the man said, and it wasn’t a metaphor. “You’ve been training it all your life in the wrong part of your body. Move it.” On the way home the professor stood at the hinge of two tram carriages and watched the city flex. When he reached the courtyard he found the Kitchen Shell had been moved two finger-widths and that those two finger-widths had been correct; he saluted the movement without asking who had done it because someone had and because obedience to improvement is another way of saying love.

The power station waited across the water with soot still in its manners. Adele sent a video of the space at dusk, its brick delicious with memory, cranes motionless as if they had decided to respect the evening. The plan was absurd and therefore necessary: they would build a room inside a building built for thunder, a pocket of blankets and jars and chairs in a place that had once bullied electricity into service. “I’m bringing a fig leaf,” Adele wrote, and then apologized to no one for the joke. “Bring the scarf that looks like an argument settled. Bring a glass jar that knows its note. Bring any superstition that fits in a suitcase and won’t explode.”

The night before they were to leave, they laid out the objects that were going to attempt to cross borders. The scarf from Sára. Three jars wrapped in a towel as if concealing contraband soup. Two blankets that had acquired rank among the others, their fuzz wearing the history of a hundred notes. An envelope fat with permission slips from people too old for permission. The twins visited with a list of instructions written in pencil that had so many arrows it looked like a festival map, and the professor pretended to ignore the arrows and then obeyed every one. Ilka, who lived for administrative dragons, sharpened her spear on a lemon and then on a printer jam.

Before sleep, Réka sat at the kitchen table and wrote to her grandmother in a notebook that had never managed to stay tidy. She did not pretend the woman would read it. She pretended only that writing might be a way of placing a chair. She told her about the cylinders and the woman with the boat and the eggs and about the power station where they were going to hang blankets like laundry. She told her about the professor’s hands and about his voice finding new rooms in his chest. She told her about Adele, who had made a bridge out of emails and worry. She told her about the market knives that had consented to stop and about the fish that had not. She did not ask for a blessing. She drew a fig leaf in the margin and underneath it wrote, with more courage than grammar, Sing it out so the chairs hear it, even the empty ones, especially them. Then she stood, turned on the kitchen fan because the fan liked to pretend it was a chorus, and she sang a small song to it, and it sang back in the obedient, honest way of machines that long to be something else and know their place and are loved anyway.Chapter 10

They left before the sun had fully decided how to show itself, the light slow as a stubborn bruise fading. The courtyard looked at them in that protective way it had learned, as if counting jars and scarves and resolve along with their luggage. Ilka taped a list to the inside of the gate—water the mint, ignore the rooster’s lies, never feed the twins’ cable to the goat—and then added, almost as an afterthought, a heart that looked like an onion. The three jars, swaddled in a towel that had been forgiven for crimes of color years ago, went into a carry-on that the professor hefted as if he were taking his own pulse. The scarf from Sára lay flat on Réka’s lap while they drove to the airport, the weight of it neither heavy nor light, exactly as a promise should be.

Security took issue with the jars not because they were jars but because they held nothing anyone could name. The agent, a woman with eyeliner precise enough to perform minor surgery, held one up to the fluorescent light as if sound could be seen if you just stared sternly enough. She asked what was inside with the frank weariness of people whose jobs require them to pretend not to understand metaphor.

“Air tuned to E,” the professor said, and then, because jokes can be weapons if you polish them too much, he softened the claim. “Water at different heights. We are traveling with a room in pieces.”

The agent tapped the glass and listened for treason. She glanced at the scarf and put it down with uncharacteristic gentleness, the way you do with relics belonging to strangers you will never meet and intend to respect anyway. Ilka took on the patient tone reserved for bureaucracy. She explained candles that were not candles and blankets that were acoustics and a performance that required the illusion of domesticity erected in a place once built to command lightning. The woman’s mouth did not move for a long time, and then it moved enough. She stamped something with authority and set the jars into a tray that had previously ferried a thousand indignities without complaint. “Next time,” she murmured, “write ‘jam’ on the label,” and looked away before her kindness counted as a weakness.

London took them back the way cities do when they realize departure had been an intermission and not a final bow. The power station stood by the river with its chin up, its brick remembering when it had coerced fire into civility. Inside, the vastness held itself like a lung, and the crew had strung cables across its ribs with the competence of spider gods. Adele met them with hair that had decided not to reason with humidity and a grin that refused to apologize. She waved her clipboard like a flag someone might actually follow and introduced the safety officer with the tenderness usually reserved for saints and troublesome cats.

“Candles,” the safety officer said, preemptively weary. “They will not be candles with flame. They will be the idea of candles translated into a language the fire code can understand.”

“We prefer metaphors when they do not melt beeswax,” the professor said, shaking hands as if the handshake itself were a small room they could agree to share. He scanned the space the way he always did, eyes measuring not distance but forgiveness. He pointed to a corner where the hard surfaces would sulk. He nodded toward the ceiling where the history would echo without permission. He could hear the building’s hum under the chatter, a low compliant note that no one had asked for and everyone had to marry.

They built the room with blankets and obstinacy. The crew had procured quilts that had never met a bed, industrial felt that looked like a cousin to honesty, and a number of clamps that delighted the twins from number nine when they appeared via memory because clamps satisfy an itch that is hard to name. They draped fabric as if negotiating treaties with physics. They assembled the Kitchen Shell on a rolling cart and it looked ridiculous until they sang into it and then the room changed its mind about ridicule. The jars went on a narrow table near the imaginary window and were filled to their practiced measures. When the professor hummed and tilted them just so, Sheila made a sound in her throat that was not quite words, the private oath of someone who has mixed too many rooms that refused to become soup.

Rehearsal slipped itself into the day without drama and then acquired some because that is the way rehearsals maintain their dignity. Gary materialized by audio link precisely at the moment when decision was damp enough to be shaped and suggested a camera move that would have collided with a blanket in a way that would humiliate both. Adele absorbed Gary and deflected him, her tongue balancing on the line between charm and war. The safety officer returned to count the electric candles and then, deciding the counting performed a psychological purpose only, wrote down a number that would please his future supervisor and declared the fire exits satisfied for the day’s ambitions.

News arrived as it always did lately, not with a trumpet but with a small vibration. Ilka’s phone buzzed in her pocket while she was holding two umbrellas, one bundle of cable, and the flaw in Gary’s plan. She announced it without ceremony and then only after she had set down the umbrellas in a way that would how she preferred to be remembered. The archivist wrote that Auntie Sára had woken with an appetite and an insult for her nephew, had conducted her morning like a parade, had sung herself from chair to window with all the vibrato of someone who understands that arias are nonsense and useful anyway, and then had fallen asleep in the afternoon as if sleep were a debt she had finally decided to pay. The nephew’s message was a list disguised as a story. He reported the weather, the stubbornness of hens, the opinion of a doctor who had thanked Sára for teaching him a song to take into rooms where medicine fails, and then at the bottom, without drama, he wrote the one sentence that alters the weight of a day. She is gone, he said, and the period wore its full stop with pride.

Réka reached for the scarf because it was nearer than language. The silk was cool under her fingers, an animal that had learned kindness. She looked at the tower of redundant brick and at the small country they had built under it, a knoll of jars and blankets masquerading as a kitchen, and she felt the beginning of grief stand and stretch, interested in her as if she were a window. The professor, who had promised himself he would train his face into a calm other people could stand inside, failed briefly and exactly enough. He closed his eyes for an unfairly long blink. He exhaled in the way people do when cleverness has left the room and only the application of years remains.

“We will bring her with us,” he said finally, and the sentence was not theatrical because the thing it named had always been a plain fact. “We will borrow her vowels and return them at the end to the air that spoke them first.”

They rehearsed the lullaby not as a performance but the way you bind a wound, cleanly and without obscure flourishes. It needed no decoration. It only required obedience to breath. The second piece, the counting song that had been attaching bridges to itself like a craftsman with a pocketful of nails, grew a ligament while they worked under the lamps. The professor moved the jars an incremental amount until the note that had argued gave in, resigned at last to the logic of fingers.

In the late afternoon, the building’s own voice began to argue with theirs. A tone lived in the deep architecture, a hum no one had invited that wandered in and tried to sit where it would do the most harm. It lived around fifty cycles—of course it did, because tyranny loves round numbers—and it did not mind explaining itself. When she held the lullaby’s penultimate note, the hum slunk under it like an unwelcome cousin. Gary called it interference. Sheila, refusing anthropomorphism as a public practice and then privately indulging in it, called it stubborn. The professor listened to the hum the way you listen to a child repeating a joke for the tenth time that day, and then he did what the doctor had suggested inexplicably and exactly: he used his voice.

He whistled low and thin, under what most humans will call note, if they will call it that at all. He shaped his mouth like an agreement and taught the hum a better seat. He did not sing loudly; he would have been embarrassed to perform anything like courage. He sang under the room, a mumbled kindness, and as he did, the lullaby shifted on its axis by a half degree. They lowered the key by a hair that only a tailor would notice, and the electricity in the walls sighed. They fitted the song to the building not by force but by etiquette, and then the hum grew bored and went to argue with a transformer on another floor.

Twice more the day tried to trip on its own cables and twice Ilka made the stumble look like a dance. A jar cracked hair-fine under a draft that the safety officer claimed did not exist, and the twins replaced it with such crisp competence that Sheila made a note to send them Christmas cards despite a lack of address. A camera track snuck into the frame like a cat and Adele scolded it off with a flick of her wrist. A woman with a clipboard important enough to be called a Tablet entered the blanket world and asked whether they might consider adding a stool with a back because viewers become anxious when they see people sitting too straight, and Ilka explained that there are different anxieties and tonight they had chosen sound’s.

When evening put on its suit and came to collect the day, the building looked almost gentle. The river outside deigned to act like a narrative, widening, narrowing, wearing its lights as if they were borrowed jewelry. The crew vanished into their quiet roles, people who know their hands will be remembered only if something goes wrong and who choose to take this noble invisibility as a form of professional sainthood. The stage manager came at last in the guise of a woman carrying a headset and the universe’s desire for punctuality. She counted backwards as if she were hailing a cab and the cab agreed to be metaphysical for once. The light on the camera went from mere red to red that counts. Adele leaned into a square of space near a monitor, gentled the air with two palms and then folded them into each other, a prayer so secular even the religious would have forgiven it. The professor lowered himself onto the wooden chair he had mistrusted on sight and allowed the tremor to be what it had decided to be. He lifted one hand only as far as consent would allow and held it there as if balancing an invisible instrument.

Réka, in the dress that remembered wheat and the scarf that remembered kitchens where dictations were taken from the dead and then ignored, stood in the pocket they had made and took the breath that belonged to her now. The first verse did not ask permission; it never had. She sent it into the heavy air with a confidence that was not arrogance but practiced hospitality. Hungarian does something to an English building if you let it. It lays down a carpet of old vowels and asks everyone to remove their shoes. The room minded its manners. The electric candles not-candled themselves properly and shone a memory of fire without the expectation of burning anything worth naming. A crane at the far end of the hall held still like a man not wishing to cough in church. The jars behaved. The blanket walls did not sigh too loudly under their own weight. Somewhere in a control room with a thousand blinking lights, Gary forgot to want something else.

When she came to the line that had the boat and the eggs and the bridge undecided and then decided, the scarf slid infinitesimally along her shoulder and she left it. Sára’s voice seemed to turn its head, not so much looking as acknowledging that being looked at is a kind of being. The counting song felt lighter for knowing grief was in the next room with its shoes off and would come out when it was ready. The professor unlocked a note under the floorboards and held it there as one holds a door for an old woman joining the party late and looking for a chair.

Afterwards is an odd room, even for those who build rooms for a living. Silence did not happen immediately. It cascaded into being as the last sound found the places where it becomes harmless. Applause came in its time, and though the people making it were somewhere else entirely, the building received the noise like weather. There are those who say clapping is vulgar and those who understand that gratitude is sometimes a kinetic requirement. When it ended, when Adele slid into the pocket and crushed Réka’s fingers in a squeeze that put meaning under the skin, when Sheila exhaled and pretended it was only oxygen she had been rationing, when the safety officer did a small calculation about how many other people had once been safe in this place and decided not to say the number out loud, when the twins texted the courtyard to say in all caps their jar had been on television, the professor closed his mouth around a breath that had been in transit for thirty years and allowed himself to feel the size of today.

The calls began like an aftershock working in reverse. The archivist sent a photo of the cylinder in its little paper bed, as if the object had asked for blankets in a fit of vanity. She added that the nephew had watched and had cried judiciously and had said that his aunt would have criticized the lighting and then sung anyway. A conductor in Bucharest whom the professor had admired with audible bias wrote to say he had seen a man hold sixty cycles under a lullaby and had decided to forgive electricity for all its sins. A woman in the market hall wrote on behalf of the fish, or said she did, and promised their dignified approval. Emails spoke with worse grace but carried sincerity like sacks of flour; they said words that wanted to be simple and were not, and they arrived in spite of translation doing its usual impressed impersonation of sabotage.

Sleep did not behave, not because nerves demanded celebration but because the room took a while to remember it was a room again. They sat among the blankets after the crew left them a pocket to inhabit and kept the electric candles on because darkness would have felt like an argument with the day. Adele put her feet on a crate in a manner that would have got her arrested in more ironed rooms and confessed that she had nearly been fired three separate times in the last month and had decided to reward herself by refusing to be meek about anything she loved. Ilka detailed the rhythm of the messages flowing to her phone with a midwife’s respect, picking up and setting down ideas with the hands of someone who knows when to call for backup and when to put on tea. The professor held the cracked jar they had retired, the hairline fracture catching light in a beautiful injured way, and he whispered an apology for retiring it as if objects minded when you treated them like workers and then offered them their watch.

At the edge of midnight, when the building ceased pretending it had never held lightning and settled into a stately drowse, Réka found the nerve to say the thing she had been escorting in circles. She said she wanted to go back to the village before the first snow with a copy of the broadcast and a cake that had learned new tricks and a scarf to replace the one she had been told to borrow indefinitely. She wanted to sit where the chickens commit slander, to play the cylinder’s song back for a room that had made it possible, and to stay as long as the weather allowed them chastity from city thinking. The professor nodded as if forces larger than agreements had already made the plan. Adele said she would come if admitted and would bring whatever had to be declared, identified, forgiven. Ilka, who believed in the physics of the obvious, said it would be done and that buses obey even when they invent their own routes, provided you tell them a story they’d like to repeat later to their children.

Morning found them wringing the city out of their clothes, packing the jars and the blanket and the Kitchen Shell’s blueprint written on nothing anyone would recognize as paper. The safety officer, that careful man, came to shake hands in a way that surprised everyone including him. He said that in a place constructed to bully noise into work, he had watched people coax it into kindness, and this had made him consider revising several opinions. He asked for absolutely nothing and was given a jar of honey from an airport duty-free that was not adequate as a gift and would still be eaten by a person with a sweet tooth, which he refused to admit to and then admitted to at once.

They crossed the city in a taxi driven by a man who had once built a stage inside a synagogue and now suffered only minorly from nostalgia. He spoke about wood with a reverence the professor understood down to the bone and told them that if they ever came back he would show them a door that sang when nobody’s hands were on it. Ilka asked for the address like a thief planning a loving crime and he wrote it down on the back of a receipt for bananas with ridiculous gravity. The river accompanied them to the edge of the airport and then, jealous of flight, pretended to lose interest completely.

Security permitted the jars with less ceremony this time, either because of a note on a screen the agent did not pretend not to see or because the jars had learned to project innocence. The scarf, folded into a shape that was very nearly devotional and entirely practical, fit into Réka’s bag with room to spare for the piece of paper on which she had written badly as a child and again last night, these two handwritings negotiating their hierarchy in the dark. On board, the plane gave them the perfumed democracy of economy seats and the pilot gave them his confidence, and the sky gave them a view of England that might have been a strategy but was only weather obeying its own contract.

They were almost home when the professor put his hand flat over his chest and laughed quietly, not at a joke but at the accuracy of a long-ago doctor. “I am learning to move it,” he said without preface, and the women understood him without asking him to say the rest of the grammar. He did not mean his hands. He did not mean the jars. He did not even mean the building that had harmonized when coaxed. He meant the thing unnamed that had sat in him for years like a politely furious tenant. He meant his voice, the one given to him before he had instruments and rhetoric and chalk.

Back in the courtyard, the cucumber vines had finished deciding and were now simply ornaments making their peace with necessary endings. The fig had saved a few fruits in a selfish pocket of branches and delivered them one by one the way miserly men give away change. Bogyó took control of the luggage in the sense that he smelled it with procedural accuracy and announced nothing dangerous, then took control of the couch with actual authority and invited Galileo to examine a zipper. The jar with the hairline crack went on the windowsill like a veteran back from a decent war, and the scarf took its place where it had always intended to be, over the chair that had inherited gravitas by being sat in repeatedly by a man who thinks slowly.

They waited two days to call the nephew because grief deserves not to be scheduled and then they called anyway because absence demands its respect too. He told them the cake would have made his aunt snort and then eat seconds, and he told them the broadcast made three women in the village claim they had trained Réka themselves, and he told them the doctor had said something about sound traveling after we stop and then had been too embarrassed to finish his thought with witnesses. They promised to come before winter hardened its law. He said the bridge had held that week under an unusual number of people and that someone had painted its rails blue for reasons nobody needed to solve.

On the third morning, the market hall received them as if nothing had happened, and that is how you know you are allowed to be real somewhere. The paprika woman lifted her knife as if to salute and then resumed her methodical weather. The fish argued with the air as is their custom. The professor stood under the iron ribs and asked the echo to kindly show him its hands. The twins, back from school with the kind of knowledge that sticks to children and repels adults, reported improvements to the Kitchen Shell that involved a string, a spoon, and a superstition they refused to disclose. Ilka had a stack of envelopes and that look of joy she gets when paperwork is a riddle she can translate into cake.

They rehearsed without speech because the courtyard and the hall and the kitchen had taught them it was possible. The counting song grew its winter coat and did not mind. The lullaby knew where to sit when guests came by. The scarf retained a ghost of coal and a ghost of wind and these ghosts learned to share. The professor, in a moment of rash honesty, told the courtyard that he had never loved an equation more than he loved a correctly placed blanket. Nobody laughed because the blanket had been listening.

Evenings became the inventory of the sort of abundance you cannot persuade a ledger to register. There were bowls of stew eaten without apology. There were lines written in pencil that got smudged by cups sweating in summer’s leftovers. There were commitments made to refuse certain kinds of contracts and to sign others if the money behaved itself and the clauses did not require them to impersonate polite pseudonyms for hunger. There were thin letters from former students of the professor who had discovered, on witnessing a broadcast at a great remove, that their old teacher had been hiding a second subject in every lecture and had finally been found out.

When the weather shifted decisively and old women wrapped their heads with the intent of succeeding at winter again, they took the train to the village as they had promised. The apples on the platform looked surprised the way apples do when you remember them, and the boy who had announced their arrival last time had grown in ways that make you want to forbid time and then accept its stern genius. The peppers under the eaves had gone into jars or mouths; the white walls held their breath politely.

They sat at the table and played the broadcast on a device that looked so unheroic it became noble. Sára was there in silk and not in silk, in a scarf and also in a jar, and the nephew cried the way men cry when the thing that broke did not shatter. When it was over, the neighbor came to the door to borrow an onion and found a room full of people pretending onions were the reason to gather and then took an onion and refused to leave until someone told her where to set her tears. They ate cake that had learned a British trick and had forgiven itself for being foreign. The professor stood in the doorway listening to the courtyard listen to the device, and he muttered thank yous in the direction of the floorboards as if houses require manners when they make room for the dead.

Snow announced itself by practicing on roofs without telling streets. When they left that night, a flake landed on the cracked jar’s twin and sang a note only the professor pretended to be unable to hear. He put his hand on the open air where a lid would have been and held it there, as if steadying the season for the sake of everyone present. On the way back, the train stalled between stations for a minute that pretended to be long and offered the kind of view that makes you think you understand your country: flat, then not; horizon holding its own counsel; a line of trees like punctuation; and above, a sky that seemed to be choosing its next word with care.

It was nearly midnight when they walked up their lane and the fig tree made the noise it makes in winter, which is no noise at all and somehow still an argument. The professor paused under the lintel and looked at the chair and the scarf and the jar and at the two women who would never leave him to resign to the sky alone, and he did the ridiculous thing at last in a way that made it into its opposite. He stood very straight and saluted the room, not with irony and not with an army, but with an old man’s simple treason against his own hopelessness. He saluted quietly, the way people do when they are alone in the right company, and then he put the kettle on because, in the world they had made between them, this was the most complicated ceremony permitted.
