The first time I realize my laugh is a kind of armor is on a Wednesday night at the Coffee Depot in Warren, a room that smells like espresso and old coats, where the audience is half comics waiting to go up and half couples who thought they were going to a poetry reading and are too polite to leave. I’m onstage with a mic that crackles every time my mouth moves too close. I talk about potholes so deep they have their own microclimates, dating apps that keep telling me my soulmate is someone I went to middle school with, how Providence isn’t a small town so much as a hallway where everyone knows what everyone else is doing and who they were before they started doing it.

No one laughs at the hallway line. I laugh at it myself, and they laugh at that. This is the secret you learn after a dozen rooms: if your mouth can sound like you are letting them in on your failure, like you are the first to notice you’re falling, they will hold you up out of sheer kindness. Or because they want to watch you try again. My mouth is my parachute and my trap, both.

After my set, the emcee leans in and says, “Good stuff, Heather. That hallway bit—maybe put a beat before it?” He means, pause and let them catch up. He means, be a little less hungry.

“Thanks,” I say, and I mean it. My jacket sleeves are damp from something that got spilled on the back of my chair. I have a second drink I don’t remember ordering. I text my mother that I’ll be at the house on Friday early because if we’re going to do this, if we’re going to pretend we’re all a family with matching blood types, then someone needs to bring the cake, and it’s always me.

My mother is marrying Frank O’Keefe in two weeks in a backyard with a rented tent and a DJ who owes him a favor. It’s a late marriage—my mother is fifty-eight, cruel in her friendliness, sharp as a lemon. She manages a dental office where she makes regular people feel like royalty and royalty feel like they need to floss better. Frank is sixty-one and soft around the middle and kind in a way that makes you suspicious until you realize that’s just how some people are. He sells boat insurance to people who lie about how far they’re taking their boats.

He has a daughter, grown, named June. I met her once when I was eighteen and she was nineteen, in a hospital waiting room where nobody was dying but it felt like we were practicing for when someone would. My mother had a sprained wrist from slipping on the steps behind our triple-decker in Federal Hill, and Frank brought June because he had afternoon custody, like she was still a signed-out library book even though she was already private property: July tan, nail beds bitten down, freckles like she’d been lightly salted. We were both holding plastic cups of deeply suspicious water. She said, “I like your hair,” like she was apologizing for something else entirely. I said, “Thanks,” and then the TV above us showed a commercial for a local lawyer with a gold tie and a perpetual jawline who promised justice and low rates, and we both laughed, which is the kind of laugh that makes two people belong to something for three seconds and then it disappears and you forget to write down the name of the thing.

Later I would hear from my mother, in the breathless tone she uses for news she knows is none of my business but also the only news that exists in the world, that June moved away for a while, that she came back, that she’s “finding herself” in the way people say when they are lost and doing it interestingly. June became a para at an elementary school in Pawtucket, which makes her a person who knows how to tie shoes and break up fights and talk a child into taking their meds by pretending the pills are tiny moons. I do not see her for years and when I think of her there is no reason to, except there is this tiny click inside me, like a lock testing itself.

Friday morning I roll out of bed with my hair pretending to be several people and a cough I earned from the dusty HVAC at the Comedy Connection last night. My apartment is on the second floor of a house in Olneyville that used to be purple, used to be a tattoo shop, used to be a two-family before someone decided they could get more rent by pretending it was three. My window looks over a parking lot that looks over a fence that looks over another parking lot. When it rains, the lot collects water in one corner and I pretend it’s a pond. The neighbors name it. Today it’s called Swan Lake, because a plastic swan someone bought at Benny’s and then never took home has drifted into the depression. Lights turn on in the mill building across the alley, bright rectangles stacked like very careful pancakes.

I drive to my mother’s in a car that was my aunt’s, then my cousin’s, then mine. The passenger seat seatbelt light blips on and off like Morse code for you are alone, but are you? It’s early enough that 95 hasn’t become the conveyor belt it turns into by nine. I have a cake in the back in a white box with a gold string that makes it look fancier than it is. It’s from a bakery in Cranston where the women behind the counter call everyone “hon” and look at you like they know too much about your life before you say anything. They’re not wrong. In Rhode Island, either someone knows your business or you’ve done it wrong.

I catch the skyline for a second in my rearview—the Superman Building like a stubborn tooth, the weird red cone over the old bridge like a party hat on a parent. It’s a day with a thin sort of sunlight, streamers of cloud. I think about what I’m going to say on Saturday when I have to do my toast. Jokes about boat insurance. Jokes about how my mother was always going to marry someone who knew what to do with rope and a knot. Jokes that are a little too much about drowning.

At the house, my mother is already shouting hello before I get the front door open, because she is that kind of hello person. Frank waves from the kitchen where he is reading the newspaper like it is his long-term partner and he never has to look anywhere else. On the counter: a bowl of dark cherries, a package of paper plates that say Happily Ever After in a font too curly for any serious event.

“Heather,” my mother says, “you look pale. Are you pale? Eat a cherry. Frank, tell her she’s pale.”

“You’re beige,” Frank says, which I think is sweet.

June is on the deck. I don’t know she’s there until I walk into the kitchen and glance out and see a shape I think I might have dreamed of. She’s looking at the yard like it’s a thing you can solve if you get quiet enough. It’s a lot I recognize—that old lilac, that terra-cotta frog with a missing eye, the grill that finally got replaced after it threatened to explode twice. June is cross-legged on the wooden step and her hair is darker than I remember and longer, a stallion’s mane, a curtain at a theater where something just ended. She’s wearing a gray sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up and a pair of shorts that say RIVER DAY in cracking navy letters. When she sees me, her face changes in a way I wish faces didn’t. It goes from faraway to here-you-are. It goes warm.

“Heather,” she says, and I learn my name’s other shape.

“You look the same,” I say, which is not true. The eighteen-year-old I saw in the ER would have bolted if she saw this version of herself. This one sits still like a trained deer.

“You don’t,” she says. “In a good way. Like you figured out you have eyebrows.”

“Profession: comedian,” I say, making a ta-da with my hands. “I get paid in drink tickets and advice about my eyebrows.”

“Oh, I know,” she says, and there is a way people know things in New England that isn’t about privacy. It’s about proximity, about having known your aunt in high school and your ex in the dairy aisle and your report card in the flood that wiped out the basement. “I’ve seen your videos.” She holds up her phone. “You got heckled by a guy in a Patriots jersey who looked like a potato that could drive.”

“That was Cousin Rick,” I say. “We had to invite him. The union rules.”

She laughs, which gets inside my ribs like it’s always lived there, just didn't know the floor plan. It’s a dumb thing, the way laughter clicks into place between two people. It’s not proof. It’s not a map. It’s just a noise you make, and then sometimes you can’t unhear it for days.

We sit on the steps and eat cherries and spit the pits into a paper cup with a flower pattern. She tells me about little kids who will be something if anyone lets them, and about a TA who brings her father’s lunch his whole shift because he works maintenance at the school and forgets to eat otherwise. I tell her about audiences that think they want dark until you give it to them, about a woman in a cardigan who told me after a show that I should never say the word vagina onstage because she could hear it in the next room and that’s not what she came out for. Noted.

“You ever missed,” June asks, “and thought, this time I won’t come back from it?”

“All the time,” I say. “You?”

“All the time,” she says, and then we’re looking at the lilac in a silence that isn’t a bad one. I hear the traffic even here, the constant hush of a highway like the ocean if you didn’t know better. A cicada starts and stops like it lost its line.

My mother slides the screen door open with an authoritative clatter and says, “No one is sitting on my steps flirting like teenagers. Come inside and be useful,” and June blushes, and I laugh and then stop laughing midway and June sees that and I see that she sees it, which is too much seeing for a Friday.

Inside, I cut the cake and we put it on plates and my mother delegates; she is a general of laminated lists. June rinses cherries in the sink and lets them fall back in their bowl like jewels. Frank hums to the radio like it is a person who needs encouragement. After a while, when the kitchen heat makes me feel like my skin is wearing another skin, I say I have an appointment and June says she has to go too, and we leave at the same time, and because this is Rhode Island we are parked three cars apart.

She walks with me to my beat-up Corolla. “You going to do your toast?” she asks. “Like a set?”

“I was thinking something respectful,” I say, like I might know what that is. “Five minutes, tight, mostly about my mother’s jawline.”

“Her jawline is terrifying,” June says. “Mine is, like, not approved by any boards.”

I want to put my hand on her jaw like it’s a bird that landed wrong. I don’t. “Yours is fine,” I say. “’Fine’ is more than.”

“We should hang soon.” She says it like she’s not afraid I’ll say no, which means she is very brave or very sure, and I’m not sure which one it is.

“I have a show at AS220 tomorrow night,” I say. “It’s not a show, it’s a thing where we pretend it’s a show. But we could get a drink after. If you want. No pressure.”

“I love pressure,” she says, and grins, and then she gets into her car, which is one of those boxy ones that look like they’re sponsored by vitamins. There’s a police scanner in the cup holder. A fluorescent vest for crossing duty thrown over the back seat. I try to picture her out there in front of cars with her hand up. I imagine her being the only reason anyone pauses.

We do get a drink the next night after the not-a-show. I’m loose and raw, new bit still bleeding. When I say a joke about how every Rhode Island distills to a family argument and a pie, a guy in the back goes, “Hey, leave my mother out of this,” and I say, “She’s already in it, you just can’t see her,” and the room shakes a little and afterward I am shaky too. June meets me by the door and hands me a bottle of water like I am someone she is used to caring for.

At the bar across the street, we sit too close because we are working with what the stools give us. The bartender is a woman with a shaved head and a lip piercing who calls us ladies in a way that doesn’t feel like a trap. June orders something with pineapple and maraschino cherries. I order whiskey like that makes me any different. We chew on these fluorescent fruits and I ask her, because I want to know, “Are you seeing anyone?”

She snorts like I told a joke and flicks a cherry stem onto a napkin. “I was. We weren’t. He had this way of making me a problem he could fix. There’s an entire aisle in the hardware store for that type.”

“I’ve dated the aisle,” I say.

“What about you?”

“I date failure,” I say too quickly and then correct. “I date comics, which is the same thing. I date me and then get mad when I don’t call.”

“You should call you,” she says, like she means it. Her left knee touches my right knee and neither of us move away. The bar’s song changes to something eighties and earnest. We talk about nothing with the intensity of people who are outspeaking the thing behind their teeth. I remember to ask her about her mother, and June says, “My mother is in Worcester with a man who collects snow globes. It’s fine. He is kind to her when she lets him be.” I nod like kindness is ubiquitous, a Walmart of a trait you can just get.

At midnight, the bartender flips something invisible and the lights look like they care less. June says she should drive home and I say I could drive her but that doesn’t make sense because our cars are here and my apartment is over there. We stand on the sidewalk under the motel blue of the streetlights and then we do the thing where people who are not supposed to do something stare at each other like if they look long enough someone else will announce what it is. She takes my hand like we already invented this. It’s the summer air that makes everything smell like a beginning. It’s the fact that we are both grown enough to have keys, to know what we want and how we don’t.

“I can’t,” she says, and then, “I mean not here.”

“Okay,” I say, and I can feel the inside of my ribs again, all that scaffolding. “Another time.”

“I’ll text you,” she says, and then she does something that will stop my heart for two weeks in a very inconvenient way: she kisses the top of my hand like we are in a book where people wear hats. It is so formal it almost erases the wanting, and then it does not erase it at all. There are other mouths. Other parts that might arrive later, like late trains.

We do the dance of texting the next few days, the choreography of an almost: good morning with a photo of the crossing guard vest folded on a chair, a lunch break picture of a ham sandwich cut into triangles, a voice memo from me doing a piece of a joke and her voice laughing and saying, “You’re mean,” like it’s a compliment she invented. My mother calls to ask if I can pick up extra forks and I say yes and then she says, carefully, like she’s balancing a cake on a bicycle, “Don’t hurt June,” and I say, “Who says I could,” and she says, “Everyone hurts everyone. It’s not religion, but it is a practice.”

The wedding happens under a sky that looks like a ceiling you would repaint if you owned the place. The tent flaps like a slow heart. There are sticky children and their tired parents and a cousin who has new teeth you can see from two tables away and a cooler with beers that keep disappearing and reappearing as if by magic. We are all dressed like brand-new versions of ourselves. My mother’s dress is a swift white. Frank’s tie is the exact color of a navy sky three minutes after sunset. June is in a green dress that would be illegal if fabric were a law.

When the DJ starts Hava Nagila because he does this at every wedding because someone will always want it, my mother is up with a chair under her, waving her napkin like surrender. The quahogs are tender. The cake has too much frosting and everyone leaves with their lips sugar-sticky. In my toast I say, “My mother has always known what to do with pain. She names it, and then she tells it to go sit down. Frank knows how to be quiet in a room without being absent, which is a miracle and a skill. Together they are the tide and the shore. Every day they’ll arrive, they’ll recede, and neither of them is going anywhere.” I think that is too much and then people clap like they did not feel the undertow. June smiles at me across the clatter and I take a breath the way you do before diving.

There are photos afterward. An aunt with her hand on my shoulder. The clink of ice in glasses. The smell of lawn and citronella and perfume I don’t know the name of. June and I end up under the maple tree behind the tent where someone is smoking and pretending not to be. Her hand finds the small of my back like it’s always known the address. We’re talking about how my mother stole her first pair of earrings by charming the clerk into putting them in the wrong box; about Frank telling the story of the time he got lost in the fog off Block Island and just trusted his engine to keep sounding like a heartbeat. And then she says, abruptly, “There’s something wrong with me.”

I blink. “Like, in general?” This is my professional instinct. Diminish the horror. Make it bite-size.

“No, I mean, I get this thing,” she says. “I get—when I’m in my car sometimes, I think I could turn the wheel and it would all stop. It’s not an impulse, I don’t want to do it, it’s like a thought that crawled in and won’t leave.” Her eyes are on my shoulder, like she could hide in the muscle if she wanted.

“That’s just the worst part of your brain playing charades,” I say. “It’s just a thought. You know that.”

“I know,” she says, but her hand is cold. “It’s not always bad. I still do what I have to do. Sometimes it feels like—like if I can keep everyone else okay, it’s a kind of shield. Like if the kid with the peanut allergy lives through snack time, then I get to be alive too.”

“June,” I say, because there is a whole prayer inside her name and I don’t know any other prayer. I don’t tell her the thing I don’t tell anyone: that sometimes when I’m onstage and they’re with me and it’s like I unlocked a door with the wrong key and it still opened, I think I could just walk out of my life afterward and no one would do anything but clap. I don’t say it because this is not the moment for me, because I am greedy in every other part of my life and I have to choose this time not to be.

“Drive with me,” she says. “Not now. Another day. Sit with me, and if it happens, if the thought happens, you can say something stupid, and we’ll laugh, and then it’ll just be a thought again.” She says this fast like if she says it slowly I’ll see the seams.

“Yes,” I say. “I’ll say something very stupid. I have a license in it.”

“I know,” she says, and puts her forehead against mine like we can make a new roof. The DJ puts on something from the nineties that makes the older people look helpless and the younger ones roll their eyes, and it’s perfect and ugly and real.

After, it’s all movement. It’s cleaning up. It’s my mother putting extra cake into wide mouths and June standing in the driveway with a lighter trying to get a sparkler to admit what it is. It’s the dark moving in fast like a choice you didn’t make.

We don’t drive together after that for a while. We get busy with summer, with the acts of small rescue that make up a life. June texts me photos of a kid’s art project—a collage that looks like outer space was cut into squares. I text her a video of a woman on Atwells Avenue screaming at a pigeon in a way that made the pigeon look embarrassed. We meet in the afternoons where the light feels thick and we volunteer for two hours at the food bank packing boxes and making sure the cans are the right way up. We don’t say we are together, because it is tricky; because there are our parents; because families are Jenga towers made of three sets of hands. And also maybe we don’t say it because if we do we will have to hold it up with our words.

One Tuesday when the air is mush and the city looks like it’s been breathed on, we end up in my car after a late lunch at a diner where the waitresses call you sweetie in a tone that could cut glass. She has marks on her wrist from too many bracelets. I have a grease stain from the burger I eat when I tell myself I did good enough this week to deserve something that could put me in a slow coma. We don’t have anywhere to be; it’s rare and it feels illegal.

“Let’s go nowhere,” she says. “Let’s go everywhere.” She has that look she gets when the world edges in and she is stronger than it, most days, and it knows.

We drive up Blackstone Boulevard, where runners pass like they are counting their breaths. We pass old houses with porches you could have arguments on for decades. We pass a man trimming a hedge like he’s getting it ready for a wedding. We turn onto Hope Street because of the name. I am narrating the ridiculousness of the stop signs that appear and disappear like those birds in cartoons. She is quiet in a way that means she is trying to turn down the volume in her head.

At a red light she finally says, “It’s here,” and I know what she means. “Say something stupid.”

“Zucchini,” I say, and she bursts out laughing so hard it startles a woman on the sidewalk who is walking two small dogs in little shoes. “Banana hammock,” I add, because once you start you have to go all in. “Rhode Island isn’t even an island, it’s a state of mind.”

She is gasping now, the wheel steady under her hands. The light turns green. The light winks away. We go forward and we keep going and there’s a sweetness to the motion that makes me want to weep. It feels like a reprieve. It feels like the universe saying, not yet.

We park in front of India Point and watch the river try to decide if it’s a mirror. A man brings out a small grill and puts hot dogs on it because he is that man and I love him. We sit on the hood and talk about the lives we didn’t lead: the one where I moved to New York and learned to love a rat; the one where she stayed in Maine with the girl who wore boots year-round and called her baby for two years and then called her nothing for the next two. The trees move like they are trying to remember a dance from an old show.

“This is so easy,” I say, and then immediately regret it, because names are like levers, and I might have pulled one I cannot push back.

“It is,” she says anyway. “It won’t be, but it is.”

“What will we do with them?” I ask, picturing my mother and Frank like two saints in a stained glass window, lit from outside, watched from within. It is so arrogant to imagine we can hurt people with our existence. It is also true.

“Tell them the truth,” she says, looking at me and not at the water. “I don’t know. I have never been anyone’s disappointment politely.” She puts her head on my shoulder. “Maybe we can just be careful. We could be generous.”

“That’s not how people remember things,” I say. “They remember who told them first and who laughed at the wrong time.”

“Okay,” she says. “Let’s do the right thing for the wrong reasons, or the wrong thing for the right reasons. As long as we’re together when we do it.”

I want to kiss her, but there is a father and a toddler nearby feeding invisible ducks, and the air is full of five o’clock. We get back in the car. The radio can’t decide on a station. It all flickers. She drives us home, first to her place—a third-floor walk-up in Pawtucket with windowsills full of plants trying hard—and then she walks me down the three flights because we are something and we are not yet saying it out loud.

At night my apartment becomes a ship. The neighbors creak in their hull. The Swan Lake puddle gathers reflections. I take my phone to bed because I am a cliché who may die without it. There is a message from June: Just in case you forget, zucchini. I make a voice memo back: Traffic cone. Granite. Candlepin bowling. She sends a photo of her foot with a Band-Aid on the heel and says, New shoes are liars. I write back, People are too. Then, before I can decide to be cleverer, I add: I want you, which looks worse on a screen than it does in the air, but it’s true, and I am thirty, and there is room in my mouth for the thing.

There is a long minute. Then: Me too. There is a smaller minute. Then: Come over.

I do. I bring nothing because what would I bring. I drive carefully because suddenly everything is breakable. Her building smells like onions and dust; the stairwell light is always on. She opens the door before I knock like she knew the sound. We kiss in the thin entryway like we are trying not to wake the sleeping coats. The couch is an old thing that complains in every language. Her mouth is new. Her hands learn. Mine do, too. There is a song playing somewhere that comes through the vent and it’s somebody else’s heartbreak with a tempo too fast. We go slow. We do not talk. At one point we laugh because her cat jumps on the counter and knocks off a cup and is so proud of it that there is nothing else to do.

After, she sleeps with one arm thrown over her head like that’s how her dreams start. I lie awake like an idiot and count backwards from a hundred and picture a tightrope at the zoo and all the things people say to calm down, and none of it does, because calm isn’t a trick and it isn’t a job. It’s something you get with time or not at all. Later, when I remember this night, my throat hurts. Later, when I try to write about it, the bit never works, because there is no punchline; it is only open.

The next morning she is up early, because kids wait for nobody. I go with her, because she asks, because it is a Saturday and there is a potluck at the playground and she needs an extra pair of hands. We carry deviled eggs and napkins and something called walking tacos that are just chips with scoops of other food inside them. There are little humans everywhere. They have faces that are too big for their heads. A boy with a gap where a tooth will be tells me my shoes are “tragic” and I say, “I know,” and we are friends immediately. June’s face changes with every kid she looks at. Her mouth does a lot of parenting all by itself.

On the way home, I drive us along Broad Street because I like the old theaters and the way you can buy a rainbow on any corner. A man on a bike rides like he’s going to win something that nobody knew was a race. The air smells like meat on a grill and sugar. We talk about clouds, because anything else feels dangerous in the sun.

“Promise me something,” June says, suddenly at a red light. We are always at a red light when we say the most important things. It’s a city rule. “Promise me you’ll never leave when I can’t find words.”

“I won’t,” I say, because I am good at promises, especially the kind that require staying in the room. Later, I am bad at other kinds. We smile at each other like a light got turned on inside a drawer.

I do not know, then, the sound tires make on bone. I do not know how loud it gets when your life chooses a different tune. I do not know the name of a woman with thin wrists and a shopping bag who plays bingo on Thursdays and eats a citrus fruit every morning in the light of her kitchen and belongs to the Intangible. There are so many people we don’t know we know. There are so many cars. There is so much of everything, and all of it waits. Nobody warns you how many ordinary hours a life can hold before the hour that changes what you mean when you say your own name. I drive June home and we kiss in the foyer like the air is on our side. I go back to my apartment. I sleep like a person who thinks in lines. It is summer. The river is pretending to be a mirror again. Somewhere, a woman picks up her bingo card and her keys. Somewhere else, June is setting her alarm for the morning and placing her phone face down on a book about how to grow basil in small spaces. The world has such a casual way of setting the stage. I would like to tell it: we are not ready. I would like to tell it: we are never. I would like to ask for one more June afternoon with the word zucchini in it like a rope tied to the correct post. But the light is going. The room clicks with it. The last thing I hear is the little metallic sigh my fridge makes when it restarts, which, if you’re tired enough, sounds like a friend.The next morning I wake to sunlight acting like it owns the place and a text from June that just says, Morning, which is a whole thesis if you open it carefully. I lie there and inventory the sounds like I do when I want to keep loving the world: the upstairs neighbor’s treadmill that sighs like it’s been sentenced to rehabilitation, the far-off freight train through Olneyville that sounds like a soloist clearing their throat, the trash truck hydraulics praying. There’s a little dirt under my fingernail from where I pressed my hands into the edge of June’s counter when her cat decided to try parkour above the sink at two a.m., and there’s a bruise on my thigh from the arm of her couch where the springs make their opinions known. These are small proofs that what happened happened, and I gather them in like raffle tickets that might be for a prize I could stand to keep.

I text back a photo of the puddle, newly christened by the neighbors in chalk on the asphalt as The Narragansett Miniverse, the plastic swan now with a lei someone has put around its neck like this is a multiverse where all swans attend tropical weddings. June sends me a voice memo humming a song I can’t place until three hours later when it comes on at the bodega and I exclaim too loudly in front of the gum rack. The woman at the register says, “You good?” in a way that is not unkind and I say, “My head is playing old radio,” and she nods like that’s a diagnosis she’s familiar with.

My mother calls to ask whether I am coming by to help with the return of the chairs that weren’t picked up because the rental company apparently operates on a clock that is lunar and divorced from municipal time. I say yes because if I say no she will tell me that she will do it herself and then text me photos of her doing it with captions like, “Your mother is a beast of burden,” which is her version of poetry. At the house, the tent is already down and looks deflated and embarrassed like a giant who got drunk and slept in the yard. Frank is in a good mood that translates to him calling me “kiddo” and not noticing when I move the heavy stack by myself because he’s arguing with a guy on speakerphone about whether a skiff is a boat if it cannot hold your sadness. June is not there because she is leading a summer reading thing at the library where she gives children stickers for sounding out words like they are made of glass.

We load chair after chair like this family is going to keep sitting for the rest of our lives. My mother supervises with a clipboard and a pen she keeps flicking like a tic. She brings me a bottle of water and says, too casual, “How are you and June?” and I pretend to misunderstand first because that gives me an extra second to rehearse a half-truth. I say, “She’s good. Busy. Kind of a hero,” and my mother says, “We’re not jealous of heroes, we wait for them to come home,” which is either something she read on a dish towel or something she invented in a hallway when no one else was there. I tell her I’m thinking of doing an open mic in Boston next week and she says, “You’ll get murdered,” in the same tone she uses when advising me not to buy lettuce from anyone named Bob.

By Wednesday the heat has the city by its wrists. June and I go to a matinee to hide inside somebody else’s air conditioning. The movie is about two people who pretend to hate each other because that’s how they learned to confess, and halfway through my popcorn tastes like salt and plastic grief. June lays her arm along the seat so our pinkies touch, and it feels like a civic ceremony. After, we get ice cream with sprinkles that look like confetti at a small parade. A kid with a chin like a peanut asks June if she is famous and she says, “No, I just carry big keys,” and he nods because that qualifies. In the car after, while the AC tries and fails to be a miracle, June says, “I haven’t told him,” and I know she means Frank, and I know she also means she wants me to wait for her to want to tell him, and I say, “We have time,” because that seems like a kind lie with a good chance at passing for truth for a little while.

Thursday arrives like a cousin with a casserole and no sense of boundaries. It is the kind of day where your sweat has opinions and the asphalt shines like something you could fall through if you don’t look brave. I do laundry at the laundromat where the machines have names written on them in Sharpie—there’s a Gloria that works like a saint and a Keith that will eat your quarters and look you in the eye—and I listen to a man in a shirt that says KING OF GRILLING talk on his phone about how his sister is “not wrong, but she’s not right either.” There’s a TV mounted in the corner that shows a local news segment about a missing person who isn’t missing anymore because they came home when the air turned, and I feel like that is a script somebody keeps on a thumb drive for summer.

I have a set that night at a brewery that used to be a factory and still smells like oil under the citrus. June can’t come because she has a meeting at school about a student with a diagnosis with too many letters, and she texts me a photo of a whiteboard with “PBIS” written on it in bubble letters, and I text back a photo of my beer with a slice of grapefruit in it, and then the bartender, who wears very short shorts and very long socks, says, “When did we decide to put salads in drinks?” and we are briefly friends. Onstage, I do a bit about how you know you’re from Rhode Island because you can measure time in rotaries, and then I talk about my mother teaching me to tell people what I want in a tone that sounds like I don’t need it, and they laugh because they either recognize the tone or want to. Someone coughs like their chest is trying to say their name. A couple near the front holds hands like they invented it.

After the show, I wish with the whole stupid feathered thing in my chest that June were there to pass me a water bottle and a look that makes me remember to breathe. Instead I sit on the curb behind the brewery and watch a cat with one ear climb a chain-link fence like it is a problem set, and I call June and it goes to voicemail. I leave a message I think is clever and probably is not, and then I go home the long way like I always do when I think if I keep the route loose I can trick fate into missing me.

At nine fifty-eight my phone lights with June: Can you come get me. There is a map pin and a string of extra letters like she hit the keyboard with the side of her hand. I am in my pajamas which means a t-shirt from a road race I did not run and shorts that say some college I did not attend, and I am out the door before the fridge can sigh again. The map pin is on Broad near St. Teresa’s where the stoplight is always on its own spiritual journey and never matches what the pedestrians intend. I drive with both hands like a driving instructor is in the passenger seat grading me on my ability to want to keep breathing.

Broad is a ribbon of life even at ten, and it is a particular kind of life with people in white sneakers and gold hoops and families with three grocery bags apiece and music floating out of cars like ghosts with hips. I see the flash first—blue and red making a new color that hurts—and then the cluster of people who have formed a circle the way people do when something is not entertainment but cannot be looked away from. I see June because I know her even when she becomes a silhouette that has lost its edges. She is off to the side, her hands on the top of her head in that universal posture that says I am trying to keep something inside from spilling out, and a cop with a face like a closed door is speaking to her, his hand held away from his belt like restraint. There is a woman on the asphalt, small the way a person becomes when they are the center of a story they did not write, and two EMTs doing the careful urgent thing with the efficient tenderness that makes you want to sit down and cry later in a McDonald’s. There is a shopping bag spilled open like a mouth, oranges and a bingo card and a small jar of marmalade rolling slow like they are thinking about it.

I park badly and leave the car door open because it seems like a day for leaving things ajar. I walk toward June like I have a right to, and the cop steps into my path with that bureaucratic grace that says he was the crossing guard of his own childhood. I say, “I’m her—” and stop because my mouth knows the word it should use and my brain is still in committee. I say, “I’m here,” and the cop looks at June and June nods and then he lets me through like a toll taker and I am next to her and I don’t touch her because her arms are up and I don’t know the ritual yet. She looks at me like I’m the sign with the words she forgot.

“I didn’t see her,” she says, and it is like a line from a movie I would never watch again. “Heather, I swear to God, I didn’t see her. The light—I was turning and the guy behind me honked like I was going to ruin his year and I looked and I didn’t look there and she was just—” Her voice is either too loud or too soft; it changes between words like it’s trying on volumes at a store with bad mirrors.

I say the first thing my brain sends up from the office where it makes bad decisions: “Zucchini,” and she lets out a sound that is half laugh, half keening, and I want to smash my mouth because the word feels obscene here, like naming a toy in a church. I say, “I’m here,” which is the only true thing I have, and I put my hand on the small of her back in that place her body made for me without knowing, and I can feel her shaking like an engine that doesn’t want to quit.

The EMTs are talking in a language that is English but is also medical and careful: pulse, responsive, pupils, hold pressure. The woman on the ground has gray hair braided like a crown and a face like a coastline and a dress with blue flowers that are too cheerful for asphalt. There is a young guy who keeps saying, “She just stepped out, she didn’t even look,” and a woman holding a baby who says, “Shut up, Kevin,” because she knows or because his voice sounds like a judge. The driver of the car behind June keeps shaking his head like that will rearrange the facts, and I look at him and I want to hurt something in a way that startles me because my anger usually comes out in jokes and not as a spear. A man with a Celtics cap asks no one if anyone called her family, and there is a chorus of voices pointing at the EMTs and the woman on a phone and the cop’s notepad like this is a chorus that knows its harmonies.

They put the woman on a backboard and I am carried back to the hospital waiting room where I first learned June’s name. The gurney’s wheels squeak in a rhythm that writes a sentence I cannot read. The ambulance doors close with that professional tenderness. June sags like a structure that held more than it should and I finally take her hand because hers is reaching for mine with the blind accuracy of a plant turning toward whatever light it can find. The cop asks for her license and registration and insurance, and she gives him everything uncomplaining because she has been practicing compliance since she was born. He asks if she had anything to drink, and she says no, and he looks at me like I might vouch for her blood, and I say, “We had ice cream,” because my mouth does not know grief from evidence.

Another cop, a woman with hair pulled back so tight it could fling her into the sun, says gently, “Do you want someone you know to be here?” and June looks at me like I am a riddle and then says, “My father,” and the cop says, “Do you want me to call him?” and June says, “No, I will,” and then her mouth sits there, not moving, and I take her phone out of her bag like a bomb and I say, “I can,” and she nods and the cop watches like she is watching a ship dock in a storm. I step away into the yellow light of the pizza place storefront and call Frank, and he answers with, “We still need the chairs?” because he is in that part of the evening where a person thinks things will remain in their category, and I say, very carefully because I have learned that care sometimes keeps the ceiling from falling, “June was in an accident and she’s okay and someone else is hurt and we’re at Broad and Sutton and can you come,” and there is silence on the line that sounds like a person setting a heavy object on the floor gently. He says, “We’re on our way,” and I hear my mother in the background saying, “What,” and then I hear the movement that is jackets and keys and the way two people who have loved each other enough to make a ceremony out of it put their bodies into motion.

The ambulance leaves and the crowd rearranges itself; the stage directions have shifted. June sits on the curb with her chin in her hands and the cop who had been a door becomes a folding chair; he sits in a squat near her and speaks in that low register where you can lie and it still sounds like a lullaby. He says, “I’m going to have to ask you some questions,” and she nods and he does, and she answers and she cries and she apologizes to the air in between words like apologizing to the air might make the air different. I put my hand on her knee and take it off, put it on again like a Morse code for stay alive. The other cop starts directing traffic like she can conduct summer, and cars inch by and people look with that look that says they will either pray tonight or they will tell this story at work tomorrow with sound effects.

Frank arrives in a car that makes a noise like an old man clearing his throat. My mother is in the passenger seat in a dress she was not wearing twenty minutes ago which means she changed because she cannot present as chaos even to chaos. They map the scene in one second flat because they have the combined skill set of panic management and living where everything is close. Frank goes to June and his hand goes to the back of her head and he holds her to his chest like she is a boat he knows how to lash to the dock and he says her name like it’s a binding spell. My mother kneels and immediately starts triaging everything that does not need triaging because it is how she breathes; she says, “You haven’t eaten, you have to drink water, someone give me a tissue,” and then she looks at me and I see her see where my body is in relation to June’s, and I see the math happen behind her eyes, and her mouth does a small lurch like a boat encountering a wave it can ride.

There is a lot of time after that and none of it makes sense. Statements get taken. A witness in a purple tank top tells a version of events so certain you want to live inside it even if it makes your person the instrument of harm. The woman in the ambulance has a name and they tell us they will call when they can, and that is the kind of sentence that makes you invent a new version of patience. June goes with Frank to the station to sign more things and answer the same questions again and I go with my mother to her house where she makes tea like she can name it calm and we can drink it.

In the kitchen where we ate cherries three lifetimes ago, I sit at the table and I can hear the sound again and again, even though I did not hear it the first time because I was not there when it was made. My brain is a radio that finds the frequency anyway. My mother puts a hand on the top of my head like she is checking my temperature and she says, very quietly, “Is she all right?” and I say, “She will be if the story lets her,” and my mother nods like that is not entirely untrue. She pours milk into the tea and the milk makes cloud shapes and we both stare like we’re reading them. She says, “You were there,” and I say, “I got there after,” and she says, “You were there,” like the repetition might fix it. Then she puts both her hands flat on the table like she’s steadying it and says, “Heather,” and the way she says my name makes me stand up and go to the sink and look out at the dark yard because I cannot look at her face and at my life at the same time.

When Frank and June come back it is past midnight and all the clocks have given up on being right. June is pale in the mouth and she has that careful walk people have when they are carrying too much inside and don’t want to spill. Frank says, “They let her come home,” like he had a part in the decision, and June goes straight to the sink and runs the water and lets her hands sit under it as if she were draining a word she cannot say. My mother tries to hand her a towel; June ignores it and then sees it and dries one finger at a time like each one belongs to a different story. No one mentions the woman beyond the facts we were given; no one says her name yet because our tongues are not authorized. Then my mother, who cannot leave a thing half said, says, “You did not—” and stops because where can that sentence go that isn’t a cliff, and June says, “I hit her,” and sits down and the chair makes a sound like it is not okay with the weight of this either.

I sleep on my mother’s couch because it is ridiculous to go home and because I want to be nearby in case the air needs reinforcements. June sleeps barely at all in her old room with the nightlight her father keeps in the wall like a promise to the past. I lie and listen to the house make noises, old wood settling like a jury. Every time I shut my eyes I see the oranges rolling and the card face up with a grid of numbers waiting for someone to shout their luck. When I do sleep I dream we are driving and all the signs are in a language I knew yesterday and I cannot find the exit for anything that is not sorrow.

In the morning, there is news and it is not the worst, and therefore it is the kind that confuses you into thinking it is good. The woman is alive. The words are broken pelvis, broken wrist, concussion, overnight for observation, family notified. The adjectives are stable and resting, which are lies but useful ones. June cries into her cereal and then cannot remember if she has eaten and we all decide she has because the subject exhausted us. My mother says we should send flowers and then says we should bring them, and Frank says we should do whatever the family wants us to do and we should ask first because that is the rule and someone should tattoo it on their hand. He kisses June’s head in that rhythmic way people do when they are trying to reset the world and she leans into it like a person who knows where the soft place is.

We drive to the hospital because there are things you do and this is one. In the waiting room there is a different TV with a different commercial for a different lawyer, no gold tie this time, just a smile that says his jetski has a name. June sits with her hands inside the sleeves of her sweatshirt like she is returning to herself, and Frank goes to the desk with that face that gets what it wants because what it wants is minimal and reasonable. They say the woman’s daughter is with her, and that she is okay with June leaving a note if she keeps it short, and I think about what it means to be told to keep your apology short, how many words were wasted in the history of humans on the wrong length.

June writes with the tiny pen attached to the clipboard. She writes, I am so sorry. I did not see you. I will stand wherever you tell me to stand. She starts to write more and then stops and looks at me and I say, “Zucchini,” and she almost smiles, and I am grateful for the stupid little raft in the ocean we made out of a vegetable and a promise. Frank takes the note like it is a document to be filed in a safe and he gives it to the nurse who frowns at our clothes like grief should have a dress code. We sit for a while because movement feels like betrayal, and then June says she wants to go to work, and my mother says that is insane, and June says the kids are fragile and they handle my heart better than I do, and Frank says we will go with you and sit in the parking lot like patrons in a theater of your survival, and June rolls her eyes but she knows he means it and that he would watch her breathe if she let him.

At the school, which in summer looks like a building pretending to be a building, we sit in the car and the heat presses all its fingers to the glass. June goes inside with her vest like a flag, and I sit with Frank and my mother and we do not talk about the thing we are not talking about. After a while, my mother says, suddenly, “Are you two,” and then she does not finish and looks out the windshield where a rosemary bush is trying to grow through a chain link like ambition, and I could tell a joke to save us but I don’t. I say, “Yes,” and I do not look away because if I learned anything from my mother it is that looking while telling the truth is both the knife and the balm.

The silence is surprisingly gentle. Frank breathes in like a person about to jump off something short. He says, “Okay,” and then, “Okay,” again like he is trying it on and it fits. My mother makes a sound that is a laugh’s outline. She says, “Of course,” and then she says, “Oh, honey,” and her hand finds my knee the way mine found June’s at the curb and squeezes hard enough to leave a mark for later. She says, “I am not reasonable about many things, but I am about love. We will make adjustments,” and then she starts to cry because she is reasonable and unreasonable and this is neither, it is her kid’s happiness arriving with the exact wrong chaperone.

Frank says, softer than a tide, “I just don’t want anyone hurt,” and I say, “We don’t either,” and we all look at the school door like it might open and give us the schedule for the next year, which is a joke because all doors open into a hallway you didn’t build and there are no maps except the ones you make out of the words you promise in the heat.

When June comes out her face is a new kind of tired, the kind that happens when a person does their job while their brain is a room with a siren in it. She sees our faces and she knows, because we are all terrible at poker and she taught kindergarten once and reads truth in the way a person holds their shoulders. She stops in the sun and she breathes, and then she gets in the car and puts her hand on the console like it is a small altar, and she says, “Okay,” and we do not know which okay we are answering, but we all say it back like a chorus trying to learn a new song together without anyone keeping time.

For a few days we move through the world like it might break if we touch it wrong. June keeps her phone on loud in case someone tells her to come somewhere and be forgiven or punished; I keep mine on vibrate because there is only so much my brain can jump at once. The woman’s daughter calls to say her mother will be in rehab for a while and that she would like to meet June in a controlled, human place, maybe with coffee and no cars. We say yes, and the daughter gives us a time and a bakery whose coffee tastes like a memory and where the cookies are thick discs that make you feel provided for. My mother insists on baking something anyway and we make lemon bars in a pan she inherited from a woman who believed butter could fix it, and maybe it can but not everything.

On the morning of the meeting I wake early because the air decided to be kind for once and my brain is suspicious and awake about it. I do the thing where I rehearse my face in the mirror until it is someone else’s and then let it slack back into mine. June shows up at my apartment with two flowers in a cup because she could not bring a bouquet to the woman she hit and not feel like she was dressing a wound in a party, and we drive to the bakery with the windows down and the radio off and the sound of the city doing its chores. We do not say zucchini. We do not say anything that might tempt fate into changing its seat.

The woman’s daughter is younger than I expect, early thirties with a mouth that looks like it knows where the soft places are and a shirt with a stain from hugging someone with jam on their face. She introduces herself as Alma and says her mother’s name is Edite, and that she came here from the Azores when she was eight, and that she has hated Rhode Island in a tender, long-term way ever since because it refused to be her ideal and kept being her home. June tells her she has never been to the Azores and Alma says, “You would love my aunt’s kitchen,” and then we sit and talk about the only thing we have in common which is a night when the air was unhelpful and the light did a bad job and people tried their best with the bodies they were given.

June says she did not see her and Alma says she believes her and there is a relief in the room that is not forgiveness but is a seat you can sit in for ten minutes without your back hurting. Alma says our insurance, and Frank, who came and wore a shirt that could have gone to church, says he will handle it and that we are not going to argue about kindness and money because they are not mutually exclusive. My mother slides the lemon bars forward like a treaty. Alma says her mother is stubborn and will walk again because she walked away from a man and a country and she will not let a car have the last word. June says she is sorry again and Alma says, “I heard you,” and that is both mercy and instruction.

We leave with a sense that the world can be ferried across with small boats if you line them up and walk carefully. Outside, the heat lifts for a second and a breeze comes through that smells like the Narragansett Bay doing its constant work. June leans against the car like she needs a minute, and I stand next to her and watch a woman walk by with a tiny dog that looks like it believes in heavens we can’t access, and I think about the way an ordinary day blooms with catastrophe and repair and how the bloom is so wide you can live inside it and still not touch the edges. June says, “Tell me a joke that is not about death,” and I say, “Why did the clam refuse to share?” and she says, “Because it was shellfish,” and she rolls her eyes at herself and laughs, and there it is again, that small click like a lock testing itself and, for once, turning in the right direction.

We drive back to my place and make coffee that looks like tar and tastes like a long conversation we will be glad to have had, and we sit on the floor because we are too wired for chairs. The Swan Lake puddle has shrunk into something you could almost step over without naming it. There is a man in the alley teaching a child to throw a ball and the ball keeps rolling under a car and they keep getting it and the man keeps saying, “Again,” in a voice that is patient and not performative, which is how I know it is going to be okay for someone today. June puts her head on my shoulder and her hand on my knee and says, “I will stand where you tell me to stand,” and I say, “Stand next to me,” and she does, and for a few minutes we balance on the small, flickering certainty that sometimes the future is just a place you arrive by staying in the same room and not breaking anything you cannot fix.4

The days after the bakery meeting looked unremarkable if you were standing far enough away. From across the river, we were tiny ants carrying sugar and errands, moving along familiar routes with an efficiency that would bore a god. Up close, every move felt like trying to walk across a trampoline without disturbing the person sleeping in the middle. June went to work with a new carefulness that made children treat her like someone they needed to assist in her own rescue, which is a terrible job to give a child and yet they accepted it with the gravity of tiny judges. I went to my gigs and found that the part of my mouth that made knives was dull and the part that made spoons was working overtime. My mother developed a system of checking in that she called “just in case” and I called “performative terrorism,” which meant she texted me a photo of her morning coffee with captions like “Still alive” and expected a similar proof of life from me by noon. Frank started appearing in doorways with the serene puzzled expression of a person who lays out tools and waits to be told what needs to be fixed.

The first time I drove with June after, she handed me the keys without making eye contact, which is a trust exercise I wouldn’t do even with my dentist. We took her boxy car with its vitamin-commercial vibe and I sat in her seat and adjusted mirrors the way a surgeon touches an instrument tray. She sat with her palms flat on her thighs as if demonstrating compliance to a god who needed hand placement to check a box. We did errands with the elegance of spies—bank, bodega, gas for the grill—and we said zucchini when the light turned suddenly and a teenager on a skateboard darted into the crosswalk like a fleeing idea. I said it too loud and a woman redoing her window boxes looked over like I’d sworn at a saint, and June laughed and then cried and then held both in her mouth like you do with hard candy and a loose tooth.

We made an appointment with a therapist for her because we are modern and because Rhode Island has more therapists than clams, and yet none of them seemed to have a Tuesday. We called numbers on a list a social worker gave us at the hospital and left message after message like we were ordering a pizza at a place that had run out of dough. Someone named Dr. Feldman had an opening in three weeks and someone named Val had a cancellation tomorrow at noon, which seemed like either fate or a trap, and June took it because she prefers traps you can see. The office was in a skinny building in Pawtucket that had once been a mill and had not forgotten, and we sat in a waiting room with a couch covered in a pattern of leaves that had given up on photosynthesis. A woman with a clipboard called her name and I stood up without thinking and then sat back down because the rules of doors are clear and someone has to learn them again every time.

I listened to a white-noise machine pretending aggressively to be the ocean and tried not to write ten minutes on the way the magazines in therapist offices are always about gardens and enlightenment as if the brain were a sodden patch you can aerate. When June came out she had that post-dentist look people have when someone has been in your mouth telling you about your own bones. She said, “She asked what the thoughts feel like,” and I said, “Like we’re at a party and you can hear the bass through the wall and can’t find the door,” and she nodded and then said, “I told her about zucchini and she wrote it down like it’s a DSM thing and I’m worried we broke psychology,” and we both laughed until the receptionist, who had the expression of a rare bird glimpsed through binoculars, looked at us in a way that suggested we respect the sanctity of the fake ocean.

The first weekend in August, the city hit that point in summer where everything smells like someone else’s onions. AS220 did a festival that someone called a festival because that sounds better than “a handful of people standing near a stage and pretending time is not a thing,” and I had a spot on a Saturday afternoon between a woman who did poetry about potholes and a band whose music sounded like what happens when a marching band falls in love with a foghorn. June stood at the side with her arms folded and her mouth tilted up in that way that makes me believe in electricity as a lifestyle. I did a joke about the hospital cafeteria’s idea of salad, and one about the way local news anchors say Pawtucket like it’s a dare, and then I tried to do one about car wrecks and how life is a zipper merge and you have to let somebody in or you will starve at the entrance. It wasn’t a joke so much as a knot I brought onstage and held up and asked the audience to look at. It dangled there. My laugh armor slid down my body and startled my shoes. June met my eyes and shook her head one millimeter like, not today, and I pivoted to family stuff and the miraculous ability of my mother to make the act of returning a Pyrex seem like a Broadway number.

After, a man with a beard that had had its own contract with the weather came up and said, “That zipper merge thing, I feel that,” and I said, “Thanks,” and he said, “My cousin got t-boned by a guy on Chalkstone and now he only drinks fennel tea,” which is the kind of aftermath you can’t prepare for onstage. June and I walked the long way back to the car along Washington Street because I like the old bricks and she likes the things in windows that make promises. We passed a dress in a thrift shop that chose one shoulder and committed to the choice, and June said, “You could get away with that,” and I said, “I can get away with a lot if the room’s dark enough,” and she flicked me on the arm like she was dimming me down to a safe setting.

We visited Edite at rehab because Alma invited us and because there is a moment when you realize you cannot be forgiven in absence. The place was in East Providence in a building that tried to smell like bleach and hope at the same time and got neither quite right. Edite was propped up in a bed near a window where a plant that had been bought with good intentions was negotiating the light. Her hair in its crown braid made her look like someone had put a ring on her head. Her face had a collection of colors that I didn’t know skin came in and a dignity that made me want to stand up straighter without moving. Alma hugged June, and then her eyes flicked to me and did that calculation families do where you take attendance of grief and support and decide where to put the chairs.

June stood there with her phone in her hand like a library card. She said hello in a Portuguese that sounded like a child remembering a lullaby, and Edite smiled and said something that Alma translated as, “Your vowels are brave,” which made the entire room easier by three degrees. June said she was sorry and it was the kind of sorry that had different rooms, and Edite nodded and said the thing that saved me a little: “The world bumps. We are always carrying eggs.” She said it in Portuguese and Alma put it into English and the words crossed the room like a tray you pass carefully to someone you trust. Edite talked about the birds that come to the rehab roof and how one has a broken wing and still tries, and about the nurse who sings while she changes sheets like somebody gave her an assignment at the choir. June told her about a child who will only read if the book has a dragon, and how she is collecting dragon books like a person gathers shells and keeps the ones with holes so she can string them. They did not talk about the night, and then they did, and when they did, the air made a shape around us that felt like a hand cupped around a flame.

On the way home, June stared out the window and said, “She said she doesn’t hate me,” and I said, “I know,” and she said, “Sometimes that’s worse,” and I wanted to argue with her until the sun went down and then spend the night inventing counterarguments and wake up to continue, but instead I put my hand on the back of her neck and she leaned her head into my palm like it had a job. We drove down Waterman and watched the Brown kids who weren’t there yet haunt the hill anyway because some places just have the memory of youth pressed into them. At the corner, a man sold kites shaped like fish and I wanted to buy one and tell June it would keep us from flying away, but the metaphor was both too much and not enough, and so I drove us into the part of the afternoon where the shadows make everything look like a plan.

When we told my aunt Laura, my mother’s sister who lives in a bungalow painted the exact color of a pleasant compromise, her mouth did a thing I recognized from the day she found out my mother had borrowed her dress and returned it without mentioning the rip under the armpit. She said, “So you’re—” and then repeated the word “sisters” like it was gum that had lost its flavor, and I said, “No, we are two adults whose parents love each other and we met as adults and there was no Thanksgiving table with paper hand turkeys in our past,” and she said, “Okay,” in a tone that meant she accepted the logic and did not consent to the feelings. Frank’s brother, who works at a marina and has a tan that suggests he has been marinating in a different climate all his life, said, “You’re happy?” and when we said yes he said, “Okay then,” and clapped once like he’d finalized paperwork for a boat called Destiny’s Stepchild.

Comedy got weird in a way I could not schedule. One night at the Comedy Connection in East Providence, the room was stacked with guys who had come directly from a softball game and applied deodorant in their cars, and they wanted jokes about pizza ratios and the correct order of dip and chip. I did fine because my mouth has muscle memory, and then I found myself in the middle of a bit about being a woman on the internet and said, without meaning to, “My girlfriend says it’s still easier than being a woman on Broad,” and my mouth became an object all the men in the room wanted to tilt toward. There was a quiet that had edges. A woman at a table near the front put her hand over her chest like she’d dropped a plate. A man from Pawtucket with a neck like a mission bell said, “Girlfriend?” in the tone of a person reading a menu out loud to see if the specials are real. I said, “Yes, I learned it in a summer program,” and they laughed because they like audacity when it comes in a small package, but the night had shifted one degree and my body felt it for hours after like a current you stepped into and then out of.

The Boston open mic I had been threatening to go to for a year became a dare I took because I was tired of hearing my own voice bounce off the same walls. I drove up ninety-three with my car doing that thing where the check engine light flickers like it’s winking and you can’t decide whether it’s flirting or warning you to leave the bar. June couldn’t come because she had gotten an extra shift assigned to a camp group that had been described to her as “energetic” by someone who believes in euphemisms the way other people believe in metastasis. On the Zakim, I remembered every bridge in my life at once: the green ones, the rusty ones, the bridges you walk people back across when their thoughts put them on the wrong side of themselves. The mic was in a basement in Allston that smelled like stale adjectives. The kids there were so young and confident in their uncertainty that I wanted to mother them and slap them and learn what they were reading. I did seven minutes that felt like taking a sweater off over my head and I couldn’t see for half of it. They laughed in patches and I realized, with the kind of relief that is indistinguishable from mourning, that I like my rooms small and my laughs familiar. On the drive home I stopped at a rest area and cried in the parking lot for no good reason except that I had not cried in a rest area yet and I collect small firsts like some people collect salt.

June’s car had to go into the shop for a fender that had done its best and a light that had taken on a new philosophy, and for a while she took the bus. The bus in our part of Rhode Island is both a punishment and a parade, and it was good for her in the way that doing something inconvenient and not dying of it is good. She made friends with a woman who sat in the same seat every morning and read a Portuguese paper with a pencil like she was correcting God’s grammar. A kid with headphones and a backpack that said LIFEGUARD even though he clearly did not guard any lives nodded at her like they shared a breed. I met her at stops like we were teenagers again without ever having been teenagers together, and there was something so wholesome about it that I wanted to buy a slush and a scratch-off and call it an evening.

The second time we saw Edite, Alma was in a mood that could best be described as wry maternal. She had stories about the rehab that she told with the professionalism of someone who knows institutional kindness and its limits. One nurse had the habit of calling everyone sweetie and then talking to the wall in a voice that suggested the wall had talked back. The physical therapist was a former high school soccer player whose knees had opinions and whose advice included phrases like bend your day, which I wrote down and put on my fridge later and pretended was a quote from a poet I loved. Edite was stronger, which in rehab means she made a circle with her foot in the air and looked pleased when we clapped. June had brought massa sovada from Silver Star and Alma tore it with her hands and put slices on napkins and we all ate in a way that felt like a sacrament invented after the church lost its budget. Edite looked at us and said, slower than you say things you want to be received, “You are family. I don’t want a car to make you look away from each other. I want you to look.” It sounded like blessing and labor, and I took it like a pill I knew would get stuck in my throat and still do me good.

My mother hosted a post-wedding, post-accident, what-do-we-do-with-our-hands barbecue in the backyard on a Sunday when the sky was showing off its ability to be elaborate. She invited people we knew and people we knew of because she cannot keep the circle small without getting rashes. There was a pitcher of sangria with so much fruit in it you could mistake it for a salad, and a platter of linguica that made everyone have an opinion about the correct amount of char. Frank lit the grill like he was asking an old friend to do him a favor. June wore a tank top that belonged to a former summer and shorts that said RIVER DAY in the same cracking navy letters, and I lived in the way the skin at her shoulder caught the light like it had experience. People did what they always do when they don’t know if a thing is official yet: they asked sideways questions and leveled glances and then offered help with plates and trash and small bodies. Aunt Laura brought a potato salad with dill that made you forgive everyone in a ten-foot radius, and a neighbor from three doors down whom we only ever see when the snow has to get negotiated showed up with a six-pack and an apology for not being invited, which is the Rhode Island way of admitting you were bored.

We tried to be ordinary and failed in the way you fail when ordinary keeps moving. Someone mentioned the accident, and then someone else mentioned a different accident from 1999 like we were trading baseball cards. Frank, who could be a priest if he wanted to be respected and a bartender if he wanted to be adored, stood up with a spatula and said, “We are grateful,” and then he sat down because he knows not to overwork gratitude, and we clinked plastic cups and it sounded exactly like a bunch of people bumping their plastic cups together in a backyard and that was perfect. Later, when the lobsters had been cooked by a man who named them out loud by reading their tags like some bureaucratic Neptune, and the kids had run through the sprinkler and learned you can’t negotiate with Skippy, and my mother had convinced three separate attendees to schedule dental cleanings on the spot, June and I sat on the back steps in the exact place my mother had scolded us for flirting like teenagers and tried to be nothing.

I asked June if she wanted to tell her mother and she said, “She will know when the wind changes,” and then added, “I will tell her anyway because if she hears from an aunt she will sell my phone on Facebook,” and we laughed because white fear has edges and Azorean fear has kitchenware. We FaceTimed her later that week and she answered from a porch in Worcester that had ambitions to be a veranda. She wore a tank top that declared her allegiance to a bakery and her hair up with a pencil. We told her, and she made a face that was both Balkan and Bostonian and then she said, “Frank is a good man,” and it took me a second to realize that was her way of saying she was fine to share daughters with him. She asked June if I made her eat vegetables and June said yes and I said no, and June’s mother laughed in a way that made me want to drive to Worcester and let her teach me how to stir a pot until the bottom didn’t burn.

Not everything turned golden under the heat lamp of our new honesty. A cousin on my father’s side, a person I have known since we were both introduced to the same bowl of Chex Mix as toddlers, posted a long oblique paragraph on Facebook about the sanctity of family and how some lines shouldn’t be crossed and then used a quote from a TV preacher like it had context. My mother saw it and called me to say, with the brisk tender tone she uses when plucking a splinter from a paw, “You don’t have to answer people who are talking to themselves in public,” and I closed my laptop like it had tried to bite me. At a show at a bar in Warwick where there were more outboard motors in the parking lot than people in the room, a guy asked me after my set if I had ever thought about the kids if June and I got married and I said, “I think about kids constantly; it’s my part-time job,” and then I went home and brushed my teeth and stared at myself in the mirror and thought, like a teenager, about what getting married in Rhode Island actually means when the governor still looks like she was elected by a sewing circle and the clerk at City Hall has seen everything twice.

Sleep became a performance I put on some nights with varying reviews. June slept like a person training for a sport that happens at dawn and involves whistles. The cat regarded us as a unit and decided my lap was a topographical advantage. There were nights when the engine in June’s chest revved and she sat up and said, calmly like she was ordering a sandwich, “It’s here,” and I said the word and other words and then we made a list on our phones of the names of things that can mean a life is not over. We listed: rosemary, tote bags, psychoeducation (which we learned in therapy and enjoyed monsterizing), tire swings, the way a cashier says “you’re all set,” the habit of old men in Federal Hill to sit in chairs on the sidewalk and watch the evening walk past like it owes them rent. She listed: her third-grade teacher’s perfume, the sound a clarinet makes when you try, the smell of a gym on a Friday in fall, the way I stand when I’m looking for my keys, as if I am scanning a field. We sent the list back and forth like a game and in the morning I woke with the reverence of a person who has memorized a set of instructions in a language that is not hers.

On a Sunday when weather forgot to be decent, we drove to Colt State Park with coffee in cups that wanted to be held by hands with no rings. We walked the paths where teenagers go to rehearse confession and families go to decide whether to forgive each other for things done in kitchens. The bay was there doing its ongoing performance of horizon, and a heron stood like it had been thinking the same thought for a century. We sat on a bench where someone had carved CAREFUL into the wood with what I hoped was an old key. June said, “Do you think we’re good?” and I said, “Yes, and,” because I am not a person who can leave words alone. She said, “Say more,” and I said, “We are good at wanting and at doing the things you have to do in order to keep a want alive. We are also a mess and a risk and a Thanksgiving story waiting to be whispered in a kitchen while the gravy breaks.” She nodded and said she was fine with being whispered about if it meant being heard.

We were walking back toward the car when a boy on a bike with a number taped to his handlebars rode with the determination of someone who had been told if he finished he could have exactly what he wanted. His father jogged behind him with the jog of a man who never jogs except for a child. The boy looked like he might veer and then he didn’t, he corrected like a tiny pilot, and his father said, “See?” and we both stopped and watched because sometimes the world performs an allegory so obvious you have to shut up and clap. June reached for my hand and I gave it and we walked the rest of the way without letting go, which always feels like we are stealing something from a museum and hoping the guard is on break.

We had dinner at my mother’s that night because the world keeps grinding out meals no matter what happens and my mother will not let a week go by without presenting food to the people she believes she owns. She made chicken with lemon and capers and a salad in which every leaf had been auditioned and every tomato had been seen by a judge. Frank opened a bottle of wine and told a story about a man who tried to insure his boat against feelings, and patched into it was a message about how a policy cannot keep you from doing harm but it can keep you from losing everything when you do. In the middle of a second helping, my mother put down her fork and said, very casually in the tone people choose when they intend to be anything but, “Your Aunt Paulette asked me if this is a phase,” and we all looked at the salt like maybe it had an answer. June said, “I have never been good at phases,” and my mother said, “I know,” and then we ate like eating was political and personal, which it is.

Later, after dishes and after Frank’s predictable fight with the compost bin and after my mother stood at the sink and stared out at the dark like it owed her rent, we sat at the table with coffee and the low hum of a dishwasher pretending to be work. My mother reached across the table and took June’s hand because the thing about my mother is that she will reach, and she said, “Sweetheart, you cannot live in the car,” and June said, “I know,” and my mother said, “I mean you cannot live in that moment,” and June looked at me and then at her and then at the table and said, in the smallest voice I had heard from her yet, “I am afraid the world is sending me invoices for all the grace I took before,” and Frank said, “It isn’t an accounting you can balance,” and then he leaned back in his chair and looked at the ceiling and said, “You just pay with your good. You pay with your hands,” and that was the kind of thing he says sometimes that makes you understand how he got people to buy insurance for their boats and by accident insured their own hearts a little.

We left with containers of leftovers and a plant my mother insisted needed our light and a feeling like we had done something both tiny and massive with our evening. In the car, June said, “Do you know what it feels like when the thought comes?” and I said, “Tell me in the way you wish someone had told you something when you were ten.” She said, “It feels like the road lifts up an inch and my brain drops an inch and the inches do not like each other,” and I gripped the wheel and said, “Okay,” and then I said, “We will buy inches that fit,” and she laughed because she loves me when I am an idiot and a contractor. We drove home and the puddle that had been the Narragansett Miniverse had shrunk to a sullen pond and someone had written in chalk next to it, THERE WILL BE MORE RAIN, which felt like both a threat and a promise and I chose promise because there are only so many ways you can move through a summer that has decided to be generous and cruel on alternating hours.

On a Monday, a letter came addressed to June from something with a seal and a long name with “Commonwealth” in it even though that is not the shape of our state, and she sat on my couch with it in her hands like it might explode, and then she opened it and read words about civil procedure and dates and what to expect when you are expecting paperwork, and she breathed in and breathed out and then she said, almost laughing, “There is a hearing for my life,” and I said, “We will dress up,” because sometimes the only answer to bureaucracy is theater. We marked the date on the calendar and we marked the date on the inside of our skulls and we did the thing you do when a future event claims real estate in your brain: you clean other rooms. We folded laundry with the care of monks. We Windexed the windows like the city deserved to be seen. I bought stamps because it felt like a way of participating in a system that guaranteed that if you put something in a box it would end up where you said, and sometimes I need metaphors you can lick.

The night before the hearing, June slept on her side facing the wall like she was in a portrait from a century where women were named after seasons. I lay awake and did a tour of my fears as if they were exhibits in a museum that had poor lighting. I thought about the stage and the car and the hospital and my mother’s kitchen. I thought about Alma’s hands tearing bread and the kid who called my shoes tragic and the way a heron looks like patience was a class you could take. I thought about the first time June said my name like she had discovered a new use for it. I thought about the last time I would be able to say zucchini and have it mean, we can step away from this, and not, we have to step into it. In the morning I made coffee that could strip paint and June put on a dress that was not a dress for court because she refused to give the room that power but was also not a dress for any day you don’t remember. We drove to the courthouse with the radio off and then on and then off because neither silence nor sound felt correct and sometimes you have to choose wrong and then correct again and again until arrival.

The hallway at the courthouse was full of people who had all made choices and then been asked to make more. The ceiling was high in a way that made you either feel like a person or a bug depending on the last time you ate. A man stood against a wall in a suit that had seen other men and on his phone he told someone named Ma that it would be fine because it always is until it isn’t, and he did not sound like he believed all of it and he also didn’t need to. We found our room and our bench and our corner and our names on a list so long it looked like a poem if you squinted. Our lawyer, who was small and shaped like a doorstop and whose hair clearly had an iron in its past, introduced herself and told us to let her do the talking, and I nodded smugly like I was famous for silence.

June’s turn came and she stood and she stood good, and the judge—a woman with a face that looked like it had accepted both sorrow and an unflattering updo for a school dance and survived—asked her to state her name and then asked her to say words that felt like scraping pennies together on a plate. She said them. She said she was sorry without making it an apology that demands work, which is a kind of genius that I do not have. Alma was there with Edite’s neighbor, because Edite did not need this day, and their presence was so dignified I wanted to knit them shawls. The judge said the things judges say that are actually spells that keep people from breaking apart entirely in rooms like this. She mentioned insurance and training and duty of care in a tone that did not make me want to set fire to any wood. She was kind in a way that made my knees feel reliable. We left with papers and a plan and the understanding that the world did not end in here, it only shifted something internally that would show up later like a bruise.

On the steps outside, in the air that had been held back in the hallway and now flooded our lungs with the energy of a hundred people exhaling, June looked at me and it was like the day we sat on the steps with cherries but with a layer of dust and weather. She said, “We stood,” and I said, “We did,” and then we stood there longer than we had to because sometimes you have to linger in the frame so that later, when you tell the story, you can place yourself accurately in the picture. A woman in an orange blouse with sleeves like optimism walked by and laughed into her phone, and a man in a shirt with his name stitched on it held the door for his own reflection. Somewhere in the building, someone else was starting a thing and someone was ending, and all of it was loud and dull and monumental. June took my hand in both of hers and said, quieter than any siren, “Let’s go home and tell your mother we lived,” and I said, “She already texted me ‘Well?’ with six question marks,” and she laughed with her mouth open and her eyes half-closed and I collected the sound and put it next to rosemary, tote bags, and the way a cashier says you’re all set.My mother opens the door as if the door were a person she’s trying to impress and then pulls me in so fast the air behind me has to catch up. She has flour on her cheek like she rehearsed sympathy in the kitchen and decided food would be her messenger. Frank is behind her with his hands in his pockets as if he knows he is extra furniture until he is not. June steps over the threshold and my mother sees the paperwork in her hand like it has a temperature. There is a small pause, and then the thing my mother says is not a question and not an answer: “We lived.” She says it like you’d say grace in a household where grace is a theory and dinner is a fact. We stand there with our shoes half on and half off, and because we are us, because we cannot help it, the next thing we do is find chairs, and we sit.

The cups already on the table are not an accident. My mother has set them down on coaster rings that say Be Nice To Me I’m From Here in a font that believes itself. She pours coffee the color of resolve and slides a plate of cranberry-orange scones that look like a summer project that got serious. Frank, who cannot not make a plan, makes one: we will eat, then June will nap, then we will go somewhere that is neither courthouse nor kitchen. His face is soft around the eyes in a way that makes you consider worship. June nods like her head is connected to his sentences and she’s willing to be moved by them.

I tell my mother the smallest version of what happened in the longest possible way. I tell her the judge’s hair and Alma’s shawl and the way the air in hallways tries to be neutral and fails. I tell her about the list on the wall with names that look like ingredients. I tell her the way June stood. When I say that word my mother reaches for June’s hand and squeezes like she’s checking a fruit for ripeness. “Good,” she murmurs, to June or to the day, I can't tell. “You did the work. You stand, you tell, you don’t ask the ground to move for your convenience.”

After, June sleeps on the couch like a soldier in a story told to children to make them brave. Her mouth relaxes into a line I haven’t seen in weeks. The cat, whom my mother allowed into the house only because he is majestic in a way she respects, installs himself on June’s calves and purrs like a small generator. I take a photo and then don’t send it to anyone because it feels like a sacrament. My mother and I sit on the back steps and look at the world my mother insists on owning, a yard that has opinions and a grill that owes him money. Because she is who she is, she says, “Okay, logistics,” before the dew has even decided what to do. “Are you staying here two nights a week? Do you want me to make up the guest room with the quilt that looks like it dated your aunt in the eighties? Or are you going to alternate between apartments and pretend you don’t always end up in the same bed? We can at least create a map of the lie.”

“Subtle,” I say, and then I hear my mouth do a thing it hasn’t done in a while, which is tell the truth without jokes pre-installed. “I want her to sleep where she sleeps best. It’s going to change from night to night.” My mother nods, unsurprised. “Also,” I add, because I am tired of my cowardice, “we are a situation. I get it. If you need to tell people that we’re complicated, get your good china out. But don’t minimize us for them. Or me.”

“I am not in the minimization business,” she says, which is true. “I built my life on the backs of the things I refused to make small.” Then she does that thing she saves for when the wind is already going in my direction: she kisses the top of my head like I am still made of baby bones and luck. It is annoying and correct. Inside, the fridge sighs and I think, not for the first time, that in a world of unreliable narrators, my mother’s appliances are the most honest things we have.

We drive to a place that calls itself a botanical garden because there are labels on the shrubs. It’s really a park with aspirations and a donor list. The air is doing its best impression of an early fall even though the calendar is still wearing sandals. We walk the paths like people who have temporarily escaped a building full of rules. June takes a photo of a sign that says, Please Don’t Climb On The Dry Stone Wall, It’s Old, and sends it to Alma who is at rehab negotiating with a nurse about socks. We sit on a bench that has someone’s name on it and I try not to turn that into a bit about how naming rights are the only immortality still on the table for people who don’t believe in afterlives. June leans forward with her elbows on her knees and says, “I am not special.” It takes me a second to understand it’s not despair, it’s relief. “I am not the first person to do a terrible ordinary thing and then have to live. I can live. They make room for us.” She looks at the plants like they might nod in solidarity. They do not, but some bees do close circles above the purple heads of a plant that sounds biblical.

At home, the puddle has a new name because the neighbors are unlicensed poets and the chalk is cheap. This week, someone has written OCEAN OF MOSTLY APPEARING and underlined it twice. The lei is gone from the plastic swan, replaced by what is either a string of Mardi Gras beads or the collar of a dog who had a different plan for his evening. I send June a photo with no caption and she sends me back one of a small hand holding an index card with the word resilient penciled light and shaky. “My second grader learned a new word and used it today when his shoelace broke,” she writes. “Either I am in love with all children or I am going to cry in a grocery store aisle at noon.” “Same,” I write. “We are building toward a performance piece at Stop & Shop.”

September is a machine that comes with a key. The first day of school does that thing where you can feel children’s breathing from three blocks away. June is in her vest with her whistle tucked into her shirt like a secret and a new pair of shoes that promise they won’t lie this time. I am at the corner with her not because she asks but because I am sneaky and because the morning needs witnesses. The parents are a parade of fatigue and hope, and the kids are tiny astronauts with backpacks, and the tardy ones run like time is a joke you can beat with shoes. A minivan stops halfway into the crosswalk because a hand somewhere else in the driver’s life is waving, and June steps into the world with her palm up and her stance like the beam of a lighthouse, and everybody obeys the ancient law of a woman telling them not to kill anybody today. When a car idles too close, I hear her breath change, just a hitch, and I say quietly, “Cantaloupe,” which feels too sticky in my mouth for public, and she doesn’t laugh and she doesn’t need to, but she moves forward anyway, and the river of bodies passes without incident. When her shift is done, an old man who has decided to be old on purpose gives her a thumbs up like he invented approval. “Nice whistle work,” he says, and she takes the blessing as if it were official.

Comedy changes shape depending on who’s in the room. I say this like I invent it every time it happens. After the hearing something in me takes off its high heels and puts on sneakers. At a brewery in Pawtucket where the floors remember labor and the bartenders wear their facial hair like a houseplant they forgot to water, I try a new bit about apologies and paperwork. I say, “They don’t tell you grief comes with an RSVP,” and a woman in the second row with a face like a gentle lake nods so hard I stop mid-sentence and ask her name. “Donna,” she says, and I say, “Donna, how many ceremonies have you attended without a dress,” and she laughs and it turns out she’s been to three funerals where she made sandwiches in the basement and she takes that skill seriously. Later, she comes up to me at the merch table I don’t really have and presses a folded twenty into my hand and says, “This is for the next time you want to leave it all onstage and you think you should pull it back. Don’t. Risk my money.” I go home and tape the bill under my bathroom mirror because I am a witch who needs paper talismans and also because bathrooms see what we really are when we practice in the morning.

June goes to therapy on Tuesdays at noon and I meet her afterward sometimes with a sandwich I disguise as love. She comes out with a face like someone who has been listening to a song with one wrong note that she has learned to accept because the rest is gorgeous. We sit in the car and she tells me about intrusive thoughts like they are a family that won’t stop knocking. “Val says I don’t have to let them in,” she says. “I can open the door a crack and say, ‘I see you, I’m not serving you pie.’” “No pie for pests,” I say. “We are a pest-free pie household.” She grins and then her mouth goes serious. “Val asked if there are any times I want to hurt myself that aren’t about cars,” she adds, like she’s mentioning a new brand of soap. I look at her, the car doing its gentle idle, the world moving like a belt around a waist, and I say, “Do you want to?” She shakes her head. “No,” she says. “And also, sometimes my brain performs a show without my consent. We’re working on the venue’s security.” We sit there and watch a man in a limousine driver’s suit eat a yogurt in his lap with a level of attention I could worship.

When Edite is released, Alma texts from a front lawn where three cousins are putting bunting on a porch like it’s being inducted into a hall of fame. “Come on Sunday,” she writes. “We will sit and not talk about cars and my tia will tell you about the bird with the broken wing again because she believes repetition is a kind of repair.” We go and there is massa sovada and coffee with too much milk and cheese that announces its presence from the next room. Edite is in a chair near the window with her crown braid and her cane, and when we arrive she makes that sound that women make when something good comes in the door, part greeting, part proof of life. She pulls June toward her with a strength that has been lazily counted out by doctors because doctors cannot measure yours, and she touches June’s face like she is making sure it is not a trick. “You look,” she says, and then cannot find the word in English, and Alma jumps in, “You look like you live,” and June nods as if she’s been told the correct answer. They talk about the rehab and the ritual of breakfast and the way a woman sings like the room is paying attention. Then, as predicted, Edite tells the bird story again, and this time June asks questions, and they acquire details: the bird is gray, angular, mean when it needs, beautiful despite itself. Its wing is not so much broken as re-imagined. It has made a deal with the air. Edite looks at us both like we have not yet made the right deals with ours.

I get offered a weekend opening for a headliner who made me laugh in college when I was pretending to be a person who didn’t need any of this. The email is from a man with a name that sounds like a TV detective, and the subject line is too cordial. The show is in New York, and the money is not good, which is how you know it’s a real opportunity. The dates sit on the calendar in a spot that has already been claimed by something small: the school fundraiser where June asked if I would MC the raffle that always goes wrong. The headliner’s manager wants an answer in twenty-four hours because managers ask for what they think time can bear. June is on my couch with my cat using her stomach like a hill, and I tell her in a voice I think is neutral. Her mouth does a complicated four-second dance of support and math. “Go,” she says immediately, because she is noble in a way I would resent in someone I liked less. Then she says, “The raffle can be bad without you,” and laughs, and then her laugh gets quieter like it’s remembering a more polite version of itself. “We could do both,” I say, because I am a Rhode Islander and therefore assume distance is a suggestion. “I could MC the raffle Friday, drive to New York Saturday, crash on someone’s floor, do the late show, then drive back Sunday for the barbecue that isn’t a barbecue but is people with food standing around pretending to be casual.” “You will die,” June says. “No,” I say. “I will pretend I am twenty-five.” “Same,” she says. “We will both pretend.” It turns into a plan, which is a feeling akin to religion.

The fundraiser is in the school gym, which smells like floors and sugar and consequences. I stand at half court with a mic that works as well as any authority in a room full of children: intermittently. June has a clipboard and a whistle and a look that says she can turn chaos into a packet. Parents, who are the bravest people I know outside of nurses and kindergarten teachers, stand with plates of cookies and the expressions of those who are participating in community against the wishes of their private selves. I MC the raffle like a priest who has lost his liturgy. I call numbers and the wrong child comes up and I let them have the prize anyway because I am weak, and then I go on a sermon about fairness that somehow becomes a bit about pi and pie and then June blows her whistle and everyone claps because noise is often mistaken for order. A small girl with braids wins a basket of art supplies and the look on her face makes something in my chest turn over and lie down like a dog. A boy with hair like a broom asks me why adults always hold microphones so close like they’re telling a secret to a mouth, and I say, “Because we are,” and he shrugs like, I knew it.

New York is a metal animal pretending to be a city. I forget this every time. I drive down in a car that has taken only one vow—to keep trying—and I almost miss the bridge because my phone believes tolls are a moral question. I stay on a couch that has seen more comics lie to themselves than any licensed therapist. The club smells like ambition and citrus cleaner. The headliner tells me to “do me,” which is advice that has started wars. Onstage, I feel the old itch for a larger audience and the new pull of the small room where June stands with a clipboard. The New York laughter is taller, but it is not kinder, and it doesn’t have to be, it owes me nothing. After, a kid in a shirt that says Ironic Ironic asks me if Providence is real and I say, “Only in afternoons,” and he looks like he expected that answer.

The drive back is at sunrise because I am trying to beat the part of the day when other people exist. The highway is a long sentence with no punctuation and I am bad at reading it. I think about the way the Narragansett Bay looks from the bridge, how it pretends to be still and never is, and I think about June’s hands, which are instruments, and I think about my mother’s lists, which are spells. When I pull into my street, the chalk by the puddle has a new message: PLEASE USE WITH CARE. The plastic swan has acquired a friend, another plastic bird someone rescued or punished, and now they face each other like they have news. I carry my bag upstairs, and my apartment breathes me in and lets me go.

June is at my table with her laptop and a stack of something that looks like paper dolls and is in fact a reading intervention strategy. She looks up and her face does the thing it does when I come home, which is fix my day in one second. “You did it,” she says, and I say, “I did something,” and she says, “You did the drive,” and we both pretend that was the larger feat. I sit and put my head down on her shoulder like the day beat me at cards. She presses her lips to my hair like she’s sealing an envelope. We tell each other our nights. The headliner was funnier than me and he bought everyone pizza and pronounced marinara like a character. The raffle turned into a lesson on probability and a child discovered she has a gift for scams. We eat toast thick with butter that is wrong and right, and then we nap with our legs tangled like we are daring regret to try us.

Afterwards, we go to the Day of Portugal festival, which is a small universe that appears every year on a corner and insists on remembering. Flags wave with a competence that feels rehearsed. There is a stage where a teenage girl sings a fado with a voice like a church burned and rebuilt, and an old man nods like he built the scaffolding. Alma meets us by a grill with fish that look like they knew poems. Edite is there, leaning on her cane, wearing a sweater that makes her look like a cloud with an opinion. She sees June and her face opens with a light that has nothing to do with any electrical grid. The parade goes by with a float of children in paper costumes representing islands that are half a world away and also on a table at the Knights of Columbus. Everyone claps at odd moments because clapping is a way to say “we know you.” June buys a lottery ticket from a man whose face implies he has survived his own raffles. “We are never leaving,” I say. “We have never left,” she says. “We just forget and remember at seasonally appropriate intervals.”

My mother makes a comment at dinner about leases and this time we do not pretend it is hypothetical. The plant she gave us has been keeping score; it has, despite our personalities, lived. “We should live with each other on purpose,” June says, as if we have not been doing it on accident for months. “Yes,” I say, and my mother says, “I have been waiting to be asked to have an opinion,” and then provides two. The first is practical: whose apartment? Hers is three flights up with light that pours in like a flood and one neighbor who sings opera badly at five. Mine is second floor with a path to Swan Lake and the sound of the mill at five thirty like a man stretching. The second is controlling disguised as generous: a list of landlords who are less awful, compiled by a cousin who dates property and calls it names. Frank says, “We could also find a new place where you both can hate everything in the same ratio,” and this is, somehow, wisdom. We make a plan to spend a Sunday looking, and my mother makes a list with columns and highlighters as if real estate is a math test and we were taught long division.

The first place we see is a second-floor unit above a bakery that refuses to call itself a bakery and instead is a bread lab. The air smells like yeast and intention. The floors tilt toward whatever story was heavier. The landlord is a man who insists we see the basement as if basements have ever changed anyone’s mind about a kitchen. He says things like “garden-level future” and “cozy,” which my mother hisses to me means “no closets” and “there is a door that doesn’t close.” The second has a porch that faces a brick wall in a way that feels like an arranged marriage. The third is a dream if dreams had pipes that clank like a person knocking to be let out. We stand in a room that would be our room if we were people who believed in fate and that fate could afford rent, and June says, “Our couches would hate this place,” and I say, “Your cat would unionize,” and we both know we are not saying no to the apartment, we are saying yes to a version of ourselves that won’t fit here.

We end up back at my place because sometimes home is the last place you look. We rearrange furniture like it owes us loyalty. We make a small altar to our competent past: a bowl from Alma, a pen from the courthouse, a pebble from Colt State Park, a whistle on a hook. My landlord who pretends not to know me but does because he doubts his property will survive me, gives a reluctant okay to changes provided they are not visible from the street. We paint one wall a color with a name so earnest I can’t say it without blushing—Harbor Dawn—and June labels boxes with big letters that suggest bravery. The cat walks into the bedroom like it bought it. I take a photo of the puddle from the new angle and it looks like someone else’s metaphor.

One night after everything is in an acceptable amount of disarray, we are lying in bed with the window open to the social life of moths, and June says, “Do you ever worry that we are performing this for ourselves?” I don’t pretend to misunderstand. “All the time,” I say. “But I think that might be part of how we make a life. You perform until the performance and the person shake hands and then you can take off one pair of shoes.” I pause because there is a heartbeat in the room that belongs to the refrigerator compressor, because this is when I could make it a joke and choose not to. “I also think I am not joking when I tell people mine,” I add. “I am just using the voice they’ll listen to.” June reaches over blindly and touches my mouth with two fingers like she is taking the temperature of my honesty. “You can rest,” she says, which is so sexy it should be illegal.

We go for a drive at night because therapy says practice and because we like knocking on the door of our own fear and telling it to bring a sweater. June drives and I sit with my eyes doing the work of noticing without narrating. The roads are not empty because this is not a place where nights ever are. There is a couple arguing kindly while they wait for a bus, a guy pulling a dolly down a sidewalk like the dolly owes him rent, a bakery light that has been on since the seventies. The air has that late September feel like a paragraph that is almost done. A car ahead of us turns without the courtesy of signal and my throat tenses and I say, before she asks, “Zucchini,” and she breathes out a laugh that is not an apology. At a red light we look over and there’s a woman in the next car singing to herself in the way that means she does not expect to be heard, which is the mark of a really free heart. As we idle, June says, “I love you,” and at the exact same time the light changes and we both say, “Go,” and then we laugh like we invented it. She squeezes the wheel and pulls us through the intersection like that sentence could be completed in two directions, and both be true, and I look at the road and at her and at the city that will never give us permission and will never take it away, and I think: this is how we live, we pick a word and we say it to the dark and the dark answers, and sometimes the answer is just the sound an engine makes when it decides to be good for ten more miles.

The next morning, my mother drops off a bag of pears because she can’t let a life go by without a bag of something being dropped at someone’s door. She pokes around with her eyes and says we made the place look intentional which is her highest compliment. Frank lugs in a box of tools he pretends he only owns for his boat and then proceeds to fix three things that, until his hands touched them, had not announced themselves as broken. He holds a level against our Harbor Dawn wall like the wall is a suspect. “Looks good,” he says, then, lower, “Looks like yours.” June brings out coffee on a tray because she has a stupid idea about presentation that I love. We stand in my kitchen, which is our kitchen, which is my mother’s staging area, which is Frank’s workshop, and people drink and talk and say the words we have learned to say in the correct order: work, weather, teeth, cars.

After they leave, I sit on the floor with my back against the cabinet and feel the slow hum start to match my ribs. There are things to do: call the headliner’s manager back with thank you language, pick a date to visit Worcester before it snows, send Alma the photo of Edite smiling under the banner that says VIVA, write a new bit about Harbor Dawn and honesty and the way paint names would fail under oath. June walks into the room and sits down too, cross-legged like she is demonstrating breathing to children. “We could make a calendar of the stupid things we’ve survived,” she says out of nowhere. “We could hang it next to your mirror, like Donna’s twenty.” I grin. “January: The Accident,” I say. “February: The Court.” “March: The Bread Lab,” she says. “April: Your Boston Rest Stop Cry,” I add. “May: Lemon Bars,” she says, solemn. “June: Me,” I say, and she makes a face and throws a crumpled receipt at me. “July: Zucchini,” she says, and we both look at each other and there is a shared pause that we earned. “August: Rehab,” I say. “September: The Move,” she says. “October,” I start, and then I stop, because the street outside has a sound so ordinary it is holy: a child laughing and a ball skittering and a bicycle brake and someone saying careful for the tenth time because love is repetition, and we sit there and listen like that is our job.By October, the light in Providence had learned restraint. It came in late and left early and on its way out it smudged everything, like a kid with frosting on his fingers laying a hand on each house. The puddle in the lot got named The Bay of Reasonable Expectations by the upstairs neighbor who had a way of managing his hope like a sourdough starter, and the plastic swans faced each other as if negotiations were ongoing and cordial. The Harbor Dawn wall dried into a kind of calm that didn’t try to convince you of anything, and on mornings when June left early to keep small bodies from doing large harm, I drank coffee and leaned my head against it because you can lean your head against any color if it stays. My mother sent a photo of a calendar she’d made with our survival holidays highlighted in green and our dentist appointments starred like birthdays, and underneath she wrote, “October: settle,” which made me feel both seen and volunteered.

I took a week and wrote, which is not the same as writing. I sat on the couch with a document open and watched my cat consider stealing my thumb drive and starting a life under the radiator, and I drafted and undrafted sentences that were too honest to tell a room of strangers and too mean to tell my mother. June would come home smelling like outside, which in fall has its own cologne, and drop into the chair and say, “Tell me what you hate,” and I would tell her about the way a bit collapses if you push on it, about how Harbor Dawn sounds like a politician’s promise, about how every time I tried to talk about the accident onstage it grew a second head and hissed. She’d listen with that look she has of holding two truths in her lap, patting both, and then she’d say something like, “You could talk about apology like it’s furniture. You move it around to make a room work, but sometimes there’s nowhere to put it that doesn’t block a door,” and I would nod and pretend I hadn’t just been given better writing than I had invited into the house.

We drove to Worcester to see her mother because the season demands pilgrimage and because June wanted to say a thing that felt less like warning and more like news. Her mother’s porch sagged with the glory of potted plants no one had gotten around to writing poems about. The man with the snow globes, whose name I still don’t know because he is, in cast terms, The Man With The Snow Globes, waved from the kitchen with the reluctant benevolence of someone who has surrendered the house to a conversation not about him. June’s mother hugged us like we were evidence of her good judgment, then sat with her feet tucked underneath her and listened while June told her that love had arrived with a clipboard and a whistle. The laugh that came from her had salt in it and warmth and a little vinegar, and when she said, “Frank will treat you right or I come down with my rolling pin,” June rolled her eyes and I said, “He will,” and we were all telling the truth to the extent we could afford it. We ate massa sovada with butter that refused moderation and told stories about autumns where nothing dramatic happened and yet we remember them because quilted jackets were involved, and when we left she tucked apples into our bag like luck could be prepared in advance.

At night, the city made its winter noises early, the radiators starting up their annual campaign for sympathy and the mill fans across the alley coughing into duty. June learned a new therapy trick where she named five blue things in the room when her thoughts tried to throw a party without our consent, and I learned there are more blues in a small apartment than you think when you’re trying to save a life. We counted the blue on a cereal box, the blue band of my sports bra draped on a chair it did not belong on, the chip on the mug handle, the stripe on the cat’s toy we neither of us admitted to buying, the sly corner of Harbor Dawn when the moon laid its own version on top. It worked enough to make us superstitious, which is to say it worked.

I remember a Tuesday where it rained the way Rhode Island rains when it can’t commit: sideways, annoyed, as if someone complained to management about weather. AS220 had a storytelling night and a woman named Ruby told a story about a winter when she left two marriages without moving apartments, and I followed her with something about how churches smell like closets when you’re the last one out, and then I surprised myself by saying, casually, to a room that had not asked, “I fell in love with my step-sister at thirty,” and you could hear the floorboards under the audience adjust themselves. It was the kind of silence that is either rejection or reverence, and in that long second my laugh popped its head up from the trench and asked if I needed armor, and I said no, and then I said, “By step I mean I stepped into her orbit after the vows, calm down,” and they did, a little, but their faces stayed in that position people’s faces get into when you are about to show them a trick that might be a knife, and I did the rest of the set without the joke’s crutches. After, a young woman with a sweatshirt that said CCRI in a font that believed in itself stood in front of me until I noticed her and said, “I didn’t know you could just say it and then keep talking,” and I said, “It’s one of my life hacks,” and we smiled at each other like we were giving each other a pass that would expire at midnight.

Frank started coming around with odd jobs the house did not have the decency to need. He replaced a loose hinge that had begun to identify as a doorbell, and he ran a bead of caulk along the kitchen window as if drafting a treaty with the wind. He had an opinion about the proper angle for dish drainer racks and the moral obligation of a level shelf, and I let him fuss because fussing is how he prays. One afternoon while June was on her corner admonishing a BMW with a whistle that meant business, he stood in our doorway and looked at Harbor Dawn in the way men of his generation look at color, which is appreciatively and at a small angle. “You know,” he said like the weather had asked him, “in rough water, you keep your eyes ahead, not down. If you look at the waves you’ll think you’re smaller. If you look at where you’re going you’ll stop remembering how small you are,” and then he asked if I had a Phillips head as if my name had never owned pain.

We went back to see Edite because life demanded proof that progress isn’t an urban myth. Her cane had a tennis ball on the bottom like a small joke that refused to be too silly, and she had adopted a ritual where she put on lipstick whether or not she was leaving the house, because why should the mirror go without joy. She told us the bird with the broken wing had left and then come back and she took this as a lesson and also an insult, and she insisted on teaching us to make couscous in a way that suggested Morocco had moved into her kitchen and refused to pay rent. Alma piled plates into our hands and talked about the bureaucracy of recovery, which is its own language with false cognates, and when she hugged June at the door she whispered, “You stand like someone who knows which way is forward,” and I wanted to embroider it on a towel and also a warning label.

On Halloween, I MC’d a costume contest in a church hall where the prize was a cake and the stakes were mortal. There were three pirates, two witches who had never agreed on anything in their lives but matched eyeliner, a hotdog that had a moral stance, and a child dressed as a stop sign which felt like Providence blessing us in a language we understood. June came in her crossing guard vest over a skeleton jumpsuit and the kids screamed her name like she was Taylor Swift, and I figured if the afterlife had this moment in it, I could walk into any light. In the middle of my bit where I do a voice for a road cone counseling drivers that “we’re all going the same direction, Karen,” I saw my mother in the back with her phone up recording me, and when our eyes caught, she put it down like she’d been caught cheating on joy with her future nostalgia.

We took a night and drove to the ocean, the actual one, the one that Rhode Island has to keep explaining is fact and not advertisement. Narragansett had put on its winter face, which is all cheekbones and brine, and we stood with our coats wrapped around us like arguments we weren’t going to finish. June said, “Do you think we’re using that word too much,” and I knew she meant zucchini, not love, which we said sparingly like a spice with a history. I told her I was learning the difference between warding something off and inviting something in, and that sometimes the word felt like a hand on a small of a back entering a crowded room and sometimes it felt like jinxing. “Val says it’s a bridge word,” she said. “We’re allowed to use bridges until we learn to swim.” The water did its long exhale and I thought, for the first time in months, about nothing but the water, and I laughed at myself for calling that nothing, which is how you know something good is happening.

When the first frost came in a mean little veil, the puddle went still enough to reflect the project of our building like it cared to be accurate. Someone had written in chalk WINTER IS THE AUDITOR and added a small heart, because in this town we decorate even our doom. I started to say yes to smaller shows and no to bigger ones, not because I didn’t want the bigger laugh but because the smaller rooms taught me to breathe like a person. My mouth got better at curving around tender things without cutting them, and when a man in a Patriots hat asked me when I was gonna settle down, I said, “I already did, it’s called Harbor Dawn,” and his face did the math and decided to let it add up.

There was a night when June called from the car and I heard the sound in her voice I knew from the curb, the one that means the light in the inside hallway has flickered. She was three blocks away and asked me to meet her at the intersection where the mural of the woman with the enormous hands blesses traffic, and I put my shoes on without tying them like a teenager running from a house. She sat with her hands open on the wheel like she was showing a cop she had nothing to hide, and I got in and put my hand over both her hands, and I said, not solemn, not silly, “Zucchini and cantaloupe and the smell of your mother’s porch and Harbor Dawn and that time the kid called my shoes tragic,” and she laughed with part of her and cried with the other part, and then she said, “The road is two inches up,” and I said, “I’ll bring it down,” and it was only words and it was also a rope. We drove home and ate pears with our knives pointed toward the cutting board like good people and watched the kind of TV where people buy houses in cities they don’t live in, and when we went to bed we said goodnight to everything we could remember and it felt like making a small treaty with sleep.

November did that thing where it slid in on its belly and you didn’t notice it until you were halfway through it. My mother developed a relationship with Alma that involved recipes and disdain for other people’s potato salad, and I watched with a small fear I couldn’t name as they found each other’s favorite insults. Frank found a part-time kid from the neighborhood who wanted to “learn boats,” which I found suspicious and charming, and he brought him to the house to carry things as if muscles could be taught and inherited like antique vases. The cat developed a fascination with the corner of the rug where Harbor Dawn met the old hardwood, which I took as a review.

I did a show in a bar in Pawtuxet Village where the ceiling was low and the owner had a rosary nailed behind the register in case money didn’t work one day. In the back, a woman I recognized from Facebook as my cousin’s cousin hovered like a bat waiting for its cue. After my set, she approached me with the smile of a person who has decided we are friends because I once liked a post about her dog. “You make it sound like we’re not supposed to be ashamed,” she said, half challenge, half compliment. I wanted to say we can be ashamed in shifts, but what I said was, “I’m embarrassed of a lot of things, but I’m trying to choose them better,” and she nodded like she had a calendar to reorganize.

The plan for Thanksgiving was a compromise that required a spreadsheet. Worcester on Wednesday night for soup and a family argument June’s mother kept in the oven like a casserole she would bring out if the conversation cooled. Thursday at my mother’s with a turkey the size of a baby those same relatives would hold wrong, and a seating chart she revised nine times because Aunt Laura and Frank’s brother had become friends and she did not trust friendship without a form. Friday at Alma’s to deliver a pie that tried too hard and listen to Edite tell the bird story in a seasonal edition with leaves. I wrote my set for the bar on Wednesday where they paid in cash that smelled like fried onions, and I told myself I would not do my mother jokes because she would hear them if the wind turned, and then I did anyway because I am greedy and she laughed from a table near the ice machine and later told me not to say “vagina” so loud on the day before a national holiday.

Between the holiday logistics and the long exhale of fall, there were the small ordinary miracles you sometimes have to list to believe. A boy who wouldn’t look anyone in the eye for months held up a drawing of his cat and said, “This is for you,” to June and she did not cry until the copier jammed. A man on the bench outside the Rite Aid said, “Nice smile,” and meant mine in a way that did not require fight or flight, and I did not ruin it with a bit about teeth. A stranger found my wallet on Atwells and left it at the bakery with a note that said “I’m sorry, I took $5 because I needed a bus,” and I felt so affectionately toward his honesty I wanted to shame fund him.

On the first really cold morning, when the kind of cold that makes metal sound like truth settled in, June stood at the corner in a hat with a pom-pom that made her look like someone’s favorite memory of winter and stopped a car with a palm and a look. I watched from the café with a coffee that believed in my ability to thaw and felt something in me settle into the season like it had been waiting for a cue. The laughter, the ka-chunk of my mother’s dishwasher, the whisper of tires on wet roads, the priestly beep of the crosswalk, the cough of the mill fans, the whisper-scrape of Harbor Dawn when my shoulder leaned against it—all of it was our weather. I stood up, put my tip in the jar like a vote, and went to meet June at the corner, because even in a city where everything is right around the corner, there is nothing like standing at the exact corner where your life turns and waving traffic through with a hand you trust.November did what the chalk promised and sent an auditor in a gray suit to walk through our life with a clipboard and a small frown, taking notes on drafts and dents and whether the spare light bulbs were in a place that would make sense to anyone besides my mother. The air smelled like someone had simmered leaves and meat on low until both gave up and became soup. On the way to the bodega for milk and the kind of cereal that pretends it builds character, I watched a man on a ladder take down a sign that had said summer in a font with shoulders, and I thought, there is a whole profession of people whose job is to roll up seasons and put them away in a closet where the labels fell off a long time ago. I made jokes about it into my phone and listened back and hated my own mouth, the way it tried to balance a tray of cups while wearing roller skates, and then I sent the audio to June because she is the rare audience who knows when to clap and when to say, “Stop and tell me what you actually feel,” and she texted back, “Come sit in the car by my corner at dismissal, bring a bag of clementines, we’re going to need both vitamin C and traffic.”

At the corner, the wind made itself known by giving everybody opinions about their ears. The parents wore their coats with the resigned proud posture of veterans, and the latecomers came with excuses that were obviously true—shoes hid, socks revolted, the baby ate the keys—and June stood in her vest with her palm up like the world could be paused if someone who meant it asked. A Buick rolled the crosswalk like a teenager and I watched June’s breath hitch and then smooth, watched the small muscles around her mouth do the math that keeps other people alive. When the river slowed to a trickle she got in the car and put her forehead against the steering wheel not in defeat but in a ritual that says her day had teeth. I handed her a clementine and she bit into it like a refugee at a banquet. “Val says I should picture the thought as a billboard I’m driving past,” she said, juice shining at the corner of her mouth. “You don’t get out of the car to write on a billboard. You notice the stupid font and you keep going.” I said, “That is an insult to fonts and also we should buy stock in fruit,” and she laughed with a stripe of weariness through the middle, the kind of laugh that knows how many standing ovations a day requires.

Worcester on Wednesday night was a porch lit by an overachieving string of LEDs and the smell of soup that had taken offense on someone’s behalf. June’s mother handed me a bowl that could have mended a town and said, “You will eat,” with the tone of a dictator who specializes in mercy. The man with the snow globes came in late with a grocery bag and a look of a person who had to find parking in a city designed by people who hated the future; he kissed June’s mother on the cheek like gratitude is a currency you can pass by mouth. The argument lurking in the oven had to do with who remembered what about a winter in the Azores where it rained indoors and the neighbor grew tomatoes out of spite, and I followed along like it was a play in a language I didn’t speak but respected. We told her about the calendar my mother had defaced with green and stars, and she approved of any plan that made a thing look like it had a spine. June said we would sleep at my mother’s the next night and Alma’s the next after, and June’s mother waved a wooden spoon like a wand and said, “Sleep where they cook,” which is a theological position I could convert to.

Thanksgiving at my mother’s was a production with staging notes, a matinee of competence starring her jawline and Frank’s patience, with Aunt Laura as comic relief and the neighbor from three doors down in a cameo that involved bringing store-bought rolls and apologizing for the bag with a sincerity that made me feel tender toward plastic. The turkey was a creature we had done everything but christen; it sat in the middle of the table like an offering to gods we had outgrown but kept in the calendar because who are we to throw out a reason to baste. My mother moved through the room with the brisk tender stride of a general who trained as a nurse, touching shoulders, correcting stove knobs that needed no correction, handing me a stack of plates and whispering, “Smile like you’re having a nice time,” which made me smile the exact way she didn’t mean. Frank carved with a concentration that suggested he had a side gig in surgery, and when he looked up and said, “Dark? White?” in that neutral tone that lets people tell the truth about their loyalties, I thought about all the choices you can make with grace if someone hands you a knife and doesn’t flinch.

It took three drinks for Aunt Paulette to stop complimenting the centerpiece and start the slow approach to the thing she wanted to ask. She has the face of a person who cannot keep order in a stationary store because the pens seduce her. She perched on a chair like a bird that learned to be furniture and said, “So the two of you,” and I said, “Yes,” because both comedy and adulthood are better when you avoid euphemism unless you’re making a point. She nodded like her neck had a little metal hinge, then asked me if I worried, in a tone that made worry sound like a profession with benefits, “about optics,” which is Rhode Island for people seeing you at the CVS and telling their cousin who tells the hairdresser. I said, “I worry about sunscreen, car maintenance, and whether my jokes turn mean when I’m tired; the rest is the weather,” and she took a bite of sweet potato and looked around the room like she had been hoping for a wind to do something dramatic and had to content herself with the dishwasher exhaling.

Somewhere between cranberries and the annual ritual where Frank insists we all say one thing we are grateful for and my mother insists we don’t make this political and someone always fails, the front door opened and my father appeared as if conjured by a joke I had told three years ago to no one. He came in with wind on his coat and a new wife I recognized from Facebook as a person who likes to get her hair done on Tuesdays and post beep-boop quotes about resilience. My mother’s mouth did not drop; she is physically incapable. She smoothed the tablecloth with two fingers in a movement that could sand a floor, then said, “Of course,” because of course, and then, to the new wife, “Take a seat,” in a tone that put out placemats. My father hugged me in the way that men who did not raise you hug you at public events, which is to say briefly, with an apologetic pat on the back like a metronome marking an unfamiliar time signature. He said, “Kiddo,” which made me want to count my teeth and then leave the house. He looked at June with that man’s calculation—beautiful, attached, relevant to me how—and said, “You must be the daughter,” which in our family is not a safe sentence to finish.

June said hello and gave him a hand, not her smile, and my father’s eyes did a thing like the lights dimmed in a theater because he had had a thought he did not want to be seen having. My mother put a plate in front of him and our little table of nations made room—it is what tables do, what families do in public, what Rhode Island does because the state is small and chairs breed. For a while the conversation darted around my father the way fish bolt around a shoe, all the topics hopping to other rocks: taxes, traffic on 95, whether it is disrespectful for the governor to wear sneakers and if so which brand would be sufficiently reverent. Then he told a joke about a crossing guard that went on too long and became a story and then a complaint about municipal training, and the air in the room shifted like a pan of oil when you tilt it. June folded her napkin into a neat little idiot of linen and said, sweet as poison, “I’m certified; would you like to see my whistle,” and Frank coughed the way men cough when they are applauding without making it a fight. My father laughed, too loud, like he had been granted permission to stay, and my mother put the gravy boat down with a soft thud that said, mind yourself.

After, in the kitchen where civility gets put into Tupperware, my father cornered me in front of the fridge, the one that sighs. “I saw your bit,” he said like he was confessing to a crime that tasted good. “The one where you say vagina.” He said it the way people say the name of a small country they haven’t practiced. I leaned against the counter and thought about all the doors I could walk through, including the one that leads to a fight I have rehearsed in a mirror. “What did you think,” I asked, because if he is going to hand me a knife I want the blade pointing the right way. He said, “I don’t think it’s a word for a stage,” and then, as if he had come to bring me news from my own life, “I hear you’re with—what is she to you,” and I said, “Mine,” with a calm I borrowed from a better version of myself. He smiled in that way men have when they are about to call you brave or selfish depending on whether your choice reflects on them and said, “That’s complicated,” and I said, “So is stuffing,” and he laughed because he knows stuffing and has never met complications head on. When he left, he touched my shoulder as if confirming he still owned part of it. June watched from the hall with the neutral alertness of a kindergarten teacher waiting to see which child’s hands are going to get jam on the wall.

Friday at Alma’s was a benediction disguised as coffee. Edite sat by the window with lipstick like a promise and watched the parade of relatives who are both audience and choir. She held our hands in a government-sanctioned turn-taking and told us where to stand in the house in case of an earthquake, which is the kind of instruction I will take from a woman who has negotiated car crashes and rehab and a nurse who doesn’t believe in second cups. We brought a pie that tried too hard—that was my mother’s phrase and she was right; it was earnest and showed its work and I wanted to give it an A for effort and then not eat it. Alma accepted it the way one accepts a donation of sixecounter spoons and made room on a table with a cloth that had known hands in another language. The cousins played a card game that used rules wider than the table; at one point a child announced herself the judge of spades and everyone complied as if she had been elected by mail.

In the corner of the room, as Edite told June how you have to talk to pain in a voice that makes it feel welcome but not at home, Alma leaned close to me and said, out of nowhere, “Do you ever regret you said it out loud,” and I knew she meant both the accident and the love and the stage. I said, “Only three times a day, which is down from forty,” and she laughed softly in a way that made me think about how women carry each other like purses full of things they never asked to hold. She told me her mother had started calling the bird with the broken wing by a name—a good name, a strong name you give to saints and girls who run far—and that when it came back, as it does, as they do, she was less angry and more appreciative of its confidence. “We should be so sure of our bad luck,” she said, and squeezed my forearm like agreement was a muscle.

On Saturday night I had a set in a bar in Warwick that looks like a diner got tired of coffee and decided to sell regret instead. The owner keeps his rosary behind the register and the TV is always on mute, a soap opera of men with hats at a table in a casino that barely moves. June sat at the back near the dartboard with Alma, because sometimes we are a three with edges that fit, and my mother surprised me by coming with a scarf wrapped around her like she was smuggling dignity. I did twenty minutes that were more knives than spoons and then I did the thing where I put down both and talk. I said, “I fell in love with the person the internet has a problem with,” and the men at the bar shifted like a boat when a wave hits from the side, and I said, “My mother is fine with it because she has no time for hypothetical problems, she has a chair to return to a rental place and two teeth to scare into compliance,” and my mother laughed, hand over mouth, as if she couldn’t help it, which is the sound I want the rest of my career to make. After, a woman from Coventry with hair that looked like a surprise touched my elbow and said, “Thank you for being out here saying there is a way to do this that doesn’t involve dying,” and I nodded and made a joke because I don’t know how to accept gratitude for breathing, and June kissed the back of my hand near the wrist, in public, in front of a dartboard, and that became another holiday we didn’t know to put on the calendar.

December arrived dressed like itself and apologizing. The first snow was a powder you could blow off your palm, and then the second one came wet and heavy as a rumor and hung itself off the trees in lumps. The puddle in the lot went stiff, then glass, then opaque, then beautiful, like some truth you don’t want to learn in front of company. The upstairs neighbor added, in chalk that held on under wet, ACCOUNTING IS OVER, INVENTORY BEGINS, and the plastic swans got scarves made from old socks like someone was tempting God. My mother bought us a space heater with a safety feature she explained three different ways to an audience of one and then texted later with a diagram in case I forgot what off looked like. Frank installed weather stripping with the focus of a man who believes in the moral arc of doors, and then showed me how to check the pilot light on the stove like I was a trainee in the family business of keeping ourselves from blowing up.

There was a morning the city lost power because the world has to remind you who owns the grid. The mill across the alley went quiet in a way that made the air look taller. Harbor Dawn looked different without electricity, as if it were an honest color for the first time. June and I did the thing immigrants and children do: we made the day work anyway. We moved the plant to the one spot where the light called it by name. We put soup on the stove like pioneers who could Venmo and cooked as if heat was a gift from a neighbor. Alma and Edite came with a thermos that could have fueled a truck and blankets with history in the weave, and my mother and Frank arrived with cards and opinions and a tealight production that suggested she had a side hustle as a monastery. We ate by candlelight not in a romantic way but in a winter way, face lit from below like we were telling ghost stories and the ghosts were ours. The cat walked the perimeter with his tail in a question mark and decided we were doing a ritual and approved. Someone suggested we go around and say one thing we were not afraid of anymore, and someone else said that was a trap, and we compromised the way we do by talking over each other and catching what was offered. I said I was less afraid of learning I can fail in rooms that are kind. June said she was less afraid of a thought being a fact. Edite said she was not afraid of walking to the window alone, and my mother said she was not afraid of calling a person’s superior when the first person tells her no, and Frank said he was not afraid of learning to let a thing be the way a thing is, and we all looked at him like we were seeing a magician do a trick with no sleeves.

When the power blinked back on the room looked uglier and more honest. The refrigerator sighed in relief like a coach with his back against a gym wall. Alma put her hand flat on the table and said, “We need a night like this on purpose in June,” because she has the mind of a person who schedules their salvation. We played cards and let the day empty its pockets on the floor and June put her feet in my lap like a prayer and I held one ankle with the kind of reverence I have not been taught by any religion but learned by touching something I could lose.

In the weeks between the first snow and Christmas, I got an email from a booker who has three names and an address that ends in dot tv and he asked me to come to New York on a Tuesday to do six minutes for a late-night producer who thinks Rhode Island might be a place where jokes grow wild. The date was the same as the winter concert at June’s school where she had a solo to conduct children into the right door and a whistle part that was, apparently, a musical choice and an institutional necessity. I told myself it was just a date on a calendar. I told myself I could be two places by believing in frictionless movement. I told myself, like a sinner, a good lie and wrote it on the whiteboard and decorated it with snowflakes because I am a coward in a cute hat. June came home with the glitter of someone else’s project stuck to her mouth and saw the word New York and then the day and then my face and made a small sound like a door closing gently. “Go,” she said, and I believed her tone, which is not always a wise choice. “I can ask Donna to take the front entrance and I can teach a fifth grader to blow a whistle for two minutes,” she added, which is not actually reversible math.

We bought a cheap bus ticket and a ham sandwich and a future argument in a bundle. On the morning of, I woke to the sound of salt trucks singing their municipal hymn and the cat doing his patrol with his tail in its brave question mark. I packed too much and then took half out and then put it back because I wanted choices even though choices are sometimes knives. June stood at the door wrapped in a scarf a cousin made in another year and put her palm on my cheek like she was checking whether I had a fever or a secret. “Do you want me to say don’t,” she asked, and I said, “I want you to say zucchini if the road goes up while I’m gone,” and she nodded because this is how we talk, in bridges and grocery lists. On the bus, a man behind me explained to his phone the nature of betrayal in a way that makes me think we will never run out of new words for old things. I rehearsed my six minutes in my head in front of the window that showed me Jersey like a story someone else wrote, and when I got to the part where I talk about the accident I stopped and did it without flair and moved on, which felt like walking around a hole and not falling.

The producer had the kind of haircut that happens to women who become brands. The room was smaller than the dream had been. Comics lined up with faces that had been trained to be ready to be loved. I did my six and a half and I did not die and I did not ascend and the woman with the haircut nodded and looked at her phone and I smiled at the night like I had been told a good rumor. After, a kid with upper arms like hope walked me to a pizza place and told me about Milwaukee and how he had gotten out and how he wanted to be seen by a camera that had paid taxes. I took the late bus home, because I drew a line through the word couch in my head and replaced it with bed and the woman I share it with, and at two a.m. I snuck into our apartment as if it were a church and I had a late confession. June slept with her hand on her face and the cat glared like I had missed curfew and there was a note on the table from my mother that said, “Call me when you wake up so I can pretend I didn’t stay up,” and I lay down and put my hand on the square inch of June’s back my palm knows like a map and felt the engine of her body doing its honest work.

In the morning she told me the concert had been ridiculous and good. A kid had lost a shoe and refused to perform because his foot could not be seen in a public setting without its partner, and a girl with a clarinet had cried because her reed had a secret and then played anyway and then cried again because she had now learned she did not need the reed to be obedient to be good. “Parents clapped like they invented hands,” she said, making coffee with the concentration of a chemist who only respects one outcome. “Donna blew the whistle and did not declare herself a goddess even though she was, which was professional restraint I hope I never have to exhibit.” I told her the woman with the haircut made a face that might be a yes later and we made pancakes badly and we fed them to each other with a level of flirtation that should come with an advisory for kitchens.

On a Sunday, we went to the Providence Athenaeum because sometimes you need to sit in a room that remembers how long humans have been writing apologies and pretending they are poems. The wooden shelves leaned like exhausted choir members and the busts looked down like bored jurors. We whispered even though no one told us to; whispering in the Athenaeum is one of those laws you’re born knowing if you are from here or have loved someone who is. June stood in the children’s section with her fingers on spines like she was reading braille and said, “There is a whole section for dragons,” with the same tone people use about real estate, and I took her hand and moved it to my mouth because I believe in showing gratitude to the library like it wasn’t an accident. We sat at a table with a view of a window with a view of snow trying hard, and I wrote a paragraph in a notebook about apology furniture and June drew me a picture of a stop sign with lips, and a woman at the next table smiled the kind of smile that says, I wish you well without needing to know your names.

The winter days were narrow and the nights roomy. We learned to preheat the car as a philosophical stance. We became the kind of people who carry sand in the trunk and a blanket and an extra set of mittens because your life becomes a series of better chances if you have three items and you know where they are. Onstage, I said less and meant more; offstage, I said more and meant less in the directions of polite uncles and former coworkers who had found my Instagram and wanted to be reassured that nobody was mad at them for their existence. June learned to say, at work and to herself, “I need a minute,” and to take it, and that small sentence became a spell I envied. Val assigned homework that looked like choosing a color a day and naming five things that were that color, which is how I came to know the blue of the line in the shower tile from nineteen eighty-three and the blue of Frank’s baseball cap faded to a memory of a wave and the blue of a bruise at day seven when it is leaving with a grace you don’t deserve.

On a Tuesday night, I did a set at the Grange for a group of vegans who laughed like they had been composting their jokes for months and now wanted to be fed. In the audience, to my surprise and not, was the cop from the accident, the door-faced man with the kindness he couldn’t recruit. Afterward he came up and said, “I brought my sister, she likes people who talk like they mean it,” and then he said, “She told me I should apologize for seeming like an authority when what I am is a person in a costume with paperwork,” and I said, “We all are,” and we stood awkwardly in front of a sculpture made out of beets and smiled like people who had stood in a night together and now were standing in a different one. He bought a donut and left me the receipt like a calling card because Rhode Island courts leave their mark in the strangest places.

Snow fell again and the city behaved like it had agreed to it. We went to India Point and watched the river have opinions about ice and then we walked until our noses argued and went home to the radiator’s sermon. On the way back we passed a boy dragging a Christmas tree down a sidewalk that had not agreed to cooperate, and he stopped, looked at us, and said, “It’s heavier than it looks,” and we said, “Everything is,” and he nodded, wise with sap and effort. I kept that nod like a coin in my pocket for when I needed to buy a moment’s courage. We hung a string of lights around the window in chaos and then straightened it with the kind of attention we usually reserve for bad news. The apartment smelled like oranges and salt and Harbor Dawn, and the world, on cue, did not stop for us, and I did not ask it to, and June fell asleep with a book on her chest about a dragon who refuses to be tamed by genre, and I lay awake and listened to the far-off freight train in Olneyville clearing its throat, and the mill fans coughing into duty, and the soft sound of the cat deciding to love our feet despite their record, and I thought, audit us, we are not afraid of paperwork; count our knives and our spoons and the vegetables we named and the ways we learned to drive without dying; list our holidays, our tealights, our bills; we will stand where you tell us and then an inch to the left because the light is better there, and because we know how to move without breaking a thing we can’t fix.January didn’t start so much as arrive already in progress, like we’d walked into a movie late and everyone in the theater had the decency not to turn around. The calendar my mother vandalized with greens and stars hung on our Harbor Dawn wall and made it look like optimism had reupholstered itself. The Bay of Reasonable Expectations turned into a plate of matte gray the cat did not trust and the swans acquired knit hats from an unknown hand, jaunty in a way that made me want to pay taxes. I decided to inventory without telling anyone; it’s a family sport, but it’s also how I defang my dread. The inventory looked like a list written in the margins of a cookbook: things we could do in a power outage, words that worked better than sorry, intersections that make us lift our shoulders for no reason we can explain to a map, the names of people who, when they say your name, make you stand up straighter without looking at your feet.

The first week, the city suffered that kind of cold that gives thin things a voice. The radiator monologued; the old mill coughed its, “I’m here”; Frank’s truck did a morning aria that offended two sparrows and a man in a hat. June and I put our lives on low heat and let them simmer. Therapy turned blue and then lima-bean green as Val assigned colors like chores. “What’s something green that is not a plant,” she asked, and June came home and we went around our apartment like burglars looking for a very specific proof and found the stripe of tape on the battery drawer, the side of a toolbox Frank left because leaving things is how he shows he cares, the faded dinosaur sticker on the back of a picture frame, the stamp on a cardboard box we told ourselves we’d recycle when it stopped being useful as a table. “Okay,” she said, satisfied not with the answer but with the fact of answering, “I can get through the stoplight if I can name a thing. I can get through a thought if it has a color.” I wrote that down not because I thought I would forget but because writing is how I get the words to believe me.

The landlord replaced the front door to our building with a door that believed in weather, and everything felt a degree more possible. On nights when snow forgot which direction it had come from, June would come in with her hat tilted and her whistle tucked into her vest like a secret she could take out if the kitchen needed direction. “They’re doing a Dr. Seuss unit,” she said of the first graders one evening, shoulders lowering as the smell of soup tried to be a blanket. “Everyone rhymes and a kid used the word wife in a sentence like a threat because he has heard it deployed that way. I told him we could use partner until he’s thirty-five.” We sat at the table and made tax preparation look like an art installation, receipts under magnets, a pen my mother calls reliable, a calculator whose solar panel refuses to admit winter is a thing. We made a small stack labeled Let’s Ask Frank and a larger stack labeled Let’s Lie and then did the third thing, which was text Alma to see who in her network of women who bend systems into usefulness knew a tax preparer who would not try to charm June into buying a product with all vowels. “I have a cousin with a storefront that looks like a laundromat,” she wrote back. “She scares the IRS by being correct.”

The first big fight came without an appointment, which is the only way our fights feel real. I did a set at a place in Fox Point that solves its bad lighting by pretending mystery is a décor choice. It was a small room, the kind where your breath becomes community property and everyone shares one laugh like a scarf. I tried a new piece about how we named our panic after a vegetable, about how words can be bridges and traps and props, and the room was so kind I let it push me further out on the beam than my feet know how to hold. I said “the night on Broad” like I owned a patent and took a breath in the wrong place and the bit felt like the way a chair goes when one leg is an inch short, and I corrected, but the correction involved saying June’s job and the name of the rickety stoplight that has its own theology. A woman at the back nodded with that urgency of a person who collects resonances like coupons. After, a kid with a channel terrible at privacy put thirty seconds of me on the internet. “You were brave,” he wrote as a caption next to a clip where I am funny, but the sound underneath is a siren my body knows.

June saw it because the internet’s hobby is finding the one thing your body would rather it didn’t. She was in bed with socks on, which is always a red flag, and I came in with tea that didn’t need me. She held out the phone and my face did that thing my face does when it meets its own work in the wild, which is try to walk backward out of its own skull. “It’s good,” she said, evenly, which I understood, in our dialect, to mean I see what you were doing, and I am registering my admiration for your muscle. Then she said, because she comes from people who can talk while the pan is still hot, “Do the children you said you can hear from three blocks away need their parents to know the name of the light?” The worst part was that she didn’t say it like a slam. She said it like we were planning a route and my map had a point it didn’t need.

I told her about the room, about how the chairs were better than the other chairs, about the way laughter can trick a person into thinking honesty is free. “It isn’t,” she said, tired and not angry, which is a more dangerous mood for us because anger has rituals and this is just water running where it wants. “I know you’re paying with your good,” she added, which was unkind only to the ceiling. “But sometimes you pay with both of ours.” We were quiet for a long minute that felt too expensive to keep. I stared at Harbor Dawn and thought about how easy it is to mistake a color for a permission slip. Finally, I said, because the joke failed and the truth might not, “I don’t want to make you into inventory you didn’t volunteer for.” She put the phone down on her stomach like it had become familiar to her and reached for my hand. “You’re allowed to tell them we survived,” she said. “You are even permitted to be impressive about the survival if that buys you bread. But maybe not the name of the light.” We made a rule and wrote it on a piece of paper big enough for both our sincerity: no street names, no children specifics, no whistle gossip, no accident details that could be put into a police report. My mother came by the next day with stickers and added, in glitter letters, “exceptions only for dragons,” and we let her because a rule without a joke at the bottom will break.

The producer with the haircut emailed on a Tuesday as if Tuesdays were authorized for big news. “Not this batch,” she wrote, next to a smile that looked like a sticker on a child’s chart. “Keep us posted.” I stared at those five words long enough to translate them into three dialects: one where I was lucky to be in the inbox at all, one where she is being kind so I don’t curse her name at breakfast, and one where I am already walking toward the next room. I told June on the corner when she had a second between corralling a boy in a dinosaur hoodie and convincing a minivan that a crosswalk is a law, not a suggestion. “Good,” she said, without a trace of charity. “More practice, fewer haircuts,” and then blew her whistle with a music I had learned to hear as a sentence.

My father remembered my number in January. Or he found it somewhere in the papers he keeps in the glove compartment because he doesn’t trust wallets. He called to ask if I wanted to come to a thing in a basement that involved spaghetti and men his age making jokes about cholesterol while sharing a bowl of salad that made the point of salad and missed the pleasure of it. “It’s for charity,” he said, and the way he said the word made me think of a girl who had annoyed him in middle school. I went because guilt is a religion with a good choir and because nobody regrets watching a man in a hairnet ladle sauce over noodles like absolution. He introduced me to three different people as “the comedian” and I kept wanting to say “person,” which is not a joke, which is why I didn’t say it. On the drive home, he asked if I was still “doing the thing with the girl,” and I thought about the list on the wall with names that look like ingredients and decided I could, just for one car ride, pretend he was trying. “Yes,” I said. “And we are good in the way that used furniture sometimes lasts longer than new.” He pretended to understand and then told me a story about a boat he almost bought named Patience and I tried not to take it as advice.

Edite began to walk farther than the length of a hallway, which in the winter is a distance many people do not attempt. Alma sent videos of her mother reciting the names of the birds that make Providence tolerable. She counted grackles like a woman counting change and disrespected a gull with the subtlety of a poet. We went for a slow walk along South Water when the ice had the decency to stay in its lane, and Edite touched the railing with a hand that knew railings and said she had decided, arbitrarily and therefore valiantly, that the bird with the broken wing was named after her sister who makes jam without measuring. “It makes me less annoyed when it comes back,” she said, and I believed her because naming a thing is a way to let disappointment in the door without offering it coffee.

In the middle of a cold snap that made light brittle, the school did a lockdown drill that June did not get to opt out of. She texted me only after, which is the kind of kindness I didn’t know to ask for. “We hid in the supply closet,” she wrote, and I saw her in the dark in a narrow room holding two small hands and the whistle doing nothing on its cord. When I met her at the curb, her mouth was a shape I now recognize and her laugh was hiding under the seat. “Tell me something yellow,” she said before I could say how are you, and I said, too loud, “The sticky note on your desk, the middle of an egg, the line on the curb nobody respects,” and she exhaled in a way that made the car less of a car and more of a ship that had remembered how to be a floor. At home, we instituted a rule where the first person through the door after a day like that goes to the sink and washes their hands up to the elbows like a surgeon and tells the water what could have gone wrong, and the second person stands and listens like the air needs instructions.

I became precise about my jokes the way a person becomes precise about their knives after a cut. I made myself read the sentences out loud in the kitchen to see which ones made the light change. I retired three bits that had become too easy and started a story that used furniture as apology and let it end ragged because endings that insist they are clean get dust on them faster. Onstage I said “my person” and didn’t say “my plan,” and it was good for me to leave some angles unoffered. I put new words in the mouth of the zucchini bit and gave June veto power with the speed of a red pen. It made me slower, it made me better, it made me peer with a flashlight into places I had previously lit with neon.

The calendar somebody made for the comedy families said there was a festival in March, one of those winter-we’re-almost-done-with-you events where the rooms are heated by a combination of space heater, bodies, and denial. There was a slot where you could do thirty minutes in a bookshop in Wickenden that smells like a priest fell asleep under a pile of cookbooks. I wanted it not because it was big but because the room was going to be full of people who come into heat by listening. “Take it,” June said, immediately, because she enjoys watching me perform for people who think reading is foreplay. Then she squinted at the date and did that math we do now with both love and logistics. “It’s the day of the car seat clinic,” she said, which is an event at the school where professionals check whether parents’ best efforts are aligned with physics. “I asked Donna to stay late,” she added before I could divvy up my want into parts. “We can both hang around things that keep people alive.”

My mother started a group chat called Calendar Or Else and added every woman she knew who kept a pen between her teeth when asked a question. Alma, June’s mother, my aunt who believes in lists the way other people believe in saints, Donna from the corner, Val even though that violated a patient confidentiality vibe by association, and a neighbor who has quietly run the block’s logistics since the nineties. It looked like nonsense at first, a chorus of dates and times and a dozen different ways of writing “Tuesday” that seemed to be a referendum on vowels. Then it turned into a thing with structure and humor, which is to say it became a place I wanted to stand in. “Remind me to defrost the sauce,” June’s mother wrote, which is our family’s way of saying everything that matters in one line. “Don’t do Harbor Dawn if you are feeling fragile,” my mother wrote, and I laughed and then realized she was talking about the actual wall and the desire to lean our heads, and cried a little in front of a trash can. The neighbor wrote, “The plow guy is late,” which is always the gospel, and Alma wrote, “I have extra jam,” which is both literal and proof that we have made it through something.

On a Thursday that was more tedious than dramatic, a kid at June’s school ran into the street. It wasn’t a moment that had to be told to a judge; it was a moment that, had you seen it, would have just joined the parade of times you almost watched a love story you don’t know close early. June held up both hands and the car did what cars sometimes do when a woman in a vest tells them to behave: it stopped like it had the decency to feel guilty. The kid cried and then laughed and then asked if he got a sticker for not dying. “I gave him two,” June said later, the couch pressing us into a conversation we didn’t have to start because the day had kindly written it for us. “One that says YOU DID GREAT and one that says BECAUSE THE ADULTS WERE HERE.” We sat there long enough to turn the couch into a place you would take a friend to see your life and then she said, “I don’t want you to stop telling them what happened. I just want you to stop saying what could happen next.” I knew exactly what she meant and I folded the sentence up and put it in my mouth for later.

We drove to Scituate on a Sunday to look at a reservoir like it was a documentation of restraint. The ice had its own narrative and the sign had a tone like an aunt telling you to undo yourself with mercy. We walked until the tips of our fingers remembered they were for touching and then went home because no walk makes you less responsible for the sink. On the way, we passed two men in orange hats standing in a shallow creek like they had decided the only way to be friends was cold water and patience. “Why do people fish when they don’t want the fish,” I asked, and June said, “To practice waiting,” and then reached for my hand in a way that told me we were not going to discuss it further because we were practicing waiting too.

At a show in Cranston, I met a woman at the bar who worked with my father in the way that people in Rhode Island work with each other, which is to say she knows how he takes his coffee and how his face looks when he gets away with a joke. She said the sentence that always changes the temperature in me three degrees: “He’s proud of you.” She didn’t say he said it to her or that she overheard him say it to a man whose opinion he respects about boats. She said it like a weather report, hands wrapped around a beer that had half-froze on the way from the cooler to the bar. I put my glass down and felt my hands do not tremble, which is the exact definition of age. “He knows we’re real,” I said, because if we were in a fairy tale that would be the correct next question. She nodded like she kept lists too and said, “He does, in the way he knows the ocean is there whether or not he goes.” I went home and told June in the tone you use to describe a bruise that has stopped being tender, and she said, “Good,” and we went on to the grocery list because love is an economy with limited labor hours.

On a day when the air forgot to be mean, I looked out at the Bay of Reasonable Expectations and saw that someone had chalked a hopscotch next to it with the numbers running from one to eleven and then, instead of twelve, a square labeled KEEP GOING. It made me ridiculous. I took a photo and sent it to everyone on Calendar Or Else and my mother replied, “Some child has a promising future in management,” and Alma replied with a picture of Edite’s cane standing in the corner like a coatrack and the caption, “She walked to the end of the hall and insulted a nurse for asking if she was tired,” and my aunt replied with a video of the dog trying to hopscotch in place because he respects rules but does not believe in gravity. June got home and put her bag down and kissed me in a way that told me the day had been the kind that needed the good parts underlined. We ate something with butter the way a woman I respect in another century recommends, and then we cleaned up like we do, passing plates back and forth like a different kind of prayer.

A letter came from a lawyer with an inclination toward adjectives. It used words like resolved and satisfied, which are always jokes when paper says them. The civil piece of the thing with the cars became something we could put in a file with tabs. June read it and made a face as if someone had put a salad dressing on the wrong salad and said, “I’m going to take a shower,” which is code for I will be back when my thoughts have laid down. I sat at the table and looked at Harbor Dawn until I could see the brushstrokes; if you get close enough to most things, the hands are right there. She came back with hair like a sermon and handed me a towel even though I had not gotten wet. “It is over in the way a letter can end a weather system,” she said, and I nodded like we were two people whose job it is to recognize the truth before it pretends it’s wearing a suit.

We started a tradition that makes sense only to us and therefore is likely a real tradition. On Saturdays, if nobody needed us for a ceremony or a door, we took the long way to the farmers’ market that keeps insisting winter is harvest by selling root vegetables like proof. We bought carrots that looked like ambition and beets that looked like bad decisions and peaches from a man who believes it is never the wrong season for optimism. We picked a word for the week that was not zucchini so as not to spend it all in one place. It had to be a thing we could say in front of people and a thing I could put in a sentence without making it a bit. One week it was rosemary because the neighbor was cooking like it was his job and the hallway smelled like condolences and delight. Another week it was thermos because everyone we love has learned to carry heat. We used it at the light, we used it when my mouth started to get sharp, we used it when the whistle was a knife, and we built ourselves a small bridge out of kitchen words and transit.

The night before the bookstore set, I did that thing where you clean a room that doesn’t need it because the part of your brain that makes order onstage prefers an external tableau to match. June watched me put pens in a cup and then take them out and then put them back and then laughed like you do when someone you love is practicing witchcraft with stationery. “Tell your apology furniture,” she said, signing a permission slip with a pen my mother would approve of. “We’ll move the couch when you get home.” It made me want to weep how much infrastructure we had built out of things you can carry and words you can write on the back of your hand. At the reading, a woman in the front row took notes like she was going to send them to someone in prison and I wanted to ask if I could contribute. I told the story about a chair that’s always in the wrong place, about how sorry can take up a corner you need to pass through to the room where breakfast happens, about how we decided it could live in the hallway if it helped anyone else find their jacket. When I finished, the room had a sound I have learned to respect: it did not rush to fill itself. Afterwards, a guy with a used-to-be-punk posture said, “Thank you for not giving me a lesson,” and I almost hugged him and then did not because bookstores have their own rules about touch.

Later, home, Harbor Dawn doing its quiet job and the cat making his patrol like the night had secrets, June sat on the floor with her back against the couch we threaten to move and said, “Do you think we’re done with zucchini,” with the tenderness you use when discussing retirement. I shook my head because the part of me that trusts nothing wanted to hoard it. “Maybe we give it a vacation,” I said, and made myself smile, because sometimes you have to trick your face into practicing what you want your heart to do. “Send it to a place with a porch. Let it come back when we forget and need it in a sentence.” She nodded. “We can schedule its return in Calendar Or Else,” she said, and then added, in a tone that took the sting out of everything, “Dragons are exempt.” We laughed until the laugh turned into a different sound, the kind that lives between the cleaner and the gross, the part of a day where the good was already so good you could spend some.

It snowed that night in a way that made the city forgiving. In the morning the Bay of Reasonable Expectations turned into a mirror with opinions and someone had chalked along the edge a long list of words that were not instructions and were not poetry and were, I decided, directions disguised as both: peppermint, overpass, window crank, mittens on radiators, receipts, beets, Harbor, thermos, inventory, rosemary, whistle, porch. The chalk had been written by a hand that knows this block, the handwriting of a person who has carried groceries in a storm and found a way to hold the door open with a knee. We added one, because it felt like the law: settle, in my handwriting that still looks like I’m trying to convince a substitute teacher I am good. Then we went inside, took off all our layers like they were lies we could unlearn, and made eggs, and ate them at the table we bought in a store that sells families to people with a van, and if anyone had asked me then what the word for that day was, I would have said, with a confidence I am not always entitled to, home.
