In Wollongong the mornings arrive salt-sticky, a whitish light puddled on corrugated roofs and the long low moan from the steelworks like an animal sleeping somewhere you can’t quite see. In those mornings, when the gulls racket over the Blue Mile and the escarpment stands behind you like a hulk of green-brown spine, a man can decide what kind of gentleman he is. I polished my shoes even when there was nowhere particular to be. I buttoned shirts like spells. I washed out my teacups until the porcelain squeaked. The habit of care kept me tethered, it kept me from loosening into a blunted shape.

The locals called me Rambone, which sounded like a joke until it didn’t. Schoolyard names have a long afterlife. It was short for Raymond Bonner, or so the story went, compressed by time and the soft drag of vowels into a name that carried shoulders with it. I never much minded. It made strangers smile, and I liked being an occasion for that. A gentleman isn’t defined by his cutthroat shave, anyway, or whether his cuffs show just so. It’s a private vow: I will not make a dent where I stand. I will pay attention. I will write thank-you notes for small mercies.

Across the veranda, the jasmine grew like it had something to prove. Beyond the low fence, the street sloped down toward the sea, toward the wind that has pebbles in it. On the morning she moved in, I sat on the steps with a cup of tea and a newspaper that was mostly advertisements and funerals. A small hatchback purred up the road, scraped a tyre against the kerb, and went quiet. She stepped out, hair tied up badly with a kitchen elastic, a box in her arms labeled Books: by which she meant anchors. A cloud of lorikeets arrived to witness, a showy jury in green and blue.

“Morning,” I called, my voice trying for easy and landing somewhere near careful.

She looked over, eyes narrowed against the light. “Is that what it is? Thought it was too noisy for morning.”

Her laugh happened like a hiccup. She braced the box against her hip, and I could see the spine of a battered Penguin, orange sunbleached to apricot. On the side of another box: Plates!!! handle gentle (please). She wore black sneakers with paint dots on the toes.

I rose. “Do you need a hand? I have two of them.”

“Thank you,” she said, extraordinary politeness pushing past exasperation. “I’m Nerida.”

The name pulled something through me like a fish-hook dragging thread. Nerida. Sea-nymph. A local name, but it sounded bright even in the day’s grey. I lifted one of the boxes—light, for all its Books—and followed her up the front steps with a smuggled sense of permission. Inside, the rented air was cool, shaded by cream blinds and the ghost-lines where someone had once hung pictures.

“Kitchen that way,” she said, establishing our direction. “Bedrooms... I’ll work it out. You live next door?”

I nodded. “They call me Rambone. It’s a long story with a short plot.”

She snorted. “You don’t look like a brawler.”

“Nor a bone,” I agreed, and set the box down on the counter. I took in the space without staring. It’s a talent that comes with practice: seeing without making anyone feel seen-through. There were two cups by the sink, still wrapped in newspaper, and a jar of Vegemite that had cracked lid plastic, adhesive bandage around its throat. Home is what you make on a knife edge.

Back and forth we carried things while the day warmed. A lamplight shade like an upturned skirt. A stack of plates that breathed chalk dust. I saw the dent in the rear quarter panel of her car and the small stuffed magpie on her dashboard, its beak dented by time, like a years-old joke told too often. She explained that the landlord replaced the stove but not the taps. She made a face at the bathroom’s salmon tiles. She said she’d get used to it. People always do. We shrink to fit our spaces or learn to expand them with noise.

Around midday, I excused myself and went to the kitchen to plate something. The bread was fresh—Mrs. Khan at the corner bakery set aside a loaf for me if I was late in the mornings—and the lemons on my bench came from the old Greek man down the street, Mr. Kosta, who hated waste worse than bad weather. I sliced bread, buttered it, squeezed the lemon over sugar in a saucer, made little wedges like my mother had for us on days the heat rattled against the flyscreens. I carried them in on a chipped blue plate, a sort of peace offering, or allegiance, or just a tray of sugar and kindness.

She looked at the plate like it was treasure. “You didn’t have to.”

“Gentleman’s code,” I said, quietly, and the term pealed ridiculous in my head, like church bells for a plastic wedding.

We ate standing up, sugar scattering to the floor tiles like the tiniest snow, and she told me about herself in a way that sounded like handing over receipts. She worked at the hospital, nights mostly, in a ward that smelled like antiseptic and orange cordial. She liked late movies with bad special effects and old recipes that use condensed milk. She had left a share-house in Corrimal, full of musicians and mould, and she was hoping for: something. Peace, maybe. A setup where rest could happen. She gestured at the empty living room, the clean lint of it. “It’s going to echo for a while.”

“It will fill,” I said. “Things have a habit of becoming themselves.”

She considered me out of the corner of her eye. “You don’t talk like a bloke who swears at the telly.”

“I save my curses for better occasions,” I said, and she laughed softly, gently, like not to drop anything.

In the weeks that followed, we became neighbours in the old way. We learned to knock by leaning over the side fence and saying hey. I pegged notes to her clothesline when I went to the market. She put jars on my back steps after late shifts—apricot jam with the lid slightly askew, a spoon standing upright like a flag. In the afternoons, the sun did that thing where it lay low and turned everyone’s face into a painting, and we stood beneath the bottlebrush bush and talked about nothing that was also everything. Mr. Kosta muttered about us, good-natured, and gave us tomatoes that tasted of earth and a slow mood.

One night she knocked on my door with two coffees and a look like she was trying to be brave about not being brave. I’d been at my table, writing. The page held lined corridors, faint, precise. The words mostly stayed where I put them, but sometimes they leaked out and pooled around my elbows. I wiped my fingers on a cloth as if ink could stain more than a day.

“Can I... is this okay?” she asked, and slipped in when I stepped aside.

We sat at the table in the wobbly dark, the cheap bulb overhead throwing a yellow shoulder of light. She looked better in shadows, in the sense of relief it gave her face. Tiredness is cruel. It lays out all the soft parts and labels them. She sipped her coffee. It smelled like petrol and toffee.

“Rough shift?” I asked.

She nodded. “A man with a knotted face told me I was an angel, and then he told me I was the devil, and then he cried because the machine beeped too fast. I wanted to hold all his badness like a hot rock and then throw it into the sea. But we’re not allowed to do burials from the ward.”

“Probably in the manual,” I said, and she leaned forward, elbows on the table, her lip twitching.

“You’re a funny one,” she said. “I haven’t worked you out.”

“I’m entirely ordinary. The trick is in the jacket.”

She looked around my small rooms, at the tidy rows of books, the too-straight chairs, the stove I polished because I liked things to do what they promised. The window above the sink had a grille—not bars, not really, just a sort of protective mesh—and it patterned the night into squares. The breeze pressed the curtain against it, as if the house were breathing through teeth.

“What do you do?” she said, finally. “When you leave your gentleman post.”

“I write,” I said, which was true, mostly. “Bits. A kind of ledger.”

“For money?”

“Not in any measurable amount. I also look after small things,” I added, which was not untrue: boots, a plant, a borrowed cat named Mesmer that stared at me like I stole its name.

She tried to see me as a writer and then couldn’t quite. I suspect I didn’t look like a person who made anything but tea. Out the window, a siren whinnied and dropped into quiet, the sound sliding off the hill. We kept our silence like a coin.

When it rained, she wore a yellow slicker too bright to make sense. She crossed the path between our doors carrying a colander like a spangled crown. She said she was making pasta e ceci because she needed to be reminded of fractions, of how one thing becomes parts and then makes itself whole again. I pretended to know what she meant and then—later, hours later, when the pot had gone empty and the rain stopped briefly like someone holding their breath—I understood and didn’t.

We walked some. From the lighthouse to the old fort, past kids on bikes playing at speed. Over to Puckeys and back, where the creek pulled like a lazy arm against its banks. We let the salt take our ankles. On Crown Street I pretended to shop with purpose and she watched the buskers with the respect owed to endurance. The two of us in the world looked like any pair of people who have found a way to occupy the same air.

“Do you drive?” she asked me once, when we paused at a pedestrian crossing. A van rolled past slow, its exhaust a small curtain.

“I prefer walking,” I said. “Feet don’t forget where they are.”

She flicked her keys in her hand, a nervous habit that made metal light. “I like driving,” she said, but a blush rose up her throat like rainwater in a pipe. “Sometimes. Not at night. Or in the wet. Or when I think about what could go wrong.”

“You’re careful,” I said.

“I’m afraid,” she corrected. “But it looks the same if you don’t watch too closely.”

The street smelled like hot coins. A child across the way blew bubbles that rose and popped and became nothing at all. It’s funny how things that are briefly beautiful avoid leaving a trace. Others—well, they leave nothing but.

Once, in the late afternoon, I watched her on her front step with her hands clean and empty, staring at nothing, the way some people look at a fire or a wall. I didn’t say her name because calling it might have hunted the moment away. The lacework of the veranda cast patterns across her knees. She seemed bright and dimming in alternating bands. I understood wanting to be loved and not knowing where to put one’s hands for it to happen.

Later, she stepped over the fence instead of walking around. “Shortcut,” she said. “Sorry if I’m treading on your rosemary.”

“It likes to be bothered,” I said. “It makes it smell itself.”

She stood very close. I could see the fleck of green paint on her ear where she had leaned against a wall. The day was sliding into evening. The steelworks began its labor-sound, that inhale of industry. The escarpment held its breath.

“I had a thorn of a day,” she admitted, voice small. “It is barely in my skin but I know it’s there.”

“Come sit,” I offered, my chair a declaration of truce. “I boiled the kettle in anticipation of your defeat.”

She smiled at how earnestly I said it. “The novel where every scene begins with tea,” she said. “Who would read it?”

“People who like their joys warm,” I said, and filled her cup.

If I was a gentleman it was in my attention to what people do with their cups. She held hers by the bowl, knuckles blanching, the way someone holds heat to prove something. She told me about the ward, about a child who climbed the curtain and sing-sang in a language of her own making, about a woman whose daughter brought a clumsy bouquet from the servo and called it beautiful until it was true. She told me the speed machines beep at in the quiet middle of the night, that they perform their own anxious song in the dark. I told her about Mr. Kosta’s tomatoes, about the kid down the block who kept practicing kickflips and almost had it now, almost. I told her I once tried to make lamingtons and instead created a damp brown sorrow. We laughed a little.

It didn’t happen all at once. Love hardly ever does; it is a kind of moss. It fans out over surfaces, a quiet green claiming. It climbs up brick. It wrinkles into the cracks in your hours. It was in the way she left her sandals on my rug as if planning to come back. It was in how she texted me pictures of weird cloud shapes that looked like dogs and once like a ship on fire. It was the note she stuck to my kettle that read: Boil me. Boil me for all you’re worth. It was the umbrella she left at the bus stop, and the day I brought it home to her like retrieving a lost fisherman.

One evening she found the single photograph I keep on top of the bookshelf, tucked between two volumes of poetry nobody borrows. It shows me standing in a suit too big for my shoulders, the city behind me like cardboard, my father’s hand on my shoulder in a way that says both possessive and awkward. She touched the edge of the frame with a fingernail. “How old were you?”

“Younger,” I said, a stupid answer. “Around twenty. Trying to look like twenty-nine.”

“Did it work?”

“For a day,” I said. “Maybe two.”

She smiled at me then. It was slow. It moved through her face like a tide ending a drought. I thought about leaning in and did not. A gentleman is not a coward, but he knows the weight of a moment that should be carried into another room and unwrapped carefully. My mouth tasted of toothpaste I hadn’t used yet.

At night, I wrote. The desk was old, the kind that is used to stubbornness. I lined up my pencils and my rules. I turned the lamp so the light fell in a square and then I kept adjusting it, it not being quite right. In the quiet, other noises showed themselves—neighbours shutting drawers; a bin lid settling with a hollow chuck; something that could have been a possum or a drunk idea scrabbling at the roof. I wrote about a man with a name like a dare. I wrote about a small town that was, except it wasn’t. I wrote about a woman whose name meant sea and how she arrived like a change of weather and how his hands didn’t know where to put themselves. I wrote until my knuckles cramped. I wrote to prove that a thing could be put on a page and therefore be less dangerous than when it is simply moving around inside a body.

Sometimes I went for a walk without leaving my chair. This is to say: memory took me. There is a park in Fairy Meadow with benches that splinter your thighs if you sit too hard, and a’ll the same I sat, waiting for a bird that never came. There is a stretch of black road, dark like it was repaved yesterday, that takes you up past where the ambulances sit in their pen, calm and coiled. There is a white line painted thick enough to catch your eye. I tried to write a street without traffic and failed. Somewhere, always, a car is going somewhere. Somewhere, always, someone is late, or eager, or trying to outrun a feeling.

We went to the market together in the early mornings when the stalls were groggy and the boxes under the tables looked like they might yawn. She pointed at peaches like she was choosing jewels. She sniffed a melon and decided it could be hers. A man with a beard and a spinning sign offered us deals like magic tricks. I kept my hands light and left with more than I needed. We met a woman who sold soap that smelled of lemongrass and cut grass and a word I couldn’t say. Nerida bought three bars and then gave one to me without looking at my face as she handed it over. Gifts handed without letting the hands meet are a certain kind of trust.

We avoided certain streets without saying why. The ones with heavy traffic. The ones with unkind timing on their lights. It’s all in the shrug, the way she would say, “Let’s go this way. The jacarandas are better,” and we would. There was a boy with a skateboard, Finn, hair in his eyes like he didn’t know about scissors. He almost, almost landed a trick and in his almos we said yes, it counts. It counts. We named a dog that didn’t belong to us. We weather-watched like sailors. Sometimes she took the old Corolla down to the shops and I stood on my step and made a habit of watching her pull into her spot again. She reversed twice most times. Her breath looked like prayer in the winter months. She made the wheel small inside her hands.

“Do people think you’re strange?” she asked me one night, almost cheerful about it, as if the question were a compliment.

“Only those who have taken the trouble to think me at all,” I said.

“I don’t think you’re strange,” she said. “I think you are tidy in the wrong places.”

“Perhaps.”

“You can’t fold fear,” she said, almost to herself. “It doesn’t help.”

We sat then and listened to the slow scrape of a broom somewhere, the shuffle of someone older than the sound. I wanted to ask her about the dent in her car. She wanted to tell me about a dream in which she drove and drove and arrived nowhere there was anyone. She told me, instead, about a man in her ward who had walked into a fire and then lived. “I had to keep imagining his future skin,” she said. “Otherwise I couldn’t handle the present of it.”

“We’re built for later,” I said.

“Sometimes,” she said. “Sometimes we’re only good at before.”

The air in the house had that ingress of salt again. I wanted to open all the windows. The mesh over them shone in the lamplight like chain-mail. A small, practical protection, nothing dramatic. I fingered the catch and let it go.

There were other people too. Dot from the op shop, with hair like a cloud sitting down. She taught me to roll silk without creasing it and liked me more than she should. A lad named Corey who made deliveries on his bike, late, always apologizing into the wind. He brought me a parcel once that had already been opened and resealed with tape that said Sorry in red. Letter from no one, contents missing. I said thank you anyway. The old addict on the corner who sold coins from a tattered album and told me a long story about a Norwegian five-krone that had saved his life. Mrs. Khan, who gave me a paper bag full of broken biscuits. I ate them with Nero—Nerida, but I had taken to calling her names that changed shape between my teeth—and we laughed with crumbs in our mouths like children caught with their hands in what passed for a jar.

We were making a world one small thing at a time. The trick with love, when it begins late and carefully, is that you can start anywhere and have it be the beginning. Once, we went down to the beach at night. The ocean sounded like someone sleeping with intention. The metal rail by the steps was cold enough to be frank about it. She took off her shoes without telling me what she was thinking. The moon sat up there like a plate someone had left on top of the fridge and forgotten. I looked at the line of her, dark against the water’s tossing sheet, and my mind made a picture I wanted to keep. She turned and said something and the wind took an important word and set it down where I couldn’t reach. We laughed about it, and for days I thought about all the words you shouldn’t say at the mercy of wind. Yes. Stay. Help.

Once, she told me about a stranger she’d seen at the servo, stumbling in circles, trying to figure out which way light went in his head. “His face looked like it was pretending to be a face,” she said. “You know? Like a mask smell after a party. He bought a bottle of water and stared at it like it could teach him something.”

“Maybe it could,” I said. “Names are little prayers. Water goes to water, and so on.”

“You’d make a good priest,” she said with a smile too quick. “Or a con-man.”

“Same shoes,” I said, and we smiled, but the image stayed—some unknown man with a confusion built into his body—and it made the air feel less dependable. She took my hand then with the casualness of someone reaching for a dishcloth. I didn’t say anything. We walked like that for the length of one block and then she let go, as if she’d remembered she was holding something that might boil.

In the small hours sometimes, the noise would begin. A whistle, distant. The slam of a gate somewhere. The scrape of boots. It was only the city being itself, I told myself, the nocturne of practicalities. A person learns to hang their ghosts on local nails. We want all our hauntings to make sense. I got used to counting to four on my fingers, then to sixteen, for no reason I could explain. A habit is just a way of keeping your insides organized.

“Come to the markets with me on Saturday?” she said, a week or so later, as if we had not already planned to be in the same space at almost the same time. There was a nervousness in how she asked, like we had suddenly legalized something we had been doing informally.

“Of course,” I said. “I will get the plums that make your teeth ache unless you let them sit.”

She smiled. “I don’t like waiting.”

“I know,” I said. “We will find the impatient ones together.”

We met at the corner and pretended it was by accident. The sun had that empty blue that makes shadows look like drawstrings. I carried her bag because I like carrying things, because it gives the arms a task, because it makes men look useful in the way they want. She didn’t argue, not because she was polite but because she could see it made me comfortable and she had a feeling for the comfort of others like some people have an ear for birds. On the way back a small boy ran into her legs, almost knocking our carrots to the ground. His father scolded him without looking. Nerida crouched and said, “Hey. Are you okay?” and the boy nodded, a hard yes from his whole chest, and ran on. She watched him go with an expression that might have been nostalgia if she’d ever been a small boy. It was something else. It was: I will be in the business of catching people until I can’t.

In those days, the city held itself like a breath. The hills were green because winter had been wet. The ocean was that particular blue that looks like a photograph of itself. Up near the steelworks, the stack exhaled a white that became nothing by the time it reached us, but it still made the birds veer a little, as if the air had a shape you couldn’t see. Nerida’s car developed a new sound and then another; I pretended not to hear them. We both knew they were there. She drove with the radio at a certain volume to cover the nicks. The dash lights at night were small planets she made into a sky. When she reversed into her spot I could see the attention she put into being correct; I loved that nerve in her body, that strictness against chaos. I wanted to promise her that the world would reward it. You know it won’t. But you say it with your hands anyway.

One night, late, she came without warning. I hadn’t lit the lamp yet. She stood just inside my doorway like she wasn’t sure if the threshold required a pledge. The hall light from the building made a shape across her shoulder, a band of gold, like someone had underscored her.

“I had a dream,” she said.

“Everyone does,” I said softly.

“It was loud,” she said, as if that were the dream’s point. “It had brakes in it. It had... you know how songbirds sometimes attack their own reflection? It had that in it. But with more metal.”

I guided her to the chair. I sat opposite, hands in plain sight. “Tell me only the thread of it,” I said. “Not every knot.”

“I was driving the same street three times,” she said in a voice like someone explaining a recipe for a cake that can’t be eaten. “Three nights. Always a person appears at the corner of my eyes. Always I stop. The last time I couldn’t stop. It was like the road wasn’t interested in being road. And then—after—the dream refused to show me anything. Like it was ashamed of itself.”

“You don’t have to drive that street,” I began, but she shook her head briskly.

“It wasn’t any street,” she said. “It was a place inside my head where brakes didn’t work. I woke up and the room kept moving. I came here because you have... you have edges. That I can see.”

I wanted, badly, to tell her that dreams are only the brain cleaning house and spilling a bucket sometimes. I wanted to say that all roads are only roads, that people are only what they are, that the fabric of this place is burlap and ordinary. But my own fingers had started that measuring again—one-two, one-two—on the edge of the table, and I knew better than to call a fear by a smaller name. I made tea. I kept my hands away from her hands until she put hers palm-down on the table like a treaty and I put mine down so that the treaty could be notarized by skin and heat.

“I’m sorry,” she said after a quiet that got heavy. “I’ve made something out of nothing and then I’ve brought it to your door.”

“Nothing can’t be made,” I said. “It’s not a good material.”

She laughed in that hiccup way which was when I loved her best. I was careful with recognizing that word when it rose up inside me, because I felt like a boy who has found a thing in the grass he is not supposed to name. I placed the love in my mouth. I rolled it under my tongue like a stone you keep for luck. I didn’t spit it out. I did not yet say it.

“I will be alright,” she said, as if rehearsing for a time when she would need to say it to someone whose eyes were asking too many questions. “I am only tired. I will get into bed and wake up and the road will be a road again.”

“And if it tries to be anything else,” I said, “you call me, and I will stand in front of it and tell it no.”

“You can stop roads?” she asked, amused gently by me.

“I can stand in a way that makes them reconsider,” I said, and she shook her head.

“Strange,” she murmured. “But good-strange.” She looked at me then with the intentness of a person deciding to trust a map. “You’re not like anyone I’ve known,” she said. “You make things feel lined up.”

“A ledger is a kind of love,” I said, and then regretted saying it aloud. But she didn’t flinch. She nodded, like she understood currency.

When she left, I walked her to the door, to the hall with its scissored light. She pressed my forearm with her fingers, a brief indent I wanted to keep like thumbprints in wet clay. She went down the steps that creaked on two and four. A siren went somewhere that had nothing to do with us, but it still pulled the minutes thin. I went back to my table. I wrote her into a paragraph, then crossed half out. She deserves more than my sentences, I thought, and then found the arrogance in the thought too, the idea I could decide what she deserves. The page sat under my hand like a friendly animal.

All of this, the little economy of us, took place under a season warming into heat. Cicadas stitched their song across the afternoons. The parrots learned new swear-words. The magpies practiced forgiveness for people who had wronged them last spring. Nerida grew a basil plant that failed and then started again two months later because sometimes seeds bide their time. I lost my socks in my own drawer. Mr. Kosta made a fuss over his new cucumbers. Dot told me about her sister’s new knees as if they were a hobby. We spent an hour one weekend trying to fix the sound in Nerida’s speakers, only to discover the channel had changed itself to a frequency where nothing existed. We called it the lost band.

On a day when the sky was hot enough to buzz, I saw Nerida on her front step again, looking down the street in that not-looking way. A car went by too fast and the air fell apart a little in its wake. She flinched, small. I stood with my hands full of nothing and considered all the things I could carry. I wanted to be brave enough to be unbrave with her. The trick of it is that you have to begin and begin and begin. You cannot rehearse.

She turned. “Come with me later?” she asked. “I’ve got that late shift and I hate the carpark at night. Only to the door. You don’t have to wait.”

“I can wait,” I said, and the words lined themselves up like volunteers. “I like being a placeholder.”

“You’re more a person,” she said, absently smiling. “But yes. Thank you.”

We went as the light was going. The hospital rose out of itself like a city inside a city, all its windows domestic glows and cold glints. Nerida drove like a schoolteacher giving a lesson on caution. I watched her hands because they seemed to be telling the wheel a story. The radio was off. We made our own sound with the fan and with small breath. The carpark was flat and paved and filled with those white lines that make adults obedient.

“I’ll be fine,” she said, when she had the car in its place. “My favourite security guard is on.”

“I will be here,” I said, which was maybe not what she had asked for, but it was what I could give, an hour stolen from my night ledger, a body to take up a little bad space so others couldn’t have it.

She touched my shoulder with her two fingers the way she had before and vanished into the hem of the building, a high-visibility vest already in her future. I waited the way men in pictures wait—leaning against a rail like the rail has held up worse. Time moved and yet it didn’t. A moth drummed itself to a frenzy against a light and then accepted a new idea for itself. In the small square of carpark, a gust of wind pushed a circular food container across the concrete like a thing trying to be a small planet. Somewhere, deeper into the concrete, a different siren sounded—not an emergency, not this time, only a systems announcement, a warning that did not belong to us. A voice came over a loudspeaker and said words that could have been foreign even if they weren’t. I put my hands in my pockets and took them out and put them back. The asphalt radiated a day’s stored-up heat and then let it go. When she came back out—quicker than I expected—she startled me into smiling.

“They needed me in early,” she said, and made a face that was about obligation and pride and the heavy pay of both. “You didn’t have to wait. Go home, Ray.”

“I like when you call me that,” I said. “It makes me less cartoon.”

“You’ll always be half-cartoon,” she said, and kissed the air near my cheek, a misfire that still left warmth. Then she went back in, the doors coping open and shut in their hydraulic way, and I walked back to the street, counting steps for no reason, for the reason that counting makes things more real, or less scary, or both.

On the way home I practiced saying her name in different ways. There are names that unlock doors. There are names that build them. I had the sense, then, of something coming to us, not as a threat but as a weather system that doesn’t care whether you have laundry on the line. I adjusted something in myself and then adjusted it back. The hill lifted me up to my door. The jasmine wore its perfume like armour. The kettle took five minutes to boil, a small eternity. I leaned my head against the window’s mesh, the pattern imprinting itself on my skin like a badge for a club whose rules I did not fully know.

A fortnight later—a timeframe that has the dignity of old calendars—she came in the middle of the afternoon, hair wild from a nap, eyes too wide. She stood at my door and didn’t speak, as if words were a trick you use only when needed. I could smell her shampoo and an emergency that had nothing to do with hair.

“You ever think about how thin everything is,” she said finally. “How it can go from being a table to being wood again, or being a car to being metal to being a problem. And people—how people are a walk and a talk and a name and then...”

“I do,” I said. “All the time.”

She nodded as if I had co-signed something terrible. We stood for a long minute, the afternoon pressing against us with the insistence of a small child pulling on a sleeve. The steelworks groaned. The ocean spoke to itself down there as it always does. We looked at each other with our fear showing, but not ashamed of it. If this was the beginning of any end, it did not say. It only lifted the air a little and then set it down wrong, as if someone had been through and moved the furniture an inch while we slept. I set two cups on the counter. I reached for the same jar of tea. My hands were steady, small mercies. I reached for the same comforts, I lined them up. This is how you find the shape of a day again after its outline gets smudged. This is how you love someone who is learning to stand on fear without getting shorter. This is how you live when you have decided to be a gentleman even in a world that forgets the name of it, even in a world that will ask you later, much later, what you thought you were doing when you tried to be careful.The day after she said the word thin and made it into an atmosphere, I lay awake listening to the mesh on my window hum with the wind. It made a music that was not lovely, but it held. The kettle clicked itself empty and I boiled it again because sometimes you put heat into water just to know you can. I thought about the old flyscreen at my mother’s place that had split one summer from a too-eager elbow, and how moths came in like lost stamps, dotting themselves to the ceiling until there were constellations of powder that meant nothing unless you made them mean. My mother didn’t get cross; she said things kept themselves together until they couldn’t and then you found new ways to keep. My father swore at the mosquitoes like they had offended his rank. I lay there and promised the world that I would hold in my edges. It laughed and went on its way.

The next days performed their performances. Mrs. Khan’s bread had a seam that tore obediently under a butter knife. Mr. Kosta gave me cucumbers that were slyly curved, as if they had kept their own counsel before consenting to be eaten. Dot found me in the op shop’s corner with my hand on a silk blouse like I was swearing to it and taught me how to roll instead of fold, her voice patient, her wrists limber as rope. Corey arrived pumping at his pedals like a heart with good intentions and left smears of weather across my doormat. Nerida worked the kind of shifts that move a person’s time zone, her texts arriving when birds were discussing the day or the garbage truck was learning our street anew. Between us we built a language of small messages: a lemon on my step meant she had a morning; jam, tilted, meant she had a stretch of nights; a note that looked like it had been written on her knee meant she was between.

When she drove we sometimes went nowhere in particular, because a destination makes a car arrogant. I sat in the passenger seat and watched the dashboard, those soft-glowing dials that keep a person honest, and I counted in my head to the beat of the indicators because it felt like participating in the safety. We did loops around blocks that had known us for years and I was careful with my words because you can talk a person into a ditch by accident. I learned her tells—the hold of breath at a wet patch, the late blink at a roundabout like it was a question that deserved a thesis. I noticed how she left just enough space between herself and the bumper ahead, as if space were a currency she was saving for later. I tried not to praise her the way you praise a child. Still, I said, “You are precise,” and she said, “That’s another word for scared,” and I said, “Or alive,” and she let the wheel sit straight in her hands and didn’t argue.

We took the car to be vacuumed at a place near the highway where men in shirts the blue of distant mountains sprayed foam until it built its own geography. The vacuum said thrum-thrum-thrum and sucked up beach and hospital dust and tiny stones from every carpark in the region. Under the passenger seat I found a parking stub from two summers ago, bleached almost blank, and a plastic fork that had lost one tine as if it had made a quiet sacrifice. The stuffed magpie that lived on her dashboard—its beak softened from years of being booped by messy fingers—was relocated to the back seat during the wash and peered pickily at us as if we were making poor choices. On the cardboard of the wash bay someone had scrawled in texta SLOW DOWN, in a hand that was urgent and uncapitalized, and I thought of all the unlicensed advice that keeps us upright.

I told her, not that day but a day near to it, that my father had been a panel beater when panel beating still had the romance of turning wrong things right with the persuasion of heat and hammer. He came home with the smell of solvents in his collar and bits of colored paint at his wrist like confetti too stubborn to leave the party. He taught me to see a dent as a kind of history and an invitation. “Metal wants to forget,” he said. “You have to remind it how it was born.” I kept his words in my head the way you keep the answers to exam questions long after the exam has been burned. It occurs to me now that he made a living out of undoing other people’s moments of inattention. It occurs to me that he was not an inattentive man. That photograph of us—the one Nerida found—was taken on a day when he’d just smoothed a crease out of a bonnet and was feeling clean with achievement. My jacket that day was borrowed and my mouth was too serious, but the hand on my shoulder held a kind of pride that was light enough to carry.

In the hospital carpark, the second time I waited, I watched a crow hop from line to line like a chess piece, turning the white paint into a puzzle that only it understood. An announcement crackled in the air—code for a code for a code—and I kept my boots very still as if they were in a photograph. When Nerida’s shift ended the car was not how she had left it. The passenger door was shy by a finger-width; the glovebox hung open in a posture of offense. Papers had been taken out and put back in as if to say, We could have; we didn’t; you don’t know which we would prefer. The stuffed magpie was not where it lived. Nerida stood very straight and her breathing became arithmetic. The security guard with the soft moustache came over with his pen out like a wand. We filled out a form that had boxes for harm. We stated that there was none we could see. We both knew that wasn’t entirely true.

I walked the perimeter because a circle is sometimes more powerful than a straight line. Near the hedge that pretended to be domestic, I found the magpie wedged like contraband, its cloth wing caught on a twig. I freed it gently and two ants came with it, disappointed. When I brought it back, Nerida put her hand to her mouth and made a sound that could have been a laugh if the world had been more generous. She took the bird from me the way a person takes a baby for someone else, practiced, reverent, meaning not to keep it, meaning instead to keep it safe. We did not catch the thief. The thief took nothing that cost money. The thief rearranged. Sometimes that’s worse.

Dot told me the story of the year they changed the stop signs at the corner near the church and how, for three Sundays in a row, someone went through out of habit because their body didn’t have room for the new rule. “We’re not built for instant,” she said, her hands full of a sequined dress that didn’t know about daytime. “We lag. We’re tide.” She had had a sister once who was hit by a bakery van in 1974, cake trays flying like comedic birds. The sister had lived, cake had not, and Dot said she avoided that corner for five years then walked it twice a day until it felt like a hallway again. “If your friend doesn’t like driving, don’t let her make it a god,” she said, and I wondered how Dot managed to place such large ideas between price tags and donated lamps without making them cheap. I bought a vase shaped like a hand and put rosemary in it because sometimes a gesture needs to be literal to behave.

At the beach one Monday after she had slept not at all, Nerida stood in water we could have described politely as brisk and swore under her breath in a way that would not have offended a priest. The ocean lifted its dress and showed us its underskirt of weed. A child near us discovered that sand can be sculpted into a tank, and his father pretended to be bombed in a way that was more tender than violent. “Do you drive?” she asked again, and I said, “I did,” and she said, “Past tense is loud,” and I thought, Yes, it is. The last time I drove with intention I drove into a story I have no wish to rehearse. It was years ago and dark and a dog came out of a paddock with a look like joy and I could not, I could not, and then I was on the shoulder with my head against the wheel and the sound my mouth made was one I didn’t recognize. The dog did not live in pain long because a farmer with a practical hand and a spanner had a kind of grace that does not make it into books. I put the car in drive a week later and took it back to a man who said he could sell it and I begin again on foot. I did not tell her this in those words. I told her my feet had grown clever and what was the point of being clever if you didn’t use it.

Finn landed his kickflip on a Wednesday with no one watching properly and then hollered until we understood we had missed a great event. We clapped like grandparents and he did it again and this time failed in a way that was warm and human. He fell on his backside and laughed, and I thought: sometimes the body knows before the brain that it is not broken, and we should learn from that. We bought him a lemonade from the milk bar and he said “legend” in a way that included us in a pantheon we had not expected to join. On the way home a flock of corellas took off from a jacaranda and turned the air into a paper storm. Nerida said, “They’re so much when they want to be,” and I said, “They practice,” and she nodded like practice was a religion she had once belonged to and was thinking of rejoining.

The stranger from the servo appeared again, or someone like him, on the path at Puckeys where the creek considers the ocean and then consents to it. He was turned out in shorts and a shirt that did not agree with each other and his face had collapsed into itself the way a tent does when you pull up the wrong peg. Nerida’s body leaned to him and then leaned back, because it is hard to invite need to your doorstep when you haven’t had lunch. We asked if he was okay and he said words like “right” and “fine” that had no meat on them. He looked at the water as if it was an answer on a test that had been given to someone else. I thought about all the maps that leave out the part where you’re standing. We watched him walk away, each of us thinking we should follow and neither of us moving because the day was already full of big. Later, at the corner shop, we bought two sandwiches and left them on the railing of a bench without inventing a person who would find them. Gifts don’t require prophecy.

At night my pencils were lined up obedient as soldiers, my paper white like trust. I wrote the town as if it had learned a new song. I wrote a man who kept other people’s objects safe and tried not to write myself as a saint. I wrote a woman who wore a yellow slicker like a joke that never stopped being funny and whose car kept making sounds like a bag of cutlery. Sometimes I got the sentence I wanted and I felt the click of it in my bones. Sometimes I wandered around the desk the way a hungry person walks around the kitchen, counting instead of eating. I wrote the word love and then erased it, left the mark on the page as if it had been branded by sunlight. I told myself that a ledger is only a story that doesn’t apologize for counting.

On Crown Street one afternoon a delivery van ran the amber that had already become red and I put my hand to Nerida’s elbow and pulled. It was the kind of pull that embarrasses everyone if it’s not needed and saves you if it is. The van parted the air in a way that made everyone else around us taller for a second and then shorter. Nerida’s face did a small, private thing, and then she laughed at me because we were both still upright. “You’re very quick for a man who professes to be deliberate,” she said, and I said, “My mother taught me to catch falling cups,” and she said, “Is that a metaphor?” and I said, “It started as one,” and then we went into the store that had lights that hummed and bought dish soap because we both suddenly needed things to shine.

The post brought her a camera fine with numbers printed like doom and a picture of her car captured mid-blink. She sat on my steps holding it like a photograph of someone she didn’t recall becoming. “It was the change on Princes,” she said into her knee. “They moved the sign and I was a person who went where she shouldn’t an exact number of kilometres per hour.” We looked at the cost together and it had a kind of heft that made my stomach professional. “I can help,” I said, in the tone of a man who thinks money is a rug he can lay over a hole. She shook her head and smiled in the way that says tenderness to the offer, no to the offerer. “I’ll manage,” she said. “I hate that I can say that and still feel my heart on the floor.” We worked it out on a spare envelope with a biro that had not signed anything important before. It is a blessing to watch someone do arithmetic on a knee and know you will not be asked to be the solution.

The hospital ran a safety seminar in the old lecture theatre with the fold-up seats that punish the unready. Nerida said it was mandatory and asked if I would come so that afterward she could laugh properly. We watched a police officer who had learned his statistics the way some people learn psalms. He spoke of stopping distances and the alcohol content of regret and showed pictures that made the room’s air thick, like syrup that had stopped saying it was sweet. A woman at the back cried in such a contained way it was like she was watering a plant only she could see. Nerida slid her hand under the fabric between our seats and let her little finger tap the side of my thumb in a rhythm only we would have recognized. The officer said we had to slow down and we all nodded because we are very good at consenting to ideas inside rooms. After, in the corridor with its stale dreams of learning, Nerida leaned on a wall and said, “It feels rigged, the world,” and I said, “It is; and also, sometimes it forgets to uphold its own rules,” and we both looked at the exit sign like it was a miracle we were allowed to touch.

At home, the basil she had declared a loss put out a leaf that was frankly cheeky. We stood over it like new parents and said things like “Would you look at that” in voices that had been saved for much larger victories. I made us toasted sandwiches with cheese that pretended to be generous and ham that pretended to be healthy. She put on a record that had collected dust because it knew the future would need its crackle. We ate with our mouths full and told stories of how we had each been humiliated by sports. She had once failed to catch a netball with such certainty that the girl behind her laughed until she got the hiccups. I had once jumped in a pool confident as a horse and come up with my shorts making a plan to escape. We laughed until my neighbour upstairs, the one with the slow broom, banged his ceiling lightly with a handle to let us know we were still part of a city.

Later, when the hour changed shape and the kettle had performed once more, Nerida stood at my sink and washed two cups with a focus that would have saved nations if applied correctly. She handed me the first one and I dried in circles like the manual would approve. “I keep thinking about brakes,” she said, as if the thought had been impatient on her tongue. “I keep thinking they are the only proof we have that we meant to be careful.” I rested the cloth on my shoulder and considered the cup in my hand which was not a metaphor and then was. “They’re also proof you had momentum,” I said. “Only moving things need them.” She smiled at the window because sometimes you can’t look at the person who has said the thing. We stood there with the streetlight coming through the mesh and making ladder-shadows up our arms, and I knew I had chosen well when I had decided, years ago, to align myself with care even when it made me ridiculous. She gave the second cup to me and our fingers touched in a way that was both incidental and not, and for a moment the thinness of things thickened to something you could stand on.

In the morning she went to pay the fine and came back with a receipt and a loaf from Mrs. Khan’s that had the steam of choosing right. We ate heel slices with butter that was almost soft and shared a small, giddy pride at having wrestled with a system and not lost. Outside, the lorikeets discussed our decisions at a volume that suggested they had never had to apologize to anyone. I thought then that the chapter we were in—our own unspecific chapter, not one you could put in a book—was the sort that begins without announcement. You look up one day and you have been in it for months. You have learned the twist in the stairs and the creak in the second floorboard and you can make tea in the dark. You start thinking of which wall would take a print. You consider your life not as a diagram but as a room you can furnish.

A week later, at dusk, the steelworks let out a sound I had not heard before, a long sigh that had a complaint in it. People on our street turned their heads in the same way birds will when a new shape aerates the sky. Nerida came out with damp hair and a jumper that had knitted itself into a soft authority and stood beside me on the step as if we were meeting a weather change. The air was the sort that puts your skin on alert without telling you why. Somewhere, up the hill, there was the slap of someone’s screen door and a spirit-level of wind that told the jasmine it was time to brag. “I had another of those dreams,” she said, like she was placing something down on a bench and letting me read the label. “I remembered the bit I lost. The word the wind took. It was ‘stay’.” We did not move, out of respect for the drama of that small syllable. Then we went inside and made tea because I have learned that the kettle does not ask for proof that you deserve the comfort. It just boils. It is agreeable. It is one of the few machines that always stops when you ask it to.In the morning after the dream admitted its missing word, the street wore a clean expression like a face newly shaved. Nerida came over with wet hair braided in a way that suggested she had attempted and then forgiven herself for imperfection. She stood with her hand on my lintel as if testing the house’s pulse, then let herself in like we had agreed without saying so. “Stay,” she said again, not as a question or a command, but as if she were checking its weight in different light. The word fell between us and did not shatter. We sat with it in the kitchen, with the kettle admitting it was mortal, with the mesh throwing its checked shadow on the table, with the lemon on the bench in a pose so confident it might have been a paperweight for sunlight. She told me she kept waking on the half-hour as if her body were a bureaucrat, stamping times. I told her about counting to sixteen and then back down as if I were persuading a small orchestra to play. We ate toast in corners so the butter could drip without causing scandal. When she left she forgot her sunglasses and I put them on top of the fridge because I have learned that important objects climb to higher ground when their owners are not present.

We began to practice staying in ways that were practical. She left a cardigan on the back of one of my chairs and neither of us fetched it back because we liked the sight of it, this small blue claim. I put a spare toothbrush in a mug by my sink and pretended it had always been there, one of a pair like shoes that avoid living alone. She brought over a set of keys on a lanyard from the hospital that had seen better loops. She took the key to my front door with the seriousness of a person touching something ceremonial. “I’ll water your basil if you forget,” she said, and I said, “It has recently learned resurrection,” and she smiled like we were both in faiths that made room for miracles if they were small and leaf-shaped. I kept her key in the bowl by the door where I keep the things that help me leave, and I thought about the inverse: the things that help me stay.

There was a day that tasted like coins when the wind went straight through our clothes and said it was doing us a favor by reminding us of our shape. We went to the pool at Austinmer because Nerida said she needed lanes, needed the comfort of a line that shows you what forward means. The sea pool made its own weather. It contained a version of the ocean that had agreed to rules. Children in bright caps took the water like it was a dare they would win, whether or not the water agreed. We sat on the concrete lip and watched a woman swim lengths with a form so clean it felt like an apology to all the times the body gets it wrong. Nerida said she had been a reasonable swimmer once, and I could hear the ghost-splash of the school carnival through her voice. She walked the width of the shallow end with her arms held out like a tightrope walker for the ground. “When I drive,” she said, chin angled up so as not to let the water touch her mouth, “I feel like I am being asked to prove I deserve to continue. In the pool I feel like I am on probation, but at least the borders are honest.” A boy cannonballed near us with an exuberance that suggested laws were for other people, and we smiled because people like us prefer our laws to have soft edges. When she got out her skin had that baptized sheen and she shivered like she was living in high resolution. “Better,” she admitted, and I handed her a towel that had known many summers and we sat side by side warming up as if we were the kind of friends who had always known the shape of the other’s quiet.

When the hospital roster forgave her for a week and placed her in days, we tried driving in the empty auxiliary carpark after hours. The asphalt there was sunburnt and forgiving, and the gum leaves skittered and made a noise like small applause when the breeze convened. She practiced reversing into a space with the patience of a surgeon threading a needle while the clock was watching. I talked less than I wanted to, because encouragement can make a person feel as if they will disappoint you at every turn. She breathed in counts you could have scored music to. She kept her elbows soft, her jaw steadier than mine. When the car sat straight between two white lines she looked at me as if I had given her a lighthouse, which of course I hadn’t; she had given herself one and I had merely kept the weather out while she did it. “Again,” she said, a different kind of hunger in the word, and we did, and then again, and when the light went down to that particular amber that makes everything look like it has a story, we went home, triumphant in the way you are when the world has agreed, briefly, to be safe and your body has remembered its instructions.

Dot held an afternoon tea for reasons unnamed, which is to say she had made scones and needed a plausible audience. She laid them out on a table covered with a cloth that had four small burns from a previous life and a new spray of blue pansies like forgiveness. The scones were the sort that pull apart obediently and hold jam like a cause. Mr. Kosta told a joke about a fisherman and a tax inspector that I had heard before and laughed at in a fresh way because repetition is sometimes its own generosity. Corey blew in and out like a weather front and left his bike leaning against Dot’s fence with a confidence that said he expected the world not to take his only vehicle. Finn arrived with skinned knees and the bragging rights of a boy who had landed a trick and supplied a witness to the landing. Nerida came late from a shift she called sticky, which I understood as a collection of hours that had adhered to her in the wrong places. She took one bite of a scone and said “Oh,” as if pleased to be reminded that sweetness is sanctioned somewhere. Dot asked me if we had thought about the charity ball at the council hall on Saturday, the one that would be more raffle than ball. Nerida lifted her eyebrows as if asking me to be the sort of person who goes to a raffle and I nodded because I like occasions that require a paper ticket and a hand-drawn sign warning you about the step.

At the charity ball the lights made everything plausible. They were those ropey strings you see at weddings and car dealerships, democratic and enthusiastic, generous to all faces. The hall smelled like polish and school plays. A trio in the corner performed with the humility of the number three. There were cakes you could win by estimating their weight with your eyes and jars with numbers drawn on sticky dots. Nerida wore a dress the blue of a sky that gets away with being dramatic and sneakers with paint on them because you can choose your formality and still run if needed. I wore the jacket that behaves like a good dog. We danced not because the music demanded it but because standing still seemed rude. It turns out that careful people can surprise themselves with how much they are willing to jolt when the safe floor is good and the room has agreed to hold them. We were terrible and it did not matter; we were geraniums in a room of roses and the bees came anyway. Mrs. Khan’s husband won a succulent that looked like it had daydreams, and Dot won a voucher for a haircut and gave it to Corey who pretended not to know what to do with it and said thank you into the space above Dot’s left shoulder. On the walk home the stars acted like they had never been questioned, and Nerida held the hem of her dress up in one hand as if she were crossing a stream, and I put my hand on the small of her back once at a curb without thinking and then thought about it all night as if it were a crime and a prayer.

On a Tuesday that began well and then forgot its promise, we were crossing in front of the pharmacy when a sedan took the corner too immediately and turned its bumper into grammar. Nerida did the thing she does when fear enters as an uninvited cousin: she went quiet, which is to say she became the opposite of brittle, and still you could hear the shudder inside the wordless. I put my arm out in that old ritual that pretends a human forearm can halt a car. The driver, a man with an expression like ledger paper that had seen rain, lifted his hand in apology and then lifted it again, more theatrically, as if he were making a sign for absolution to anyone who might be watching. A woman on the corner said “Careful, mate” without rancour. Nerida and I stood with breath in our throats while the sedan recomposed itself and went away like a moral lesson with poor timing. Later she said she didn’t know whether she was more angry at him for driving wrong or at her body for keeping a record. That night I set the kettle at a higher pitch and we ate noodles directly from bowls and watched a movie from the eighties wherein cars never seemed to stop for anyone and people fell in love exclusively in montage. Nerida laughed at a laser effect that looked like a kitchen appliance and then cried at a moment where a character said “stay” to a person who couldn’t. She cried the way some people sneeze, susceptible but unembarrassed. I learned where in my house the tissues live when they are needed urgently and I learned that even in grief’s small cousin you can be useful.

The stranger from the servo found a temporary orbit. He began to appear at the bench by the bus stop where the jacaranda had not yet decided to perform. He wore a hat that had been a generosity from a company at least three hand-me-downs ago and shoes that were having an argument with their own tongues. He sat and watched the buses without boarding, as if he was auditing their commitment to consistency. When we passed we greeted him with the neighborly tone you reserve for those who live in your weather but not your house. One day his hands shook in such a measured way I suspected his body of telling an old story to itself. Nerida asked if he wanted a sandwich with the kind of gentle that doesn’t require the receiver to accept or return, and he looked at her like she had placed a lamp in a dark tent. “I don’t like ham,” he said after a deep consideration, and she said, “No ham then,” and brought him one with cheese and pickles that glowed like currency in their small windows. He ate slowly and spoke to the birds as if negotiating jurisdiction. When we left he said “Thanks, Nurse,” and I watched Nerida take that word like a badge she couldn’t decide whether to pin inside or out. Later, she told me she was tired of being a professional receptacle for apologies and still couldn’t stop asking people if they were okay. I told her that the shape of a life is often determined by the questions we ask whether or not we are paid for the answers.

At night, with the brass of the day dulled and our hearts returned to their practice tempos, I wrote. The lamplight made an island out of my desk and I inhabited it as if my passport had been stamped. I wrote a chapter in which the gentleman finds himself at the edge of a road he doesn’t trust and the woman with the water-name decides to drive anyway because nowhere is not a destination. I wrote them into a kind of safety and then took it away and then found a way to give it back that felt earned. I crossed out adjectives with a violence I did not otherwise permit myself, and I kept the verbs that had bones. More and more I found I was writing not the town as it appears in the postcard rack but the town as it felt in the cheek and under the fingernail. The steelworks was an organ that played itself. The ocean was a complicated friend. The escarpment watched without comment because it had seen versions of us before. I wrote the mesh on the window into a pattern that looked like music. When the kettle clicked, I let it lean into its silence before I asked it for another round because love needs pauses to make sense of itself.

The fine that had bruised the corner of Nerida’s budget became a story we told around other people’s tables in a way that did not invite them to solve it. “It’s not the money,” she would say, and then laugh because of course it was the money, and also something else that money masks, and we would both look at the ceiling briefly as if an answer lived in the plaster. Mr. Kosta, who considers advice a crop that requires regular harvesting, suggested she take the old Thirroul road because it was less of a blank face, more of a conversation. “It talks to you,” he said, hands moving like a pair of birds under control. “You cannot sleep while you go in the curves.” He told us about the time his cousin had tried to teach a frightened dog to like the ute by feeding it kangaroo jerky in the passenger seat until the animal associated the vehicle with joy and salt. I pictured Nerida in the car with jerky and rejected the metaphor on her behalf and she grinned because she had pictured it too and because she could see me feeling protective of her dignity and not entirely hating it.

We tried the Thirroul road on a Sunday morning early before the world had remembered its errands. The light fell through the gums like it had made an appointment. The curves demanded attention and, in this, they offered a mercy. We kept the radio lane quiet except for a song that came on uninvited and spoke about staying from a decade when hair was a kind of politics. Near the turn-out that lets you pretend the horizon belongs to you, we pulled over. We stood with the doors open because it felt like a way of telling the day we were accessible but not unguarded. A handful of motorbikes went by and gave us that enormous sound that men in leather prefer to policy. Nerida leaned on the bonnet lightly as if complimenting it on a performance. She looked down at her hands and said they did not feel like hers when she was going downhill. I told her my hands sometimes became a set of borrowed gloves when I had not slept, and she said maybe that was all fear was: a temporary glove. On the way back we stopped for a pie we had not earned by any measure except hunger and ate it on the step of a shop that sold things no one needed urgently. A dog that may or may not have belonged to the postman sat on the road’s crown and practiced a philosophy of sunlight. We thought about making a plan for the afternoon and then didn’t, which is a kind of luxury that deserves mention when it appears.

It rained with purpose two nights in a row, the kind of rain that upgrades everything it touches. The rosemary stood taller. The street learned a new smell. The lorikeets took offense and then took their offense elsewhere. In the wet, cars wear their intentions more plainly. They make their risks visible. From my window I watched the headlights move across the ceiling like a slow planetarium and I counted them without telling myself why. Nerida and I stayed in my kitchen with the larger light off because we did not need to be declared to the night, and we spoke in the voices that people use when they trust there will be no interruptions. She told me about the first patient she lost on her own shift, years back, a woman whose hair had held on to its vanity with admirable stubbornness and whose sons had argued in the corridor about whether to keep the television on so Match of the Day could keep its appointment. Nerida said death is sometimes tidy and sometimes not, and the tidy ones get mistaken for kindness. I told her my mother’s friend, the one who lived above the deli, had insisted on lighting a candle when her husband went, even though the building’s rules said electricity only. “It wasn’t about God,” I said. “It was because a flame looks like a yes.” We listened to the rain say yes to the gutter until it ran out of sentence. Before she went home she put her hand on the back of my neck and left it there for the length of a long blink and I let it be a benediction even though I don’t think we were blessing anything but the animal comfort of skin.

The next morning the street had the after-image of rain, pocks in the gravel and a forgiving light. A council truck came and bothered a pothole until it felt itself again. The stranger from the bench was not there. In his place was a wet newspaper whose headline shouted something about a vote on the hill, and a sachet of sugar that had given up its contents to weather. Finn attempted a new trick that involved both physics and prayer and was undone by the latter’s inconsistency. Dot waved me in to help her move a couch that had outlived its spring, and I earned a biscuit and a lecture about backs. Mrs. Khan told me in a confidential tone that her cousin’s cousin had come over from Perth and was in love with the ocean as if it had recently been invented. “He walks like a man leaving a village,” she said, and I held that picture for the rest of the day because sometimes metaphors show up at the bakery and you must take them home at once.

That afternoon there was a rattle at my door and it was Nerida with her face set in that controlled neutral that nurses develop the way some people develop calluses. She said her shift had been fine and then said, more precisely, that no one had died and the machines had complied and the parents had not shouted and the coffee had been ruthless and she would be grateful later if not now. We lay on my rug, not in a romantic way, but in the way people lie down when they want the world to stop tilting and take instruction from a flat surface. The rug shared with us its old life—ground-in sand, a drop of wax from a candle we had not lit together, the ghost of someone else’s dog. We looked at the ceiling like it was a museum. She told me she had driven home by a longer route because the short one had had a police car on it and her bones had not consented to that image staring into her rear-view. “I am ridiculous,” she said, with an eagerness to preempt any judgement anyone else might have. “I am incrementally less afraid and intermittently more afraid and I am exhausting myself with the math.” I said that a ledger can show profit on one page and loss on the next and still be a good year. She said I should write a book doing the accounts for feelings and I said I was trying. She turned on her side and pressed two fingers to the top of my sternum as if finding a pulse on a building, and I breathed and counted and decided that staying can sometimes be demonstrated by the act of remaining horizontal while a person relearns upright.

When she left she did not take the cardigan. She did not take the spare toothbrush or the jar of jam we had already almost finished. She did take the stuffed magpie because, apparently, it had an appointment at the hospital set of a child’s room where it would perch on a monitor and try to make fear ridiculous. That evening, in the hour that is less a time than a hinge, I heard brakes in the street—reasonable, not desperate—and then voices, and then the patient sound of someone explaining to someone else how they would tell this story later in a way that did not make them feel small. I looked out and saw a car stopped at an angle that suggested it had changed its mind about its destination. Behind it, a cyclist stood with the defensive posture of a person who knows he had the right of way and also the luck. Two other cars had parked themselves in solidarity against chaos. The driver spoke with her hands in a way that read as apology from a distance. The cyclist stood still as if to show her how that looked. A woman walking a dog that had opinions negotiated an arc around them as if drawing a diagram. The situation became its own teacher and then, after a few more words and a couple of shoulder-shrugs and a careful tug on a handlebar to prove alignment, it released itself. The car corrected its angle like a singer finding her note. The cyclist rode away with his head a little high. The dog accepted that it would never be told the full story. I made tea again because this is what I do when the world asks for an audience but not an actor, and I wrote a sentence that felt like it might hold for a while and then left it alone so as not to scare it into running.

There was a day of wind that made the jacarandas invent a later season. The blossoms lay on the pavement like a map of a country that believed in small borders. Nerida came over in the middle of this purple weather and said she wanted to practice roundabouts, which would have been funny if it wasn’t so fierce. We went out early enough to meet only people with lists. She drove with ambition and caution, a difficult duet, and when the indicator ticked off its metronome against her palm she exhaled like she had received an answer key. “People get in the circle and forget,” she said, eyes wide, not with panic now but with observation. “They become ungoverned, temporarily.” We did three roundabouts in a row and then went home and ate oranges like we had returned from a pilgrimage. She peeled hers in a long spiral and held it up as if showing proof of something, and I put the peel on the edge of the sink and our kitchen smelled like a small promise for the rest of the day.

It is one of the oddities of loving someone that their objects become significant beyond their practical use. Nerida’s car, with its new carefulness and its old noises, became to me a sort of mechanical cousin. I announced to it, under my breath, when we were going to the supermarket, as if it had preferences. I tapped the dashboard twice before we reversed because it felt wrong not to. I learned the pitch at which the fan announces dust. I was not sentimental about vehicles before; I had left a car in a man’s yard once and had not even turned to watch him call another man to collect it and shape it into another person’s drive. Now I found myself willing this old Corolla to last through a change of jobs, a leap of confidence, a winter that would not forgive thin tires. I reminded myself that machines do not listen to prayers except in movies, and I said one anyway.

We saw the stranger at the bus stop again, but not alone. A woman with an official lanyard and a bag that was trying to be both friendly and professional sat on the bench with him. She used his name, which we could not hear but could see in the way she angled her body. He looked at his shoes and then at the sky and then somewhere in between, as if triangulating a safe answer. We walked past without making our usual offer because the moment belonged to people paid for their patience. Later, Nerida said, “He will have to tell his story again,” and I pictured the boxes like our fines, like our forms in the carpark, except now the boxes would be for nights slept in bed or not bed, for days eaten or not, for substances declared or shrugged, for the time he last felt like a person with his hands on the controls. I wanted to fill out a form for him that said, It is not his fault that the shapes have wronged him, and put a tick in a box that released all tedious consequences, and I knew the world doesn’t run on my imagination no matter how tidy my columns.

I do not know what to do with the fact that the world continued to be good to us in small ways while delivering its usual slaps elsewhere. It made me want to bow to it incorrectly. Nerida and I went to the market and bought a cauliflower with a confidence I had not previously seen in a vegetable. We found a man selling records that smelled like dust and promise and bought one that had a song on it from the year my mother had pushed me out into the world and said “Right then.” We saw Corey toss a paper bag into the air and catch it with the satisfaction of a man who had avoided one indignity among many. We watched Finn climb a fence and then climb back down because a woman laughed and told him he was destined for council. We ate fish and chips on a bench near the lighthouse and had to be brave about the gulls. The chips burned our tongues and reminded us that we were alive now, not in some later where fear had been conquered and trophies had been assigned. We talked about the practicalities of a weekend away, that fantasy you build like Lego before you look at the calendar and the fuel prices and the idea of sleeping in a strange bed. We did not decide. I put the word “Kiama” in my pocket because it felt like a marble I could roll around when I needed the idea of a sound that is all arrival and spray.

Late that night, when the world had gone into its backstage routine and the steelworks had modulated into the key of distant, I woke to Nerida’s name on my phone. She wrote only one sentence, and it had the doorframe of a joke and the carpet of a plea. “I can’t make the brakes in my head work.” I did not write back in sentences because a phone is a poor collaborator for the orchestra of reassurance. I wrote, “I’m coming,” and I put on my jacket because even in the middle of the night the habit of care wants its uniform. The air in the hall tasted like other people’s dinners and something oddly floral from a bottle that should have been closed. Her door opened to my knock and she stood there with that too-wide look, the one she wears only when trust has been asked to work a double. We did not speak loudly because fear is susceptible to echoes. We sat on her couch which was bravely new and therefore did not know about the comfort it owed us yet. I took her foot in my hand—not the way you hold lovers, not yet, but the way you hold a bird you have rescued from a window—and I placed it on the floor and we pressed down together and then lifted and then pressed down again, left then right, left then right, slow, as if teaching a body basic physics. It was ridiculous and very serious, and I thought about all the rituals humans have invented to trick the dark into standing still. We did it until she laughed at me, not because the fear had been mocked into leaving, but because my earnestness is sometimes its own stand-up show, and we got to the next minute and then the next and then the next, with brakes that were not perfect but were visible.

When the morning came, it arrived noisy and confident as mornings are in our town, and the thinness of things thickened. Nerida slept for two hours on my couch with one hand open on her chest like a shell that had realized water was not imminent. I sat at the table and wrote long, unpunctuated sentences in my notebook that I would later cut into sense, because sometimes you must make a mess at the right time. When she woke she asked for coffee as if it had done something for her recently, and we drank it bitter and strong and stood in our own kitchen doors like diplomatic envoys who had remembered which country they represented. She went home to shower and came back with two shirts on hangers because she said I should choose and I chose wrong first and right second, and she kissed my cheek so lightly my skin thought it might have been weather and then she went to the hospital and I went to split a lemon and count my spoons.

It is a strange thing to be happy, cautiously, in a town that hums with machinery and grief and corellas and raffle tickets and thin places. It makes you walk with your hands out a little, as if feeling for invisible furniture. It makes you inventory your blessings like someone might be checking the receipts. I am not religious in the way that requires kneeling, but I find myself giving thanks in my ledger for a basil plant’s stubbornness, for the way Nerida’s name sits in my mouth, for brakes that work most of the time in actual cars and sometimes in heads, for green lights that forgive hesitations, for magpies that decide you are no longer a problem, for the way a kettle stops when asked. I am not a saint. I am a man with a pen and a jacket and a window that insists on making music. I am a man being taught, daily, to stay.Spring turned up with its collar straightened and its head freshly washed, and the mornings arrived salt-sticky as ever, but brighter at the edges, like someone had traced around the day with a soft pencil. The jasmine staged its last brag and the bottlebrush lit itself like a row of matches, and the steelworks’ long low moan shifted key until, on some afternoons, it sounded almost contemplative. Nerida wore lighter jumpers and her hair learned a new kind of weather. She stood on her step with a mug and tested the air like a baker prodding dough, and I stood on mine and thought, as I often did, about the ways we say yes to the day. We had begun to get good at staying, not as a dramatic declaration but as a practice that lived itself out in keys on a ring, in a cardigan not claimed, in the way the kettle remembered our hands.

A flyer arrived in our letterboxes printed in a blue too bold for information and announced, in a font that had known committee discussions, that the steelworks was hosting an open day. Dot brought hers over and said we should go because free events are civic duty and because she wanted to see if the blast furnace looked like it did in the documentary from 1987 that she still owned on VHS. Mr. Kosta came to the fence and said the same thing with more authority and a story about a cousin who once took a job there and learned to tell steel by smell and by sound, which made him a legend in the family and hard to live with at breakfast. I had never been beyond the perimeter. For years the place had been a sleeping animal to me, growling through dreams and moving its weight around at night. My father had worked in a smaller way with metal, in a shed where the radio was always on and the air had tang you could taste, but this was the cathedral of it, and I wanted, without quite knowing why, to be admitted.

We queued with children in hats shaped like yellow helmets and men in hats shaped like pride and women who had dressed for a wedding because they understood that ceremony lives in the eye. We put on paper visitor badges and actual helmets and glasses that made everyone look like they were pretending to be careful and the pretending had become habit. A guide with a voice that could have narrated a prize cow led us through corridors that smelled like heat stored and released. We saw slabs roll and coils wind like sleeping snakes that had consented to being useful, and I felt my father’s hand on my shoulder bodiless and particular, the way a scent can be a touch if you have earned it. Nerida put her headphones of compliance over her ears and leaned toward the railings as if seeking the heartbeat of something previously considered inanimate. The guide talked about e‑stops and interlocks and the choreography of safety, and I thought of our brakes, literal and otherwise, and felt grateful for every human who had placed their inventiveness at the service of stopping.

Afterward our cheeks held heat as if we had sat too close to a story, and we walked back into the ordinary air with ears that hadn’t yet adjusted to birdsong. On the hill a kookaburra rehearsed a laugh that didn’t fully commit, and down in the carpark a boy balanced on a low chain and fell off with delight. Nerida took off her glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose with a finger like a blessing. “Machines that stop when asked,” she said, not quite to me. “Imagine.” I thought about kettles clicking, and about the way she had stood at my table pressing her feet to the floor in the night so the brakes in her head would recall their training, and I thought about how the world is a system of levers and lines and how often the line we need isn’t painted on the road at all. We walked home beside people carrying balloons printed with logos and tote bags filled with pamphlets and a new appreciation for the precise language of danger, and when we reached our street the jasmine made a case for nature and Dot offered us cordial as if we had returned from war.

The Corolla collected a notice that wore the tone of a school principal reminding you of a rule you already knew. Registration. A date with a number that didn’t care about our debts or our timing announced itself on a white slip of paper with a stamp indignantly red. We took the car to a mechanic recommended by Kosta, a man named Tasos who stood in a grease-sheened cave and spoke to engines in a dialect you couldn’t learn without marrying into it. He listened to the Corolla with a stethoscope that made him look like a doctor for useful things and then scraped a knuckle against his jaw and said the brakes could do with gratitude. He didn’t say, Your brakes are a letter of apology that needs more words, but I heard it all the same. He quoted a number that made Nerida’s shoulders perform their familiar arithmetic, and I said we could split it and she shook her head and smiled in the way that tries not to embarrass the offerer. In the end, because the human economy is untidy, I brought Tasos a lemon slice wrapped in wax paper from Mrs. Khan and he took exactly the parts of fairness he could accept. “She is a good car,” he said after, hands cradling the air like there was a bonnet in it. “If you are kind to her she will forgive you.” We nodded like people receiving marital advice and went home with a receipt that looked like a truce.

On the Sunday when the air loosened around our ankles and the gulls had declared the esplanade open for business, we took the train to Kiama because tracks, unlike roads, invite surrender. We sat on the ocean side because you must when it’s offered and watched the headlands approach like elders who have decided to be generous. Nerida pressed her forehead to the glass and made faces at children who responded with the solemnity of diplomats. At Minnamurra an old man pressed the door button with anger as if technology could be punished out of its delays. In Kiama the blowhole wore a crowd like a hat and presented itself when it chose and not when everyone stared, which is a good rule for any performer. When the ocean breathed through rock and hurled itself upward and became a yes you could feel on your face, Nerida laughed as if the joke had been written for her. “Stay,” she said, and it sounded like both a command to the surge and an invitation to the afternoon. We ate chips from a parcel that leaked its history onto our fingers and watched a dog try to work out whether water that moves like that can be herded, and we decided the answer was noble intentions only. We took the long way back past gardens that had opinions about roses, and in the window of an antique shop a mirror caught us and turned us into a pair that might have been together for years, which is a kind of hope and a kind of joke and neither of us corrected it.

I showed her my writing in a way that felt like opening the door to a room I hadn’t dusted. It was the pages about a man named for his bones who believed that attention could be both salvation and a bruise, and a woman whose name meant sea and therefore promise and therefore danger, because words do not arrive empty. She read at my table with her head tilted like a nurse checking a drip, and I forced myself to make tea as if it were not an exam. When she finished she placed her palms on the paper and let them sit there like she was stopping it from going anywhere foolish. “You have been careful with me,” she said, and then, because she is precise, “and with yourself. But you don’t have to make care mean you can never use a knife.” I looked down at my words and saw where I had rounded corners that could have borne being sharp and saw where tenderness had avoided harm and also avoided truth, which sometimes share a house. “If I find a dent,” she said, smiling like a challenge disguised as relief, “I’ll tell you. You can’t promise to leave no mark. It’s not honest.” I thought about the vow I’d made to make no dent where I stood and recognized that even a thank-you note leaves an imprint, paper thinner where the letters lean. I understood I had been living like a boy who believed the floor would tell on him if he walked too loud. We put the pages aside, shared the last of the jam with a spoon, and made a pact that stories could bruise if they then knew how to bless.

The stranger from the servo thinned, then thickened, then thinned again, as if he were an argument the town kept having in a voice it didn’t want to admit was its own. He vanished from the bus stop for days, and that was its own weather. Then one afternoon we saw him again, not alone this time, but bracketed by a man with a DJAG lanyard and a woman with a folder that had been reinforced at the corners by someone who understands things fall apart there first. He had new shoes on that had not yet learned his feet and he looked at them as if they might teach him how the ground works. He didn’t see us, or he did and saved his greeting for a later in which he would be less seen. Nerida stood with her hands in her pockets and leaned back on the fence like approval pretending to be casual. “I don’t know if he will get a better story,” she said, not in despair but the way you talk to weather that can’t hear you. “I want to write him one,” I said, and she smiled because she knows I try to make things behave when language is in the room, and because she also knows that even a sentence can only do what it can and then stop.

There was a storm that began like gossip and matured into a thesis. The clouds arranged themselves as if convened by committee and the wind lifted the hairs on our arms in that older-than-language way that says change. The first crack tore across the sky like a zipper, and then light came down somewhere we couldn’t see and made everyone on our street look up with the exact same expression as if a teacher had called our names. The power left in a dignified hurry and the room became the kind of dark that respects furniture. We lit candles because Dot has taught the entire block that electricity is only one form of consent, and the flame did that wobble which makes you protective of it, that small yes to a theory. In the quiet between thunder we could hear our neighbour upstairs talking to his broom as if it were a colleague. Nerida stood at the window with the mesh making a grid across her face and told me, in a voice that had to keep picking up its hem, about a code blue that had not resolved the way the manual promises, and about the mother who had made a sound like tin when the news landed. We watched the rain reorganize the jacaranda’s opinion of itself and we kissed, finally, not because the lightning told us to be dramatic but because our mouths had learned enough patience to earn a small impatient act. It was a kiss that belonged to people who wash their cups before they speak. It was not a declaration; it was not a conquest. It was a quiet alignment of two instruments in the same room, checking their tuning against one another until the note ceased to wobble.

The next day our street was full of leaves that had fled and regretted nothing, and the power boys stood around a hole telling it, not unkindly, to behave. A ute had reversed into a light pole the previous evening in the new slick, and we watched two men shake hands in a way that forgave everyone. Nerida went to the hospital with a half-smile and a bun that looked like it had been sculpted by someone late for work and came home with stories that were mostly about small joys: a girl who had named every plaster in the box, a cleaner who had hung a Christmas garland in October and had told management it was an early intervention. We went to the pool at Austinmer again and watched the lanes make order out of the remains of the storm, and I counted her breaths as she moved and forgot to worry about counting because sometimes the body doing its job is the story and you don’t need to narrate.

Tasos called with a tone that mechanics use when they have found a problem you already knew in your heart. He said the front rotors were scored in a way that told a history, and that if we changed them now, we would not have a story later with sirens in it. He said he could find the parts for less if we gave him two days and perhaps a cake. It seemed we had become the kind of people who bought safety with sugar, and I like a world where that exchange is still honoured. We said yes. Nerida, who is stubborn about money in a way that keeps her head above and also makes her shoulders ache, let me be the sort of partner who can contribute without being thanked in a way that makes him into a hero. “You will not get a plaque,” she said, tearing paper from a bag to line a cake tin. “You will get brakes. That is the genre.” I saluted the genre and brought her the lemon zester because the kitchen is a battlefield where we fight on the same side.

The hospital ran a debrief with a man who had a voice you would pay to read the news and the patience of someone who had seen chairs thrown and had ducked only when necessary. Nerida came home from it lighter and made a sandwich like an apology to herself. She said they had drawn a map of a shift and charted where people got lost and where they found their way back by accident. I liked that they had used paper and pens and had made arrows and had said things like “we will try a note on the door” as if the door might have been the problem all along. I told her the steelworks had e‑stops and that perhaps we could install one in our corridor, somewhere above the light switch, the big red button you hit when the brain decides to rehearse the noise of brakes failing. She said she had one in her pocket now, disguised as a hand. “It’s yours,” she said, “and mine, and whichever of us remembers first.”

We walked to Puckeys at dusk on the day the Corolla came home with new parts that made us both stand taller. The creek, having negotiated with the ocean for centuries and likely tired of the contract, still kept its half of the bargain with an elegance that makes you trust it anyway. The stranger from the bench was there without his lanyarded entourage. He had a haircut that made his ears look shocked and a shirt that forgave him his shoulders. He nodded to us in a way that included none of the old flinch. “Right,” he said, which is a word Australians give dozens of duties, and he smiled at Nerida the way people smile when they recognize someone who has seen them at their worst and did not make them perform gratitude. He told us, in a handful of sentences that had been chosen with care, that he was going to a place near the hill for a while where the days would have schedules. He said this without romance and without sarcasm, which is a difficult trick. We wished him good weather and good bacon and beds that do not squeak when you decide to remain. He said, “Stay,” in demonstration, and the three of us stood there looking at the water like we had invented it.

At Dot’s, the scones had names now, because naming things gives you leverage against their departure. One was “Friday,” because you can taste the weekend in it, and one was “Ian” because once a man named Ian had eaten three and left a note that Dot kept in the sugar tin because it made her feel like a café. We listened to Corey talk about a near-miss with a car door while hauling a parcel that said FRAGILE in a font that had no respect for the word, and Dot told him to buy a high-visibility vest that made him look like a traffic cone with ambitions, and he did, and he wore it, and we felt we had saved one small man for one small day. Finn arrived with a scar on his elbow that was trying to be a story, and we asked for its version, and his version was heroic in exactly the way a boy’s story should be, and he left with icing sugar on his lip like an honour. Nerida sat with her hands around a mug and looked the way people look when their body has begun to believe them again. “I think,” she said, and then let the sentence rest like a bird. “I think I can drive to Corrimal tomorrow. And back.” I made my face do the thing that looks like ordinary encouragement and all the fireworks lit off inside my chest where no one had to sweep up afterwards.

We tried on a plan for a weekend away as if it were a shirt in a charity shop—you don’t know if it will suit you until you see yourself in it, and the mirror is never honest. Berry, maybe, because it has a bakery that believes in its own myth and a green where a man once told me he had never seen a cloud he disliked. Or Kiama again, to be loyal. Or somewhere entirely foolish like Gerringong, because the name itself makes your mouth contract and then widen. Money said one thing and rosters said another. The car, newly proud of its stopping, offered us the road like a handshake you can trust. We spread a map on my table like two children who had been told the world was flat and a secret. We drew a circle with a tea cup and declared our jurisdiction, and we understood that staying can include leaving if the line between them is handled kindly.

At night the mesh on my window made its music again, a low hum like a cheap instrument performing above its pay grade, and the kettle clicked and then sat quietly, like an animal that knows when it is done. The paragraphs on my desk arranged themselves into a queue and I let them be. I wrote a scene in which the gentleman buys brakes with sugar and a woman calls a flame a yes because her friend has reminded her. I wrote a boy landing a trick and missing it on purpose so he can learn the pleasure of trying again with witnesses, and a dog deciding not to herd the ocean after all because leadership includes restraint. I wrote the word stay three times and left two of them in the margins because it is not a word you spend lavishly. When I put down the pencil, the world did not improve, exactly, but it made a sound in its throat that I recognized as co‑operation.

On the morning we went to Corrimal and back we practiced in the carpark first because ritual helps. The light lay low and made the white lines on the asphalt into guidance from a god we might actually obey. Nerida took us onto Princes with a face that gave nothing away to anyone who wasn’t allowed to see. We did not talk much because conversation is expensive on certain routes. She indicated with fidelity to metronome, and I held my breath at the crest the way a person does when a song nears a key change. We touched fifty and then sixty and then seventy and then came down like sensible people. She parked outside a store that sold eight kinds of bucket and one kind of miracle mop, and we sat there with our seat belts resting like medals on our chests, and she looked at me with an incredulity that had earned the right to be pride. “There,” she said, in the smallest possible voice that can still be heard. “There.” I did not say I knew she could. I did not say we would do it again, although we would. I said, “Stay,” very quietly, and she did, and then we went in and bought a miraculous mop, because you must give the day its souvenirs.

A week later, Dot asked if I would help her carry boxes for the church fête, those boxes that smell like attics and perfume decisions, and at the hall we met a man with a table of coins spread out like a modest galaxy. He had albums with corners rubbed thin and stories about the dates stamped on circles that had paid for cigarettes and bus fares and once a dog for a girl who had never asked for a dog and had loved it properly. I thought about the addict on the corner with his Norwegian five‑krone and how currency collects narrative whether it wants to or not. The coin man showed me a penny with a gouge in it where someone had tried to make a hole and had changed their mind, and I bought it because it looked like something that had learned restraint at the last minute. When I got home Nerida held it between finger and thumb and conjured a history that had a woman in a kitchen saying no gently and a boy deciding to listen, and I put the coin in the bowl where I keep keys and faith.

We stood a lot that week, in doorways and on steps and under trees that agreed to be roofs, and spoke softly about ordinary things like pillows and jars and the sudden onset of beetles and about the less ordinary thing of being brave in small measurable increments. We did not make it into a triumph each time. Sometimes she drove around the block and came home and we called it a loop and that was what it was. Sometimes we walked to the servo at nine at night because two ice creams are the only answer to a question that cannot be asked properly. Sometimes she stood with her hands on the bench and said, “I can feel the brakes in my chest,” and I stood at the sink with the water running too long and said, “Press,” and we did, on the tiles and in our own bodies, and afterwards the floor remembered us and the day did not mind.

I do not know if there is a chapter in a life you can call solved. There are only the sections where a person’s name fits more comfortably in their own mouth and where the kettle boils when it is told, and where a man who calls himself Rambone because the world once decided to bend his syllables learns to let his attention make dents that are not wounds. I am, at this writing, a man with a jacket and a ledger and a window that insists upon its humming. I count to four and then to sixteen and then I stop because enough is enough. The escarpment stands behind me like a spine and the ocean rehearses the only story it knows, and in the kitchen there are two cups turned upside down on a towel because we have learned that drying is part of the ritual, and on the hook there is a cardigan that is not mine, and in the bowl there are keys that mean I can enter and I can pause and I can stay.Spring had the courtesy to linger instead of sprinting headlong into heat, and in that gentler weather our conversations grew a second skin, something that could handle being outdoors without getting sunburnt. The flyer that had made a religion out of the steelworks' e‑stops still lived on our fridge beneath a magnet shaped like a whale, and when I went to pour milk the corner of it tapped my wrist like a reminder that machines can be designed to fail safely. Nerida stood with her back to the sink, elbows braced, hair making its own decisions around her face, and announced with the ceremonial gravity of a person calling a meeting to order that she wanted to drive to Berry. The word wore bakery sugar even in our kitchen. She said it having already done the private arithmetic; you could hear the answer in the way her shoulders set. The map was folded into a geometry Mrs. Khan would approve of. We opened it flat on the table and the paper exhaled like a captive released. I traced the coast road with my finger as if we were children who believed fingers could tell the future; she circled a rest stop with a biro as if to say, here is where we let the body change its mind.

We left early enough to be greeted by birds rather than trucks, and the Corolla made a good-natured hum that suggested its new brakes had decided to trust us. I packed the sort of bag men pack when they are delighted by practicality: lemon wrapped in paper, two cups wrapped in tea towel, a jar of sugar and a knife in a sheath that looked like a moral. She took charge of the radio and then turned it off deliberately, as if she needed the road to hear her thinking. On the rise past Windang the lake lay like a plate someone had chosen for company, and Nerida spoke to her own hands under her breath in a language that was all verbs—steady, breathe, check, breathe—and if it was a prayer it was the kind that believes in doing dishes afterward. The signs with black kangaroos leaping against yellow were sermons she did not require, and the few trucks we met wore their patience like hi-vis. When the tarp of a stock crate ahead flapped loose and worried the corner of our lane she took her foot to the brake with the exactness of a person applying a bandage, and the car obeyed; the trucker’s arm appeared, brown and sheepish in his window, and signalled an apology that went straight into our ledger under the column labelled People Trying.

We pulled in at Gerroa where the view rehearses grandeur for anyone merciful enough to look up. The wind came at us with a childhood pocketful of sand and laughter and we stood side by side with our jackets making us look like officials from a small country that had resolved to be kind. She leaned her hip against the bonnet with an intimacy that would have embarrassed a less confident car. “I didn’t forget how to stop,” she said, not proud and not astonished, but as if she were reading the result of a test she had not realized she had already sat. I sliced the lemon with the knife that behaves as if its point were newspaper-friendly and we dipped wedges in sugar like kids who had escaped supervision. The sugar made a geography on the bonnet that I wiped with the heel of my hand, leaving a smear of sweetness as if to say, we were here and we meant no harm. We ate until the backs of our teeth complained and then we laughed at that too, at the small injustices we ask our bodies to forgive. A magpie with a more vertical opinion than most stalked the grass in front of us, looked disdainfully at our bootleg voided scones, and went about his day, and the stuffed one on her dash, rehomed after its hospital duty, peered at us as if jealous.

Berry was all bunting and sincerity. The donut van performed its secular liturgy, oil hissing, bags puffing in hands like tiny clouds. Nerida bought a paper bag that already showed its intentions in grease and we sat on the low stone wall under a tree with a name like honesty, sugar busting its way onto our clothes without shame. We watched a couple attempt to negotiate a pram through the sort of crowd that thinks it isn’t one, and an older man attempt to pay for a jar of pickled onions with a $2 coin collection that was as much story as currency. We browsed a stall where an old woman sold bowls that looked like the sky when birds are feeling formal. Nerida picked one up, blue inside with a ring of white like a pause, and turned it in her hands with the attention she gives to cups; she set it down and picked up another and then returned to the first with a decisiveness that makes markets honest. “For your lemon,” she said, and I paid because sometimes money is a ribbon you tie around a day so you don’t lose it at the back of the drawer.

The motel smelled like bleach that had been told to behave itself and carpet cleaner that had been told nothing at all. We stood in a room with less personality than my kettle and we gave it some: her cardigan on a chair, my jacket on a hook, our two cups on the sill because all window ledges want to audition as shelves. The kettle there clicked with a shyness that made me forgive its age, and the tea it produced tasted like the water had lived less interesting lives than ours, but we said yes to it because hospitality is a circle you draw that also includes yourself. We lay on a bedspread whose pattern pretended to be uninterested in our narrative and we watched the ceiling find its level. It wasn’t romance the way posters sell it; it was the kind where a person closes their eyes because someone else is in the room and the room therefore becomes a home. We kissed with the patience of a ledger that knows the month is long and the numbers will add if you don’t hurry them. She fell asleep with her hand just touching my sleeve, the smallest anchorage, and I counted to sixteen and then to four and then to eight, not because numbers were in charge but because sometimes a mind likes the discipline of squares.

On the second morning the bakery near the green made a case for gluttony in a way that would have shamed a better man, and I failed to be better. We ate long bread like ceremony and bought a jar of jam that bragged about raspberries and it turned out to deserve its brag. In the antique shop that smells like old paper and furniture decisions I found a picture frame that had outlived its occupant and told myself we were not collecting ghosts. Nerida flirted with a coat that had belonged to a woman who had believed in weatherproofing and chose against it only because the pockets were liars. When we got to the car there was chalk on the road from someone’s child who had drawn hopscotch with ambition, double squares where convention would have been safer. We played two rounds with more seriousness than a sensible pair should, and I tried and failed to step lightly enough into ten to avoid leaving my whole weight. She told me I was a fielder, not a jumper, and when I lifted my eyebrows she said, “You catch,” and I accepted the compliment because we have decided to spend ours out loud.

On the way home the sky remembered it could be a curtain and not a ceiling, and the first drops hit the windscreen with the quiet insolence of rain that doesn’t need to make an announcement. The wipers did their negotiated dance and I watched her watch the space between swipes, the way careful drivers measure faith. A sedan ahead of us took a corner as if reconsidering a marriage and Nerida made a tiny corrective movement that in another life might have been the beginning of a pirouette and here was nothing more than a woman deciding to keep to her lane. We pulled over in a lay-by near a sign that advised us about wildlife that could not read, and the rain made the kind of sound on the roof that makes you behave. She flexed her fingers as if removing invisible rings, blew out through her nose, and laughed the way people laugh in church when the baby does something outrageous. “I’ve forgotten to be afraid for three whole minutes,” she said, amazed as if she’d actually misplaced an object, and then she put her hands on the wheel as if she had found it under a magazine. I had the thought that I could drive the last bit home and the thought made my blood behave like a crowd faced with a fire exit—hope and chaos. My hands, traitors to a very old pact, itched for the familiar geometry of the wheel. I told her I would take the car from the lay-by to the pump to see what the world does when I pretend I trust it. She turned off the engine and we swapped places with the levity of people changing seats in a movie; the rain agreed not to perform any surprises while I was in rehearsal.

Sitting behind the wheel was like returning to a room after years away and finding your own handwriting on the walls in a language you can almost read. I wrapped my hands around the circle and the skin there remembered. The car smelt of eucalyptus oil from a wipe that had had ambitions and her lemon soap and the honest fabric of the seats; nothing here held the metallic taste of that other night. I started the engine and the Corolla said, politely, what would you like? I let the foot engage its muscle memory and moved us forward the kind of distance that lovers use to describe closeness, a series of whispers of motion, and then braked. It was a brake like a good sentence ending, not a stop that makes your teeth claim union rights. I did it again, more to prove that I could break my own rule than to move us anywhere significant, and then I put the gear in park and sat back as if I had been holding a violin between my teeth. I told her about the dog because if you are going to be brave for only five minutes it should be used for something besides self-congratulation. The paddock, the joy, the sound an animal makes when it answers a terrible question, the farmer with the spanner and the old man’s mercy, my hands that smelt like copper for a day, my car that had been a thing for taking me to other people and had become a room I couldn’t be in alone. I spoke the way you loosen a knot that has made a life in your hands. She listened with an attention that would have saved cities if offered in time. She did not put her hand on me as if to press the story back into my chest. She kept her eyes on the wipers because you cannot hold another person’s pain and drive without taking your hands from what they must do. “We’ll let that be what it was,” she said when I had run out of verbs, which is not forgiveness and not rationalization and not erasure. It is the adult version of laying down your cheek against the floorboards and saying, yes, this is our house, and the floor answers with its ordinary wooden heartbeat.

Back in town, the library announced a night with emerging voices, which is the way institutions pronounce courage without risking their prestige. Dot had seen the notice before I had and had already written my name down in a hand the librarian described as forthright. “You will be the third,” she said to me over the returns desk with the gravity of a person who knows the rule of threes is not superstition but a practical arrangement for attention spans. The thought of standing behind a lectern made my ribs behave as if they had been given new roles. Nerida, who had been a student of the night and therefore had opinions about what people should do with their evenings, rested her chin on her fist and said it would be good to hear the town described to itself by someone who didn’t treat it like a postcard. I polished my shoes until I could see my wrong face in them, the one that looks braver, and put on my honest jacket and put a pencil behind my ear because I am the sort of man who wants to be ready to fix anything, even a comma, while I am being watched.

The library room had the carpet of serious civic gatherings and the scent of 800 books that were waiting for us to catch up. People came because books are polite hosts; they brought the hush they wear to funerals and then shed it when they realized the dead were not in charge. Corey arrived with his high‑vis rolled to his waist and sat in the back beside a poster about cycling safety that looked as if it had been designed by an earnest algorithm. Finn came because there was promise of lemon slice and left his board outside under the eye of a librarian who could have disarmed a war with an index finger. Mrs. Khan and her husband took the front row with the air of sponsors, and Dot sat dead centre the way only people who trust their chairs do. Nerida took a spot at the end of my line of sight where I could find her face when I needed to remind myself that one person knowing your name is as good as all of them clapping. I read a piece in which a man polishes his stove because he needs something in his house to keep its promises, and I read a piece in which a woman calls a flame a yes, and when I said the word “stay” aloud, the room breathed in the way rooms do when they recognize themselves. The applause arrived exactly on time, kind but not reverent, and someone asked me afterwards if I was from here and I said yes with the complicated honesty of people who only learned their hometown later than their birth.

Outside the automatic doors a drizzle was practicing being rain and failing, which is the drizzle’s favourite pastime. A small car reversed where it shouldn’t and a cyclist went still as sculpture, just as he had outside the pharmacy two weeks earlier, and I watched Nerida’s body make the tiniest prelude to a panic she then did not choose. She put two fingers to the hollow at the base of her throat as if pressing the e‑stop that we had put there with the authority of a man from the steelworks, and she walked to the driver’s window without making the driver feel three inches tall. “Hey,” she said, using the tone nurses have in the small hours when men wake up in beds that do not belong to them. “This is one way,” and the driver, who might have been thinking about a bill or a childhood or the thirst of a cactus, nodded and became immediately better. The cyclist shook his head like a wet dog and then pedalled off with his dignity folded back in. We stood, the two of us, under the overhang with lemon slice on napkins and my whole body full of the relief you get when you discover that your carefulness is useful in daylight as well as in the rooms where you count.

In the weeks that followed, I learned to sit in the driver’s seat in our car in the light with the door open and the engine off and this was practice, and this did count. Sometimes we swapped at the lights when the roads were empty of everyone except people who had loans on their utes and didn’t have time for our narrative, and I let my hands hold the roundness while the Corolla hummed the key of on and I participated in the world without moving through it faster than walking. Nerida slid the seat back when she got in after me with a flourish that turned the adjustment into a friendly joke, and she kept her grin soft so I wouldn’t mistake it for impatience. We bought from the chemist a piece of elastic designed to keep children from opening doors and used it instead to keep the glovebox from throwing theatrics, and we called it our humility strap. The stranger from the servo sent, via a woman from the bus stop who had a way with envelopes, a postcard with a picture of a lake that looked nothing like the ones we know; he had written three sentences in a schoolboy hand that said more than entire letters I have received from people with postgraduate degrees. He said the days had a rhythm and that one of the men in his unit was teaching him to make bread because kneading is a way of talking that doesn’t require eye contact. He said, “See you,” and we understood that this was the brave version of stay, and we put the card on the fridge where our magnets performed their quiet duty.

At the hospital, the physio invited partners to a lecture cunningly titled Mechanics of Calm, and twenty of us sat behind a trolley with a model spine on it that had seen better metaphors. The physio was the sort of woman who could get a dog to lower its heart rate by asking and had hands that demonstrated breathing as if she were kneading dough. Nerida gripped my thumb under the chair in that rhythm we had invented at the last seminar and we learned, among other things, that muscles tell lies in which they star as prophets and that you can reward a body for changing its mind. Driving is like that, the physio said, and I wanted to call out, Yes, and also writing, and also getting out of bed on days where the mesh sings worry instead of air. We drove home in the late sun with less theatre and more choreography, and at the final roundabout I felt her shoulders drop not because something had let go but because she had decided to hold differently.

There are days when a person lives inside the interesting part of a graph and there are days when the line lies flat and asks nothing of you and those can be holy. On one of the latter we reorganized the drawer with the tea towels and found, at the bottom, the remnant of an old calendar with square boxes I had once filled with obligations that had not made me a better man. We cut it into grocery lists because paper wants purpose. We took the rosemary out to the front and showed it how it was meant to be pruned, a little rude to make it honest. The magpies came to negotiate the contract of spring and decided I was not a threat this year and sang in a way that made my own throat itch with wanting to join. Finn practiced an ollie and fell and then lay on the grass as if considering his entire career, and we shouted, Not bad, with a sincerity that probably saved him from despair for five minutes, which is an excellent ratio. Dot appeared with a tin and the news that she had joined a choir for reasons that would be revealed later and we pretended to audition in the street and passed because the day understood what we were doing and conferred grace.

The habit of counting returned sometimes like a friend who does not always warn before dropping in. I found myself at the kitchen table tapping out fours and sixteens while the kettle learned our timings and the mesh found the note of the breeze, and I let it be a metronome rather than a compulsion. Nerida, who had developed a relationship with fear that looked not unlike good parenting, stood sometimes in a doorway with her hands on either frame as if making a human e‑stop, and said, aloud and unembarrassed, No thank you, to the part of her brain that wanted to run rehearsal footage of crashing in high definition. Small children on our street performed dramas in which their plastic cars collided with much ceremony and none of the physics, and we borrowed from them the honesty that comes with false alarms. When her shift was bad while still being technically fine, she came home with coffee she forgot to hand to me and a tiredness that separated her sentences into islands, and we put the cups down, and we made pasta with confidence, and we called a truce with the day because the day, like a union, responds to a good-faith negotiation.

It took an old man named Ian, the very one the scone was named for, to remind me that I had a father buried up on the hill past where the grass gets itchy, the way only certain grasses do when the dead are nearby. I had been supervising my grief like a lazy manager, trusting it to show up without a roster, and Ian said without sentiment that he visited on Tuesdays and talked to his wife about the price of fuel and the foolishness of gulls and felt better for it. I took a bus the size of a confession and walked the last bit because at the end, and at the beginning, you should arrive on your own legs. The marker was practical and did not make fuss. I stood there in my good jacket because you must show respect in the language the person understood, and I put my hand on the sandstone like a man blessing a kettle and I told him about brakes and sugar and men with lanyards and the way a woman’s hand on your sleeve in a motel can make your ribcage decide to be kind. I told him I had begun to allow dents. The wind said the thing wind always says in places like that, which is less a sentence than a presence, and I walked down the hill with my pockets full of the correct stones.

At home, Nerida was seated on the step with the new bowl on her knees holding its lemon with the posture of something nominated for a small prize. She looked up and saw whatever my face was telling her and shuffled sideways on the step so I could sit without having to mention any of it. She did not ask me to describe the hill or the stone or the old man’s name, and in that not asking she gave me space in which the story could grow into itself without being handled. We watched a boy from two doors down chase a hat that had decided to become a frisbee, and a girl from across the street practice walking backwards until her mother shouted Forwards, please, this is not a stunt show, and the girl turned around like a person more polite than most adults. The steelworks’ moan got its afternoon melancholy just right and the birds rehearsed a few lines of tomorrow’s argument, and the air that came through the jasmine was reasonable.

We went to bed that night with the kitchen deeply tidy as if the day had needed to be reminded that things can end lined up, and in the dark we lay facing the ceiling because even in companionship you sometimes address your prayers to architecture. Nerida reached for my hand in a way that discovered it rather than hunted it, and we let our fingers find the old rhythm. “I used to think staying meant pretending I was not a person who might leave,” she said into the space above us where the mesh grids turn shadow into pattern. “Now I think it means admitting I could leave and choosing not to.” I said I had believed leaving and staying were decisions you submit to like court orders, and that I had come to enjoy the work in them, the tiny signatures you put on your day as if it were a form worth filing properly. We did not sleep immediately because the kettle clicked in my mind and asked if it was needed and I said not yet, and then later yes, and then much later, when the birds had started their shift and the steelworks had switched from lament to industry, we slept in the way people do when they have boiled the water twice and found in the repetition a comfort that has nothing to do with thirst.

In the morning, just before the street broke into its usual self, I found the note from the library under our door. It had been slid by a hand that would have excelled at stealing hats and returning them with increased style. They wanted more pieces. They wanted to print one in the local news rag whose pages we normally read for the advertisements and the funerals. The phrase honorarium was used in a sentence with a number that couldn’t buy brakes and could buy a plant, and I laughed in the kitchen because money always thinks it is tricking someone and it was not today. I wrote back on the calendar remnant and pinned it to the tea towel so I would not forget to take it down to the librarian with the weaponized index finger. Nerida, hair wet and face doing a new weather I didn’t yet recognize, kissed my cheek with the firmness of a stamp and said, There, which I have learned is the right word for a lot of beginnings and a lot of middles and almost all of the ends. Outside the lorikeets had opinions, the escarpment turned its back and then did not, the steelworks cleared its throat, and my window’s mesh tuned itself to the key of our day and held it long enough for the kettle to do its honest work and stop when asked.The paper came on a wind that made the letterbox thwack its own cheek, and there, misplaced among lawnmowers and condolences and a photograph of a Labrador rehomed with urgency, sat my paragraph in print. The font gave my sentences a haircut they had not asked for, and my name wore itself like a borrowed tie. Mrs. Khan circled the piece in biros of two different colours as if marking an exam whose answers she already knew, and pushed the clipping across the counter with the same hand that chooses loaves for men too shy to ask for the good bread. Dot came down the path and waved the paper as if I had been elected to a post in a small country and she was my only constituent with budget oversight. “It’s got bones,” she said, and I could not help but hear my ridiculous name in that praise, and I felt my cheeks perform a childhood trick. Nerida read the paragraph in the kitchen with the lemon bowl sitting there as if supervising, and she smiled in stages, the way a sunrise does when clouds have asked to be included. “You didn’t round the corners,” she said, which is enough for a writer to be fed for a week. “You put the edges where they had to be and then left them be.” I told her that printing gives a sentence the authority of a uniform, and she said uniform or not, the words still have to do the job when the room is noisy.

In the week the paper lived on our fridge and our friends used it to point at my name as if that would change how vowels behaved, the hospital decided to remind everyone what profession they were in. Nerida did a run of shifts that made the moon a clock with bad advice, and when she came home her pockets had collected the lint of a hundred small emergencies. She poured out stories the way you tip sand from shoes after the beach—so much, so fine, so everywhere. A boy learned how to climb a bed with machines attached and his mother learned how to watch without becoming the police. A man woke with his mouth dry and his eyes already arguing and said sorry to the nurse nearest because apologies look for the first open door. An orderley wrote Stay on a whiteboard by accident while meaning to write the name of a drug that also begins with S, and the word stayed there until someone with a strictness for lists took pity and wiped it, and in the wiping the day lost a small blessing. We ate standing up on those nights, cold pasta balanced on the edge of usefulness, and kept from falling in love with the drama of it by laughing at the household objects we had turned into equipment.

Driving became something in our week like sweeping—a task that if ignored made the floor dishonest. We did loops around blocks with magnolias performing smugly, and Nerida put the car into reverse with the authority of a woman making a pie. The new brakes announced themselves without boasting and the pedal learned to be a door and not a cliff. Sometimes we put on the radio and let old songs choose us because it is rude, after a certain age, to pretend you have not already been instructed in joy. Sometimes we drove to a street we had both been saving—the one with the steep bit that makes your stomach practice being a bird—and we sat at the top pretending to admire a house that had planted rosemary without moderation while inside us the old tapes voted against descent. “Just to the corner,” she said, as if bargaining with a child, and down we went, the car making proofs with every rotation, the hill agreeing that if we respected gravity it would return the courtesy. At the bottom we laughed not because fear had been humiliated but because it had bothered to show up and we had bothered to be taller.

My mother rang with the kind of timing only mothers and wrong numbers possess. She did not say that she had been thinking of me because that would be a faith I could not deny; she said the flyscreen on her kitchen window had given up its promise and could I bring my hands and the little wheel that pushes spline into corners and make the summer less porous. She lives in a house that remembers the shape of my sulks, on a street where the grass has opinions about shoes, and I pictured us both there moving carefully around each other as if carrying soup. “Bring your girl if she’s not pretending to be busy,” she added, and I could hear the grin hitch a ride on the consonants. I told her we would come on Saturday when the morning could be told what to do, and hung up and felt my ribs try on a shirt they had not worn since the funeral and found it less restricting than expected.

We packed the Corolla as if the drive were a ceremony and had protocols. The lemon bowl had to stay home because rituals must not become ridiculous, but the spline tool went into my pocket as if it were a talisman, and we folded the spare mesh in a careful accordion that made even my tidy heart satisfied. The road to my mother’s is an unremarkable series of decisions, but each bend held the ghost of a version of myself who had once taken it sulking or laughing or late. Nerida drove there as if telling the car a story it had asked for, and she narrated her hands’ decisions under her breath in that verb-language I had come to trust. Past the roundabout a blue-tongue lizard chose the white line for his pilgrimage, and we stopped so precisely we could have been using graph paper, and the lizard’s ancient face told us he had not needed our respect but would include it in the record. We watched him collect himself and his ridiculous tongue and finish his foolish, admirable journey, and then we went on, both of us a little braver for having been kind to a creature that owed us nothing.

My mother greeted us in her door as if the frame were a piano and she had decided on the note. Her hair has made its peace with the weather, and her hands are still the kind that can turn a jar lid by arguing with it in a language other lids cannot learn. She put Nerida to work with authority disguised as hospitality—teatowels in a stack, a question about whether the jam had enough set, a story about the neighbour’s fence that demanded a nod on the third beat—and left me at the sink with the torn mesh as if she had placed a patient in my care. We pulled the old spline from its channel in a grey, satisfied coil that spoke of summers with their moths admitted and admitted until no one had the energy to object, and we laid the new mesh over the frame so it draped like black water with behaviour. The roller clicked in its round, neat way, and each press tucked the boundary back where it belonged. My mother watched from a chair with her elbows on her knees and gave advice only at the exact moment advice was not insulting. “Corners,” she said, when I arrived at the part of any job where a man is tempted to lie, and I turned the mesh with care like a page in a book we would both have to re-read.

There is a moment in replacing a screen when the pattern becomes music and your eye wants to follow the squares into a trance. Nerida came up beside me and put a finger on the mesh and plucked it very softly, and it made a tiny sound like a refusal made polite, and we laughed as if we had been given the punchline to a joke we’d been waiting on for years. My mother, who understands rituals because she invented most of mine, put cups next to our elbows at exactly the time the job needed tea, and told us about a girl she had seen at the bus stop moving forward and backward across the same piece of pavement as if practicing a trick only she knew the nature of, and of the way a man at the chemist had paid with coins wrapped in paper that said the names of the coins on the outside as if he didn’t trust his own memory. When the spline sat snug all around and the mesh looked like a law respected again, my mother rose and pressed the heel of her hand against the screen and said, “Stop,” not to us, but to the air, and the air agreed, and we all felt, for three seconds, gloriously municipal.

Afterwards, because some foods make your hands learn different verbs, we rolled dolmades under my mother’s supervision—vine leaves unmarred by holes, rice with its salt learned to be reasonable, lemon resting nearby waiting to be called upon like a god you know will attend. Nerida’s fingers, which have learned how to dress wounds in a way that does not make the skin feel failed, made neat little cigars that would shame a show-off, and my mother watched those thumbs with an expression I could not pretend I didn’t recognise. Families try to adopt your loves without startling them. We ate with our backs to the late light, and my mother asked Nerida about her ward with the cunning of a cat crossing a fence, and Nerida spoke in paragraphs that protected people while also telling the truth, and my mother nodded at the exact places where the sentences needed nods. Before we left, the jar cupboard found me because houses teach you their habits, and my mother put a jar of preserved lemons into Nerida’s hand in a ceremony that could have been performed in any religion, and Nerida said thank you in a tone that did not make light of fruit that had been persuaded into keeping.

We drove home with the same care but different ballast, the car having met part of my past and chosen not to gossip. At the bend where the light likes to make people think the road is more honest than it is, a kangaroo thought better of a decision and jumped wrong-footed into a story he didn’t understand. We were already slower than the men behind us preferred, and the brakes did the kind of work you only appreciate if you have once been in a life where work is not honoured. We stopped short enough that my hand did the old, useless bar across Nerida’s chest, and she put her palm to the back of my wrist with the exact pressure of forgiveness and said, “It’s alright,” and the men behind us held their anger like hot cups and then, to their credit, put it down. The roo bounded away with more luck than education and the day put its hands back in its pockets and looked at the sky as if to say, we are ridiculous and we endure.

The servo stranger sent another card, this time from a small place with a name that wanted to be said aloud. The lake on the front was glossy and the sky on it looked like someone had ironed it. He wrote about a man in his unit who could pull a rope through a knot backward in a way that would make sailors doubt themselves, and a dog that visited on Wednesdays with a jacket that made her shy, and about sleep coming like a bus sometimes—you wait and wait and then two arrive and you cannot take them both. He said he had put his hands in flour and they had come out kinder, which he did not expect. He said, “I’ll be back,” and that sentence landed on our fridge with its feet planted and looked around like a person taking stock. We told Dot that he wrote and she said she had been keeping three slices of cake in her freezer for a month on the off chance of a reason, and we gave her the card to look at and she held it with both hands as if she had been trusted with a fragile machine.

The librarian with the index finger that could hush a war asked me, in a whisper that could lift sail, if I had more, and I had, because words breed when you sleep if you give them adequate water. I wrote the piece about the man at the corner who raised his hand in apology and made it too big, about the way forgiveness looks when performed for an audience, about the way a hand at a window can be both a signal and a salve. I let a knife in that time and cut a sentence exactly where it had tried to smuggle a lie, and I was not gentle with myself in the editing, which felt like learning a new scale. Nerida read it with a pencil in her hand and put no marks and three checkmarks at the bottom as if awarding a pass to the work and not to me. We walked the page down to the library like two children taking a secret to be sealed and the librarian took it with professional solemnity, which is to say her eyes softened and her mouth did not, and said she would like to keep the knife sharp for the room.

On a Thursday that had mislaid its energy we went to the concert hall where Dot’s choir was presenting spring songs in jumpers they had knitted by accident by washing mistakes. The choir director was a kind woman who looked like a warning about trifles and told us we were permitted to sing along only if we knew the words, which is the world’s threshold for so many things. Dot kept her eyes on the music as if reading the weather and lifted her chin like a woman being measured for a hat. They sang about staying as if it were a place you could write to, and about leaving as if it were a boat you wave at from a wharf you always meant to bring fruit to. Finn, unaccustomed to sitting still, played his own percussion on the underside of his chair in a way only we could hear, and Mrs. Khan cried at a descant that reminded her of a radio in Lahore that never quite tuned perfectly. On the way out, under the corridor’s fluorescent honesty, a woman I didn’t know took my hand and said my piece had helped her not swear at a driver that morning and I said the driver would thank me too, and we both laughed because the world is too large for neat cause and effect and also too small to deny them.

The week brought its small disasters the way a storm brings its first leaves. A shelf in our kitchen decided to become a floor and everything it had been trusted with arrived at ankle height, jars with convictions, spices with a sense of their own importance. We stood and looked at the disaster together because that is the only way to convince a mess it is an event and not a personality. Nerida found the screwdriver I lose twice a week and put the bracket right with her tongue between her teeth in a concentration I have seen save rooms, and I swept and made a pile of cumin that will scent our house until Christmas. Later, because we had survived a domestic scenario without blaming the shelf for our own laziness, we rewarded ourselves with ice cream from the servo and watched a boy try to smuggle a slushie out in his jacket and be caught by a cashier with a direct line to his better self. “Mate,” she said, that Australian sermon in a syllable, and the boy replaced the cup and left with dignity and fewer sugars and we loved the cashier for knowing which kind of sternness to spend.

The day after shelves and sermons we practiced night driving in the safe part of town where the streets hold their own breath. Darkness changes the recipe of a road; shapes become rumours and reflectors adopt the voice of authority. Nerida took to it like someone accepting she could be ambidextrous after a lifetime of insisting her left hand was ornamental. She listed aloud the lights she was trusting, made a rosary of give way signs, named her gratitude to each green as if it were a person. I sat as quiet as a man whose job is to secure the weather and let my body be heavy where she could use that weight to believe in physics. At the T-intersection near the school where the flags have arguments in wind we stopped for a cat who didn’t need us, and I thought about how many times I had wanted someone to stop for me when I did not need them, and how I resented it then and would thank them now. When we returned to our street the jasmine made its case for endurance and the steelworks’ moan had become a purr, and I felt the mesh at the window hum its careful, small song and knew I would sleep.

Not all nights reward your good behaviour by staying quiet. One cracked the silence open with an argument two doors down, voices in the key of exhaustion making declarative statements they would wake up ashamed of. Nerida sat up and put her feet on the floor with the immediate readiness of a nurse called at three and I pressed her shoulder back to the bed because this was not our alarm. We listened for a breaking, the mortal kind, and when none came we let the words do their ugly pilgrimage out on the pavement where they could teach the air nothing. In the morning the same couple stood with backs bent over a pram, a small canopy of apology extended, and the mother held the baby with the kind of care you only learn by breaking and patching your own heart. We took them scones from Dot by way of a peace offering we were not legally required to make and they received them with the respect due to baked flour, and I thought again how often human life is saved by carbohydrates.

The honorarium bought a plant that did not believe in failure and insisted on being called a philodendron by its posh name. We placed it on the sill and told it which side of itself would be required to thrive and it did as instructed because houseplants respond best to a benevolent dictatorship. The lemon bowl frowned at it until it understood it was a guest and not a replacement. On an afternoon that meant rain but delivered blue instead, we walked up to the mall to buy thread for a shirt that had decided it needed loyalty. A busker with a harmonica made old songs newer than they had any right to be, and a toddler danced by stamping, which is the only honest form of dancing. We went into the haberdashery where everything is labeled in small handwriting and where the woman behind the counter made a case for zips, passionately, and we bought a zip we didn’t need because passion asks only that you notice it.

I don’t pretend there weren’t days where fear arrived like a relative who refuses to call ahead. The road will always have a curve it keeps down its sleeve and your body will remember a story it wasn’t told kindly. One Wednesday the headlights of a ute in our mirror occupied more of the present than they had earned and my hands leapt to the armrest and then away as if stung by a bee from a previous summer. Nerida reached for the indicator not because we had to turn but because sometimes making a small decision reminds the brain who is responsible here, and the ute took his impatient life elsewhere, and my heart learned to remain inside my chest without needing to be told a second time. That night we put our feet on the tiles and pressed with intention until both bodies agreed we were not falling. I wrote later—a paragraph about the absurd dignity of feet—and the pencil behaved like a small animal that wants to please. The page took the weight like a good floor. The kettle did what it always does, and stopped when asked.Heat came in with its shirt unbuttoned, distinguished not by drama so much as repetition. The mornings wore the same gloss and the afternoons gathered the same chorus, cicadas working their stitching endlessly, voices thick as if the air were syrup and our tongues wanted spoons. The kettle sulked on its trivet and took longer to decide to be useful. The mesh sang even when there was no wind, humming at a pitch that says weather is a habit, not an event. Nerida’s basil produced leaves like punctuation and then, bored with itself, paused. The philodendron took the window like a prince who had agreed, for political reasons, to marry down and found contentment. My lemon in its bowl grew a small bright bruise where it had slept against the ceramic too long and we called it character because we have agreed not to be cruel to fruit.

In this easy tyranny of days, the hospital sent an email that had the voice of a polite ultimatum and the word rotation disguised in a paragraph about opportunity. There was a placement on a ward in Shellharbour that wanted a nurse who could invent calm on demand and knew what to do with a vein that hid its intentions. It was the kind of stretch that in another season would have made Nerida say yes first and be practical later. Now the road inside the yes was part of the question. She read the sentence twice with her forefinger underlining the air and then the air underlined her. She said she could take the train and become the sort of person who kissed glass at 7.18 a.m., and then she laughed at herself because the schedule was as likely to behave as a toddler at a wedding. We sat at my table with the map spread open and cups sweating slightly because our kitchen had taken up humidity like a hobby and we traced a route that had more forgiveness than speed. “We’ll practice,” she said, not like a vow, more like a bread recipe you write on the inside of a cupboard door because you intend to use it.

Practice, as ever, turned out to be a ceremony we could adapt to the size of a day. We went in the hour when the white lines on the asphalt glow like rules. Tasos had fitted the new rotors and their invisible circles waited with the patience of saints who know the sermon will be long. We took the ring road around the mall first, the one Dot calls the polite circle because it has never demanded anything of anyone except basic manners. Nerida narrated quietly for herself, her voice on that practical setting she uses for syringes and stubborn cupboards. Indicator. Mirror. Brake. Breathe. I kept my mouth with me, which is not a talent I always possess, and pressed my feet into the floor mat as if the Corolla were a piano we were playing in duet. At a roundabout where a man in a ute failed to use his hand to confess his intentions, she made a decision that would have left an instructor purring and she exhaled in a way that sounded like a prayer learning its own words. Afterwards we bought mangoes and ate them on the step with our hands because fruit should know what we are capable of when we don’t care about stain, and we both had yellow wrists and no regrets.

It is one thing to declare yourself available to new roads and quite another to lend your body to unexpected turns. In the Coles carpark a woman did a wide arc with her trolley as if demonstrating the mathematics of fear and a sedan chose the moment her head turned to aim itself at a bollard with the softness of an apology. The sound it made did not belong to metal or to consequence; it belonged to attention failing at the edge, that small gasp gravity takes when it gets its way. Nerida’s professional self rose without ceremony. She was at the driver’s window with the sort of smile the hospital gives you on your first day and then forgets to reinforce. Are you alright. Do you feel dizzy. Take your time. It’s a bump, not a story. The woman’s hands trembled like she’d been asked to sign for a package that wasn’t hers and Nerida placed a palm on the top of the door not to steady herself but to lend steadiness to the air. I stood on the driver’s blind side making sure nobody was going to convert their impatience into speed. When it was clear the damage was purely civic and easily repaired by paint and breath, we laughed a little, the small grateful laugh of people who have dodged a narrative they cannot afford. The woman said thanks without making a ceremony of it and drove away with her bumper feeling newly mortal. We walked back to our lemon bowl and called that practice, too.

Community took any excuse we offered it to assemble. Dot announced, with the optimism of a woman who measures her seasons in recipes, that we would have a bring-your-own something night at her place because a freezer can only hold so much charity and she’d discovered a surplus of sausage rolls that needed a congregation. People arrived bearing dishes and apologies and one magnificent coleslaw that glittered with pomegranate like a party. Mr. Kosta recited every seed that had contributed to his salad with the pride of a genealogist. Corey came late with wind in his hair and the breathless look of a man who has once again asked the city to be reasonable and been told it would think about it. Finn wore a shirt with an accidental paint handprint that matched his own and landed his plastic plate like a stunt in a film with no budget. Mrs. Khan brought a tray cloth with daisies and an angle of cut cake that said she had cut around the good parts for us. I made lemonade with the authority of an old publican and discovered that sugar is still an efficient currency. Somewhere between the pastry and the category of trifles Dot insisted on calling us a choir and began “Stand by Me” at a tempo that forgave all bodies. We sang the decree because it is better to stand together for the length of a song than to pretend you don’t know where the floor is.

The stranger from the servo did not come but he sent evidence. A boy from the bus stop arrived red-cheeked and earnest with a brown paper parcel damp at the corners and a note written on the back of a photocopied roster. The loaf inside had the weight of intention and the scent of a yeast given a second life by attention and patience. The note said only, “From L. Wednesdays are for bread. Thank you for the word.” We sliced it while it was still more alive than dead and butter pooled and argued and we ate standing, because some foods insist. Nerida read the note twice, that back-of-the-roster scrawl like a prayer written on a napkin, and shook her head in a way I’ve learned is gratitude and a refusal to make it into a moral. We wrapped the heel for Dot’s freezer because Dot believes in keeping endings for later.

On a Tuesday that behaved like a Monday because the bin truck had forgotten us and the lorikeets were rude, Dot went pale in a way that had no romance in it. She was standing in the op shop showing me a dress that had no intention of fitting anyone when her hands let go of their conversation with the fabric and she sat down not neatly. She used a word I don’t enjoy hearing in voices I care for. Dizzy. We went through the well-rehearsed gentle farce of persuasion. Sit. Breathe. Small sips. The chair behaved admirably. Still, there is a line that moves and is not up to you. “Hospital,” Nerida said, not loud, and Dot, who uses her no for fashion and her yes for reality, let us take her.

The Corolla did the work it was built to do while the three of us were less sure of our roles than we prefer. Nerida drove with a face she puts on like armour, that neutrality that allows other people’s panic to float through without sticking. I sat in the back with one hand on the back of Dot’s chair because that is a fruitless comfort that still comforts, and we all learned a new respect for the design of kerbs. The brakes behaved like men in a drill who have always known the thing they are supposed to do and have never quite been asked to do it. The carpark was a geography of hesitation and signage and we threaded it like a needle and the automatic doors admitted us the way gates to cities used to when traders arrived with bolts of cloth. Inside, the lights took the tone of a public confession and the air did its practical best to be nothing at all. Dot recovered herself while still obeying the arranged choreography—triage chair, initials, the finger clamp that tells your blood how it is doing, the cuff that makes everyone hold their breath for no reason. By the time a nurse with stern hair asked her to say her own name out loud Dot was making jokes about fainting as a hobby. “I thought I’d try it on,” she told the registrar, who failed to be stern with any meaningful success. “It’s not my colour.” The EKG made its little teeth marks on paper and declared a lack of drama that felt like grace disguised as boredom. We took Dot home in the afternoon’s particular relief, that loose hour after threat has waved from the window and gone.

On the way back I asked if I could take the car from the corner of Dot’s street to the top of ours, a distance measured, perhaps, in heartbeats. The day had turned down its volume and the road held the quiet face it wears for people who like to make arrangements. My hands on the wheel were a category of confession. The Corolla did not punish me for pasts. It forgave me none, because machines do not know forgiveness, but it offered to behave if I learned again how to ask. Nerida adjusted her seat in the passenger side and performed the delicate art of being present without filling the air with advice. The engine hummed the key of compliance. I took us forward, a movement that will never not be miraculous, and the brakes finished each sentence I began with tact. We stopped at the give way line like men who have become better at consent. We turned into our street and I let the car breathe its own air and then I put it in park and sat back with the stupid grin of a child who has managed to balance for three seconds and counts the seconds as if they are medals. Nerida put her hand briefly on the back of my neck and did not speak because sometimes you do not clap at your own small resurrections.

If heat teaches you anything it is that you are not the only animal in your house. Ants held conventions near the sink and discussed sugar as if inventing it. Moths petitioned the window for admittance and the mesh referred them politely to the management. We bought a fan secondhand that had a vocabulary of three speeds and a squeak at the fourth that it offered us without shame and we learned to tune our conversation to its cadence. In that bearing air, the steelworks let go an alarm in the small hours that had sincerity in it and the street sat up as one organism, not the primal bolt of running but the alertness that makes you stand in your doorway and take stock. A glow in the distance does not always mean danger. Sometimes it is a deliberate burn, an arrangement between men and trees, or a test of a system designed to be louder than complacency. We watched from our steps as if we were soldiers without orders. Nerida called the hospital because the hospital is a place you report to when your heart has questions and the night clerk said yes, drill, and the ward was fine, and go back to bed, but we did not, quite. We took out the manila folder I keep on the second shelf where I keep the kinds of comfort I pretend are practical—photocopies of numbers we never need, the list of batteries we did not use last time, the spot where you write “meeting place” and then realize the meeting place is your step. We updated nothing. We stood in the doorway until the alarm declared itself finished and the steelworks went back to its thoughtful moan and our street went back to its dreams and I boiled the kettle because a man stands somewhere in the noise and then, at some point, he returns to the small authority with which he can place heat under water and make it agree to stop.

The lemon bowl met its reckoning. It had been doing the quiet work of holding for so long that we had begun to assume it had been built with no intentions of leaving us. I washed it in too hot water on a morning when my hands wanted mean tasks and the glaze cracked in a line that was not a catastrophe and not a whisper. A neat spear of porcelain appeared on the bench beside it and the lemon rolled a half-turn to show me its better side as if choosing a pose for a painter. We stared at the break together and I felt the old itch to pretend it had not happened by buying a bowl with no history and calling it new. Nerida, who has begun to find beauty in permission and not just in control, said we could fix it loud. She told me about a technique that honours the fault line with gold, that says here is where it failed and here is where we decided the failure belonged. We bought a small kit from a woman in a shop that sells ambitions and tried our hands at repair. The epoxy moved like honey in winter and the powder it asked for turned it into lightning. My fingers made a mess and Nerida’s made less. We let the seam dry in its bright honesty and the bowl sat there on the bench like a survivor from a battle that no one else noticed. We put the lemon back into it with ceremony. The crack did what cracks do best; it reminded us we are not required to hide the places we learned.

On a Wednesday that had weighed itself correctly, the steelworks opened a training day for children and cowards and men like me who enjoy making stopping into a theory. There was a demonstration of the emergency mushroom button that sits at a height designed to be hit by anyone, not just operators whose names are on the sheet. The instructor had forearms that promised rescue and a voice that might have been cast in a film about small towns where good decisions are made. He said the e‑stop is a promise the system makes to people that the people make back to each other, and that you do not press it for a laugh. He invited a volunteer and a boy with a hat too big for his face pressed the red with the solemn joy of a pope and the belt ceased its motion as if it had remembered an appointment with humility. I stood there and made a list in my head of places in which we have installed e‑stops without buttons. The hollow at the base of the throat. A hand on a sleeve. The habit of pausing at the top of a hill before saying yes to the slope. Afterward we bought a hotdog because the machines had finished their sermon and the day tasted of mustard and competence.

The library invited me to stand up again, which forced me to confront the fact that while some fears loosen, others hang on like the last jacaranda blossoms on a stick of branch. This time I read a piece about a woman pressing a red button by accident and stopping a process the room had needed to stop anyway, and how sometimes the person who blunders is a saint. The librarian with the strictness in her brows shook my hand as if I had saved grammar and gave me a bottle of cordial brewed by a committee of nannas for their favourite enemies. When we walked out, the road did its quiet trick of becoming a stage. A man reversed into the one-way the wrong way and realized his error in a flash that you could see on his face, and managed to make his apology look like mischief instead of culpability. Nerida’s body half-lifted and then sat, the e‑stop pressed by two fingers you could not see, and we laughed to ourselves because there is a small joy in noticing your own restraint.

My mother sent jam sealed with wax because she does not agree with modern practices and because control of sugar is a religion she invented. The card inside had a recipe for a syllabub in a hand that leaned to the right as if on a bicycle and a postscript about a butcher’s son who had bought a ukelele for reasons nobody was judging. We took the wax off with a small knife and Nerida licked a corner of it like a child and made a face that would have charmed invaders. The jam tasted like fruit that had been told it could live forever and had agreed with reservations. We carried a jar to Dot, who pronounced it healthier than most of the men she had known and put it on her windowsill next to the saint with a chip in his cheek who guards the tea bags. Dot told us she had got her test results back and that her ticker was like a singer slightly off key who could be persuaded with the right hat, and we all agreed to call the right hat sleep.

Some days sharpen themselves without asking permission. The air at five in the morning had that insistent salt that persuades you to the ocean even if you are not the kind who throws yourself into water. We took the path to Austinmer with cups of coffee pretending to be hotter than they were and the pool did its usual trick of being both ocean and not. Old men swam in pairs with the mutual silence of people who have stood for each other in courtrooms and gardens. Nerida walked the edge and counted under her breath and the numbers were not the same as mine and I loved them. She got in with a shiver that traveled her body like a rumor and swam with the practical stroke of someone who believes forward has to be earned. On her back in the shallow end she looked like the one honest cloud and when she stood her face was new the way mud makes a new face for children. “It is easier to stop in there,” she said, wrapping her towel around a bravery like it could catch cold. “The water holds you accountable kindly.” I thought of my desk and how paper is a kind of ocean that forgives false starts.

We came home along Crown Street where the shops like to pretend to be sophisticated and the pigeons blow their cover. In the window of the frame shop was a sign hand-painted with such care it made a joke of perfection. We went in looking for nothing and came out carrying glass like a good idea. The frame we chose had space at the back for a photograph and a word and we argued lightly about what would go with what and decided to put the postcard from L face to face with the clipping the paper had made of my name. It was a quiet altar with no candles, a way of putting stay against a stay written in a different hand. We hung it in the hall where you cannot miss it even if you are not sentimental and we practiced walking past it without touching the frame, a discipline we kept until we didn’t and then decided to forgive ourselves because reverence without contact is a religion we had not subscribed to.

A week before the rotation decision was due, the hospital scheduled a vaccination clinic with the efficiency of bees and a soundtrack of children reacting bravely to small indignities. Nerida did a run of six hours as a human metronome. She jabbed with the gentleness of a person who understands the future does not require pain to be real and handed out stickers like forgiveness. When she came home, her wrists had the gentle ache of a job done without violence and her eyes had that square brightness you get when you have looked at faces that need you and refused to flinch. We sat on the step and watched the lorikeets insult the bottlebrush with their attention and told the decision aloud to the evening the way people confess to rivers. “I can do Shellharbour,” she said, not daring the future to contradict her, just placing the truth on the same plate as the lemon pips. “Three days a week. With trains where it suits and the car when light is our ally.” I drew a box on our old calendar remnant with the confidence of a child drawing a house with a chimney that will always smoke and wrote times in my careful hand. She took the pen and crossed out one of my times because that is marriage, even if no one has asked us for a ring.

On the night before it began, we made a list like a spell and then decided spells are for people who don’t trust their hands. We laid out clothes in a confidence I have seen in theatres before opening night. We placed keys in the bowl beside the philodendron and let them sit like citizens. We put petrol in the car and wiped the windscreen as if a clean view buys courage, which it does, a little. We told the kettle it would be required twice and the kettle promised in its muted way to stop when we asked it. I took the old clicker counter I keep in a drawer from the time I was a boy pretending to be important at my father’s shed and declared I would use it to count her victories even if they were invisible and she laughed because she loves me and because I am occasionally ridiculous and we have learned to spend ridiculousness where it cannot do harm.

Morning arrived in uniform. The sky did its steelworks impersonation and then improved. The run down Princes had the particular kindness of traffic that has not yet remembered its deadline. The car behaved like a creature we had fed correctly. At Windang Bridge a pelican stood on a post with the authority of a man who can read a tide’s intentions and we took that as a sign of administrative competence. The turn-off came not as a surprise but as a sentence requiring a comma and Nerida put one in the correct place. We pulled into a carpark painted with tracings for adults and found a spot that made sense to both the car and to us. She put her hand on the wheel and thanked it out loud because machines deserve to hear gratitude in the language they understand: tone and touch. In the passenger seat I clicked the counter once without looking and then thought better of the theatre and tucked it back into my pocket because keeping score is a dangerous sport in some houses. She took her lanyard with the clip that always pretends it is failing and put it around her neck with the seriousness of a uniform. “Stay,” she said to me, and meant here, within our jurisdiction, within the set of agreements we have made and will remake, within the knowledge that brakes exist and can be chosen, and I said, “I will,” and we kissed in the way you kiss when your mouths are representative and your bodies are already at work.

After she went through the hospital doors I sat in the car for a minute counting to four and then to sixteen and then to eight, a small hymn, and then I drove us home the short way because I had earned my loop. The mesh at the window hummed a note that agreed with my lungs and the kettle did exactly as it was told. On the bench the lemon bowl glittered its repair line in the sun like an old scar that wins arguments and I thought, not for the first time, that the world has given me more than my share of things that stop when asked. I put my pencil against the paper and wrote a paragraph in which the gentleman presses the red button in a factory where no one ever does because they do not wish to be shamed by machines, and in which the belt halts and the men look at one another with eyes that recognize a pause as a gift rather than a failure, and in which a woman in a hospital yard ties her lanyard and lifts her chin, and in which a lemon keeps its place in a cracked bowl, and in which two hands learn new ways to hold a wheel. The sentence was longer than it should have been and then I cut it in the middle and let the white space do some of the work. When I was done I boiled the kettle again, not because I desired tea, but because heat is a way of declaring, to the small nation of a kitchen, that you are alive and you know how to be useful.
