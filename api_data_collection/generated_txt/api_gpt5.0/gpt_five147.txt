Dawn in Newark isn’t a sunrise so much as a decision. The city turns a shoulder, shrugs off wet night air that smells like naphtha and bread, and blinks at the bruised pink skyline. The cranes at Port Newark lift their steel necks slow as herons. Somewhere in the Ironbound, ovens warm, and a hundred kitchens sing in Portuguese. A bus sighs to its stop; pigeons chit and throw themselves into a chilly gust over Penn Station. The Passaic lies there like a dark belt, cinched.

Kez woke early, but not because the light told him to. It was the other thing, the tug on the crooked nail in his breastbone, that drew him out of sleep. He lay there for a moment in the warmth of his attic room, cheek on a threadbare pillow, listening. The house on South Orange Avenue creaked and settled and breathed like anything alive. Steam hissed through the radiator. Upstairs, Mrs. Patel’s old radio murmured in Gujarati. The tug again, insistently, like a child at a coat hem: Kez. Wake.

“Alright already,” he said to nobody, and pushed the blanket back.

He was a goblin the way you only really understand when you see one without their hat on—sharp ears, slightly luminous skin the color of a wine bottle left too long at the bottom of a Newark alley, a mouth too wide for polite photographs, and pebble-teeth. He was not tall, but he had the lean, wiry solidity of a creature departments of public safety called resilient. He kept a human hat on at most times, a cap he’d convinced a thrift-store cashier was vintage rather than found on a stoop. Wore a scarf even in late April. They said it made his eyes look green. His eyes were green.

On the crooked nail in his chest—an old thing old goblins are born with and learn not to show—he hung the tiny spells that were his. A roadside candle scraped out of a church wax pool, or a flattened metro card inscribed in spidery runes, or a loop of red string from a bakery box, knots tied with his teeth. He could see them when he closed his eyes: little brown moths of magic, their wings beating, patient.

He had a reputation in the small community of goblins who clustered around this city’s drains and steam grates, its underpasses and back steps. Mostly, goblins had knacks. Glamour to look slightly more plausible to a bus driver, a knack for finding things that might not wish to be found (lost earring, the hum of an old coin at the back of a drawer), the particular art of never being the one asked to leave an establishment. Kez had those. He also had more. If a goblin elder had been inclined to give out grades, they might have written A+ in a fine rusted script and then eaten the paper. Kez didn’t think of himself as anything special. He thought of himself as someone who had to keep working hard or else he would be found by the gaps in his life.

He worked nights sometimes, which he liked, because the big machines by the water moved like tired animals and let you talk to them. He would stand with the longshoremen and flick a cigarette to glowing and lift his thumb, and the crane would gently place steel upon steel until the shipping containers hummed to one another like whales in their sleep. The men never noticed Kez at the edge of their vision, unless they were the sort who had lost a child, or spent long hours hunting stories, or were from a place where goblins were as common as cats. Then they would buy him a coffee and tell him their mother’s names. He saved the cups, washed them out, names printed in marker in a trembling hand, and lined them up on his window sill.

That morning, the tug didn’t let go.

He closed his hand around the glass of his washbasin and felt it tremble faintly. The water inside quivered; the surface split a neat skin of dust, broke, reformed. There’s a rhythm to certain warnings. One-two. Pause. Three-four. The last time he’d felt that was the winter the snow came down like it wanted to erase the sidewalks, and Aunt Verda had died with her boots on, smiling like she was listening to a joke she’d always known the punchline to.

“Who’s there?” he said, because sometimes you could get an answer. The attic fainted sunlight. The street gave him siren-sharp Doppler. The radio upstairs sighed and sputtered, resolved itself into old Hindi.

He set his hand to the window frame. He liked to touch wood to think. He liked to feel the grain. Magic is old, and old things love old things.

A voice reached him, not through the radiator or across the street, but the way a memory folds itself into a creak in the stair. It didn’t come all at once, but like wind forcing its way through a stubborn crack.

“Kez.”

The voice wasn’t Aunt Verda’s. He didn’t know it with his ears, but the nail under his skin knew it. It pulled; it tried to make him smaller.

Kez put his hand to his chest, palm flat against the cloth, as if to tell the nail to mind its own business. “Who are you?” he said, and meant it like a challenge. He was tired of half-voices. If you wanted to haunt him, get a permit and form a line.

The attic hatch rattled. The radio upstairs cut out, then came back in a flood of static, then a woman’s startled laugh. A car on the street stalled and coughed. Through the window, the morning slouched.

In the circle he’d chalked on the floor for no reason except you never knew, a dust mote drifted and hung.

“Kez,” the voice said again, pleased with itself. “Little drain-cousin. Newark’s boy. You should be dressed.”

“I’m always dressed,” he said, even though he wasn’t. He pulled on jeans and a blue shirt and the sweater with patches at the elbows; tugged the cap down over his ears; looped the scarf. “If you’re here to sell me something, leave a card. I recycle.”

A breath that wasn’t a breath, that smelled like earth turned with a spade. “I’m here to tell you we are not cousins anymore.”

The tug was wrong, then. Not like a child. Like a hook. He stood quickly, the world tilting once on its axis and then finding itself again. He reached for his bundle of tiny spells on the windowsill and tucked them into the inside pocket of his sweater, which had been a human jacket once and still remembered how to hold secrets. The cups with names looked at him, each with a ghost of steam he’d imagined too often.

“Who is this?” he said, still calm, because Aunt Verda had told him calm was louder than shouting. “And are you planning to say it to my face, or are we going to do the whisper game all morning?”

The circle on the floor winded. One chalk line smudged itself as if a fingertip had pushed through it. A shadow slid along the wall. It had length. It had a hunch to the shoulders Kez recognized—goblin. Older than him, taller, the kind of tall that comes with a close affection for ladders and scaffolds. The shadow’s hands had too many rings. The rings winked, knife smile.

“Better,” the voice said. “Look at you. You put summer on in April and call it an outfit.”

“Glamour doesn’t fit me right either,” Kez said. “You want coffee?”

“Not your kind. You haven’t listened yet. You never listened. That’s your charm.”

That was familiar, the rhythm of speech like a prayer half remembered. Kez held the edge of the window frame tighter. “You know me?”

“In a way,” the shadow said, and drew itself up taller, longer, until its head was in the slope of the ceiling, until it seemed to be wearing the house. “The way smoke knows the lungs. My name—do goblins here speak names above grates? Do they do ceremonies anymore? My name is Vox Umbrel.”

Kez said nothing for a moment. The name landed like a coin in the slot behind his sternum. He knew what the older goblins called Vox: a voice that got them into trouble, a name they said like a taste they weren’t sure they wanted to swallow. A rumor, mostly. A rumor who’d been a war-runner in cities you didn’t talk about. A rumor who told stories about the bottom of the world cracking and singing. Aunt Verda had once, actually, whispered the name into the seam of a pie crust, as if that would make the pie braver.

“Huh,” Kez said. “You’re supposed to be a story.”

“Aren’t we all,” Vox said. “Come out, little drain-cousin. Or don’t. I can talk to you through brick. I can talk to you through your soup. I can talk even if you lace your ears shut with bakery twine and say la-la and call it protection. But come. It’s always better with shoes on.”

The shadow flicked, buckled, and was gone. The chalk circle lay smudged into two perfect crescent moons.

Kez burned his tongue on the coffee he drank on the way down the stairs. He said hello to Mrs. Patel, who was folding laundry in the front room and watching a soap with the volume low. They always had the volume low here. The building had a history of listening.

“Early, Kez?” Mrs. Patel said, peering at him over the top of a towel. She’d never once called him anything but Kez, and never once seemed surprised by his ears. Her husband had been a dancer in Bombay. He’d danced with a choreographer who’d claimed to teach the gods to move. They’d seen stranger things. “You want roti? I made, and you never say yes.”

“I’m—” He bought himself a second by wrapping a scarf loop around his hand. “Maybe I’ll be back after two. Save me the ones with the bubbles?”

She waved him away. “Always these bubbles. Only you like bubbles. The others like flat.”

“Flat is for maps,” he said, and stepped into the morning.

Vox was not on the steps the way some beings would be, leaning indolently against the banister and chewing something rude. Vox was in the street, or rather in a piece of the street, stamped into the cold air. The space over the crosswalk rippled like heat above a blacktop in summer. Within the shimmer, Kez could make out an alley that didn’t exist there, and in that alley, a man who wasn’t a man at all, but a goblin dressed too carefully in human-sleek clothes, the edges expensive and surprised to be seen under these lamps. Vox’s skin was not bottle green. It was the slick of oil on a storm drain. There were rings. On every finger. Around his throat, a chain heavy enough to moor a boat. That chain had marks on it like teeth, as if something had tried, once, to eat its way free.

“Better,” Vox said, this time in air instead of under the floorboards. He had a voice that made you want to listen until you remembered your landlord was a better liar. “You do you. You persist. Chin up.”

“Where?” Kez said.

Vox’s grin opened wide enough to show the pleasure he took in being listened to. “There is going to be a sound tonight. The kind of sound that puts a hand in your hair. You—little drain-cousin, Newark’s boy—are going to miss it if you stay busy with cord and chalk. It will come over the river. It will come up from the deep for once instead of down. It will be neatly done and very frightening, and then nothing will be the same anymore.”

“Fun,” Kez said. “What do you want with me?”

“Want?” Vox sounded genuinely curious, as if it had never occurred to him that a want would bring him walking. “Wants are for small creatures. I intend to show you the newness that is coming. What you do with it is what you always do. You’ll make a paper hat out of it. You’ll tell jokes until the city claps you on the back. You’ll put it in a pocket with your strings. Do that. The show is better with you in the front row.”

“And if I don’t?”

Vox’s eyes, too many shades at once, lit in the way of a cat seeing something moving beneath a couch. “Little cousin. If you don’t, it will be harder. And what is coming is already very hard.”

Kez’s thumb found the oval of an old metro card in his pocket, the one he’d inked with his own half-forgotten alphabet. He could flick that card and make a door for himself in any surface that wanted to be a door. He could go. He could go to the roof, to Branch Brook Park, to the inside of a train as it screamed into a tunnel, for a breath. He did not do it now. He stood in the street and watched the space burn a little and smelled something sweet-and-awful like a bakery fire. He felt the tug on the nail not release him, but temper itself, the way a decent dog does when you say heel.

“Okay,” he said. “Say I care. Say I see your sound. Why me?”

“Because of who you belong to,” Vox said, as if dealing a card that had already been placed face up.

This, more than the name, more than the chain with teeth, sucked the air out of him. Goblins didn’t use belong lightly. He remembered the plank floor of Aunt Verda’s kitchen and her feet in the boots and the way she’d pointed with her whole arm toward the river, saying, This thing we are, boy. This is not one of those morning-shows where everybody cries. We belong to drains and ditches and all the places where the city rejects the city. We belong to the river when she is tired. We belong to the place behind the billboard because it forgets. We are a belonging people. We choose our edges. Remember that. Remember that when the pretty one comes and says change is a friend. Change can mean you wear someone else’s ears because they told you it would be better.

“Who do I belong to?” Kez said, smiling because his teeth were good for that.

Vox’s grin widened in a way not designed for humans. “The planet,” he said, as if he were saying bug or photograph. He showed white teeth. “And the planet is going to break.”

The buses went past them blameless. A woman with a stroller checked her phone. The sky leaned down a little, as if listening. Kez swallowed a laugh that wanted to be louder.

“Do you really wear that chain in the morning?” he asked. “Seems heavy.”

Vox touched it with one ringed finger, and the link shivered like a piano string struck with a hammer. “I put it on before I knew it would be my name. And after. I’m fond.”

“That’s a no.”

“It’s a—” Vox stopped. The amber light changed to green, and three cars leaped. “Tonight,” he said, as though a tide had intersected a note in his throat. “Down by the river’s mouth. The place with the red cranes. You know it.”

“Don’t tell me my city.”

“You think it is yours,” Vox said. “You think this is going to be like when they tried to cut and you mended the pipeline with two words and a sandwich bag. It is not. You will want help. You will recognize the shape of help when it comes. It won’t be a helpful shape.”

“And you’re the villain,” Kez said, because his mouth had to.

Vox’s eyes gleamed. “No. Not to me.”

“Okay,” Kez said again, because his job was not to understand other people’s jobs. “See you later then.”

Vox bowed, not deep but precise, the way a man might if he had old etiquette in his knees. The shimmer he wore as a doorway wrinkled itself up like cellophane and went away. He left behind him a smell of hot coins.

Kez walked to the bakery in the Ironbound and started with sugar. He bought two natas, a dozen bolos, and the girl behind the counter rolled her eyes when he asked for string. He made him laugh and she gave him the string anyway and pretended to be mean about it. He walked the morning with a pastry in his mouth and mental fingers on his spells, turning them, checking them, like a mechanic with a pocketful of bolts. He went past the church that kept its doors open even now, even though what happened to Aunt Verda was the sort of thing that closed doors. He went past three girls learning bachata on a stoop, men in aprons making the sidewalk smell like garlic heaven, a boy in a Malakai jersey sliding a Nerf ball off his knees into his hands without ever looking down. The world kept making itself with its mouth full.

He got to work early and told the cranes hello. They didn’t answer him in any way that would have been of use to someone writing it down. They moved a little easier. He went up a ladder he shouldn’t have gone up because the sign said union and Kez didn’t want to make friends by force but he needed to look. From an upper platform, the river was bigger. From an upper platform, the bend it made looked like a fist unclenching. The bay beyond was gray and calm. It was all normal. The cranes were red against that sky, rusty roman numerals.

“Tonight,” he said to the river, because talking to her was either foolish or required, and he preferred the latter.

The morning moved. He did a job that paid cash and a job that paid in old stories and a job that paid in an email that said thanks thanks thanks. He answered a text from a girl named Inez who sometimes let him touch the scar on her lip. He called out to a man he knew he should not call out to, whose name he had borrowed once and hadn’t yet returned; the man pretended he hadn’t heard. He watched a woman in sensible shoes stand at the edge of the water and take a picture. He met three goblins and one thing that might have been a goblin, and they each had opinions about Vox.

“Story,” said one, an elder named Caliso’s Daughter who wore her hair up with a comb that had belonged to four women and one man. “It’s a story because stories need teeth and he’s got many.”

“An idiot,” said a boy named Brick who was still young enough to think hard soles made you a person. “An idiot with a necklace.”

“Dangerous,” said a quiet one whose name Kez had never gotten to stick in his mind, because the man refused to throw it. “He eats the icing and throws the cake away.”

Kez kept his mouth shut about the nail behind his ribs. He doesn’t tell them about the voice. He doesn’t tell them about Aunt Verda’s warning every time he wanted to think of himself as singular: You are the fifth mouse in a trap with four holes. If you get out, don’t brag about it. They know who you are. They made it so.

At lunch, he sat with his feet dangling over a concrete lip and bit into a sandwich like it had done something to him. Across from him sat a bus driver on break, wearing gray with a badge that said Luz. She didn’t look at him for a long time. When she did, it was to ask, “Is it going to be a thing?”

Kez swallowed, startled. “What?”

She shrugged in the international sign for that thing. “The river’s been snoring all week. My route goes over the bridge and it’s like the steering wheel hums. I hear things sometimes. Look, you can tell me no. I didn’t look at your ears. I didn’t say what I said.”

“It’ll be a thing,” he said, surprised to hear himself be honest. “Yeah.”

She nodded and bit her apple so hard the sound made a small conversation with the water. “You need a ride later?”

Kez laughed, uneasy. “No,” he said. “I think the river’s giving rides tonight.”

“You take care, frog,” she said, using the Ironbound’s word for a goblin when they liked you. “Bring me back a story that doesn’t end dumb.”

Evening fell fast. The river turned itself deeper. The sky did that trick where it isn’t actually darker yet but every color has pulled a blanket up. Lights in apartment windows tried on their faces. A truck driver honked a little tune and laughed at his own joke. The cranes stood like red jurors.

Kez pulled the metro card, the string, the candle stub, the coin. He tucked a small radio into his pocket because certain frequencies have teeth too. He didn’t call anybody. His phone charged on the sill next to the cups with names. He told Aunt Verda’s boots goodbye. He told the house to lock itself. He told the city what he would do if the rails shivered.

He went to the river. He stood on concrete that had been repaired until it could have written a memoir about being broken and mended, broken and mended, which is another way of staying. Other people stood there too. Not just goblins. Humans with eyes like they had been hearing the hum too. A woman with the look of a nurse, shoulders squared, hands that knew how to lift. A man in a hard hat who kept touching the hat’s brim like it could tell him the time. Two teenagers with mouths open a little, sneakers scribbled with band names and prayers. Luz, the bus driver, because of course she said she wouldn’t but she did. Caliso’s Daughter stood very straight. Brick made faces behind her back and then stopped because the moment didn’t have patience for him.

Vox didn’t appear like a stage magician. He appeared like a fact. Suddenly he was standing on a piece of shadow that seemed to think it was a step, the chain coiled across his chest, the rings at his fingertips reflecting the city back at itself in mean little circles.

“Welcome,” he said, in case anyone had expected welcome. “The show begins.”

Kez stood with his hands in his pockets and felt how knit the city was, from the wire in a lamp post to a pram left with a blanket folded in it to the knot in the back of his neck. He had a habit of counting living things around him when he was scared. Five gulls. A rat who thought of herself as a grandmother, if rats think in those words. The nurse. Luz. Caliso’s Daughter and Brick and the quiet one whose name would not stick. Two kids. A man with his hard hat discarded so he could hold his wife’s hand with both hands. Dozens more, not all in his sight.

Vox lifted his hand. The rings shone. He wasn’t doing tricks. The air did the thing air does before something heavy moves. The bay beyond this bend of the river changed from gray to something that implied depth in a way paint never could. Kez felt it in the nail and in the bones in his toes. The water inhaled. The cranes at the mouth of the port turned their heads.

Then the sound came.

It came up like a note held beneath other notes. It was not a foghorn or a siren or the cry of a gull. It was a single tone, pure as if made by an instrument too simple to lie, drawn up out of the deep and held in the throat of a mouth the size of a city block. It reached into Kez’s ears and put its hand on his hair and smoothed him back, and he did not think of Aunt Verda or the bakery or his cups with names. He thought of a river before any of this, before there were cranes and rails, the river and the moon wiping each other’s faces with the sleeve of a night so clean it tasted like metal.

People shouted. Not many at first. Then more. Not because the sound was loud, but because it was true. That’s not always comfortable.

“What is that?” someone yelled. “Is that a ship? Is that—”

Kez put his hand to his chest and felt the nail burn cold. He used his other hand to find the metro card. He wanted a door. He wanted it quickly. He could punch a door into the air if he had to; he’d done it when a man had fallen from a scaffolding once, had made his fall smaller, taught the air how to catch him. Now he didn’t punch. He flicked. He drew a rectangle in the air like a child drawing a house. It answered him. The air thin-skinned, stretched, became a surface.

“You steal that trick?” Vox said conversationally, watching. “Or did you pull it out of somebody who didn’t want to give?”

Kez didn’t answer. He opened the door a little, and through it he saw a path he’d prepared long ago, a loop of string knotted around a beam under a pier, the beam stained with old gum and a heart cut there by someone who had been sixteen and dangerous. He used to sit under there in summers and listen to the drips. He could get there now in a step. He could, if he had to.

The sound swelled. On the far water, a shape rose. It was not a whale, though people who were aired on television later would say, It was a whale, it was like a whale. No. It was not something with eyes. It was the edge of something. A rim. Imagine a coin as big as the state, falling slowly through water, the edge slicing up through the surface before the face. The water failed on either side of it, failed to be water for a moment. Bird bodies flurried in confusion. The cranes leaned closer. The rim rose, and rose, and then hit the air with a clank you didn’t hear with your ears, turned, and presented a face. It was marked. It was dark. It was the plate of the world.

Kez knew it as soon as he saw it: the skin of the planet. Not the whole. A piece. A scale. He had never been taught such words. He did not need to be. The nail behind his ribs said yes with such authority he nearly laughed.

People fell to their knees to be dramatic and because it was easier not to stand. Vox watched them with the indulgence of a man in shoes that do not pinch. He lifted his hand again. He did not pull the scale of the world out of the river like a magician doing scarves. He had shown it and let it show itself. Kez understood that in real time and hated that he admired it.

“What are you doing?” Kez said.

“Showing you the hinge,” Vox said. “There are hinges in everything. That is how you make leverage. That is how you unmake what is badly made.”

“By—” Kez gestured at the rising edge: by lifting a piece of the skin of the world out of the river like it had no business there. He could not make the sentence.

“By making a noise the planet has to answer,” Vox said. “She’s old. She has arthritis. I spoke to it, arthritis. She answered. I’m not cruel. I am efficient.”

“Efficient,” Kez repeated. The word tasted like cheap metal.

From somewhere behind him, a woman cried, “What does he want?”

Vox heard and smiled at someone who wasn’t there. “To bring down the planet,” he said, not loudly, but in a tone that put every letter on its foot. He rolled his wrist, and the rings flashed. “But you must understand, that’s a sentence that flatters itself. The planet doesn’t fall. She yields. She changes her tilt and the rest of you have to figure out coats.”

“You can’t—” Kez didn’t finish. He had lived through hurricanes. He had lived under bridges in August when heat made its own rules. He had slept on a radiator because reality had gotten too big. He knew what it was to be the size of a dinner plate in a city that thought of itself as the whole meal. He also knew how many people in the city would drown if the hinge Vox offered were properly moved.

“You can’t,” he said again anyway.

Vox looked at him with something like patience, or like hunger. “You will try to stop me,” he said, and the calm with which he said it made Kez hate his hands for sweating. “That is part of the music. Without you, it would be discordant. With you, we might get harmony. It’s a gift, little drain-cousin. This belonging. Imagine all those bus drivers. Nurses. Construction men in sensible shoes. People who write their names on cups. Imagine all of them hearing the note and showing up with their small and stubborn hearts and thinking of themselves as large. They will think their standing here matters. It will. But not the way they think. The way it will matter is that you will see them. And when you see them, you will be more yourself. You will be, as they say, magic.”

Kez looked at Luz. She had taken off her jacket and put it on a kid who looked colder than they cared to admit. The nurse had her hands on a woman’s back, wordless. The hard hat man had set his hat back on his head and adjusted it with his middle finger because he had never known it any other way. Brick made eye contact with Kez and rolled his eyes like this was stupid and he was bored and then did not look away. Caliso’s Daughter met Vox’s gaze with a cold steady thread of a look that could cut rope.

“Family meeting then,” Kez said, and was not surprised to hear his voice not shake. “Fine.”

He closed the door he had made and put his hand on the river’s skin the way you put your hand on a horse to let it see you. He felt how tired she was. He felt how she wanted to lie down and have somebody else keep time. He felt how she loved the train tracks that ran along her like a necklace, how she loved her own bridges like fierce daughters who left home but called. He felt the scale of the world heaving up, and the horrible safety of giving in.

“Stop,” he said to Vox. He knew it was a joke when he said it. Better to say it with gusto.

Vox bowed again. He was polite. This was a thing he had. “No,” he said.

“Then dance,” Kez said, and the old card in his pocket hummed.

He reached into the pocket with his right hand and out again with the candle stub. He didn’t light it. He didn’t need to. He spoke three words Aunt Verda had packed in her boots and left for him for breakfast. They were not in any language that had ever been carved into stone. They were the sound you make when you first see the ocean. They were the sound you make when you slice open your finger and remember you are not a jar. He pressed those words to the candle and the candle remembered every blown-out wish in the whole Blessed Sacrament and it burned with that energy, wish for wish, kitchen smoke, prayer again and again and again.

He threw the candle at the world’s scale. He knew it would go through the air like something else. He knew it would attach itself not to the edge but to the seam where edge met water. He knew because magic is an old dog; it only changes its tricks when you lie to it kindly.

The water shuddered. The sound changed timbre. Vox’s gaze sharpened in a way a man’s gaze sharpens when he discovers someone else has been in the room the whole time, rearranging chairs.

“You are not small,” he said to Kez. It was not a compliment. It was an adjustment in tactic.

Kez’s hands were shaking now. He could do three, maybe four of those. He had done one. He had three strings in his pocket, knots different, knotted in different moods, knotted on different days—the day of Aunt Verda, the day the boy on the scaffolding fell, the day he’d been so tired he’d made a door and gone to a place with no language just to breathe for an hour. He took out the second string, knotted blind, knotted with his teeth, and looped it like a lasso, like he had seen cowboys do at a carnival. He had not been good at the carnival. He was good now.

He threw. The loop described a perfect circle in the air and settled on the head of a bolt the size of a truck on the underside of the scale, the bolt made by nobody you could indict. He pulled. The loop tightened. Everybody who stood by the river without knowing why felt a tug behind their ribs, because in the end we all belong to our own hinges. They pulled. They didn’t know they were pulling, but they did. Luz’s hands tightened. The nurse’s back strengthened. Brick’s jaw set. Two kids who’d come to film on their phones lowered their arms and then raised them again, because the moment asked for witnesses.

The scale of the world grudgingly did what things do when they realize the story is bigger than one person’s pronouncements. It hesitated. That was enough. That was all magic ever needs. A human will can push a building if it first convinces the building to lean.

Vox hissed anger through a smile. “All at once then,” he said, like someone tasting something too sweet and deciding to pour the bowl over his head anyway.

He spread his arms. The rings flashed. The chain across his chest sang a deep, mean song. Under the water, something old and interior to water moved. Kez felt it like a future headache. He reached for the third string. His fingers fumbled. The knot didn’t want to be undone. It wanted to do something worse than the right thing. That was a particular character of the string he’d tied on the day Aunt Verda died. He had tied it mean. He had to kiss the knot. He had to tell it that it was loved. He did, which was not a thing he was proud of, and the knot relaxed, and he did the little loop again, and the hard hat man’s hand found the hand of his wife, and the nurse said something into the back of the woman’s neck, and Luz whistled like you whistle when you want to be noticed by a blackbird and you are not even trying to be a poet, you are just talking in a language that could care less about grammar.

Kez threw the string and this one did not do as asked. This one shot itself like a river of bright up the edge toward the face of the scale, the wrong place, the unhelpful place where reasons go to die. He cursed once, and it sounded like he had any right to. He moved his hand, and the string stilled, and then, folding itself like a line in a poem that had realized its rhyme, it curled back to the seam where Kez had asked it to go in the first place. It looped. It tightened.

And then something else happened. If he were to tell it true later, if he were to write it down, he would say that is when voices came. They came not in unison, not like a choir, but like a stadium that doesn’t know what it wants and then knows, suddenly, that it wants the same thing. They came across the city like a wind. They came from the people who had not walked to the river, who had stayed where they were, caring for children asleep or old men who had to be turned every two hours or a dog that could not be left alone without weeping; they came from the cabdrivers who recognized the weird quiet between the honks and went still to hear; they came from a woman in her bathtub with a glass of wine who was young and mean and in love and did not know a goblin from a newsstand but who hummed to herself without noticing it. They hummed back. They hummed.

Luz stared into the middle distance, eyes widened. “Do you hear that?” she said to nobody, and to all of them.

“Yeah,” Kez said.

It wasn’t that millions had chosen, in that second, to show up. It was that millions had never left. They had been here the whole time. If you stood at any corner and said, Who is this city, the city would point at them with both hands. They hummed under their breath, and their hum became a tone a little above the planet’s note, and if you are a musician you know what happens when two tones are near. They made a third. It wasn’t pretty. It was a beat. It was resistance. Kez felt it under his nail. He felt it in his ears. Vox felt it too; his eyes cut sharp, his hands set, the chain across his chest rose and fell like a serpent that wasn’t sure if it had been called or insulted.

“Ah,” Vox said softly, as if remembering something he had wanted desperately to forget. “Of course.”

“Of course,” Kez said, because he could be obnoxious when frightened, and because this was the part Aunt Verda had taught him even when he’d refused to listen. Magic would do this: it would ask the people to show up. It would tell the goblin to stop pretending he had to stand alone. It would make a hum. It would put the hum under your feet and say Now go.

Kez went.

He stepped into the door he had drawn and came out on the beam under the pier and spoke the words again, not the ones about not being a jar, but the ones that taste like vinegar and smoke, the ones that invite iron to be silk for a second, which is a rudely generous ask. He pressed. He had both of his hands on the seam now. He knew what it was to get a booger rocket out of a child’s nose. It was like that, only the child was the bottom of the world. He said please.

He could feel Vox above him like a weather system. He could feel the focus of him, the hot attention. He could feel the plant of his feet on the shadow step, and the way Vox thought of himself as a person who does not run out of tricks before the end of the day, and the way that thought gives certain men a look that is very charming until you find yourself under it and realize it is a lid.

“Give,” Kez said to the seam, to the hinge, to the place where you shouldn’t ask because it’s impolite. “Just a smidge.”

The seam … listened. That’s the verb he would fight with later. It made sense to him then and he would not let it be argued away. The seam listened. It had wanted to be heard for so long it had become better at being heard than at being whole. It listened, and a small piece of the wrong came unlatched. The great scale, the plate of the world, slid back down a breath. The water leaped to close over it like a child finally allowed to sleep. The note changed, and people up and down the city lifted their heads because in their houses something had lost its balance and found a new one.

Vox swore. The chain around his throat shattered a single link with a sound like a bell being cut wrong. He put his hand to the break, and that small gesture, that purely practical and unplanned move, that catch of the breath in a man who had thought the whole operation was metaphysical and above the need for fingers—that was the thing that made Kez understand something he would have guessed if he had been better at guessing certain kinds of men. Vox felt everything. He was not a rumor. He was not above, in the way myths say above and mean uninterested. He loved the hinge. He loved the crack. He loved the way a thing felt when it went from intact to not. He loved it like a craftsman loves the turn of a tool. He wanted to bring down the planet because he wanted to know what it felt like. It was love, the rotten kind.

“You’re disgusting,” Kez said, and smiled because he could, and because Aunt Verda had told him, If you are going to insult a person, do it in a way that implies you could still live in the same house if you had to.

“You are sentimental,” Vox said, and made the word into a category and pretended the category was an insult.

“Sentiment is a sort of stubborn,” Kez said. “And look, I’m all out of strings.”

He wasn’t. He had a fourth. He didn’t want to use it because he had tied the fourth on a night he had been most afraid of becoming someone else’s story. He had sat on the steps outside and listened to a train scream through a high rail and imagined his bones as the train. He had tied a knot in the string so hard he had thought his teeth would crack. He took it out now. He didn’t untie it. He kissed it and he said, I know what you were for, and I love you anyway, and I need you for something else. He breathed on it, river air and pastry sugar. He had an ache in his back that would write him letters for three days. He looped the knot and hurled it at the seam, and it bit.

The seam let out a long, miserable sigh and then a relieved one, the way a person does when their back is cracked by someone with good hands. The scale of the world slid down into the water, slowly, reluctantly, gorgeous. The river fell in love with herself again. The cranes straightened. The gulls laughed. The buses across the bridges found their wheels align.

The humming of the city made a different chord. It wasn’t triumph. It was something steadier.

Vox drew his mouth into a line. He didn’t vanish. He didn’t clap and monologue. He stepped down off his shadow step in the ordinary way, which is sometimes the most shocking way a person can leave a stage. He came to the river’s edge and stood there like a man who has done a thing he will not apologize for but who is willing to say it did not go perfectly. He looked at Kez, and when Kez looked back, it was like looking down a hallway with doors. Behind one of those doors, Kez thought, there is a boy who wanted a name so badly he took one from a chain. Behind another, there is a man who thinks love is the moment of the break. And behind the third, there is a voice that can talk a planet into bending because it speaks exactly in her old ache. You cannot fight that with tricks. You fight it with belonging. You fight it with neighbors.

“Tonight, then,” Vox said quietly, to Kez and to the water and to the city that was still humming. “Tonight you found a way to be a hinge. It will not always be like that. Let them come. Let them find you. We’ll see what millions feel like, little cousin. We’ll see if you drown in their attention or drink it.”

Kez climbed up from the beam. He smelled like river shins, like pennies and mud. He met Luz’s eye, and she lifted her chin and said, “Okay, frog.”

“Okay,” he said.

The nurse wiped her hands on her jeans and grinned. “We’re not dead.”

“Not yet,” the hard hat man said with a minimum of gloom. “That was something.”

Caliso’s Daughter didn’t say anything. She stood with the comb in her hair and the old knowledge in her stance and looked at Kez like she had seen him on a day he would not admit to yet. Brick scuffed the toe of his shoe in a circle and said, “That was dumb. Can we do it again?”

Kez shook water off his fingers and the drops lit briefly where they landed like the light behind a stained glass window. It was a trick. He didn’t know if he had done it or just liked to see it. He was tired and hungry and he wanted to go home and tell Aunt Verda’s boots that he had not messed up the whole planet tonight. He wanted to call Inez and brag badly. He wanted to drink something sweet on the stoop and listen to teenagers singing when they didn’t think anyone was. He wanted to be boring for a week.

Vox turned and walked, and the crowd let him go, because you don’t pull on your enemy’s sleeve when you’re not sure what kind of dog he owns. He crossed the bridge without looking back, because men like him have made a habit of moving and are good at it. Kez watched him and liked him fine, in the way you like a fire when you know where your bucket is.

A siren finally remembered itself. The first official car arrived with someone official inside. Somebody’s aunt was on the phone with somebody’s bishop; somebody else upended a thermos and poured out thick spiked sweet coffee and passed it around and did not take anything for it but yes. The trains kept going. The city returned its shoulder to where it had been, but not quite. Kez could feel the tilt in the way a pin feels the famous straw. It was fine. He could work with fine.

He walked home slow with Luz, who said nothing and then, at his door, said, “You need a ride, you call. I’m not a light. I’m a bus. Call me anyway.”

He said goodnight to the cups with names and to the string tied on the inside of his jacket. He sat on the floor and realized his legs had decided to be other people for a while. He laid his cheek on the boards where Aunt Verda had stomped flour into the cracks. He listened for the voice under the stair.

He didn’t hear Vox. He heard the hum of a city, but the hum wasn’t in his ears; it was in the nail. He reached for his phone and, without thinking about it, took a picture of the cups by the window. He posted it with a caption that suggested nothing and said everything: we are the handles.

The thing got shared. He did not do that. He went to sleep in his clothes and dreamed of cranes bowing and water that tasted like fresh battery tongue. Somewhere under him, under the floor, the house stretched. Up in the Ironbound, a woman reading through a headache felt the hum in her temple ease. Downtown, a boy walking alone looked up because he felt a hand on his neck and smiled because when he turned there was nobody there. On a bridge, Vox paused for a cigarette and stared at the river and said, “Hinge,” as if practicing a language not his.

In the morning, Kez would wake up to a phone that would not stop moving in his hand. He would wake to cards at his door, the cheap kind printed yesterday: If you need a place to sit, call me. If you need a rope, we have rope. If you need someone to knock on a door with you, we like knocking. He would wake up to voices that had followed him home in their effortless numbers. He would wake up to a city that had made a decision to believe its own hum was important. He would wake up to the eye of a planet that had twitched and then turned back over, muttering.

It would not be the end. It would not be the beginning. It would be both in the particular way days are both if you are paying attention. He would drink coffee so badly he would make Luz laugh. He would go to the Ironbound and stand outside the bakery until the girl gave him a bag and said, “You eat like a child,” and he would say, “I am a child,” and she would say, “No.”

He would walk to the river again, because what else. He would feel the tug on the nail, which would now be a steady hand more than a hook. He would discover what it meant to have millions of people you had never met show up in a way that was gentle and had teeth. He would realize that he had not been good at magic; he had been good at listening. He would be surprised to find out those were the same thing.

He did not know yet that Vox would show up on a stoop across from him wearing a hat that did not suit him and reading a newspaper he had no business reading. He did not know yet that the chain around Vox’s neck would be one link shorter and that there would be a mark there like a bite. He did not know yet that the planet does not forget the hum of those who belong to her, and that she would hum along when they needed it. He did not know much.

But for now, he knew this: he was Newark’s boy. He belonged to drains and ditches and the place behind the billboard because it forgets. He did not belong to Vox. He did not belong to the sound that wanted to put its hand in his hair and make him a dog. He belonged to the cups with names on his sill. He belonged to Luz. He belonged to the cranes. He belonged to the thing inside him that would always try to mend.

And he slept, and even while he slept the city kept its heat in and its heat out and its hum up and its hum down. He slept like a hinge does when it has done an honest day’s work. He slept a little with one ear. He dreamed the planet said, Not yet. He said back: Okay. Just tell me. Tell me when.Chapter 4

Kez woke to a phone trying to crawl out of his pocket like a beetle and to the feeling that the house had spent the night learning his name all over again. The hum in the crooked nail was different, not the hook that had pulled him out of sleep yesterday, nor the soft press of a dog’s nose from years when he had been lonely and made pets out of vibrations. It was a steady palm on his chest, a municipal hand, callused and practical. He lay still long enough to decide he could stand up without discovering his legs had quit the job. Then he did, and the phone pattered against his thigh, and the radiator sighed as if relieved it didn’t have to be the only hot thing in the room.

He did not look at the phone yet. He had to greet the cups first, superstition or respect, he never minded which. The names in black marker looked back at him with that faint halo of grease you could scrub and scrub and still see, the way certain griefs polished you. The post he’d made, the offhand caption—We are the handles—had gone somewhere his jokes usually did not go, and the comment count made the screen look like it had borrowed a storm. He ignored it despite himself and looked out the attic window. South Orange Avenue already had its shoulders up, early traffic shouldering past with an eagerness that implied relief from bad dreams. Somewhere downstairs, Mrs. Patel sang over the radio because sometimes the language of the songs and the language of her mouth met and sometimes they were delightedly different.

When he finally thumbed the messages, his hand got a little numb. The first three were pictures from Luz: a blurry shot of a bridge, the windshield misted with a night that had finally decided to be average; a photo of a thermos with chipped enamel that said Raza on it in blue letters; a square of a hand-drawn sign taped to the inside of her bus that read in heavy black marker, If you need to get there, I can at least get you close. The next dozens were the particular genre of help Newark had invented and perfected and exported, an art installation of favors. If you need bread, someone wrote with a phone number and a street he had walked, my cousin delivers from the back of the bakery and he doesn’t charge extra because he thinks he is Robin Hood. If your front door sticks, another said, I have the tools. If you are small and not feeling large, wrote a nurse with a profile picture that included a twelve-year-old and a grin like a watermelon wedge, I am good at reminding people how lungs work, metaphoric and otherwise. There were cousin-it’s-been-so-long texts from goblins who had drifted to Montclair or fell into New York and pretended they were very busy until something shook a hinge and they remembered the bottom of the world and called home. There were warnings, because Newark performs care by being rude when required. Do not meet anyone alone, wrote Caliso’s Daughter, and if you must, tell them you have three names to spend and you will not waste one on them. There were heart emojis from people who felt embarrassed about that and then sent six more to cover it.

He read them until the phone got warm and his thumb cramped, and then he put the thing on the sill with the cups and told it to cool its jets. The air in the attic had the taste of boiled wood he associated with winter even though April had said she would try her best to pretend otherwise. He did not change clothes; he was still wearing what he had worn to argue with a plate of the planet. He did, at least, brush his teeth, and as he spit he told the tap thanks for doing the steady work while the spectacular made speeches.

The envelope at the door had been slid under in the night with a politeness that tripped a wire. He crouched to pick it up and felt his knees talk about him; they had had more to say lately. The paper was heavy, the legal kind that implies you are trusted with procedure. Inside there was a laminated badge with his name spelled almost right—Kezi—beneath the small seal of a city department so old the ink itself seemed to smoke. The badge had a strip of magnetic tape and an expiration date three days from now. Attached by a paperclip was a card with a number and four words in mechanical printing that had been circled twice: Emergency Operations Center, Access.

He stood in the hall with his scarf looped once around his throat and the badge in his palm and tried to listen to how the crooked nail felt about it. The nail had never been the sort to yank him toward fluorescent lighting and municipal chairs. The nail had liked drains, and the thwap-note of a bus card on a reader, and the sound of someone at two a.m. in a laundromat because the machines sing. He turned the badge over twice. On the back, someone had written a name by hand between the printed text: Lila Tavares, and beneath that, civil. He appreciated that ‘civil’ might be a title and not a temperament and admired a person who wrote their own half-joke on an official object. He tucked the badge into his inside pocket with the strings and it hummed very softly to itself, like a well-behaved wasp.

In the kitchen, Mrs. Patel offered him roti again in the way of a woman who had decided the argument had already been won. He took two and the argument evaporated. She placed them into his hand hot, and in that heat he could feel the exact conversation she had had with herself about how to get a puff right this time, and how to time the oil, and how to watch the surface while letting the mind go someplace with a younger man and an older song. She said, “You are in the paper, Kez,” and he made a noise like that meant nothing, and she nodded once because that was the correct noise and also the wrong one. “Some of them tell lies,” she added, unrolling another circle, “and some tell the truth without meaning to, which is worse. Today you take a sweater and not your cap or else people will see only a goblin and not my friend.”

“I can do both,” he said, laughing because she was busy making sense and also because he could do neither thing completely.

“You cannot,” she said without looking up. “Take the sweater.”

He took the sweater. He didn’t argue about the cap. He put the badge on a string around his neck and tucked it under his shirt and felt like a person who had been told to behave at a wedding.

The bakery in the Ironbound was already full of bodies performing precise choreography with elbows and chairs. He slipped through, saluted the girl who pretended to charge him twice for string because he’d made a crack about her haircut last month and she was keeping accounts, and ordered the same two natas he thought of as his because decisions keep you from falling through the floor. As he waited, Inez slid in beside him with her coat half off and her hair up like it had promised better and gotten normal. The scar at her lip shone in the kind of light that makes anyone interesting. She did not say hello at first because the line was talking in Portuguese and hello felt common.

“You are ridiculous,” she said when she could, and that meant she had watched at least some of the footage, the lousy midnight phone stuff with the lens flare that made lights into fairy rings, the local camera from a guy who had once shot a quinceañera that went bad and had a talent for making bad things look less bad than they were and good things look complicated enough to deserve scratching your chin.

“My mother told me that,” he said, and she snorted because he never talked about his mother and here he was making a joke that implied one. She touched the badge’s outline under his sweater with the tips of two fingers and the tips burned a little because everything about Inez burned when she felt like it. “They’re going to make you into something stupid,” she said, glancing down like she was interested in the case for croissants. “They’re going to give you a key to the city and also a ticket for standing on a pier without permission.”

“I intend to earn both at the same time,” he said, and the pastries arrived and steaming made the air sweet, and they went outside because the line behind them was getting the particular rustle that suggests a fight and they did not want to be in the way when the words started throwing elbows.

Outside, the sky was that curdled spring gray that sometimes produces light like the inside of an oyster and sometimes gives you a headache you name after your least favorite aunt. The little triangle park at the corner had two chessboards inlaid into the tables and three men pretending they didn’t like losing. Inez bit into a nata and icing found the soft place above the scar and she let it sit there because cruelty can be flirtation but tenderness dresses better. She jerked her chin at the river the way they had learned to indicate a noun with a tilt rather than a word. “You going back,” she said, and made it almost a question.

“Help has a shape you won’t like,” he said, and the way he said it made both of them look at the badge, and she blew out a breath that made a hair on her cheek do a small dance.

“Police,” she said, and he shook his head. “Worse,” he said, and her mouth did a little twist; she had been in rooms where fluorescent lights hummed like they thought they were important and men in unflattering shirts explained disasters to her with the affection of people who love disasters a little.

“They want to see your tricks,” she said, because she had known him on nights when he had failed to do small magic to find a lost earring because he had been thinking about his aunt and had eaten half a loaf of bread instead.

“They want me to make chairs into bridges,” he said. “I want to make chairs into chairs. I want to sit the city down and ask her if her hips are all right.”

“You’re going to go anyway,” Inez said, and flicked sugar at a pigeon and the pigeon ducked as if they had a deal. “Because you are sentimental and you think sentiment is an engineering solution.”

“I am going to go,” he said. “And I’m going to bring a bus driver and a nurse so they can yell if someone starts drawing a map on my back.”

“You always bring someone,” she said, and he liked the admiration in there because it was small and honest and the opposite of what the internet had invented for him last night.

On the corner by Penn Station, a man in a hat that did not suit him pretended to read a paper with a large photograph he definitely did not enjoy above the fold. Kez saw Vox before he allowed the seeing to land in his throat, and then he let it be there and stay. Vox had chosen human caution in his attire and human vanity in his shoes, which were too expensive and too clean and made him look like the way a bridge looks the day before it’s opened, polished and already gathering its future grit. The chain at his throat sat shifted because it lacked now a link, and where the break had been mended there was a mark like an old hunger’s tooth. He watched Kez and Inez stand there with their pastries and their opinions and he grinned like the idea of food could do nothing but entertain him.

“Don’t,” Inez said from the side of her mouth, as if telling a toddler not to pick up a hot pan. “Let him get in line for once.”

“He is incapable,” Kez said, and then Vox folded his paper as if he’d caught the cue from a stage manager.

“I liked the caption,” Vox said, and he did not raise his voice because true stage voices are never louder than they need to be. “We are the handles. Do you know what a handle is to a person like me? It is leverage, little cousin. It is the point at which you spend less energy than you should to move what is not yours.”

“You’d be surprised what belongs to me,” Kez said, deliberately wiping his finger on a napkin and making Inez laugh because it was the exact wrong thing to say to an entity that had named himself after noise and shadow.

“I am rarely surprised,” Vox said, and tilted his head in the direction of the river, as if casually indicating where he would like the next conversation to be if Kez had any taste. “But I am not incapable of awe, and last night was almost awe, for a moment, until you took the good part away.”

“The good part,” Inez said, and he saw her hand flex and had to respect that her instinct was not to tuck herself out of danger but to examine its teeth.

“The break,” Vox said, and tasted the word like it was the first fruit of summer. “You mistake me if you think I am cruelty wearing rings. I am fascination with a purpose. I am the man who opens a hinge because he wants to see the pin. I am not ashamed, and therefore I am very difficult to convince.”

“You’re talking in a corner like you wouldn’t be ugly on a stage,” Inez said, and the words surprised her a little because they came out with the rhythm of a person who has been watching carefully and is now not as shy as she thought. “Are you stealing audience now, or are you afraid of lights.”

“I am afraid of nothing,” Vox said, and the chain at his throat did a subtle thing none of them could have seen if they had not known bones: it lifted on one side and dropped on the other as if nodding yes where the mouth had declined.

Kez did the polite thing; he looked down at the paper so Vox could feel as though he had forced someone to read. The headline had the panicked kindness of decent local reporting, trying to say nothing and everything in one breath: Disturbance at the Port Stirs Residents; City Officials Cite Unusual Phenomenon. The photo showed cranes bent like they were bowing to an emcee. He had to shut his grin down by force because he had been taught that certain laughs get you chased.

“You let the city sing,” Kez said, lifting his eyes again. “She will not forget that you asked her to.”

“I would never want her to forget,” Vox said, and this perhaps was the truest thing he had said in all the moments they’d had. “I am moving my hinge inland tonight. Water is very theatrical. She loves an audience and always has. She cooperates. I want to see if the same tone makes power lines pray. I want to hear your trains beg their rails.”

“Power,” Inez said under her breath, and she made a face at the word like it tasted of pennies left under a tongue.

“The Emergency Operations Center gave you their little passing-privilege,” Vox said, and the small lift of his chin toward the hidden badge made Kez itch. “Go. Sit with them. Count their chairs. Learn their fluorescent forms. You will need those shapes if you want to keep your city in one piece. And then, when you have learned where they keep the map with the old fault lines drawn by hand with somebody’s pencil because the now-map is not big enough for memory, come watch me try another sound.”

“You’re telling me where to be,” Kez said, and he used mockery because every other flavor at his disposal would have made the back of his neck cold.

“I intend to be generous,” Vox said. “Do not confuse generosity with friendship. I prefer an audience that knows it has paid to get in.”

Inez finished her pastry with a small flick of her chin like a knife and bundled the napkin meaningfully into a ball she could have thrown hard if she had to. “He’s trying to make this into a love story,” she said to Kez, loud enough that the men at the chess tables looked up and smiled even though they didn’t know who they loved best today.

“Every good war is one,” Vox said, and then he went like a person who had paid his bill and had a meeting, folding back into the stream so neatly one could forgive him for believing he was made for it. The missing link in his chain winked like an eye.

The badge worked. It admitted Kez through a glass door that thought very highly of itself and into the sudden weather of air-conditioning and coffee that had been sitting with an open lid. The Emergency Operations Center was both exactly what he had imagined and more heartbreaking. He had pictured maps and junction points and a large screen on which cable news sometimes tried to seduce someone into thinking it was necessary. All that was here. Also here were the bits that suggested these people loved the city like a bad dog they would never give up: scotch tape holding up a picture drawn by a child who had once visited and decided the stoplight was a friend; a paper cup with five names in inconsistent handwriting; a baseball cap hung on a hook with sincerity at the angle. Caliso’s Daughter would have said, This room remembers, and she would have meant it as both blessing and diagnosis.

Lila Tavares met him at the threshold of a conference room that looked as if it would cry if left alone for too long. She was the age where hair goes silver at the temples just enough to make you look like you are cosplaying wisdom; her hands were idly wrapped in a measuring tape the way some people wrap their hands in rosaries for comfort. She was civil in the way foreheads can be civil, the rest of her face not willing to devote itself to the performance. She nodded once at his hat and once at his ears and once at his mouth because she did not intend to be surprised and then said, “I have been told you are good at listening.”

“It’s my one marketable skill,” he said, and she smiled with one edge of the mouth because she had performed that duo of joke and true thing in other rooms with people who had different ears and worse intentions.

“Sit here,” she said, and took the head of the table, not because she wanted to be the head but because heads are where people look by instinct when they panic and she did not want to make an intern accidentally the one who has to shake. Around the table sat six people who could each, if asked to, stop a city block from collapsing into itself out of sheer unwillingness to watch it go. A tall man with a chin like a bridge support; a tired woman in EMS green with hair braided down her back like a rope; a short guy with cheeks that remembered youth sports and a laptop he was trying to pretend did not exhaust him; a grandmother in a cardigan who was not related to anyone and also somehow related to everyone because she had been showing up in rooms like this since the city almost forgot itself in other decades.

“We’re not pretending we understand last night,” Lila said without preamble, and her voice had gravel and also a little water because she had gone to stand by the river and had sworn quietly at it for doing the thing it had done without telling her first. “We do not have the luxury of pretending; we have to act. We have to act like pragmatic people who have sixty seconds for a thing that will take two hours. So I will ask you what I ask anyone who sits at this table. What do you know that you did not know yesterday. What can you do that you could not do yesterday. And who are you responsible for other than yourself.”

He liked her; he liked her enough that when he spoke he did not perform. “I know the sound,” he said, and the room went soft because sounds matter here. “I know it is old and I know that if you hum back a little wrong in the right way it makes a third note that buys you a breath. I can listen for it and tell you what the hinge is trying to do. I am responsible for goblins, for drains and ditches and people who think they are nobody but are handles of things they haven’t been asked to hold yet. I am responsible for people who write their names on cups and for those who didn’t get a cup because they came late and are embarrassed.”

“That’s the right answer,” said the grandmother in the cardigan, and everyone in the room acted like she had declared it merely adequate in order not to give her the satisfaction of a grin.

“What do you need,” Lila said then, and she had a pen but it was not a trick; she was going to use it.

“I need a room that isn’t this room where the city can meet without being asked to fold itself into your chairs,” he said, and he saw her wince in sympathy because chairs do what they can and never enough. “I need to borrow your radios for one hour and I need a bus. I need the cherry trees at Branch Brook to be patient with strangers, and I need your stubbornest person who knows the grid to sit with me for twenty minutes without rolling their eyes. I need you to be willing to believe that humming is an intervention and not an embarrassment.”

“The grid,” the sports-cheek man said carefully, and the EMS woman laughed without humor and said, “He wants to talk to 60 hertz and make it blush. I can get you a bus and a radio and a thermos with sugar in it. The park is having its blossoms like our city doesn’t get tired. The grid is a man named Roberto who will tell you something between five and fifteen lies unless he loves you, in which case he will tell you only three.”

“Tell Roberto I’m pretty,” Kez said, and someone down the table snorted because they had a sense of humor and also because he had said the thing he would say even if this room had been a different room and that made a person trust him a hair more than the badge did.

They finished by deciding things, an art he had never thought would feel like magic until it did. They laid out a line that would bring people in and let them stand not in the way. They wrote names on a whiteboard in a hand that belonged to a man who had been forced to learn penmanship by a nun and had never quite forgiven anyone but secretly enjoyed when people said they could read it. They made a stack of radios and a taller stack of walkie-talkies because the radios would run out of juice or interest and walkie-talkies have patient hearts. They assigned the grandmother a role that consisted of being in charge of whatever nobody remembered to be in charge of and she took it with a flare of joy that could have powered five blocks.

When they were done, Lila walked him to the door and said, “You are going to be asked to be alone very often now. You are not allowed to do that. I am telling you this as a condition of your badge.”

“Condition accepted,” he said, and in appreciation her mouth did an exact half-smile, which is the engineer’s smile because symmetry is a flirtation but not a solution.

Branch Brook Park had put on the sort of soft pink it takes the rest of the state years to forgive. Cherry blossom season makes people get married or break up or write very long texts they never send. Today it had also attracted a certain breed of person who stands under a tree and says nothing because there are moments when the body acknowledges it is a guest without being told. Kez walked the long path under the rain of petals that makes even men with phones in cargo shorts gentle and felt the hum in the nail tune itself as if to a choir it had been expecting.

The bus rolled up with Luz at the wheel and the low sigh of brakes that always sounded to him like a person putting a heavy pan down with respect. She had taped a paper sign in the window that said in crooked block letters COMMUNITY ENGINEERING and had put on lipstick so red it dared anything not to work. She got out and thumped him on the back with controlled affection and towed him inside where the radios were in a tidy pile beside a cooler that informed him by smell it was full of little milks.

“I brought Roberto,” she said, and angled her chin toward a man in a T-shirt that had been white in a different decade and now was a map of stains. He had the look Kez respected in men of his tribe and of other tribes, the look of someone who had been blamed and shrugged and then gone back to work making something stand despite all the busy air. Roberto considered Kez as if assessing whether he would tip easy or at all, then offered a hand as if remembering the old laws of courtesy.

“You want to romance my frequency,” he said, and Kez nodded because there was no reason to pretend otherwise. “Everybody does,” Roberto added, not without pride. “You got a song.”

“I have a hum,” Kez said. “And I need to teach it to as many people as will stop long enough to learn. Teach is too big a word. Remind. The river gave us a tone and we made a third with it. The lines are going to get listened to next. I want them to have company when he plays his tricks.”

“You talking about a guy with a necklace like a boat and a mouth like a door,” Roberto said, and smiled for the first time, showing a chip in a front tooth that improved his face.

“That one,” Kez said, and for a moment the three of them looked out the bus window at the sky as if it might specialize in unlikely men.

They set up on the grass where the blossoms came down impertinently on people’s hair and shoulders like confetti thrown by a child. Caliso’s Daughter staked a string into the ground and taught three teenagers to tie a knot that would not tighten until you told it to, and then to tell it to. The grandmother from the EOC unfolded two chairs and then took them back down and then unfolded them again in a different place because attention is a game and you can draw it where you need to sometimes. The EMS woman checked her radio and then used it to call her sister to ask for a pot with handles for later because no one with sense holds a pot without handles.

Kez climbed the small hill and stood not on a bench because benches have formal feelings but on the wide bit of path where the gravel has decided to make a point about being naturally organized. He put his hands out the way you do when you want to make a circle bigger and said, “If you can hum, hum. If you can’t, breathe like you mean it. If you have a string in your pocket because someone made a joke and you kept it, put it in your mouth and tie an ugly knot and call it perfect. Think of your least interesting neighbor and make as much love in their direction as you can without calling them by name. We are going to tune a little. We are going to talk to the part of the grid that thinks it is lonely.”

He did not expect it to work because expecting things to work is the first step toward wanting to live in a movie. He expected a teenager to smirk and a mother to hush a child and a man to cough and a woman to think about the shoes she should have worn. He expected to be an idiot for five minutes. What he got was a tone building like tea starting to be serious. People hummed stupidly and carelessly and with the full belief of those who have been tricked by songs into making a room worth living in. The sound was not pretty; it had the lopsidedness of a block where one building has decided to be art and the others are practical. It was what he had wished for, the beat frequency that made a third note that made the world pay attention.

Roberto stood with his arms crossed as if keeping his ribs from falling out and listened like a man revising. He closed his eyes. He opened them and was not embarrassed. He said, “Sixty cycles likes this,” and he made a small move with his fingers like he had adjusted the position of a knob that did not exist, and Kez felt the crooked nail go cool, which is how it announces interest. A girl of eight made a tiny, intense noise and then laughed because she had felt the light behind a lamp change its mind about where to rest.

They practiced for half an hour, if practice is what you call a collection of strangers acting like they know a thing together. Luz leaned against the bus and wiped at her eyes as if pollen were the culprit and barked orders at two teenagers who were trying to make a joke out of a plastic cone. Caliso’s Daughter dropped a comb and didn’t mind and then minded and then forgave herself for minding. The cherry trees threw petals and then more petals and the city snuck a look at itself in an unflattering mirror and said it could work with that.

After, as people broke up into pairs and triplets to pretend they hadn’t belonged to each other for a little while, Lila walked up with a clipboard like a weapon and sass like a scarf. She said, “We will do this at five more places before dark,” and he said, “You make a decision like it is a sandwich,” and she said, “I do make a superior sandwich and you will never be allowed to eat it because you don’t believe in mustard in the correct way.”

The grid would hum back around five, Roberto told them, when the air gets tired and more ovens turn on and the lights are all flirting together. Vox would likely test then because men who love leverage like to strike their pose against a skyline. Kez had two hours to go to three places and say the same stupid thing and make it feel like the first time. He did it with pleasure because he had always been good at telling the same joke as if he meant it. At a playground with the rubber mats that collect the same heat as a handrail, he taught humming to two mothers who rolled their eyes at him and then rolled them again because it had done something to their ankles they liked. On a stoop where a barber had set up a second chair and a third conversation, he taught humming to a man who said, “I cannot sing,” and then discovered his inhale could make a little tube of air feel less lonely. In a church where the saints refused to blink because they were saints, he taught humming to a group of old women who had their own languages for this and were too kind to correct him but who did it better with one breath than he did with a speech.

Around four, as he was walking back toward the bus with a paper cup of something that might have been iced coffee in a previous life and had decided now to be a sweet, he felt the nail tighten the way a sewing machine does when it gets a swallow wrong. The first note braided itself into the air like someone had unspooled a cable across the sky. It wasn’t the river’s note. It was thinner in a way that suggested training, not hunger. It tickled the back of his eyes. He looked up and saw, or felt, or allowed the feeling of seeing—sometimes those are the same—that the power lines along Bloomfield had straightened in a posture that said we are listening against our will.

The radios popped. Roberto swore lovingly at a panel in the bus and slapped it with his palm; the panel loved him and did what he asked because that is how you talk to machines if you are not a tourist. In a dozen houses, microwaves blinked 12:00 with a tragic dedication. The trains sang to the tracks in a higher register as if politely asking for forgiveness before they changed their minds. Lila stood on the bus steps and called through the walkie, “Locations Two, Three, Four, you hearing this. If you can stand, stand,” and the grandmother collected three children with the efficiency of a person who had once been a crossing guard and was still being a crossing guard in her bones.

Kez climbed to the top of the small hill again and did not make a speech. He said, “Breathe,” and the air made a sentiment of it. People hummed and the hum did that clever late-afternoon trick of going out across the water and coming back with news. The note from the lines tried to sit in their hair. The note they made themselves invited it to sit in their hands instead. There is a difference. Vox, wherever he had chosen to be, showed his delight by pushing, and the push came up against a thing the city had built hastily and well, an invisible chair that wasn’t wobbly, a chair with a back and an understanding that you don’t apologize for comfort.

At the crest of the hill, Kez felt his knees remember how to be anybody. He watched the air above the lines do a shimmer like a hot date. He reached into his pocket for the metro card and for something small he had not intended to use today, a coin he had bent into an oval with his teeth on a night he had been all mouth. He flicked the card at nothing so that a door could happen in his head if he needed it and he rubbed the coin with his thumb and thought of Aunt Verda holding a potato like it was a diamond because the knife she was about to put to it was sharp and that was respect.

The grid did not want to obey. It wanted to show off. It wanted to unload an old grievance. Kez didn’t blame it; he had had the same urge when he had worn his first good shirt. He made his voice low and steady and talked to it like a dog whose heart is too big for its body. “Not yet,” he said, and said it the way the planet had said it in his dream, and the lines quivered with the half indignation of being told no by someone who loved them. “Not yet,” he repeated, and the hum answered him with the beat note, and the beat note made a third, and the third let the power settle not like a curtain dropping but like a person sitting on the floor with their back to a couch, which is a posture that admits you will stay awhile and watch something ridiculous and grin at it.

Around him, people lowered their shoulders collectively; you could have put a glass of water on the air for a moment and it would have sat there obedient. The note from the lines softened into a purr he did not trust but was willing to tolerate. Vox’s trick did not break; Vox’s trick learned for next time the way a thief learns the reach of a new hallway. The chain around his throat, wherever he stood, probably burned or kissed or did whatever such chains do when you ask the world to be vulnerable and the world decides, for now, to be contrary.

When it was done enough, when the radios went quiet and the buses settled and the cherry trees made a last extravagant decision about how much pink the ground could swallow, Kez sat on the grass and let himself be ordinary. People came by and put advice in his lap because they had watched him work and it made them want to make him better. “Bring water,” one woman said, and he saluted her as if she were proposing philosophy. “Wear better shoes next time,” a man said, and pointed to his own like maybe generosity could be object lessons. “Teach us the words,” a child said, and he said, “There aren’t words, there’s breath,” and the child said, “That’s a word then,” and he said, “Okay, you’re right, that’s a word,” because being wrong in front of a child is a little magic too.

He did not notice Vox until he was already sitting there, because sometimes the worst thing something can do is to choose to be unremarkable. The hat was wrong again in a different way, the paper folded to a weather report that wasn’t ambitious, the shoes dusty as if he had walked somewhere that did not want his feet and had been generous anyway. Vox considered the people on the hill with an expression that could have been worship in a different language. He did not look at Kez at first. He let Kez be part of a crowd and then he turned to Kez not because he wanted to but because the room demanded it, and rooms get what they want.

“You think this is going to save anyone,” he said, and Kez noticed with a small private joy that his voice was bearing a bruise, the kind you get on the inside of your mouth when you’ve been clenching your teeth.

“I think saving is a dumb word,” Kez said, and wasn’t surprised to hear himself sound like one of the aunts. “I think we are making it hard for you to do it lazy.”

“I am not lazy,” Vox said, and he did not bother to make anger into a performance because the only person who mattered would not be impressed by it.

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Kez said, and leaned back on his elbows and looked up through the blossoms as if the sane thing to do on an afternoon like this is to make flirtation noises at photosynthesis. “Because if you were, we could outwait you.”

Vox looked at the child who had asked for words, at Luz who was pretending the bus was part of her body, at Lila who was arguing with a clipboard as if it had dared her to put it down. He said quietly, so quietly that only the crooked nail and the bit of air that had decided to listen would hear, “Millions do make a sound, don’t they.”

“They do,” Kez said, and then because not every sentence has to be a thesis, he added, “Do you eat. I cannot picture you eating.”

“I consume,” Vox said, and as he said it he made a face at his own word choice because sometimes even villains are embarrassed by their brand. “I smoke. I drink. I do not sleep on purpose.”

“That’s a shame,” Kez said. “Sleeping is where you get told the things you wouldn’t tolerate while awake.”

“I am not in the habit of tolerating being told,” Vox said, and then he stood, dusted his sleeve like it had tried to betray him by being a sleeve, and left without announcing what he would do next because he had learned from the city that suspense is free and looks expensive.

Evening thought about happening again. The park changed voices as the stroller opera ceded the stage to teenagers who pretended to be bored with everything and were not. The bus pulled away with a complaint of air and a promise of return. The radios got stacked again with the litter of other people’s sweat on their plastic skins. Lila shook Kez’s hand and said, “Mustard,” and he said, “No,” and she laughed enough to say she liked that he wouldn’t be trained easily.

He walked home because putting his feet on the city in long lines is the only remedy he knows for being looked at too much. On Bloomfield someone had chalked a hopscotch with numbers that went to thirty-two, which is what happens when you don’t know when to stop and luck goes along. On a fence, a flyer for an event at St. Lucy’s offered chairs and soup and a microphone with tape on it; it was his handwriting on one corner where he’d written bring string in lowercase, humble as a request and not an order. On a stoop two boys had a boom box that used to be a joke and was now an heirloom, and they had it turned to a station where a DJ with a voice like a couch kept interrupting the song to call listeners by name as if he were passing them a plate.

In his attic, he washed his hands and let the soap get a little far up his forearms because there is something about covering your wrists in bubbles that felt like armor when he was small and did still. He looked at the cups and knew the names better than he had yesterday, not because he had tried but because belonging is a slow way to memorize. He laid one of the strings he had left—the only untied one, because Aunt Verda would haunt him if he walked around without at least one option—on the sill to let it think. He set the badge next to it. They looked at each other like animals meeting at a water bowl.

Somewhere in the building, someone was making dhal and someone else was making rice and someone else was boiling noodles and the three smells took turns being polite and then stopped being polite because all of them were delicious and none of them were going to apologize for it. He listened. He waited for the tug to tell him where to stand. It did not come as a yank. It came like someone had put a hand on the back of his neck and was warming it, readying the hinge for motion. He did not know where Vox would crack at next, a substation mouth breathing under Ferry Street or the skeleton of a factory that still thought of itself as a person even though it had become condos with a concierge. He would find out. He had a bus driver’s number and an engineer’s impatience and a chain-smoking enemy who treated truth like a hobby.

He ate two roti, cold and indecent, and then he took a photo of the badge and the string and the cups and sent it unspectacularly to three people with the caption that had gotten him into this mess and also possibly out of it: handles meet hinge. The three people—Luz, Inez, and a nephew of Mrs. Patel who had discovered you could make money delivering meals if you called it service—pinged back immediately with words that folded into him and made a kind of useful garment. He put his hat on because even in rooms where he did not wear it he liked to know it was there, loyal as a stubborn dog, and he stepped into the hall.

Below, someone had wedged the front door of the building open with a cinder block and tied it to the banister with string so that if it wanted to shut itself out of fear it could not. That small thing, that untidy kindness, made him grin so fast he had to lean against the stair to take it. You belong to drains and ditches and the place behind the billboard because it forgets, Aunt Verda had said, and he thought, yes, and also to this cinder block, and also to the knot. The city had made a decision to believe its hum mattered, and he had decided to let that be the language he liked best.

When he stepped outside, the street smelled like rain that had changed its mind. Somewhere far off, a train laid its cheek on a rail to listen for itself, and the nail in his chest lifted a little, nudged by a note so low it could have been the planet’s sigh or his own. He said aloud, to the block and the phones and the woman carrying a bag of oranges like it was her purpose, “Tell me,” and he wasn’t sure who he was talking to and he wasn’t sure who answered when a breeze under his hat flicked cold and then warm and said, Not yet, and he said, Okay, and he walked toward the place where he would stand when it was time.Chapter 6

By late afternoon the city had put on its blue coat and buttoned the second button wrong in its haste. The light did that complicated thing along brick where it finds every chip and ecstasy and writes them down as if for inventory, and the air had an edge of metal to it, as if someone two neighborhoods over had been filing down an ambition. Kez walked South Orange like a man measuring for curtains, eyes on cornices and wires, the badge and a length of clean bakery string warm against his ribs. The crooked nail under the bone did not yank or beg. It rested its palm on him, the municipal touch he had woken to, and it felt like being told to get your shoes, we’re going, not where, just going, and trust me, your coat is by the door.

He took detours because detours can be devotion. He ducked into St. Lucy’s even though the saints were very busy pretending not to register him. The vestibule had a plastic bin of stub-ends sunk like drowned worms in a sea of caked beeswax the color of tired milk. He put a bill in the slot because none of this is a grift and fished with two fingers for a lid of wax, the lid that forms when candle after candle tries and fails to complete itself. It came up heavy and perfect and smelled of old wishes and a thousand burned minutes. He wrapped it in butcher paper because that was what they had and because magic prefers a little grease on the wrapper. The woman folding pamphlets near the holy water nodded once, and he nodded back, and they had the kind of respect that does not require names because both of them belonged to the city in their different ways, which are not so different if you are paying attention.

At the corner, the bodega had a stack of red-and-white twine spools that knew they were beautiful and were pretending not to be. He bought two, and the boy at the register who had been born after the old bridge went down said, “You tying things up or tying them down,” and Kez said, “Up,” and the boy said, “Be careful, up is harder,” and the boy put three extra yards into the bag because his uncle had taught him about more.

The Emergency Operations Center called the way good rooms call, not with panic but with the precise forward tilt of people standing because if they sit they will go to sleep and there is not time for that. Lila’s voice on the walkie was focused enough to cut a rind. “Substation near Springfield Avenue is blinking like it has a headache,” she said. “We’ve got eyes on the catenary near Broad and the rails are acting like they got a compliment they’re not sure they deserve. We’re deploying lunches, radios, and grandmothers. You want the bus.”

“I always want the bus,” Kez said, and Luz responded with a horn two blocks away, a brassy opinion.

The bus, when it swung into view, had signage it did not legally own. Lila had gotten a sympathetic person at Traffic to loan over a magnetic placard that said TEMPORARY UTILITIES SUPPORT, and someone had written beneath that in Sharpie, in a hand with the emphatic gravity of a teenager feeling generous, BUT LIKE FOR PEOPLE. The bus breathed as if it were waiting for a river to speak to it personally, and Luz hung out the window in a coat the color of a patient cherry tomato.

“You look like a metaphor,” Inez said when she saw Kez, because it is considered rude to tell a goblin in Newark he looks like trouble when you want to keep knowing him. She had commandeered the first row and had set up her phone not as a camera but as an audio recorder, the little red dot steady as a pulse. She had found a pair of old headphones with a foam cushion missing on one ear, and she wore them around her neck like she was a radio show in a time that remembered radio shows could be intimate and not always performative. “Everyone wants to interview you,” she added without looking up, “and that means what they want is to make you smaller so you fit on their page. So I’m just going to listen and you won’t even be in it unless you say my name weird later on a stoop and I need to blackmail you.”

“You are very civic-minded,” he said, climbing on and letting the smell of brake dust and coffee sear something tender and needed clean.

“Civil,” Lila said from the back, and her silver at the temples looked like it might start to emit a comforting light if asked by the right god.

They drove north with the bus full of supplies that were also talismans and the correct number of roll of tape and a grandmother with a folding chair because you never know when a folding chair makes people stay. Roberto had arrived with two other men who smelled like transformers and sun, one named Eli who had a pencil behind his ear that had been sharpened with excellent attention and one named Iqbal who could probably build a sluice out of three spoons and a regret. They conferred about the humming with a seriousness that made Kez want to drag a string across the floor and let the conversation catch on it and play a note.

As they jolted over the tracks by the station, the bus did something that made every passenger lean instinctively toward the aisle. The power lines along Broad had made friends with sunset and were catching it in loops; they looked like arteries done right. The catenary above the commuter lines had that charged wedding-night quiver and the trains ran under it with their shoulders squared, trying not to show off. Kez felt the crooked nail pick up the higher note Vox had promised, not the river-deep tone but the careful metal whine of something built by human hands to be both safe and thrilling. He felt it at the roof of his mouth and in the bones of his ankles; he could see the note, if he let himself be a little ridiculous, like fishing line strung from pole to pole with a thousand invisible bells.

“Here,” Luz said, and yanked the bus into a no-parking with the confidence of someone who knows parking is a conversation, not a rule. They spilled onto the sidewalk, radios distributed, a roll of tape unfurled, twine slung from a shoulder like a guitar strap, and that slow municipal boldness that comes of being told to stay home and deciding no.

The substation near Springfield Avenue looked like a brick cottage had fallen in love with some wrought iron and they were trying to make it work in public. Lichen had written slowly in green along the base, and pigeons had opinions on the roof. A chain-link fence with a big orange sign announced a voltage nobody wanted to kiss. The air around it had that thrift-store ozone smell that clings to old speakers and new mistakes. Roberto put his palm on the fence and murmured something he would deny later because it sounded like he was asking it to tell him a story.

Vox was not on the fence throwing poses; he wasn’t anywhere obvious. That was instructive. The note braided itself out of nowhere, the same thin rigorous tone, and picked up on something inside the brick house that probably had a name like a saint and a function like God. The lights on the near block stuttered once as if they had reconsidered their life choices, and the railroad crossing arms off a block away twitched their shoulders and asked if anyone had permission to dance.

“Spread,” Lila said, without raising her voice, and people spread. It helps to be told a simple verb in a crisis. It gives the body an excuse.

Kez took twine and looped the first line around a lamppost that had been painted by three different crews in three different decades and wore its coats like pride. He tied the knot the way Aunt Verda would have wanted—solid, unflashy, obedient when spoken to—and hummed once into it, the stupidest little hum, nothing you would put on the radio, and the twine picked it up because twine is made for carrying things. He took the line across to the metal gate and made another knot, this one a little fussy because gates can be vain. He slowed himself down enough to remember: old things love old things. He laid the wax in the crook where the fence met the ground and pressed his thumb into it the way you do when you want to be fingerprinted by something that is larger than law.

“What are you doing,” Eli asked, not unkindly, and Kez said, “Making the air remember it is stubborn,” and Eli said, “Okay,” and refrained from rolling his eyes because Lila had asked him to.

A dozen more pairs of hands made lines, low and high, from signpost to post, from bus mirror to tree, from Lila’s clipboard to the grandmother’s folding chair. It wasn’t a web; webs imply catching. This was strings on a flat violin ready to be bowed. People put their fingers to the lines and made their throats do that thing humans are born knowing how to do and then forget because they have to work and pretend and be charming. The hum gathered itself the way steam gathers under a lid half off because you don’t want the pot to boil over and also you do.

The first push from Vox, when it came, came like new shoes that fit wrong on purpose. The lines along the rail lifted their shoulders higher, and the transformers in the substation asked little questions of their bosses and did not like the answers. Kez felt the trick of it—that push wasn’t brute. It was a seasoned hand on the pit of the stomach, telling all this built steel and copper that it had swallowed sadness and needed to burp it back out. He heard Aunt Verda’s voice in the fold of the sound: we belong where the city rejects the city. He thought how beautiful a rejection can feel when you have lived too long inside approval.

“Not yet,” he said aloud, a small prayer about timing, and the bus driver on his right answered with a whistle in three notes that would make a blackbird turn its head even if it was busy being a blackbird. People took the cue. The hum slurred a little upward, a collective accident that works better than anything rehearsed, and the third beat note wrote itself into the air the way cracks write themselves down old plaster, organically, with a mind that is also a body. Roberto hit the panel beside the fence twice, but less like a blow and more like a teacher with a chalk.

Kez broke open the wax with a gentle knuckle and molded three little medallions, thumbprint coins, one for each of them—the fence, the lamppost, the bus mirror. He pressed each into its metal and then into his own palm and then back, trading prints, building a small invisible chain among the neighbors. He spoke the word he had used the night before by the pier, the one that tastes like vinegar and smoke and makes iron think for a second about silk, and the fence agreed to be reasonable because it was flattered to be asked.

Power did not fail. Vox did not manifest, no doorway of heat-wobble and oil-slick skin. This was worse; he was getting elegant. He had sat up some place that overlooked this block and adjusted his chain to the right notch and begun to murmur, and the lines were listening out of fear of missing something interesting. Kez put his mouth close to the twine and spoke like a cousin at a wake. “Listen here,” he said, not loud. “He wants you to be dramatic so people will look at him. Do not give him the face he wants. Give him your profile. Pretend you are thinking of moving to another city because the rent is lower and you know you won’t go. Stand how you stand when the aunties are comparing coupons.”

Luz laughed sharply enough to tilt the note, and that was science as well as style; the hum went sour for a second and then sweeter, and the third beat-note leaned its shoulder against the thing Vox was making, and the stutter in the nearest ward’s lights stopped stuttering and began to blink like something intentional. Lila looked up at the crossing arms and they stayed obedient. Kez felt the crooked nail cool and then warm in a clean pulse: not yet, yes now, breathe, again. He obeyed. It was not tiring to be obvious when the job required it. It was a relief.

For a moment he thought of all the lines in this country, behind chain-link and under ground and written as maps and as power and as care. He thought how Vox could talk to any of it that had old ache in it, and how he could not get to the places where the ache was soft because the people there had warmed it. He thought the corny thought, the one he hates in other people’s mouths and loved in his own: You cannot talk a city into falling when it has decided to hold itself up with both hands.

The push abated without ceremony. No wave, no apology. The tone thinned and folded, the way you fold a good suit because you own exactly one and you intend to wear it to a better thing than this. The substation settled, and its brickwork ceased to look like a face making up its mind about crying. Roberto leaned his forehead on the chain-link like a man who would not take his lover’s hand in public but could bear to give a kiss to the shadow of it. Eli checked numbers on a meter as if he were calling bingo; Iqbal made a note on a pad he would never show anyone because it contained three spells and an inventory of bolts. The grandmother opened a thermos and poured coffee into a paper cup and put sugar in first because she loved somebody once who taught her to do it that way and it was a way to remember best things without being haunted by bad versions.

Kez looked up at the rails and then beyond, where the city turned itself outward toward the marshes, and he felt the tug on the nail twist in a way that meant a different geometry. Vox had wanted the rails to beg the wires; that had failed, and now he wanted to ask bone to talk to bone. The next hinge would not be steel. It would be something older, something made of dirt and meanness and memory. The city’s old basements. The crumbling vault of a culvert built when a man with a mustache thought himself the future. The drunk undergutters that remembered eels. Vox was coming for the skyways under the streets.

He ran the twine around his wrist twice as you do when you mean to keep something, and he turned to Lila. “Sewers,” he said.

She had the face for it already. “Already calling Water and Sewer,” she said. “They hate me. I don’t mind. I make good enemies. Where. Give me corners.”

He considered the map held behind his eyes the way your hand trusts the light switch in the dark. “Where the old brick meets the new pipe,” he said. “Where the foundations of old buildings didn’t get moved because somebody was lazy or holy. Where the city forgot a creek and named it something else on paper. The culvert under the old brewery. The stone mouth behind the bakery on Ferry they pretend is art. The thing under the lot where the cinema used to be.”

“Ballantine,” said the grandmother with the thermos, and her eyes lined up on something only people born here see, a family of ghosts going to church.

Luz was already halfway up the bus step. “I can get us three blocks from the brewery,” she said. “After that, it’s boots. I will not drive into a hole so do not ask me, civics or no civics.”

Inez slid into the seat behind her and shoved her headphones up over her ears, as if the city would speak to the foam more clearly. “You are not going underground without me,” she said, as if daring anybody to try to remember what gender has been historically asked to remain topside.

“Bring your red,” Kez said, and she grinned because he saw her.

They took turns saying to each other, not with words but with the small noises people make on sidewalks between chores, that they would be back. Roberto stood with his hands in his back pockets and chewed a word he never said and looked as if the substation might finally go to sleep and he could go home to a sink and a sleeper couch and a child’s homework. Lila sent two men the other direction with the grandmother because somebody in the Heights had decided to fix something with a wrench and a prayer and might need reminding that prayers go first. Caliso’s Daughter drifted sideways into the bus aisle as if she had been there the whole time, which is a thing someone like her can do without explaining. Brick followed at a distance and then closer, the slyness gone out of him, a boy wearing his seriousness like borrowed shoes.

The brewery pretended not to be a brewery in the way elected officials pretend not to have a history. Someone had turned part of it into something with couches and small plates and the kind of lighting that cares what you think of it, and the rest into units where a concierge who had gone to college for hoping talked to people about packages. The brick, however, remembered barrels and boys and a smell that would turn your stomach if you weren’t born to it. Behind the new fence and the old wall and the lies, the river had a ditch with stones worn down to nouns. And there, knitted into the foundation of what had been a proper drunken building, was the mouth of a culvert built like a prayer book—sturdy, stained, language nobody speaks anymore, comfortingly rectangular.

It breathed. Kez could feel the slow exhale of it as if it were a dog asleep under the stoop, old enough to have decided it wasn’t going to be asked to fetch again. He pressed his palm to the stone and the stone muttered in a way that might have been Latin or might have been rats. The crooked nail downshifted, and the beat came up from under him now, not over, and the tone Vox threw at the culvert did not try to make water feel mortal. It tried to make the old masonry remember being pulled out of a hillside and forced into shape. It tried to remind the culvert of the panic caught in mortar when a perfectionist realizes the clock will win.

“Don’t thank him for memory,” Aunt Verda had told him about a different man, a different night. “He thinks he invented it. That’s how he’ll take it away.”

Kez tied twine across the mouth of the culvert at ankle level and hip and shoulder, three lines, and kept the knots dirty, old-fashioned, humiliating for the string. He smoothed wax against the stones like salve. He burned a tiny nub of candle without lighting it because there are ways to make fire inside wax if you ask with the right breath. He spoke the house words, the ones he didn’t lend to anybody else even in a pinch, because if magic is a dog it still deserves some bones nobody else gets. The hum arranged itself under his hands like a blanket shaken out over a bed, and the beat note resolved into something that felt like a heartbeat just behind his own.

Vox did not show. Vox did not need to show. The stone awoke and remembered its crush and, if left to it, would have wanted to shrug its rectangle and go back to being a hillside that takes rain and gives none back. The air over the bricks shivered with a thirst that had not been quenched since the canal was filled. Kez tasted old beer and new bleach on his tongue and spat involuntarily, which was rude and also the correct thing to do when a city tries to force a swallow it can’t manage. Inez crouched beside him with the business of someone at work and not a tourist, her headphones askew, her hand on the string at hip height with a familiarity that said she and rope got along.

“You feel that?” she asked, even though he did, and he nodded anyway, because it would have been ungenerous to deny her bravado.

“It’s him remembering what mortals did to him,” Kez said. “Not the first sin. The second. The one with intention.”

“Redeem him,” came from behind, in a voice older than the culvert and less entertained by the kind of language you use in rooms with grant money. Caliso’s Daughter had sat herself on a cinder block with the air of a hostess before people arrived, and she ran the comb out of her hair and set it on her knee. “Redeem is a small word. Use repair. Use return. Use remind. Do not tell the stones they can be saved. They are not interested.”

“Repair,” Kez said, and meant it like a promise and not like a lecture.

The first surge up from the sewer came in a sound like furniture, as if somebody under them were shoving a sofa down a hallway that had always been four inches too narrow. The strings snapped once, not the twine, the hum-strings in the back of the note. He reached with his hand and set his palm in the center of the hip-high line and the vibration came up his arm and his shoulder and laid a cool hand on his ear from the inside and said, You are the wrong size for this task, and he laughed, because everybody is the wrong size for every task until the task agrees to be pleased.

Luz braced her feet wide and put her palm to the ankle string and whistled again, two notes and a compromise. The grandmother, who had come in the bus because she refused to be assigned to anything that did not allow for the possibility of finding a story, braced the shoulder string with the heel of her hand and said, “Hush,” to the culvert the way she had said hush to babies and to men who wanted to make a point during Bible study and to her own knee when it tried to talk her out of standing for another hour at a voting site in a storm. The three notes together—the whistles, the hush, the hum—met the sewer’s push and told it, Unclench.

For one second, it did. In that sliver of a second, Kez saw down into the tunnel not with his eyes but the way you see down into a memory. He saw men laying brick on brick, sweat arrowing off noses black with soot, a boy, sixteen and trying to be thirty, carrying mortar in a pail too heavy, a supervisor with a moustache so certain it had its own name. He saw someone kiss a stone, quick, superstitious. He saw a handprint half set and then smeared because somebody had shouted. He saw the mortar take the smear and keep it forever. He saw water come down out of a summer thunder and rush the culvert and the culvert swell with pride and the culvert later, years later, dry and small and resentful when a pipe was put through it that did not ask permission, only forgiveness.

He spoke to that smear. He said, “Thank you,” which made no sense except in his throat it did, because it was the boy’s, because it was a human mistake made visible that never got punished. He told the smear it had been seen. He told the hand he would carry water for him for a day, that he would take somebody’s bucket up two flights of stairs without complaint. He told the culvert it had done the work. He told the pipe it had been forgiven too aggressively by men who lied about their motives and he would pray for it. He spoke ridiculous little courtesies. The surge hit them again and receded not like a retreat but like your grandmother moving over on the couch to let you sit without letting you think you owned the couch now.

Vox’s trick failed again, quietly, in a place he would probably not admit he had visited. Somewhere, under a bridge, he paused to light another cigarette and made a very small face, not pain, irritation, which for a man like him is worse because irritation has no story to sell. The chain at his throat warmed under his fingers, and if anyone had been close enough they would have seen that his eyes changed shade, from oil-slick to storm-water, two codes for the same thing said in different tongues.

Kez, crouched in the wet, sidewalk grit in his shoes, felt the crooked nail not cool, not warm, not ask, but steady, a weight. He thought of the badge on his chest next to the string. The badge and the string still stared each other down on his sill in his head, and he realized with the patient alarm of a man recognizing he has done himself a kindness without intending it, that the trick now was not more magic. It was more people. It was thousands of little handles on the city, attached by twine and breath. It was the ridiculousness of giving a child a piece of rope and saying, tie it to that bench in such a way that the bench feels admired, and watching the child tie a knot that made the bench feel seen, which is close enough. It was teaching Brick to put a knot in his mouth and untie it with his tongue when he panicked, because sometimes you need a trick that is only yours.

“We’re not going to win fast,” he said quietly to Inez, still crouched, her hand a certainty on the string.

“Okay,” she said, and a petal dropped on her hair, a ridiculous miracle in this stupid corner behind a rich building and an old ditch, and she left it there because it meant somebody else had paid attention too.

“This is going to break something in us if we let it,” he said, and it was not his habit to be earnest in the middle of filth, but the culvert had old ears and deserved an offering.

“Okay,” she said again, and this time the okay was not bravado or flirtation; it was the sound people make when they carry a thing heavy but doable, the okay of the man at the deli when you order three pounds of something and he says okay because you are having a party and he is in favor of that.

Caliso’s Daughter lifted the comb like a baton and aimed it toward Kez without looking at him directly, which is how women who know your secrets give you permission to be stupid in public. “Teach them,” she said. “Teach them the little knots. Teach them the words that are breath and not poems. Teach them to make doors out of rec center walls and meeting agendas and the two inches of space under doors that never shut right. You are good at listening. Listening is the job now.”

He wanted to be a goblin with tricks and boots who pulled a scale of the planet back into the water with four strings and a stubbornness. He was also going to be a lecturer with a whistle and a spool of cheap twine. Fine. The city was telling him what it needed. The planet in his dream had said not yet. Sometimes not yet is a license. Sometimes it is a list.

They held the culvert until the surge softened and the tone in the sewer settled into a wet contentment that would have made Aunt Verda say, give it a sponge cake and send it to nap. Kez left the wax medallions pressed to stone where hands would pass; clumsy kids would pick them free and stick them to a notebook and then discover their pages smelled like church and glue and not know why their teacher looked at them with a fondness that made the classroom feel like a kitchen. He tied the last of the twine to the new fence at knee level and left it slack, an invitation that didn’t ask anyone to step over it, just to notice.

They stood up and remembered they had backs. Luz stretched and cracked and shook out her hands, the whistler refraining the three notes under her breath as if making sure her mouth remembered how to get home. The grandmother poured water over her fingers and flicked the last drops into the mouth of the culvert because this is the sort of superstition that won’t hurt anything. Lila checked her watch in the pure practical way of someone once married to a man who could not be on time and had learned to care even when it did not help.

“Next,” Lila said to the room of the city that always exists where people are being competent together, and the radio answered with chatter that did not sound like panic—Lines are okay on Bloomfield, we’re getting calls from the South Ward, a guy says his microwave blinked and then went back to normal without him, the dog barked at nothing for thirty seconds and then fell asleep, the light at the corner did a weird thing that might be because it was changing its mind about being alive, a nurse at University says the backup generator hummed once like it was coughing and then remembered itself.

They took the bus to where the cinema had been, the flat lot with three weeds that never die and a fence with concert posters wearing rain, and found a man sitting on the curb with his hands on his knees, tears going down his face and into his mustache. When asked he said, “It’s nothing,” and then, “My grandmother took me to see a movie here the night the lights went out in the seventies and we held hands and ate hot dogs in the dark and it was fine,” and he laughed because he had not meant to tell anybody that, not even himself. They tied twine to the handrail that had nothing behind it now and hummed until the lot felt like a room again, and the man shook their hands and went home to call his aunt.

At the last place before dark, a storm drain with a bad attitude on a block that had been expensive and cheap more times than there were years, Brick reached for a line he shouldn’t have. He put his tongue to a knot to show off and the note ran up his lips and would have burned a taste into him he’d never scald out. Kez slapped his mouth away with a speed that made parlor tricks look slow. He put his own palm to the knot and took the heat like a bouncer catching a glass before it hits the floor. It ran up into his wrist and nested under the bone where his crooked nail made its home; it scorched him cold. He went on talking as if he had not just given part of his hand to a trick because Brick needed the lie as much as the lesson. Later, when the bus was finally taking them toward food, Brick pressed his own thumb into the welt rising like a map on the inside of Kez’s wrist and said, “I am stupid,” and Kez said, “Not yet. You have so much room,” and Brick did not cry because he was at the age where crying is a felony, and the grandmother cried because she was at a different age where everything is allowed.

The night made a decision to be simple. That could be a trick; nights do that. The metro, which had promised to be a sarcastic partner forever, let its trains go on with nothing worse than long exhales. The lights kept themselves. The culverts murmured to themselves like a choir of men who had been allowed, for once, to sit down while singing. The city went inside to eat and then onto stoops to not admit it had been afraid. Vox did not show his face again, which did not mean he had gone. Kez could feel him at the edges of the map the way you feel a neighbor on the other side of the wall not being loud, exactly, just existing passionately.

On the bus, people leaned into their fatigue as if it were a better jacket, and Lila made a note and then another and then put the pen down and let the notes make themselves. Luz drove with one hand and sipped something from a thermos that would disqualify her from certain sainthoods and then put it down and switched to water because she intended to have a job tomorrow. Inez took the headphones off and hung them around Kez’s neck without looking at him because it is easier to give gifts sideways. He wore them because they felt like a small version of a crown that might, with time, be deserved.

At South Orange, the street had discovered a breeze. Someone had put a bowl on a stoop and written TAKE GOLD FISH which was not true because the bowl held nothing but bottle caps and two kisses of aluminum foil, and the lie had been the most honest thing anyone had made all day. Mrs. Patel had a pot on and a door propped and would not take no for an answer and made him eat lentils that tasted like sorry-you-were-outside and he had three bowls without shame. In his attic, the string on the sill and the badge did not look like they were about to mate. They looked like they had agreed on grammar.

He washed the wet grit off his wrists and watched the welt on the inside left raise itself into a map of a neighborhood he could not place yet. The crooked nail’s hum had changed key. It sat now not in a major or minor he could draw on a grade-school staff but in something older, something the aunties used when their vowels ran out. He lay on the floor next to the cups and whispered each name in marker, letting the sound fall out of his mouth and onto the floorboards so the house could have a catalog. He thought he might sleep, the hinge resting, the door on its pin. He thought he might dream of the planet again and say, not yet, like a bargain and not a denial.

He did sleep for a while. He dreamed he was in the EOC again, only the table was a map and the map was a surface and the surface was a skin, and when he put his hand to the place where the city had bent and then unbent the wood lifted a little under him as if there were breath in it. He saw the grid lines as strings and the strings as streets and the streets as the inside of a song he had been singing all day. He felt, in the dream, what the badge felt like around his neck—not authority, not permission, but a little rectangle of borrowed possibility—and he understood why people keep them long after they expire, talis-mans for days when they were trusted to sit where decisions were made.

When he woke it was to the small sound of paper under his door. He padded down the hall to find an envelope the exact brown of school and bureaucracy, the color of every dull thing used in the service of something that matters. Inside was not a letter. Inside were four strips of old-fashioned tickets, the kind you tear off at a raffle in a church basement, each printed with a number and the words ADMIT ONE. On the back of each, someone had scissored tiny notches, an old goblin code. The notches, together, spelled a word in a language that tasted like batteries. It was a word Aunt Verda had told him never to invite over if he intended to sleep. It was not Vox’s name and it belonged not to a person but to a place, an address under the address. It was the word for the room with the switches where someone once in a while used to turn the city off and then on again to keep it honest.

He held the tickets in his left hand because he had trained his right now to try not to burn. He stood in the attic and felt the nail press, not a command, a request. The hum of millions was still there, a quilt. Vox would try again somewhere else, with the merit of a man who has never learned to take no for long. The EOC would wake and brush their teeth and put on the hats of their childhoods and the shoes of their jobs. The bus would be a bus again in the morning until it wasn’t, and Luz would keep both hands on the wheel until she needed one for coffee. Inez would listen to tape and cut and cut and resist cutting the wrong silence. Lila would write notes that would be spells for a later day, and the grandmother would show up at a place not assigned and turn it correct with a folding chair.

Kez slipped one of the tickets under the wax on the sill so it would not blow away when the window decided to be a door. He tucked one into the ribbon around the badge. He pushed one into the pocket near his nail, close enough to hear it think. He put the last somewhere nobody would look for it, in the boot where Aunt Verda had left him words, because sometimes you bury a thing on purpose and sometimes you plant it and sometimes it is both and you don’t get to know which until it grows.

He sat back on his heels and said aloud to the house and to the three people who would hear him even if they weren’t in the room—Luz, Inez, Lila—“Tomorrow,” and the room said it back in pipes and in wood and in the tiny rush of air along the crack of the window where the weather comes in without asking. Down on the street a man laughed at a joke that didn’t need to be good. The planet turned her cheek on the pillow and said in his dream-voice, almost fond, Not yet, and he smiled like somebody had just handed him a handle that fit his hand and told him, go on, this door opens inward and out.Chapter 9

Morning, which had been so polite about arriving lately, came in with elbows and a to-do list. The attic felt like a mouth rinsed, clean and a little numb, and the crooked nail under Kez’s breastbone had that steady municipal palm again, the one that doesn’t say danger so much as agenda. He had slept hard enough that his face had stamped onto the pillowcase a faint map of the day before, and when he sat up the welt along the inside of his left wrist lifted its own head to ask if it had been worth it. He greeted the cups, one by one, because superstition and respect walk the same hallway and nod to each other without creating a scene. The ticket under the wax on the sill had stuck into the fat of it in a way that would make a child itch to pry; its red serial numbers showed through like an embarrassed cheek. The one tucked to the badge had positioned itself so the word ADMIT peeped like it had a joke it was almost ready to tell. The one near the nail felt warmer than paper should, as if it had learned to hold a pulse not meant for it. The one in Aunt Verda’s boot gave nothing away, which meant it was doing its job.

He took the wax off the sill carefully and freed the ticket without ripping the paper. The wax clung a little, as if torn between being a lid and being a seal, and when it came away clean he smelled last night’s prayers and somebody else’s impatience. In the quiet between radiator sighs and Mrs. Patel’s footsteps overhead, a memory nuzzled through: Aunt Verda standing with a roll of raffle tickets at a parish hall, tearing them off two by two with a pleasure like counting babies. She had called the roll a river, because it went and went and nobody ever got all of it, and because you never really own what you hold, you just escort it to the next person with the decency of a neighbor. He tore off one square by habit—tear, tear, the neat join—and slid the stub into his pocket with the strings as if a ticket could be a charm and a contract.

In the front room, Mrs. Patel had the television lit to a channel that specialized in well-intentioned panic. The banner at the bottom of the screen coughed out phrases, Phenomenon and Infrastructure and Citizen Response, while the faces above performed reassurance and alarm in pleasing ratios. She tisked at the anchor in a way that wasn’t personal, folded a towel in half, then into thirds, and put it in a stack so crisp you’d have thought the city had never broken anything. “They have your name wrong again,” she said, and he said, “They always do,” and she said, “Today I will learn their name and get it wrong with vigor.”

He took a roti because the argument was lost and blessed, and because it warmed the place under his tongue where he kept the words he was not supposed to lend to anyone. Mrs. Patel tapped the badge with her fingernail like it was a melon she wasn’t sure of and said, “If they ask you to sit in a chair too small for you, take the chair with you when you leave,” and he said he would, and meant it in a way both literal and not.

On the corner, the bus idled with the air of a patient animal allowed indoors. Luz had taped the TEMPORARY UTILITIES SUPPORT sign a little more crooked for effect and added a ribbon she’d found in a drawer because tape sticks better if you give it company. Lila was in the front with a clipboard that looked less like a weapon and more like a tool now that everyone had decided what they were doing mattered. Inez had the headphones at her neck and a notebook open on her knee; she drew a rectangle and then another and then shaded where the rectangles overlapped as if drawing the overlap could make it easier to live in. Brick lurked in the doorway in a way that said he intended to be told to go home so that he could be aggrieved about it, and when nobody did he looked vaguely disappointed and sat down with the bewildered dignity of a cat who has been asked to wear a hat.

“You look like you haven’t learned anything,” Inez said by way of hello, which she meant as affection, and which he accepted as such. He showed her the tickets without flourish, notches little dents along the backs like a music box’s teeth. She ran her finger along one and then sniffed it like the paper might have a moral. “Batteries,” she said, making the face a person makes when they suck on a nine-volt just to remember what it is they are. “Where do they go.”

“Under,” he said, and the way he said it made the bus shiver once in mild anticipation. “A place the city built and then pretended it hadn’t, so we’d be grateful when it worked by itself. The cutover room, the switchy place, the where-we-turn-it-off-and-on when we’re honest about needing to. The tickets are keys for a thing that refuses to look like a lock.”

Lila plucked one between forefinger and thumb and held it up in the bus’s steady light. “They used these as passes to the old console when unions and departments had manners about stepping on each other’s jobs,” she said, as if reciting someone else’s memory and finding herself the same age at the end of it. “Admit one meant one body at the panel, one decision at a time. We don’t do that anymore. We queue decisions like they’re orders at a deli and then we pretend there was no line.”

“Where is it,” Luz asked, because while she loved a story she had bought a bus to transport bodies, not narratives. “Don’t say under us. I will drop you and go get my nails done in protest.”

“Not under us,” Kez said, because he liked his face how it was and preferred to keep it, “but under where the old market used to be, the cavern where certain cold things were kept cold by chalk and patience. Somebody put switches in there when building the neat new world demanded it. Somebody left them alone when the neat new world got embarrassed about how it worked.”

“Ballast Yard,” Lila said, half to herself, the word wearing the ghost of a whistle. “Or under the courthouse where the steps are wrong by half an inch because the carpenter drank the week they poured. Your tickets say the market.” She tapped the notch pattern, reading the code like a cursive, and looked out the window as if the city might blush at being remembered.

They stacked the bus with enough rope to hum Christmas, a carton of wax that smelled like a candle shop owned by a church, an extra battery for each radio and three more because radios are children, and a bag of pretzels that Luz had knotted with string and christened emergency. The grandmother—whose name was Elsie if you wanted to be formal about things but who had introduced herself as that lady and had laughed—tucked a folding chair under one arm and a paper bag under the other. She had packed a loaf of bread, two apples, and a letter she meant to mail if she passed the right box; she refused to be a person who walked around without an errand unrelated to catastrophe. Roberto said he was staying with the substation near Springfield because the numbers there had developed a personality he meant to keep from becoming a tantrum, and he handed over a printed page with three lines of math and two crude drawings of a breaker and said, “If you get all the way to the board, don’t touch anything that hums at you without buying it a drink first,” which was the kind of advice you can take into any room and come out of it with the right limbs.

The market had been a market when men wore hats to shop and women traveled in packs that could chew a butcher to bones with questions. After, it had been a space where a roller coaster stored pieces of itself in winter, a warehouse for a company that moved paper, and a place where somebody had briefly tried to sell carved chess sets from countries that did not have the appetite for being imagined by Newark. It was now mostly emptiness and dust arranged tastefully into the suggestion of history. The freight door had been painted with a mural of fruits and the faces of saints who did not care for fruit. Nobody stopped them from driving the bus around back where a vine had claimed a chain-link, and nobody stopped them from unlatching a half-latch and asking the door to consider dignity.

Inside smelled like cool bread and bureaucracy. The floor was poured, cracked, re-poured, with the kind of patch that writes a poem about what it’s trying to be and then gives up halfway through because someone has to get home to a person who will say, How was your day. At the back, behind a caged-off staircase and a door that carried a brass plaque reading Mezzanine with the boredom of a building which knows it has only one, there was a metal gate with no handle. It had grooves where hands had run out of things to do. In the grooves, somebody had once wedged a penny that nobody had bothered to pry out with a knife. The penny had worn down to the size of decency.

Kez pressed his palms to the mesh and tried to listen to it the way he had learned to in rooms where everything had a job it was tired of. The tickets warmed. The mesh tasted of dust and a hundred unlearned lessons. He let his fingers find the knots of it and he hummed, low and ugly, on purpose, because not everything that works must be pretty. The mesh considered. Inez slid in beside him without asking, put her fingers through two squares, and breathed out in the rhythm of a song she had sung at ten into a hairbrush when nobody was looking. The bus idled outside like a dog lying just on the wrong side of a threshold because that’s the rule.

The gate unlocked without claiming it had, and when it slid aside it did so with a good temper that told you someone had oiled it in the last ten years while thinking of their grandmother. The stairs beyond were of the variety that do not like being called stairs: they were steps down into a throat between brick that had been braced by a cautious city engineer in the 1940s and then forgotten by the cautious city engineer’s third wife. Elsie set her folding chair aside without comment and put her palm to the railing like a blessing. “I have hurt my knees in this city for old men and for babies,” she said, as if to tell the steps not to get ideas, and they obeyed her and did not.

It was cool below, the air full of a latent sorcery that anyone with a fondness for machines can sense and most will pretend not to because the machines get jealous if you start talking about them like that. The room at the bottom presented itself slowly, a polite guest taking off its coat—the concrete, the distant thrum of something that could not be present and was anyway, and the panel, and the board, and the switches like the teeth of a dragon who has opted to be useful. There were labels in the old hand, black letters on white enamel, things like EAST TRUNK and CITY FEED and AUXILIARY. There were newer labels on plastic lamination stuck on cockeyed reading things like DO NOT TOUCH and YOU TOUCH YOU DIE in a hand that had been trying to be funny and had failed because it loved the person it was warning. A ladder leaned against a wall as if expecting to be called on for something heroic and perfectly willing to be sent home with thanks if not.

Kez felt it in his fillings: the old hum that made his crooked nail sit up straighter. The city had a heartbeat that made sense here, sixty and a little, the faithful domesticing of lightning into housework. He could hear with that other ear—the one that you get if you tape a nickel to your head for too long and get yelled at by an aunt—not just the wall-pulse but the stories stuck in the paint. Switches had been flipped here by men with soft collars and ratcheted cheeks, by women in wartime coveralls with their hair pinned into competence, by a boy once carrying a sandwich who had not meant to see anything and had seen too much and gone home with the look of a person who would end up moving to Florida and pretending not to remember. The phrase Not yet lived lazy in the room, practiced the way you repeat a word until it becomes a different word and you laugh because your mouth stops being sure what anything is supposed to be called.

He touched the badge on his chest and the ticket beneath it. They hummed in sympathy and in mockery, because no object, however borrowed, will ever let you forget it has its own agenda. The notch pattern on the ticket matched grooves worn into the lip of a little metal receiver tucked under the panel like a secret lover. He slid the ticket in and felt the old code catch. The slot swallowed the paper as if starving for something so flimsy it could separate itself from without causing a fight. A light the size of impatience came on above a switch labeled CUTOFF, and he did not touch it because Roberto’s look had gotten under his skin and made a home.

“Inventory,” Lila said, not of the room but of the people, and everyone said their own name in the way of the day after a disaster when you are expected to be amused you have one. “Civil,” she added for herself with the dryness of a woman who had earned effacing and refused to cash it. “We do nothing until the room remembers us without thinking,” and she put her hand flat on the panel the way you put your hand on a frightened animal, letting it smell you.

The voice came not from the walls or the radios or the hole in the floor that had ambition written on its cement; it came from the place in the body that manufactures permission. “So many handles,” Vox said, and because he speaks titles like he invented them the word sounded like a compliment in a language that doesn’t do compliments. He stepped out of a stripe of shadow like he had paid extra for it and adjusted the chain at his throat to show he had not. He had a strip of gauze taped at his collarbone under the metal, a human concession that made him more dangerous, because a creature that bleeds and continues voluntarily is the kind you cannot bore into leaving.

“You brought a club,” he said, tilting his rings to let the room see itself in ten little circles the color of bad decisions. “No uniforms. No ceremony. It would be sweet if it weren’t effective.”

“We brought chairs,” Elsie said, unfolding hers and sitting with the authority of a person who has folded and unfolded chairs in situations bloodier than this. “You keep standing all your life, you get wrong knees, boy.”

Vox laughed, not to be polite but because the laugh reached out from inside him like a traveler who will tip if you give him a good story. “I came to make an offer,” he said. “I will turn the city off. I will make the quiet you cannot make in any other way. I will let her sleep. And then, when she sighs awake, she will have the angle I have been practicing in my hand, and you all will have a chance to be something more than coffee and honor. All you must do is not interfere while I pull the pin.”

“The planet said not yet,” Kez said, because he could not resist being both a parrot and a brat. “She said it like a mother who knows when bed happens. You can be a lullaby if you like, but you don’t decide bedtime. You can stand in the hall and make faces while the rest of us tell the city a story.”

“The planet tells no one anything,” Vox said amiably, which to a person like him probably felt like an apology. “She sighs and everyone writes it down as guidance because it is easier to love a god when she sounds like a grandmother. What I am offering is not blasphemy. It is expertise. I have my hand on a hinge you have only ever kissed with that ugly little sentimental mouth.”

He moved without moving toward the panel. Kez could feel the pressure of him the way a tomato feels a thumb. The lights on the board answered like skirts lifting to run. The CUTOFF switch hummed at him with a note eager as a boy. Kez watched Vox’s hand hover and thought of all the hands that had hovered here that were not rumor, not theatre, not chain. He saw, as clearly as he could see the red of the ticket glancing behind the slot’s lip, a girl in 1966 with a pin at her throat and chalk at her fingers, a man in 1983 with a cup of coffee so sweet it might have cracked his teeth, a woman ten years ago who had cried alone after a call about her sister and then wiped her face on her sleeve and put her fingertips to this panel because people were waiting for lights.

“Admit one,” he said, softly, to the panel, to the room, to the cut of the air between Vox’s palm and the switch. “It never said admit only.”

“You must choose,” Vox said, and Kez loved and hated the way the man made even obvious things sound novel. “You must pick a city that is a museum or a city that is a body, and if it is a body, you must choose to change it, to break bones and set them different. You don’t have the hands for the set. I do. Your little broken wrist—” his eyes flicked to the welt, and it burned obligingly—“hasn’t set anything. It has only asked for reprieve. I haven’t met a goblin sentimental enough to prefer reprieve over remedy until you.”

“You haven’t met enough goblins,” Caliso’s Daughter said, comb laid across her knees like an altar. “You like broken because you like the crack. We like broken because of what happens after. We like mending. There is glory in tape if you put it down right.”

“I do not do tape,” Vox said, and for a second the mouth he wore lifted its corners and showed the mouth underneath, the one that isn’t flesh so much as result. “I do welds.”

“Then weld yourself shut,” Luz said, and whistled a single straight note that refused to be learned from. It hit the panel, bounced, and sat in the corner like a stubborn cat.

Kez slid the ticket he had hidden at his nail into the second slot he had not seen until a moment ago—a twin to the first, tucked under a different lip like a friend’s spare key. A second light woke above a breaker labeled MANUAL, a switch that nobody relied on because people still think a hand has to be smarter than a mind. He didn’t touch it. He did not want to be the person who touched it. He wanted to show the room that it could look up from the person trying to seduce it and remember its own redundancy with pride.

“Admit one can mean you,” he said to the room. “Admit one means admit me. Admit one also means admit the city. You have four tickets. You have a house. You have a badge. You have an aunt. You admit one, you admit all those ones, because they live in each other like rooms.”

He reached into his jacket and pulled the wax he had wrapped in butcher paper and the stub-end of a candle. He pressed the wax to the lip of the panel where a seam had been made with either love or impatience or both. He pressed his thumb into it and then pressed it to the cool steel until he felt the temperature exchange like a secret. He put his palm on the badge and felt the rectangle humming along the line of civil, which is a word that means serious about being together even when the together is exhausting. He waited for the room to register the smallnesses.

Inez, who had never asked to be anybody’s witch and had become one out of vocation and refusal, slid one ear of the headphones up and hummed the hum she had convinced two parks and a barber to learn. Lila, who disdained mysticism not out of boredom but because mysticism is messy and she likes her mess in labeled bins, put two fingers—index and middle—on the panel above the AUXILIARY and counted to eight in an old count used by drill teams and choruses and people who shelve books. Luz whistled that single straight note again and again, making a rail of it. Elsie put her folding chair where the concrete cracked and said, not loud, “Okay,” the way you do when you are lifting a person’s weight off a sidewalk with your good arm. Brick reached for the twine around Kez’s arm and then stopped because he had learned enough to recognize when his hand was a bad idea. Caliso’s Daughter laid the comb against her palm and tapped it twice, a tiny sound that does nothing unless you know you are in a room that has agreed to make something out of it.

The panel shivered like a dog remembering what the beach is. The switches settled, the lights across the board arranged themselves into a pattern that said I am a person if you will let me be. Vox made a face that would look to a stranger like delight and to anyone who has had a brother like insult, and then he stepped one step closer because sometimes the move you have left is proximity. His ringed hand reached past Kez, past Lila, past the badge and the wax and the proper teeny sacraments, to lay a single knuckle against the CUTOFF.

Air left the room for a fraction. The electrons in the wires above them shivered. The trains across town staggered in their courage for a moment and then remembered their mothers. The hospital backup hum cleared its throat behind two concrete walls. The city took a breath as if someone had insulted its coat and it had nearly chosen to take it off. The crooked nail in Kez’s chest did a trick he had never asked of it: it cast. The hum they had made in three parks, under one culvert, beside two substations, with ribbon and comb and chairs and four tickets, leaped out the front of his chest and smacked the panel square across the face.

It wasn’t physics. It wasn’t not physics. It was the city, seeing someone it loved about to make a bad choice at a party and stepping between them and the punch bowl with a joke. The panel took the smack like a gentleman, put its shoulders back, and rejected the knuckle not out of anger but in favor of form. The light above MANUAL did not go out. The light above CUTOFF did not brighten. The bulbs held their breath the way you hold your breath when someone is making you a promise and you are giving them the ropes with which to tie their own knot.

“Not yet,” Kez said, to Vox, to the room, to the part of himself that dearly wanted to see what would happen if they did the loud thing. “We will do this the way we do everything. With chairs. With strings. With too many people. With the kinds of permission you can’t laminate.”

Vox closed his hand. He could have snatched the switch. He could have blown the light out with the kind of attention that makes glass sag. He did not. He put the knuckle down on the panel and rested it there like you put your forehead to a door behind which someone is sleeping and you want them to wake up because you insist they hear the thing you think is important and you do not want to be the person who wakes them wrong. When he spoke, it was small enough that the room had to lean in. “You are going to tire,” he said. “You are going to stand for days and then weeks and then you are going to remind people to hum while their mouths are full and their kids are in the bathtub and their bills are due and their feet are wet. And they will. For a while. Because you are likable, Kez. Because you are delightful. And then they will go back to being citizens who want what has always been wanted: an easy day. And then I will come and I will pull the pin and you will cry and call it surviving.”

“I am not alone,” Kez said, because he had trained his teeth on that sentence until it had learned to go where he sent it. “And you are not what you say you are. You are not a hinge. You are not a remedy. You are a fever. Helpful to a body only because it makes everything else remember it is alive. I will take you. I will. In the dosage a human can survive.”

“We will,” Lila said, very civil, and Vox’s head turned toward her as if he had forgotten there were other people in the room who did not believe in him and had the powers to implement their disbelief. “We will write memos and get all the wrong permits and all the right ones and we will tell union men to eat their sandwiches while someone else flips a switch if needed and we will write down the steps so that when we wake up tired we can still do them without being geniuses. We will change the date on last night’s plan and use it again tomorrow. You are a hobby for us. A weekend. A bad job on the side that makes the stories better. That is what civil means.”

Elsie’s chair creaked in agreement, and any room that has loved a good chair will tell you that creak is a benediction. Inez wrote one word in her notebook so hard the pencil nearly broke and the word was keep. Luz rested her cheek against the back of her hand and whistled a note the kind of bird who hates being impressed will still keep and try on in the shower.

Vox stood for a moment and did the most surprising thing he had done since rising a scale of the planet from the river like it had been waiting for him: he nodded. It wasn’t a bow; he didn’t know the angle. It wasn’t respect; that is a coat he owns but wears rarely because of how it pulls at the shoulders. It was acknowledgement. The chain at his throat slid into a slightly different home along his collarbone, and the missing link scar gleamed as if proud of itself. “I will take your city into the dark,” he said, and his voice had gone kind. “Not now. Not like a thief. When she begs me for it. And she will. Not because she is tired of being awake. Because you have taught her to love quiet, and because she will love it enough to ask for it properly. I will do it then. And you will stand here with your tickets and your wax and your chairs and you will watch and you will hate it and you will thank me because you will know how to wake her again.”

He took one step backward, and the shadow that had held him made room for his retreat with a grace that implied practice and relief. He didn’t burn the air. He didn’t turn the lights into threats. He left them, and in leaving he left behind the smell of cigarettes smoked outside a movie theatre and a faint overlay of cologne unhealthy for teenagers.

Kez’s knees presented their invoice. He did not pay yet. He placed the last ticket—the one he had tucked into Aunt Verda’s boot—face down on the lip of the panel above a blank bit of metal that felt like an idea and drew with the edge of his thumbnail a small notch where there should have already been a notch. The paper took it. The metal took it. The panel hummed appreciation like a dog saying finally. He said, not loudly, to whoever in the room kept lists, “Admit one: Aunt,” and the light that had no reason to light flickered once and then settled, and for one breath the room smelled of flour and the little burnt sugar of a pie crust that got brave and stuck to the tin.

Lila took her fingers off the panel and wrote something on the clipboard that was not a note so much as a spell: numbers, then names, then a single long line. “We will need volunteers who are rude,” she said, because everything has a gate and gates do not prefer please. “We will need whistles cut to pitch. We will need to buy enough cheap string that the woman at the dollar store starts calling the police and then stops because she is too busy tying knots herself. We will need to tell the mayor to stay home unless he wants to show up without a tie. We will need to tell the stations to stop saying phenomenon and start saying work.”

“We will need chairs,” Elsie said, and patted hers. “Chairs for the people who never get them. Chairs in the rooms where they give them to the wrong men. Chairs on corners where boys think they gotta stand all the time to be seen.”

“We will need stories,” Inez said, because she had decided she was not going to mention the word media in this room and be thrown out of it. “Ones that fit in your mouth while you’re washing dishes. Ones you can tell in the dark that do not scare children and yet do not lie.”

“We will need a bus,” Luz said, which everyone knew and did not say because they liked her saying it. “Gallons of diesel if I must, prayers if you got them, a mechanic with hands like a saint and a socket wrench no one steals.”

“We will need to let people not show up sometimes without making faces at them,” Caliso’s Daughter said, and her eyes caught and held Brick’s, which stilled him. “We will need to be serious and look unserious so as not to scare the kind of men who only like to be told what to do by children.”

Brick said nothing, which was growth, and then he said, “Teach me to tie the knot that listens better than the person who tied it,” which was more.

They stood in the cutover room until the room knew them and not the other way around, which is how houses like to be treated and how switches will behave if they have been given enough time. Kez retrieved two tickets because even in magic there is cleanup. He left one in the slot and the wax on the seam. He took a pencil from his pocket that he had stolen long ago from a polling place, the kind attached to a string, and carefully wrote on the inside of the panel door where nobody would look except people who needed it, the one sentence Aunt Verda would have wanted on a lintel: Not yet is a kind of promise.

They came up into late day so perfect it would have been insulting if the city hadn’t earned it. The bus breathed hello with a good breath. The market tried to remember the names of cheeses. Somebody two blocks away practiced trumpet with such sincerity the wrong notes blushed. A boy on a bicycle turned his head and hit the curb and did not fall because sometimes the world is merciful to the sloppy. Kez looked at the sky with its wash of dull-blue and its seamed clouds and thought of hinges on cabinets that have been opened and closed thousands of times by stupid hands and still do their job, and he thanked them because somebody should.

He didn’t go home yet. He had a stop. The church had posted office hours for forgiving and none for forgetting and he respected both. St. Lucy’s door had been propped with a pot that had once held a plant and now held devotion. He went to the stub-ends and did not take any because he had taken his share; he put one of the tickets nose-down into the wax bucket like a sundial that refuses to tell deadline time. “Admit one,” he said to the saints. “Admit so many,” he said to the benches. “Admit me when I am wrong,” he said to the mean little lectern and the brass plate that had a name scratched out. The church said nothing. It didn’t need to. He was already admitted, which is the kindness rooms reserved for those who knew when to leave.

At the corner, a little boy with a cape made of a supermarket bag ran in a long arc across the sidewalk and announced to the air, “I am in charge,” and three pigeons took off in astonishment and approval. Kez stood a second longer than the situation required to clap for the boy’s authority; the boy did not look at him, which is how you should accept applause when you are practicing. The crooked nail pressed, not a warning or a yank, just the reminder of a hand you have agreed to hold for longer than is comfortable. He adjusted his cap and made a face at a cloud and walked toward South Orange with his hands free for whatever he was asked to carry by someone polite enough to ask.

Night did not pounce. Night asked permission. The city granted it. Lights came on in windows where the curtains were thin on purpose and thick by accident. The trains exhaled and then breathed as if into a cupped pair of palms offered by someone who knows what it is to hold something hot without getting blamed for the heat. Kez ate bread with lentils on his stoop and watched the street absorb more of itself. He held the badge and the string and the empty ticket stub and he smiled because he had accidentally become a filing system. He thought of Vox in a room without witnesses practicing a nod until it did not feel like a concession, and of Lila writing next to numbers a new kind of name. He thought of a sentence he had not earned that had come out like it belonged to his mouth: Not yet is a kind of promise. He put it on his tongue and rolled it around like a candy that cuts, and he resolved to mean it.

When he slept, the dream did not change him. He changed inside it. He stood at the panel and moved nothing and everything. He felt the city’s hum as a garment he could throw over someone. He woke in the dark once to the sound of an engine idling two blocks away and knew it was Luz because she has a way of waiting that makes her engines sing a note like patience. He woke in the gray once to the sound of a man on his phone saying, I can come tomorrow, can you come today, okay, okay, and he knew from the sound that the man was promising nothing and trying anyway. He woke for good and didn’t bother with the clock. He already had the day’s first answer. The nail hummed that steady palm. The house, brave little house, had written his name in the dust on the sill and then been embarrassed and tried to pretend the letters had arranged themselves. He put his finger through them and made them ugly and true.

He had a bus to meet, a room to revisit, a number to put on a page where numbers weren’t used to being alone. He had tickets in his pocket that no longer admitted anybody to anything but that smelled like the breath of rooms you go to when you need to be permitted to help. He had a city that had decided to believe itself. He had a villain who was trying out kindness like a new tie. He had an aunt who had left her recipes under his bed and her instructions under his skin. He had to tie three knots and teach ten more and answer twenty messages that said I can’t come today and here is what I can send and one that said I don’t know you and also you are my cousin now. He had, as Brick had put it in an unguarded moment with a soda breaking his heart in his hand, an unflattering amount of responsibility. He had time in which to keep saying okay. He had, as far as the crooked nail could tell, not yet. He went anyway.
