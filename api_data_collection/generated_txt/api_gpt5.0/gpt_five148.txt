The city creaked awake under a sky like a stretched bedsheet, blue and cold at the edges and pale where the sun pressed its hand through. A dew-slicked truck idled behind the municipal building, coughing a ribbon of white that the wind shredded and sent along 1A toward the trees. Inside, lights hummed their quiet neon hums, and a man with a mop and a knack for humming along ran the mop head under the tap and shook it mostly dry. The floor, the glass, the tiny constellation of crumbs under every chair—these were the universe right now. Spruce Grove at five-thirty was a kingdom of keys and the soft squeak of rubber soles. Not romantic, but then some romances are slow.

Owen Halvorsen worked in splotches of concentration. He could focus so hard that the clock failed to move, or he could drift and find himself an hour lighter without a clue what path his thoughts took. He liked being first in a place, liked the rawness. The night janitor had left him notes on pink paper: Missed corner behind the filing cabinet, sorry. Coffee exploded in the second-floor corridor AGAIN. God bless the woman who drew three smiley faces to soften the facts. He smiled back in his head and took his bucket, wet as a lake with soap water and the smell that promised citrus and probably killed very small organisms in shock.

As he worked, he considered pies. This was an old habit, like pocketing bottle caps and turning them over to see what they hide, or whistling without meaning to. Pies were circles. Pies were decisions made with hands and heat and timing so precise a whole afternoon could go wrong because you blinked. Pies were comfort and competition and the time he’d won a ribbon at a charity event because he could eat a blueberry pie faster than any of fourteen men and three brave women with faces adorned in purple like war paint. That was two summers ago. He could still taste the berries. He could still feel the wild, childish grin when the crowd clapped for nothing more profound than a man finishing something he started.

“There he is,” said Inez, materializing in the hallway like a ghost in a beige cardigan. She moved as though the building were her instrument and she played it quietly. “Already in your gospels, Owen? The Book of Mop?”

“You say that like mop isn’t sacred work,” he said. It might have been, depending on the day. Some days he loved the way a dull tile could be convinced to shine. Some days his wrists ached and everything felt last on the list. He wasn’t twenty anymore, wasn’t fifty either, but the clock had teeth.

Inez peeked into his bucket. “That water looks like Old Man Winter let his dog in. When’s your break?”

“Ten minutes,” Owen said. “Got all the glass to do first. The city likes seeing itself in its own reflection.”

“You always had a mouth on you,” she said, but warmly. “Don’t forget to eat. You’re a hanger.”

“Hanger?” He knew, but she liked saying her words.

“A hangry man. A hanger. It’s not the worst thing to be.” She patted his arm and drifted toward the council chambers, smoothing a plastic runner like it was a silk sheet in a hotel no one could afford. “You hear there’s some kind of fair next weekend? Out by the ball diamonds. Music and booths and a petting goat, I imagine. I’ll knit that goat a sweater if someone gives me ten bucks.”

“Petting zoo at the community fair. That’s real.” He’d seen the flyer, only it wasn’t the goat that had caught him. It was the photo of a pie with the crust crimped like a careful child’s art project, edges pinched so perfectly they looked machine-made.

“Oh, and they’re doing a pie thing,” Inez said, as if she’d plucked the thought from behind his ear. “Eat until your stomach sues for divorce. You going to show them how it’s done?”

“Maybe,” Owen said. He tried to sound casual. He felt like a schoolboy with a note burning in his pocket.

He worked the squeegee down the glass doors and watched the sun change the town from suggestion to detail. The parking lot gathered cars; a man in an orange vest stacked cones like the start of a great and temporary monument. A woman with a clipboard scolded her phone. He liked being apart from it, but not too far. The mop water went down the drain like a promise fulfilled. He ate his sandwich at ten exactly in the break room, the sugar packet someone had spilled under the kettle glittering like a corsage for the floor, and he Googled “Spruce Grove pie eating contest rules” on his will-of-the-wisp cell service. He found the fair’s page, with fonts that suggested enthusiasm but screamed budget. Qualifiers Thursday night at the community arena. Finals Sunday. Waiver required. No hands allowed. No puking. Cleanup provided. The prize: a ribbon, a trophy shaped like a pie slice, and a cash envelope that would make a small dent on a credit card bill. It wasn’t about the envelope. It never really was.

It was about being seen, his mother would say if she were still phoning him in the mornings. But she wasn’t, and sometimes that silence made more noise in him than anything else. His father, a quieter man, still called on Sundays and inquired about the weather like the weatherman’s script and then slowly sketched out the real talk, the worries, the small glories. Dad would not be impressed by a pie trophy. But he would come and clap, because that’s what fathers like his do. He’d clap once at first, politely, and then when he thought he was alone on the second clap he’d let it be a cheering sort of clap, too many claps for a man of his reserved nature. Owen could see it. He could hear the old man’s truck rocking on the gravel as they left, his dad saying, “Well, there’s something you can tell your grandchildren when you have any, which you absolutely will if you stop judging women based on their pie opinions.”

He laughed out loud at nothing, startling Inez, who peered at him over a stack of municipal notices like a prairie owl.

“Don’t fall down in that giggle fit,” she said.

He didn’t.

He finished his shift at two with a soreness he catalogued as manageable. He clocked out and shrugged into his denim jacket because evenings even in June could be a trick, a tease, a last-cold breath. The Blue Spruce Bakery was three blocks down and implicitly part of his route home. He didn’t have to stop, but he always did. The window had a hand-painted tree that someone with more confidence than skill had done, the needles a little too bright. Inside, the smell convinced you good choices existed and could be eaten with a fork.

Mira was behind the counter with her hair in a knot that said she had fought with it and won. She had a face that gave away her reactions in an honest way, like a good book with the last page missing.

“You again,” she said, squinting, which he had learned meant she was pleased to see him but refused to make a big deal out of it.

“Me again.” He tapped the glass case. “That one. The—what is that?”

“Saskatoon berry,” she said, handing him a paper bag as if by magic. He hadn’t seen her reach for anything. She moved as if the bakery were her body and the cinnamon twists were fingers she fidgeted.

He paid in coins as he often did because something in him liked the sound. It was old-fashioned and he knew it. She counted the coins with the rhythm of someone who had done this in high school at a craft fair when no one was watching.

“Why do you come here when it’s clear you’re a Tim’s man?”

“It’s clear?” He held up his coffee like a man caught at a crime.

“It’s clear from your eyes, which are glassier than any normal person. That is not quality brew,” she said, and slid him a wink and a small chocolate cookie he hadn’t ordered.

“I like both,” he said. “I’m entering a pie-eating contest. I need to survey the field.”

She leaned across the counter. It made an almost-private place for his words. “You’re serious.”

“Very.”

“You don’t look like…” She waved a hand in a way that might have been an apology.

“I know. But you don’t have to be a tank to eat pie fast. You have to have technique. You have to have heart.” He said it to make her laugh. It was only half a joke.

She bit her lip like she was trying to not smile, and failed. “Well, heart. Okay. Where is this happening?”

“Community arena. Thursday night. They do the qualis. Finals Sunday at the fairgrounds.”

“You’ll make it,” she said, as if it were as easy as paying rent. “You’ve got a look. Like—” She squinted again. “Like the guy nobody bets on. Not an insult. They will cry later when they see your secret ninja gut.”

“I will not tell my gut you said that. He’s sensitive,” Owen said. They traded the paper bag and a second joke and the impression of fourteen others unsaid. What a piece of fluff. What a relief.

That evening he jogged, badly, along the path that skirted the pond where ducks made meetings of huge importance and teenagers carved new names into old wood. He ran a lap, then another while a country song on someone’s radio did its job. There were rules in the event that took the fun out and gave the fun back: no water after the start, no hands, lean over the plate, chew enough not to obstruct, a judge-making faces at you if you tried to cheat with smear tactics. He had learned things from internet experts: chew in rhythm. Work the crust first. Fruit pies go easier than meat; meat clogs you up and turns your face the exact shade of regret. He tried breathing patterns while he ran. In through the nose. Out through the mouth. He felt stupid and no one noticed.

Thursday arrived like a dare.

His boss Darlene’s office was a glitch of plants and a stapler that had seen wars. She had a stack of time-off requests most of which looked like letters to the editor written by people who had very strong opinions. She had also a heart as surprising as it was matter-of-fact, if that made sense. “So,” she said. “You need Sunday off. Exchange shift or whatever.”

“If it’s okay.”

She peered at him. She had the kind of eyes that saw things you hadn’t learned yet. “It’s your fair. Go eat pie. Don’t come in here Monday with your face blue and ask me for hazard pay. But seriously. Have fun. You don’t take enough days.”

“I take a Saturday every week.”

“That’s… not how weeks work, Halvorsen.”

“Right.”

He left with a promise to text if he were detained by glory.

The community arena had fluorescent lights that made everyone look like the winter version of themselves. The echo of his steps reminded him of being ten and afraid of nothing except a ball coming at his nose. People gathered in small clusters among the folding chairs and the booths selling kettle corn and homemade jams decorated with gingham that no one had asked for and everyone expected. A sign said PIE EATING QUALIFIERS in letters that wanted more ink than the marker had left.

“Contestants check in here,” said a teenager with a bored professionalism he admired. His name tag said BRAYDEN with the Y underlined twice like an inside joke. He passed Owen a form that said he wouldn’t sue anyone if his esophagus made a decision on its own. Owen signed it with the flourish of someone who hadn’t signed anything interesting since the lease. His number was 11, which he decided he liked.

Beside him a mountain moved and it turned out to be a man. Red beard, shoulders like a couch, hands with muscle memory for lifting either weights or whole cows. He had a laugh like someone dropping a toolbox into another toolbox. “First time?” he asked and it sounded like he was asking how the weather was.

“Second,” Owen said. “Local one two summers ago. Charity thing. It was… organized.”

The big man gave a knowing nod. “Brick,” he said, by way of his name being Brick. “From down the road in Stony.”

“Owen,” he said. They shook. Brick’s hand was not for show. “You’ve done this before.”

“A few times,” Brick said. “And yet I keep coming back. You’d think a man would learn. You got any tricks?”

“Chew in threes,” Owen said, surprising himself.

“That’s cute,” Brick said, not mean. “My trick is don’t die.”

A small, birdlike older guy prowled past them in a blazer he couldn’t possibly afford, speaking into a walkie like it was the last walkie on earth. “Where’s my cranberry? Where’s my blueberry? Who stole my rhubarb? Team two is delayed, we’re delayed, we’re fine. Smile. Smile.” His expression suggested he had never smiled on purpose. He was a human who had lived most of his life next to a megaphone.

When they called number 11, Owen’s chest rattled. The stage was not a stage. It was a long table with six plates and six pies and a tarp on the floor that would later be folded into itself like false modesty. The judge, a man with a clipboard and a face that wanted to be somewhere else, explained the rules again. The crowd was not large but it made noise in the manner of a larger crowd. Some nights you get applause that forgives things you haven’t done yet. He tipped his baseball cap backward and stepped up to his plate.

Blueberry. He had hoped. It stained, but it went down in a willing manner.

“Hands behind your backs,” the judge said, cheerfully enough. “On three.”

He set his elbows on the table to anchor, shuffled his feet into fighter’s stance though he would never fight for any reason but to end a fight, and on three he went down like an old time boxer with a plan.

The pastry scratched his top palate. He did the tongue thing he had practiced, pushing crust parts to the side, slurping filling in small vacuums of sound, forming bites with his teeth that would not get him in trouble with his own throat. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t supposed to be. He found the rhythm in his jaw. He let the crowd be a blur and the judge’s whistle be a suggestion. He tilted his head and the pie followed, sliding like a hillside in the rain. He smiled into the tin, which surprised him; who smiles into a pie tin? He had to breathe; he breathed. He got crumbs in his nose and didn’t panic. He kept going even when the man at number 9 made a gagging sound that scared a mother in the front row. He kept going even when his brain told him this was ridiculous and he should be ashamed of himself and also more ashamed for believing this mattered. He kept going because—why stop? Because we stop so often for no good reason, and here was a reason to keep moving your mouth and your heart and then a slice later he was done.

He was done before number 9, more or less at the same breath as number 4. Brick at number 12 thumped the table with a hollow boom of completion and shooting stars of blueberry rose up like confetti. The judge called times in a bored voice that made the numbers more holy. Owen had not won the heat; that went to Brick by a tick and a half. He did not expect his legs to feel like kelp. They did.

Mira materialized at the edge of the stage like a fairy godmother if a godmother wore flour on her jeans. “I can’t believe that was you,” she said, and laughed and pressed a napkin at his chin. “Blue beard.”

“You came,” he said, which had been the hope he had stuffed into his sock.

“I closed early,” she said, not looking at him when she said it, because she was not sure how that would land in either of their chests. “It gets slow after six anyway. Also, my landlord is in that audience and I would like him to see me and remember I exist when I ask for the plumbing to be less enthusiastic.”

They called out names and numbers, and the man in the blazer turned his face into a cheer. “Advancing to Sunday,” he said, “we have our group one qualifiers: number 4… number 11… and number 12!”

The crowd clapped. Someone who didn’t know where to put their energy whooped. Owen’s name sounded strange under the arena lights, like when your own voice comes back from a canyon. He lifted a sticky hand and then lowered it quickly when he remembered where that hand had just been. The moment was larger in his head than it looked in the air, but it existed, and he put it in his pocket, safe.

Backstage, which was only a curtain hanging a little crooked, Brick whistled low. “You’re dangerous,” he said.

“I’m decent,” Owen said.

“You moved like you had a plan. That’s rare, around here. Mostly it’s dudes with hubris and dental insurance. Sunday will be a field, though. People come out of the woods for finals. You ever met Cannon?”

“No.”

“You’ll know him when you see him. He’s the one with the fan club. And the foam finger his girlfriend made that says ‘Chomp.’ Ridiculous. You hungry?”

“I just ate.”

“That is not food,” Brick said. “That is performance art and regret tomorrow morning.”

They laughed. It wasn’t friendship, not yet, but it was league membership. Mira waited by the exit, the late June evening dragging stripes of peach and lavender across the horizon like a painter who got lost in the color section.

“You were good,” she said. “Good-good. Not just for a guy from here. Good.”

“Thank you.” He wiped his face again. Blue persisted in crevices he had not known he owned. “There were some older ladies in front who weren’t quite sure what they were applauding for.”

“They came for the quilt raffle and stayed for the bloodsport,” Mira said. “Your input?”

“I’ll bring them muffins to apologize,” he said, and then felt at once like he was joking and not. “Sunday. You’ll be there?”

“If the pipes behave,” she said, and made a face. “Anyway, congrats. Your fan club can’t afford foam fingers, but—” She lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in the air, shaking them like seaweed in a current. “Jazz hands.”

He got home to his apartment that smelled like garlic no matter what he did. His neighbor in 301 had invented a new way to burn toast. He showered in water that couldn’t decide if it wanted to scald or sulk. He called his father, because some things held you up by their mere existence, and said, “I got into the finals,” and his father said, “Of what,” and then “Oh,” in that careful neutral that meant he was deciding whether this was one of those calls where he should pretend to be thrilled or where he could breathe and be honest. Owen helped him by keeping it simple.

“I’ll come,” his father said. “I’ll clap. And I’ll tell you it isn’t food. But I’ll clap.”

“I know,” Owen said. “I know it isn’t… anything big. It’s the principle.”

“Most of life is principle,” his father said and laughed. “That and keeping your receipts. Drink water. I don’t understand why, but I think it’s important.”

He went to bed early and didn’t sleep because the nervous little animal that lives beneath a man’s ribs needed to run. He dreamed the dumb dream where you’re on stage and you realize you’ve forgotten to put on pants and the stage is a pie crust. He woke laughing and then sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands and let the laugh turn into something like a prayer.

Friday crawled. Saturday he did not train because he listened to a video online that told him rest is training too and he let that be true. He ate something green and something white and something brown and wished for a diagram that told him in percentages what each thing did once it got in there. He cleaned a dentist’s office after hours and felt a weird surge of solidarity with the tools lined up like silver toys. He told Inez, who told him good luck as if he were leaving to sail around the world on a canoe.

Sunday he wore his shirt with the least suspicious stain. He laced his shoes like he’d be asked to run. The fairgrounds had grown a fair since Thursday. Tents blossomed; the air had a growl to it, generators working. The scent of onion and sugar and dust was old-school and undeniable. The stage for the finals was an actual stage, with an actual banner that did not blow off in the first breeze. The emcee was the blazer man who had found a second blazer. He held his mic like an extension of his nervous system.

“Ladies and gentlemen, and anyone and everyone in between or beyond, welcome to the Spruce Grove Summer Days Pie Eating Finals!” he yodeled. “Get your stomachs right and your hands off these pies. The rules are posted. The pies are partly forgiving. The judges are fair. The cleanup crew is—brave.”

Owen met the other finalists behind the stage where a volunteer gave them small bottles of water and said, “Not after you hit the plate,” in a tone that suggested she had lost at least one wet sneaker to a man who forgot. Cannon introduced himself simply by existing, a blonde block of a man with a smile he’d practiced in the mirror. His girlfriend did indeed have a foam finger. It did indeed say CHOMP. Brick rolled his eyes so hard it was audible. “Don’t let them get in your head,” he said, not exactly quiet.

“They make shirts,” Cannon said, overhearing without taking offense. “If they make shirts you can sell them online, and then my boss gets off my case about hours.”

“That’s a business plan,” Brick said. “I respect it, I do.”

“Which is more than your gut will respect you after this,” Cannon said and thumped Brick on his back in a gesture that almost knocked him into next week.

Mira found Owen as a volunteer tied a bib around his neck, a ridiculous accessory that did exactly what it was supposed to do. “Break a leg,” she said, and then her face went thoughtful. “Not that. Break… a record. Break a… pie. Don’t break anything.”

“I’ll be fine.”

He was not sure. He was.

The first pie was saskatoon berry. It crumbled differently than blueberry, a skitter of seeds he didn’t hate. The second pie was apple, which had that baked bite that required more chewing and thus more precision than a man wanted in such a situation. The third was—pecan? He raised his head, and the judge’s eyebrow did a thing that said, Be grateful, son. He readjusted his strategy mid-chew, which is a ridiculous sentence and also exactly what he did.

Brick was steady, Cannon was fast. Owen found that his rhythm from Thursday came back like a song you liked too much to forget. He could see nothing but his plate, and in his peripheral the toe of someone’s shoe that had a hole in it, and beyond that something like the roof of the world. It was absurd and he recognized that in real time. It was also as real as anything. He leaned, he chomped, he breathed. He thought of his father’s small smile, Mira’s jazz hands, Inez and her knitted goat sweater. He thought of his mother adjusting a table runner, because she would, and telling him not to be ridiculous but making sure the sun fell on his plate just so.

He made it through the second pie in good standing. He had time. He was going to possibly—he didn’t let his head go there. Focus is a room with no windows.

Halfway through the third, his mouth did something he didn’t ask it to do, a small gag sound like an uninvited violin in a punk band. He breathed through. He saw the judge notch something on his clipboard that might have been a judge version of a prayer. He dug in again, slower, and Brick came level and then past him by a half-lap around the tin. Cannon had jam all over his nose and joy all over his face. The crowd made a noise like a collective knee being knocked against a table.

He did not win. He did not come second. He came third, and the emcee threw his arm around Cannon and declared him a legend, and confetti made of paper and regret fell, and someone in the front row clapped with two hands and a foot, and it was all more than and less than he had imagined it might be.

Owen did not mind. Or he minded in a way that did not damage his day. He wiped his face and looked for Mira because that was what his eyes wanted. She was there, half-smile in place, her eyes a little warmer than the air. Brick shook his hand and squeezed. “You’ll get them next year,” he said, which was a kindness and also a way to say what else are we doing but coming back to try again with a different shirt.

“Nice work,” Cannon said, and meant it. “Your chew in threes? I saw that. I like a method man.”

He laughed and let the laugh stay. The emcee handed out ribbons and the trophy to Cannon, who kissed it like it had a mouth. People milled. The generator whined. The sun did what it does in June and refused to go to bed on time. Owen took his participation certificate and folded it into quarters that were ungently neat and then remembered he was supposed to wear his ribbon for the photos and tried to untangle it like he was in a romantic comedy with a shoelace.

It came to him with the force of a clear sky that he was okay. That’s a stupid sentence, and so what.

He sat on the edge of a hay bale that was exactly wrong for sitting and chewed his lip and thought what a deliciously odd path this was, from a bucket and a mop to here with blueberry under his nails and a small soft light in his chest. He thought of calling his father and saying third, old man, your boy got a bronze in something your wife would have laughed all morning about. He thought he’d text Inez a picture of his blue stained grin. He thought he’d take Mira out for ice cream and talk about anything else.

“Is it crass to sell pies here?” Mira asked, dropping down beside him, two spoons and one dish in her hand like a dare and a gift.

“It’s exactly right,” he said, and took a bite and winced when cold stabbed his forehead and then he laughed at himself for being the person who can eat three pies in ten minutes and loses his mind over a single lick of ice cream.

“Here’s to dignity,” she said.

“And to losing it,” he said.

They clinked their plastic spoons like wine glasses and when the emcee shouted into his mic about a lost child named Lucas who was not lost anymore, the crowd applauded as if Lucas had conquered a mountain. Maybe he had. Maybe finding your mother in a crowd when everything is taller than you is a kind of Everest. Owen’s phone buzzed and his father’s text read, Simply—saw you on the livestream, your aunt sent the link. Proud. You looked like your grandfather. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and blamed the wind.

On the walk back to his car, he passed the cotton candy machine spinning sugar into clouds and the tired men at the ring toss resetting rings like sins forgiven. He passed a poster for a community theater production and another for a blood drive. Life intersected with itself and made a pattern that did not make sense up close, only stepping back. He could already feel tomorrow’s stiffness. He could already feel the need, gentle but present, to return to mops and glass and the corners you miss when your head is somewhere else. There was relief in that. There was the comfort of a list.

“Hey, Halvorsen,” someone called, and he turned and Brick jogged up, every step heavy and solid, like a promise that didn’t break. “Some guys are doing a charity thing next month. Perogies this time. You in?”

“Perogies?” He let the word sit on his tongue like a prayer bead.

“Perogies,” Brick confirmed. “Different skill set, same thrill. Think about it.”

“I’ll think,” he said, and he meant it in both the way people say I’ll think when they’re politely bailing and the way some decisions sit in the pocket for weeks before you realize you said yes in your sleep.

When he got home, he set the ribbon on the table and then moved it to the top of the fridge because the table needed to be for eating and the ribbon needed to be for something else, undefined. He showered blue away until his skin was mostly his again. He slept as if he had been running. Monday the building would greet him with its ordinary shine and its not-shine, and he would be there with the itch under his skin that the fair had started. He would move. He would mop. He would hum. He would think of Mira’s hands making the littlest circles with pastry and of his father making tea too strong and of we—whoever we were—being okay.

And because the world creeps in on soft feet even when you shut the door, a text pinged from a number not in his phone. Nice work out there today, it read. Shame if something, say, unexpected messed up the next big thing. He blinked. The text had no name. The number was a scramble. He considered that this was a joke from Brick or Cannon or some kid who wanted to see what happens when you poke a guy who likes pie. He considered ignoring it. He did. He put the phone face down and listened to the neighbor’s television leak life through the wall. A show where people chased houses, a show where people cooked. He laughed in his chest and then out loud and then quieted. He could feel the fair still on his skin, like glitter you never entirely get rid of.

Inez would tell him he was being dramatic when he told her the story later, probably Wednesday because Tuesday had its own personality. Mira would roll her eyes like a kind of yes. His father would say, what did the text actually say, and he would read it to him and hear the silence that means you’ve stepped into a plot someone else thinks is theirs. He told himself people play jokes. He told himself this wasn’t a story. The ribbon on the fridge made a small shadow on the wall like a flag in wind. He fell asleep with the scent of flour in his hair and the taste of sugar at the back of his tongue, and the city outside turned down its volume, and somewhere else in town someone was stirring a pot with more intent than flavour.Chapter 2

Monday always put on its clothes slowly, like it wasn’t entirely sold on the idea. The sky leaned toward ordinary blue, and the truck behind the municipal building was already gone, leaving behind a seam of damp on the asphalt where its shadow had been. The lights clicked awake in sequence and the hum layered up until the building sounded like a polite hive. Owen let himself in and the keys did their whispering work. He liked that sound. It said you belong here in the practical sense even if everything else about belonging is less certain, and it said this is a job you can finish if you keep at it, which is not nothing on a day where you need a sentence like that to prop you up.

The pink notes on the board were fresh, Inez’s tidy print a balm and a prod. Chair leg scuffs. Someone tracked mulch through the northeast hallway, why. A doodle of a cat, because she couldn’t help herself. He cracked his knuckles like a man about to play the piano and rolled his bucket to the tap. The water went cloudy the way it always did at first and then cleared as if it had remembered itself. He tipped in the measured slosh of soap and the air shifted toward citrus and chemical righteousness. He thought of the text and told himself not to think of the text. He thought of the ribbon on his fridge, a little flag that had no country to fly for. He thought of pie in a way that made his stomach tilt, the way your stomach reminds you it is a creature with a personality.

It’s a prank, he told himself as he pressed the mop to tile and taught the tile to shine again. It’s a kid with a fake number and time on their hands. It is not a plot. This is a town where plots involve garden beds and the occasional fundraiser. He heard his own voice in his head and knew he sounded like a man trying to be reasonable in front of an unreasonable feeling. He put the feeling under his heel with the dirt and pushed.

By the time Inez arrived, cardigan buttoned wrong and then corrected, the building felt like a routine you could set your watch by. She had a tote bag with a cartoon goat on it and the words You’ve Goat To Be Kidding Me, which she claimed she had not bought for herself and was a lie no court would uphold.

“You look like someone hit you with a bag of sleep and missed,” she said, handing him a wrapped muffin the size of a hockey puck.

“That’s very specific,” he said. “And accurate.”

“You’ll accept a kindness in the morning and then get philosophical on my lunch break,” she said. “That’s our deal. How was your circus yesterday? I watched a live stream until my internet remembered it lives in a basement apartment under a freeway and a thunderstorm.”

“Third,” he said. “Bronze in blueberry.”

“Third? I would have bet you fourth,” she said, and when he cocked an eyebrow she patted his hand. “That’s my way of making third sound better than expected so you don’t feel the need to punch a locker. Proud of you, hanger. You did the thing.”

“Thanks,” he said, and the thanks had weight. He put the ridiculous muffin in the pocket of his jacket because he would forget it otherwise and find it in November.

He told her about the text because not telling her felt like holding your breath for no reason. The words came out more dramatic than they had sounded in his head, as if saying a thing always makes it grow a little. Her face didn’t do alarm, not at first. It did the calculation of a person whose life has introduced them to a handful of stupid human behaviors and taught them not to jump at shadows but also not to ignore a shape in the dark with a hat on.

“Show me,” she said, reaching for his phone with the casual authority of a nurse. He handed it over and she read the message twice as if it might rearrange on the second pass. “Kids, mostly. Sometimes adults being kids. Could be one of your new… professional acquaintances. The big one with the name like a construction material. What is it. Brick. He seems kind, though. The blonde one seemed like a handshake you don’t want.”

“Cannon,” he said. “He wasn’t… He was fine. His girlfriend wears foam, but he was fine.”

She nodded, satisfied with her personal taxonomy of men. “Still. Save the number. If they send another thing, we go to a person with a badge. Not because I think it’s serious, but because I slept less last night than I will ever admit to another soul and it made me unkind in my head. It’s always fine until it isn’t and then you wish you told someone before. And because I like saying to people with badges, here is my evidence.”

“I can call Dad and tell him I’ve collected evidence,” he said, half a joke, half a practice run for later.

“He’ll make tea too strong and tell you to get a dog,” she said. “You don’t need a dog. You need new socks and a vacation and for the city to replace that mop head more than once a season. Run along. Go make the glass a hymn.”

He hummed while he did it, because the building demanded hums like some people demand background music to decide how to feel. Outside the morning arranged itself into its usual parade. Men in neon vests stacked orange cones. Women with lanyards clutched coffee and purpose. A boy on a bike streaked a line between cars like a comet that refused to learn. The text sat in his pocket like a coin he wasn’t using because he didn’t know if it was lucky or a trick.

At ten he ate the muffin because he had to honor the covenant of a gifted baked good and because if he did not, Inez would quiz him later like a mother hen with a degree in interrogation. It was bran with cranberries that pretended they were cherries when they wanted to impress you. He texted his father a photo of the ribbon against his fridge door and wrote Third. The reply came five minutes later, as if his father had needed to stare at the picture and make a decision about jokes. A man came third in 1956 and is still mentioned in the family storybook, his father wrote. That man caught a fish, but pie is more elusive. Proud of you. Keep receipts. He laughed out loud and scared a squirrel on the window ledge into having a moral crisis.

After his shift, he headed toward the Blue Spruce because a habit is a road you like, and also because some days you need to stand in a smell that remembers that life is not just work. The bakery window was fogged around the edges as if the place were thinking hard. A handwritten sign that was not usually there hung cockeyed on the glass: Closed for an hour—plumbing tantrum. He put his hand to the cool pane because he had the childish superstition that you can comfort a building through its windows. It made no sense and felt right.

He knocked gently with a knuckle as if that were somehow different than knocking with a fist, and Mira appeared from the back like a woman pulling herself through molasses. Her face was a storm you could see the sun behind. She let him in with a gesture and a sigh that had tiny knives in it.

“If you tell me you’re good with wrenches, I will marry you out of gratitude and then we can get divorced after the pipes behave,” she said, half in jest and half in a low-dosage plea.

“I can mop with the best of them and I can Google with the rest of them,” he said. “What’s up?”

She took him to the back where the world was a chaos of flour ghosts and wet footprints. Someone had shut the water off, then on, then off again. The floor was a small lake with islands of stainless steel table legs and a population of guilty-looking towels. The sink had a look of innocence that sinks practice when they’ve done something without meaning to. He squatted to look under it the way a man does when he has no real plan and found the shutoff valve slick with something that was not water. He touched it with the tip of a finger because the part of his brain that says don’t touch glistening things was on break, and he lifted his finger to his nose. It had a smell he knew: a whisper of WD-40, garage-flavored and smug.

“Did you oil your valve for fun this morning?” he asked, and when she frowned he said, “It’s slippery. Like someone greased it. Makes it easier to turn, I guess, or harder if you have wet hands and a temper.”

She looked at him the way people look at a puzzle piece that fits too neatly. “Why would anyone… Why.”

“Maintenance? Gremlins? A landlord trying to be helpful? A teenager with a can and a YouTube education?” he said, listing the spectrum because listing is a way to keep panic from building room additions.

“Landlord can’t be bothered to put felt pads on the bottoms of stools,” she said. “Teenager, maybe. Gremlins would have left me a note. This was on when I left last night. I am almost positive. And this morning it was off and in the middle of mixing the fourth batch for a guy who needs three hundred mini tarts like today is the royal wedding, it went on and then it didn’t want to be off and then—” She waved at the floor like she was introducing a guest on a talk show.

“Do you want to call anyone?” he asked. “Besides me, which does your heart credit but might be unwise statistically.”

“I called the plumber, he is in Devon until three and then he will be in a mood,” she said. “I turned off what I could turn off. The main is in the basement that belongs to the pizza place and the pizza guy is in Fort Saskatchewan visiting a mother who cannot be reached. I am living in a sitcom episode with B-plots and a laugh track. Can you—could you—just hold this flashlight while I convince this pipe to choose a personality.”

He stayed two hours, squeegeeing water toward a drain that did not know the meaning of hurry, ferrying trays to higher ground like pies were refugees, holding a light while she did something that involved plumber’s tape and a prayer she did not say aloud. They found a small note under the back door, folded once, that had blown itself into a puddle and disintegrated into a sullen rectangle. It had been a receipt, probably, for flour or coffee or something with tax on it. It turned into paper stew in his hand and he stood there with pulp and an expression that he would have laughed at if he could see himself.

“You got a text,” he said, when there was a lull and the floor looked like it might forgive them. He said it in the way you mention weather with a subtext. “Last night. From a number that didn’t sign itself. Said something about the next big thing being a shame if something messed it up. I ignored it because that was the choice that kept me from feeling like a drama queen. Now your sink is a hobby.”

She straightened and leaned her shoulder against the cool stainless and closed her eyes in a way that wasn’t fatigue but a recalibration. “You think that has anything to do with this. That’s a leap with good sneakers.”

“I think I am not at my most rational in the hour after a flood,” he said. “And I think I am doing that thing where coincidences turn into conspiracies because feelings want company.”

“I got one the other day,” she said, and then laughed like the laughter surprised her. “A text. Not exactly like that. More like: Open late this week and see what happens to your nice ranking on the local mom group. Which is weird because I have never asked the local mom group to rank anything. I thought it was an ex-coworker being petty. Or a competitor thinking I was coming for their wedding cake game, which I am not, because brides scare me. People get weird around the concept of fondant.”

“That’s two texts,” he said. “Which is not a hundred. But is two.”

“It could be the same weirdo,” she said. “It could be two separate weirdos, which would be statistically fascinating and also make me want to lie face-down on the flour sack and wait for a century.”

He was quiet because the room needed a space that wasn’t words. The drain finally decided it could be a hero, just for a bit, and the lake receded into a respectful puddle. The air took that post-rain smell that feels like a signed apology. He set his squeegee against the wall and wiped his hands on his jeans and looked at the back door again. The lock was the cheap kind you buy in a hardware aisle while grabbing batteries, and the jamb had a scuff at shoulder height where you might bump it if your hands were full. He touched the scuff and it flaked under his finger, one of those paints that never truly bond. He could have made a case for anything and so he did not make a case.

“Okay,” he said. “Idea. You keep your phone on you in your apron like you do. If anyone sends another love letter, we take it to someone whose job is reading love letters that are less loving. Inez will murder me if I let a plot twist happen without telling her. Also, I can bring you a nicer squeegee.”

“A nicer squeegee,” she said with a straight face. “You know how to woo a lady.”

“I woo with squeegees and sandwiches stolen from the break room,” he said. “Also, I can sit with the door if you want to grab a shower. You smell like determination. It’s a good smell. It is also flour-based.”

She made a face that held gratitude and mortification in equal measures and went to wash the streaks of the morning off her forearms while he stood in the back with his hands in his pockets and listened. He could hear the bakery front bell chime without customers as if remembering how. The fan over the oven turned its steady circles, sounding like someone deep breathing their way through a mild panic. A kid skateboarded by outside with that clack that makes a whole day sound teenage. He stayed until the plumber arrived and proclaimed all pipes to be mysteries he had learned not to trust and charged a fee that looked like a number you could divide by three pies. When the plumber left, satisfied that nothing would burst while he was twenty minutes away, Mira slid Owen a paper bag with something heavy in it and a look like, let me give this and you don’t argue.

“I’m paying you in tarts,” she said. “It is medieval. It is what I have.”

“I was here because… I wanted to be,” he said, and heard how that could be read in ten directions. “And because your sink attempted a coup. And because I know how to hold a flashlight.”

“Eat the tarts,” she said. “Even if you think you never want sugar again, which is adorable. And if you get another thing, you tell me. I will bring my rolling pin and my meanest customer service voice.”

They stood in the doorway for a minute like a pair of cats who had concluded a treaty. He thought he should tell her she was the kind of person other people send weird texts to because she makes a place people want to be, and some people who cannot make a place get large feelings about those who can. He did not say that because today did not need more words with teeth. They settled for a nod that felt like a plan.

That evening Darlene called as he was lacing his shoes for no reason except that laces on shoes feel like control. “You got room in you for a last-minute? Community center’s begging. The mayor’s thing is tomorrow—breakfast with muffins and people wearing polite faces. They want a sweep tonight because some… youth with a can tasted the thrill of aerosol art. It’s not a mess-mess, but it’s a mess to someone important. I’ll throw it to you with a little hazard bonus if you say yes. If you say no, I will throw it to Joel and then we will all live with Joel’s version of sanitized.”

“I can, yeah,” he said. “What time?”

“In an hour,” she said. “And wear your be-seen vest. They want you to be a presence. Ridiculous. As if scrubbing in a vest deters teenagers. Take your keys. Have a good time.”

The community center had a distinct echo, less jovial than the arena, more municipal. Its halls smelled faintly of chlorine because proximity to the pool makes whole buildings go aquatic in character. He found the spot in the back corridor where someone had sprayed their practice tag, a looping name that could have been BOLT or BOAT or BOZO depending on your faith in curves. The paint was fresh and arrogant. He put on a mask because a man who has spent years breathing ammonia and regret learns to protect what he wants to keep, and he went to work with solvent and rag and patience. The loop softened and bled and then broke, and underneath a ghost version of the letter stuck around like a memory that won’t quite leave a family.

A man in a blue blazer—maybe the same blazer, maybe the blazer had multiplied—appeared at his shoulder and made a noise like a sigh that wanted attention. “Vernon,” he said by way of name, as if introducing himself to a microphone. “Event coordinator. You’re… the guy with the mop from the other thing.”

“Owen,” he said. He scrubbed and did not give the man the full theater of eye contact because paint does not wait for social niceties. “What’s the other thing.”

“The pie nonsense,” Vernon said, and smiled in a way that said he didn’t entirely mean nonsense but the word had gotten stuck on his tongue. “You had a… presence. Thank you for performing for the city. Speaking of performance. We’ve had some mischief. Nothing criminal, I am told, by people who do not understand that this is my reputation we’re discussing. Extension cords go missing like socks in a dryer. A banner unfurls to say WELCO E with no M because someone decided the M could have a private life. Bleach in the mop bucket and then suddenly there is bleach on my hands for the rest of the day, why. Things that make me look like I don’t have hands on things. And then today this, which is just—” He gestured at the wall as if the paint had insulted his mother.

“Did you put a better lock on your storage,” Owen said, not accusing, but asking like a man whose life has taught him you get what you lock.

“Ha!” Vernon said. “Budget. This place runs on ten kinds of earnest and two kinds of tape. But yes. We are upgrading. We are generations deep in padlocks. It’ll be fine. If you see anyone with a can or a conspiratorial hat, tell me. You have the look of a man who sees things.”

He did not say that seeing the things other people don’t want to see is the job description of a janitor. He did not say that his job had trained him to hear the sound of a spill two rooms away and know its viscosity by the way it hit tile. He said he would keep an eye out, and he meant it.

He finished, left the wall a little cleaner than it had been and also a little bruised, the way surfaces always are after being corrected. On his way out, he ran into Brick in the lobby reading a bulletin board like it was a philosophical text. Brick wore a T-shirt advertising a barbecue that had happened last September and a pair of shorts that could have been a boat in a pinch.

“You’re everywhere a man could be that sells tickets,” Brick said. “You cleaning this place too? You are going to live to ninety with the lungs of a bassoon.”

“Somebody painted a word that wanted to be BOLT,” he said. “Vernon is having a day.”

“Vernon lives in a permanent day,” Brick said. “He dates drama like it’s good for his skin. You get any weird messages yet or was that wishful thinking on his part. He told me someone keeps moving his cones so the safety pathway looks like a cat designed it. He thinks it’s personal. I told him sometimes the wind makes choices.”

He told Brick about the text because he was curious what the man would do with it. Brick scratched at his beard and made a noise that said he was reserving judgment but offering sympathy.

“People get odd when they see someone take a bite out of any kind of stage,” Brick said. “Not just pies. I got a lady in Drayton Valley who sends me scripture about gluttony every time I put my name on a sign-up sheet for charity. I tell her I’m raising money for the library and she tells me libraries are dens of iniquity because they lend out romance novels. We live in a time. If someone says, do this or I’ll do a drama, you go to a grown-up and tell them. Cops. Venue. Your dad if he carries a large wrench. Don’t invite the game onto your porch and then complain when the raccoon opens your garbage.”

“Good advice,” he said. “Did you just call me a garbage can.”

“I called all of us a garbage can,” Brick said, with the ease of a man comfortable with metaphor. “We hold things for the world, they overflow, and then we get a raccoon. Cannon would tell you to film the texts for content and monetize your anxiety. He’s not entirely wrong. Hey, perogies. Think about it.”

“I’m thinking,” Owen said. “Between now and when I’m eighty.”

He drove home with the smell of solvent on his hands in a ghost way that all the soap in the world never fully fixes. His father called on schedule and the conversation did its dance, weather, the fact that a cousin’s second child had decided to be a bassoonist, money that behaves like a cat that only likes you when you’re not looking, and then the text because Owen owed him the truth and himself the relief of saying it out loud to a voice that had steadied him since he stood on a chair to reach the tap.

“It said what, exactly,” his father said, and Owen read it to him in the bald form of things. “I would be tempted to call Constable Lowe and say, here is a thing, and brush your teeth, and then go on with your day. He will tell you it is probably a teenager. He will write it down in a notebook that smells like institutional coffee and he will tell you to keep him posted. It is not nothing and it is not an emergency unless it becomes one, and then you will wish you had a notebook entry somewhere with your name and the word told. Bring Mira a better lock for that back door. I will pay you back if you need me to feel involved.”

“I don’t need you to feel involved,” he said, and smiled to hear his own teenage voice in there somewhere. “But I accept the lock as a family project.”

“Done,” his father said. “Don’t go inventing enemies because your life tried on a stage for a weekend. But don’t let someone else decide to make you part of theirs. Be careful. Eat a vegetable.”

“I ate a bran muffin.”

“That doesn’t count,” his father said. “But it tries. Good night.”

He slept like a person in a train that doesn’t stop in his town, half aware of motion and the occasional station name called out in a voice he couldn’t parse. He woke to Tuesday trying to be a joke about Mondays and failing. The mayor’s breakfast had a tablecloth piety to it, and the building wanted to stand a little straighter. He did the extra pass over the corridor where dignitaries would glide, and he collected his bucket with the feeling that you get when you look under the couch and find both a penny and a receipt for something you had meant to return.

On the way past the front desk, he saw a new note in someone’s hurried hand: Remember: media at ten. Be kind. Be brief. There was a drawing of a microphone with rays around it the way kids draw the sun, as if sound were a warm thing. He straightened the stack of pamphlets and made the chairs stand like a platoon. He did not know why he felt protective, but he did.

The first text of the day came at nine-twenty, when the room was a soft uproar of muffins and introductions. Nice work on the scrub job, it said. You’re good at making things look like nothing happened. Do you want to keep being good at that, or do you want to see what happens when no one cleans up messes. He swallowed because it seemed the appropriate response and because his throat had gone dry. He took a screenshot with a hand that tried to be steady. He looked around at faces and saw none turned toward him with wickedness painted on. The thing about fear is it convinces you everyone is an actor in your play.

He walked the long way to the back office where Inez was pretending to answer phones that had not rung yet. She listened to the new message with her head tilted like a bird. She did not swear, because she had a vow about that, but she said, “Oh, for the love of thread,” which was her version. She marched him to Darlene, who put on her boss face and then her human face and then picked up the phone with a sigh like a woman making bread. “Constable Lowe,” she said when someone on the other end answered. “Do you have a minute for nothing-too-drastic but not-nothing.”

They sat in a small room that smelled of toner and listened to a man with kind eyes and end-of-shift energy say the things his father had predicted. He wrote in a notebook that had coffee scars on the cardboard, and he nodded in the rhythm of a man who knows when nodding is part of the medicine. “Keep the messages,” he said. “Don’t write back. Tell us if it escalates. Are you going to any events where a mess would truly be exciting. What’s your access to buildings not your own.” Owen told him about keys and about the community center call. Lowe’s eyes did a flicker that meant he’d add a note that said janitor with keys, which in some small percentage of cases turns into a plot point and in most cases turns into a line in a file that gets dusty.

“Do you think this is about the Saturday event, the pancake thing,” Darlene asked, because even people who say they’re not nervous ask about specific mornings.

“We’ve had a run of silly,” Lowe said. “Someone threw a stink bomb under the bleachers at a high school ball game and a kid tripped over an extension cord that wasn’t where it had been a minute before. Someone switched signs outside the petting zoo so the goats ended up in the chickens and the adults found it more upsetting than the animals. We are not exactly in the throes of criminal masterminds. But it’s summer. Mischief wakes up when the lilacs do. If anyone tells you to do a thing or else, come see me before you do it. If they do a thing, call 911 instead of me. People don’t realize they’re allowed to call 911 for things that are not blood, but you are. And—use your eyes. You have eyes.”

He left the small room with a photocopied page that said How To Report and a feeling like he had done something adult even if that something involved telling someone about texts like a teenager reporting a prank. He sent Mira a message that said, Told a cop. She sent back a gif of a cartoon rolling pin flexing a cartoon bicep.

The mayor’s breakfast came and went. A man with a voice like a radio station no one listens to spoke for seven minutes about community spirit and fiscal prudence. The muffins were better than the muffins usually are when they are procured by the city. Someone dropped a blueberry on a shoe and someone else tried to be helpful and ground it in with their heel in an act of kindness that left a galaxy where a solar system had been. Owen cleaned it without making it a production and the woman with the blueberry toe said thank you in a way that had a little relief in it, and he filed the thank you away with the ribbon on top of the fridge in the cabinet labeled This Is Why.

After lunch he walked to the hardware store and bought a lock that would not stop a determined thief but would slow down an ambitious raccoon. He liked that the packaging promised more than it could deliver with the sincerity of a newscaster. He brought it to Mira and installed it with his gentle tools while she watched and critiqued his screwdriving technique the way a woman watching you knead bread criticizes the way your wrists forget they’re attached to a living thing. She paid him in a loaf of something with seeds like stars. “You can decline if it offends you,” she said, and he shrugged and put the loaf under his arm like a newspaper.

In the late afternoon the second text of the day arrived while he was on his couch doing the thing where you sit but do not rest. It said, The next big thing is not muffins. The next big thing is Sunday’s fireworks. Shame, right, if all those families with blankets saw smoke where they didn’t want it. He stared for a count of seven because he had decided seven is how long you pause when deciding whether to panic. He forwarded it to Lowe and to Darlene and to himself, because he wanted a copy that didn’t exist only in the air. He did not write back. He did not call his father immediately because his father would tell him to call someone else first. He called Vernon, because if there was a man in town who wore a blazer to bed in case of event emergencies, it was Vernon.

“Fireworks,” he said, and Vernon made a noise like a peacock discovering a snake.

“Oh,” Vernon said. “Oh, no. I have had a day. Now I have a week. Thank you. Do not worry. I live to worry for you. That is my function.”

“Maybe… lock something,” he said, which was useless advice and both of them knew it.

“Fireworks are already in a truck in a place that is not a place because we do not say where the fireworks live,” Vernon said, with unhelpful theatricality. “We will be on them. Your job is to continue making things invisible. Mine is to shake like a Chihuahua while still appearing smooth. If you see a man with a match, grab him. Metaphorically. Probably. I will call Lowe. I have his number more memorized than my own.”

He set down the phone and looked at his room like it might answer a question. The ribbon on the fridge caught a slant of light and turned it into a beam that cut across the table where he ate and wrote and sometimes fell asleep on his arms. He walked over and stood very still and then took it down and moved it to the side of the fridge, where it would not be in the sun. He told himself it was because the red would fade. He told himself it was not because he did not want something bright to be a target in a room that suddenly felt like something could throw.

Because distraction is both enemy and friend, he went for a run. It was more of a shuffle, a cow in a hurry, but it put breath in his lungs in a way that made room in his head. He ran past the pond because he always did, and the ducks argued in their parliament of weeds. A couple sat on a bench with their shoulders touching as if they could give each other posture. He thought of the fireworks and the blanket families and the smell of sulphur that somehow makes memory more sticky. He thought of a person with intent to stir a pot and how that person might have a story that made them think they were the hero. He thought of the way small towns can cradle and suffocate in the same gesture.

At the end of the loop, he saw a kid hunched over the base of a lamppost with a can in their hand. He slowed because if life is going to deliver you clichés you can at least walk up to them with your eyes open. The kid was Brayden, the teenager with the underlined Y, his hair flopped over one eye in an arrangement that did not happen by accident. He started when he saw Owen and then tried to look casual with a technique that would not have fooled a blind librarian.

“Hey,” Owen said. “Art?”

“Sticker,” Brayden said, and held up a small circle that said SG YOUTH in a font that wanted to be rebellious when it grew up. “We’re supposed to put them on the skatepark bulletin board. The lamppost was me deciding the lamppost deserved a sticker. I am removing it because a woman with a small dog that looks like a croissant told me to get a job.”

“Jobs are overrated when you already have to be a student,” he said. “Hey. Weird question. You know anyone who thinks texts are a sport.”

Brayden looked like someone had asked him to parse poetry. “Texts are a sport,” he said. “What kind.”

“The kind where you send them to strangers and try to make their Tuesday interesting,” Owen said gently.

“Oh,” Brayden said, and genuinely thought about it. “Like that thing where you send your friends a picture of a lawn chair and say, this is your future. My cousin did that until his mom took his phone and then he went outside and it was wild. I don’t know. People are weird. If anybody’s doing that I will flame them on our group chat. Is it about the fireworks. There’s a rumor the fireworks got stolen last year but then they weren’t stolen they were just late because a guy took the wrong exit in Nisku and had a panic attack.”

“I don’t know what it is,” he said, which was honest in a way that left space to breathe. “If anyone brags about pranks more than they should, send them that choosing-to-be-kind meme with the raccoon.”

“I like that raccoon,” Brayden said, and peeled the sticker with the delicacy of a surgeon. “Adults are so scary about fireworks. It’s like the sky will get mad if we don’t do it right.”

He went home with the odd feeling that teenagers sometimes hold more of a town’s future than the people who imagine they do. He toasted a slice of seed bread and burned it because he forgot he was making toast and this is a good time to remember that humans are distractible and therefore endearing. He scraped the char into the sink and watched it settle like the end of a snow globe. He answered a text from Inez that said, Update me or I will assume you’re dead, and he told her about Lowe and Vernon and the fireworks and Brayden and the raccoon. She replied with eight goat emojis she had gone out of her way to find.

Close to midnight, his phone lit the dark like a tiny lighthouse. The message said, Good. Tell your new friends with notebooks to keep watch. It would still be a shame if something slipped under the fence. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling where the lights of cars outside occasionally made a river. He could feel the shape of his keys in his pocket even though they hung on their hook, and he could feel the city’s breath in his bones. He did not answer. He did not sleep easily. It was a waiting kind of night.

By Wednesday morning the town had gotten wind because towns are lungs and news is oxygen. In the coffee line a man in a camo hat opined about kids these days and a woman in leggings said it was probably adults because kids don’t coordinate that well and the barista said fireworks are dumb unless you’re five or a dog, and Mira when he stopped by told him the plumber had found an excuse to swing by again because the valve needed a talking-to, which is plumber for a bill. She wore her hair in a braid that meant business. There was a small pile of locks on the counter like a display at a hardware-themed bridal shower.

“You get any sleep,” she asked, and he told her he had gotten the variety where you dream you’re late for a test in a subject no one has heard of. “Me too,” she said. “I dreamed my oven had hands and threw my tray of croissants on the floor and then apologized in French.”

“I talked to a teenager and he was almost reassuring,” he said. “Which I did not expect. Lowe says tell him if anyone asks you to do anything. No one has asked me. They like to imply. Maybe they think this is noir and they’re mysterious. Meanwhile I’m over here with a bucket trying to prevent municipal calamity.”

“Prevent calamity,” she said. “That is a noble mission statement. We should put it on a T-shirt. Also, if you do end up in a noir, please don’t wear a fedora. Not everyone looks good in a brim.”

He left with a cinnamon scone he did not intend to eat and ate half of it before he reached the crosswalk because trying not to eat a cinnamon scone is like trying not to look at a sunset. At the building, the day unrolled. Keys turned. Doors sighed. A woman in a blazer he had never seen carried a binder like a person holding a newborn. The council chamber smelled of wood warmed by air. He cleaned a spill that had no origin story and buffed out a scratch on a plexi sign that told people to be kind as if signs could change tempers. He waited for a text and one did not come, which was worse in the way the body hates a lull when it has learned to expect a sound.

At four, Lowe called and said he’d like to swing by his place, if that was okay, because sometimes seeing where a person exists helps you understand their map. Owen said yes because saying no felt like the stubbornness of a man who thinks he is not connected to the place he sleeps. Lowe arrived with a smile and a notebook and an ability to stand in a room without making it smaller. He looked at the ribbon on the fridge with the interest of a human who enjoys being in a town where a ribbon on a fridge means something. He asked what Owen did between nine and midnight on any given day and Owen made a joke about toast and told the truth and felt a heat in his face that was not shame but the thing that comes when someone writes down your life in bullet points.

“You’re not in trouble,” Lowe said, as if detecting the temperature. “You’re just in the middle of a thing that might be a thing and might be a nervous person trying out power. There’s a crew covering the fireworks area tonight and the night after. Gates with locks and a guy named Sven who lifts more than is strictly required by society. You don’t have to go be a hero. If you see something odd, call. If your friend with the rolling pin gets a message, tell her to not reply. If someone tries to hand you a bag to leave under a table, throw it in the river. That last one is partly humor. Don’t throw bags in rivers. But don’t carry anything that isn’t yours.”

After he left, Owen stood in the kitchen and watched the way light falls on a late summer evening when the sun is tired but proud. He cut the seed bread and buttered it with the reverence you give to something that happened because hands worked. His phone was quiet. The neighbor’s television offered a medical drama where a surgeon made a joke right before saving a life. He dictated a text to his father he didn’t send about how doing nothing feels like a task. He wiped the counter with a rag until it gleamed. He was aware of his own framework, of bones that have had decades to learn how to carry a man in and out of small boats of life. He did not think of pie.

Thursday morning the sky was the color of refrigerator light and the wind wore a jacket. He stopped by the fireworks field because he had to see or he would invent. It was cordoned with well-intentioned fences and a sign that said Authorized Personnel Only in type that thought bold meant stern. Two men unloaded boxes that did not reveal their secrets. Lowe stood with a thermos and a posture that said, you can come no closer, and waved at Owen with an economy that made it friendly and not chatty. He waved back and kept moving because he did not need to be another body in a place where bodies were being counted.

He made it to the office five minutes before his shift because he had read somewhere that being early is good for your teeth. Inez patted his arm with that perfect pressure that says I’m here and then made a goat noise because she could. They moved through the day together the way a good team moves through a kitchen, wordlessly dancing around stools and avoiding each other’s momentum. At noon he got a text that was not the kind they had been receiving but a photo of a raccoon with a piece of bread. Brayden had sent it with the caption, Choose to be kind. He smiled and let it soften something that had started to calcify.

The weird thing about days with suspense in them is they still want you to buy milk. He went to the grocery store after work and stared at apples in pyramids and had the thought anyone in a panic has at produce, which is how can the world be this specific and banal at once. He bought spinach because it looked like it could fix a soul. He bought a magazine with a crossword because crosswords trick your brain into thinking you’re on a mission. He told the cashier his number and they pretended it gave him points that would one day buy him a toaster.

Friday, the text was silent. Saturday morning, the town set up chairs and blankets with the choreography of tradition. Brick sent him a message that said, Perogy contest volunteers meeting at nine, bring your stomach and your moral compass, and a photo of a pierogi with a face drawn on it that was both adorable and wrong. Mira snapped a picture of a pie with a perfect lattice and no context and sent it with a caption that said, Remind me why I do this to myself, and then followed it with, Because someone eats it and smiles. He walked through the fair like a man walking through a set he had helped build. He bought a lemonade from a child whose seriousness about her cash box made him want to nominate her for mayor. He declined a cinnamon donut because life is choices, even if half of them you only pretend to make.

At dusk, the field breathed like a sleeping animal. People spread out under the sky. Laughter did that thing where it beads and rolls. In the distance a train said its own name. Owen found a spot near the edge where you can get out if you need to because a man who thinks about egress more now than he did at twenty is a man who has worked in rooms with only one exit and learned to plan. He texted his father, I am sitting on a blanket like a sensible person, and got back a picture of the kettle with the note, Me too.

As the first flares cracked upward with that tiny cough that precedes the blast, his phone buzzed and his stomach drew itself into a fist because the body does not care if you are trying to enjoy lights. He looked. The message said, It’s pretty when things go as planned. He waited seven seconds and then ten. He watched the shower of white and remembered being small and thinking they must be catching stars and releasing them. He waited, and nothing else came. He felt foolish for how he had braced and then unmanned by how relieved he was. He watched the show with an eye on the fence even as his heart surrendered a little to the theater.

After, on the slow flow out of the field, he ran into Lowe, who had a smudge on his cheek that could have been smoke or chocolate. “All right,” Lowe said. “Sometimes that’s what we get. All right.”

“All right,” Owen said, and they stood in the river of people for a beat as if refusing to be carried until they chose to be.

On the way to his car, he saw Vernon standing alone under a lamppost, blazer slung over his shoulder like a man who would not admit he sweated. He looked up and gave Owen a thumbs up that was more graceful than most thumbs. “We did not have drama,” he said. “We had only light. I will sleep for three hours and then I will think of a new thing to fret. Come to the pancake feed tomorrow. Bring your appetite and a small sense of gratitude we can all borrow when ours runs out.”

Sunday morning the pancakes were sponges for the syrup of grace. He flipped a few at a volunteer station because someone handed him a spatula and he could not say no to a man with a beard net and a smile that scratched the air. He spilled batter on the griddle and learned on the second try that patience is in fact a tool. He met a woman who had taught him in fourth grade how to multiply by nines with your fingers and he thanked her because it seemed time. He laughed with Brick and did not mention perogies because that felt like tempting the gods, if small towns had gods, which they do, and they’re sometimes goats.

When he got home, he found an envelope tucked in the crack between his door and the jam, a trick everyone who has ever left a flyer has learned because mail slots are for landlords. It had no stamp and his name in a hand that was trying very hard to be ordinary. Inside was a photograph printed at a place that still does such a thing. It was the hallway outside the mayor’s office, and in the corner was a mop bucket under a sign that said Wet Floor in a silhouette of a man who had fallen in a sticky triangle. His chest did a small trick. Nothing bad in the picture, just a picture of a place he knew in a time he had been there. On the back, printed with a very fine pen, two words: Nice shine.

He sat on the edge of his bed with the photograph in his hands and thought, this is a person who wants me to know they can watch. It was petty and theatrical and maybe the kind of thing a person does when they want you to be a character in a story you didn’t ask to be in. He took a photo of the photo and texted it to Lowe with the caption, New fan mail. Then he texted Inez a picture of his own face making a face and she sent back a picture of her knitting a sweater for a goat with the caption, Everyone needs a hobby. He texted Mira a close-up of the word shine and she wrote, Obsessive. Underline. And then, I am making cinnamon rolls tomorrow like a person who believes in mornings.

He set the photograph on the table and put a coaster on top of it as if the weight mattered to anything and then he laughed at himself because coasters have never stopped a flood or a man. He took a breath. He looked at his keys hanging on their hook. He thought of doors being his profession and his life. He told himself the truth that living is ninety percent squeegeeing small puddles and ten percent dealing with a wave. He got up and did the dishes because your hands get busy when your head can’t decide. He hummed a new tune that might have been an old hymn and thought, okay. If this is a story, I’ll do it the way I do floors. One square at a time. And if it isn’t, I’ll still keep my rags clean.Chapter 5

Heat came in with the confidence of a friend who never knocks. The mornings stopped pretending to be cool even when they were blue, and the afternoon wind smelled like someone had left a bread oven door open somewhere on the prairie. The building took it in and let it out the way old buildings do, sighing around expansions and contractions, settling into the season with a creak. Owen’s mop water looked like melted coins in the bucket before the soap turned it into a lake where citrus clouds drifted. He dragged the mop in straight, stubborn lines and thought about how light sits differently on a floor in July. It’s less forgiving, more direct. It tells the truth about places you missed.

By nine the first text arrived like a mosquito no one had invited. Leave the south door to the annex on the latch tonight, it said. No one will know. You’ll sleep, town sleeps, everyone wins. He read it twice and the skin between his shoulder blades tightened the way it does when a breeze comes from a door you didn’t know was open. The annex door was the one Inez calls The Door of Destiny because it sticks in winter and flirts in summer, a door that could make a sermon out of any day. He put the phone in his pocket and it burned there like a small stove.

He could have kept it to himself for an hour, maybe two, to see if his brain would build a case for pretending, but he had promised too many people not to be ridiculous. He walked it straight to Darlene, who was eating a yogurt with the resignation of a woman who had wanted a donut and the discipline of a woman who knew what donuts do at two in the afternoon. She didn’t say are you sure even though some bosses would have in a voice that puts the burden back in your hands. She said, “We call Lowe,” and sniffed the yogurt like it might apologize.

In Lowe’s small office the fan clicked as it rotated, the kind of click you stop noticing if your nerves are not tuned for it. Lowe listened and the corners of his eyes did their little squint that could be humor or could be the way a man reads a map he’s seen before. “We set the table, then,” he said. “We don’t put the dish where they ask us to put it. We set the table where the dish belongs, and we leave out something unappetizing.”

“What does that mean,” Darlene asked, practical down to the fibres of her blazer. “Because I am not setting my table with a stink bomb.”

“It means I put my person where they expect you not to,” he said. “It means if the request is about the south door, we make the south door sing like a choir when it opens and we leave the west door alone like a sleeping cat, and anyone who knows their way around will go where they think we’re dumb enough to give. It also means I would like your permission to tuck a camera in your fern. No, not the sad one. The one with ambition.”

Darlene’s mouth went sideways. She loved her ferns the way some people love particular pens. “The fern will testify if it must,” she said. “But if anyone waters it while you’re in there, tell them to stop. It was emotionally overwatered as a child.” She turned to Owen, and whatever bossness she kept around for days when people argued about time sheets drained out and left something older. “You don’t touch that door. Not by accident. If you were the type to be tempted, which you aren’t, this would be the day to consider how long it takes to rebuild trust. It is not a mop head. It is slow.”

He thought of keys, of the way they whisper when they thread through their ring, of the weight of them against his hip when he walks. He thought of being trusted with entries and exits and how it had quietly become an identity in a way that had nothing to do with exceptionalism and everything to do with showing up. “I hear you,” he said. He heard himself, too, and the part of him that wants to compromise to make a nuisance go away sat in a chair and did not get a say.

At lunch he took his sandwich to the back steps and watched a grasshopper lose a fight with a gust of wind and then win the second round like an athlete who’d read all the wrong stats. He called his father because you don’t always wait until Sunday for the normal voice. His father let him tell it and did not interrupt except to ask which door, because specifics calm him. “Do you know why that door,” he asked, and Owen said he didn’t and that he could make ten arguments for it being any door because people like to pretend they’re thinking of a door when what they want is to see if you’ll do what you’re told.

“That’s someone testing the edges of you,” his father said. “People do that when they can’t manage their own. Don’t be angry in a way that makes you sloppy. I am proud and somewhat worried in equal measures, which I suspect is my permanent condition until they put me in the ground and I start worrying about the worms.” He chuckled and made tea too strong and said, “Lock your locking, son,” and Owen found the laugh loosening something.

The bakery was a soft ferocity when he stopped by. The lights looked as if they had read a poem and wanted to be kinder. Mira had a smear of cocoa across one cheek that made her look like she’d survived a battle and won. On the counter lay an array of small locks in packaging, a nest of keys like a school of fish, and a lemon tart that had not yet been asked to be perfect.

“You look like a man who is thinking about hinges,” she said, sliding a plate toward him because she has learned that if you hand him food his mouth will eventually say the thing he came to say. He told her about the text, about Lowe’s plan, about the fern with eyes, and she made the face she makes when she has both an opinion and the wisdom to deliver it gently. “Nobody asks you to make your own life smaller unless they already made theirs too small to live in,” she said. “You do not become less just because someone says please. See how I did not swear. Are we proud of me.”

“Yes,” he said, and meant it. “Do you know what I thought of when I read it. My eight-year-old self standing on a chair and my dad saying don’t touch the stove, and me touching the stove because touching is the way to learn. This is not a stove I need to touch in order to know it’s hot.”

“Look at you growing your prefrontal cortex,” she said, and took the cocoa streak off her face with the back of her hand just to smear it on the other side. “I got another thing this morning. From a different number, I think. It said, never mind about staying open late, what if you just stop making those ugly braided loaves. And they spelled braided like a person who had been betrayed by braids. I had to sit on my hands so I didn’t write back and tell them my loaves are prettier than their soul. I blocked it and then I iced a batch of cupcakes so exacting I scared myself.”

He didn’t like that the messages had multiplied like rabbits on spring grass. He didn’t like that their edges fuzzed out into the whole town the way gossip is a fog and not a line. He told her he’d be in touch after the door plan, and she told him she would be at home with a rolling pin and a movie and a willingness to throw her phone in the freezer if need be. He wished he could guarantee her a quiet night the way you wish you could guarantee someone will love you back. You can promise your actions. The rest remains a community project.

They rigged the annex like a house at Halloween, except less fun and with more paperwork. Lowe’s person turned out to be a woman in a jacket that did not mind the heat, hair tucked up neat, manner like a Sunday school teacher with a black belt. She gave the kicked fern a rueful pat and tucked her camera low and sat among filing cabinets as if she’d been there forever. Owen made his passes like a man walking pixie dust into a plan, checking that the jalousie window on the west side caught fine dust when he snapped it, wiping down the glass with a blue rag that left nothing but the scent he associated with working and sleep. He felt watched and did not like that he liked it less when the watching was on his side. He told himself it was good. He told himself once and it was enough.

The night edged in with its summer soundtrack of skittering bicycles and someone two blocks over trying the guitar with more enthusiasm than technique. He finished his shift a shade later than he wanted and allowed himself the laziness of leaving a chair not exactly where he had found it because he planned to put it there in the morning anyway. He stood at the south annex door long enough to feel like a cliché, then walked away. He locked the west door and double-checked it, so he would not build a movie in his head about what he had done wrong. He said goodnight to the building just loud enough to make himself smile.

If the person who sent the text had been a character in a book he would have arrived with a cat under his arm and a hat too serious for his head. Instead, he came in on sneaker soles, quiet not because he was practiced but because night makes us all lighter. Lowe’s person watched him on a screen the size of a paperback and wrote something down she would copy into a report later. He passed by the south door and put his hand on it in that way people touch surfaces to make sure the laws of physics still apply. He tried the handle and frowned when it didn’t give. He moved toward the west door with a little huff in his chest that was either indignation or exertion. He had a bag that did not sag enough to hold anything dramatic. He had a posture that said apology rehearsed and readiness scratched. He went for the west door as if he had not been told what to do about a door but knew a lot about what the building does anyway.

They let him open it and then stepped into the space the way people who train to do this move without drama, just correctness. “Evening,” Lowe’s person said, as if she were interrupting a man checking church pews for left-behind Bibles. “You have a key for that.”

The man’s face did an alphabet. Surprise, indignation, reasoning, charm. He went with charm and then abandoned it three words in for irritation because charm is a suit you have to fit for, and it had not been tailored for him. “I work here,” he said, which is a sentence as unhelpful as I belong here. “I had to grab something I left.”

She asked to see his badge and the way he reached for his belt told her everything. He did not wear a badge. He wore a clip where a badge might be if he were the sort of man to clip one there. His hand hovered as if he could conjure a rectangle with a photo on it through wishes and the friction of his fingers. She asked his name then, and when he said Joel, something that had been resting in Owen’s head like a small bird with a broken foot lifted and turned over.

Joel. The coworker with the tendency to treat all jobs as equal because all jobs needed a body moving in them and he had a body. Joel of the sloppy edges, the ghost shifts, the airing of grievances so passively you needed a translator. Joel who sometimes left a mop head sitting in the bucket as if mop heads like being baptized for hours. Joel whom Darlene sent when she had no one else to send and apologized to the building under her breath because she’d be the one to fix the corners later. Joel with a jaw that clenched when Darlene picked someone else for the church contract and who had once suggested in a voice he thought was quiet that if the council changed over next fall, contracts might change, too.

They walked him into the light like a man being introduced to the stage for the first time and sat him at a table as if this were an interview. Lowe appeared out of the corridor with that gentle faux-surprise he uses on people who need to be told what is already obvious. He offered Joel water and asked whether he likes events, whether he likes fireworks, whether he likes attention. Joel answered like a man walking down a hall where doors keep opening and behind each door is a person who wants him to say yes. He said he was trying to prove a point. He said if people saw how thin the staffing is they would stop calling Darlene at home at eleven about a paper towel dispenser that wouldn’t behave and start feeling grateful. He said he had been embarrassed for months by the low-grade messes he couldn’t clean when he wasn’t on the schedule, that pride is weird in a janitor, that nobody sees you until you fail.

It was a story that could sit in a room without being pitched, and it could also be a way to not say something else. He had a can of stink in the bag, old-school and destructive to nostrils, but not the kind of thing that would make the six o’clock news. He had a towel in there that didn’t belong to any building they knew. He had a key that had once opened a closet in the community center before Darlene re-cored it, which is its own story if you know how buildings hold on to their teeth. His phone had numbers in it that Lowe would not scroll in front of them, because there are laws and also because decency is not a law and still matters.

Owen was allowed to be part of the room the way the person who finds the first footprint on a flour-dusted floor gets to stand a little closer to the crime. He watched Joel fold into himself, not dramatically, not like a man being booked in a movie, but like a person who had come at night with a plan to feel bigger and instead realized he was small in the precise way we all are when the lights are this bright. He felt anger fizz and settle. This wasn’t sexy. This was a man with a bag and a small story who had sent texts like a boy playing spy. This was also a man who knew his way around wet floor signs and valves and the habit of hiding digital footsteps. You can fit more than one truth in a room, especially when it smells like lemon polish and rethinking.

The parts that followed were dull in the way justice should be dull. Statements written in narrow boxes. A call to a boss. A decision not to put handcuffs on a man who had mostly threatened theater. The bag labeled. The fern turned back toward the window, because even in municipal dramas we do not leave plants facing walls. Lowe’s promise that unspectacular charges are still charges and that people change their behavior for two reasons: they get held, or they find a story they like better. Joel looked like neither option had been available to him for a long time and like maybe, with this not-ordeal in progress, a door had cracked that wasn’t the annex.

After, when the building was a body exhaling and Inez relocated her concern into action by reorganizing the drawer where the batteries live, Owen found himself sitting on the back steps again, heat still popping off the asphalt like a body trying to shake water out of its ears. He expected relief like you expect a glass of water to be cold and was surprised when his throat wanted something warmer. He phoned his father and told him the version that didn’t include all the private names, and his father said the sentence he says when a human makes a human mess. “I don’t excuse his bit,” he said. “But I recognize the recipe. Maybe we can get him a different cookbook.”

Brick texted the way a man texts when he suspects he is not the kind of friend who gets called first but wants to be the kind who shows up second. Did you get your raccoon, he wrote, and then, Sorry, that’s my metaphor when people try to get in your bins. He followed it with, Perogy practice Wednesday; someone’s baba is going to yell at me about my technique and I will cry. Bring your tastebuds and a towel. Owen wrote back that he’d come, because practice in any form was comfort, and because babas yelling love you in a sharp language under the edges.

Mira was leaning in her doorway when he came by with no intention except to stand in a place that knows how to smell like welcome. She listened to the story, and her eyes did that soft crinkle at the corners that makes you understand why people tell her things that cost them. “I despise that,” she said. “I despise someone making you think you’re a piece in their game. And at the same time, I could cry for him, messy mop and all.” She shook her head like a dog getting rid of water it did not ask for. “We have a rule in here. When we fight with our dough—because we all fight with our dough—we have to say nice things to it for a full minute before we throw up our hands and give up. It works on people, too, sometimes. Not always. You can’t make bread rise with compliments alone. But it’s a start.”

“What nice thing do we say to a man who tries to convince you to leave a door unlocked,” he asked, feeling the joke roll through his chest like a ball he could carry without tripping.

“We say, you are more interesting than the worst thing you did this summer,” she said, and then made a face. “And then we say, pay your fine and get a different job if you can, because you’re not allowed back in my back room with that attitude.”

They ate a slice of the lemon tart with the concentration of scientists. He told her about how the camera was hidden in the fern, and she laughed until she hiccuped. She told him about the kid who’d come in with his grandma to buy one cupcake and stood on his toes to see and told her, whisper-serious, that the strawberry looked the most like a planet. He thought about how maybe if more people were asked to choose planets from cupcakes, fewer stink devices would ever get purchased from a sketchy online store with free shipping.

You would think a town exhales and goes back to ring toss and therapy after a week like that, but life does not stack itself neatly. Vernon found a way to have an emergency about table rentals and a person in the mayor’s orbit called twice asking whether the fern was traumatized and whether there was a way to put security on the rest of the plants because you know how these things go, one fern gets the bug and the next thing you know a ficus runs away. The local online mom group produced three lengthy posts about whether leaving a door unlocked counted as endangering children and two about whether fireworks at all are insensitive to dogs, which, Owen had to admit, they might be. Lowe came by to thank him with a box of timbits like a man who knows how to speak Canadian, and Inez knitted a little thing that turned out to be a koozie for the spray bottle they share, which she announced with pride as if she had invented mittens.

The perogy practice at the community hall was a clatter of bowls and vowels. A line of women and two men who had been drafted rolled and pinched with the assertive tenderness of people who know food is language. Brick arrived with flour on his shirt as if he had got into a fight with a bag and apologized to it. He made a mess of his first dozen and apologized to a grandmother named Svitlana who swatted his knuckles with a spoon and then kissed his cheek hard enough to knock gratitude into his skull. Owen found he was passable at the pinch if he imagined it was a tiny wet floor sign he had to fold, a caution into a comfort. They ate their ugly ones with fried onions and sour cream and a communal silence that attends the right foods.

Cannon showed up late with a new T-shirt advertising Chomp Squad, LLC, and a grin that made children like him despite themselves. He clapped Brick on the back, gave Owen a nod that had nothing smarmy in it for once, and told a vivid story about a festival in Red Deer where a man tried to sneak a second stomach under his shirt and almost got away with it. Someone told him the perogy event was charity and not a competition, and he said every potluck is a competition to the right auntie. He was not wrong. Owen left with a container of dumplings that steamed his windshield and a sense that eyes on him were friend-eyes again, not phone numbers hiding behind a curtain.

At work, the day after Lowe spoke to Joel’s union rep and a letter had been composed and a bench had become useful for a while, the pink notes on the board returned to their ordinary job. Inez drew a goat in sunglasses. Someone wrote a reminder to make two extra pots of coffee on Thursday for the building inspectors who become miserable when caffeine is a theory. The annex door got a new plate on its latch that made it make a different sound when it closed, a more confident clack. The fern looked toward the window like nothing had ever happened, a professionalism Owen envied a little. He swept and mopped and buffed, and he hummed, because if he stopped that, then the texts had taken something they were not allowed to take.

Occasionally the memory of the photo in his door—Nice shine—would surface like a fish in a pond, breaking his surface with a ripple. He left it under the coaster where it belonged, not to be honored, but not denied. There is a difference. He told himself the thing he knew was true: that his work puts him in the path of everything people leave. Some of those leavings are spills. Some are notes. Some are, regrettably, human. That is not a reason to stop, any more than a drip is a reason to abandon a sink. You shut the valve. You grab the towel. You teach the floor how to be dry again and the air how to smell like what you can count on.

The week put itself to bed, and the next week tried on fresh nonsense like a hat. A woman from Facilities called to ask if he could sanitize the conference room chairs extra hard because a consultant from Calgary had sat in one and declared he’d gotten a rash that smelled like lemon oil. Inez printed a sign for the copier that said, Speak Kindly To Me, I Am Sentient And So Are You, which made three people laugh and one man write a serious email about professionalism. Mira brought him a small pie, savory, with potato and dill and a pastry so short it tried to escape itself, and he took it home and ate it over the sink the way bachelors do when the fork is too far away.

On Friday he and his father sat on the front step with mugs so hot you had to commit to them and the sky doing that July thing where it pretends to be August. His father told him about a new neighbor with a dandelion army and a hand more suited to painting than to weeds, and Owen told him about learning to pinch dough from a woman whose hands were smooth and strong like rolling pins passed down through too many dinners to count. They did not talk about Joel because there is a limit to how many times you can tell the story of a man who tried to be large and made himself small instead, and because the story had been discussed enough to not be the freshest air. His father touched the mug to his lip and did the small hiss he always does and said, “You look steadier,” and Owen thought, it isn’t the absence of nonsense. It’s that he’d been reminded nonsense isn’t the only weight.

Late in the evening, as the heat finally admitted it was tired, his phone buzzed with a number he recognized now, not as the anonymous pest, but as an unfamiliar friend. Lowe. You should know, it said, in the bland diction of men who have to put things on paper later, the statements are done. We’ll supervise a restorative thing if both agree. If not, there will be a small court day no one enjoys. He added, on a second line that felt like an afterthought with sincerity peeking through, Your fern was brave. Owen laughed into his empty apartment and wrote back, Thank the fern for me, and then, Thank you. He set the phone face down not in defiance but in the practice of being a person without constant light.

On Sunday, Brick dragged him to the river valley market in Edmonton, all honks and buskers and gluten-free hope. They walked among the stalls like tourists in their own province. A woman sold honey out of jars like jewelry. A man carved names into belt leather with a flourish. They watched a toddler negotiate with a dog the size of a small horse and concluded the toddler had the upper hand. Brick bought a skillet he didn’t need, which is the only way to buy a skillet, and Owen bought a second-hand novel because someone had written in the margins with a neat hand that disagreed with the author in the kindest possible way. Cannon sent a photo from a different market where he was promoting his brand in a shirt his girlfriend had bedazzled and no one felt threatened by his enthusiasm, which is how enthusiasm should be tolerated in decent places.

On the drive back, the road did its ribbon thing and the fields lay like content animals and Brick cleared his throat in that particular way large men do when they are about to step into a small feeling. “Don’t let anyone name you with their bad day,” he said, watching a hawk ride a wind he couldn’t see. “My granddad told me that. He said he’d spent forty years having men try to relieve themselves of their weather by putting it on his back. The best days he just let it go down his coat and onto the ground. The worst days he carried it home and apologised to the table.” He chuckled and shook his head. “I don’t want to apologize to my table. It holds my food. It deserves better.”

When he told Inez about the fern note and Lowe’s text and Brick’s granddad’s advice, she listened with her knitting in her lap and miscounted stitches on purpose to show she was paying attention to him. “All right then,” she said when he finished. “Here is our plan. You will continue to make the world less sticky. I will continue to knit ridiculous items for inanimate objects as my way of rebelling against chaos. We will attend the perogy charity with our faces saying gratitude and our stomachs pretending we’re polite. And when the next person thinks they can write your lines with their thumbs, we will say, no thank you, I have a script.” She held up the goat sweater, which had achieved an armhole by accident. “Also, what size is a goat’s neck. Tell me you know. You know everything else about this town.”

He didn’t, and that was a relief. The final night of the month he stood in the quiet lobby after a double-shift that had been less about cleaning and more about moving chairs for a budget meeting that could have been an email, and he let the air settle around him. The glass gave him back a face he recognized, a little older, a little more assured that the way through a story is foot by foot. He turned off the last light with a flick he had perfected and listened as the hum fell to something like sleep. In the dark, his keys whispered. He whispered back, because sometimes that is how you learn where you are in your own plot. Then he walked out into heat that had learned moderation and the smell of mown grass and the distant rumor of fireworks that live in other people’s towns, happy for them the way you can be happy for a neighbor’s luck. He locked the door, checked it without making it about superstition, and headed toward the shape of home with the day under his arm like a folded towel, wrung and clean.Chapter 7

August loosened the rope on summer and let it wander, heat pooling in odd places and shadows showing up like late guests who’d been invited by mistake and decided to be charming anyway. The mornings came in thin at first and then laid on a thicker hand, the light less golden now, more brass, precise and unforgiving on scuffed baseboards and the seam where the vinyl met the tile in the second-floor corridor. The building made the sounds of a creature adjusting to a room with one more person than it expected: an extra tick from the exit sign, a new whistle from the air conditioning that had developed an opinion. Owen rolled his bucket slow, listened for what wanted tending, and let his hands find their answers the way they always did, by touching what his eyes had already decided to love back to service.

Lowe’s email came on a Monday that had the nerves of a first day of school even though everyone had been sitting at these desks for years. It was brief in the way bureaucratic kindness can be, the necessary nouns and verbs arranged in a steady line. There would be a restorative meeting for those affected by Joel’s choices, if those affected wished to attend. Volunteers would be present from a community organization whose logo was a circle around a tree. There would be tea. Joel had agreed to come. “No surprises,” the email said, as if preemptively apologizing for the world’s habit of offering exactly that. When he read it a second time in the break room with the smell of burnt coffee attempting to pass itself off as toast, he could feel the nervous animal in his chest put its paws down and tilt its head, listening for the tone beneath the words.

They met in the church basement that knows the town’s secrets the way a rug knows where people stand when they speak truth. Metal chairs made their spatial music as they shuffled into a circle. In the center sat a basket of objects that looked like the junk drawer at the end of a hard winter: a smooth stone, a knitted square, a laminated photograph of a soccer team from years before Owen moved back, a pen that had stopped writing but refused to be thrown away. The facilitator was a woman with greying curls who wore her reading glasses on a chain like a tiny necklace of authority. She placed a hand on the basket like she was making a benediction and said her name—Rowan—and set the rules on the ground like tools: we speak to be heard, we listen to understand, we pass if we are not ready, the tea is there if your hands need something.

Darlene sat with her shoulders square, a clipboard in her lap because even in the soft rooms she kept one in reach. Inez had come without fuss and brought in a plate of muffins that resembled the planets as drawn by a child in a hurry. Vernon arrived late and tried to fold his height into a chair made for smaller men, his blazer asking for applause even when the man did not. Owen took the chair he could see the door from with ease, not because he did not trust the room, but because he had learned to give himself this small gift without having to justify it to anyone who wasn’t him. Joel sat opposite him, as if someone had drawn a line across the circle and put them on either end to balance the weight.

Up close, Joel looked like a man who had been taken out of his script too early. He had the twitchiness of someone who had told himself three monologues and was trying to decide which one fit in his mouth without making him choke. When the talking piece—a sanded-down bit of wood that felt like a handle to nowhere—came to him, he didn’t grab it so much as let it land in his palm and stay, and his first breath was that sound people make when they finally admit they have been holding one too long.

“I… I wanted it to matter that we were needed,” he said, and the words had the stubborn plainness of two-by-fours. “I wanted someone to realize that the reason there aren’t messes is because someone’s there to catch them. I kept thinking if a thing stank enough people would… I don’t know. Look up? Notice. Call for more bodies so we weren’t just a name on a list you call when your coffee hates you. I told myself I’d do… worse if I had to. I didn’t. Doesn’t make the not-worse okay.” He looked at his hands like they had answers. “I sent some of the messages. The ones about the door. The one to you about shine.” His eyes flicked to Owen, met, retreated. “Not the bakery ones. That wasn’t me. I don’t know who’s got that in them.”

Owen let the words come into him, then lay them side by side the way you do with screws and nails so you know what width of hole needs filling. It was a relief and not, to have half the fog burn off and still see a shape standing behind it. He could see the story’s appeal from Joel’s side: the small joy of finally triggering a reaction in a world that begs for invisible hands. He could also see the hollowness left behind when the stage lights you begged for finally breach the dark and you aren’t ready for what your face looks like.

When the wood piece came to him, it felt like the handle of a small cupboard door, the kind you open when you want a glass to fill and a place to put it down again after. He hadn’t planned words because planning had never made words better for him, but they came with the same steadiness as a floor wash done properly. “Keys make noise,” he said, and heard Inez’s breath turn into a soft laugh because she knows the sound. “They whisper and they clink and they say you belong here in the useful way, not the permanent way, and I like that. I like that someone decided I could carry access and not abuse it. I like that you can count on a lock pressed shut as much as you can count on me to open it when it’s time. Your messages tried to turn that into a test, and I hate tests I didn’t sign up for. But I hear the… want in what you did. I hear the wanting to be seen. I get that want. My mother could make a table sing with a cloth and you’d never know her name if you ate on it twice a week for twenty years.” He looked across at Joel and didn’t make his mouth into anything it wasn’t. “If the job’s breaking you, change the job you do at the job. Or leave. Don’t break the building to see if anyone loves it. We’ll all clean it, they’ll clap, and you’ll still go home feeling like the wall no one noticed.”

Rowan made the kind of sound a kettle makes when it boils for the second time, soft and proud. Darlene, who had been letting her clipboard absorb her glare, put it down and let her hands be hands. “We can carve you something that doesn’t make you feel like a mop on legs,” she said. “That’s on me as much as it’s on you. Training. Mentoring. You’re right that people see a spill before they see who sealed the floor last week so the spill didn’t stain. We can note the sealing. We can put names on the work. And you’re off after nine for a while. Not as a punishment. As a kindness to me so I don’t have to sit at my kitchen table wondering what door you’re thinking about.”

Vernon cleared his throat to insert himself into the scene like a side character who knows his cue. “If we are doing accountability, let me say on the record that the cones being moved was not the wind, as I publicly speculated to save face. It was children who wanted to make a maze. The children apologized via macaroni cards that still smell like glue. I will be retaining the cards as a reminder that sometimes the universe chooses to surprise you with joy instead of disgust. Joel, I’m not your boss, but I use your work like a clown uses a mirror. I want you to find a better show.”

They made agreements the way people decide on potluck dishes: practical, a little optimistic, with contingency plans. Joel would spend six weekends supervised at the skatepark with Brayden and the youth group rolling paint over sun-faded tags. He would write apologies to the people who got the worst of the texts, including Owen and Darlene and “the fern” because Rowan was a woman who believed in naming the whole truth. The union would send a trainer with the patience of a grandparent to teach him the tricks of machines he’d been using like they were enemies. He would not go near the bakery with any attitude that was not pastry-positive for the foreseeable future. If he stuck the plan, there would be no courtroom. If he couldn’t, there would be papers, and anyone who had ever sat in a court knows papers do not care about your best intentions.

After, at the table with the tea that had steeped too long and was now medicinal, Inez patted his elbow in a way that also re-anchored him. “You did good, hanger,” she said, and then added in a voice meant to carry, “And in honor of all restorative practices, you may have the last muffin even though it was technically promised to my imaginary goat.” He took it because refusing her gifts felt like throwing a blanket on a cat that had chosen you.

The bakery took its inspection like a stoic who knows where the bruises will be. The inspector was a narrow man with a generous smile and a thermometer he treated like a friend he trusts to remind him of the truth when he flirts with lies. He introduced himself as Sanjay and complimented the chalkboard menu with an honesty that made the compliment stand taller than the chalk’s wavering lines. He did the system with Mira that people use when they have to check a kitchen that is both a livelihood and a personality: open, glance, test, close, note; repeat; crack a joke about how ovens become divas in their middle age; praise the clean corners, frown kindly at the drain cover that had rusted into modern art.

When the thermometer beeped over the trays cooling on the rack, he nodded in the way a man nods when mechanics purr. When the thermometer beeped under and he did his little sigh, Mira’s posture faltered for just a heartbeat. Owen, who had come by with a box of new floor mats bought with his hardware-store discount and an enthusiasm he dressed up as practicality, stood by the sink and used his hands to find the new tune of the valve he had learned months ago. Sanjay asked about labels and Mira produced a label maker that had opinions and began spitting out labels with the gusto of a talkative aunt. Inez arrived mid-ordeal with a roll of paper towels and a temper that frightened bureaucrats into common sense and charmed them into extending deadlines they did not need to extend.

By the end, there was a list that looked longer than it felt, because some items on lists wear tall hats to look important. Mira had a new timeline for the mats—as if they hadn’t fallen like gifts into her lap—an instruction about keeping a log the way teenagers keep diaries, a promise to replace two cracked containers she’d been meaning to kiss goodbye and hadn’t because morning comes at you like a train. Sanjay signed with a flourish that said he had the heart of a man who secretly acts in community theater and told her what he tells all the bakers he likes: put your thermometer where you see it. Put your signs where people will read them while pretending they won’t. Put your faith in your habits, not in last-minute miracles. She nodded and bit her lip and after he left she leaned against the fridge and let out the long exhale she’d been saving since eighteen.

“You handled him,” Owen said. “Like he was a cake you were not going to let fall.”

“He was kinder than the last one,” she said. “She had a soul like a sharpened spoon. He has… sun under there. Thank you for the mats. Don’t tell me how much they cost or I will both refuse and probably scold you, and neither of those things fits me today.” She fiddled with the label maker and accidentally printed the word cinnamon six times in a row and handed him the strip like a fortune. “You going to the perogy thing, or are you avoiding babas who will insist on pinching your cheeks and your dumplings.”

“I will be where the onions are,” he said, and felt his stomach get ahead of his mouth, making plans it wanted his brain to honor.

The community hall smelled like childhood and church basement and the promise of a meal you didn’t have to cook. The stage had a polka band that was two-thirds accordion and one-third grin, and someone’s nephew on a borrowed drum kit who discovered the joy of brushes and chose restraint for the first time in his life. Long tables blazed with plates and the complicated choreography of communal eating, people at different ends playing passive-aggressive tug-of-war with the sour cream. The library’s donation jar sat next to a stack of flyers that had been folded and refolded into airplanes by children who protested the cost of literacy until they were handed a book they wanted to devour and forgot their complaint in the first paragraph.

Brick wore an apron that had been white once in Alberta history and now bore the record of onions and kindness in topography. He handed out plates with a solemnity that made parents trust him to give their children the right ratio of food to food-mood. Cannon had been drafted into emcee duty by a woman with a voice like a scythe and a soft spot for confident young men, and he did the job with a self-mockery that saved him from being a caricature. He introduced the baba brigade like a sports team, complete with nicknames—“The Crimper,” “The Speed,” “The Architect”—and when he called for a round of applause for Svitlana, who had donated thirty dozen of her magic from a kitchen where the countertops sit slightly lower than modern fashions, the roar would have made a smaller town think there was a fire. Owen took a turn at the sink because he knows how to respect a system; he washed until the water ran less onion and more hope, and every time he turned the tap the hose gave him a friendly slap like the hand of a coach telling him he’d make the team if he kept his knees bent.

He did not compete but he stood at a station where someone had piled the “ugly ones” and made it his job to move them discreetly onto plates so no one would feel like they were eating from the reject pile. If the trick to being a person at a charity feed is to carry your own appetite without making it the only guest, he did well. He watched Brick’s face halfway between ecstasy and humility when Svitlana corrected his technique with a laugh that chose to forgive the whole of manhood in one noise. He laughed until his ribs made little protests when Cannon tried to demonstrate a perogy flip in the air and succeeded only in decorating his shirt with a scar of potato that looked like Saskatchewan. He put ten dollars in the jar because eleven felt showy and nine felt stingy, and he told the librarian that replacing the children’s reading rug with something less reminiscent of the eighties would make a lot of knees thankful. When a boy in a hockey jersey stood up in line and announced with righteous despair that he had gotten a cabbage roll in his perogy section, Owen traded him plates without making the boy feel like he’d been rescued from a war. Sometimes heroism is the swap no one else wants to do.

After, he walked out under a sky that had left a little lavender for anyone who looked up and found Mira sitting on the concrete stoop, papers fanned out next to her like a flock of exhausted pigeons. She had flour in the laces of her sneakers, which made him absurdly happy, as if he’d caught her in the middle of a sentence that proved a theory he’d been entertaining about her hands. She made a space with her hip without comment, and he sat, and the concrete read their temperatures and decided to even them out.

“I got complimented by an inspector today,” she said, still stunned. “I was going to write it in a journal if I kept a journal. I will instead etch it on the back of my hand like a high school cheater and consult it when I feel that feeling that whispers I am ridiculous and the world will find out.”

“You are ridiculous,” he said, and when she slugged his shoulder with a knuckle the size of a blueberry he caught her grin in the corner of his eye. “In the way that people doing beautiful things have to be. What are you reading.”

She showed him the papers facing down—an application for a small business grant that had the earnest smell of government money—and a sketch of the bakery’s back room with boxes arranged in ways that suggested she was courting change. “I want a second oven,” she said, and then looked like she wanted to apologize for ambition. “I want to do more of the things that bring me actual joy and fewer of the things that pay the rent but also flatten me into a person who solves the same puzzle three hundred times a month. I want to hire a kid and pay them decently to learn how to make pastry without tears so that later in life, when everything is noise, they can make a pie and shut the world up for an hour. Is that so wrong.”

“It is the opposite of wrong,” he said. “It is so right I feel I should stand and recite a pledge. You going to ask Vernon for letterhead or will that give the grant committee hives.”

She groaned and let her head fall back. “I will ask Lowe to write about crime prevention through pastry. He will use the phrase ‘pro-social glazing’ and the committee will be forced to put me on a poster.”

His father called the next morning and said, in a voice that had the lilt of a boy planning to run away with a friend, “Are you available to leave responsibility for four hours and go to Wabamun with a cooler and an insufficient amount of bait.” It is difficult to refuse a man who can make failure sound like an adventure, so Owen packed sandwiches that would travel, found sunscreen he did not trust, and met him at the gas station where men stand very close to their trucks and contemplate the price of fuel like it might perform contrition if glared at long enough.

They drove with the windows down because air conditioning had decided to be temperamental in the way machines do when they wish to be praised for what they still offer. The lake tilted into view like a coin someone’s grandfather pulls from behind your ear, obvious and still magic. They rented a rowboat because the outboard had been loved too hard by teenagers the weekend before, and the young man at the counter had that beaten-but-brave look of an employee who says yes whenever the world tells him to say no. They rowed because it’s good to do a thing that requires every muscle and none of your brain, and the lake laid itself out like a patient that trusted them to do no harm.

They caught nothing and told each other the old lies because they fit the mouth like hymns. His father told him again the story of the 1956 fish and the punch line—third place in a contest no one remembers and a reputation in a family who remembers everything—and they laughed because repetition is the glue in love. On the slow tack back to shore, his father didn’t clear his throat so much as he pressed a button on his chest that made a different register come out. “I had a letter once,” he said, and watched the oars so he didn’t have to watch his son in the say it. “When I was the night man at the high school. Anonymous. Said if I didn’t leave the auditorium door a bit cracked on the night of the spring dance, so-and-so would make sure my… my lazy work was noted in the board minutes. Spelled lazy with an s like a snake hissing at me. I told your mother. She said, ‘You tell your own story, not the snake’s.’ I locked the door and sat in a chair with my thermos and read a paperback and when the snake did not get his way he melted and left a smear on the back step that wiped up easy. Those boys—because it was boys—grew up to sell insurance and apologize to my face in the Safeway. I accepted without letting them make me the priest who absolved them.”

Owen listened like a man pulling in a net and hoping not to haul up his own foot. It made something click to hear the line run back that far, to know the town’s foolishness was not new and his position in it was less visionary than he sometimes lets himself believe. “I don’t get to be the priest either,” he said. “But I don’t mind being the guy with the towel when there’s a spill. You always liked the towel guy.”

“It’s all I ever wanted to be,” his father said, and then laughed in that way that makes other people at the lake turn their heads and approve.

The week rounded its shoulders and carried on, new grooves and old habits braiding themselves into a pattern Owen could trust by feel. Joel’s first Saturday at the skatepark looked like a parable for humility; Brayden filmed a fifteen-second clip that made it to the town’s bulletin on social, a slice of sun and paint and a man being taught to keep his lines straight by a thirteen-year-old with an earnestness that made people forget the anonymous and remember the named. The messages to Mira stopped except the good ones, the ones that used too many exclamation marks because you could taste the sweetness behind them and you didn’t care if punctuation suffered. Vernon sent an email full of capital letters about an Oktoberfest that would happen in September because he refuses to be told by calendar what joy looks like, and attached three spreadsheets that announced themselves as “fun” as if adjectives could perform miracles when asked nicely.

In the municipal building, the inspectors came, and the chairs were wiped, and the water cooler hissed when its bottle was replaced with the sound of a snake who had decided not to bite. Inez knitted a sleeve for the shared remote control and labeled it Remote Remorse because she had run out of phrases for kindness and was moving into small acts of redemption. Darlene bought new mop heads out of her own budget and sent the receipt to Accounts with the subject line “Sanity,” and when the reimbursement came back three weeks later with a smiley face, she framed the post-it because you frame small victories the same way you frame your children’s finger paintings, with seriousness and pride.

On a Thursday that tried on wind just to see how it looked with the trees, Owen stood in the bakery doorway with a bag he was pretending he had not intended to fill and watched Mira balance a tray on her arm like a dancer who had traded pirouettes for the practical ballet of getting hot things to safe places. The radio was playing something with fiddles that made you imagine flat roads and loyal dogs, and her hair had escaped its long-suffering knot in two places and was doing opinionated curls near her ear. He felt the want that had snuck up on him over months like a dog that had decided he was worth following and decided to do the stupid brave thing and answer it before it wore him out.

“Do you want to watch a documentary about bread with me,” he asked, and his voice came out in the register of men who have seen better attempts in their head and are going to stand by this one anyway. “It’s very earnest and I think we can make fun of it and also cry.”

She set the tray down in a way that told him she had not burned herself more than was acceptable for the time of day, and she studied him as if he were a recipe that had forgotten to list the butter but clearly included it somewhere. “That is the best possible way to spend a night I can imagine and also a terrible way to make me pretend I don’t actually care about it,” she said. “Yes. There should be popcorn. And you have to promise not to say ‘gluten’ like people say it on TV.”

“I will say it like a hymn,” he said. “I will honor its syllables. I will bring the kind of salt that sticks to your fingers.”

They did watch it and they did both nearly cry when a French man touched dough like it was a sleepy child and they did eat too much popcorn because balance is for mornings with meetings. He fell asleep later with the smell of yeast and butter and television light in his hair and woke up unafraid of his phone, which was a gift he noticed and did not ridicule. When he checked it, it had only a picture from Brick of a perogy shaped accidentally but unmistakably like Alberta, with the caption “found your province in the pan” and three fire emojis that Brick used sparingly, as all thinking men should.

On a late night when the building was almost all hushed and the light in the council chamber made the room look like a painting that someone had left on a bus, Owen did the rounds that always bring him back to the start of things. He checked the handles without making it about the old superstition that if you don’t, something breaks purely out of spite. He turned off the last hum with a touch he had perfected and knew he’d miss if he ever left, the way you miss a particular banister when you move houses. In the dark, the glass did its trick and gave him himself without the polite lies light tells. He lifted his keys and they made their aural confession, honest and small, and he confessed back without words. Outside, heat had made friends with night and the air smelled like cut grass and the faint ghost of someone grilling two blocks over. He walked toward home with his day folded under his arm like a towel that had done its work and would be clean again in the morning, and he let himself be exactly as okay as he was, which turned out, for a Thursday, to be more than good enough.Chapter 9

September walked in with its collar up and its hands full of apples. The mornings started late and ended early, and the daylight in between lost that summer swagger and became something more precise, like a teacher tapping a board with a pointer. The municipal building felt it in its bones. The air vents found a new rattle, the glass held handprints longer, and the hall outside the council chamber kept a faint smell of pencil shavings that arrived with committees and left with arguments. Owen carried his bucket like a man bringing water to a tiny, thirsty republic, and the mop head fanned itself across tile in straight gospel lines. By eight he’d talked to three different stains about redemption and to one maintenance guy about a hinge that insisted on singing in B-flat when it closed.

The town did its seasonal costume change without any fuss. Vernon hung a banner in the lobby that said OKTOBERFEST in letters so cheerful they needed to be sounded out twice, and then marched out the door with two clipboards and a look that suggested clipboards might mate in captivity and produce little clip-children. Inez knitted in primary colors and declared she’d begun on a second goat sweater because the first had turned out less like a garment and more like a friendly puzzle. Darlene taped a note to her own door that read No, I Cannot Approve Your Pumpkin Spice Use of the Copier, Love You, which drew three laughs and one carefully constructed complaint from a man who could write official emails about anything.

Mira’s chalkboard took on gourds. She drew a pumpkin that was somehow both smug and self-conscious and wrote, Be kind to each other and to pastry, the former being difficult some days, and the latter being an insult to pastry if attempted without tenderness. The afternoons in the bakery were warmer than outside, proof that ovens change the seasons on their own schedule. She had the grant application spread across the back counter one Monday like a map of a place she’d never visited but wanted desperately to say she’d been. It was the unromantic kind of paperwork, the sort that asks you to count things you haven’t counted before: hours on task, kilograms of flour per week, the number of times a day you reach for a bowl that would be better placed four inches to the left.

“You ever notice how math is both infuriating and reassuring,” she said, pencil behind her ear and an inch of focus in front of her that nobody got to touch. “It’s like, here, quantify your dreams, and also, look, your dreams can be quantified and now you can move them around on a piece of paper until they fit.”

“I’ve noticed math can save you from your feelings,” he said, stealing a glance at the oven clock like it could keep time on his behalf. “And then your feelings crawl back in from the side door and ask if you’d like some tea.”

She smiled without looking up, and he felt that small victory sit honestly in his stomach. They had watched the bread documentary and been both cynical and moved in the right proportions, and now their conversations had pockets, secret and useful, they could reach into when a day required it. He didn’t call it anything; he didn’t have to. Words like Beck and Courtship sound like Victorian letters and turn perfectly good realities into plays.

Vernon’s Oktoberfest was not in October, which he said was a tradition if you said it into a microphone and people clapped. He booked the hall for the second Friday in September because he’d been outmaneuvered by a quilting convention and took the defeat with the grace of a man who would one day name a pavilion after himself. The plan involved oompah at a polite volume, sausages sourced from a German grocer tucked beside a tire shop, and a beer garden that would serve a local lager in biodegradable cups that promised to break down nicely in landfills like well-behaved ghosts. He wanted string lights, three food trucks, a polka lesson, and a mercy station for men who wore their leather shorts ironically and found irony cold.

Owen watched the setup with a fondness that had very little to do with the event and everything to do with the way a town makes a stage out of what it already has. He hauled barricades like they were furniture for a room he’d one day get to sit in, and he told a teenager how to untangle extension cords without cursing them into snakes. The cool in the air made the cords feel like obedient rope, and when the bulbs blinked in sequence, the lights made the parking lot look suddenly European if you squinted and had a generous heart.

He was thinking about mirrors and floors and that particular way dusk falls over rectangles of asphalt when Lowe slid up beside him like an apology that had found its place. “Two things,” the constable said, and offered him a timbit like a peace offering he hadn’t asked for and was glad to receive. “Joel’s made it through two Saturdays without sabotaging anything more significant than his own ego, and a grandmother named Svitlana made him cry twice in one afternoon by calling him honey and showing him how to hold a roller. Also, the bakery texts seem to have stopped. Not idle hands. Something more like distracted hands. Whoever it was has moved on or been moved.”

“You talk to all your suspects like that,” Owen asked, not wanting to give relief too much of the stage in case it took advantage and refused to exit. “Distracted hands.”

“I tell part-timers to keep their hands where I can see them, and I tell worry to sit on the back step,” Lowe said. “You good if I bring my girl to the polka thing and teach her how to step without stepping on me. I want her to know a little ridiculous is the only way to carry adulthood.”

“You ever the picture of composure,” Owen said, because he has learned that teasing is love if it lands right, and Lowe’s grin took it in like a dog given its favorite word.

There were small dramas and none grew teeth. Vernon’s rented sound system fought him for two hours and then suddenly decided to be agreeable, like a cat you’ve humiliated yourself for finally stepping into your lap. The bratwurst arrived two hours early and had to be convinced to nap politely in warming trays, which they did until one burst in protest and gave a teenager a story. A woman in a dirndl made from what had once been an Ikea curtain told Cannon she wasn’t impressed by his chewing speed and then asked for a selfie, just to keep the universe on its toes. Brick learned to polka in a way that used all his corners and half of his caution, and when he got it right he looked like a house learning to float. Owens’s father came for an hour, insisted he could waltz over a polka any day, proved it on the corner near the beer tent, and then bowed with a flourish that made three women decide he was charming and one man decide that maybe he did understand what it was to carry a day without complaint.

In the midst of this, there was a quiet thing. Mira stood at the edge of the lights with a paper cup of beer she would not finish, the foam marking how sentimental she was willing to get. She had on a cardigan that had seen winters and a skirt that carried conversations. She caught his eye, then let it go, then caught it again, and when he crossed over the asphalt in three steps because the music had made his predictability take a seat, she held up a piece of paper folded into a square as if it were a small creature she’d chosen to release or keep.

“They want me to come and pitch in person,” she said, and kept her voice steady because if she let it wobble the whole world would wobble with it. “I sent the numbers, and now they want to see the person who wrote the numbers. The man in the office said, ‘We like a story to go with our spreadsheets,’ and I didn’t tell him the story was that I can cry at the sight of flour measuring itself into a bowl.”

“You’re going to go and talk about dough like it’s destiny and they’ll give you money because even people who count coins for a living have mouths and you can feed a mouth into a mind,” he said. “And if they don’t, you’ll make the second oven happen anyway, and someday they’ll buy your column in a newspaper that still allows language that tastes good.”

“You’re a menace when you’re supportive,” she said, but could not help the way her mouth softened in appreciation. “You and Inez and your father is going to show up and clap from the hallway, isn’t he.”

“He will pretend to be part of a tour and then stares at the wall and cry a little,” he said. “We will bring him a muffin to excuse his presence.”

“Please bring him two muffins,” she said. “I need him on my side of the ledger.”

The week that followed was the kind that looks ordinary from the sidewalk and turns out, upon closer inspection, to be full of small shifts. Joel’s restitution moved from awkward apologies to a kind of workmanlike relief. He fixed a handle in the community center that had squealed for a decade and looked two inches taller for having made something better with a screwdriver and a promise. Brayden took to following him like a well-intentioned mosquito, buzzing with ideas for how to improve the flow of people at events and the positioning of trash cans to maximize compliance. “I don’t care if you put the cans in a circle and call it art,” Vernon said, overhearing and slipping into the conversation in that way he has of arriving just after he’s needed to be there, “if it gets us fewer ketchup tragedies.”

The bakery had its own tiny revolution. A second-hand store in Devon closed in mourning after the last of its bruise-colored cardigans had been bought and the owner decided fishing was a better use of shoulders. In the back, an oven sat with a sign taped to it that said, Works Fine, We Just Stopped. Mira heard about it via the intricate grapevine of women who have moved towns but not lost their capacity to know where the good things are. She wanted the oven and didn’t have the truck or the arm strength alone, and Owen made the calls, and Brick arrived with a borrowed trailer and the grin of a man who loves nothing more than a heavy object and permission to lift.

They made an afternoon of it. They wrapped the thing in moving blankets like overprotective aunts, they strapped it down so gently that the oven would later say, if it could speak, it had never felt so safe, and they drove that ugly metal beauty along back roads that made the journey feel like a secret and a promise. Mira sat in the lead car and refused to look back because if you look back at cargo you love, you invite fate to show off. Owen watched the mirror because that is how he functions in the world: forward, sideways, backward, keeping three narratives stitched to a single road. They arrived without mishap, which felt like a miracle only because so many things don’t, and they slid the oven into the bakery with the hush of a large thing deciding to be home.

It told the room it was a worker, not a diva. The old oven gave it a look that said, we will either be friends or partners who irritate each other professionally, and the new oven preheated like it knew it was being tested. Mira fed it a small tray of shortbread as a courtesy. The kitchen filled with that butter sum that can make a funeral bearable and a Tuesday less mean. Sanjay, notified via text and lured by the scent like any sensible man, dropped in with his thermometer holstered like a peacekeeper and approved it by giving it a nickname. “She is a Lark,” he said, patting the side with professional affection that could yet be denied. “Do not question my instincts. She will sing for you.”

She did. The second oven cracked the bakery’s day open in a way Mira had expected in a spreadsheet and still couldn’t quite believe in her hands. The racks filled with twice the number of croissants and yet none had to be rushed; the pies baked in pairs like twins who don’t mind sharing toys; the morning felt less like a sprint and more like a steady run with breath you could keep. She wrote her pitch for the grant between turns of dough and smudged adjectives with butter without apology. She practiced aloud once, only once, in the back room with her hair feral and the flour motes drifting like a snowfall that had forgotten its season. Owen heard the rhythm from the front and felt something like pride that you get to feel only if you’ve held a flashlight in someone’s flood.

Because the world does not believe in a single plot line for a life, the day of the pitch was also the day of a minor pestilence. The municipal building’s second-floor men’s room decided to have feelings about its plumbing. At nine, it gurgled as if remembering a song. At ten, it lied and pretended it was fine. At eleven, it attempted to cascade. Owen was there because of course he was, with towels folded precisely like the Navy teaches and a plunger with a handle he’d sanded down himself because splinters are a metaphor nobody needs. He shut the valve by feel and by muttered encouragement, and he stood in rubber boots while water made its case and lost, slow enough for a man to maintain dignity and fast enough that the floor didn’t need a sermon, only a mop.

It was not how anyone wants to spend an hour, but it was a kind of blessed contrast. Mira texted him a thumbs-up as she walked into a room full of folding chairs and three people in business casual making their own faces presentable to strangers. He texted back a picture of a towel and the words Holding the line, which is what it always is. She stood at the front of the room and told them about ovens and mornings and the geometry of circles you fill with fruit and hope, told them about teenagers who need a job that is both simple and exacting so they can practice focus without a screen, told them about the economy of cities that understand that bread and coffee are not extras but infrastructure. She did not cry because the part of her she’d prepared did not need to, and the part of her that gets weepy did so later in the stairwell where no one would think they had caused it.

She came out with practical instructions for next steps and a look he would come to recognize, a look that said, whether or not they said yes, I was true to my own version of events. They all celebrated as if the yes had already arrived because there are days you need to lead a cheer into the room and let the yes catch up later. He brought his father, who acted casual, and Inez, who did not, and Brick, who ate four cinnamon rolls and cried twice during a polka that came on the radio by accident. Cannon came by with his girlfriend and let Mira put him behind the counter for five minutes; he froze at the register in the way giants freeze and then recovered with an apology so charming no one could hold it against him.

The grant committee’s yes came by email on a Tuesday as the leaves began to commit to their yellows. It was not dramatic. It did not come with balloons or an official knocking on a door the way you might fantasize when you’re twelve and the world feels like a comic book. It came with three bullet points and a PDF attachment and a request for proper receipts. Mira sat on the back step with her phone and made a sound that was two parts laugh, one part relief, and stirred it with a fork. She texted him the three letters and a photo of her shoes, and he got the message on a ladder in the lobby changing a bulb and had to make a decision about whether to climb down to be dignified or to shout from the rung. He climbed down and went to the bakery and she kissed his cheek with a quiet he knew not to narrate.

Over at the skatepark, the restorative Saturdays grew less performative and more real. Joel had begun to bring small things from home to repair more small things on site—a screwdriver with a handle that fit his palm, a roll of tape that seemed like it might save a life if wrap were a category of sacrament—and the kids needed him less for instruction and more for presence. Brayden declared him “not awful” in front of his friends, which anyone who knows teenagers knows is a benediction, and the older men who leaned on the metal fence pretending to supervise learned to say hello without an edge. Lowe stopped by and watched from the shade, making himself perfectly ignorable, and let a half-smile haunt the corner of his mouth when a boy said to another without meaning to be profound, “It feels better when it looks better,” because there it was, the slogan for every effort undertaken by people like Owen and Joel and all their quiet kind.

One message found its way under Owen’s door that month, a last vestige of anonymity that felt more like a habit than a threat. It was a list torn from a spiral notebook, spiky handwriting that had learned in school to be legible and had since chosen drama. It said, Be careful who you help. It had no signature and no return to sender, and he read it, then read it again, then set it under the coaster on his table with the photograph from months ago. He did not send it to Lowe because he did not want to build a case on crumbs. He did tell Inez, who sniffed and said, “Everyone who writes on spiral paper like that thinks they’re the hand of fate. If fate has a hand, it does not choose budget office supplies,” and then knitted faster, which is her way of cursing in public.

More days stacked. He built and rebuilt the path from door to door, swept and mopped and buffed, and took satisfaction in the way the floor tells you when you’ve done it right without asking for thanks. He and Mira sat in her kitchen on a night that was finally cold and ate soup like it was a form of justification. They made a game of naming everything they were grateful for that wasn’t a thing you can take a picture of. He picked the silence right after a laugh that means you’ve hit something true; she picked the moment when a room takes your shape and relaxes because it recognizes you. He said the smell of his father’s tea, never the taste. She said her landlord’s habit of telling bad jokes and then apologizing to the room for having told them. He laughed until his throat went soft and then admitted he had begun to think of the bakery as a place he could keep his hands, like a bench with his name written under it in pencil.

October chose not to enter quietly after all. The first cold morning fogged the windows with wet breath and pretended not to be winter. Vernon announced, because there are always announcements, that he had booked a choir for the pumpkin lighting, that there would be a prize for the best carved gourd that was not scary because the yelps of children are fun only in their first syllable, and that he needed someone to hold a ladder because the fairy lights he’d borrowed had opinions and those opinions were hung four inches out of his reach. Owen held the ladder because of course he did. Brick held the other side and shouted exaggerated cautionary phrases every three seconds to make the children laugh and the parents relax into their posture. Cannon arrived with a box of donuts and was tolerated because he is both chaos and on-brand kindness, and all the teenagers with phones filmed the lights going on like they had never seen lights do that before, which is one of the lovelier lies we tell ourselves.

Mira lit the first pumpkin and pretended not to like being asked to. She allowed the moment on her face and then filed it away under the section in her head labeled Things You Don’t Have to Talk About to Keep. Her second oven sang softly; you could hear it in the tone of her day. The grant money arrived in pieces because money never arrives all at once unless you are being struck by a bus or hit by fright, and she counted it like prayers and spent it like strategy. She ordered a stainless table and a second mixer that looked like it could pull a tractor, and she hired a teenager who came with a reference from Brayden, which is to say she came with a willingness to be teased and a capacity to take instruction without dissolving. She named the girl Tully in her head because the girl had misheard a greeting and replied, “That’s me,” and sometimes a town gives you your name whether you are prepared to legally accept it or not.

In a week stitched together with sleep and sugar, Owen’s father turned seventy, though he refused to say the number out loud because numbers are fun until they aren’t. He agreed to a cake at the bakery against his own inclination, and what followed was less a party and more a visitation. People came by as if they had appointments and he said hello to them as if they had just dropped off a book. Mira made a chocolate cake that was not austere and not silly; it was serious fun, and the frosting shone like a polished shoe. Inez wrapped a bow around a tin of cookies and told him to open it in an hour because some pleasures require a schedule. Lowe dropped a card in Owen’s pocket addressed in small precise letters and escaped back into the warm. Brick hung back because he felt too big for the room, then came forward when Owen pulled him with a look, and told the old man that his son was the sort of man who quietly saves entire days and never tells anyone, and the way his father said, I know, had Wednesday mornings and long-ago thermoses in it.

The message under the coaster didn’t turn into a pattern, and that was perhaps the point. Not everything will. He caught himself hoping it had been a final fling of attention and not the opening of a new act, and then he told himself not to practice dread like it was an instrument worth learning. He promised himself instead to keep doing the thing he knew how to do, to mop and to lift and to look, and to say yes to the things that got his heart to move forward. He said yes to one more polka where he and Mira pretended their feet were smarter than their heads and it turned out their feet were kind. He said yes to a small road trip to pick up a set of shelves from a woman who used the phrase “shabby chic” without irony and who fed them orange slices in a way that made the day feel like a kindergarten class. He said yes to an early morning when the sky cracked open pink and a man with a broom watched the light make the dust on his floor look like glitter for half a second before it became ordinary again.

The pumpkin lighting happened under a sky that understood the assignment. Dusk took its time and let the choir’s breath rise in white puffs that made the notes look like they might have a body. Vernon tried to coordinate six things with eight hands and succeeded because five other pairs of hands appeared where needed, and the teenagers who used to move cones for sport now moved them into perfect lines as if they had been converted to a religion whose saint is Flow. Joel was there, standing beside Brayden with a posture that didn’t need a special vocabulary, and when they nodded at Owen across the lights it wasn’t a secret handshake so much as an agreement among custodians.

They lit the pumpkins in a line that looked like a sentence the town was writing to itself. The faces were not all pretty. Some were aggressively goofy. One looked like the artist had despised the world that day and tried to carve it into submission. One had no face at all but had been turned into a lighthouse with a careful chisel and a battery-powered candle. Children squealed in the right way and a dog barked twice and accepted the night as arranged. Brick couldn’t stop grinning and Cannon managed to hand a donut to a crying toddler without being accused of interference in the child’s necessary developmental crisis. Mira leaned into Owen’s shoulder in a way he nearly didn’t notice because it is sometimes how a life sneaks by: with the normal weight of a person you already know by smell.

At the very edge of the evening, when the last plastic cup had been chased across the parking lot and the lights hummed with that end-of-shift music they make when they know they are about to go dark, a woman Owen did not recognize watched him coil an extension cord and approached as if asking a favor were a hobby. She was in her thirties, maybe, younger if you were generous, older if you had spent any time looking into faces and counting the inches of history. She had a coat that would not be warm enough in an hour and a posture that said she was about to tell a story she both wanted and did not want to tell.

“You’re the janitor,” she said, and he nodded because a man should agree to his place in the scheme of things at least once a day. “You work with Darlene. You’re—Halvorsen.”

“Owen,” he said, watching without staring because you can learn as much from what people are not asking for as you can from their words. “You need a mop or a key or a hand.”

“A key,” she said, not smiling. “To something else. I—All right. I did some dumb. I sent some things I shouldn’t. Not to you. I mean. To the bakery woman. The texts. I thought—who knows what I thought. I thought she took something from me that was mine. It wasn’t mine, it was an idea and you can’t own ideas any more than you can own a sky. I thought I was making the playing field even because she had a line out the door and my cupcakes looked like a funeral even when it wasn’t one. Then… I saw her at the inspection that day. The man was so careful with her. It made me feel like a clumsy person in a china shop. I’ve been sticking receipts under her door like a teenager and you can tell me to go take a long walk off a short ridge. I’m tired of carrying a story that isn’t true.”

He stood still because this is what you do when truth approaches with its hat in its hand. He waited for the part where she named herself, because that can make the difference between repair and ritual. “Heather,” she said after a pause, and the name fitted the look if you knew old high school yearbooks and the way hair gets cut when you can finally afford to pay someone to not make you look like your aunt. “Heather Woldt. I do cakes in Stony. Weddings. I thought. I got so scared that she would… I don’t want to be the villain in a town with this few villains. You tell me what penance is. Don’t tell me to be her friend. We are not the same kind of people.”

He didn’t want to be the priest. He remembered, from the boat with his father, how easy it is to assign yourself the mantle of forgiver and end up wearing it like a costume that doesn’t fit. “You tell her,” he said. “You tell her in a way that doesn’t make her do any work to comfort you. And then you leave her alone unless she asks you to do something different. And you make your cakes like the world depends on them, which it does for the two hours people cut them and say vows. I will tell Lowe because I promised him I’d tell him about puzzle pieces. He will act like it’s not a big deal and then he’ll write it down because that is how he remains sound. And you stop using anything but your name. If you can’t, you come here at nine on a Wednesday, and Inez will look at you until you do the right thing.”

Heather laughed and then made the face of a person surprised by her own laugh. “Inez is a witch in the best possible meaning,” she said in a tone that intended respect. “All right. I’ll go tell the pastry woman I was awful. She will either network it into a polite handshake or strip me of my epidermis with her eyes. I will accept either.”

When she’d gone, with her coat not warm enough and her step resolved, Owen felt the place behind his lungs light and dim like the pilot in an old furnace. It wasn’t triumph. It wasn’t even relief quite. It was that gentle shift you get when a long, small wrong tips back toward right, and you don’t have to hold yourself at an angle anymore. He told Lowe and let the man be thorough. He told Mira and let her be kind without being a doormat. He did not tweet or post or tell Brick because it wasn’t story for entertainment; it was the workplace of forgiveness, and you don’t take pictures there.

The pumpkins softened over the next few days, as pumpkins do, and the town passed small decrees about when it is appropriate to throw beauty into the compost. The wind found a new edge, the sky traded one blue for another, the bench outside the municipal building grew cold in the morning and then warm and then cold again. The perogy charity sent a thank-you card with far too many exclamation points because gratitude cannot be calibrated when onions are involved. The second oven learned the voice of Mira’s days and made it easier for her to stand up straight. The keys in Owen’s pocket made their soft map of a man’s movements, and he traced it not as a routine but as a practice.

One evening he took his father to the footbridge behind the arena where you can watch the pond consider freezing and the geese plot their commute. They stood with their hands in their jackets and their breath in front of them, and said the kind of things two men say when a month has been both eventful and ordinary. “I get to be useful,” Owen said, not being specific because he didn’t need to be.

“You always did,” his father said. “It’s just easier to tell now. It shows better in this light.”

He thought about light and how it gives, how a floor absorbs it and throws it back, how a window accepts it and shares it, how a pumpkin hoards it for a while and releases it like gossip. He thought about the bakery, about the municipal building, about the reef of chairs in the council chamber that he could navigate in the dark with only his knee. He thought about Mira’s hands and the way they make circles that change the mood of an entire room. He thought of promises made to angry texts, to leaky valves, to plants with cameras behind them, to men who—given instruction and a team and a forgiveness that had structure, not sugar—remembered how to be part of a town instead of its antagonist.

It was enough, for that month, to walk home with the smells of October in his scarf and to have nothing louder to report to his own head than the inventory of his day. The front step had leaves gathered at its crook like gossiping aunts. He swept them into a pile and let the wind have some because partnership is all, even with breezes. He hung his keys on their hook and the sound was the one he’d known since he’d learned to listen for it. He made tea badly and buttered bread properly. He set the photograph back under the coaster and whispered nothing in particular into the room, which received it and sent it back in the form of a quiet that was not empty. He slept without waiting for his phone to light, his ribs at last behaving themselves like a choir after rehearsal, and dreamed only of floors that gleamed because someone loved them by hand.
