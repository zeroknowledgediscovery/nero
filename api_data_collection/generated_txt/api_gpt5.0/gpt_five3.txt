The first laugh rose from the canal like steam.

Alex heard it as a smear of sound through the wind that came right off the water, thin and high and then swallowed, and she thought for a heartbeat that it was a gull. Then there was another laugh, lower, broken up by hiccups that meant crying, and she braked so hard the back wheel of her bike shivered underneath her. The towpath was a long gray ribbon, the midnight lights from the old granary reflected in little skittering lines across the black water. Fulton loved to say it slept early. Not tonight.

“Hello?” she called out. Her own voice sounded big and clumsy against the river.

No answer. Just the hush, the reeds scissoring, her chain ticking, the aftertaste of laughter that wasn’t her own.

Alex pushed off again slowly, letting the front lamp of her bike swing more to the water than to the path. She didn’t have to be out here. She could have been home with the plants under the window and the clack-clack of her neighbor’s tap shoes upstairs. A cyclist. A sergeant, too. Fulton didn’t have many of those who were both, and sometimes people nodded like it was a novelty. “You, with the calves,” Deputy Parnell would say, and grin. Tonight she’d said she needed air and left her phone face down on the kitchen table, the badge folded into a dish with her keys.

The laugh came again, very close, and she skidded to a stop. “Hold up,” she said, softer. Then, remembering: “Police.”

Behind the maples and the narrow staircase that went down into shadow, something shuffled. Alex swung off the bike, her cleats clamping into the wet grit, and let it fall against the guardrail. She walked in, ducking vines. Her breath fogged. She pushed a branch aside and found the space under the stairs where the homeless sometimes slept in summer, the flat patch of dirt, and a boy wedged in like someone had poured him there.

He was sixteen, seventeen maybe. His face glowed like a fish belly. He was breathing fast. He laughed once more when he saw her and flinched at the sound of his own laugh.

“Hey,” Alex said, and made her voice like she used to when her nephew was small — it came back without asking — okay, okay, what’s this now. “You’re all right. You’re all right.” She crouched, and slow. “You fall?”

He shook his head. “No,” he said, and then his chest hitched the way it does when laughter’s gone too long. “He… it’s… he just…”

“Who?”

The boy pressed his palms to the dirt and fast, urgent, looked at his hands as if he was counting something. “He tickled me,” he blurted. “He does that. He tickles you so you— you can’t— your breath— and he—”

She smelled the river in his hair, the iron of the bridge, the sweetness of leaf rot. She kept her own breath long and steady because that’s what people mirror, especially teenagers, especially men who keep trying to be boys. He wasn’t bleeding. He had both hands. He had a blue cord around one wrist, maybe from a sweatshirt that had been cut. His pupils were wide disks. He seemed to want a wall to press his back into, but everything here was either brittle or soft.

“What’s your name?” Alex asked. “Do you need an ambulance?”

He shook his head hard enough to knock sweat off. “I won’t go to the hospital,” he said. Then he swallowed the rest of whatever he was going to say, like a secret was a big pill and he was retrying the swallow.

“Okay,” she said. “Okay.” She stood up, half turned so he could see the path past her shoulder, as if it was a thing she had laid there with her hands while he was looking away. “Walk with me. I’ll get you to the road.”

He hesitated. “I didn’t do anything,” he said.

“I didn’t say you did.”

The boy rolled up onto his heels and then stood, faster than she expected, knees knocking dirt off. He looked over her shoulder, past her, toward the water. “He’s big,” he said, very soft now. “He’s big and he— he laughed, too.”

Alex nodded once as if that was familiar to her already. Big. Laughed. Tickled. She put the pieces together like little tiles on a bar top, and they didn’t make a picture yet, just a pattern that hurt the eye if you stared too long. She walked ahead of the boy and picked up the bike with one hand. On the path they moved side by side, her pushing, him with his hands tucked into his armpits and his eyes sewing the river to the dark in a crooked line.

“I need your name,” she said finally. “So I can write in my head how brave you were, and how you came out from a place most grown-ups would pretend isn’t there.”

He looked at her like he didn’t know if she was making fun of him. His mouth broke into an unwilling smile for a second that she would not have called handsome but it made him look like the kind of person you might chat to while waiting for a bus.

“Eddie,” he said. “Eddie Bentley.”

“Thanks, Eddie,” she said. “I’m Alex.”

He squinted at her legs. “You’re that cop rides everywhere.”

“I am.”

The river clicked. Somewhere a car door closed. A dog barked twice and then decided that was enough. When they got to the road, the streetlight was the old kind that hummed, and the late-blooming pear tree held its blossoms like a bride it had married a week ago and still couldn’t believe. She took a breath to ask Eddie if he had somewhere safe to go, and he took one to tell her something else, and then the radio in her pocket went off though she’d left her phone on the table. She had forgotten the radio was clipped inside her jacket like a heart.

“Dispatch to all units,” it sizzled. “We have a call from Gale’s Salvage on West Third. Caller reports disturbance, possible assault. Repeat, Gale’s Salvage.”

Eddie flinched like the word assault had mass.

“It’s okay,” she said, and put two fingers to the radio. “Moran here. I’m close. I’ll swing by.”

“Copy, Sergeant,” the voice said, relieved, because you always hear that when somebody has put a title where a human ought to be.

She looked at Eddie. She looked at her bike. “I can call somebody,” she said. “Your parents.”

“No,” he said too fast. “No cops, I mean— no more. I’ll go to my aunt’s. She’s… she’s good. I know where to go.”

“You sure?”

He nodded, and when he took a step back he glanced over his shoulder again, and she saw that what he was checking wasn’t the darkness in general but specifically the stairs down to the water where the shadows went in and in and in like mouths.

“Be careful,” she said. “If you see him— if you see anybody you don’t like seeing— you go somewhere bright, somewhere with other people. You make noise. You throw something through a window if you have to. You call me.” She rattled off her number twice until he repeated it. It wasn’t policy, but policies mostly lived on paper. Out here you had breath and attention and an hour of night.

“I won’t tell anyone,” he said, as if she had confessed a secret too. And then he ran. He ran with his hands half lifted like he might fly, like a kid, and she imagined his aunt’s house lights coming on, imagined the face at the door, somebody wearing a robe, a pet nosing past his knees to lick salt off his skin.

Gale’s Salvage was a rectangle of corrugated metal with a yard that looked like a bowl full of thrown-off moons, broken appliances shining back the streetlights. Gale herself had taken the call; when Alex wheeled in, the older woman stood with her fists tucked into the ATV jacket she wore like armor. She was taller than most men and had a jaw you could strike a match on.

“Thought it was kids messing around,” she said, without the hello. Her breath came out in smoke. “Wasn’t.”

“What happened?”

Gale nodded toward the back. “I keep the good stuff inside. Old switchboards, carnival signage, some of those barber poles that actually work. I heard something fall, I thought, this is it, some little punk finally got over the fence. But when I came around the corner he was— he was in there with the door torn open like paper. I yelled. He looked at me. And I— I felt my knees go like they had little minds of their own and wanted to go in the opposite direction.”

“He,” Alex said.

“He,” Gale confirmed. “He was big. I’ve seen big guys. He was— it wasn’t just tall. It was— he didn’t fit inside the room right. Like somebody drew him with the wrong pencil. He had a jar. I know that sounds like nothing when there’s so much else, but he had this big jar, like those ones they used to keep sugar candy in, the round kind? With a lid like a bell. He was looking in it like it had a screen.”

“What was inside?”

Gale looked over Alex’s shoulder at the night. “Hands,” she said flat. “Kid hands.”

Alex kept her face where it was. She did not let her eyes go wide. She did not let disgust flicker in a way that Gale would see and then try to comfort. She said, “You’re sure?”

Gale’s chin went up. “Two of them. Floating like—” She stopped herself. “I told you. I know what I saw. I yelled and he grinned at me, and then he laughed. He laughed like— like it was an audition, like he was trying them all on. I can’t explain. I’ve been wanting to laugh for hours just to get it out.”

Alex looked toward the back of the yard where a door hung sideways. The locks were bent, not cut. The metal had a twist to it like gum. Big. She thought of Eddie’s breath catching. Tickled. The jar. Kid hands. She kept her mouth shut over the place where the bile wanted to come.

“Did he touch you?” she asked.

Gale’s eyes flickered in annoyance. “What am I, an appliance? No. He didn’t come at me. He let me look. Then he put the lid on the jar and tucked it under his arm like he was heading to a picnic and stepped out. In the light I saw his face. He looked young in one way and old in another. His head—” she made a shiver that started at her scalp and went down. “I don’t know. He was bald but not shaved. Like the hair gave up. He smelled like hospitals and rain.”

“Which way did he go?”

“Toward Mill Street.” Gale’s mouth tightened. “I should’ve followed. I’m not made of glass.”

“No,” said Alex. “You did right. You called it in.” She looked around. “Show me the room.”

Inside the salvage office— which was really three rooms with walls that had learned to lean— the broken door lay like a tongue on the concrete floor. Shelves had cascaded. Old letters, the metal kind you used to slide into signs, had spelt themselves into gibberish. A barber pole lay in long hotdog stripes of red and white. Alex’s lamp went over everything, slow. She stopped at a smudge on the floor that could have been oil and could have been anything. She saw, in the dust on the steel shelf, four long prints like a hand had rested there without any of the pads. It made her think of skeletons, x-rays, the way people are made of lines under their skin.

“He leave anything?” she asked.

Gale half laughed. “I’ll tell you what he didn’t leave,” she said. “He took the jar. He took the jar and that— that old popcorn machine that I was going to fix, if we’re telling the truth. He lifted it like it was a purse.”

“Popcorn machine.”

“You’re not going to make sense of it,” Gale warned, like a friend. “He just… he took it. Maybe he’ll sell it. Maybe whatever that jar is, he thought it would look good next to a carnival red. There’s no why that will help you.”

Alex stepped around and squatted. Her own knees creaked and she thought of her father teasing her the year she started cycling seriously. Those bikes, he’d say, with derision for the very idea of a thing that made you happy. Everything’s a phase. He hadn’t been to the last big race. He hadn’t seen her finish with the pack or carry that finish inside her like a little gold coin for weeks afterward. He called her when he needed help moving the snowblower. He called her when the pipes knocked, when the cable went out, when her mother picked fights and then sat tearful in the laundry room on the dryer like it was a boat. He’d stop mid-sentence and say, It’s a waste, what you did, could have been something. She could still hear: Could have been a detective in a big city. Could have been.

Now she took a breath and let it out. That breath was a floor you built in the air and stood on. Outside, the canal moved like a lung.

Gale said, “You going to catch him?”

“I’m going to find him,” Alex said. “He’s not a ghost.”

Gale snorted. “That’s funny. Felt like.”

“Ghosts don’t laugh,” Alex said, and then she had to correct herself: “Not like that. Did he say anything?”

“He sang,” Gale said slowly, surprised at the memory as she said it. “Not words. You know when a kid makes a song to themselves while they color and it doesn’t make any sense to anybody but their brain? He sang like that. Standing there with those— with that jar. It was— it was not what I expected to remember, but there it is.”

When Alex left Gale writing the incident report with hands rock-steady the way old sailors tie knots in weather because someone has to, she thought about going home. She thought about unsnapping the radio and putting it back into the dish with the badge and that little brass coin she had carried in her pocket since the day she finally let herself get sober. She thought, too, of Eddie’s face turned to the dark and of the door to the salvage room propped against itself like a promise or a warning. She touched the bell on her bicycle handlebar without ringing it. Then she turned east, toward Mill Street.

On the way, the alleys tucked behind the car lots exhaled heat, and the paper factory had that sweet-bitter smell that made tourists wrinkle their noses and locals say, It’s the smell of money. The giant was not there. The giant was not anywhere when you looked straight at him. But you could feel where he’d been the way you can feel where a friend sat on your couch hours later, a little sinking of cushions, a warmth that has no source anymore.

At the bridge she stopped again because the river made her and because a figure stood with his back to her, big enough to be what she was thinking of and yet not impossibly large, a man who had been handsome if you liked the long edges of hands and the way a neck holds a head. He leaned toward the water like he was considering whether to put his face in it.

“Hey,” she said, because it was dangerous to creep up on anybody, not least people who lived inside their own storms. “You need help?”

He turned with a deliberation that said he knew she was there all along. He was not as tall as the word giant suggests. He was that other kind of giant, the kind that removes him from furniture, makes him a problem in houses, makes the world too tight a shoe. His eyes were small under a brow that cast shadow like a ledge. His cheeks were hollow. His mouth— she had never thought the words was it gentle? about a mouth before, but she did now. He held something at his side, cradled. The lamp of her bike picked up the curve of glass. His hands dwarfed it. The lid had that bell shape. Inside, cloudy liquid. Shapes instead of fingers.

“Do you?” he asked, in a voice that should have belonged to a smaller man.

“I’m okay,” she said. “You look far from home.”

His smile came and went, a cloud shadow across a yard. “Home is a chair I broke,” he said. “It’s a freezer with nothing in it. It’s a backyard where no one plays. Do you ride that thing everywhere?”

“All the places I can,” she said. “I’m Alex.”

He nodded like a boy being introduced to a teacher he had already heard about. “I’m Jakob.”

She almost said, Without a last name? and then felt how that would be to say. She said nothing. The river made its sound, the never-not-saying. Jets crossed and did not explode. The whole city was a body breathing. She felt that.

“I have to take you in,” she said, and heard how absurd that sounded on a night like this. In a conversation like this. But there it was. “People are scared.”

“They laugh,” he said. Not a question, not an accusation, a fact he was placing between them like another jar. “They laugh until they cry. They forget to be mean. For a minute. For a minute they are only bodies making music.”

“That’s not for you to do,” she said. She could hear her mother saying, Don’t tell people what is and isn’t theirs. But this, here, was hers. “That’s not yours.”

He looked out at the water. “It used to be my nephew’s,” he said, and when he said nephew the muscle in his jaw pinched. “He laughed when he shouldn’t have. He laughed when it was the wrong time. He laughed when they put the IV in. He laughed because it hurt and because he didn’t want me to be scared. He laughed and then he was quiet and then there was no noise in the world but machines. I think a person should be allowed to choose the last sound they hear, but that’s not how it works. So now I go and give them laughter first, before somebody else takes it away. I take something in return so I can remember what I did. I am not as clever as I sound,” he added, a sudden nakedness to that line that made her blink. “I am making rules after the fact. I am living in the airport of grief.”

“Where’s your sister?” Alex asked because sometimes you take people to where the bleed began and sometimes you don’t know you’ve done it until you’re standing in the room.

“Sleeping in a chair,” he said. “Her boys— the one and then the next— she had them like coins you keep flipping to see if luck is on your side, and then the trick failed. She never believed in medicine. She told me if I had been there—” He stopped. “I was there,” he said, softer.

“You can’t hurt people and call it a gift,” she said. “You know that.”

“They heal,” he said so quick she knew he’d practiced that line in his head. “I say their names when I fold the bandages. I say, Remember how you laughed. Remember how long it went on. Remember that when you need to.”

“You put their… their—” she couldn’t find a word that wasn’t wrong “—in a jar.”

Jakob’s face was very quiet. “Not all of them,” he said. “Just a few. They are a chorus of the boys I have lost. There are boys who are mine and boys who never were. They are mine, too. The city is mine. I can lift it. I can put my hands under it and make the bank not flood. I can— I’m sorry. I say things.” He smiled again, a helpless show of teeth. It was not frightening. It made something in her chest ache with a very old, very simple ache, the way an adult looks at any other adult and says, We are children acting like we know how to live.

“What if they don’t want to laugh?” she asked.

“Everybody wants to laugh,” he said. Then his expression shifted as if a cloud crossed something behind his face. “Except you,” he said. “You stopped.”

“I laugh,” she said defensively, and thought of the last real laugh, when? Not the polite ones, not the in-the-office ones, the ones that made her eyes wet and her ribs hurt. She thought of a November day on the bike when a dog had chased her for two blocks with such joy that he forgot to turn back, and his owner had laughed and waved, and she had laughed, too, at the foolish earnest beauty of the chase. She could not think of a date. She felt that like a cold coin in her hand.

Jakob lifted the jar. “You can’t take me in,” he said. “I don’t fit places. I am an outside thing.”

“We build places,” she said, “for big things. We make room.”

He looked at her bike. “You use your legs,” he said. “You and my nephew. He pedaled like the world was a friend and a road at once. He laughed on hills. He laughed when he fell and he laughed when he won and he laughed when he lost. He kept laughing when his hair stuck to the sweat on his head. He said, ‘Jakob, you should try it. It would make your legs into oak trees.’ He liked trees.”

“What was his name?” she asked.

He stood, actually stood, like he had been half turned to her from something else and now he faced fully. “Isaiah,” he said. He put his hand, not the one with the jar, to the middle of his own chest and made a slow pressing motion. “Isaiah,” he said again, as if tasting the syllables was a thing he allowed himself only sometimes. He looked like somebody who lived in a story with rules that he alone understood and this moment here next to the canal wasn’t in it.

She did not reach for him. She did not take a step back either. She did a very hard thing that inside her training had a name and outside it did not: she stood still. She let her body make the case.

“Come with me,” she said quietly. “Sit down at the station. You can say everything you want. People will hear what you really believe you are doing. But you have to stop touching people. You have to give me that. No more. No more jars.”

He put his face in his hand like she had thrown a handful of sand into it. “No more jars,” he repeated, as if the words were a bench he had found he was allowed to sit on. “No more jars,” he said again, and then some other part of him remembered itself and he straightened. “I will put it down,” he said. “But not yet. I promised someone. I promised Isaiah. I promised he would be—”

He did not finish. He popped up, if a big man can be said to pop, the movement so sudden that the water seemed to notice, and then he was past her. He was precise, a courtesy in his avoidance of her shoulder, an awareness of the bike. He loped. There is a gait some giant men develop to keep from frightening people with their pace; he did not have it yet. He ran like an animal that had not been made to live in a city and wanted to get home. After three strides he dissolved into the dark of the path toward the factories, and she tried to follow but the bike couldn’t turn fast enough and by the time she clipped in he was gone.

She rode till the chain sang and then rode until it fell quiet. She cruised the streets where she knew the kids cut through from party to party, where the ash trees grew like they were trying to imitate the pictures of Italian roads. She listened for odd laughter and heard only the kind people do when they have had beer. She rolled through downtown and past the bowling alley with the neon ball forever flirting with the neon pins. She circled back to her building only when the radio did the little cough that meant the dispatcher was clearing her throat to ask if she was still breathing without putting it on the air.

Inside her apartment the fern had curled overnight into a little fist. Plants told you what you ignored. She watered it until the soil sighed greedily and then she turned her phone over. Nine missed calls from her father. Two from her sister.

She sat on the kitchen floor with her back against the cupboards and called her father, because one thing she knew about respect was that it was an animal that you fed even when it bit you. He picked up on the second ring and said, “So now you remember you got a family.”

“I was working,” she said.

“You were biking,” he said. In the background, the familiar television voice of the late-night weatherman like an uncle you didn’t like but had to invite if you had other relatives over. “Someone called me from the church and said they saw you blast past like you were in the Tour de France.”

“Dad.”

He was silent in the way he did when he was loading his next line into a slingshot. “Your mother went to Leah’s,” he said. “They’re having that— just say you’ll come on Sunday. Say you’ll be at the table for once. Your niece wants to show you the thing she learned on the recorder, God help us all.”

“I might be working.”

“She’ll forgive you if you come smelling like work,” he said, doggedly hopeful. “You need to let the family forgive you. I’m tired of you doing it wrong. Come to the table. We’ll make room for the bicycle in the hall. I’ll move the snowblower, if that’s what it takes.”

“Okay,” she said, because arguing was a way to get the body to feel like it had done something without any of the doing. “Sunday.” Her eyes went to the dish with the coin and the badge. Her hand went to the radio unthinking and then stopped.

“What was the call?” her father asked, trying for casual and failing. “You’re not supposed to tell me, but you tell me. That’s our deal.”

“No deal,” she said. “And you don’t want to know. It’s strange.”

“Strange is worse than bad,” he said.

“I know.”

“You all right?” He softened. There he was, the man who had taught her to let go of the handlebars on a straightaway and trust her own balance. The man who had told her not to let the hill have the last word.

She looked at the blank window where her reflection sat like a woman she might meet at a bus stop and think, You have the same eyes as me. “I’m all right,” she said, and found that it felt like describing a dream where her mouth would not work right.

That night she dreamt a jar in which snow fell and never reached the ground.

Morning arrived like the polite guest it is in spring, knocking, and she took it in. The street smelled like bread from the bakery and the river like tin. At the station, the whiteboard bloomed with new colors because some bright deputy always took the night shift as an excuse to use the markers like a bouquet. Reports on the board: Gale’s Salvage, 2330 hours. Disruption. Witness describes large male, possible mental health crisis. Then: Incident at Webster Park, 1900 hours, juvenile complaint — tickling. The word tickling on a police board looked like a toy fell into a drawer full of knives.

“Sergeant,” said Parnell, saluting with his coffee. “You were out late. We caught you on the bridge camera with Big Baby.”

“You’re not calling him that,” she said.

Parnell shrugged. “What should we call him?”

“His name is Jakob,” she said, hearing herself and knowing that something like care had slipped out and wanting to pull it back and fold it into a drawer.

Chief Patterson came heavy-footed out of her office and stopped at the board with her mug raised like she could shame the dry-erase into coherence. She was younger than people thought a chief should be and made up for it by dressing like the geometry teacher who terrified you into good math. She turned. “Moran,” she said. “Run me through it.”

Alex ran them through it. The laugh on the water. The boy under the stairs. The salvage yard. The bridge. She did not tell them what Jakob said about Isaiah, because some things you say only to the person you said them to first, and to put them into a room full of radios and a camera mounted in the corner would be to shrink them into something that would break if you looked at it.

“Hands in a jar,” Patterson said, flat. “Christ.”

“We haven’t got the hands,” Parnell said. “We’ve got Gale saying what she saw in poor light and two kids reporting that a big guy jumped them and tickled them. They’ve got bruises on their ribs from laughing, for crying out loud. This is insane.”

“The hands are the part that makes it not insane,” Alex said, and they looked at her. “That means there’s evidence. That means there are victims who need us. We also have security footage, if the bridge camera caught anything.”

“It caught you,” Parnell said. “Him in silhouette. You can tell he’s carrying something. The glass flashes. He moves like he doesn’t want his shadow to step on anything.”

“That’s not useful,” Patterson muttered, but she was the one to say “Let’s see it then,” and stood shoulder to shoulder with everyone else in the little room that smelled forever of old coffee, new paper, and the heat of machines.

On the camera he was younger than she’d thought and older, both, because the camera is cruel. He stepped out of the lock of shadow at the bridge’s arch and into the light like a man who knows people need to see him to believe him. The jar glowed. He glanced toward the water as if someone had called him by name. His head moved then, cocked the way a person does when they’re listening to something they want to pretend they can’t hear. He turned toward where Alex stood much too near. You could see their mouths make shapes that the camera could not hear. You could see the thing in his face that wasn’t hate, and that was somehow worse.

“He didn’t hurt you,” Patterson said. It wasn’t a question.

“No,” Alex said. “Not for lack of size. He’s very sure of himself.”

“He made a choice,” Patterson said. “Don’t confuse that with a gift.”

“I don’t.”

“Good.” Patterson’s eyes softened enough that Alex could say yes, this is why she took the job, for bosses who could be both. “So you’re going to be our point on this. Parnell, you back her up. Keep an eye on the parks. Alert guidance counselors, in case he shows up outside a school. It’s warm weather. Kids are going to be out later. Parents are going to be on Facebook asking if this is the end of days. We say no and we keep patrols visible. Alex?”

“Yes.”

“You said he said his name. You said he said it just Jakob. We run that. We talk to hospitals, shelters, anyone who might know big men named Jakob who stand too close to the water. If he’s grieving, there’ll be a paper trail, somewhere. Death records. Uncles. Aunties. The last name will be on that.”

Alex nodded. She thought again of his voice saying the soft Isaiah. She could imagine him under a different name too, as if he were walking away from syllables the way a kid walks away from a house that had too many shouting rooms and makes a new name in his mouth just to have a place no one else can get into.

Her sister texted around noon, a photo of her niece’s hamster with a crocheted hat on, as if that could be a bridge across whatever river had opened between them years ago; Alex sent back three hearts and a bicycle emoji, stupid, then regretted the emoji, then put the phone face down and gave herself the task of calling every ER in a forty-mile radius. “Have you had anyone come in with—” she said. She found words that made the receptionists not hang up. She listened to the emotion like static on the other end.

In the afternoon, she took the bike and went to talk to kids because kids told the truth if you made enough room for it. At Webster Park the older teenagers moved like a flock, all of them burning with a private joke, and she asked whether they knew anyone who had seen the man who tickled, and they laughed like it was a dare and then stopped when they saw she wasn’t laughing. In a sweet dead patch of trees where somebody hung old CDs so the sun would dazzle like fish scales, a girl with a white bandage across her forearm talked about an encounter with a big man who held her in the inside of his arm the way you hold a cat you don’t want to scratch you and laughed into her hair, not mean, but not kind either, almost like he wanted her to match him. “It made me think of the dentist,” she said. “He talked to me the whole time. He told me to tell him when it hurt and then he told me I was doing great when I said it didn’t. He wanted to be the person who helped me with the hurt he was giving me. That’s wrong, right?” She was fourteen going on forty, her eyes a tint that made Alex think of cold lakes, and Alex said, “It’s wrong,” and felt it in her throat.

At dusk, she rode the ridge that runs behind the church with the bad mural of Jesus in sneakers. She stopped at the community garden where the soil still smelled of last year’s onions. She stood there, and a man in a straw hat said, “You looking for the big guy?” and Alex said, “Always,” and the man laughed and said, “Aren’t we all,” and she had to laugh, too, because sometimes the city gives you a joke you didn’t know you needed.

Back home, she cleaned her chain until it shone. She set her helmet on the table and then, because she was tired enough to be honest with herself, she took the brass coin out of the dish and rubbed her thumb over the stamped Latin, not because she believed in the saying but because the coin had weight. She stood at the window and the glass became a mirror and she met the other Alex again, the one she talked to without anyone hearing, the one who might be more yourself than the one who answered the phone.

We’ll get him, she said to the other Alex. We’ll get him and still be ourselves after.

The other Alex raised one dark eyebrow as if that was the funny part of all of this.

In another part of the same city, in a storage unit that was just a metal room with a door like a guillotine, Jakob kneeled on the concrete in that careful way big men do when they don’t want to crack the earth. He set the jar down in the square of light from the corridor. He put both hands on the sides, tender as if he could lift it without touching it.

“Isaiah,” he said, and his voice barely made a sound. “I will not make a new jar,” he said, and the words trembled because he wanted to and because not-wanting and wanting can live upstairs in the same head and never meet. He reached under the tarp for the popcorn machine and smiled to see the old red enamel. He spun the crank and the kettle rattled. He watched the little flaps wag. In his head the sound of corn becoming itself again, old magic, and he thought of the boy he had met on the bridge who had not wanted to be saved so much as looked at. There are different kinds of saving. He knew that now.

He closed the unit and the door snicked down and the lock slid through like a tongue back into a mouth. In the corridor the lights flashed automatic as he moved, bright, dark, bright. He threw a shadow that looked like something the city didn’t make. He went out into the evening, where gulls were still trying to make a living in a town that had stopped throwing bread.

Sunday came. Alex sat at her sister’s table with her wet hair making a cold stripe on the back of her neck because she had ridden there, because she always rode where she could, and the niece played Mary Had a Little Lamb with something like malice and Alex said, “That’s wonderful,” and her father said, “You smell like outside,” which was the kindest thing he could think to call it, and her mother brought too much potato salad and pretended it was a reasonable amount. They talked around it, the whole family, the car that climbed up out of the canal on the tow truck the week before, the man who had tried to sell lightbulbs door to door, the woman whose child had been accepted to a college half the country away and who cried in the produce aisle. They didn’t talk about the giant. They didn’t talk about the jars.

After, she washed dishes with her mother while the others argued about the mouse that had been seen by the pantry. Her mother said, like she was testing a line: “I heard you’re chasing something big.”

“I am,” Alex said simply.

“Are you?” Her mother rinsed a plate, set it dripping in the rack. “Or are you running from something big?”

Alex almost had a joke. She didn’t use it. “I think,” she said, “that I am finally going toward something. It scares me. But I get to be the one who’s scared. Not other people.”

Her mother’s hand touched the back of her neck where the hair had dried in a small curl. It was a gesture that belonged to the past, to hairbrushes and afternoons and the smell of soup. “Good,” her mother said. “You always were the one who went toward. Even when it burned you.”

Alex nodded. Her hands in the dishwater looked like they belonged to a farmer. She liked that. She liked her hands.

When she rode home, the city lifted itself around her like a dog startled and then settling. People sat on stoops and watched the evening darken. A man fried fish on his porch and the smell reached out invitations. A girl tried to do a wheelie and nearly fell and then caught herself and laughed, really laughed, the kind that lifts up the moment and shakes it and all the dust flies off and you can see the colors again. Alex laughed back because sometimes the body remembers without your help. It felt like a coin melting in her hand and taking a new shape.

She didn’t see Jakob that night. She didn’t see him the next. She saw the signs of him, the where he’d been, the scraped paint on a fence where he’d stepped over, the way a bench had moved inches, the bits of popped kernels someone had thrown into the canal like confetti. The kids were faster. He was changing his schedule. He was a tide and she was a shore and sometimes they touched.

It would not be all chase. It would not be all talk. She could feel the shape of the thing ahead the way you feel the shape of a hill in your legs before your eyes. She stretched. She checked her chain. She filled out the paperwork. She listened to Gale talk about the way the jar had reflected her own face. She promised Eddie that she’d call him if there were arrests so he could sleep. She did not yet tell her family. They would find out in the way families do: through the person who talks to the person who talks to the person until the story arrives at the table wearing a different hat and everybody pretends they knew all along.

Night. The canal with its half-moon bent in the water like a spoon. The city humming its long hum. The bicycle leaning against her wall like a patient creature.

She stood at the window and whispered to the other Alex, who for once did not raise an eyebrow. Soon, she said. We go. We stop him. We see what we’re made of with our hands out in front of us, empty, ready. The air smelled of rain and metal and something that might have been popcorn, and she thought, for once, that maybe she would sleep and dream something not like a jar, but like a road.Morning came with rain slanting like handwriting across the glass, and Alex took it as a note she could read. Fulton’s rain wasn’t dramatic; it didn’t grab you by the collar and drag you into a culvert. It persisted. It made lanes of the towpath into two different worlds, one for the regulars and one for the puddle jumpers. She rode to a basement where coffee always turned out weak no matter who made it and chairs had been lined up into a horseshoe that fit, just barely, the number of people who happened to be human together that hour. The rug was the color of rain, the kind that lives in fabric. On the wall a poster said things about serenity in fonts that did not deserve to carry ideas as heavy as these, and a man with a ponytail and a face like a closed fist told a story about laughter and funerals that made everyone make that sound that isn’t quite a laugh and isn’t quite a sob, the group noise of recognizing a thing.

When it was her turn she didn’t say anything about giants or jars or being tickled. She talked about the way her hands would shake when she dried them sometimes, not from wanting a drink but from the body missing the tiny ritual of the glass, the clink, the lift, the way we build scaffolds out of nonsense. People nodded. There was mercy in the room for things that didn’t make sense yet. She looked at her thumb rubbing the coin and thought about how often you get to choose a next time and how often life grabs that from you and says, Here, you get this time and no more. A woman with neat braids pressed a small square of paper purloined from some brochure into her hand when it ended, with a name and a number and the word sponsor written like it was a password. Alex tucked it into her wallet behind her license so she’d have to see it when she reached for official versions of herself.

At the station the day was a little drunk on coffee and rain. Parnell had an umbrella that said a bank name on it in a font that wanted to be serious and couldn’t. He spun it idly and it knocked his stapler off his desk and he didn’t comment; he’d long ago learned that the station didn’t respect your possessions. Patterson had traded her heels for flats and looked annoyed at feet in general, hers specifically. Calls came and went like birds in bad weather.

“Hospital phoned in,” Parnell said midmorning, covering the mouth of his mug with one hand as if it were a thing that could evaporate if the air touched it. He had a habit of delivering bad news like someone reading a grocery list. “Disturbance in peds. Not a code, more like a flurry. Tall male. Security says gentle voice and crazy eyes. Staff says he didn’t touch anyone. They say he laughed. This is our boy. You want me?”

“I want you,” Alex said because there were days when she needed a second to keep her from thinking too large and too sad all at once. They rolled with the quiet urgency that a rainy day grants you, sirens off, wipers keeping their own time.

The hospital had dressed itself in murals that tried to convince children that lobbies could be meadows, that elevators were mountains you could climb by pressing a button. Even the smell tried hard, sugary under the disinfectant, as if it could drown out the metal undercurrent that said, Machines live here. Security met them with faces arranged for both cooperation and offense, the way guards always look when they know cops will want footage and to tell them how to do their job. A nurse whose badge said Delilah stood a little apart, arms folded like she had wrapped herself in herself and it would keep her from shivering. The sleeves of her sweater had little pills like hailstones.

“He came in humming,” Delilah said, and her voice had that careful ICU softness that belongs to people who daily bend over sleepers and decide what volume mercy is. “Not singing really. A tune without a tune. No mask. He’d be a terrible bank robber. Too memorable. He went to the board—” she gestured to the wall where kids’ names hung in laminated stars “—and he touched three of them. Just his fingertips. I told him he couldn’t do that. He apologized like he meant it, and then he asked, ‘Which of these are the funny ones?’ I said we don’t call kids that, and he said no, the ones who still have it. He said it like ‘it’ wasn’t laughter but a kind of light. He moved like he belonged, which is how people get away with anything they want to.”

“Did he lay hands on anybody?” Alex asked, and felt the complicated way in which that phrase lived in this building.

Delilah’s mouth made that half-smile people make when the question doesn’t deserve a smile and gets one anyway because you need to soften the sharpness. “He didn’t touch them,” she said. “He touched their laughter. He told jokes that weren’t jokes. He put his hands near their ribs and said, ‘Remember how to do this,’ and some of them did, and some didn’t because they were too tired, and he cried when they didn’t, and that was when I wanted to call you because a man that size crying in peds is either a miracle or a problem and I’m not in the mood for miracles right now.”

“Did he leave anything?” Alex kept her voice like Delilah’s, like hospital air.

Delilah shifted. She looked at the floor as if something had spilled there and she was responsible. “He left a jar in the family room. I didn’t look inside. I saw the lid and thought, That’s for cookies, and then I saw the way the light made the glass bend, and I thought, That’s not for cookies. We moved families out. Security is glaring at it like glare is acid. Can you—” she stopped and started again because professionalism came with rules about how you asked for favors “—can you take it away.”

Security had cordoned off the small room with a ribbon in a color cheerful enough to cover its purpose. Everything in the family room was designed to be touched and sat upon, wiped clean and touched again, the surfaces saying We know about crisis and we also know about markers. The jar sat on a low table meant for board games, which made it worse because some part of Alex had learned to expect that harm would live on altars, not on furniture shaped like a promise of ordinary. The glass had a swell to it, the belly of it generous, the lid shaped like a bell with a glass handle like a little phony jewel. Inside, cloudy liquid made its own weather. Things floated the way drowned leaves float, with an arrogance born of being beyond what weight wants.

She did not kneel the way Jakob had on the storage unit floor. She did not lean hard away from it either. She stood in the doorway and let the fact of it be what it was; she let her eyes take in what Gale had said and the way Gale had said it and decide whether her body would betray her. The shapes had fingernails and knuckles and tiny crescents of callus where a pencil had rested, and if you told her later that they were made of wax she would refuse that mercy because she saw the half-moons of dirt under gnawed cuticles that belonged only to people who had been alive. The water or whatever liquid it was bent the light so that the hands seemed to take themselves apart at the wrists and reassemble, as if trying different choices in a game whose rules had been written elsewhere. Parnell cussed softly behind her and then covered it with a cough that fooled no one.

“Chain of custody,” he said a second later, contrition and procedure arriving together like two kids who can’t help but be friends.

“Call CSU and ask them to bring a heavy case and their stomachs,” Alex said. “Tell them lab will get a treat today.” Her voice, some part of her observed, sounded exactly like the voice of a woman who has had a jar of small hands placed in her day before. It sounded like this was the town she lived in and not someone else’s story.

Delilah didn’t come into the room. She held onto the doorjamb like someone bracing for weather. “Is there a law,” she asked quietly, “for whatever this is.”

“There’s a law for touching people without their permission,” Alex said. “There’s a law for messing with a crime scene. There are so many laws that we might forget what we started with, which is a person who has decided that he knows what someone else needs.”

Delilah’s eyes glittered. If she had not been at work she would have cried more openly. “We have a wall,” she said, gesturing to a hallway where photographs of children smiled in that specific way hospital kids learn to smile, wide enough to reassure their parents, contained enough to conserve energy. “We have a wall with names and dates and donors’ plaques, beautiful plaques, the kind of brass that will still shine after the world ends. We put grief on walls because we need something to do with our hands. He took it home and put it in a jar. I can’t bear that. I can’t bear those two truths living in the same city.”

Alex reached for the coin in her pocket and found it and did nothing with it. “Sometimes not bearing is a luxury,” she said, and then she wanted to take the words back and fold them into a more useful shape. “We’re going to stop him. That’s useful.”

When CSU came, they came with boxes that made them look like a catering service for a party you would never want to attend. The tech in charge, a woman named McGlinn who wore her mask under her chin because the lab was always an exception, did not say anything sentimental. She said “Prints” like it was a catechism, and then “Fluid,” and then “Temperature,” and when she bent to peer into the jar she made the same tiny sound people make when they find their car dented in the parking lot and no note left; not outrage, exactly, the almost-laugh of disbelief that the universe contains both the existence of your car and the possibility of its denting.

“Where do you want it?” she asked Alex. The jar sat between them like a third person none of them had invited.

“In the lab,” Alex said. “In the lab and then in court and then in sentences that put him in a place where rooms can hold him, if such places exist.”

They watched the jar go away under a crisp white drape like a body. Delilah finally allowed herself to lean into the doorjamb with her forehead and breathe. Parnell put his hand on Alex’s shoulder without comment. His hand felt like the weight of an old book.

On the way out, Alex stopped at the board where the stars had names. Isaiah was there, neat as a prayer written by a careful hand. There were four Isaiahs on the wall because names come in clusters like berries, in good years and bad. One of them had a sticker next to his star that said Ring the Bell!, the exclamation point trying too hard and succeeding anyway. She touched none of them. She tried to imagine being the man who walked up and pressed his fingertip to paper as if it were skin. She could not. She could imagine, barely, the way grief makes a person try every door even when you can see that there is no house attached to the frame.

“Visitor logs,” she said to Parnell quietly as a nurse walked by with a stack of blankets that burst into a smell of hot cotton that was heartbreak itself. “Isaiah is on hospice. He has an aunt. He has an uncle. If Jakob came here, he signed somewhere, even if it was a fake. We start with the ones who make sense. We’re not going to find him by looking in the places that don’t exist.”

The volunteer at the desk was the kind of older woman who had turned competence into an art; she had a way of sliding binders toward them like she was dealing cards in a game where everyone deserved a decent hand. She said she shouldn’t, and then she did. The pages smelled faintly of hand sanitizer and many fingers. They found an entry from two weeks ago for Isaiah M.— the last initial had been left in on purpose on this copy, because privacy laws didn’t bow easily even to cops — with visitors Barbara, Leonard, and Jakob with a K, no last name. The handwriting wobbled like someone had been thinking about something other than writing, or like a person whose hands were too large for small motions. There was a tiny smear of grease on the line, as if this man had touched his head to think and oil had come off the scalp.

“K is useful,” Parnell murmured. “Jakob with a K. Europeans. I got three cousins at the tire plant named that.”

“Or a mother who liked the way the letter looks,” Alex said. “Do you want to run the Isaiahs with uncles named Jakob through obits or do you want me to do it.”

“I’ll do the obits,” he said gamely. “You go get coffee and text three therapists. You look like a fish out of water in a way that is alarming.”

She didn’t go get coffee. She went to the wall where donors’ names lived. People forget that walls like that tell stories. She found M— Family Fund in gold siblings to the other names. Next to it someone had taped a drawing of a bicycle that had exactly five spokes on each wheel, because the artist knew a bike from life but not from math. The name underneath was Isaiah and a date with months and years and a little heart drawn between, like you might draw on your own wrist to keep yourself from doing harm. She took a photograph of it with her phone and then she put her phone face down on the counter because some things you don’t want sending your face back to you.

By late afternoon, Parnell stood in the doorway of her office holding two printouts like they were good fish he’d caught in a stream he didn’t believe in. “Isaiah Morales,” he said. “Eleven. Went in and out three times with leukemia. Uncle listed on the online fundraiser is Jakob Kral. No kidding. Kral. Sister is Barbara Kral now Morales by marriage. Address on Thayer that the city never really decided whether to fix. You want to take it.”

“I want to take it,” she said, and looked at the rain, which had become more like a mist, a suggestion that if you wanted to have the day back you could, if you had a bucket big enough.

Thayer was one of those streets that legislatures forget when budgets get penned, full of houses that didn’t used to be single-family and still weren’t, exactly, families moving through like weather, some good, some bad, all of them carrying groceries and grief. The Morales house had a porch that sagged in that brave way porches do when they love you too much to fall. A grill hulked like a dinosaur waiting for spring.

Barbara opened the door with a towel thrown over her shoulder like a boxer and the look on her face that said she had made her kitchen into a fortress and you could come in if you checked your weapons with her. She saw the badge and then saw the woman holding it and you could see her decide to keep the door open even wider. Inside, something sizzled like onions considering their choices. A television in the front room spoke Spanish to itself.

“You’re late,” Barbara said, and Alex felt something in her chest loosen, because there was relief in meeting someone who wasn’t going to pretend. Barbara had the Morales mouth, wide and quick to curve. Her eyes were tired in a way that had nothing to do with sleep and everything to do with keeping the kinds of hours your heart doesn’t like. “Come in,” she said. “Take your shoes off. My nephew would kill me if you tracked in dirt and he showed up to check my baseboards. And don’t say I shouldn’t joke. If I don’t, I turn into salt.”

The kitchen was full of smells that meant a house still tried to be a house. A boy who wasn’t Isaiah, maybe seven, did a homework page with more eraser smudges than words and glared at the paper like it had insulted his mother. A teenage girl stirred a pot with a ferocity that said stirring was the only thing keeping her from flinging herself at the world. On the fridge, drawings held up by magnets that had come free of their plastic shapes long ago, silver circles without friends. A photograph of a tall man with his arm casually draped over a boy’s shoulders like he believed the future was a solid thing you could lean on.

“Jakob is a good man,” Barbara said, and you could hear the sound of someone walking across a floor to stand between a person and something large that wanted to grind them down. “He is foolish and he is a bull in a glass store and he thinks sorrow is a job like making shoes. But he is a good man.”

“He broke into a business and took a jar with hands inside it,” Alex said softly. “He held teenagers by the ribs until they laughed hard enough to bruise. He came into your very nice hospital and asked for the funny ones.”

Barbara closed her eyes and then opened them with a tiny shake of her head like a horse clearing flies. “He came here when my boy went in,” she said. “He slept on my porch because he didn’t trust himself to be inside where there are bottles and men who say things. He carried Isaiah to the car even when he didn’t need to be carried. He took the tram with us and pretended to be scared so Isaiah could laugh and say, ‘It’s not scary, Uncle, it’s just a machine that goes up,’ and then when it was scary he said, ‘I guess it is the tiniest bit scary,’ and Isaiah laughed again. When we cut Isaiah’s hair we did it in the yard and everyone came over and my brother made jokes that were so bad people had to laugh because there was no other way to make them die. And then he stood in my kitchen and put his head on the cabinet and shook and I thought the house would fall. What do you want me to do with that, Sergeant. Where do you want me to put it. On which shelf.”

“I want to know where he is,” Alex said, and the honesty felt like setting a heavy object down on a counter that could take it. “I want to talk to him in a place where I can close the door. I want to tell him that he can’t touch the kids because he makes the world smaller when he does. I want to take the jar to a lab and prove that the hands belong to someone who should be buried whole. I want to stop seeing bruises shaped like laughter.”

Barbara leaned her knuckles into the table and looked at a spot on the wood like it had a thing to say. “He hates the river,” she said finally. “He loves it, and he hates it. He used to swim in it when we were little and our mother would say, ‘You’re going to grow gills,’ and he would say, ‘Good, I want to be a fish,’ and then he saw a boy get pulled out of it one summer and he didn’t go back in up to his knees. He goes to it when he doesn’t know where else to go because it talks like our father did when he was in his good mood. He hates the storage units on Irving because they smell like money he doesn’t have. He goes there anyway because he thinks it counts as a home to pay for space. He thinks if he puts his grief in a room he can close the door and act like a person. He is simple in that way. If he told you ‘no more jars’ he meant it until the minute came where his stupid hands did what they want.”

“Storage units on Irving,” Alex said. It didn’t surprise her. There are only so many rooms a city offers a person the size of grief. “Do you have a key.”

Barbara snorted wetly. “Do I look like the person he gives keys to. He gives keys to men who sell him a truck that isn’t good and to friends on nights that go badly. He gives me bags of oranges because the girls at work told him oranges make you well. He gives me his shoes when he buys the wrong size. He does not give me keys. If you ask the guy in the office, he’ll say he doesn’t know anything about anyone, and then his face will say he knows everything and it is eating him.”

Alex stood too so she would be at Barbara’s height and could see the work the muscles in her face were doing. “If I promise you I won’t shoot him unless he leaves me no choice, will you call him and tell him that the woman on the bike he talked to wants to meet him somewhere where the river can hear. Not to trap him. To fix what pieces we can fix.”

Barbara laughed without wanting to and then did it again, a cough that let something loose. “You think you can fix this, and I both love and hate you for it,” she said. “I will call him,” she added, and reached for her phone like it was the last piece of the house that still remembered how to be a house. “He won’t answer, but he will hear it in his pocket. He will feel his leg buzz and he will be proud that he remembers to charge it even though the men at the unit say not to plug things in because of fires. He will go stand under the bridge because he is dramatic and because he likes the way voices sound there. You better be the kind of person you sounded like on the phone in your pocket when you talked to him at the river. He listens to sounds more than he listens to words.”

They arranged a time that was not a time because men like Jakob do not meet at times. It was a light; it was when the streetlamps blink awake and everyone has the moment where they think, It is later, and then proceed anyway. Barbara would call again at that hour and say into the machine, “The woman is there,” and then she would hang up and try to keep herself from making a hole in her own floor with her walking.

On the way out, the little boy looked up at Alex and said, very solemn, “My uncle could pick up a car but he shouldn’t,” and Alex said, “I agree completely,” and the boy nodded and went back to trying to make the letter S behave on paper.

They stopped first at Irving because sometimes you put the thing you want next to the thing you know you haven’t earned yet. The manager had a mustache that had made decisions many years ago and was sticking with them. He wore a T-shirt with a cartoon lock on it that asked the viewer if their stuff was safe enough. He said he didn’t know their tenants and wouldn’t even if they stood in front of him holding their own faces. He said it with dignity and then with a crack. When Alex walked him to the row with the units that smelled faintly of sugar because somebody on the third door down always had something cooking, he said he knew a Jakob who came in late nights and never bothered anyone and had sad eyes like a dog you put outside and then decide to bring back in. He looked at her badge as if it might be contagious.

“I need to see the unit,” she said in the voice that says, I can get the paper if you make me, but we both don’t want that.

He gave them the number and the kind of key you get at the end of a chain when you don’t want to trust that people won’t copy them. The door rolled up with a clatter like a trap going up instead of down. Inside it was tidy in the way big men keep small spaces, everything massive pushed hard to the edges so the middle holds. Under a tarp the size of a tent an unmistakable machine gleamed red where the dust had not found it. The popcorn kettle rested like a crown. Alex lifted the tarp carefully with two fingers and then looked at the little scoop sitting on top the way a person puts a comb on a grave.

She breathed in and there it was, the ghost of butter or a thing trying to be butter. There was an imprint on the concrete where a jar had sat long enough to leave a ring. She touched it with her fingers and they came away darker, as if the glass had sweated. On a milk crate, papers sat in a stack, half-eaten menus from a place that served wings and a card with the name of the hospital and a sticker that said Visitor that someone had stuck and then peeled and stuck again so it had lint in its glue. There was no name on it. There was a stub of pencil. There was a napkin with a drawing of a bicycle on it that looked like a child had drawn and smooth adult hands had held onto too long.

“This is a church to him,” Parnell said quietly, a generosity Alex didn’t expect from him and loved him for, right there, hot and embarrassing as a teenager crush. “You can tell by the way he put the scoop.”

“He’s going to come back for this,” Alex said. “He’s going to come back even if he promised himself not to.” She put the tarp back like a lid and backed out of the little room, letting the door fall with a sound that made her teeth almost sing.

They went to the river anyway because that was where the hour would ring. The light at the bridge blinked as if it had a conscience and it was late to its own appointment. It wasn’t quite dark; the street had come to that two-minded moment where the blue is too thin and the yellow is too harsh. Alex locked the bike even though she knew she would unlock it in a hurry and hoped she would have the calm to get the key in the tiny hole. Her chest had that hum in it that comes before a climb. She let it be there. She didn’t push it down. She let her body know the danger in a way that would help and not send it running.

Barbara called once and let it ring into empty and then called again and said, into it, “She’s here.” Alex could hear how she held herself like a plate not to be dropped. Then there was the wind and the river’s particular syllable and the sound of a person too large to be quiet pretending to be quiet. He came around the buttress like someone making an entrance with the humility of a kid who knows he takes up too much stage. The jar was not in his hands. That change, small as it was in the world of changes, broke something in her tension and let another thing rise in its place.

“You didn’t bring it,” she said. She didn’t mean the property. She meant the shrine.

“I left it to sleep,” Jakob said. His face in this light looked like a cliff face in winter. It had new angles carved into it since the morning. “The boy with the yellow wristband,” he said. “He touched the glass with his lips like you touch a microphone when you don’t know how to talk into it. The nurse said no, no, no, and I put the lid tight and I brought it to the ladies with badges and their little scientist tongues. I thought if they ate it with their eyes they could tell me a better prayer. They looked at me like I was the bad smell in a room where someone had died. I want you to tell me what to do with my hands.”

Alex moved her hand a fraction and let it make the shape of putting a thing down. “You make a promise and then you keep it,” she said. “You stop touching boys and girls. You return the things that belong to Gale. You let me take you to a place where talking and harm aren’t friends. You tell Barbara that you can’t be the river. You be a man.”

He opened his mouth to argue and then closed it because he heard that his words would be something he’d already said to himself in a different tone and didn’t want to hear. “They don’t laugh,” he said, more plaintive than before, blinking like someone with grit in his eye. “They forget. If we don’t remind them they will survive by a method that does not include the sound that makes the chest let go.”

“They get to forget,” Alex said. “They get to not have you in their story. Sometimes not having a thing is how you get to live. Ask a person who put a bottle down and chose to look at her own face at four in the morning instead.”

He looked at her coin the way animals look straight at what other people pretend not to see. “You stopped,” he said. “Does it feel like the way a hill feels when you stop too soon and your legs itch and you hate everything.”

“It feels like the way a person’s hands look after they come in from a field,” she said. “It feels like being useful. It feels like a day you don’t have to apologize for yet.”

He took a step toward her without meaning harm, but the harm was in his size and the way he cast shadow like a sail that could pull a little boat sideways. Parnell shifted without making the big motion that would make this a fight. Barbara’s name thrummed in the air like a word you aren’t supposed to say in church. Alex kept her hands down and open and ordinary.

“Jakob Kral,” she said, putting all the syllables together like a path. “The city knows your name. You gave it to a wall. We will say it right, and then we will say the other names, the ones that belonged to the hands. We’ll put them with the bodies. We will do the ordinary holy things. Come with me.”

He looked at the water. He looked at her bike with the light on like a low star. He looked at his own hands and, not seeing this all at once, he laughed unexpectedly, a single burst that sounded surprised at itself. It wasn’t the laughter that hurt people. It was the beginning of the sound that happens when you see something you weren’t expecting to see and your body tells on you. He put his hands together like a book closing. He nodded once and then the air changed because footsteps came from the other side of the bridge, quick, angry, the kind of footsteps that belong to men who think about maintaining order and imagine it looks like fixing a fence you never built.

Two security guards from the storage units had followed them because the manager had decided bravery looked like that when the police left him alone with his conscience. They carried flashlights as if they were truncheons, and one of them was talking already, his voice big in the place where voices echo. He said, “You can’t be here,” like he owned the river, and he said, “You can’t—” and then the rest of the sentence was to be decided.

Jakob flinched in the way very large men flinch when they remember being little and startled in class and everyone laughed. He turned slightly in that way animals turn their bodies before they turn their minds. Alex brought her voice up and out and made it a wall.

“Stop,” she said to the guards without looking away from him. “Go back the way you came. This is police business.” She put all the rank she had in her tone and the bit that didn’t live on paper but in the hours she’d paid for it with. The guard with the flashlight faltered the way people do when they remember they’re not the star after all. He looked at Parnell, who had his hand on his holster and the kind of face that says both please and don’t you dare simultaneously. They backed off, muttering into their chest radios as if they could call in a god who liked storage units.

The moment had torn and been patched. You could see the seam. Jakob looked at it the way a person looks at a mended shirt, grateful and resentful in one breath. He said, “If I go with you will you let me stand in a doorway sometimes and put my hands where they can’t do anything.”

“I will let you stand in a doorway,” Alex said. “I will bring you chairs that don’t break.”

He nodded and then, without warning, without drama, he bolted. He moved all in one piece, as if all his choices had lined up and pointed the same direction for once and wanted to try that, like geese. The rain had slicked the stones and he still ran the way a man runs who has always wanted to be fast enough that nobody can take anything from him. Alex went after because of course she did. Parnell swore and ran too, the sound of his shoes the most honest thing in the night for a second.

They didn’t catch him. They caught the sound of him and the smell of wet wool and the impression of a shoulder brushing brick. They caught the way the light moved and then settled. They chased him until they were chasing the idea of him and then they stopped because you don’t make your body write checks it can’t cash without paying for it later. Alex bent over the handlebars and let her lungs make their argument with the air. She wasn’t angry at him for running. She was angry at the part of the world that had made him certain that stillness is a trap.

When she got home the fern had uncurling to do that it was doing whether or not she was there. She sat with her back to the sink again because the floor was the only honest chair. She called Barbara and said, “He didn’t go far. He won’t run forever. He left the jar.” There was a small silence like a bird landing. Then Barbara said, “He’s tired,” in a tone of voice that made tired sound like an empire.

“You okay,” her father texted a minute later because he had a way of wanting to walk on the left side of the street and see if it felt different, and it usually did. She texted back, Fine, because that word can hold anything you put into it. She considered the number on the little square of paper the woman had slipped her and then called it because she was tired of arranging the pieces by herself and because the rain had stopped and she could hear the city wringing itself out and thought, I am allowed to be held up by something I didn’t build.

In the morning, lab called to say that the hands were the hands of two boys lost within the last year, one from a flood three counties over and one from a hit-and-run out on River Road seven months back. They had belonged to bodies that were buried without them and families who had been told that not everything could be put back. The news landed with both feet on the day. Alex felt the way her mouth wanted to say something ugly and she didn’t let it. She let the fact be heavy and then put it on the shelf where she kept heavy things.

Patterson stood looking out at the gray world as they went through it and said, “Today you take warrants,” and Alex said, “Today I take warrants,” and Parnell said, “Today I take a sandwich and wish it were a beer,” and then apologized to the room without meaning to. The day moved forward because days in places like this have inertia. You push them when you can. They push you when they have to.

At lunch, Gale came by with a paper bag that smelled like cinnamon and handed it to Alex and said, “Donuts,” only because she believed in naming things and not because she thought sugar could fix what only people could fix. “You look like a person who has been chased by a cow and pretends it was a wind,” she said, which was as close to I care as she would get in public. “Did he look at the jar like it was a friend,” she asked, and when Alex said yes, Gale nodded as if that was useful information, which in a way it was. “Good,” she said. “Then he will feel it gone. Then he will come home to it and be empty there and that will teach him something. That’s all I ever ask: that people learn the right things from the bad days.”

In the afternoon Alex took the road that ran along the rails and let the bike eat up distance while her thoughts fought less because the body was busy. She remembered the way Jakob had said Isaiah into his chest as if it could absorb it and how names sometimes feel like peanut butter on the roof of your mouth, comforting and sticky and impossible to get rid of. She thought of the girl at Webster Park with the bandage and the way she had known what was wrong and wanted to be told she was right. She thought about how to put handcuffs on a man whose wrists told the story of a different life, one with forests and axes and being invited to do hard things because you could.

That night, the call came in from a block party that wasn’t a party yet. Someone had propped a projector on a garbage can and was trying to make a movie on a sheet. Someone had set up a table for hot dogs and lemonade, and someone had dragged a bouncer from a club out to sit on a folding chair and glare at teenagers, and he glared like it was a gift he was giving them. In the midst of that chaos something happened that made the noise change pitch. A boy laughed until he couldn’t, and he kept laughing past that. The mother went to hit and then to stroke and then to shake. Someone yelled a name with the three syllables of fury mothers have in their pockets. When Alex and Parnell rolled up, the giant was already dissolving, his shoulders going slack into the dark between the houses like the space the city didn’t know what to do with.

“We almost had him,” Parnell said through his teeth. He hadn’t run yet and he was already out of breath. He was thinking of running. The boy’s laughter ebbed into hiccups and tears, and his mother held him against her ribs like a thing you put back where it belongs when you find it in the wrong room.

“We did have him,” Alex said in a way that would be a joke to someone else and wasn’t to her. “He’s starting to want to be caught.” She could feel that like the weather, like pressure in her bones. The city turned its face toward night. Somewhere a popcorn machine, unplugged, waited like an animal. Somewhere a jar sat under light that buzzed and pretended not to be a shrine. Somewhere Barbara washed a pot harder than she needed to and cried over the sink not because it helped but because you have to give salt back to the day sometimes or it will choke on it. And somewhere under the arch of the bridge, a very large man who had decided his body was a problem and a solution at once stood with his hands held out from his sides as if he’d been told to, and whispered someone’s name into a place where names go to turn into echoes and then into nothing and then, eventually, if you work at it, into another kind of sound entirely.5

By morning the rain had taken the sharp edges off everything, even the names on the whiteboard, even the glass in the front doors. The city wore damp like a sweater and went about its errands. Alex woke to a dull ache along the outer sides of her calves that promised a good day if she kept moving, and to the sound of someone in the alley diagnosing a carburetor like it was a sick friend. She made coffee badly and drank it because it was there. When she turned her radio on, dispatch was speaking in the patient singsong that says all the fires are contained in their appropriate boxes, at least for now.

At roll call, someone had written Tickle Man in purple marker and someone else had drawn a long arm with too many joints and a smiley face with Xs for eyes, and Patterson stood there, took it in, and uncapped a black marker and Xed it out. “We don’t brand people,” she said without turning around. “We don’t sell fear to each other.” Her hair frizzed a little in the damp, which made her more human and did not diminish her authority. She said words about warrants and press releases and community reassurance and then looked at Alex. “You’re the face. You found him; you keep finding him. You can look straight at a camera and not think you’re being eaten alive. Do what that requires.”

Doing what it required meant standing in a room with a ring light on a tripod borrowed from someone’s teenager and saying sentences about patience and process, about being aware of your surroundings, about making sure your children knew they could yell and be heard. It meant using Jakob’s name because pretending he was a nameless monster was its own kind of harm. It meant pretending to be perfectly calm when she wanted to claw at the table’s underside with her nails until she made a mark that would be there long after she retired.

After, she walked around the block and put the sponsor’s number, the one on the little square of brochure paper, into her phone. When she called, the woman said “This is June” and then “Oh, it’s you” like she’d been expecting Alex not because she was special but because the city turns people into repetitions of each other sooner or later. June’s voice had the creak of old floorboards and the clean smell of new fruit, and Alex told her the bare minimum, the name of the feeling in her throat, the way sleep arrived and left again like a dog between rooms.

“H.A.L.T.,” June said, like a teacher and a co-conspirator. “Hungry, angry, lonely, tired. You’re at least three of those right now. Go fix the ones you can fix. Also, you’re not the river. You can stand next to it as long as you want, but you don’t have to become it. Don’t go to people’s houses to be their courage. Give them your number and go home.”

Alex almost laughed, real, right there on the sidewalk where the rain had tucked itself under the awnings and was sitting sulking. “I already gave a kid my number,” she said. “He’s good. I think.”

“Then you’re already disobeying me,” June said, and the smile in her voice made the disobedience feel less like sin and more like weather. “Eat. Tell your legs you love them. Call me before you do the next stupid noble thing and I’ll tell you whether I approve.”

Eddie answered on the second ring when she called, which felt like a small victory for both of them. His aunt’s voice came in first in the background, asking who it was and whether he’d done his schoolwork, and then his breath came like he’d put the phone under a blanket.

“I wasn’t going to call you,” he said. “But you said you would come if I did and I want you to know something before it’s on the news and it looks like I kept it to make myself bigger.” He worked his jaw as if words gummed up and needed help to come. “He came to the skate park,” he said. “He didn’t tickle anybody. He sat on the low wall and watched and when little kids fell he said, ‘Your knees can take it,’ and one of the moms told him to go away and he did. He had that red thing like at the movies? He had it in his car. He asked me how to fix a chain on my board even though boards don’t have chains. I think he’s dumb and also he’s not. I laughed when I went down the ramp and then I felt bad because what if my laugh gets stolen, and then I felt dumb because I know that’s not how it works. My aunt says don’t carry men’s ideas for them. That’s their job.”

“That’s good advice,” Alex said. “What color was the car.”

“I don’t know cars,” Eddie said, offended on behalf of himself. “It looked like a car. No hubcaps on one side. Sounded like it had a cold. He had a sticker on the back that was a tree, but not like a Christmas tree, like a real tree that someone badly drew.”

“You did good,” she said. “You just did the most grown thing, which is not keep a secret that would hurt other people if you kept it.”

He was quiet a beat. “Did you ever laugh when you weren’t supposed to,” he asked, like an attack and a confession both.

“Every funeral,” she said. “Every wedding. Every time the city does a parade with bagpipes. The body is not polite. It’s your friend. Let it be dumb sometimes.” She heard his thanks in the way his breath changed and he didn’t hang up right away. She hung up first because sometimes that’s mercy.

Lab called midmorning with language that tried to dress facts in charts and failed because some facts take their clothes off and run wild. The fluid in the jar was glycerin and saline, the kind of homebrew that preserves without preserving, an Instagram recipe for macabre that meant he hadn’t taken them from any official place. The hands had been in water long enough to learn the water’s language and only afterward been put in the bellies of glass. Prints on the lid were smeared with ridges like country roads; Jakob’s, they thought, and a couple smaller ones from Gale and from a nurse who had reflexively touched the lid in the family room and then recoiled. The nails had bits of soil and something like nail polish, chipped, a pale blue the lab tech labeled “aqua” with unconscious sweetness. There was a call from a detective three counties over with the flood who wanted to bring a mother in to see what she didn’t want to see and was going to anyway, because love is an idiot and we all let it drive.

Patterson’s eyebrows made a tent over her eyes as she read. “We can get a warrant for the unit,” she said. “We can get a warrant for his car if we find it. We can get an arrest warrant that won’t make me ashamed to show it to a judge I respect. We will not make a circus.”

At Irving, the manager made a face like he’d done a very hard thing by pointing to a line on a sheet with a stale pen and wanted a medal. CSU did their brisk ballet in the rain smell, bagging the popcorn scoop, dusting the handle on a bucket, photographing the ring-shaped print on the floor where the jar had sat. There was a cot with a concave pillow that said a head had tried to learn to rest there and hadn’t quite. Under the cot, carefully stacked, were flyers for community events— pancake breakfast, 5K for kids’ cancer, a vigil for a girl lost two winters ago whose face had been printed too light so her eyes faded out into the paper. On the wall, thumbtacked, a newspaper article about a boy on a bicycle who had finished a race after falling and bleeding and laughing all the way up the last hill. The name at the bottom was the kind you make a scrapbook out of if you love somebody.

There was a receipt crumpled in the bottom of a plastic bin for glycerin, bought at a craft store where everything smelled like glue and hope. There was a calendar with Xs on the days the hospital had rung its bell for somebody; some Xs were too dark, as if the pencil had pressed hard enough to dent the paper. Parnell held up a wrinkled tourist map with circles around the parks and marks that looked like a child had tried to draw constellations on a life. “It’s not a plan,” he said. “It’s a heart.”

Barbara called while they were bagging the scoop. Her voice was low, like she’d gone into the bathroom to get away from the house and its effortful living. “He came by and said he was going to make a sound,” she said. “He said he was going to make a sound and then be quiet for a long time. He carried that red machine like it was a drum. He asked me if I had ice. I said no and he said good, because he didn’t either and that meant we were family.”

“Where,” Alex asked, and Barbara said, “Bandstand by the old fountain where nobody goes because pigeons think it’s theirs,” and Alex said, “We’ll meet him there,” and Barbara said, “Be kind to him until you can’t. Then be a hammer,” and hung up before she could take it back.

They did not roll up with sirens. They parked two blocks away and walked, and the rain had gone from sheets to thin string, sewing new lines into the afternoon. The bandstand had the kind of roof you see on postcards of towns that believe in themselves and continue to even when there are fewer shops open every season. There were three teenagers with their hoods up sitting on the steps, and a woman pushing a stroller who watched everything the way women with strollers have taught themselves to watch, shoulder-tilt, wheel swivel, ready to go where the other bodies aren’t. Jakob had set the popcorn machine on the boards and was turning the little crank by hand, which did nothing, a gesture in search of magic. He had found a generator somewhere and it coughed like a sick dog. He had a bag from the discount grocer stapled shut at the top and he kept flipping it like it was heavy. His face when he saw Alex went a little slack with relief and then gathered itself into the thing it had been trying to be in the mirror.

“I figured you were coming,” he said. “The way my sister says things, it puts paths down.”

“You can’t set up a show,” Alex said, and her voice tried to choose between gentle and cop and landed on something that was both and neither. “You can talk. You can make people look. You put the machine away and you come with me and we will open a door to a room where people who know how to put big people into chairs are waiting.”

He shook his head once, not to say no, but to clear it. “I won’t touch them,” he said. “I promised. Look— my hands,” and he lifted them like the police tell you to on television, palms out, fingers spread, a funny supplication in a man that size. He had written something on his left palm in ink that bled a little. From where she stood, Alex couldn’t read it and didn’t try to step closer.

People came as people will, drawn by the hum of the generator, the smell of motion, the sense that something might be given away. A man in a T-shirt with a hardware store logo on it stepped in close and then thought better of it and stepped back. A woman with a dog the size of a loaf of bread stopped and let the dog sniff which told the crowd that this was, for now, not danger. One of the teenagers on the steps flipped his hood back and revealed a haircut that had likely cost more than Alex’s bicycle chain. A little kid, maybe three, with a nose glossy with whatever colds do, stopped dead and stared with the absolute insolence of childhood.

Jakob spoke the way men talk when they’ve been living under bridges and on porches and in rooms with locks, quieter than his body would suggest, careful not to take up sound. He talked about a red bike with a bell that didn’t ring until he fixed it with a rubber band. He talked about Isaiah, not in the tragic way but about something ordinary, how he’d say “later” like it was a place you could go, and about how one time he had thrown popcorn in the air and caught it in his mouth and nearly choked and made everyone laugh, even the nurse with the straightest mouth in the building. He did not say anyone’s names who had not given him permission by dying. He laughed once at his own stupidity and it was not the laughter that sank teeth into ribs; it was a man’s laugh at his own large smallness.

“You can’t do this,” Alex said again, softer. “You can’t make your show on other people’s nervous systems. Your grief is loud. Go put it in the place where grief belongs and let other people breathe their own air.”

“I’m not touching,” he said, almost petulant. The generator finally caught and the light inside the kettle glowed, making everything golden and cheap at once. He poured kernels into the metal belly with a carefulness that broke something in Alex and made her want to take him by the sleeve and sit him down and rest her hand on his shoulder like a priest in a quieter religion. The first pop was a silly miracle, a small explosion that made the three-year-old clap and the teenagers try not to smile. Popcorn is not a holy thing; it pretends to be holy for four minutes and then becomes cold and aspectless and still makes you happy if you let it. He scooped and shook, the motion as old as the concession stand on any little league field.

“Do you want to go to jail the way people make movies out of,” a man at the back of the small crowd called, not mean yet, curious in that unsafe way a certain kind of man is when he senses a play. “You’re famous. You’re going to be on TV with your arms tied behind your back. You going to laugh then.”

“Don’t,” Alex said without turning her head, to that scattered talk, to the world. “Not today.”

A bottle arced in from the side, not at anyone, because aim is not a trait everyone is given; it struck the railing and exploded into brown glass tears. Two pigeons shot up from under the roof like an extra cheer. The kid with the glossy hair yelped and then laughed reflexively because the body is dumb, like she’d told Eddie, and the sound went through the gathered people and came back wrong. Jakob moved in that way he had, precise, and got between the shatter and the stroller in one step. He was good at getting between. He held out his hand like he could catch all the next things.

“Enough,” Alex said, and stepped onto the boards. Parnell shifted, not drawing, not not-drawing. The generator hiccuped and threatened to die, lighting the kettle from beneath in a flicker that made it look like a church for a dumb god, and the rain thinned to nothing, and for a second it looked like every labor day she’d ever been to in Fulton, small and earnest and wearing its own heart on the outside.

“Come with me,” she said to Jakob. “Come with me and you can stand in a doorway and put your hands where they can’t do anything. Come with me and we’ll take the names out of the jar and put them where they go, with loud prayers and brass and dirt. You can work where your size is useful and your grief is a thing that doesn’t walk around touching strangers.”

He seemed to tilt toward her, like a sunflower toward a decent light. He seemed to stop holding his own neck up with intention and let it rest on the stem of him. “I don’t want to make it worse,” he said to her and to himself and to Isaiah. “I hate that I’m the one telling the story out loud, like that means it’s mine. It’s not mine. I’m just loud.”

He took one step. Then the county cruiser came softyloud around the corner with its lights making the day dumb and its sound turned down to the pitch that says we don’t want you to run, and a deputy Alex didn’t know well enough to like yet stepped out with a taser and a voice that had practice saying no one ever got mad at me for going too far. “Hands,” he said, and he meant Jake’s hands and Alex’s hands and every hand that had ever been anywhere.

“Relax,” Parnell said to the deputy, and raised one palm his direction. “We’re almost—”

“We are not almost anything,” the deputy said, not aloud to them but to the future version of himself who would tell this story at a bar and, he hoped, receive nods. He raised the taser two inches, not nothing, and somebody in the little knot of people made the sound of a mother being moved without her consent.

Jakob looked at the long yellow thing with a useless kind of amazement, like a big horse looking at the hinge on a stall door. He took a step back, not big, but enough for the boards to creak and for the generator to cough as if the vibration offended it. Alex lifted both hands and spread them and spoke as if she was teaching a class of small children not to run in a hallway, because that is as wise as you ever get in moments like these.

“No,” she said. “No more yelling. No more anything with batteries. We are done with that. You—” to the deputy “—put that down. Parnell, if he shoots I want you to arrest him and then explain it to Chief in front of a camera.”

The deputy made the face men make when told to do a thing by a woman they don’t report to. Jakob swallowed and took another slow step, like a person on a ferry that has started to pull away while they’re still deciding whether they’re on it. “I brought the scoop,” he said, in that bright sudden way that children get when they remember the one piece of good news they can carry, and he reached for the metal thing with his fingertips like a pianist and placed it on the edge of the bandstand nearest Alex. It was stupid and perfect, a gesture toward being part of the human race again, toward handing things to other people instead of taking.

A siren a few blocks over did the two-note thing that in Fulton always sounded like a question. Somewhere, a dog barked exactly the number of times a dog barks when the day is settling. The small crowd had doubled without anyone meaning it to; that is how towns breathe. It was too crowded for a taser to be wise and Alex put her body in the way because that’s what she had promised June she wouldn’t do and what she knew how to do before she knew her own name. Parnell moved to back her, a second body making a bench.

Jakob turned his head like a sunflower again, one way, the other, trying to find the light that made sense. He had written ISAIAH on his left palm in block letters, so when he put his hands up the name lifted, a white-worded protest sign against his own skin. He looked at the name and then at Alex, and she felt more than saw the exact moment he gave himself to the next thing, whatever next thing there was, the shape of someone who has finally found a thing heavier than he is and decided to set his own weight down.

“Okay,” he said, nearly a whisper, and the crowd didn’t hear him because the crowd never hears the first part of any change. “Okay,” he said, a little louder, and then the generator died.

Silence doesn’t fall. It lifts. It left them there in the underneath of sound where the little noises show themselves, clothes touching, pigeons, somebody slurping lemonade. In that lift, the deputy thought he heard the thing he was scared of, the sound of a big man moving, and he panned the taser, and it was enough like gunfire to make a girl scream and enough unlike that it made a man laugh nervously and enough exactly itself to make Jakob flinch and move to protect the stroller again.

Alex moved with him and put a hand out without touching, and her body made a wall of no that he understood, because some animals recognize fences. “With me,” she said, and he said “With you,” and then the teenager with the expensive haircut yelled, “You’re not even doing anything!” at the deputy, like this was a football game and he wanted everyone to be better at their positions, and something in the knot of them broke open and let the street in, and a girl darted forward to grab a piece of popcorn from the scoop as if it meant she had stolen something valuable from the mouth of a story.

They did not arrest him there because the moment didn’t permit it. The deputy was sent to the far end of the block by Parnell with words that would get codified as policy later. The small crowd melted into neighbors again as soon as the drama turned into logistics. Barbara arrived panting, her towel back over her shoulder, and looked at the scoop and at Alex and at her brother and shook her head with a severity that was sister, not mother, not judge. “Don’t make me dress you down in public,” she said to him. “I swear to God I will.”

“I know,” he said, with such gratitude that it made three mothers in the crowd look at each other and decide to forgive their own brothers for what they had done at a wedding ten years ago. He turned to Alex like a dog that has finally decided to let a hand be a hand instead of a threat. “I will go,” he said. “Not with the man with the yellow gun. With you. To the room with chairs. But I need to do a thing, quick. A thing with locks.”

“We’re going to Irving,” Alex said. “You’re going to give me a key instead of asking me to pick one. And then you’re going to show me where the other jars are not.”

He nodded like a person who has been allowed to keep a tiny dignity in a ledger that owes them nothing. He looked heavy and light at once, the way a field looks just before a storm when every stalk is trying to stand up straight to prove it can.

They didn’t put cuffs on him on the walk to the cars. She asked him, and he said, “Not yet,” and she made the calculation in the place behind her ribs where she had built a little office for decisions that had no precedent. He cradled the popcorn scoop like a relic all the way down the block and handed it to her only when asked, and even then his fingers lingered on the metal as if it might tell his hands what to do next.

Irving’s manager stood up when he saw them and then sat down again because it is hard to decide where your body belongs when two stories are getting told in your lobby at once and you run the register in only one of them. He slid the ledger toward Alex like a shield. Jakob pulled a key from his pocket and set it on the counter with the care of a person who has learned the meanings of small objects late and fiercely. The hallway buzzed to life in segments as they walked, fluorescent gratitude and complaint, and their shadows ran ahead of them and then waited at the turns like children.

The door rattled up and the same smell breathed out— sugar that wasn’t sugar, old oil, the metallic tang that never leaves machines. He went to the tarp that covered the red enamel and lifted it with reverence and then placed his big hand on the belly of the machine and left it there, his head bent as if he could hear it thinking. “No more jars,” he said. “No more jars,” again because he liked the feel of the words like a lid that fit. He looked up at Alex and there was a new angle in his mouth, a line that might become steadiness if not often interrupted.

She stood in the doorway because she wanted him to have the room, wanted to see if he could be big in it without touching anything. Parnell stood to her left with his weight on his heels, a man who had learned to wait for good things and bad ones with equal posture. Jakob took a step toward the milk crate and lifted a notebook from underneath a magazine about lawn equipment, the disguise of choice in rooms like this. He flipped it open and showed her lines of names written not in any order she could see, boys’ names, not all of them Isaiahs. Some were crossed out in a way that said the person had not gone, but some other choice had been made. Some had stars. Some had an arrow pointing to an address or the word “tree.” At the very bottom, in a different hand— a kid’s, maybe Isaiah’s, maybe some other kid’s whose hands hadn’t been asked for— the words When we are lions.

“That’s not yours,” she said gently, because she knew that sometimes the saying of a thing made it less open to theft. “That belongs to someone who trusted you with their marker.”

He nodded, chastened by the way the room had feelings. He pulled from the back of the unit a plastic tote with a lid that snapped and handed it to her without opening it. “That’s nothing bad,” he said. “It’s paper. It’s— you’ll see. You can decide. I don’t want to keep decisions. I’m no good at them.”

She snapped it open and found drawings, all bicycles, all slightly wrong and exactly right— spokes for sun rays, handlebars as smiles. Tucked in with the drawings, a hospital bracelet with a tiny skinny barcode. She swallowed around the thing in her throat that wasn’t coffee. “We’re going now,” she said. “We’re going to a chair.”

He stepped out of the unit and into the narrow light and held his wrists out in front of him. He looked at his hands like a man looking at a horse who has decided to trust him, amazed and frightened of ruining it. “Okay,” he said, voice knotted. “Now,” he added, and it wasn’t a challenge; it was a consolation to himself. She put the cuffs on him because it was time, because there is mercy in procedure also, in knowing the next move even if you hate it. He flinched when the metal closed, not in pain, but in embarrassment, and she wanted to say, We’ve all worn worse, but she didn’t.

From outside came the sound of someone shouting into a phone how the police were here and they had the guy and also the red thing from the movies, and the manager saying “Don’t say my name,” and Barbara’s voice on Alex’s phone when it buzzed in her pocket saying “Is he with you,” and Alex not answering until the cuffs were settled and the door rolled down and the key turned and the rain began again in earnest, as if the weather had been waiting for its cue.

In the cruiser, he sat sideways because there is no seat made for men like him, not in cars built for budget. He looked out the window at the strip of sky and said, “When I was little I thought the police took you somewhere deep underground and gave you a different air to breathe,” and Alex said, “Sometimes it feels like that,” and he nodded as if he was being agreed with about something he hadn’t meant to share.

The station did what stations do when something from television comes in in real texture and smell. It tried to pretend nothing was happening and failed. Patterson stood in the doorway of booking with her hands in her pockets like she didn’t trust her hands right now. The first thing Jakob asked was for a chair that wouldn’t break, and someone found him the one from the community room with the reinforced legs that they used for the old guys when they came to talk about scams. He sat carefully, like a gift for the furniture, and let the cuffs be because the cuffs belonged for this part. He looked smaller and much larger at the same time.

“No more jars,” he said again, without prompting, as if reminding the room of the new rules. “No more touching. Popcorn only.” He looked up at Alex and then away and then up again. “If I say the names you’ll think I’m stealing them. If I don’t say them, I think I am leaving them in the jar. How do you hold on and not keep.”

“That’s the only question,” June would say if she were here, and Alex said it now, borrowing shamelessly. “That’s it. You say them in the places where saying them helps, and you don’t say them in the places where it turns into theater. And you don’t get to decide alone. That’s what community is for. You take your good will and you make it humble.”

He breathed like he had lifted something heavy and wanted to drop it and was not going to. Parnell did the paperwork with his mouth a line that pretended to be simple. Someone in the bullpen sighed, one long exhale that might have been relief or disappointment at the lack of a foot chase. The lab called to say the second mother was on her way with a sweater in her arms that might have been for the boy who wasn’t going to need it.

They put Jakob in a holding cell that smelled faintly of the ghost of a thousand bad choices and one or two good ones and shut the door and the sound it made was still the sound that doors make when they change the shape of a day. He sat, and the bench did not complain even though it could have. He looked at the steel like it was the back of a stage and he was checking sight lines. He rested his forehead on his hands and the ink of ISAIAH left a ghost on his skin in reverse, Siamese to the letters that faced the world.

“You’ll get arraigned,” Alex said, and when he looked up he had the look of a boy in a hall outside a principal’s office, brave and caught. “The hospital will get a hold put on you. There will be an evaluation. We will write reports that make you sound like a list. You will not be a list. We will bring Barbara. We will bring a lawyer. You will say what you mean to say, not what your mouth thinks would make it shorter. You will breathe. You will get your own air.”

“Can I laugh,” he asked, with a straight face that made Parnell cough to cover his own soundlessness.

“Not yet,” Alex said. “Soon. When it doesn’t hurt anybody. When it doesn’t bend any ribs.” She looked at his big hands and thought of the stupid scoop and the way he’d placed it like it was a peace offering. He looked at her legs and thought, she could tell, about hills.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Gale that said simply Did you, and she wrote back We did, and Gale wrote back Bring me my machine, and added a little lightning bolt, as if to bless it with weather. Then there was a text from Eddie that said Did he hurt anybody and she wrote back No, and he wrote K, and then after a minute wrote Thank you in full, which was another kind of courage.

Patterson put a hand on Alex’s shoulder and left it there long enough to count to three. “You did it without making a mess,” she said. “You did it with a show in the middle and still no mess. I’m going to keep you,” she added with dry affection that felt like a new stripe on a sleeve. “Now call the families. Let them hate us in the ways they need to. Let them teach us how to be better at graves.”

That night, the city exhaled in the particular way Fulton did when rain had washed all day and then stopped at dusk, clean without boasting. Alex went home and the fern had uncurled halfway to the shape it had intended all along. She set the popcorn scoop on her kitchen table because she was an idiot and because sometimes you let talismans into your house on purpose. It made the table look like a carnival had been here and left behind a promise to come back. She called June and said, “I stood in the way and didn’t die,” and June said, “Sometimes you get to keep two rules at once,” and then they didn’t talk because it was enough to hear each other breathe.

She slept with the radio on because part of her didn’t trust the world to keep itself while she was gone. She dreamt not of jars but of fields and wheels and chalk hands, and in the middle of the night she woke to a thin sound that might have been laughter or might have been the pipes, and she didn’t get up. The other Alex in the window was still there, but her eyebrow was down; she looked tired like a person who has worked a good day.

At dawn, the phone rang before the sun showed itself properly and she knew in that way we know that there will be no peaceful coffee. Barbara’s voice came on careful, trying to balance four things on one plate. “They took him,” she said. “They said it’s better if he goes now. He asked if you would tell him a joke. He said you had jokes you haven’t used up yet. He said to tell you that the river can be quiet and it still moves.”

“I’ll go,” Alex said, and realized she would, to the room with chairs and the stranger professionals and the whiteboard with the words that try to make oceans drinkable. She stood and her legs argued and then agreed. The rain had left the streets drawn sharp. Somewhere a bakery was already making the bread that would make the town think it was okay for a few hours. She touched the coin and put it back. The scoop sat on the table dumb and sure, a ridiculous relic, and she smiled at it because sometimes you have to let the small stupid objects do part of the holding for you so you can have your hands free for other work.8

The forensic unit looked like a school that had been told to behave. The colors were soft on purpose, the furniture had the rounded edges you give only to places where you expect people to collide with them, and the air had a smell that aimed for lemon and overshot into a note you only get when plastic gets wiped again and again. Alex signed her name in the box on the clipboard and watched the pen hesitate as if it wanted to go back to someone younger who hadn’t yet learned to write her name down next to words like hold and evaluation and visitor. June had said on the phone, before Alex left the apartment, that there were days when all you could do was be the pair of shoes you wore and walk them somewhere decent, and Alex liked that because it gave the work a shape she could step into without trying to be clever.

A woman with a lanyard full of cards that declared she was a licensed this and a certified that came to the door and looked at Alex like she might be one of the hard ones, and then something in Alex’s face convinced her otherwise. “Fifteen minutes,” the woman said, but she said it as if they both knew that clocks in rooms like this had elastic. “No touching. He’s calm. He asked for you like you were a song he remembered the name of. If he gets bigger than you like, you stand and you let me do my job. I love him already for being himself, and I won’t let him break my furniture.”

“I brought a joke,” Alex said, because it was the only way to admit to herself that she had come to stand in front of a man who had asked her to do something small and tender in a place made for containment. The woman’s mouth softened and then tightened as if she had opened her hand over a bird and then remembered the cat.

“He’s in two,” she said. “He cried twice, and both times he apologized to the air. He has the quality of a person you find on your porch in the morning and you don’t know if you should feed them or call someone and then you do both. Don’t tell me what you do with him legally. I don’t need it in my head while I’m loving him.”

Room two had a window you couldn’t open and chairs heavy enough that you would need a second person to help if you wanted to throw one, which Alex appreciated because it made the room confess what it was engineered for. Jakob sat on a chair that had been made for a big man to look less big on it, and it almost worked. His wrists were cuffed in front because someone had decided not to humiliate him for no reason, and he had the look in his eyes that people get in hospitals when they’ve had to adjust the size of their hope to fit the equipment. His hair looked the same as before, that half-grown defeat, but his mouth had more human in it and less myth.

“You came,” he said, and the words were simple and good and without the decoration some men put on gratitude to keep from having to feel it.

“I came,” she said. “You said tell a joke or you’ll forget how to be a person.”

He nodded, solemn, like this was surgery. “Say it slow,” he said. “Say it like bread.”

“Why did the popcorn machine refuse to testify,” she said, and she didn’t even feel stupid until the second half of the sentence because his face did a little hopeful lift.

“I don’t know,” he said, and that was a good answer for once.

“It didn’t want to be a snitch,” she said, and then she heard how bad it was, truly, and put her hands over her face and made a sound that belonged to someone who had been brave too long and had to let herself be foolish. He stared at her, horrified, and then his mouth did a thing, and then it did it again, and then laughter came out of him like a piece of machinery that had been stuck and you finally hit it with a hammer and it knocked loose.

“It’s terrible,” he said, and he was delighted by how much he meant that. “It’s the worst— do another,” he said, greedy the way kids get when you give them a piece of candy you bought with your own money and tell them, this is for you, and they know your money had other places to go.

“Why don’t bicycles ever get lost,” she said with her hands still on her face because if she showed him her grin she might start crying and she wanted to save that for the parking lot.

“They have— because—” he struggled with it, wanting to get to the part where the words slot into the thing they’re building together.

“They follow their cycles,” she said, and groaned and heard herself and couldn’t stop, and he slapped his big thigh with his cuffed hands and made a noise that contained two things, the joke and the other thing behind it, which was being allowed to be a person right now, in this room, with all this plastic very carefully not breaking.

“That’s not even—” he said, and shook his head and then said softly, “Thank you,” as if she had brought him a glass of water in the middle of moving furniture on a hot day. He took a breath and let it out the way boys do when they are trying to be brave and only remember for a second that they don’t have to. “They put my name on a chart,” he said. “They wrote it where you can see it when you walk by, and I wanted to go take the marker and add the K to everybody’s name, make them fancy. I told the lady in the sweater that Isaiah would have liked the way the nurses talk to each other. She said, don’t use people’s grief for decoration, and I said, I don’t know the difference between decoration and life right now. She told me that’s what this room is for.”

“It is,” Alex said. “And it’s also for keeping you off the bridge, and out of rooms where you take things apart that need to be left whole.”

He nodded to the word whole like it was a gospel he’d heard people sing and was deciding whether it could be his. “The mothers,” he said, and for the first time since he’d asked for her he looked ashamed in a way not related to humiliation, but to actual remorse. “I did not think that they would have to see the part and the whole separately. I thought I was rescuing names.”

“You were stealing from bodies,” she said, and when he winced she let him, because he needed to wince here and not later when someone with less patience would make him do it harder. “We’re going to make it right. The lab is going to send them home. There will be words in a place with chairs and maybe a bell. We’ll not put it on a wall for donors unless somebody asks us to. We’ll do what the mothers say and not what makes the newspapers feel like they closed a circle.”

His cuffs clinked softly as he rubbed his thumb across his palm where the ink ghost of ISAIAH still showed in reverse. “Can I write again,” he asked. “Not names. A shape. A tree,” he said, and the word came out with the ache of someone who has made a life out of lifting machines and still wants leaves.

“You can write after,” she said. “You can write with a pencil in a room that looks out on a rectangle of grass with a fence. There are rules. We’ll do them. You will get a lawyer with eyes that know how to look at a person and not their charge. You will be given paper, but not the kind you can fold into things that hurt you.”

He stared at the table for a second as if it might reveal a magic path. “I like your legs,” he said, and then shook his head hard because he heard it how it sounded and his face clicked into mortified. “No— I mean— I like that you use them. I like that they are what you put between you and the world on purpose. Isaiah—” he stopped and then decided to go into that room after all because they were always going into rooms together, all of them, whether or not they wanted to “—Isaiah said the best part of a hill is when you have to decide if you’re going to stand on the pedals or sit. He said sitting is for people who think the world should change for them. Standing is for when you change yourself.”

“Your nephew had a philosophy minor,” Alex said, and saw his whole face change to something lighter because it was something an aunt would say, and he chose to be a sister for a second and laughed again at the thought of a little boy giving commencement speeches to a family at a kitchen table that could barely hold the casserole and the arguments.

The social worker came to the door and did not come in, because she was good at the calibration of presence. “Time,” she said, and her face had the softness of a person who knows when a minute continues after you mark it over. “He needs to do the thing where he tells me his name and where he lives and what season it is, and then he gets pudding.”

“Do I,” he said, about the pudding, like a child, and Alex wanted to kiss his forehead the way you kiss a sleeping animal you have had to catch, and instead she pressed her palm flat on the table like a person stopping a glass from sliding.

“I’ll see you after arraignment,” she said. “And not a show this time. A room with chairs. Popcorn later, when it’s allowed. No jars, not ever.”

“No jars,” he said, and held her gaze as if he were making an oath that people will tell a story about later, and then looked down and whispered it again because sometimes the second time is when the body writes it on its own wall.

Outside, rain had turned into a mist that gathered under the trees like a committee. Parnell called her as she was unlocking the bike and said the judge had set an arraignment for the next morning if the hospital signed off on transport, which meant it would probably be later because hospitals keep their own clocks until the end of time. Lab had called with the names of the boys that matched the hands, and the detective from the flood county did the quiet thing where he didn’t insist on jurisdiction because certain human acts scrapped all maps. The families wanted to come. One mother had already decided that her boy would like the canal better than the highway, just for a few minutes before he went to earth, because he liked water even when it frightened him.

Alex called Chief Patterson and said she was going to be the person who made it so two women could stand at the edge of Fulton’s bad-breath river and light a candle without the city trying to take something else from them. Patterson swore in a way that showed love for the grammar and said she would accompany, not because chiefs always do, but because sometimes a boss knows when to put her body where her officer is so the weight of it spreads out. Alex called Gale because the popcorn machine had become a symbol whether any of them liked it or not, and Gale said, “It’s evidence,” and then, “Fine. It can show up. I’ll be there with a fuse and a scowl, which is my Sunday outfit anyway,” and Alex laughed and felt it wobble and accepted that this was what her mouth would do today.

The car from three counties over pulled into the civic center lot that afternoon with a woman inside who held a sweater with both hands like it had something delicate in it and, at the same time, was ready to swing it like a weapon if anybody tried to take the room away from her. Her name was Roxanne, and she wore her grief like a hard hat, forward, chin down, ready to bang it into a beam if she had to. The other mother, Lila from River Road, was thinner than grief wanted to let her be and had hands that made and unmade lists even when she wasn’t touching paper. They looked at each other like women who had stood on opposite sides of a long counter for years and only now realized the surface had always been a mirror.

“I’m not going to look in any jars,” Roxanne said, as if someone had already tried to make her. “I don’t want to see parts. I want to say the name and I want the river to act like it hears me. The detective with the handsome last name said you were a person who would understand that.”

“I do,” Alex said, and took them to the little room where families wait for bad news that comes with good, and made them tea they wouldn’t drink and took the sweaters and folded them and put them on the back of chairs that had held other sweaters, folded by other hands. The lab tech had done what lab techs do when they decide to trick your eyes into thinking something isn’t as bad as it is; she had put the small sealed containers into a white box with a clear lid, which made it both worse and better. Alex didn’t open it. She didn’t make the women touch it. She let it sit on the table like something you don’t look at directly when you name the dead in church.

They went to the canal when the light did the old trick where it pretends to be generous and barely is. Gale stood beside the bandstand in a jacket that looked like it belonged to a sport that happens in storms and had the machine on a dolly because she wasn’t going to break her back for a symbol and no one should ask her to. Eddie skated up and then skated back and then skated up again and held his board in his hands like he was trying to teach himself to sit still. Barbara came and stood on the second step of the bandstand and put her hand over her mouth the way people do when they know they’re going to say a thing and aren’t ready to hear it yet. Chief stood at the edge, that geometry teacher stance that made teenagers on bicycles try to do better algebra just by being near her.

They didn’t invite a priest or a pastor, not because they were against such people, but because Lila’s church had told her with softness that made her want to scream that God had plans, and Roxanne’s had told her with a firmness that made her want to run that everything happens for a reason, and both of them needed to be indoors with their fury for a few years before they went back to a building designed to be a throat. Alex looked at them and at the little box on the table that had been dragged out to be an altar and at the water, and felt the city lean in the way it does when it wants to see how you’re going to handle yourself.

“Say them,” Gale said, not unkindly, and then looked like she wanted to kick herself because she hated telling anyone what to do with their mouths unless they were haggling over a price.

Roxanne said the name of her boy, and it was one of those names that the town had said into microphones and onto yard signs last year when the flood came and made everyone neighbors for six days. She said it like a person saying a telephone number out loud so she won’t forget it, and then she said it again in the tone of a mother leaning out the door to call a child home from a field, not angry, just ready for dinner. Lila said the name of her boy like she had stored it in her top drawer under her socks and had taken it out just for today, and her mouth did that thing a mouth does when it wants to smile because the memory is sweet and wants to not smile because the world is not.

Alex opened the box because she had been the one to agree to this and there is a price for saying yes, and she had decided long ago she could pay with her own body sometimes and not make other people do it for her. She didn’t hold anything up. She didn’t make anyone coo or gasp or narrate. She put the whole thing into Gale’s grocery bag that had once held onions and flour and pretends for dinners and set it on the bandstand and nodded to the mothers and then to Chief, who nodded back because what else do you do in a town that keeps asking the river to be a better thing than it is.

They went the seven blocks to the edge of the cemetery because the funeral people had said they would not charge if the thing being buried fit into a small box that nobody should ever have had to buy. Kids on bikes went with them and then peeled off when they realized it wasn’t a parade, it was one of the other kinds of walking you do in a group. Eddie stayed on his board but kicked along slow, like a person who knows how to match pace and wants to. Barbara’s girls came with their hands in their pockets because pockets keep you from swinging your arms when you have too much to carry and none of it is visible.

At the place the groundskeeper had marked, in a corner where the grass tried hard, the mothers stood and Gale took off her hat and put it under her arm like a woman at a baseball game who knows the anthem but is not sure she can sing. The man who runs the cemetery has the voice of a person who rarely uses his voice, and that made the tiny thing he said beautiful; he said he was sorry, and he meant it, and he said it in the kind of tone that admits the words can’t do much and tries anyway.

They put the white boxes into the ground, and Lila dropped into the hole a little drawing of a bike with five spokes because to hell with math, and Roxanne put a quarter on top of the box like a toll for the part of the journey you shouldn’t have to pay for. Alex looked at the line of dirt that would go back on and thought about all the men she had booked who had asked whether someone would come to their funeral, and all the women she had watched put bills on their dead’s tongues because their grandmother had told them not to let kindness be underfunded. She thought about her own coin in her pocket and left it there because she wanted to spend it later in a lobby with a bad poster and a decent coffee.

Gale plugged the popcorn machine in at the bandstand after, because you need something for your hands at the end of any holy thing or you ruin your own day, and people ate the small hot food and burned their fingers a little without being angry and shook salt into their palms like a ritual they didn’t get taught and learned anyway. Chief held a paper cone and managed not to look silly, which made her seem softer, and Barbara stood with her towel like always and let people come and say their stupid good-intended things to her and didn’t engage unless the words hurt. Eddie took a handful and pressed it into his hoodie pocket because somebody had told him once that if you bring home something that smells like oil and salt your aunt will look at you like you had a life when she wasn’t watching.

When the crowd thinned down to neighbors again, Lila came over to Alex and said, “You didn’t make me look,” and Alex said, “It wasn’t mine to make,” and Roxanne said, “If I ever want to yell at the river again, can I call you,” and Alex said, “You can call me to tell me you yelled. I’ll say, good,” and they all three laughed in that busted way, and Gail looked at them and didn’t join in because some laughs are for the specific three people you see in the mirror at a certain angle and not for the town.

Patterson walked with Alex to Gale’s Salvage after, not because she had to, but because the rain had finally decided to go be someone else’s problem and the day had that rinsed feeling that makes you want to touch metal with your bare hands. The machine went back into its kingdom and Gale patted it like a large animal that had gone out and done something foolish and returned because you keep feeding it. There was official paper to sign that said that property had moved from evidence to owner because the charges that attached to it were not the kind of charges that require a person to be without their relic while the city thinks about itself.

“He asked for a chair that didn’t break,” Patterson said idly, as if she were telling Alex that she’d decided to plant tomatoes instead of beans, and Alex nodded like she hadn’t been there because there are times you let your boss have the words that don’t line up with the picture yet.

“You’re going to get called the woman who caught the Tickle Man,” Gale said, and Alex started to correct her and then let the air do it for her. “Don’t flinch,” Gale added. “Fulton will name its monsters with or without you. Better to put a real person’s name in the mix. Jakob Kral. Get the letters right. Tell people the K matters.”

“The K matters,” Alex repeated, thinking of the noticeboard in pediatrics and the way a smudge of scalp oil had gone onto a sign-in sheet and made a truth that no law understood. “He wanted to write it on other names,” she said, half to herself, and Gale made a sound that somewhere in it had the echo of the way women keep each other from trying to fix the wrong pieces.

On the way home, Alex rode the long way around the foundry because she liked the low roar of old machines doing exactly what they were asked to do in a world where very little behaved. Her legs felt like instruments that someone had finally tuned with care. Her phone buzzed and she nearly didn’t answer until she saw it was her father, who had the habit of calling at the exact second you were crossing a street, and if you let it go to voicemail, he would leave one more noise in a day that didn’t need it.

“You on that bike,” he said, as if he could smell the chain oil over the wire.

“I am,” she said, and had the sudden memory of being ten and him taking both training wheels off without asking and holding the back of the seat with one hand while she did a new thing with her body and thought she had invented flight.

“I saw the thing in the paper,” he said. “You did a good job not getting your hair cut off by the television. Your mother says your face looked tired, which, you know, means she thought you looked pretty. You coming over or are you busy stopping whoever’s eating hands now.”

“Please don’t say it like that,” she said, and then laughed because it was simpler than telling him what the day had been. “I’m coming Sunday, like I said. Tell Maddy to practice the recorder song that isn’t the lamb.”

“I won’t,” he said, and there was pride in his voice that made her legs feel hotter in a good way. “Hey,” he said, and his voice went cautious like he was putting a piece of glass down, “you’re doing the right thing, Al. That boy’s folks— I know that street. We worked on a porch over there back when the union asked us to put in sweat for something that wasn’t ours. Good people. You bring me any paperwork you can’t read and I’ll put on my glasses and pretend I can.”

She wanted to tell him about June and HALT and the feeling of having a hand on the middle of your back when you think you should fall, but what she did was say, “Bring the snowblower to my building. There’s a guy who thinks it’s a penguin and I want to show him it’s not,” and he laughed in a way that shook something open in her that she’d been holding fast, and then he said, “Be careful,” and it landed not like a command but like a blessing.

That night, the city did that trick where it made a small sound big enough to feel personal. Somewhere, a woman sang to a baby in a kitchen and the note traveled and turned into the sound of the radiator and the way a streetlight flickers before it decides to be steady. Alex put the scoop on the top of a cabinet because she didn’t want to keep it where it would be a joke when a day came that wasn’t one, and she called June and said, “I had to be a wall and a bridge today,” and June said, “Eat protein,” and then told her a story about dropping a meatloaf on the church steps in 1996 and the recovery that followed, and Alex kept the phone between her ear and her shoulder while she made eggs and felt the ordinary holiness of a pan that had no opinion about good and bad.

In the morning, arraignment happened in a room that always smells faintly of coffee and bad luck. The judge had a face that teenage Alex would have drawn if someone asked her to draw fairness. Jakob stood between a lawyer with hair that refused to obey gel and a bailiff who put her hand on the back of his arm in a way that said she understood nerves and also that he would not be permitted to use his size to change anyone’s plan. He listened, and his listening face was his best face; it made him look like a student in a class he’d once dropped and come back to because the world asked him to be better than he had been.

The prosecutor said the words about assault and interference and theft of property in a tone that was both neutral and entirely committed to getting them onto the record in the way the record likes. She said words about the jar and the hospital, and she said Jakob’s name with the K like it had always been there for her to say. The judge looked over her glasses and decided that the hospital knew how to keep him without keeping him as a forever thing and that the community had, for once, reacted without making anyone bleed, and she said she could be generous because of that alone. She set conditions that included not going to parks, not going to the hospital uninvited, not putting his hands anywhere they didn’t belong, and Alex had the strange sensation of hearing rules she had said in a rainstorm come out of a mouth that had sworn an oath.

Barbara sat in the gallery with her towel again and cried openly once, the kind of crying that looks like a person is watering something. The bailiff with the soft hand brought her a box of tissues as if it were a ritual object, and Parnell, who had come in without saying he’d come because that is how friends are sometimes, stood at the back and made his face be a wall that could hold the roof up. Eddie texted from school under his desk using the kind of speed that teachers have learned to read the way they read eyes, and he wrote, Is it over, and Alex wrote, This part, and then put her phone away because she refused to be the person who got scolded by a judge she respected.

After, in the hallway that has seen every expression a human face can make, Jakob said to Alex, “No more parks,” and she said, “No more,” and he said, “I can go to the river if I stand twenty feet away from the edge,” and she said, “You can go to the river if you go with Barbara and keep your hands in your pockets like this,” and she tucked her thumbs into her fists to show him and he mirrored her without thinking. The lawyer said, “Say nothing to no one,” and Barbara said, “Say what you want to us,” and the two rules met in the air and made a third rule that lived only within family and legal pads and could not be written down.

She went home past the church with the sneakers on Jesus and watched a kid try to teach another kid how to bunny hop and fail and then fail better and then laugh because falling is what bodies do when they’re learning and sometimes laughter lives there without anyone stealing it. The fern in her window looked like a green thing in love with its own unfolding. She took the coin out of the dish and held it and put it back and didn’t rub the Latin because she felt like she didn’t have to earn today’s sleep with words stamped by someone else in a century that didn’t have her in mind.

Late, when the city did that quiet that isn’t quiet because nothing is, she sat on the floor and told a joke to the other Alex in the window. It was a bad joke about a bicycle in a courtroom, and the other Alex laughed in spite of herself because sometimes your body is kind to you even when your brain thinks you don’t deserve it. She promised herself she would go to June’s basement with the rug the color of rain. She promised herself she would call Lila and Roxanne in a week, not to ask for anything, just to be the sound of somebody remembering them without an agenda. She promised herself she would ride the hill by the paper mill and stand on the pedals and sit when it made sense and not make a religion out of either choice.

In the morning, Barbara texted a photograph she had found in a drawer, one Jakob had taped to the wall in the storage unit and she had reclaimed when she and Alex took inventory for the paperwork. It was Isaiah with two pieces of popcorn on his tongue like a circus trick, his eyes half closed in the kind of self-amusement that saves you from making your mother mad, and behind him, out of focus, was a tree drawn on a paper taped to a window with the word When written in a child’s hand. Alex looked at it and felt something ease under her ribs. She put her bike shoes on and went out into a day that was very much not finished. She rode toward the river because that is what she does when things are bad and when they are good and when they are neither, and when she came to the water she stopped and breathed along with it and said a name out loud without making a show out of it and then did the ordinary thing of checking her light, because night comes whether you are ready or not and she intended to be seen.9 The city did not end when the cameras left the courthouse; it simply put its face back on and went to work. Fulton had no interest in being a headline except in the way all places like it want to be noticed for their best angle and not for the truths that take up so much space they can’t be cropped. By the next morning the laundromats were full of the steady slap of wet cotton, the bakery had burned one tray of rolls and forgiven itself, and somebody had propped open the door at the used bookstore with a rock that had been painted to look like a strawberry by hands that belonged to someone small. The whiteboard at the station had acquired one corner labeled Community Reassurance like the town was a skittish animal you could coax with treats, and Alex took a marker to it without rolling her eyes because there is no use having a face that lets people read your thoughts at work.

Chief Patterson parceled out assignments with her particular brand of benevolent dictatorship. Parnell and two others were told to sit in parks and pretend not to be guardians. Someone was assigned to Facebook, which meant they would spend the day ignoring their cousin’s posts about chemtrails while answering private messages that began I haven’t slept since and ended with a blurry photograph of a large man that turned out to be the new math teacher at the junior high. Alex was told to go to the high school at ten for an assembly, then to the hospital to drop off a letter, and then to City Hall to reassure councilpeople who had discovered that being elected meant exactly nothing in the face of actual grief and wanted to put up signs that said SOLVED in big friendly letters.

The gym smelled like whatever gym had ever smelled like, old rubber and effort and the ghost of oranges that no one sliced for halftime anymore because somebody had said citric acid ruins enamel and then nobody brought oranges again. The principal, a man with a tie that made you think of June skies and who had tried out for jazz band in 1989 and never really gotten over not getting a solo, introduced Alex and stepped back like he was letting a good dog into the room. The teenagers were a flock, restless in the way that sheep are restless when you imagine how they might behave if nobody told them what to do for the first time in their lives. The girl with the white bandage on her forearm was there, which made Alex’s throat tighten for a second in the way a body does when it sees a word it knows in a place it didn’t expect words at all.

She didn’t talk about jars; you don’t brand a person’s fear into their morning. She talked about consent, not like a lecture, but like a thing you keep in your pocket with your house keys. She said there is a difference between laughing with and being laughed open, and that difference is as big as the difference between a person’s hand on your back saying go ahead and a person’s hand on your back pushing. She told them to listen to the part of their brain that knows when their stomach is trying to tell them something they don’t have words for yet. She said if a man tells you that he knows better than you how to be in your own body, walk away from his idea like it’s a puddle you don’t have to step in. The kids did that thing where they pretend not to care and care very much. A boy in a sweatshirt with sleeves that had been chewed thought about how he had laughed when his friend fell because the fall was beautiful and then wondered whether the beauty required his noise. The girl with the bandage came up afterward and said, “My mom wants to sue him and also bake him a pie, and I don’t know how to live in that house,” and Alex said, “Neither does your mom,” and the girl laughed and cried at the same time, and then she put her head down for a second on Alex’s shoulder in that dangerous beautiful way teenagers do when you are not their mother and hold exactly the right amount of them.

At the hospital, she handed Delilah an envelope with language about boundaries and an apology folded inside like a paper boat— not Jakob’s apology, that would have to be earned in a room with chairs and a facilitator whose patience was a weapon; hers, for making Delilah be the second line of defense against a grief that wasn’t hers. Delilah read it at the nurses’ station amid a low chorus of beeping machines and the constant gentle violence of caretaking, and then looked up with eyes that had been trained to show only what they could afford to spend. “You tell your giant,” she said, “that if he wants to read to kids under supervision and with his hands glued to his own knees, he can come see me after the judge is done with him. He has a good voice for whispering, ridiculous as that sounds. And you—” she added, tilting her head the way women tilt their heads when they’re about to say a thing they are not technically in a role to say “—remember that not everything is your river. Sometimes your job is to show people the bridge and back away.”

City Hall wanted to talk about liability. City Hall wanted to talk about messaging. City Hall wanted to write a resolution that said the city condemned jars, and Alex stood there with her hair trying to be both professional and itself and let them feel useful without letting them build a cardboard wall between reality and their ideas. “Say his name right,” she said, when they got to the part where they wanted to call him the thing the marker had put on the board and Patterson had Xed out. “Say that we are helping families bury what was taken from them. Say that laughter is not a weapon unless you pick it up and swing it. Tell people to look out for each other without teaching them to fear men who look like my brother-in-law. If you can’t do that, don’t do anything and we’ll handle it.”

Outside, she sat on the stone bench that pretended to be a step but was only a bench and called June because she could feel the dangerous tickle behind her teeth that meant she was about to let her anger use her mouth as a trumpet. “H.A.L.T.,” June said, not smug, and Alex said, “Hungry, angry, lonely, tired: two out of four, with a side of I would like to run too far and regret it,” and June said, “Eat something if it doesn’t feel like punishment. Also, here’s a magic trick: when men say messaging what they mean is we want to be the ones to make the sounds. Tell them they can do that at Thanksgiving over gravy and get back to work.”

The union had something to say about the deputy with the taser and then changed its mind and said nothing publicly while sending three strongly worded emails privately. Patterson called the deputy into her office and did not yell at him; she didn’t have to. She drew a picture that looked like a flowchart on the back of a printout and said, “Here is you making a choice that makes me have to make a phone call. Here is you making a different choice, and look what happens: nobody has to call anybody, and I get to drink my coffee while it is still hot.” He was young enough that he believed coffee should be hot always and that believing a thing strongly could make the world yield. He left chastened and angry in the way that makes people better or worse, and Alex watched him go and felt the small ache you feel when a story branches and you can’t keep your hand on both versions to make sure the kinder one wins.

Barbara visited the station in the middle of the week with a bag of empanadas that made the whole place smell like somebody had broken the glass on a fire alarm labeled happiness and let it out. She gave Parnell a lecture about starch that made him grin like a schoolboy, and then she sat in Alex’s office and put her elbows on her knees and said, “He keeps asking me if there will be a room where he can just say names. Not to anyone. Just into the air. I told him that’s called a driveway and I have one, and he said that’s not official enough. He likes official now that it turned its face to him and spoke soft.” She pressed the towel to her eyes and then wiped the counter with it as if it had meant to have that job all along. “He wrote me a letter,” she added, and pulled it out of her purse like someone taking a bird out of a paper bag, cautious, aware of how ridiculous it looked to love a thing you had to fold. “He wrote ‘no more jars’ ten times in small letters that look like they had to learn how small is. He wrote, ‘Tell the woman with legs that I will fix the wheel on her cart if she ever gets one with a bad squeak.’ He wrote, ‘I am not the river; I am a man in a chair.’ Who knew chairs could be gospel.”

At the facility, Jakob learned the shape of routine, which for some men is a prison and for others a floating device made out of somebody else’s schedule. He woke when the lights decided he belonged to the day and not to night and took a shower in a room that had curves where corners should be because corners tempt a certain kind of mind. He watched a television with the sound off because the captions felt like someone at the bottom of a pool writing for him, which was funny in a way he kept to himself. He liked oatmeal because it asked nothing of him except a decision about raisins. He cried once at a commercial for a tire because the tire rolled away and then came back and he had been living like that. He met with a woman whose hair had been braided in a way that said, I am a person who spends time on purpose, and he told her that he had not known that his body could be gentle and dangerous at the same time and she said, “Welcome to being big,” and they laughed like conspirators, which is to say kindly.

He wrote on paper with a golf pencil and the first day he made a border around the page because he had been trying to find borders for months. He drew a tree the way boys draw trees, a trunk and a big round wad of leaves, and then he put roots on it with such concentration that the line tore the paper and the social worker said, “We’re going to get you better paper.” He asked whether there was a room where names went and she said, “There are many such rooms. There is one in your head. There is one in the chapel if you want the room to talk back. There is one in your sister’s driveway. There is one on the bridge you are not allowed to stand under alone.” He wrote ISAIAH and then erased it and then wrote it again lighter because he wanted the paper to keep it without having to shove.

Restorative justice came down the pike like a fragile bird. Patterson said the words with a cop’s skepticism and a woman’s belief that sometimes the harder thing makes the better thing later, and Alex said she would sit on the edge of the circle and not get up unless someone made it about their own bravery. The girl from the park with the bandage, an eighth-grade boy who had laughed until he gagged and then would not let anyone touch him for three days, a set of parents who made their chairs into shields, a teacher who had stood between a man and a hallway simply by knowing how hallways work, a facilitator from a college two towns over who wore the kind of sweater that makes you think of clean rooms and the right amount of light— they came to the library’s meeting room and sat in chairs that the librarian had dragged from the place where book clubs go to talk about affairs in fiction in the hope it will teach them about their own.

Jakob arrived with his hands where everyone could see them and sat exactly where the facilitator pointed and said his name in a voice that did not try to apologize for existing and also did not insist upon existing any more than necessary. He looked at the boys like a man trying to make his face into a place where those boys could stand for a minute, and then he folded his hands together and looked down because part of apology is knowing the shape of your own bigness and not throwing it like an afghan over the room. The teacher said, “When you laughed, it felt like you wanted me to perform my safety,” and Jakob nodded, and the boy said, “I like to laugh,” and Jakon said, “I like that you like to laugh,” and the boy said, “But not like that,” and Jakob said, “Not like that. I thought laughter was a magic that separated pain from the body. It turns out that is only true if you are holding your own ribs. I will not put my hands where they don’t belong ever again.” He didn’t cry because crying would have made the boys nervous. He didn’t correct any parents. He let their anger be as large and stupidly beautiful as it had to be, the way a tree lets a wind go through it and counts the branches afterward.

The newspaper sent a woman with a pad she used purely ceremonially because nobody keeps pens that work in their purse anymore, and Alex watched her not take notes and instead look at the way the facilitator said, “We put harm in the middle and build chairs around it so it has a shape and not just a direction.” The headline the next day was not a raid on nuance; it said Names, Not Monsters, which Alex cut out and taped on the inside of her locker because sometimes a small victory is exactly the size of what you needed.

Her father brought the snowblower to her building like it was a dog he’d agreed to watch and now didn’t want to give back. He muscled it out of the truck with a grunt meant to remind both of them that he had hauled heavier useless things for less good reasons, and the man in the alley who had told Alex it was a penguin came out and looked genuinely wounded to learn it was not a bird at all. “That’s what you get,” her father muttered, half amused, half offended on behalf of machinery, and then louder, “You put dry gas in here when it gets cold. I swear I taught you that. Why is there a sock on the intake.” She said, “Because a boy thought it was funny,” and he said, “Sometimes fools are engineers in disguise,” and then he looked at her and softened exactly one degree. “You looked all right on TV,” he said, trying not to say proud. “You sounded like your mother when she tells the church ladies how to cut fruit so nobody fights over the good pieces.” The penguin man asked if he could try to start it and when the engine coughed into life he whooped, and Alex’s father clapped him on the shoulder and said, “There you go, pilgrim,” which is a word he only uses on men he doesn’t feel like learning the names of.

On Saturday morning, the sky was the color of a bruise you forget how you got and she rode down to the river because despite June and Delilah and all the voices in her head she did sometimes like being next to a thing that kept going whether or not she asked it to. She found Barbara and Jakob there, together, the distance measured and mindfully stupid— twenty feet from the water, ten feet between them, his hands in his pockets like he had been told. They had a thermos that steamed politely and a bag of oranges that someone had brought because someone had told them oranges make you well. Barbara waved without moving her feet because sometimes you don’t step into someone else’s morning, you just nod at it. Jakob looked at Alex and did not smile or look away. He did a new thing she had not seen him do: he simply existed without performing his existing, and it made him look almost ordinary, like a big brother waiting out a mood on a porch because he knows the weather’s business is bigger than his.

“I have a joke,” he said, when she rolled up, and the words had the doglike eagerness of a man who knows he is offering you a stone and hoping you will praise him for it anyway. “What did the river say to the bicycle,” he asked, like a person telling a secret.

“If you say ‘water you doing here’ I will have to throw you in,” she said, and he looked delighted, which was its own joke.

“It said, ‘Keep your chain dry,’” he said, proud in the way little boys are proud when they make weather from their mouth and it sounds almost like thunder. She laughed for him because you should laugh for people who are teaching themselves how to be harmless.

June started calling her at the oddest hours like she had put the habit of calling into the same pocket as her grocery list and kept forgetting what she’d meant to get. “I am going to say a sentence and then you are going to breathe,” June would say, without preamble. “You are not responsible for all the jars you did not open. You are responsible for your two hands. If you want to make three hands out of it I will come over there and put your phone in the freezer.” Alex would breathe, because frankly she liked a woman who threatened appliances, and then she would tell June something tiny that had nothing to do with work because part of sobriety was making sure you remembered that eggs exist and your niece’s hamster wore a hat.

Her sister texted her a photograph of Maddy holding the recorder like a flute and scowling at it. “She hates the lamb,” Leah wrote. “How do we teach her scales without teaching her to live a life that never breaks rules.” Alex typed, “Teach her to play the lamb wrong until she loves it,” and Leah wrote back a heart and then, after a beat, “Are you okay,” and Alex said, “I am a person who is somewhere on a road,” and Leah wrote, “We have tangerines if you want to come smell them,” and it was its own invitation, a fruit-based truce. She went. They let her stand in the kitchen and peel one while Maddy made a noise that was almost music and almost a protest and then giggled and said, “I can do it backwards,” and did, and it sounded just as lamb-like and somehow better.

The city did what cities do: it assigned meaning to places without asking for permission. The bandstand became a spot where people said names quietly as they walked past, the storage units on Irving acquired a superstition like a draft, the bridge was less interesting to boys with spray paint because someone had used it to stand in a better kind of danger. Gale’s Salvage got three more customers who had no business needing arcade stools or brass letters but wanted to stand in a room where a woman had lifted her chin at a giant and not flinched. Gale charged them fairly and have them all exactly one story each because economy is part of ethics. She looked at Alex one afternoon over a cashbox that had bills in it arranged wrong and said, “You are going to get invited to talk at things,” as if she were warning her about a light drizzle. “Say yes, but wear shoes you can run in. There’s always a back door that needs someone to stand in it and keep smoke out.”

Spring decided to remember itself and the ash trees put out their tiny mean leaves like small flags that think too well of themselves, and the paper factory smell became less money and more sugar and didn’t make anyone less poor. The kids went back to their parks and their tricks and their cameras and their particular idiocies that will turn into stories later when they have better haircuts. Eddie learned to land a new thing and fell twice hard enough to roll and got up with the breathless brave grin of the born show-off who has learned, finally, what attention he doesn’t want. He showed Alex the video on his phone without making a big deal of whether or not she would watch the whole minute and she watched the whole minute and the one after, and when he said, “You still going to be a cop when you’re forty,” she said, “I’m going to be a woman when I’m forty. The rest is a hat,” and he looked at her as if she had told him a trick about the world that might come in handy on days when the air is too heavy to push.

The court date settled like a bird on a branch that had been moving all day. The mothers came and wore their griefs better this time because they fit more like sweaters and less like wet towels. The prosecutor said what prosecutors say when they have decided they are going to try to make the law not break anybody else’s day, and the judge said what judges say when they have seen every version of this story and keep their hope in a drawer with their gavel. There were conditions that meant actual work; there was a program that involved men learning to put their hands on table edges instead of other people; there was a community service that involved chairs in back rooms where folding chairs go to breed and despair. Jakob listened like a person being told where the path is from the place where he had wandered off into the high grass. He looked at Alex only once and it was not to ask her to approve— it was to say silently that he had memorized a new rule without being asked to and was proud in the right way.

On a Sunday, she and her father fixed a hinge on her mother’s pantry door that had screamed for years and her mother had convinced herself to hear as a warning instead of as brokenness. Her father held the screwdriver with a concentration that he reserved for small acts that made big differences and said, without looking up, “I didn’t go because I didn’t know how to be loud without making it about me,” about the race, finally, the one that lived between them like a piece of furniture they bump into at night and pretend not to know. She kept her face in the screws and said, “Okay,” and he said, “It wasn’t okay then and it’s not okay now but that’s what I did,” and she said, “Okay,” again, because there is a mercy in not forcing a confession to pay you back with immediate usefulness. Later, Maddy played something that wasn’t the lamb and accidentally beautiful, and her mother asked if she had eaten, and her father wrapped leftovers in foil with the care of a surgeon, and the house, for once, felt like a boat headed in a direction everyone had agreed upon without a fight.

At night, sometimes, Alex rode down to the river and did nothing except lean and breathe and think of nothing that had nouns. The light on her handlebars made a small clean circle that she could believe in. Once she saw a boy and his mother standing at the edge saying nothing and not crying and she kept riding because some silences need witnesses and some silences need space around them like lace. Once she saw Parnell holding a coffee he was never going to finish and looking at his reflection in the glass as if he were auditioning for a life he may yet get, and she didn’t say anything because you don’t force a man to narrate the quiet parts. Once she saw a gull pick up a piece of popcorn someone had dropped and fight with it like it had moral implications, and she laughed aloud alone because sometimes your body is kind without asking permission.

She stopped waking with the image of a jar every day. When she did wake with it, it was a snow globe again, a tiny mechanical weather that made everything look smaller and less real, and she would put her feet on the floor and open the window and make the real air go through her small apartment so her lungs had something to argue with. She stopped being the person everybody called first. She let Parnell take a few meetings and watched him do fine. She let June listen to someone else’s confession some nights. She let the girl with the bandage text her a sticker of a tree with five spokes like she had invented some private language and did not require a response. She let the city keep some of its own secrets. She allowed herself to be one kind of wall and one kind of bridge and no more; she allowed herself to laugh at a bad joke about snitches and machines and to love the way her legs looked like instruments rather than explanations.

On the day the paper printed a photograph of the boys’ headstones with their new dates added on the small plaques, she rode to the cemetery and stood beside the place where the grass had been cut twice since the small white boxes went into the ground. She did not touch anything. She did not say anything out loud. She counted to seventy because that is how long a minute is when you want it to be longer and then to seventy again because sometimes you are allowed to be greedy with time. On her way out, she saw the groundskeeper sitting on a low wall, eating a sandwich with more lettuce than any man puts on a sandwich on purpose, and he said, without looking at her, “That machine of Gale’s made a better noise than church that day. You tell her I said so,” and Alex said, “I will,” and then did, because you carry small sentences like that like coins and spend them as soon as you can so they end up where they were meant to go.

There were still fights. A man yelled at her in the grocery store because he had decided she was responsible for everything with sirens. The deputy with the taser had a moment in a parking lot where he thought he saw something that wasn’t there and grabbed for a thing he’d been told he couldn’t have anymore, and Patterson put him on desk duty and then took him to coffee and said, “You’re going to be fine or you’re going to go do something else; both are a kind of mercy.” A letter arrived at the station from a woman in a town with a lake who wrote in big loopy handwriting that her niece giggled when the dentist put the gas on and she wanted to know whether that meant anything, and Alex wrote back with a pen that actually worked and said, “It means your niece’s body is an animal that is finding ways to love itself; tell the dentist to be kind.”

June took her to a meeting in a church where the floorboards understood things that tile never will. A man told a story about laughing at his father’s funeral in the third pew from the front because the carpet had a pattern that looked like ducks if you stared long enough, and Alex laughed and then cried and then laughed because crying is often a hallway and laughter is occasionally a door at the end of it. After, June walked her around the block and said, “You understand you’re allowed to leave town someday if you want,” and Alex said, “I know,” and meant it in the new way, not as a threat but as a fact that didn’t have to be deployed to exist.

Under the bridge one afternoon where the water hoarded secret green, Jakob stood with Barbara and said a name very quietly and then said no more jars and then said nothing at all. He had a list of places he wasn’t allowed to go and a list of days when he had to show up and let someone in a sweater ask him about anger, and he had a popcorn machine he wasn’t allowed to touch and was never going to anyway because it had become a thing he worshiped by leaving alone. He had started to carry a small notebook where he wrote sentences that were either prayers or instructions, and the difference mattered less and less. On the first page he had written When we are lions in a child’s hand that was his and wasn’t, and underneath, in small careful letters that didn’t tear the paper, he wrote We take care of the cubs first.

In the evenings, as spring unwound itself and the city took off its coat and stood in the doorway just for the pleasure of feeling the light, Alex rode. She stood on the pedals halfway up the hill by the paper mill because sitting felt like an apology that day. She coasted with one hand off the bar like a kid because remembering that you have balance you didn’t earn today is a kindness you can give yourself for free. She stopped on the bridge because you can never be done stopping on the bridge and because the river had learned to be quiet for a while and she wanted to see whether it remembered how. The other Alex in the window of the dark water looked back and did not raise an eyebrow. She hooked her finger into her bell and didn’t ring it and thought about how sometimes you get to build your own floor in the air and stand on it. She thought about bicycles and chairs and hands and the way people set jars down, and she laughed, low and ordinary, because the day had made room for it, and because for once, it belonged only to her.
