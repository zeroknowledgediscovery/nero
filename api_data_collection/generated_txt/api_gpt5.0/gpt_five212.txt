The first time anyone in Naperville spoke the name Abbi aloud, it was whispered at a vigil with paper cups of cooling coffee and a flecking of candle wax on the church sidewalk. A mother said it. She didn’t mean to give the word shape, but she wanted her grief to stick to something, and the rumor—how else do rumors grow but with mouths and breath?—needed a surface. So Abbi became a person again, not merely the crease in the corner of a photograph or a nocturne in the cornfields; the name was passed from heart to heart, humming like static behind closed doors.

It started, as these things often do, with a peculiar kindness. A bouquet on the stoop of a doctor’s office. Not the sweet, forgiving kind of bouquet either. A chaos of wild asters and thistles, twined with twine, smelling faintly like iron after a rainfall. The receptionist brought them in and laughed nervously. “No card,” she said, though of course there was one, if you knew where to look—scrawled under the raffia on the underside of the glass vase, a small hand had etched the letters with a safety pin: LOVE.

Abbi was already in the city then, though no one was looking for her yet. She slipped in through the frost cracks between the yards, through the makeshift corridors of alleys where bins grow fat on a Thursday evening, through the deeper dark under the commuter rail bridge west of Washington Street. She was short and narrower than anyone remembered being, but her shoulders had a gravity to them, and her head, tilted to listen at odd angles, made people remember a painful tune they couldn’t place, a lullaby you might hear once and then would never stop humming under your breath when you thought you were alone.

She loved like a forest loves fire: indiscriminately, consuming, leaving a pain that smelled clean. It wasn’t desire in the ordinary sense. It was the desire to keep. Once she loved, she could not bear to let a thing change. Hair grows; nails grow; bodies age and go slack and creak and splay. She came from someplace, once—cave, culvert, womb of concrete, wherever the heat signature of something lost and animal had left its mark—and she learned about keeping from the river that pretended to flow but was in fact only moving in place.

In the mornings, she would sit on the old culvert’s lip and watch the commuters skim past in their cars, faces in tight parentheses, eyes hooded with focus. Sometimes she would raise a hand. Once, a boy in the back seat waved back, live with curiosity, and Abbi felt the jerk of a new love, sharp as winter. But he went on, became a dot, became forgettable in the way all moving things flicker and go out. He had no smell of ether or disinfectant; he had not yet been anointed by the hospital air. She was patient. She waited.

If this sounds like a fable, it is because Lady Lindy had not yet arrived.

Lindy Gallagher—though if you asked for Lady Lindy, everyone would know who you meant—kept an umbrella in each of her two offices and in the trunk of her car, and none of them ever seemed to work when rain came. The brass tip bent on one, the springs outstripped on another, the third caught like a rabbit in a wire trap. She consulted on estates and disputes and once, disastrously, on a case that had something to do with a nursing home’s outstanding balances and someone’s mother’s earrings that had simply ceased to exist between the Tuesday morning bathing and the Wednesday morning bed change. When she lost, she became news at the dinner table of her own family, and not the warm kind. Respect, her father had once said, is an investment you make with your actions. They’d bought shares in her future and watched the yield plummet. Estrangement is its own market, bear forever.

She was not nobility, not in any way that counts in a country where old titles are ghosts that need passports. Her brother had given her the “Lady” when they were children and she once stood on the overturned milk crate in the garage and arbitrated, with absurd gravity, a neighborhood dispute about a stolen kite. It stuck because she wore it lightly and then because she wore it not at all, a crown made of yarn and rainwater. She loved napkins, and case law, and the quiet grill of the pen on the yellow pad when the office was empty.

When the first doctor was found, Lindy was alphabetizing wills.

She had the radio on low and a sandwich she’d eaten only half of, not because she wasn’t hungry but because the half reminded her of that tiny decent ritual of saving. The phone call was not the kind she’d ever gotten before. It came from a detective who barely knew how to pronounce her name, and who asked her if she had any availability to consult, not on a legal matter exactly, but on something that had edges she might recognize.

“I’m not a criminal lawyer,” she said, and then braced for the familiar dismissal.

The detective said, “I know that. We need someone who can talk to people who otherwise will not be talked to. The families. And there’s the hospital counsel already crawling all over the scene. You speak their language. And the other one.”

“What other one is that?” she asked.

“The one that people use when they don’t know how to say I’m scared.”

Lindy waited.

“Are you free?” the detective said, and when she hesitated, he added, “It’s about a doctor.”

She thought of her mother at the kitchen table, linoleum shining like a cold lake. Don’t take on more, her mother had said to her, years ago, when the case load was eating her sleep. The grocery budget was a thing you could see; respect was a ledger you couldn’t. The ring of the phone felt like warning and invitation both. It was not, strictly, her lane. But lanes, she’d found, were painted by people who had never had to get to the other side before dark.

“Send me the address,” she said. “And tell me your name.”

“Det. Ruiz,” he said. “Most people just say Rook. The second o has a line through it in my head.”

“I see,” she said, not seeing at all but liking the confession.

“Bring something warm,” he said. “It’s a drafty building.”

The drafty building was a clinic off Ogden, set back from the road, with a flag that forgot itself in the wind and a sign that made the word Family look stern. There was police tape in a tired fan across the door, not because anyone needed to be kept out—the curious had not yet figured out where to be curious—but because ritual is how people certify that something terrible has been recognized. The air was damp with the recent hum of ventilators and the kind of cleaning solutions that make the nose sting and the teeth feel thin. Rook met her by the reception desk, where someone with careful hands had slid the candy dish full of old mints under a clipboard as if tidying were part of grief.

“You’re not on the clock for us,” he said, gesturing with one shoulder toward a young woman in scrubs who had her palms flat on the laminate counter as if the laminate were an altar. “But if you’re here, you’re useful.”

Lindy nodded. “What happened?”

“They came in to open. They found Dr. Weller in Exam Four. No obvious cause, and we’re not going to discuss the other thing with the reporters when they arrive.”

“What other thing?” she asked, though she’d heard a slant of it already in the parking lot, from the mouth of a man with a leaf blower who had shut his machine off and let the silence tell us everything it could not.

“His hair. Removed. Clean. And not just his head,” Rook said, and looked at her to see how she would take it.

She took it like a lawyer. “And you think that is—what, some kind of message?”

“I think it’s a detail. And you collect details like berries and see which ones stain.”

“Who will I be talking to?” she asked.

Rook touched the brim of a hat he wasn’t wearing, a magician’s reflex. “The receptionist. The nurse. A woman who says she is Dr. Weller’s wife, though they’ve been separated for almost a year. And someone who left flowers yesterday and left a name with the security camera by accident.”

“Accident?”

Rook smiled without his eyes doing any of the work. “People think cameras can’t see names. They forget the other senses a building has. And we have someone else.”

“Someone else?”

“A rumor with feet,” Rook said. “We don’t chase rumors, but they tend to walk into the places you don’t want them. Her name is Abbi. You may hear it. If you do, don’t repeat it without thinking. Names stick.”

The nurse’s name was Margarita, and she had a voice that would have made better weather if it could. She told Lindy that Dr. Weller was meticulous and kind and had once returned a toddler’s stuffed rabbit from the back of a visiting room chair as if he were returning a lost passport. She told her that the doctor had enemies only in the way good people have enemies: those who misunderstand the cost of kindness. “And he had hair like a priest,” she said, then looked guilty, as if she’d spoken out of turn, as if hair were sacrosanct.

“Did you see anyone unusual in the last week?”

“Unusual like how?” Margarita asked. “Unusual is everyone, you work in a clinic. Unusual is Wednesday.”

“Unusual like someone who behaved as if the building were a person they owed something to.”

Margarita blinked. “There was a girl. Not a girl, not exactly. Small. She had the look of someone who had walked to the door and then had to teach her feet how to cross the threshold.”

“What did she want?” Lindy said.

“She didn’t look at me. She looked at the floor. She had a hat on—a knit cap, too warm for the day—and when I told her the doctor was not taking new patients she turned as if her shoulder held the whole world’s hinge. She said thank you. It sounded like a promise.”

“What did she smell like?” Lindy said, and regretted it immediately. It was a cruel and useless question. But Margarita surprised her.

“Leaves,” she said slowly. “And the place under the bridge. Like water that has been listening to cars all day.”

When Lindy stepped into Exam Four with Rook, the room had already done the thing rooms do for the dead: become more grounded than they had been. Things had weight and seam. There was a jacket on the hook that would never be shrugged on again. There were shelves with pamphlets about heart health and how to talk to your children about their changing bodies. There was, unbearably, the stool with its worn top and its polite twirling that invited conversation. The body had been removed. There was no red, only the absence. Clean. Scrupulous. The trash can was empty. The sink had no story to tell in its bowl.

“The cameras?” Lindy said.

“Over the door. Over the back hall. None in here. None in the changing closet. We have regulations.”

“You have blind corners.”

“We have blind corners,” Rook agreed. “All of us do.”

“Who found him?”

“The receptionist. She went to put on a kettle in the break room and smelled something. Not foul. Sweet. Flowers gone wrong. She came back and tried the doors, and this one was not locked and that was not right. She didn’t go in. She called us.”

“Good,” Lindy said. She felt the familiar current of calm that comes when there is something to be done and you are allowed to do it without having to explain yourself first. It was almost joy. She would not name it that. She had learned not to name things too early.

Rook was watching her watch the room. “You think this is about doctors,” he said.

“You just told me it was a doctor,” she said.

“I mean you think it’s about them, as in the why.”

“Yes,” she said. “This would not be happening if Dr. Weller had been a butcher or a postman.”

“Why not a butcher?” Rook asked, genuinely.

“Because butchers do not bring their hands home in the same way. Because doctorhood is a thing that attaches to a person’s name and sticks like a second skin. Because the person who did this was arguing with something that is not merely a person, but a role. And because hair, in our culture, is a claim. You remove it and you are saying, I took your claim from you.”

“Hair grows back,” said Rook.

“When it can,” Lindy said.

They looked at the empty stool together. The silence had no ease in it.

“Do you want to see the card?” Rook said. “The one on the flowers. The underside.”

They were in the evidence room, a room as small as a sigh, when Lindy saw the scrawl. Love, it said. Not even the uppercase kind. A child’s hesitant hand, but not a child’s letters. Letters that had been learned in a place where letters were not expected to go. She did not like to think of that. She did not like to think of lessons made in cold. She ran her thumbnail over the edge of the photograph and felt her skin catch on a roughness that had nothing to do with what any camera had captured.

“Abbi,” Rook said, as if admitting a scratch under his shirt he could not stop thinking about. “It’s not a name we give to girls anymore. It’s almost sweet. It makes the mind go to storybooks.”

“She is a storybook,” Lindy said, and then shook her head because the last thing you want is to give an idea like that the invitation to sit down and plant its elbows.

“Tell me about your mother,” Rook said abruptly.

“My mother?” Lindy blinked.

“Is she on good terms with doctors?”

“She is a nurse,” Lindy said. “She thinks doctors are necessary the way bones are necessary. And she thinks nurses hold the world together while people with degrees get the credit.”

Rook nodded. “My aunt says the same.”

“You could have asked me if I had any animus toward doctors myself,” Lindy said, watching him watch her.

“I have to ask you weirder questions before I can ask you that one,” he said amiably. “Otherwise people get into their grooves and they give me their rehearsed answers.”

“Ask me,” she said.

“Do you have any animus toward doctors?”

“No,” she said. “Except when they speak to me like I am furniture. I don’t like anyone who tells me I exist to place their cups on.”

Rook grunted. “Fair.”

Back under the bridge, Abbi watched a duck paddle in a circle, the same circle, the way it must, the way instinct is intimate with geometry. She had a comb with four teeth missing. She had a rag she had stolen from a laundromat’s forgotten basket. She washed, as she had always washed, with diligence and reverence, as if water itself were an authority and she could curry favor. She hummed nothing that had ever been a song.

She loved Dr. Weller. She had loved him from the moment he stood in a doorway two weeks before with his head tilted and his mouth softened by something that might have been weariness or mercy. She loved him because he had not seen her as a category. He had stood the way a person stands when they are ready to receive. She could not go forward then; love sometimes makes the feet ridiculous. She had stolen the hat off a display in a thrift store so that when she did move, she could bring herself to him like a gift disguised inside another gift. She did not want to keep his hair, not really. That toy, that trophy, was only a thing to put in place of a thing she could not name, could not hold. Love, said the card, because she needed a word and the world had only provided her with that one.

No one had loved her back for longer than it takes a streetlight to cycle. People were fond, sometimes. They offered her a muffin and then took it back without meaning to, with their eyes when they landed on her hands. She was neat as a seam, but hands tell the truth. Hers had stories from the small days. And she was not built to be looked at long. The world is too quick with its wanting to sit long with anyone who does not mirror back a version of the same. She learned to love things that were constant and warm and that never scolded: the breath of elevators in buildings she could not safely enter, the throb of the highway at two in the morning when it goes from furious to thoughtful, the way snow sits in gutters and decides if it is a garment or a glide.

Love makes rules. Love gives orders. Love says, be still. Stay. Stop changing. Love stands in a doorway and says, you are only safe if I say the word. Love wants to brush you down to something gleaming and simple. She did not think this, even in the marrow where her thinking had gotten good at going when it could not climb into her head. But the hand that held the comb knew.

“Someone left flowers,” she told the duck. The duck bobbed, not understanding or understanding more than anyone else would have. “They always leave flowers when they want to remember something. Doesn’t work. They think it helps, but it’s the water that holds, not the stem. And the stems will dry.”

In the wake of a death, a town bristles and then mellows. The first few days are a parade of prying and police presence. After that comes the whispering and the little acts—the casseroles, the long silences at the ends of phone calls. Lindy watched this happen with Dr. Weller. She watched as his wife Lizzie took off her wedding ring and put it on again three times in one minute, like a baby trying to learn wakefulness. She watched Margarita go back to work and wash her hands as if this were the only honest act left to her in the world. She watched Rook mutter into a second cup of coffee and draw boxes on scrap paper that did not add up to anything tidy.

“Why would anyone shave him?” Lizzie asked the third day, in a voice that made the walls wince. “Why would anyone do that to him? He was not a man who thought about hair.”

“He was a man,” said someone, not unkindly. “That is always a reason for something. For some things.”

“It was a taking,” Lindy said softly, mostly to herself.

“What did he take?” Lizzie said, her mouth twisting.

“Not him. The person who did this,” Lindy said, but she did not go on, because sometimes not speaking is a way of being useful to the living.

The second doctor was older. He had drawn hands on scraps of paper while listening to patients talk, to keep his mind in the room. There were a dozen of these hands in a small box on his desk, and when they found him in his own office after hours, the box was tipped and the hands were in a careless fan on the floor like pressed leaves. The building’s guard had heard a humming down the hall at around seven. He had told no one because humming, like whistling, is not a crime, and because he was old and humming reminded him of a woman from before he had bones that woke him at four in the morning for no good reason.

His hair was gone, too. Not gone in a ravaged way. Gone in a careful way, as if someone had a gentle task and executed it with devotion. There was no love card that time. On the wall in the break room, someone had scrawled between two magnets holding up a poster about vaccinations: STAY.

When Lindy saw it, she pressed her mouth into her wrist so the noise she made had somewhere private to go.

“She wants to stop time,” she said to Rook. “She wants to fix them in place like photographs.”

“Photographs get old,” Rook said. “They curl at the edges. They go tea-brown in the wrong light.”

“She knows,” Lindy said. “That’s why she keeps removing the part that insists on stitching time together. Hair is a calendar. She thinks she can cancel the date by cutting out the page.”

“And the doctors?” Rook said.

“They are arguments with mortality,” Lindy said, and in saying it felt the little flare in her chest, the one that said her brain liked this work and her brain did not care what other parts of her life had paid for it.

After the second body, the rumor grew legs and, worse, the rumor had a face. Faces are unkind; they make myths too easy to hate. “She’s a goblin,” said a boy at a gas station, with the kind of certainty boys have when they’ve just discovered the uses of fear. “Not a real goblin. I mean, she’s goblin-y. My cousin saw her. She had teeth. And she walked like this.” He hunched and shivered and threw his shoulders forward, a mimicry of predators learned from cartoon sharks.

“Goblin,” repeated a woman behind him as if testing the syllables for poison. “We don’t have goblins. We have girls without homes. They get called goblins when we don’t want to look at them.”

“They say she smells like the bridge,” the boy insisted. “They say she leaves flowers.”

“Everyone leaves flowers,” the woman said, picking up her lottery ticket and her milk.

Abbi listened, of course. Abbi heard more than was said anywhere near her. She had a knack for listening to the way someone’s shoes spoke for them when they walked away. She knew what “goblin” meant. It meant small, not quite right, hard to love, easy to blame. It meant old fear wearing new lipstick. She didn’t mind the word. She had other words. Creature, sometimes, when she felt more animal than girl. Lover, when she felt brave enough to name herself by what she wanted most.

Love is a muscle. It grows stronger in one direction or another with practice. If your love is the kind that never releases its hand, the grip only grows stronger the more the hand beneath it tries to twist away. Abbi’s grip had been trained by loss. It was not her fault. It was her fault.

It was a Friday when Lindy went to see her mother. The visit was unannounced, which meant her mother would be in her robe and would be irritated and then would thaw and then would become briefly cruel—like critics who write kinder when they write faster—and then would ask if she was seeing anyone, which was less romance than ritual. The road south skates past storefronts that have changed names as many times as a guilty man, and the parking lot of the grocery store had a new patch of asphalt dark as a bruise.

Her mother kept a small radio under the lip of the kitchen counter, and the news had the story in it: second doctor, unusual details, no suspects. Her mother turned the knob off as if she were pulling the plug on a machine in an ICU.

“Working on that?” she asked, stabbing a finger at the blank air where the report had been.

“Yes,” Lindy said.

“You are not a cop,” her mother said. “You have a job that is not that.”

“I know,” Lindy said.

“Your brother says you like it when the river is high,” her mother said. “You like when everything has to change a little to let the water by.”

“Is that what he said?” Lindy said, smiling against her better judgment. “Your son says a lot of things about me. Is he ever wrong?”

“He’s in Iowa,” her mother said, as if geography were an ethic. “He keeps ducks.”

“Ducks,” said Lindy. “Old prayer.”

“Do not chase this goblin,” her mother said suddenly, as if the word had been evicted from her mouth. “It will not make your father forgive you.”

“I am not chasing it,” Lindy said, and knew the verb was wrong even as it left her. “I am—I am trying to keep something worse from happening.”

“That’s what you always say,” her mother said.

“Maybe because it’s always true,” Lindy said, and immediately wished she’d let the room have the quiet.

Her mother poured water into a pot and turned on the gas and watched the small bloom of blue with a reverence that almost made Lindy love her so hard she could have put her head in her lap like a child. The old tenderness is the hardest thing to resist. She had once been the kind of girl who could fall asleep at the kitchen table between bites, and her mother would put two fingers on her forehead and push back, not roughly, just enough to rearrange her. Now her mother held her at arms’ length with words.

“You will come back for dinner on Sunday,” her mother said. “Your father is making comments about the roast that would please you if you could manage to be pleased by anything he says. And you will bring your umbrellas in from the car because if I open that trunk again and see three broken things, I will scream.”

“I can promise the first,” Lindy said. “The second is a miracle. Miracles are not what we do.”

Her mother made a noise that was half scoff and half laugh. “You do not know what you do. That is your problem. You think your problem is that you do not like to stop.”

“Both are true,” Lindy said, gentler.

“Eat an egg,” her mother said. “Then go and hunt your stories. But do not bring any of them in my house.”

On Saturday, Abbi watched a parade. Naperville loves its pageantry. Band uniforms, a funnily tall man on stilts, a dog with a neckerchief that said adopt, girls with batons that looked like knives until the light caught them and their shine was harmless. She watched from the shade of a maple whose roots had created upheaval in the sidewalk concrete that made strollers stumble, and no one cursed the tree. They only corrected. Trees always get a pass. Abbi was fond of that.

She liked the sound of drums when they are far away. Close, they frighten the ribs. Far, they are like the heartbeat of something polite. A man next to her lifted his daughter up onto his shoulders and the girl’s legs gripped his chest like a clutch. He had a doctor’s hands, though that is probably a cruel thing to say. They were clean in a way that looks like they’d been taught how to be clean in school. His hair was thick and delighted in itself. He had, plainly, no idea what his own body said from six feet away to a stranger with a comb in her pocket.

Abbi put her comb away and retreated without being seen. The parade wheeled and funneled and scattered and left glitter on the street, and the glitter would be there tomorrow and the next day and the next. Those pieces of brightness always outlive their purpose. That comforted her.

Two nights later, the third happened. In a hospital this time, which was brazen or inevitable. He was a resident, which is the saddest word in medicine, as if a person has unclipped their name and replaced it with a door tag. He had fallen asleep at a desk, head angled in a way that would hurt a chiropractor to look at, and when nurses later could not wake him, they called and called and then they had to call people whose shoes made hard statements on the floor. There was again no gore. There were clippings in the biohazard bin that were not biohazard. Rules are hard in the dark.

By then, the town was a room of eyes. “Where is this goblin in the day?” a man at the hardware store asked, half mocking, half hiding how he now double-locked his doors. The clerk said, sensible, “Same place as you, probably. Not doing anything anyone would notice.” The man said, “If she’s a she,” and the clerk said, “Everything that is a trouble is a she in your house,” and he laughed and it was enough to make the air not so tense for a minute.

The hospital hired a consulting security firm in pointy shoes and crisp shirts, polite as knives. They held a meeting where the words synergy and best practices and accountability were used so often that they lost all ballast. Lindy attended because she wanted to hear the route of ridiculousness; she’d learned that sometimes the thing you need to catch is clinging to the underside of a table everyone else has their feet on.

After, she found Rook lingering in the hall by the vending machines. He was watching a bag of peanuts shudder its way down the spiral and jam halfway. He had bought them only to demonstrate to a younger officer that machines are a metaphor.

“She’s going to make a mistake,” Rook said.

“She already has,” Lindy said.

“Which one?”

“She’s made herself a story,” Lindy said. “Stories like this eat their authors.”

Rook nodded, then gestured at the disappearing peanuts. “In the meantime, we get to watch the same small injustices over and over again.”

“You’re a poet,” Lindy said.

“I write on walls in pencil,” Rook said. “The cleaning crew erases me. I thank them. No one needs my epigrams when there’s actual milk to be spilled.”

There was a lull, the kind that comes when a storm rescinds itself without apology. That is, of course, when terrible things are most mobile. People nap in lulls. People soften. People make what they want to believe into a pillow. Abbi moved in those days with a kind of ache that looked like grace. She had begun to realize something that made her hands shake when she washed them: there was no afterward in the love she had made. She had waited all her small life to bring about an afterward that kept everything as it was, and she had made a series of nowheres. The doctors were not in time anymore. She had shaved them into statues and the statues had nowhere to stand. Once you take a head’s memory of its own warmth, there is no way to give it back.

She did not know the word remorse. Her mouth did not know how to shape it, but her body did: it made itself small and it did not sleep when it should. Under the bridge, she lay with her eyes open and watched the headlights ribbon under the arch and thought the word family, not because she had one but because people said it like it was a place you could go.

It was a morning of soft rain when Lindy followed a path beneath the commuter rail where the graffiti had layers like sediment. She had no reason to go there except for the way her eyes had been pulled toward the narrow in the map of the city. Cities have arteries; she had learned to trace them with her finger the way a mother traces the outline of a child’s ear when pretending to be soothing. She had on boots that were not meant for mud and a coat that had once been her father’s on Saturdays. She had no weapon and no badge. She had a thermos with coffee gone cynical.

She did not say Abbi aloud because Rook had told her not to and because she knew names are doors that may open inward when you are pressing outward with all your might. She did say, softly, “I am here to talk,” because that is what you say in her business when you are not sure whether the person across from you wants to be there at all.

Abbi heard the word talk the way a raccoon hears the rattle of kibble in a bowl. She peeked with one eye around the glistening concrete. She saw a woman who looked like a window you could see through and then also not. She saw the outline of the thermos and the way the woman’s hands were doing nothing in particular, which is as careful as a person can be with their hands.

“I was told not to say your name,” Lindy said, into the bright emptiness under the bridge. “So I won’t. I will say mine. Lindy. You can call me that. Or nothing. Or you can not call me at all.”

Abbi did not answer. The ducks answered. One gave a little belch, as if to take it upon itself to make the moment less solemn.

“I know what you want,” Lindy went on. “I don’t mean the particulars. I mean the shape. You want to keep something. You want to make it stay. I understand that like I understand hunger. My father is a man who thinks respect is small change. I keep trying to put coins in his palm and he keeps dropping them on the floor so he can say I made the noise. I would keep that moment, if I could, the one before he lets go. I would keep it and live there. But it would be a lie. It would be a room with no air in it. I know you think love can make rooms breathe. It can’t, not that way.”

A small sound came from the shadows that might have been human. It might have been a sigh. It might have been a bat wing adjusting itself.

Lindy sat on the wet lip of the culvert, not caring about her coat, because you can only care about so many things at once. She had decided which things today: breath. Silence. The small.

“There’s a man named Rook who will not say your name either,” she said. “He is tired in a way that the rest of his face cannot seem to catch up with. He would catch you if he had to. He does not want to have to. The people in charge of papers and meetings will try to make this into a conference table problem. It is not. It is a tiny room problem. It is a talking problem. It is a finally being heard problem.”

Abbi’s toes were curled inside shoes that had once belonged to someone who walked a white dog that wanted only to be looked at. She listened to the woman say words that had the soft of truth in them, and she did not step forward because stepping forward means you are now in a story where you have an opposite. She had never been good at that.

“Do you know what will happen if you keep on?” Lindy said. “The love will make you smaller. It seems unfair, but it does. You will be so small you will think you can slip under the door and be safe. Doors do not save you. People do. People do, when they can. You have made it very hard to let people do what they could do for you.”

Abbi thought of the comb. She thought of the way it had behaved so well for her. She thought of the way her hand had been faithful. She thought of the men in their coats, of the hair that made a ring around nothing. She thought of the word goblin and the word love and how they both had a softness to them that made her mouth happy and her stomach ill.

“You cannot keep them as they were in the moments you loved them,” Lindy said finally, as the rain did its small consolations all around them. “And even if you could, they would not be them. They would be something awful and still.”

From the shadow came a voice at last, strange with disuse and also with old songs under it. “I am trying to make it stop,” Abbi said. “I am trying to make it stay.”

Lindy did not turn her head all the way. She did not want to spook the moment.

“I know,” she said.

“It hurts,” Abbi said. “The way things move. The way you can love and then the loving changes and the thing changes and then you are alone and you still have all of it like a shirt that smells like rain but the rain is nowhere.”

“Yes,” said Lindy, because sometimes yes is the only medicine.

“I did not mean for anyone to die,” Abbi said, and then her voice broke around the word die and she made a sound like a spoon on a plate.

Lindy closed her eyes. “You did not mean it,” she said softly. “But meaning is not the same as doing. There are people who will not care about your meaning. I am here because I do. And because I think it can change how this ends.”

Abbi took one step forward. She was not wearing a hat, and the hair on her head had been cut short, jaggedly, by someone who did not own a mirror and had not yet made friends with the blade. She was smaller than monsters are when you are told to fear them. She was larger than someone ought to be if they had starved.

“Hello, Lindy,” she said. The sound of her name in that mouth made Lindy shiver, not with fear, but with the terrible intimacy of being seen by the story you are telling.

“We can walk,” Lindy said softly. “We can talk somewhere that is not under a bridge. Or we can stay here. I do not mind the water. I do not mind the sound of cars.”

Abbi shook her head, a bird quickness. “You will take me to places that are for punishment.”

“Eventually,” Lindy said, and did not lie. “But there are places first that are for listening. The man named Rook will help make that happen because he is tired and because he knows he is not the only tired person. You can tell them what you meant. You can tell them you did not want to ruin anything; you wanted to fix it. You can say the words you did not know how to say then.”

Abbi tilted her head. “It won’t bring them back,” she said.

“No,” Lindy said. “Nothing will. That is the part I cannot fix.”

Abbi came close enough that Lindy could see the small scar at the edge of her mouth that looked like someone had once tried to teach her to smile by drawing the line farther than it was meant to go. She smelled like leaves and like the place under the bridge. She smelled like old rain.

“I am tired,” Abbi said simply.

“I know,” Lindy said, and then because you have to be brave only one second at a time, and then you can rest, she reached out and Abbi did not flinch. She put her umbrellaless hand on the small shoulder and felt the bones say we were here we were here we were here.The way back to the street felt longer than the way down, which is a small joke the earth plays when it wants to make sure everyone is paying attention. Lindy did not take her hand from Abbi’s shoulder, not because she imagined the girl would flee, but because the line of contact kept the talk from skidding. She told her about the curb at the top of the path that liked to grab ankles and the convenience store whose door stuck in summer and the policeman who would be waiting and would try to make his face be a field not a wall. She told her about the thermos, offered it, and when Abbi shook her head, she did not insist, simply sipped and made a face at the taste as if the coffee had betrayed them both. Every few steps a car went by, and each time Abbi’s head tilted, as if greeting something older than both of them that moved in bright skin and smelled like hot rubber. Her shoes made a wet federal case of the mud and then, once the concrete took over, made a noise like a child trying not to cry. It is a certain kind of grace to agree to be seen. It is another to practice the small logistics of surrender: to walk up from the water toward walls and paper and people who think they know what to do with you.

Rook was where he said he would be when she sent the text with just three letters, the ones they’d agreed upon in a stolen minute in a hall where the vending machine had failed them. He had his hat in his hand because sometimes you make a country out of gestures and live there to remind yourself you can be decent. He did not walk forward; he took two steps back, which is what good men do when they know the person in front of them has spent their whole life learning where not to stand. “There will be hard rooms,” he said to Abbi, and his voice did that surprising thing and warmed without wheedling. “There will be people who do not know where to put their eyes. I am asking you to come anyway.” Abbi’s chin made a small brother of a nod, and her hands moved the way hands do when they are negotiating with their wrists about how to be themselves. She looked at Lindy not for permission but for inventory, as if taking stock of how much air is left in a tank, and then she looked at Rook and did not flinch when he did what he could not help doing, which was look back.

At the station there is always a clock that is wrong, and the wrongness is a tonic for some and a torment for others. Lindy found herself watching the minute hand lag and then leap, and she thought of the men with the rings of absence where their hair had been, and her stomach pulled in a way that had nothing to do with hunger. They did not put Abbi in a room with a mirror pretending not to be a window; they put her in the small break room with the bulletin board that said softball and potluck and someone’s child’s school fundraiser in markers that had nearly run out. This is a decision, not an accident. Rook put a cup on the table that had held other cups and showed her the sink whose tap squealed halfway and then calmed down if you were patient. He asked her if she would like to wash her hands and she said yes and did so with a concentration that made the tap behave as if it were honored. Lindy sat in a chair with a wobble in one leg and did not try to fix it. Sometimes the restless thing is the only thing keeping a room true.

“What do you need to tell me first?” Rook asked, and he did not have a recorder on the table, and when Abbi’s eyes flicked to the door as if looking for the ghost of an official thing, he lifted his palms to show he would conjure nothing she had not been warned about. He spoke like a man taking down a kite, one hand at a time, no sudden. “I cannot make any of this gentler with my words. I do not own that power and the people who pretend they do are salesmen and ministers who have forgotten where their hats are. I can make a promise about papers and listening. I can say the word accident and mean it in the way that does not absolve but invites explanation. I can tell you we will not say your name loud in rooms where your name is not the point.” Abbi watched his mouth like a foreigner who used to know this language and now had to relearn it where it has drifted a syllable to the left. “I cut their hair,” she said, and the room did not shift, though in any righteous story it might have tilted. “I did that because I have a problem with leaving things to do what they want. I wanted to make the changing stop. They were sleeping. The sleeping is my fault.”

There was a time in Lindy’s life when the word fault had a shape like a docket. It lived on paper with indentations and clerks and Always signatures. Hearing it spoken by this small person made the word lose its boring. It turned into a plate too hot to carry. “What did you do to make the sleeping happen?” she asked, and Abbi’s mouth went slack the way a door goes slack when the wind is tired. “It was borrowed,” Abbi said, and it took them a minute to follow. “The place where they keep the wet cold that smells like ghosts. A boy told me once, a long time ago, about the closet with the key that is tied to a spoon. He showed me how the spoon remembers where it is supposed to lie. I didn’t take much. I only wanted the quiet while I did the beautiful thing so the beautiful thing would stay that way and not try to get away. I did not know hearts are sometimes political, the way they decide to stop if you do not ask them in the right order to keep going.” Rook looked at the ceiling to put a leash on his face, the way police learn to make their features into furniture when rooms require it. He said, careful, “You took medicine that was not for you and not to be used that way. You breathed it for them. You made them not know where they were. They did not wake up. Is that the story?” Abbi’s shoulders told them yes before her mouth did.

It would be easy to tilt the room back into the shape of anger, to let the boards creak and the words sharpen. Rook could have stamped something official into the air, and it would have been deserved in the cold ways that deserve is a word we like to keep on a shelf for when we want to stop thinking. Lindy did not ask for kindness from the air. She asked for chronology. She asked how many, and Abbi told them three, and then looked very hard at her own fingers as if her hands had betrayed her by being able to count. She asked how Abbi learned the idea of stillness being the opposite of danger, and Abbi told her in pieces about a winter where a woman had said, “Hold very still,” and then nothing hurt for a minute, and how for years afterward stillness had felt like an exit door. She asked about the flowers and Abbi spoke with genuine bewilderment at how poor a container stems are for intentions. “I thought the word would hold more if there were leaves near it,” she said, and it embarrassed Lindy that this made her throat burn, because the words in her life had been employed to make money and decide fates and she had not often thought to leave a stem under one to make it less lonely.

They had to bring in the papers eventually. The room could not be the only room. A man whose job it was to type and keep his voice neutral came in with a pad and a small machine and the kind of tie that mothers buy their sons when they are trying to make a bet with God. Rook did not leave. He sat sideways so he could see through the window to the squad lot where a storm had been arguing with itself all afternoon and had finally gone sulkily around the corner. He answered the questions he could answer without making a promise about outcomes he could not make. Lindy translated without saying she was translating, turning “intent” into “plan” and “consent” into “did they say you could,” and each time Abbi said no she said it like someone who had not known how much that word weighed when it sits on a thing that has already happened. The typing man wrote neat as prayer and then leaned back to take the ache out of his neck and then leaned forward to be sure his neatness didn’t let a line get crooked.

They did not put Abbi in a cell that night. They put her in a place with a bed that had been made by someone who thought squares are capable of comfort. She lay on top of the blanket and did not close her eyes. The hallway outside did that nighttime animal noise that buildings do when people move in them with their shoes off and try to pretend the floor doesn’t complain. Lindy went home because there are rules about usefulness and because her mother had called twice and then had called her brother and he had texted a promise to keep ducks out of it and then had called her to ask if she was sleeping. She stood in her own kitchen and put her phone face down in the spice drawer as if burying it and then took it out again and held it like a thing that could bless if you said the right words. Respect is an investment, her father had said years ago, and the market had corrected her out of a family. She had been trying to change the index by winning cases against sorrow ever since. She laughed at herself, which felt cruel and correct, then stood too long with her forehead on the cold window until the aching felt like information.

On Sunday she went to the roast because she is stubborn and because the part of her that is a lawyer knows about precedent, and because she had told her mother she would, and if there is any law older than the one in books it is that promises to mothers are sticky and difficult to set aside. Her father wore the apron printed with the joke about meat that had made her groan when she was twelve and made her groan now because fathers do not change in the ways children want them to. He carved with a priestly patience and set aside the crisp edges even though they were his favorite because his wife liked to pretend that rationing was a character, and her affection for that fiction made her nicer for a while. He asked about work as if each word were a dollar he was loaning her to see what she would spend it on. She told him not the names he would want but a parable about a girl who thought she could make time do what she said and how the city had gotten very loud and then very quiet, and he said something about gullibility and modernity and then said he was tired of hearing about criminals with soft stories.

“You don’t like it when I make the world romantic,” he said, and he cut the fat from his slice as if demonstrating the cutting from of things. “But you love to make them poetry when it benefits you.” Lindy put her napkin in her lap as if settling a dove and told him she had no poetry for what had happened, only the cold arithmetic that three men were dead and a girl had brought herself to a place with locked doors when she could have run. Her mother watched the exchange with the look of a woman who can see a future with too many meals like this in it and cannot convince anyone to use different salt. “I don’t want you to go soft,” her mother said finally, as if she were apologizing to the meat. “But I don’t want you to get so hard you start sounding like a judge with cataracts either. There is more than one way to keep a person from drowning. Sometimes you throw them a rope and sometimes you sit on the dock and tell them about the shallows until they find them.”

The town did not know about the rope yet. The town knew whispers and the beautiful sensation of thinking you have held a story before it was domesticated. At the market an older woman with a purse that had scuffed corners said to a friend that she had always thought the doctors in this place behaved as if they were the only people who knew how to say No, and perhaps a little symmetry had come calling. A man in a baseball cap said it was a shame but not unforgivable and then said it was absolutely unforgivable and did not notice that contradiction was sitting on his plate, waiting to be eaten. The hospital put out a statement with words in it like tragedy and resolve and accountability, and every time the word accountability shows up on a page like that, it does not sit where it is put; it buzzes and tries to find a home in someone’s ear and either cannot or does and then makes sleep difficult. A small hill of votive candles marched itself up the sidewalk in front of the clinic on Ogden, though there was a sign that said No Open Flames and a security guard who had given up telling anyone anything that did not directly involve where a car can and cannot be.

Rook had a conversation with a man in a suit colder than his body. The man wanted tidy. He wanted “perpetrator” and “motive” and “chain of custody,” and he got some of those, and Rook gave them to him with the competence of a man who has learned to put handles on things he must carry a long way. But when the man in the suit asked for something that could be brought to a podium to keep the hungry quiet, Rook shrugged and said the hungry never quiet, they sleep only to dream of being hungrier. He used the word vulnerability to a person who does not consider that a trait worth attaching to the word police, and the man’s mouth made a shape it made in rooms with glass and golf. Lindy, later, made fun of the mouth with an unkind accuracy that made Rook laugh longer than the joke deserved, which is a way of keeping a friend. They spoke of next rooms and what paperwork would demand and whether they could force a human moment into the procedural steps without breaking the steps entirely. They spoke of families. They spoke, eventual as night, of Lizzie and of the young resident’s mother who had cried without noise into a handkerchief fragile as mothwing until the corners were salt-stiff.

When Lizzie came, her ring stayed on, whether through decision or inattention, and she sat in the chair that was frankly poor and looked at Abbi the way someone looks at a weather report that says what you already knew but needed a stranger to say. The rules are careful here. A face-to-face is a mess you do not enter without a broom of trained people around you, and even then the dirt is ideological. But the superintendent had a daughter who had once, in her loud months, stolen a locket from a department store and cried on the sidewalk until a woman with commas in her hair told her about shame and kept both of them from being ridiculous. He had his soft, is what we are saying. He listened to Rook say the word restorative and did not flinch and listened to Lindy say the word harm not injury and let the lawyers inside him nap. They put the two women in a small, formal room with two supervisors who had eyes like old coins and a therapist who had mended a lot of situations that were really little more than an apology waiting for a noun.

Abbi did not start and Lizzie did not start and the therapist was about to do the gentle push that is his art when Lizzie did something that even she would not have expected herself to do; she asked Abbi if she had brushed his hair. The question was so steeped in domesticity that it made the composition of the air change. Abbi said yes and her mouth tried to become a smile to make the yes survivable and then failed and became a wound. Lizzie said he had hated it when she did it and loved it when someone else did, and they both sat with that truth like a stone in a shoe. Then Lizzie said the word forgive and did not attach it to a subject, which is a dangerous way to deploy a verb. She said she wanted to find the fact inside it that did not feel like betrayal of the dead or of herself, and she said she was lost. Abbi did not give her a road. She said she could tell her that his scalp had been warm for a little while and she had felt it and had not understood until later that the warmth was the last of him making itself into air, and Lizzie put her hand to her own head and made a sound that made the therapist remember a night on call when there had been too many deliveries and not enough hands.

Lindy watched and did not cry and did not take notes. She watched because watching is work when other people cannot and because the shape of this moment would be the one she would carry back when she had to talk to a room full of people who wanted the numbers and the law. She would say there was something like grace and something like ash and that we cannot live without either, and the room would hate her for it and then need her tomorrow when it had to do the same arithmetic and call it policy. She thought, for a shameful half-second, of telling her father about this precise exchange, just to see if something in his face would crack the way a lake cracks in spring and reveals it had been a river all along. Then she pictured the set of his jaw when he said “criminals with soft stories” and she set that wish away like a dish you only bring down when there are guests who will appreciate it.

The trial would come. Trials are thick with choreography, and everyone pretends it is just walking until they get to the complicated step and everyone’s feet feel too big. Lindy would not be a part of the formal show. Her use in this had been to walk in front of the parade and clear the children from the street before the floats arrived, a job that makes nobody cheer and is secretly all anyone remembers when no one dies. She would go back to her alphabet of wills and the yellow pad and the pens that made the quiet scratching that reminded her how to inhale without instruction. Yet the days had been rearranged inside her, and she could feel her own organizing system arguing with the new boxes. When she met Rook for coffee in a place with tables too small for all the lives that got lived at them, he told her about a dream where hair grew out of the ground like meadowgrass and a hundred children braided it into ropes and climbed into a ceiling that did not exist until they demanded it. She told him about a dream with no sound where she opened all her umbrellas and they were all canvases from different paintings and none of them knew how to keep off rain but all of them knew how to keep her company.

Abbi slept sometimes in the interim before custody changed her weather. She slept in tiny bursts the way city birds do in artificial light, a practice of safety that never satisfied. She woke and washed her hands and stood at the window that showed her a rectangle of field with a single tree, and she studied the tree with the attention she had used to learn which floorboards in a church make sound and which let you glide. Trees keep secrets about staying alive in one place that people want and do not often get. She did not think of herself as waiting for punishment. She thought of herself as waiting to be told what name the world would use for her, because names do not just stick, they steer, and she had been living in the ditch between two. When a nurse came to take her to the room where the man with the tie and the neat papers would tell her what next would look like, the nurse did not touch her, and Abbi thought that was both correct and hard, and she put one foot in front of the other and did not count.

Margarita kept working at the clinic because the rent does not wait, and because if she stopped washing her hands, she feared they would stop being hers. She had chosen a new scrub top with daffodils that made her look like a promise no one knows how to keep, and every time she put it on she decided to mean hope and then forgave herself when she meant only get through. She had told her mother she had been in the room, and her mother had prayed in the old language and said the word evil like it was a rope she was trying to throw out a window and had a bad arm. Margarita stood at the desk and sorted forms and looked up when boomers called Vitamin C "C" as if the alphabet were a menu. When she learned, in a quiet voice over the counter, that the goblin had been a girl who stopped being a goblin the instant she said a name out loud to the right person, she nodded and did not share that she had already known that from the moment she smelled leaves.

One evening, walking past the bridge on her way to a house call she had no business making and did anyway because there are some visits you schedule with your ghosts, Lindy found the comb. It lay in the silt like a discarded rib, a little proud of its broken teeth. She picked it up and turned it in her hand and thought of a small hand making a decision over and over about direction, and she did not pocket it because the river, even a fake river, deserves its relics. She placed it on the lip of the culvert as if there were a small altar there anyone else had ever recognized. It looked both tawdry and holy, the way all talismans do when you know the story behind them and wish you didn’t. She stood until the mosquitoes remembered she was meat and then she let them have a little, because sometimes you pay the toll to feel like a creature among other creatures, and then she drove home with the windows down to give the night a chance to argue her into softness.

On a Wednesday that did not know it was anything but a Wednesday, the judge assigned to the new world walked in with the kind of beard men grow when they retire and then don’t, and the prosecutor’s shoes made their unmusical clack. Words like involuntary and negligence and intent moved around wearing uniforms they had not been meant to wear in this particular parade. Lindy sat on a bench in the back and watched with the appetite of someone who loves the machine and hates what it does to anything tender that enters it. She watched Abbi answer questions and she watched the faces of the gallery when they learned about the spoon tied to the key and the cold closet and the way adoration can be violent when it does not know what it is. She watched Lizzie hold her own hands together and not look. She watched Rook look only when he knew it mattered that someone with his badge be seen looking and then look down when it mattered that someone with his badge make it clear that looking was not the only verb he knew.

Later, on the courthouse steps where pigeons have learned to operate at least four human sadnesses without getting fat, a reporter tried to get Lindy to say something that could be broken into twelve seconds and put between weather and sports. She said no three times and practiced the art of moving sideways while staying still. The reporter asked her if this made her think differently about doctors and she said it made her think the same about everyone, which is that we are terrifying when we love badly and unbearable when we do not love at all. The camera sneezed light at her and she made the face she makes when rain comes in through an open window and hits the wood floor. Rook, standing close enough to be mistaken for a ghost with an attitude, said he would take the microphone if the young man needed to interview the void. They walked to the corner and stopped where the shade made their eyes private and they watched two teenagers eat french fries like prayers and talk too fast. “What would you have done, if she had run,” Rook asked, the question not theoretical but a mapping exercise. “I would have come back to the bridge,” Lindy said. “I would have sat. I would have left the thermos and then I would have left myself.”

There is an argument to be made that nothing ends, not properly, not even badly. There is an argument to be made that we have to pretend endings exist or we would never go to sleep. Months later, in a garden her mother had overplanted like a woman trying to be forgiven by the food, Lindy stood and cut basil into a bowl and her father came out with a beer and said nothing. He said nothing for five minutes and then he said he had been wrong about a thing he hadn’t specified, and she almost missed it because he had disguised the confession as weather. She did not make him say which thing. She did not need the charity of that detail. She told him about a duck that had burped at the right moment, and he laughed the old laugh, the one that had raised her eyebrow into mischief when she was small and had taught her that a house can be a home if the sounds are right. She took the basil inside and the kitchen smelled like the color green and her mother said something about salt and she said, out of the blue as if someone had left the sentence on her tongue and she had been waiting for the right mouth to pass, “I am not going to stop helping people when the rules say no.” Her mother handed her the spoon and said, “Please don’t. Just don’t forget where you live.”

Under the bridge, which was not anyone’s home but had done very good work as a chapel, the comb was gone. Someone had needed it, or the water had decided to reclaim all broken versions of order. The graffiti had acquired a new layer, a single word that had been written in a hand that preferred circles to angles. It did not say love or stay or any one of the blunt instructions that had traveled the town like cousins at a funeral. It said breathe, and the e’s were fat as beans. The ducks ignored it because birds have no use for neon directives, but people passing on their way to other people read it, and some of them, quietly, did what the wall said and found, to their irritation or relief, that their bodies had been waiting all day for someone to give them permission. Above, on Washington, a train went by with the polite thunder it had practiced for a century, and those on the platform did the choreography of strangers and took a step back together because that is a way of being safe that doesn’t bother anyone. In a house with a lilac that had learned the art of throwing its scent over the fence into the neighbors’ envy, Lindy put her umbrellas in the hall closet and thought, irrelevantly and correctly, that she would never get them to behave, and also that the point had never been dryness.In the weeks that followed, the trees began to consider turning, and the town’s appetite for certainty mellowed into the kind of appetite you bring to soup. Hair, stubborn as always, asserted its thesis on a thousand heads and wrists and chins. Men stood in the fogged mirrors of the barbershops and made their same small negotiations with themselves, and women tied their hair back in the grocery store and felt, without admitting it, the intimacy of that gesture with mortality’s arguments. There was talk, soft and defiant, of donation drives; girls in church basements braided one another’s courage and let scissors make their serious snips, and the sweepings were gathered with tenderness as if sweeping were at last the esteemable vocation it had always wanted to be. The doctors whose names had become a shorthand in town were now recipes, too—someone would begin to tell a story about pain and then say Weller and the friend would nod and cut a slice of something simple because some nouns make more sense if you give them starch.

Lindy returned to the alphabet because the alphabet returned to her. The wills on her desk were patient in the way paper is patient, and she found in their gentle tyranny a relief that startled her. More people came than usual with the forms clutched like talismans, polite as supplicants, and she sat with them and let them tell her about their children’s competence and their spouses’ kindness and their own minor sins, which have a way of elbowing into the place where legality is supposed to sit. An older man with hands that trembled only when he pronounced the name of a particular parrot asked to change his medical proxy from a son who lived in Sacramento to a neighbor who did not make promises he could not keep, and she drafted the paper and thought, not for the first time, that dignity really does fit better when the tailoring is local. She found herself giving people ten unreadable minutes in which their throats loosened and something like acceptance crawled out and sat between them on the desk like a cat that has decided, temporarily, to be domestic. Her half sandwiches acquired a ritual companionship; she found herself saving the better half for later as if anticipating a visitor and then smiling when the visitor turned out to be her own patience arriving late to the appointment.

Rook, who had long ago learned that wearing a badge inflicts upon you certain ceremonial duties, went to a middle school to talk about rumors because the principal had asked and because the last time he had said no to a principal he had been nine and it had ended with a phone call to his aunt and his aunt’s careful silence. He brought no props and no PowerPoint and stood in front of a sea of knees and sneakers and said, “Names are not toys,” and watched how three boys in the third row tried hard to look like chairs. He told them that sometimes the only difference between a story and a weapon is whether you sharpen it, and a girl with blue barrettes nodded so fiercely he worried she might injure her own spine. After, the boy from the gas station with the cartoon-shark shuffle sought him out and asked a question that was not a question, which was whether monsters ever say sorry. Rook said sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t know how to assign the verb to themselves, and sometimes it is not monsters at all, just people whose fear is speaking louder than their actual voices, and then he asked the boy if he played chess, and when the boy said he did not, Rook said, “If you ever decide to learn, I have a board with a rook that’s been dropped so many times it refuses to be dignified and still does the job.” The boy smiled at that because the idea of a useful chip is an idea a certain kind of child is born ready to trust.

Abbi found herself in rooms where the walls had learned the habits of listening. The woman she spoke to in one such room introduced herself as Dr. Saito and made no immediate claims on the moment. She had a watch with a black face and a strap that was frank about having been repaired by someone who believed in endurance, and she asked questions that made room for answers that did not know their own names yet. They spoke about ice in a way that made it clear they were not actually speaking about ice, and about the concept of getting to keep a thing by not touching it and why that can be as dangerous as the clutching kind of keeping. Abbi told her about the spoon and the key and how some doors, when you open them, make you feel like a god for a second and then take it back, and Dr. Saito nodded as if gods are always boorish. They circled the word responsibility until it stopped behaving like a police dog and lay down on its side; Abbi put a tentative hand on its flank and felt the ribs and did not pull away, and Dr. Saito did not smile because the moment was too much like a truth to survive embellishment.

Lizzie’s grief acquired housekeeping. She went to Weller’s office with a cardboard box and a patience that frightened her in its competence. There was a photo of a river taken at an angle that made the river look as if it had gotten lost and asked to be a path for a while, and she put it in the box because her house had an empty nail, and the nail had a larger gravity than the photo’s subject. She found a single hair on the calendar in June—a small curl, surprised to be there, as if hair could mistake itself for pencil—and she did not put it in the box; she lifted the calendar and dropped both into the trash in the hallway with such deliberation that the act’s seeming smallness became tragic. When she learned there was a hair donation drive named for him, she wrote the kind of letter that sounds kind and asks a favor. She asked them not to put his name on hats. She asked them to let the girls keep their own names on their own heads and did not feel, when she mailed it, like she had betrayed anything besides the portion of the town that needed rituals to be tangible in order to count. The letter came back with a heart drawn in blue pen on the envelope and a note that said of course, and she laughed at the absurd grace of blue pen hearts.

When Lindy and Rook visited Abbi together, the air in the corridor seemed to have removed its shoes. They did not sit across from her as if playing an adversarial game; they sat as if sharing a bench that had learned to be patient with a hundred tired hips. The state’s attorney had a voice like tin that day and was talking about degrees and intentions and about the requirements of a populace that likes its words to punish as well as describe. Lindy translated the law in the way you translate for a visitor who is not lost so much as convinced the map is a sheet of rain. She told Abbi what second means and what manslaughter means and what happens when a court decides your mind was not where the rulebook wanted it at the time your hands did what they did. Rook spoke not at all for a while and then said, “We will try to find a room that has windows, not just mirrors,” and Abbi flinched at the word try because try is a word that has broken its promises before. Lindy did not correct him because to make a team you have to let hope misbehave a little, and because even in war they give soldiers songs.

On a Sunday, because the calendar continues to insist, Lindy went to the house where roast had made its deal with the air, and her mother met her at the door with a dishrag that had opinions. Her father had located his old toolbox and the umbrella with the bent brass and had decided to exact from them both the kind of apology older men prefer: the apology of function restored. He softened the metal with a gentleness that would have made taffy proud, and he did not look at her while he did it, and she did not make the mistake of asking him questions in a tone that would have made both the umbrella and the moment too self-aware. They ate quietly, which in that house is the opposite of a failure, and when he told her to bring the mended thing outside into the small, indifferent rain, she did, and it did not entirely behave, but it behaved better. He stood next to her and let the rain spray his arm and said nothing about criminals and poetry and said instead something about zucchini getting uppity in the garden. She loved him, for a slice of a second, as if nothing in the world had ever been complicated or legal.

At the hospital, the policy about keys changed with the performative zeal of bureaucracy. The spoon became a fob and the closet became a room that apologized for itself with an alarm that sounded like a duck being counseled, and a laminated matrix appeared on two bulletin boards explaining in Helvetica who could touch which door. Margarita read the matrix twice and then read the faces of the nurses who pretended to read the matrix and actually memorized one another’s phone extensions because that is how the world keeps moving. She put a hand on the shoulder of a woman whose father had smelled like smoke since 1983 and said, “I will ask the doctor to come to you now,” and the woman closed her eyes in the manner of believers and said, “Bless you,” and Margarita did not mind the misattribution because blessings, like cookies, are better when distributed liberally. She sometimes thought about hair while she washed her hands and then gave herself a small lecture on the virtue of letting the mind be stupid wherever it finds its relief.

The library decided to host a reading group about monsters who turn out not to be monsters, which is a popular genre when people are looking for excuses and a brave one when they are looking for others. Lindy sat in the back because sitting in the back is a habit that stays with you when you make a living facing rooms, and she listened to a retired teacher read a passage about a girl whose hands knew more than her mouth was allowed to say. A teenager whose ear cartilage had made its peace with studs said that the scariest thing about the story was the adults who talk like, “He’ll get over it,” and the room hummed in agreement the way rooms do when someone says a truth and everyone wants credit for it. After, a kid with chipped nail polish that had become a map of countries no one can visit told Lindy she had seen Abbi once under the bridge and had not been scared, exactly, just felt like the world was a little closer than usual, and Lindy said that feeling is what happens when the stories we’ve been told are finally outnumbered, and the kid nodded like a person who has just found the right word on a shelf that had been empty for years.

Abbi’s hair, over those weeks, did the only thing it knows how to do. It reached, shyly at first, like a child offering an object it finds precious and expects to be mocked for loving. A woman came on Tuesdays with a rolling case and the philosophy that scissors are only trustworthy when they’re made to feel at home. She asked permission and then asked again for the permission inside the first permission, and when Abbi said yes, she combed with the kind of attention that makes the person beneath the comb realize their scalp is a place and not just a border. The sound of the teeth moving through the short growth was like a pencil making a list. Abbi closed her eyes and felt, with an honesty that made her dizzy, the difference between shaving and tending, and she did not cry because her body had other things it needed to do with its water just then. In the therapy garden she put two fingers into soil that had forgotten at last the feel of salt and poked two bean seeds into a shallow depression. Dr. Saito said beans are fat and cocky and will make her feel like a god, and that there are worse things to practice, and Abbi smiled without her mouth getting wounded.

Rook’s name once again found its silly alignment with his pastime. In a church basement with the hum of a soda machine performing its only trick, he played a game against a boy who had learned the knight before learning to write legibly. It was not the boy from the gas station; it was someone else’s child who had decided that the board was a democracy and would be governed accordingly. Rook lost because he was explaining a thing when he should have been protecting a thing, and he did not resent the lesson because losing to a child is one of the few mercies adulthood offers that does not come with a stick. On his way home he parked and walked the long loop that takes you beneath the railroad where the word breathe had made its temporary temple. He touched the wall with two fingers as if testing whether the paint had cured, and he thought of all the words he had not said in rooms where it might have done some good and of the ones he had put aside because a room is a beast you feed with silences and the trick is knowing which ones to throw and which to keep.

Stories breed regardless of their nutrition. Someone left a small pile of hair on the steps of the clinic that was not hair at all but thread, and someone took a picture and then someone else swore they had seen an apparition, and Rook sighed so…mildly, because this, too, is the work, and he called the boy at the gas station by his name and asked him to put his mimicry to better use. For a week it seemed like there might be a second person who thinks scissors and love are synonyms, and then it turned out to be adolescence with access to a craft drawer, and the town exhaled in relief and then looked around to see whether the exhale had offended anyone. Lindy wrote a small piece for the town paper about not making altars of our worst moments, and two men sent letters to the editor calling her naive and then came and asked her quietly to look over their advance directives, because we are all, in the end, practical.

When the day came to put words into the mouth of the machine and make it render something that could be called justice without making the roof buckle, the judge wore a tie that had clearly been a gift and only once tugged at his beard in a way that would later read as insensitive if anyone had been filming. Abbi did not lift her chin or lower it in any dramatic fashion; she found the angle that seems least like a performance and held her head there, and the bravery of that is a subtle bravery that most narratives consider uncinematic and therefore undervalue. The language was what it always is: old words pretending not to be tired. Involuntary. Reckless. Negligent. Diminished. The prosecutors did their choreography without falling and the defenders did theirs while looking for handholds on a wall that had never featured them. Lizzie read a statement in which she spoke not as a wife or ex-wife or widow, but as a person who had once shared toothpaste with a man, and the judge, to his credit, let the toothpaste be the theology it is. Margarita spoke in the voice that should be piped into every courtroom where words begin to forget their topics. She said kindness is exhausting when it is correct, and she said that she had not been assigned the job of naming anything, and she did not intend to start, and the gallery made that small respectful rumble that is the only honest applause courts know.

The result, which the papers tried to compress into a noun, refused compression. The state’s attorney, either in a moment of genuine humility or in a bid to cut losses that had begun to look like a campaign, agreed that the appropriate road included hospitals not cages. There would be a term that had a beginning and a middle and a thing like a door at the end, but inside it there would be rooms with windows and mandatory conversations and the requirement that Abbi make a thing that is not an apology into a structure she could inhabit. The judge spoke a bit about currents and about the quality of intent when it is mistaken for mercy, and Lindy felt a brief, foolish fondness for him as he wrestled the hydra of nuance in a place built for bluntness. After, outside, a woman with a microphone that held its own breath too close asked Lindy if the community should be relieved, and Lindy said the community should not be anything on command, and the microphone did not know what to do with that and so handed the air to the weatherman.

In the grocery store line a fortnight later, Lindy watched the woman ahead of her consider whether to put back the good olives and buy the cheap ones and then not put them back, and she loved that small rebellion more than anything the town had said in its official capacity. Her umbrellas, when she thought of them now, seemed less like a joke she could not stop telling and more like an honest admission that sometimes you do what you can to make a movable roof, and if it leaks a little you pretend your hair is a calendar and this is a day marked with rain. She took them in for mending again because it pleased her father to force metal back into manners, and when she left he gave her a jar of pickles so green they looked like an argument with winter and said, without looking directly at her, “You did not embarrass us,” and she laughed, foolishly, because that was what passed here for a benediction.

Abbi wrote a letter to no one and handed it to Dr. Saito, who put it in a folder that did not claim to be a shrine. The letter said, in a plain that was not simple, that she had decided to practice the art of allowing and that it was every bit as violent, inside the body, as stealing, and that she understood now why the world has to be a place where beans grow and scissors are kept in drawers with instructions. She said she would like to learn the names of the birds that make small, rude noises under bridges and that she would like, if it is allowed, to be permitted to comb someone else’s hair only when they ask, and Dr. Saito said she would make a note, because the law, for all its hubris, can be taught manners. The beans did as promised and sprouted, brazen and efficient, and Abbi looked at their certainty with a hunger that felt less like limp longing and more like the beginning of a trade.

Rook stood one evening with his aunt on a porch that had endured three generations of paint choices and listened to her talk about her knees. She told him in her brisk way that old bodies are honest in a manner that young ones should study, and he told her, in his way that sounds like a man moving carefully through a room he respects, that he had watched a girl say yes to the truth in a room that had never meant to be merciful. His aunt clicked her tongue and said mercy is not in rooms, it is in people you let next to you, and he thought of Lindy and the way she sits like a woman trained in stillness and spends it like a charitable organization. He told his aunt about the word breathe and she said, “About time,” and he loved her in the particular way you love someone who can annotate your awe without diminishing it.

In the culvert’s acoustics the frogs resumed their committee meetings as if no human had ever stood there praying under other names. The graffiti paled and then was refreshed by a hand that loved circles more than angles and possibly worked nights at the diner where coffee refuses defeat. Winter would come again and with it the particular etiquette of cold, and in the rooms where plans are made someone would say the phrase lessons learned and carry it around like a cinderblock and set it down in the corner and forget it for months. In the courts a new case would arrive, one with less poetry in it and more money, and Lindy, with her yellow pad and calm, would translate again for someone who does not like maps. Lizzie would keep the calendar with the hair and then, one too-bright Saturday, throw it away with an economy that made her own muscles blink, and Margarita would find herself humming a tune that is perhaps only the sound of a tap acquiescing to a request.

The umbrellas did not become reliable. They became companions. In a rain that had not been forecast because the sky had decided to be impudent, Lindy stood under one that listed to the right and decided that the sound water makes hitting fabric is a kind of applause you can accept without having to be good on a stage. She turned so the spray would hit her face because staying dry had ceased to be the point and looked, without meaning to, at her reflection in a window that refused to be a mirror and thought, not unkindly, that hair grows whether or not we look. Somewhere a train made its promise and kept it, and out in the bean bed a small green violence pressed against the dirt and made the dirt surrender, which is not the same as losing and is perhaps the only reliable ending we get.The night the transformers on Washington Street hiccuped and threw half the town into romantic darkness, Lindy was at her desk making a list of things that did not belong to her and that she nevertheless carried. She had reached the blank line after fathers when the room dropped into shadow and the radio under the bookshelf clicked to quiet with a small consenting sigh. Outside, a fizz of blue pulsed and went, and then the street acquired the hush cities pretend to give up only on purpose. She rose and let her hands find the drawer where the candles were kept that she pretended not to need because preparedness felt like an apology in advance. The match struck and the room rearranged itself around a coin of light that made familiar objects perform new tricks with their shadows. She thought of Abbi under an institutional ceiling and of the way darkness in public buildings is an act of betrayal more than an absence, and she put the candle back in its cup because there is a kind of leaving that looks like staying when you do not blow the flame out. The street sounded like a backstage, all shuffling and throat-clearing and restraint.

Rook was three blocks away directing traffic that did not want to be directed and doing it with the patience that is not performative but learned at tables with men who threw cards and mean words and expected him to take both. He stood in the spill of a corner store’s emergency lights, and his hands made the old shapes that tell drivers that you are as much a fact as a stop sign. Every fourth person rolled their window down and asked if it would be long, as if time were a roadblock that could be moved with persuasion, and he said something true and soothing about crews and estimates and the way light likes to make a scene when it leaves. A boy on a bicycle hovered without committing to the crosswalk, and Rook leaned just enough to make his shoulder into a welcoming geography and the boy slid by like a fish deciding to live. In the brief gaps, he thought of the word breathe flaking under the rail bridge and of the hands that had circled those letters to make them fat on purpose, as if trust could be made visible by excess.

The facility where Abbi slept and counted ceiling tiles mistakenly thought itself prepared for the dark. Lights threaded to a generator came up in slender rows as if a garden had been planted upside down, and the hallways acquired a submarine quality that made steps sound deliberate. In her room, the small rectangle of field went from gray to a deeper gray that argued for the existence of color rather than displaying it, and she sat up to let her body tell her that the dark wasn’t the old dark but a new kind that could be named. Dr. Saito came with a flashlight held low because she believed in not aiming beams at faces, and she said the predictable sentence about outages and restoration and then took the chair that had always felt slightly too cheerful for the room and turned it so they were both looking at the window. “It’s nothing,” Abbi said, which in her mouth meant everything, and Dr. Saito nodded because sometimes the job is to be a chorus that does not overwhelm the soloist. “When the lights go,” Abbi said, “the cars are louder, like they want to be brave,” and Dr. Saito said that bravery looks egotistical when you’re tired, and they both watched the shadow of the tree try on a different body for a while.

Margarita walked the long hallway of the clinic with the calm that comes from accepting that electricity will betray you more politely if you are nice to it. The machines blinked their complaint messages over and over like stubborn children, and she touched each with the same reprimand and apology and made notes with a pen that had a heart on its clip. The waiting room, with its fish that had ceased their shimmering on the screen, felt newly honest in its lack of simulation, and the candy dish gleamed like a planet with its own weather. She checked the break room twice and laid a hand on the electric kettle as if to let it know it had not been forgotten in the census of things that make morning bearable. Out by the front door, someone had taped a hand-lettered sign announcing the closure with a marker that liked to feather at the edges; unintentionally, the word sorry looked like it had tried to grow leaves. She locked the door and stood for a minute with her forehead against the cool glass, because sometimes letting the materials stop your heat is how you remember that you have a border.

The outage made Lizzie’s house an arrangement of memory pieces: the shadows her husband’s shirts used to make on a line in summer, the glow of a nightlight that had gone from savage protector to burned-out sentinel, the ritual of finding candles in the drawer that used to hold placemats. She moved carefully, not in fear but in the practiced manner of someone who has learned that a jar of cumin can shatter and change a day’s story. When she found the lighter in the bowl where keys and pennies get to be a family for a while, she paused, thinking of a respiration that had not continued and of the way light flatters us into thinking time is a thing we groom. The flame touched the wick and the wick did the humble chemistry, and the room’s angles softened in gratitude. She took down the photo of the river and put it on the table near the candle, less as an altar than as a small experiment in companionship. The picture did not behave differently, of course, but it was easier to think kindly of water when fire was making a case for it.

The morning after, the town wore the hangover of people who had learned they are not in charge of their own switches. Businesses opened late and made jokes, which is how commerce forgives itself for existing. There were lines at the coffee places that had mastered the art of “just a sec,” and at the hardware store a customer held an entire conversation with a clerk using the vocabulary of batteries. Lindy walked through it with a feeling she was embarrassed to name: she liked the way people looked at one another when their machines had failed and their bodies had to go back to doing the old work of making eye contact. She stopped to buy a bag of ice for no particular reason other than its part in yesterday’s small drama, and at the counter a woman with a scarf tied so decisively it made other people’s necks stand up a bit straighter said that her freezer had given up and, with it, her daughters’ popsicles, and now both children were practicing grief in the living room. “Good,” Lindy said, meaning it, and the woman laughed in the polite, grateful way that says I think you might be on my team.

In the program notes of Abbi’s new world, Dr. Saito added one line she did not often write as plainly as that: “Allow for an encounter with harmless risk.” To do it, she made a phone call to a woman named Ava who ran a wig bank out of a room behind the oncology clinic with a devotion usually reserved for rescue dogs. Ava had hands that could find the root of a knot without shaming it, and she kept three small stools for children and a music speaker that played only songs in which someone forgives someone by accident. “We do not do field trips as policy,” the administrator said, and Dr. Saito, who liked rules in theory and exceptions in practice, said that policy is a name we give to fear when we need an adult voice for it. They made a plan that had more signatures than a prom yearbook and a route that avoided the corners where the town kept its habit of being curious. The day they went, the clouds had made a cover that made everyone pretend they were in on a secret. Abbi wore a sweatshirt whose cuffs had become their own private islands and walked between Dr. Saito and a woman with a clipboard whose job was to be mistaken for a friend.

The wig room was smaller than its subject deserved and contained hair like a library contains everything it has. Some on stands, some in baskets, some braided like promises waiting for their turn to be believed. Ava showed Abbi how to hold the fiber like breath, and she did it with an assumption of competence that startled Abbi into enjoyment. They combed the same piece forward and then back, and the sound of it was very close to the sound beans make when you move soil off their shoulders to see how their ambition is coming along. Abbi did not cry because she had already used her water in the other room when she signed the paper that said she would not take anything, even a fallen strand, away with her. “Do you see how there’s a change in texture closest to where a head was,” Ava said, and Abbi nodded because the intimacy of that knowledge felt like a friend turning her palm up and finding yours there. For an hour they held tools that in other rooms would have been forbidden and here were the implements of help, and the world did not break, and when they left the hall’s fluorescent light felt less like a threat and more like a sad aunt trying to be kind.

Rook, long practiced in the double-lunch that paperwork demands, found himself eating his sandwich on a bench that had collected the wrappers of teenagers like a small nest. The bench faced the river as it compactly moved toward no ocean in particular, and a volunteer in a bright vest leaned on a grabber and tried to coax a plastic bottle out of a bramble without committing to thornhood. Rook finished the last bite and felt the bread’s apology to his teeth and had the thought he had never said aloud, that police work when you do it awhile is less about catching than about the choreography of not making things worse. He had a hearing later about a kid who had helped himself to the cash register at his aunt’s nail salon and then sat on the curb to wait because consequences, in his mind, had become a fetching dog. The aunt had cried in the peculiar rhythm of people who are angry with themselves for having loved someone insufficiently to predict their error. He would stand in a room where the ceiling tiles had seen too much and he would say something about mercy’s ratio to lesson, and he would feel like a man tasked with the distribution of rain.

Invitations found Lindy now in a way they hadn’t before, too large, too late, too earnest, and written in the language of committees. The one from the hospital had the word forum in it twice, which set her teeth a little on edge, but the panel was titled Listening After, and even if the title made her sigh, the after was a place she had been living in most of her adult life. They assembled in an auditorium that made phlegm noises when air moved through its balcony ducts, and the water pitchers sweated dramatically. Onstage with her were a pastor with a gift for unweaponized authority, a nurse who had the look of people who have counted pills for endurance and found a way to keep one for themselves, and a woman introduced as a “community liaison” whose blank smile made everyone in the first three rows feel briefly unmoored. Lindy spoke of the difference between curiosity and care, and of the way the former wants details like souvenirs while the latter learns to do without objects entirely. She told a version of the story that did not make Abbi the point and did not make the doctors the symbols, and a man at the back raised his hand and asked if there would be a time when he could stop feeling angry. “Of course,” she said before the pastor could perform an answer, “because anger gets tired faster than grief does, and eventually you will need your arms for other things.” The man laughed and then, abruptly and with no theater, did not.

At home, her father’s voice had acquired a new habit of stopping at the doorframe of a thought and knocking before coming in. He did not bring her turns of phrase to argue with like he used to; he brought her tomatoes with a note on lined paper about which days they had been watered, and the note had the parenthetical about afternoon sun like a person learning how to annotate love. The umbrella he had bent into obedience lived by her door like a tired dog, and sometimes she opened it in the hallway city of her apartment and let it make her taller and under, and she laughed every time because to be inside your own weather is not a small joke. At the stove she burned the first pancake of the batch and threw it away because there is no use pretending rituals do not have their waste, and she sent a picture of the second to her brother who replied with a duck that had somehow learned to wear a crown made of peas. She stood barefoot and ate and thought of the heatless quiet that had visited and left and decided that she might always, even in romance, prefer the truth of a room when you can hear the compressor kick back in.

A letter arrived with no return address and the kind of stamp older people keep for emergencies, and inside was a piece of heavy paper folded with indecision and a short message written in ink that had blotched where a hand had hesitated. “My husband,” it began, and Lindy sank into a chair as if the words themselves had weight and she had agreed to carry them. The writer told her that she had not been able to look at anyone who wore their hair in any way at all without feeling a little sick, and then she had seen a girl in the grocery store with the bravest little stubble and it had been like watching a house whose porch light had come on after a storm. “I do not forgive with any skill,” the letter said in a line Lindy wished she could copy down for future storms, “but I am practicing not letting the shape of my husband’s absence turn everyone else into a lamp with a shade I hate.” She folded it back into itself and put it in the drawer with the napkins because dignity is not always solemn.

In the garden at the facility, Abbi’s beans committed themselves to the ancient arrogance of growing, and a small cohort of other patients gathered around them as if the leaves were reciting. Dr. Saito took this for the victory it was and did not make it too large in her notes. When it rained, they set a shallow pan beneath the downspout and watched the water collect with the attention we usually reserve for screens, and someone said that maybe water is the first screen and we’ve misunderstood our history of boredom. Abbi said that she liked the smell that happens right when rain starts like a friend who arrives early, and the woman next to her said she did not have many friends and Abbi did not either but they both knew the names of geese, which is a form of inheritance. After, an orderly with a voice that could have made almost anyone brush their teeth offered to bring out the clippers for the man who liked to make a neat of himself every nine days, and Abbi asked if she could assist, and the orderly said yes, not as a reward but because saying no here turns into a habit too quickly. They folded a towel around his shoulders with a precision that would have made a seamstress nod and did the careful, near-religious dance of keeping the ear safe. Hair fell in small arrangements on the floor like punctuation that had finally agreed to be literal.

The rehabilitation of a town is not a thing you can sell tickets to, but if you could you would find yourself bored at first and then unexpectedly moved by the tiny concessions and annoyances that prove people are truly doing it. A woman who had made it her job to glare at teenagers in the park let one finish his cigarette before asking him to move, and then she brought him a trash bag because sometimes posture is better than principle at getting a person to change their mind. A man who had been loud on the internet about monsters and policing stood in line to donate blood and fainted in the lobby and allowed himself to stay on the floor until the nurse said it was time to pretend it hadn’t happened. The pastor who does not weaponize his authority sat in the back of a movie theater and watched something with car chases and did not write a sermon about it because fun is pious in its own way.

Lindy took a case that she had declined twice because the woman requesting help had the air of someone who wanted free absolution masquerading as legal service. It was about earrings again, and a ledger, and a Tuesday that had turned into a Wednesday with arguments. She went to the nursing home whose carpet confessed to too many choices and asked the manager to show her the chain of custody for the small things, and the manager took the opportunity to talk instead about the big things, which is a way of delaying that has served institutions for centuries. She insisted until the small box appeared with its labeled envelopes that had once contained watches and rings and the folded answers to quarrels, and she found the blank where the earrings ought to have been and watched the manager’s face try to resurrect the old story that residents love to give away their treasures to anyone with a clean smile. “They do,” she said calmly, “but they also love to be asked to remember, which is a different verb,” and the manager blinked like a person who had not known verbs could make an argument. She did not win anything large for the woman, and she did not expect the woman’s gratitude when she won what she could, but she went home and let the success sit next to the failures without making them fight for a chair.

A boy in the year after his voice betrayed him into adulthood was brought into Rook’s orbit because he had found it both easy and fun to walk into people’s yards at night and move their patio furniture into foolish configurations. He called it art in a tone that told you he had learned that calling a thing art is often as good as apologizing. The town had reacted with the humor that grows in people who need to prove they are hearty, until one old man had tripped on a chair in his dark and broken a wrist that had already had its history with ladders. In a room with a table that had forgotten it was meant to be something other than a witness, Rook asked the boy if he could picture a different use of his mischief that did not make the already tender more so. The boy made a joke and then made another and then, like a dog too tired to keep barking, put his head down. They worked out a series of nights where the boy, with supervision and a vest that could be seen from space, would rearrange furniture back after storms and make rounds with a notebook to record fallen downspouts. After the first week the boy’s jokes got funnier because his laughter had become less defensive and more assistive, and Rook asked him if he played chess and he said he liked the knight because it is the only one allowed to act strange.

Some mornings brought the small penance of the mail, and among the junk and warnings and invitations printed on paper guilty of trying too hard, Lindy found an envelope with weight to it that made her thumb feel useful. It was from Ava, and inside was a photograph of a display in the wig room, three stands in a row with different colors arranged so carefully it looked like weather. There was a note on the back in a tidy, deadly font that said, “She understands gentle is not the same as careful,” and the sentence made Lindy sit with her coffee cooling and the day refusing to begin until she had let herself enjoy the thought. Another envelope contained a clipping from the paper with an earnest photo of girls in a church basement cutting their hair and smiling with the grim bravery of people who know they will like themselves better for having done the brave thing. She put both on the refrigerator with a magnet her mother had given her that pretended to be a vintage advertisement for eggs and was actually a reminder that nostalgia’s camouflage is very good.

There was an afternoon where the sky made a threat and kept it, and the culvert filled up to its polite brim and then thought about misbehaving. The town sent men in trucks to check on the known contrarian drains, and one of them backed up to the edge near the bridge and stood with his gloved hands on his hips and tried to look as if he did not worry about the way water talks to itself when it thinks no one is listening. Lindy, who had walked that way out of habit, stood next to him and said nothing, and the two of them watched a pale tennis ball come hurrying down the channel with the urgency of a creature trying to make up for being toy. Above, the train sighed past with a new paint job in a color that could be described only as expensive, and the ducks ignored both man and machine and debated a reed that had ideas above its station. When the rain slackened, the man in the truck tipped his chin, a gesture that is both greeting and truce between strangers, and Lindy returned it because she had learned that civility is not a concession when it is honest.

It was Dr. Saito’s idea to ask Lizzie if she would meet Abbi in a different room than the one with chairs in shameful rows. The new room was a supply closet converted into a counseling nook because space, in buildings that do good, is at a premium and kindness is resourceful. There were shelves with boxes labeled with permanent marker that had done its best and therefore bled. There was a calendar with a cat who seemed to have been told very recently that it is mortal. There were two chairs that had promised not to squeak and a small plant that looked like an apology someone had forgotten to move. When Lizzie came in, she held herself like a person who had promised to keep her back straight for a month, and when Abbi entered, her body did the thing it does when faced with a door it had not expected to open: it tried to be a wall. They sat and the room made its small adjustments, air moving around ears, muscle accommodating the chair’s unyielding memory. “Not to do it again,” Lizzie said, surprising herself by beginning, “that doesn’t feel like mine to ask. But to choose a different thing when you have your hand on a tool—that feels like a prayer I can make.” Abbi nodded and said, “I thought stillness was love,” and Lizzie said, “It is, if you’re a mountain. It’s not, if you’re a man with a morning,” and the plant seemed, ridiculously, to stand up a bit straighter.

The forums passed, the hearings unfolded, the headlines arranged themselves into typefaces and then were folded to line drawers. Abbi moved through days with the awkward grace of a person wearing an outfit they did not pick and learning, slowly, which seams they could adjust without the whole thing falling apart. She kept a notebook with words that had formerly frightened her and now only made her careful, and on the first page she had written allow and underneath it with smaller letters live with. She learned the nurses’ kids’ names without trying and did not say them aloud because some knowledge wishes to stay in the mouth until asked. When Dr. Saito told her about a program that would, after many more signatures and evaluations and arguments, permit her to spend a few hours a week assisting in a salon for patients who volunteered to have their hair tended by apprentices, Abbi said she did not know how not to want too much. “Then start with wanting,” Dr. Saito said, “and learn the art of leaving,” and Abbi laughed because the instruction seemed at once impossible and like the only thing anyone should be taught.

On a Saturday that discovered itself to be beautiful only after lunch, Lindy met Rook at the market that sets up under a parking garage and pretends it’s a piazza. They bought peaches from a woman whose forearms told the truth about lifting crates and listened to a guitarist massacre a standard into gentleness, which is a rare trick. Rook told her about the boy and the chairs and the wrist and how sometimes the apology you engineer for a child is really a joke you tell to his future out loud. Lindy told him about the earrings and how the manager blinked at verbs and how she would never stop marveling at the way the smallest objects become parables when misplaced. They stood near the man who sells honey and tried the one labeled starflower, which tasted insistent and made Lindy think of people who insist their sweetness be noticed. “Do you think,” Rook asked, “that there’s a point when the town stops feeling the need to tell the story and lets it be a thing that happened,” and Lindy said that towns, like families, are never done with any story that allows them to practice who they think they are. “So not really,” she added, and he bought two jars because stocking up is a lie that feels like love.

The night her father called her without a reason, Lindy picked up with the wariness of a woman who had been gifted crises as surprise parties too often to pretend she enjoys spontaneity. He asked what she was doing and she said she was looking for a sentence she had written somewhere that she wanted, which was often true. He said the lights at their house had blinked the other night, too, though their block had kept its pretending, and he had found himself remembering the hospital when his own mother had stared right through him and asked him what time they should leave for the dance. “I told her nine,” he said, and then he laughed because regret will make anything into comedy if you let it. “I think,” he went on, “that I have been wrong about the ratio of judgment to mercy. I don’t need you to agree. I think I say that so you won’t use it on me next time I am being an ass.” Lindy sat on the floor because gravity sometimes asks for that when a parent says a thing they have planned to say for thirty years. She did not reassure him. She told him she would like him to repair another umbrella when he had time, and he said he had time, and then they both said nothing like people confident in their silence.

Under the rail bridge, the graffiti acquired a companion: someone had drawn a rook in chalk, not with a chessboard’s stern perspective but like a castle a child would make out of blocks and desire. Next to it, a hand less confident had written stay kind, and then, as if embarrassed by its own imperative, had added please. The chalk had been rained on and then had made of the rain another medium, and the rook looked to be melting in a way that suggested it was telling you not to take it literally. Ducks ignored it, as is their social contract with reverence. Passersby took pictures and then pretended they hadn’t. A girl wrapping her scarf twice around her impatient throat stopped and rested her fingers on the wall because sometimes a surface that has been touched by many hands is a kind of church, and she did not lie to herself that she was above wanting that.

Ava organized a small ceremony that was not a ceremony to celebrate the new shelf she’d begged for months to be installed, and she invited exactly four people because any more becomes a crowd and crowds misbehave. Dr. Saito came and brought a stiff plant that had learned respect in a previous life and now deserved to rest in a window. Margarita slipped in, a little late and still in her daffodils, because she had walked someone to their car who had left crying and had decided to inventory the weeping to be sure she had not dropped any of it on the stairs. Abbi, escorted by the woman with the clipboard who had learned to walk at a companionable pace, stood with her hands plain at her sides and let someone say her name because it was part of the social choreography of being seen and being allowed. They did not speak much. They looked at the shelf like a new porch and decided it would hold, and then they drank cheap sparkling water and made appreciative noises about bubbles making it feel like a party. Later, alone in the wig room, Ava wrote a label in a hand that did not waver and placed it on the underside of the shelf as if that were where the world keeps its best secrets. It read: leave as you find, love as you can.

There was a heaviness to summers end that did not announce itself with drama but with the way light began to add an apology to its radiance. The market closed earlier, and the library smelled like dust with opinions, and the high school sent out emails about deadlines that managed to be warm and threatening at once. A woman who had promised to bring herself to a volunteer orientation kept her promise and began to arrive early, and even though early is not always useful, the staff said yes because punctuality is a gift that tries too hard and you do not scold a present for that. In a backyard not far from the culvert, a child discovered a nest of hair in the grass that turned out to be a squirrel’s winter plan, and he shouted with a panic so pure it made even the dog ashamed of having barked at so many false alarms. His mother came out, took a look, and decided to tell him that sometimes animals borrow from us without asking, and instead of teaching a rule about ownership she taught the name for the act of not minding when you can afford it.

In the office where wills queue and behave, Lindy found a message on her machine from a woman with a voice like a brisk walk. She said she had read the piece about altars and worst moments and she wanted to know if the office made room for people whose worst moment had lasted ten years. Lindy called back and said of course and scheduled her for a Tuesday morning when the light is least judgmental, and when she arrived, the woman had a binder with tabs and a face that told you everything those tabs were meant to be proof against. They worked through it, line by line, and the word durable got attached to the word power in a way that pleased both of them because power rarely gets to be anything but brittle. When the woman left, she forgot her pen, which had teeth marks on the cap that confided a chew. Lindy put it in the drawer with the letter and the napkins and the magnet and shut it softly, as if not to wake anything.

Rook dreamed not of hair but of scissors, of a hundred pairs opening and closing in a field like a crop of metallic birds, and woke laughing because the sound had been ridiculous. He lay there and counted the seconds until the alarm made its benevolent scold and thought of the boy with the chairs and the rook drawn in chalk and the way kindness, when you practice, sharpens not your edges but your eyes. When the day threw its iced roads at him and he slid the way everyone slid, he did not consider himself special for having kept upright. He went to the middle school again because rumor grows back like hair and you must keep brushing it, and a girl asked him if monsters ever rehabilitate, which is a word most children do not keep in their lunchboxes. “Sometimes,” he said, “if the room has windows,” and she said her homeroom did not, and he said maybe you can be the window for a minute then, and the kids around her did the invisible rearrangement that accompanies someone being handed a job.

On a quiet morning at the facility, the woman with the clipboard told Abbi that there would be a visitor, and Abbi thought of all the visitors she had not had and let herself be willing, which is not the same as brave but is adjacent. The visitor was the resident’s mother, thin in the way that suggests nerves have been eating more calories than the body can spare, and she had the face of someone who collects others’ cups after dinner to keep the tablecloth from getting ruined. They sat in the room with the cat calendar and the permanent marker ghosts and said hello three times each to get the word to behave. The mother said she had brought nothing because gifts felt like coercion, and Abbi said that was correct and not necessary, and the mother said the word son as if saying it would sew edges. “He fell asleep everywhere,” she said, and they both smiled without humor. “If I could have kept him awake with a spell, I would have been a witch,” the mother said, and Abbi said, “If I could have learned to leave something alone and have that be love, I would have been a god,” and the two sentences made a kind of accord between them that both knew would evaporate if they stared too bluntly. They left the room at the same time and one of them said nothing else and one of them said take care, which might have been both of them.

Later that week, Lindy baked a cake because she had not baked a cake in a long time and because the thing you can measure in cups and teaspoons can sometimes keep your fingers from asking too many questions. She brought half to her parents without making a ceremony of it and set it on the kitchen counter next to a coil of orange extension cord that had acquired a permanent lay. Her mother made a face that said it was too rich and then, in a movement that was a love letter to human inconsistency, cut herself a slice as wide as a middle finger. Her father looked out the window and said the lilac would need attention come spring, and she said she would help without sarcastic commentary, and he said he would believe it when he saw it, and she said that was the bargain. In the hall closet, the umbrellas leaned on one another like exhausted aristocrats, and she touched their handles the way you touch a friend you do not need to wake. Outside, the air made the sound of being between seasons, and she stepped into it with her coat open because sometimes you insult the cold to remember your own blood. She thought of Abbi, and of beans, and of a bridge that had become a radiantly ordinary place to pass, and she let the day be, which is the laziest and bravest verb she knew how to carry.By the time the prairie people stapled their polite orange signs in Helvetica to the fence—Prescribed Burn Today, Smoke May Be Visible—the neighborhood had already made its own announcements. Laundry hesitated on lines; dogs argued theology with the wind; a man on a deck in a T-shirt performed the ancient ritual of sniffing and pretending to identify wood by the color of smoke. The field on the far side of the bike path took the fire the way a forgiven person takes a hug: stiffly at first, and then with an accuracy that seemed almost practiced. Flames made that low, competent sound that belongs to kitchens and old barns, and a thin bravado of ash blew east as if it had somewhere important to be. Inside the smell was memory’s accomplice. People thought of camping trips badly planned and hair singed by a birthday candle and a winter where the oven did the work because the heat had given up. There were three calls to dispatch in as many minutes from citizens who felt ignored by the posted signs and wanted a person to promise them in a new voice that this was not the beginning of terrible things. Rook leaned an elbow on the window ledge in the small room where phones become confessions and said the sentence he had practiced: it is tending, not righteousness; it is discipline masquerading as mischief; it is what love looks like when you let experts carry matches.

At the facility the windows proposed a muted version of the same event, the field across the road performing a controlled kind of surrender. The beans in the raised bed had started to brown with a pride that offended no one, and Abbi stood with her hands inside the sleeves of her sweatshirt and watched smoke make modest geometries above the scrub. Dr. Saito came to stand at her left, and for a moment they were simply two people sharing a view, not a program. “They come in and take away what is already done and what cannot keep living, to make room,” she said, not as a lesson but because the air asked for narration. “There are people who prefer a field to look perfect without scorch marks. They don’t like the smell. But this is how prairie remembers itself. It’s not the same as what you did. It is the difference between cutting and letting a season end on purpose.” Abbi’s mouth tugged at a shape that wanted to be both grief and obedience. “When they leave,” she said, after the firefighters had made their courteous bow and trucks rolled away, “everyone thinks the field is hurt. It looks bad, for a while.” Dr. Saito nodded. “Yes. And then the green will be laughing at us before we are ready to be relieved.”

There are invitations that announce themselves in heavy envelopes as if to prove their seriousness, and there are invitations that arrive by phone in the gulfs between errands. The hospital’s came both ways, decorated with phrases that wanted to be neutral and landed as a dare. Listening After, the panel was called, a phrase that made Lindy bite the inside of her cheek because it suggested a before had been a time for something else and she did not accept that premise. She accepted anyway. The nurses were tired in the saintly way people like to praise until it looks like a trap, the administrators were tired in the haughtier way of people whose tiredness is considered noble because it is accompanied by suits, and a junior publicist had learned to say words like narrative and align as if they originated in her throat rather than in meetings. Lindy ironed a shirt because crispness, unlike justice, can be achieved by heat and flatness, and she pinned her hair up out of habit, which is not the same as strategy. Her father called to ask if she had an umbrella, and she said she did, and he said bring two, one to break and one to fix.

The auditorium did its usual impression of a well-meaning whale, swallowing everyone and trying to keep them comfortable while they considered whether to be nervous. Lindy watched faces the way some people watch clouds for shapes. She saw a woman with callused hands unlace her fingers and place them on her knees as if they needed to be convinced to act natural, and a man in a blazer sit with the posture of someone who has learned to layer his chair with proof of his status. “Listening After is about allowing truth into rooms designed to repel it,” the moderator said with the eager voice of the newly converted, and Lindy’s smile was private. When it was her turn, she said that after is not when you finally get quiet; it is when the noise changes species. She talked about windows and mirrors and the harm done when institutions behave like mirrors to each other and windows to no one. A nurse named Kema told them all gently that fear makes you drop your kindness like a hot pan and that the trick is to pick it up again before it sets. A man from security said cameras are not ears and the room made the collective murmur that means people have learned a fact they will forget by dinner. They gave everyone the small clamshell of applause the town offers when it wants to be politely seen doing the right thing, and out in the hallway the coffee performed its tithe to Styrofoam while a woman teared up because her daughter had a rash and the Peds resident had been beautiful to them and words were poor tools when you wanted to be grateful to a stranger.

Lizzie, always a bearer of new choreographies for pain, found herself at the community college one Tuesday in front of a class called Health Humanities, a title she had mocked softly in her kitchen and then practiced not mocking aloud. She stood between a whiteboard that had seen too much and a row of students with the focused cruelty of youth and told them that appointments have emotions and that the waiting room’s clock is rarely telling the time you think it is. She held up nothing—no mementos, no letters, no photographs—because props would have sucked the air into themselves, and she needed the air for her story. She told them about the one small curl that had been keeping June on the calendar and how she had thrown it away like a woman who refuses to keep trophies, even sad ones. She told them she didn’t forgive in any sweeping way and that she had discovered that forgiveness, in her, is a collection of small negotiations with the day: this morning I will not think angry thoughts about a stranger’s braid; this afternoon I will look at a man’s beard and consider it just his. A boy in a hat he was pretending not to be attached to asked if she believed in closure, and she said that the only thing that closes is a drawer and sometimes an eye and a mouth when it is done saying what it can say.

One of Margarita’s patients—Mrs. Olsson, who collected church bulletins the way other women collect t-shirts from concerts—had returned with a hand that did not open as wide as it used to and a mouth eager to make of it a story. Margarita listened, because she is in the business of fluids and narratives both, and when the doctor tapped on tendons and declared the probability of tenotomy, Mrs. Olsson lost the plot for a second and asked instead where hair goes when you brush it in a bathroom with the window open. “Birds,” Margarita pronounced, and the woman smiled deep as an etching because the idea that nests are made of us and we are accomplice to shelter pleased her to a ridiculous degree. In the break room, the kettle complained precisely where it always did, and the tea tasted like the color brown, and she thought affectionately of the laminated matrix that had replaced the spoon and key with lanyards and permissions and how quickly the nurses had turned it into a song only they knew how to hum.

Ava’s kingdom had grown a shelf and a philosophy, which is a good ratio for any room. She decided it was time to wheel her kindness to a clinic two towns over that carried a different hum and a more desperate smell, and she recruited people whose hands knew how to offer before they corrected. She asked for a small letter from Abbi, not because she intended to read it to anyone but because the act of writing an instruction for care is one of the sly ways you teach your mind that control is not the point, participation is. Abbi printed carefully on paper that made her wrist behave: hold the hair like it has been listened to; do not hurry the part; ask before you sift; never make a compliment into a command. Ava taped the letter to the underside of a bin where only someone who tidies would ever find it, which, in her world, is how an altar gets its power.

The burn on the prairie took an afternoon to calm and two days to stop being the first sentence anyone said on a porch. Somewhere between them a rumor tried to stand again and failed. A boy with a leaf blower and too much time told his cousin he had seen a small figure on the far side of the field with a pair of scissors glittering in the smoke, and his cousin told the internet, and the internet did what it does: it made the small bigger and the true irrelevant. Rook, who had begun to develop the same gentle impatience with rumor that he had with the microwave’s pretensions to efficiency, went to the gas station and asked the boy to show him the glitter. The boy’s hand made slogans in the air and pointed at sunlight and the metallic whisper of beetle wings, and Rook talked to him about fireworks by day and how light is always looking for something to be seen on. On his walk back to the squad he passed under the bridge and saw that someone had added to the chalk rook: a crown, off-center and kid-confident, and three new words in a hand he recognized as the same one that loved circles. this is yours, it said, then, smaller, ours. He let his fingers pick up a faint white and told himself to remember that the difference between vandalism and tutelage is often only whether the drawing teaches us where to look.

The library hosted a fix-it night because mending is a politics far more appealing than debate, and Lindy brought the two umbrellas to a table where people talked about pressure washers and waffle irons as if they were finally giving old friends their due. Her father arrived in a mood he labeled as practical and everyone else would have called tender if they wanted to get away with it. He applied oil with a reverence that would have embarrassed him if anyone had said so aloud and coaxed the bent brass back toward its original intention while telling a story about his mother’s brusque competence he had not told before. “She thought rain was an inconvenience you partnered with,” he said, eyes on the mechanism, “and that umbrellas were less a defense than a courtesy you offered your own shoulders.” “She sounds like someone I would have enjoyed being corrected by,” Lindy said, and he did the smile where his mouth makes one decision and his eyes make another. On the walk home a drizzle did the halfhearted thing that lets you make choices, and they made different ones—he kept his umbrella open because there is dignity in using what you have restored; she closed hers because grace sometimes looks like refusing protection for a block.

Abbi’s Tuesdays with the rolling case had been upgraded to Thursdays in a room with a mirror that worked only as a mirror, not as an indictment. The woman who came to her that afternoon was younger than the word patient makes a person in your mind; she had curls like language that refuses to be standardized and a fear of clippers born not of sound but of a bad memory. “We don’t have to do anything,” Abbi said, and she meant it with a steadiness that surprised even her. They combed for a while instead, with the comb that made a sound like writing in a generous hand, and when they finally did cut, they did it six hairs at a time, pausing after each to check whether regret had entered the room. It had not. When it was over, the woman blinked at herself and made the face people make when they have changed but chosen how. She reached up as if to touch Abbi’s wrist and then did not, a small, beautiful not, and said thank you in a tone that suggested she had located a verb more useful than forgive.

The beans grew pods that first jangled at every breeze and then hung as if practicing at being nouns. Dr. Saito proposed leaving some, an indulgence the garden recommended but the report would not notice, and Abbi agreed with the solemnity of a novice who knows she is being trusted. When it came time to harvest, she practiced not harvesting, which is the grammar behind so many words we pretend are higher math. She plucked and then abstained, plucked and then abstained, until the pattern felt less like punishment and more like choreography. Later, she split a dried pod with her thumb and admired the beans’ audacity—the way they had the gall to be glossy in so tired a world—and pocketed one and then, recalling the letter she had written to the underside of a bin, put it back with a theatricality that made Dr. Saito laugh without spoiling the sanctity of the gesture.

On a night warm enough to make the facility hum like a building trying to be friendly, the power flirted with failure and then gave up in a long, luxurious sigh. The generator coughed itself awake and offered columns of light like a marching band, and in the spaces between them were commas of dark where panic likes to set up shop. Abbi sat up and counted not ceiling tiles, which she could not see, but her own inhales and exhales because numbers sometimes boss you into obedience when nothing else will. A woman down the hall called out in a voice pitched at wolves, and an orderly with an unembarrassed gait appeared in the doorway to ask, without great ceremony, who needed holding and who needed reminding. Abbi stood and asked where she might be useful, and the orderly said, “The woman in 6C needs someone to talk to her about birds,” and she went, because duty in this place often wears a disguise of kindness so obvious it would be rude to remark upon it. In the chair by the window the 6C woman told her a story about a swallow’s nest and a summer with a boy whose hair never did what it was told, and they watched a dark that was only half committed and waited for the returning light with the patience of people who have learned to stop volunteering for emergencies unless asked.

“Lady Lindy” turned up again in a letterhead as if it were a baroness who refuses to leave a party after being uninvited repeatedly, and this time it was attached to a fundraiser with a scandalous budget and a theme that made Lindy whisper a word she would not use in court. Staying Power, the invitation declared, and there would be cocktails with names and a silent auction of items that tried too hard to be experience. She RSVPed no and went instead to a kitchen table where a woman with paper calendars like prayer flags across her wall asked for help making her brother stop trying to sell their mother’s house while she was still rehearsing not falling down the back step. The forms were not interesting; the signatures were. Lindy found the right page and made it say what it should and left with her hair smelling like onions in oil and a promise folded into her pocket from the woman’s dog, who had leaned his entire head into her thigh as if to deposit trust.

The bridge had acquired a tradition that no one would dare call that for fear of sounding like they cared too much about a piece of concrete. On Saturday evenings, without planning and therefore with sanctity, people gathered in ones and twos to read graffiti as if it were the town’s Bible accordion-folded. A girl who had been at the library reading about monsters that turn out not to be monsters brought her mother, who had never stepped off the sidewalk without cause. They stood under the word breathe, which had been refreshed by a mysterious benefactor who clearly likes beans and coils their e’s accordingly, and they did the thing the wall asked for and then, weirdly and correctly, did it again. A boy chalked a second rook lower down where small children could touch it, and someone wrote stay curious, be kind and then crossed out be because imperatives are easier when they are we, and underneath someone else wrote together as if the chalk had discovered it could be humble. Lindy and Rook arrived late and did not say anyone’s names. They took the ritual for what it was—the town’s refusal to let one story be nobility and tragedy both—and leaned on the cool railing watching ducks make their usual case for acceptance.

The first snow came like a secret being whispered to the pavement, and then like a secret being whispered in a less competent voice, and then like gossip, all at once. In the kitchen Lindy reached for the mended umbrella out of fondness and then put it down because the project of falling in love with her own scalp’s weather seemed more urgent. She went outside and let flakes insist on her face, and she made the face she had made as a child when water surprised her, and for a second she wished absurdly for an audience. Her father, two miles away, stood at the back door with his arms folded as if he were negotiating with the cold and told it that his daughter is stubborn and so is he, and perhaps it could have mercy if it had any to spare. At the clinic, Margarita pulled the door closed hard enough to make it behave and looked at her own reflection in the glass for a second longer than her schedule allowed. Lizzie opened a window and tasted air as if it were a fruit misnamed, and then shut it because the house had its opinion. In her room Abbi stood where the radiator clicked and held her palm over the place where heat decided to enter and said aloud, without asking anyone to explain science to her, “Stay as long as you can, then go,” and if the room answered it did so in the old way, with pipes pretending to be a choir.

The winter taught its usual thesis, and the town, having sworn it would not be surprised again, was surprised in all the same ways, which is another form of reassurance. The prairie grew a hypocrisy of green right at the burned line’s edge sooner than seemed reasonable, and the controlled fire was vindicated by shoots that behaved like teeth learning to be confident. Ava put hats on women who tried not to weep at their own loveliness and failed with dignity. Dr. Saito attended a conference where someone talked about harm in the voice academics use when they are afraid they might actually be heard; she came back and watered the plant in the counseling closet and asked it, politely, to stay. Rook shoveled his aunt’s stoop and listened to her tell him not to be ridiculous about the ice because at this point in life it was the only thing she expected to clear without paperwork. Lindy wrote a letter to no one that started Dear Chapter Eight because she had seen the phrase on a program somewhere and liked the mischief of addressing a number, and she made a list of the rooms with windows and the rooms that insist on mirrors and vowed, not in any noble way, to move chairs where she could. A train at Washington Street did what trains do and committed its body to the task of going, and people on the platform took the step back together and then forward together when the right clear came, which is the daily choreography by which we admit that we are dangerous to one another and insist on being tender anyway.The thaw did not ask permission so much as arrive with its small insistences, knocking on each surface until even the stubborn ones softened. The prairie, which had looked like a humility lesson after the burn, began to put on its green like a person tugging on a sweater that somehow makes their posture kinder. The culvert fattened and then learned the art of draining politely; the bridge’s acoustics lost their winter tin and found a rounder sound for traffic; the graffiti kept its vow and let the word breathe darken after each rain as if refreshed by a hand that would not sign its art. Ducks arranged themselves on the water the way a family arranges themselves on a couch when a show they’ve all seen before comes on, and every so often one would make that rude little noise as a reminder that reverence is a seasonal hobby at best. On Washington, the train made its promise and kept it while commuters adjusted their faces from winter to something less armored, and under the rails a girl chalked a rook and then, carefully, a second rook lower down where small hands could leave their committee prints without being scolded.

The clinic reinhabited its mornings with a kind of brave banality. The lights came up in a sequence that paid no mind to memory; the kettle sang its one-note hymn; Margarita hung her new ID on its lanyard without looking at the picture because photographs taken under fluorescent lights tell a truth no one ever needed. She had developed a habit, in these months, of naming the first patient of the day in her head as if greeting a ship, and this morning it was a man who insisted on calling Vitamin D sunshine pills, and she resisted the urge to correct him because the metaphor did no harm and a little nonsense early is a vaccine for the later bureaucracies. A young doctor with a tie that hadn’t learned where to rest its own arrogance had begun a probationary month, and Margarita watched him the way you watch a new driver merge: alert to the ways in which flinching can be more dangerous than audacity. He asked questions that were almost good and listened like he was practicing for the time when listening will be his only useful skill, and when he spoke of Dr. Weller he did it with the carefulness of someone who has learned that names here are not just nouns but rooms the living are still visiting.

Lindy returned to her alphabet and found that the letters had, in her absence, rearranged themselves into a more generous order. People came with folders and hopes and stories they thought needed to apologize for themselves, and she had begun to interrupt that apologizing with a practiced hand, the way you lift the pot before the boil over and save the stove from a day of scouring. The case that found her in this thaw came folded into the good paper used by people who want to be believed on the first try: a barbershop that had been in the same storefront long enough to grow an actual memory, fined by the city for a lapsed inspection that the owner swore had been scheduled and then unscheduled by an officious email she did not receive because her grandson had deleted a spam folder with the confidence of a monarch. The barbershop had mirrors that had watched three generations learn where to look when they wanted to be braver and where to look when they wanted to be forgiven. The owner’s name was Queenie because her mother had believed in naming girls like declarations, and she wore her grief for a husband in the elegant way some women wear a scarf. Lindy sat in the spinning chair and let Queenie demonstrate the clippers’ purr as if she were introducing a friend with a reputation to a room still deciding whether to loosen its tie. The argument with the city was, as always, about the difference between policy and sense, and about whether a signature in April can absolve a lapse in February even if the lapse made no one less safe, and Lindy found herself, to her own chagrin, enjoying the fight more than she enjoyed the victory she could already feel agree to come and sit on the bench beside her.

Rook’s spring wore a badge and a obliging set of meetings about nuisance complaints that taste like dry toast until you put them together and realize they’re the way a town tells itself stories when it has sworn off drama. Lawns had been mowed at night without consent into spirals and labyrinths and, in one case, a very good attempt at a whale. People were infuriated and delighted, sometimes in the same syllable. He went to three porches and let men in sweatshirts tell him about boundaries as if teaching a civics class to a student who had arrived late on purpose. At one house he found hair—not the blackmailing ring of absence he had come to hate as a symbol, but a tuft of dog trimmed on a stoop while the animal slept and then arranged like a small crown on a garden gnome. Rumor tried to make a cousin of that, and he declined the invitation firmly but kindly. He called the kid who had taken to rearranging patio chairs during the winter and asked, without accusation, whether he had a cousin with a mower and an interest in geometry, and the boy laughed the laugh of someone being granted adulthood by implication and said he did, and Rook asked him to put a leash on the cousin or get him a permit because sometimes the difference between art and an ordinance violation is a phone call made in daylight.

Abbi’s version of spring smelled like disinfectant, soil, and hair products with names that sound like wishes. The program that had grown out of Dr. Saito’s efficient and tender persistence shifted from Tuesdays to also Thursdays, and the rolling case rolled with a confidence that comes from having survived travel. Ava expanded her dominion to include a small classroom of hands that needed to learn gentleness and a mirror that was there not to judge but to show. The first time Abbi held scissors in that room, fully, and not just to carry them like a talisman allowed inside the circle, her body remembered too much, and she set them down with the deliberation of a person acknowledging a past without inviting it to stay for lunch. They began, cheekily and correctly, by trimming doll wigs for a group of kids whose mothers needed to practice sitting down, and Abbi found in the repetition a way to make a different association stick: ask, draw breath, place the comb, lift, snip, pause, look at the eyes in the mirror that are already communicating more consent than the mouth knows how to frame. “Hold the hair like it has been listened to,” she had written for the underside of a bin in Ava’s room, and here she learned that writing about tenderness is like describing rain to a roof; you must test your thesis under weather. By the fourth week she could trim the nape of a neck without a single muscle translating the task into anything other than what it was, and after one woman with laugh lines like parentheses left with the bob she had described as “the one where I look like I know the answer without being mean about it,” Abbi sat down hard in the back room and let herself feel as if she had moved a small country from one border to another without starting a war.

Lizzie had learned to put the cardboard boxes on the floor one at a time and never stack them, because grief, like flour, behaves badly when it spills. One of them arrived from a storage unit that had been paid for until someone remembered to cancel it, and inside was a collection of small betrayals and tendernesses: a pen that did not write and would never be thrown away, a sweater with a snag the size of a apology, a list in Dr. Weller’s hand of people he meant to call with stars next to the names as if even his procrastination had wanted to be helpful. She found, tucked in the back of a calendar like a leaf pressed by mistake, a continuation of the hair story she had tried not to be making: a photograph from fifteen years ago in which his hair flopped as if tired of being good, and she surprised herself by laughing aloud because what had been taken had also been ridiculous, and claiming the absurdity was another way back into the house of her days. The hospital had asked if they could name a lecture after him, the kind they bring residents to and instruct them in the humanities while the humanities sit politely in the corner and try not to judge the PowerPoint. She said yes and also said no to the slide they proposed with his face large enough to startle a stranger, and they compromised on a line he had once sent himself in an email at 2:13 a.m., “Ask the dumb follow-up question; it is usually the honest one.” She brought Margarita to the first of those lectures because it seemed both correct and not nearly enough, and they sat in the back and passed between them a lint roller like a secret as the presenter talked about consent in sentences that wanted to be verbs and the room performed its attention.

There was a parade again because towns provide themselves with cyclical comfort and because flags like to practice their wrists in spring. Abbi, in a supervised cluster that refused the word chaperoned but embraced the habit, watched from a corner near a lamppost that had learned the art of being a landmark without assuming airs. She was, to her surprise and a little shame, happy. Drums far away are the heartbeat of buildings that have decided to try, and the trumpet section did what trumpets always do and made the teenagers in the crowd laugh because earnestness is infectious when its tone is right. A barbershop quartet appeared as if summoned by a cosmic need for harmony, and Queenie was among them, astonishment in her alto, singing about the trivial griefs of men at the mercy of women and laughing with her eyes to make the lyric safe. Across the street a man in a white coat caught a piece of confetti in his hair and left it there, and Abbi felt the old tickle in her fingers converted, slowly and with great effort, into an observation she did not act on: some adornments are the world’s and do not require curating. A child beside her asked if hair is alive, and she said yes and no in a sentence that made the child satisfied and the woman with the clipboard exhale like she had been believing they would find their way back to this exact corner of competence all along.

Queenie’s hearing with the city unfolded in a room with chairs that had been admitted into public service after a lifetime in church basements. The man in charge of permitting had perfected an aura of disappointed benevolence and used it like a monopoly, and Lindy felt her chest do that avian flutter that means a predator of a different kind is present. She did not let the flutter decide her pace. She brought the emails and the signatures and the printouts of inspection reports with dates that behaved, and she brought affidavits that smelled like talc because they lived in drawers with combs, and she brought Queenie and Queenie’s grandson, who was flush with the shame of understanding that deleting an email can be a political act. Lindy spoke in the language of policy until policy was satisfied it had been respected and then switched to the language of sense. She told them that the building inspector’s absence had been the kind of absence all weather has and that the risk had been theoretical in the way that makes the theoretical both important and easily converted into theater. The permitting man asked whether precedent would be injured by lenience, and Lindy let him see that she kept a small penknife for cutting smiles into the shape of sincerity and did not bring it out here. They won because it had always been winnable and because occasionally, when you put the mirror down, even a bureaucracy looks out the window.

On a Tuesday that wanted to be Friday, a rumor set its hooks into the internet about a new cutting in the night, and Rook treated it the way a man treats an old back injury, with attention and without dignifying it. The photograph was of hair in a circle on the hood of a car, strands arranged with the care of a person whose heart wants drama and whose hands cannot be left alone without work. He found the car and the hair because the car was the only one on the block that had suffered a sincere detail, and the hair smelled like dryer sheets, which is not how hair smells when it has been asked to leave someone’s body by force. He spoke to the young woman who had posted the picture and learned, in ten minutes, that what she wanted was an audience for a day that had not otherwise acknowledged her. He did not scold; he introduced the idea that the world does not reward everyone for their sadness and that sometimes it will, if asked, offer a different prize for a different submission. When he left, the post had been edited to say “hair art,” which is not a phrase the town had asked for but was better than the alternative, and he allowed himself the gentle vice of buying a truly terrible coffee from a machine that was honest about its limitations and drank it outside where the air apologized for the taste.

Lindy’s father returned the umbrella with a flourish that would not have been wise if the ceiling had been lower. He had smoothed the brass to near-competence and had left a small nick on purpose because he had noticed that perfection in objects makes them too precious to be used, and he wanted his daughter to be able to take the thing into weather without thinking of heritage. She thanked him with a language they had learned together, the language of the deniable. He told her the story of his own father’s umbrella, a cheap black dome that functioned mainly as an excuse for him to feel prepared, and how once, during a summer storm that made the alleys sing, it had turned inside out and he had sworn at it in a register his son had never heard before and then laughed the way a man laughs when the world reminds him he is a participant and not a planner. They stood in her kitchen while the spring performed at the window like a choir that knows the music and spills it too loudly anyway, and he told her, unprompted, that he had read about the forum and wanted to unroll his old snobberies for inspection, and she said he could leave them on the hall rug like muddy shoes and see in the morning whether they had shrunk.

A hospital administrator who had once been a nurse remembered that corridors become honest rooms when you put chairs in them, and so a pilot program bloomed: the Salon Corridor, Thursdays from one to four, three chairs, two volunteer stylists, a cart with a mirror that had learned to be kind. Abbi’s name was put on a list with the kind of incident reports that make lists nervous, and someone in a meeting said the word risk with a softness that sounded like the beginning of wisdom. Her first afternoon in that corridor, the air tasted like the ends of words spoken quietly. A woman with a scarf tied with impatience asked for what she called a nice blunt, and Abbi nodded as if acquainted with the niceness waiting in geometry, and together they made the line, slow and pleasing, the kind of straight that learns curves first so as not to be arrogant. A nurse pushed by with an IV pole that had decided to audition for ballet; a toddler in a stroller announced bubble to no one in particular; a doctor paused at the water fountain and blinked at the tableau as if he had stumbled into a small domestic scene in the middle of efficiency and was not offended. Abbi wrapped a strand around her finger to show how much would go, showed it again, waited, then cut with a sound that, in some rooms, is the end of something and here felt more like a sentence finding its period.

The second time Lizzie said yes to a meeting with Abbi, it took place not in a closet disguised as a counseling space but on a bench in a courtyard that had the manners to offer one tree with a lesson about shade. They sat close enough that any passerby would mislabel them as friends and far enough apart that if someone with a clipboard insisted on proving their diligence it would not be a lie to call the arrangement professional. Lizzie arrived with a paper cup of coffee so hot it made sincerity of everything it touched, and Abbi arrived with a readiness that was not bravery but its cousin. They did not do the thing where you perform your journey for one another and risk turning your day into a TED talk. They traded nouns. Lizzie said daffodil in a way that told Abbi a story about a patch of ridiculous yellow that had shown up in her yard the week after the calendar had dared to call the season spring. Abbi said bean, almost shyly, and Lizzie laughed because the modesty of a plant that becomes a staple always pleased her. They agreed, not aloud but in the way women do when they have decided not to unmake each other, that the project here was staying, not forgiving, and when the sun moved and forced them to choose between squinting and relocation, they both, without comment, chose to squint and let their eyes water rather than edit the rigor of their bench.

At the library, a bulletin board that usually advertises potlucks and the indignities of the copier sprawled under a new banner: Fix-It Night, Bring Your Objects and Your Patience. Lindy saw it on a Tuesday when her cases had all ended with the noise paper makes when it believes it has accomplished something, and she decided to bring nothing and simply sit. It was holy to watch a toaster disassembled by a woman whose nails were honest about her priorities; to see a teenager explain to an elderly man the difference between a wire fatigued and a wire merely sulking; to hear someone say the sentence “it might just need to be loved differently” to a sewing machine that had asked for mercy by way of thread snarls. The man who had once been her opponent over the question of where hair belonged rolled in with a lamp that did not like to be helpful, and they nodded in a way that protects both people from having to guess what the other person is pretending not to remember. On the floor near the coat rack a child drew chalk pictures because a community center always has chalk somewhere, and when he tried to make a rook and made instead an earnest rectangle with enthusiasm on top, Lindy felt something she had not noticed loosen in her ribs and thought, not derisively, that accuracy is rarely the thing that saves us.

Ava opened her wig room on a Saturday she had promised herself to keep for laundry, because someone had called with a voice that turned the lock from the other side. The woman was twenty-two and furious and so beautiful with her scarf off that Ava had to look at her feet at first because praise sometimes has to be held back or it becomes a weapon. Abbi was there because it was her day to practice saying yes without trying to outpace the invitation. They did not rush. They took down three stands and made a ritual of not choosing. The young woman said she had been told words like brave so often she had begun to keep them like prizes in a box she never opened, and Abbi told her she could leave them on the floor under the chair and they would not be counted as trash. The first wig had too much certainty and the second too much apology, and the third sat on her head like an argument she had already won. When they were done, Abbi swept as if the broom were a pen and the floor a page, and she looked, involuntarily and then on purpose, out the small window at a bird making incursions into a nest that had seen better architecture. She did not take a strand of anything outside. She did not need to. Birds are excellent thieves; it is not necessary to be their accomplice to participate in shelter.

On a morning when clouds had made a bargain with the light to behave theatrically, Dr. Saito put a seed catalog down on a table hard enough to make a sound because she had discovered that patients listen better when they are offered something that has a picture on it and a number you can circle. “You have opinions now,” she told Abbi in a tone that made the sentence a compliment, “we can plant accordingly.” They talked about what grows as if deciding what to forgive, and they settled on herbs because nothing else advertises its purpose to the air with so much unapologetic vigor. Basil for the smell that makes you believe in summer; thyme because it sounds like the thing they keep trying to edit and cannot; rosemary because it is both handsome and fond of reminding you it once grew wild. Abbi touched the page the way you touch a hand you are deciding to trust, and then she said, with the investigative smallness of someone taking the measure of language that has been unkind to her, that she is not sure she knows how to be outside without trying to own what she likes. Dr. Saito said that liking is a loan, not a deed, and they laughed at the ridiculousness of a metaphor that nevertheless made a few molecules learn better posture.

The town, which had learned to preach to itself in chalk, decided to add paint. A mural committee born of a PTA meeting that had run overtime set its sights on the wall under the bridge that had taught everyone to inhale on command. Meetings were held in rooms where folding chairs contribute to civic virtue by making the body eager to agree just to be allowed to stand. Art students at the high school came with sketches that were both too earnest and not earnest enough. The city fretted about the liability of ladders and the expense of primer. A woman who had never been listened to by a committee before realized the trick of speaking third, not first or last, and earning the right to voice the compromise. In the end the paint went up in layers that dried before anyone could object, blues like arguments you can see the bottom of, greens that flirted shamelessly with their own brightness, the rook drawn by someone whose hand had not been taught to be ashamed, the word breathe preserved inside a field of curling vines that pretended to be hair and then chose not to be. On the day the mural finished, the boy from the gas station stood with his hands in his pockets and pretended to be impressed only by the scaffolding, and Rook said, for the benefit of no one in particular, that in this town art appears not as mercy but as maintenance, and the boy nodded, not understanding yet and also understanding more than anyone had any right to expect.

A small storm that had been promised to stay polite decided to throw a tantrum around three in the afternoon, and the Salon Corridor buckled its schedule to make room for drying and apology. Abbi, whose hair had grown into a soft certainty that did not need commentary, felt the old energy crackle under her skin like static when sweaters misbehave, and she thought the sentence she had learned to use when her body got louder than the room: not every feeling requires an action. The hallway, with its shined floor and its temporary salon smelling like a rebellion that had read the rules, absorbed the weather and maintained its function. A woman came, wet at the edges and laughing, and asked if there was time for bangs before triage, and Abbi, with the grave humor of someone multiplying the correct risk, said yes, because it is both safe and unwise to make life-altering decisions in a storm, and because bangs are a religion that does not require attendance more than once every six weeks. They trimmed, and the woman, brand-new at the forehead, went to her appointment and texted her sister a selfie with a caption that said something about control in lowercase.

The field that had been burned went green like an admission. The scorched places showed their usefulness by disappearing into the project of growth, and the prescribed fire signs were taken down and rolled at their poles’ feet like flags after a parade. In the raised bed, thyme made a bid for empire and basil remained melodramatic and rosemary behaved like the uncle who sits at the end of the table and offers pronouncements that are sometimes entirely true. Dr. Saito brought a knife to the garden because you have to pretend you are civilized when you harvest, and Abbi cut stems with a reverence that did not embarrass either of them. They carried the bowl like a quiet, and in the kitchen that had learned not to be a sterile room first, they tore leaves with fingers that had lately been trusted with strangers’ edges. The smell was a kind of confession, the honest kind that makes everyone in the room feel like they have accidentally been forgiven for something they had not gotten around to naming.

Summer promised, as it usually does, that it would be generous before becoming oppressive. The town believed it briefly. Every day around four, the light slanted over the tracks and made the bridge look like it belonged to a different city, one that had learned to make a living out of its picturesque corners. Lindy and Rook found themselves on a bench near the wig room on a Tuesday that had overperformed. They spoke of nothing and then of policy and then of whether ice cream could be considered a civic duty in June. He told her about the boy and the lawn art and the gnome crown, and she told him about Queenie and the inspected clippers and the grandson learning the humility of a receipt, and they agreed that competence makes friendship easier. A woman pushing a stroller stopped to fix a buckle that had learned to be perverse, and she apologized to them, which is what women do in public spaces for existing near people who might be in a hurry, and Lindy told her to take her time with such ease that the woman’s shoulders dropped and the baby, who could not yet speak, made a noise like gratitude two minutes later that everyone agreed to attribute to good human design.

On the night that heat finally got its way and lay on the town like an animal in need of petting, the facility’s generator hiccuped and then behaved. Abbi woke and counted ichthyologically—one, two, three, fins, tail—because numbers get bored and must be tricked. Down the hall a woman spoke a man’s name, not the resident’s, and then laughed at herself and said the name again like she was polishing it. In the morning the air was heavy with the certainty of storms, and she pulled on the sweatshirt that had become the uniform of her trying and went with Dr. Saito to the room with the mirror and the rolling cart and the empty chair that behaved like a promise. They were early, which is often the only luxury available to people who cannot choose most things, and for a minute they stood each in their own window and watched the world prepare to be wet. “Do you think,” Abbi said, and the pause between think and the rest of the sentence was a small progress report from the factory of her mind, “that we will always need to remember to ask first, or will it become a habit we hate and then a habit we love.” Dr. Saito said that habits are like haircuts; the first one is thrilling, the second is maintenance, and the third is how you find out whether you meant it, and Abbi laughed, a startled sound that made a volunteer at the end of the hall look up and locate its source with the happy suspicion that joy might be contagious.

When the rain finally came, it did not apologize for being late. It slammed its hand on the table and insisted on being met where it was. Lindy, halfway to her car, decided to commit the minor sin of walking without protection and felt the sudden intimacy of being pelted as if the sky had decided to remember her name. Her father would have scolded, in his old life, misplaced discipline masquerading as care, but his new life had taught him to keep certain sentences in his pocket until they warmed to the temperature of kindness. She reached the bridge without meaning to, which is how people stumble into churches, and stood under its lip where water organizes itself into rivulets that look like handwriting. The rook on the wall wept chalk in elegant failure, and someone had added a small note in pencil beneath the word breathe that said thank you in a hand that could have been anyone’s. She touched the word with two fingers as if checking for a fever and stood there until she had reminded herself that endings are a rumor we tell ourselves so we can agree to be brave in episodes. On Washington, the train groaned and then committed, and in the wig room a woman took off her scarf and let a stranger show her the face she had chosen, and Abbi, having asked, lifted a strand between her fingers and cut.
