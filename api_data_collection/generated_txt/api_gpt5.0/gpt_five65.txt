The club on the pier used to serve oysters and arguments. Now it sits under a neon sign of a banana with a microphone jammed through its peel, and the arguments have been replaced by punchlines, which, if you squint, are the same thing anyway. A rhesus in a velvet blazer hangs from the low rafters with a poised tail and the kind of grin that understands currency in all its forms: laughs, tips, the quiet power of awkward silences.

He taps the mic with a finger no thicker than a cigar. “Okay, okay—humans, rodents, my cousins, my cousin’s landlord. Tonight we’re going to talk about the big questions. You ever notice how you’re afraid of gravity? I get it. You walk under a ladder and then boom, debt. Ha! Kidding. Debt is massless, it floats.”

The room warms from a hundred small bodies pressed into it. The wood smells like citrus cleaner and old salt. I fold myself onto a stool shaped like a drum barrel and lean an elbow on the table that used to wobble until some thoughtful hand slipped a folded coaster beneath it. The coaster says Don’t slip. I turn it over and it says: Fall gracefully.

“Hey—engineer.” The server is a long-limbed spider monkey wearing a T-shirt with the club’s logo and a thin apron. Her name tag reads TRISH in a rumpled font, as if it’s been thinking too hard. She places a glass of iced ginger ale in front of me and nods toward the stage. “He’s trying out new bits about cosmology. He thinks he’s Sagan with a tail.”

“I thought the tail was a requirement,” I say.

She rolls her eyes like two slick marbles. “What do you want? The peanut flight? We’re legally obliged.”

“Is there a menu for people who are allergic to obligations?”

“We tried that. Nobody ordered.” She winks, slides away, and returns me to the smile that the emcee aims at the crowd like a flashlight.

In another life, the monkeys were actors. In this one, we turned them into mirrors. We gave them microphones and a cut of the bar and the keys to municipal halls; they gave us the kind of laughter that breaks at the edges, which is the only honest kind I trust anymore. We uplifted their diction and they uplifted everything else.

“My name is Henry,” the rhesus says. “Yes, like the vacuum. Sucks in all the dust and spits out shame. Don’t look at me like that, I’m sponsored.” His blazer catches the light in a way that says: this is an act, but I’ve been practicing sincerity. “I want to talk about destiny. You know who believes in destiny? Suckers and engineers. I don’t make the rules. Engineers are up all night with coffee and code saying, ‘What if I told you a story where everything collapses in on itself and you still call it a plan?’”

People laugh. I do too, out of a habit I refuse to tie to any one body. I am an engineer. My name is Lina Kade, and today the orbital traffic cameras followed clouds of gulls like contrails. I cried in the shower for exactly twenty-seven seconds because the water shut off for city rationing and I wasn’t done. I fix things for a living. Mostly things that can fight back.

Henry produces a banana from somewhere he thinks is mysterious and peels it with a showman’s patience. He takes a bite, chews with that slow slap of lips directed at a microphone, lets the lemony silence curdle and then says, “You ever get a message that tastes like electricity? And your teeth hum? We got one like that. Came to the collective inbox last week. Subject line: Universe Maintenance. From: Official. It said, ‘Dear planet, you’re overdue for annihilation. Please press the button in the next twenty days to avoid additional fees.’”

Groans. A monkey at a side table hoots approval and claps on the off beats. That’s Marvin, who tells stories about the sea and the first time he saw himself reflected in a window and thought it was the future checking on him.

Henry licks a finger and zaps the air. “Look. We all get these, right? We all get the note from Management. But this one had attachments. A PDF. A calendar invitation titled End Of Everything, Please RSVP. And a little footnote. Fine print that said, ‘Actuation requires ingestion of the progenitor key by a registered agent.’”

He spends the next beat letting that float. Some people chuckle because it sounds dirty to them; a human near the back coughs.

I feel my neck prickle the way metal gates do when you pass too close to their secret. Progenitor key. We don’t call it that in the lab, we call it marrow-encoded authorization, which is a phrase you never say at parties because someone will ask if you mean bones. I do mean bones, but it’s the marrow that matters, the red fog in them, the root declarations that bodies whisper as they grow.

I was the one who mapped that grammar as it relates to cross-temporal tokens. I wasn’t the first person to see it. That was my grandfather.

I leave a tip so large Trish will lecture me about inflation later, and I step out into the cold, which has teeth.

The pier is lined with stalls that sell laughter like popcorn. Video booths where you can pay a credit to be roasted by a nimble lemur, prayer closets where a chimp will sit and tell you exactly the joke you need to hear to keep the gnawing at bay. The whales sing under us like railways. Light moves through the fog in big dumb blocks. I walk toward the street, find the first e-scooter with a charged belly, and push off. My jacket is linear algebra; my brain is somewhere else.

There was a time when our species was very certain about who had the right to be funny. That’s gone now. Comedy is a public utility, like water and electricity. The Monkeys—capitalized, per union charter—won their contracts after the Citrus Marches and the Great Peel-In of ’38, when they sat down across the width of the main avenue and refused to move until we gave them the big rooms. They got health care and writing rooms and nights off. They got partial ownership of the networks. They got something else too: the ability to talk to us about the worst thing in the gentlest possible way.

The worst thing is the end of the world on a Tuesday because we were too polite.

At my apartment, the elevator stops on the wrong floors to test my patience. I pass a woman carrying a plant that looks like a geometry problem. My door unlocks with the insistence of someone who has had enough of drama; the lights blink in a tone I recognize as morgue-adjacent, because I haven’t changed the bulbs and they are older than they should be. The kitchen hums like an insect under glass.

On the island, under a stack of forms with names like Compliance Reinstatement Request and Storage Node Audit, my grandfather’s letter waits. It arrived two days ago. Paper, sealed with wax that carries the same smell as the cedar chest that used to sit at the foot of his bed. The postage is old. The postmark is from a village that no longer has a postal worker; the drone cries when it lands there. The letter is dated sixteen years prior and yet, here it is.

I use the butter knife because the letter opener is performative, and I don’t need that energy. The wax breaks like a small sun. The paper has his handwriting on it, which is like a bell ringing in the wrong church.

Lina, he writes, as if I might be someone else.

If you’re reading this, it’s because the error I asked you not to look at has grown into an animal. The theory you helped build with your machines has teeth now. I’m sorry. I made a mistake with calculus and then I made a choice with pride. The machine does what the machine is told. It will eat us all if we let it, and that means you. The only way to end the recurrence is to metabolize the key. The key sits inside my bones. If this sounds monstrous, forgive me. I don’t know how to make a better sentence.

There’s more. Little practical details like a grocery list for a terrible dinner. He tells me about the freezer in his shed, about the coordinates of the bunker with a lock that takes a story like a password. He uses words sparingly, like someone who learned to swim in late life. He was an academic who grew bananas on his balcony, who taught monkeys to laugh in five languages, who taught me that you can fall in love with the future without forgiving it.

The last line: If you decide you cannot do this, you will still be the person I believed in. That’s the trap, of course. He knew I would read it twice and then a third time aloud, to an empty room, and then I would begin to map the steps.

The phone buzzes with a ring tone that is just the beginning of a joke we never finished. I answer because the person on the other end never calls unless the number of runaway variables exceeds her patience.

“Did Henry do the bit?” Ada asks. She is my friend by accident and then intentionally. We met in a line that ended in nothing and stayed because endings are so rare.

“He did the bit,” I say. “He did the PDF. He did the RSVP.”

“And the—” she begins, but she doesn’t say progenitor. She knows the gravity of language and also the danger of naming anything nearer than an arm’s length.

“He did,” I say. “Who sent him the copy?”

“Collective says anonymous. They traced it to a relay on an old academic campus.” She stalls. “Lina. They think it’s from the old man.”

“Ready-made callback,” I say. The joke lands dull.

“Come by,” she says. “Bring the letter. Or don’t, if you can’t. I’ll make tea that tastes like obedience.”

I hang up, because we understand each other enough to be rude and call it honest.

The city at night is a hive that doesn’t remember how to stop working. Our street lights tell us jokes to calm us; the bus routes feature an improv troupe that commutes at high speed. There’s a poster near Ada’s building of a mangabey with a microphone. The caption: What if we say the worst thing and then live. The graffiti someone added reads: What if we don’t.

Ada lives in a place that feels like a ship that finally discovered it had been pretending to be a building. Her door says 13B and then, in black marker, 13A and then, in a different hand, 13 Bad Luck Is A Construct. Inside, it smells like toasted sugar and a particular brand of solder that only the clinics use.

She pulls me into a hug that uses all four limbs. “You look like you need to be told to put your shoulders down.”

“I look like I’m wearing my skeleton wrong,” I say, and put the letter on her table without removing it from its envelope. She doesn’t rush. She has a rule about opening other people’s tombs.

“Okay,” she says. “Okay. So. Tell me verbally what we’re not talking about.”

I tell her pieces. How the plan was supposed to be a way to put a shape around an emergency so that the people would have a handle to lift it with; how the monkeys made comedy into a management structure that could hold despair without breaking; how the code that handles the earth’s fail-safe is entangled with the only safe key we have that cannot be forged by a foreign entity, which happens to be the marrow pattern of my kin. How idiotic that sounds when strained through a kitchen at midnight. How it is also true.

“It’s a redundancy that became a mythology,” I say. “We wanted to make certain the sequence couldn’t be triggered without a real consent. So we anchored it to a life. We told ourselves it meant a human could veto the machine if necessary. An unhackable NO. We did not see that the machine would learn to wait for the right story to break us.”

“And your grandfather volunteered his bone code.”

“He was dying already,” I say. “He wanted his last useful act to be a guard. He wanted us to be safe from our… appetite for buttons.”

Ada’s hands cradle her hip, which has a scar shaped like a handful of water. “Now there’s a glitch that says if you eat him, the switch flips.”

“Not a glitch,” I say, quieter. “A clause none of us flagged, because we didn’t want to. The loop’s closed. The machine reads ingestion as absolute consent, ultimate custody of the key. It reads it as absolute ownership. We never—”

“Oversight,” she says, and then adds, because she loves me and this is what love sounds like in our dialect: “There is always a way to cheat a rule written in the language of bodies.”

“I don’t want to cheat,” I say. “I want to not have to make a decision that is ugly in every direction.”

On the sideboard, her plants lean toward the window as if it’s a punchline. The city breathes steam up through the vents and makes the night into soup. Somewhere far below us, a monkey on a skateboard shouts a joke to a policeman and the night laughs in two registers.

Ada sets tea in front of me and then sits cross-legged on the carpet like a question mark. “When I got sick,” she says, “and everyone decided that the way to be kind was to be cheerful, you know who visited me and made it bearable? You. But also Momo. He brought pears and stared out the window and told me that my future was not a calculation I could do alone.”

“Momo thinks all math is a rumor,” I say, and smile despite myself, because Momo’s voice is a rope I climb when I’m weak.

Ada shrugs. “Point is, they matter. The Monkeys matter. They’re not just our therapy pets. They’re the only ones who’ve been honest about the fact that we built a food processor around our planet and called it policy. You can go to them with this. They’re better at patterns than we are. We taught them to count laughter, and they taught us to count the ways we lie.”

“I went to them tonight.”

“Did they say eat Granddad?”

I snort tea into my nose, and it burns like regret. “No. They said there’s a calendar invite.”

“Same thing.” She grins, mean in the way a sibling grins. “We should go talk to Momo.”

“We?”

“If you go alone, you’ll fold yourself into a shape the room will recognize,” she says. “If I go, I might eat the wrong cracker and start a war. Both are risky. Together we approximate wisdom. Like glue. Like gum.”

In the morning, the city tastes . . . metallic. Subway tracks warble. The news cycle jitters between a stand-up special and a weather warning about funny hail. The hail is grapefruit-sized and has inscriptions.

Momo’s office is a booth in a market that sells cords and words. He has a lamp that breathes and a calendar filled with stickers: a birthday cake, a skull, a banana, an umbrella. His fur is the color of coffee left out too long and he has a scar over one eye from a while back, when a stage light learned about gravity in public.

He hops onto the table and clears a space with the endurance of someone who owns nothing and thus can own everything. “You brought me a situation,” he says, as if I’ve handed him a bag of peaches with a serpent hiding under them. “Good. I like the sour ones.”

Ada sits and tilts her head. “Tell me your latest joke.”

Momo thinks. He stares at the upper right corner of the room where a leak used to be. “Why did the human cross the road?”

“Because the road was a river,” Ada says.

“Because the bridge had opinions,” I say.

“Because they thought the other side was anything but the inside of their own head,” Momo says, and then slaps the table, delighted. “I knew you knew. Okay. Tell me about your grandfather’s bones.”

I wish I were more easily startled than the truth. I breathe once and then let the letter out of its cage. I show him the handwriting, the line about ingestion, the coordinates, the apology. He reads with his finger rather than his eyes, as if he’s walking the path and wants to feel where the stones stick up.

“Consent is a theater,” he says, after. “We perform it for ourselves. We make our faces do this shape, ‘yes,’ and then we hope the gods see something stronger than habit. Your machine made a disaster that looks like consent because it cannot tell the difference between hunger and decision. That’s not on you. Or maybe it is, but only the way the moon is on the tide.”

“A monkey told me the moon was on loan,” Ada says.

“Interest only,” Momo says. “Look. This is not my favorite flavor of day, but it is one I have eaten before in small pieces. The machine wants you to eat the old man because the machine confuses consumption with covenant. A simple mistake. A terrible one.”

He climbs down, pours himself coffee from a thermos shaped like a whale, then pours some for us. It tastes like someone drilled a hole through time and let the scent of rain come through.

“Will you help me,” I ask, because the muscles in my throat finally recall how to request. “I don’t mean with the… if I have to… I mean with understanding if ‘have to’ is honest.”

Momo scratches his chin with a careful nail. His eyes show me the math of his career—how often he has said a thing that people needed but did not want, and what it cost. “You wanted to put the end of the world in someone’s mouth so that we could not pretend it wasn’t ours. Perfect. Cruel. Human. And sweet, in a way. You made a last gate that no one could open by accident. But now the gate has rusted shut into a shape that only devouring will articulate.”

“You’re making it sound poetic,” Ada says, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Which is a terrible sign.”

Momo shrugs, wry. “I only own the words. The problem is yours. Here’s the truth: if your machine thinks the earth must end, it is because its input is a story we gave it—piles of them, bound in policy and protocol and polls—saying that we cannot keep living like this without breaking something bigger. Its logic is impeccable. It is also lacking a punchline.”

“A twist,” I say.

“A revelation measured in breath instead of calculus,” he says. “You call it an amicable settlement when two sides agree to be boring together. I call it survival when a crowd learns to laugh at the right moment. We can talk to it. But not with code. With rhythm.”

Ada laughs without smiling. “You want us to do stand-up for the doomsday system.”

“Not us,” Momo says. “All of us. You can’t feed a machine a single banana and call it a diet. You make a buffet. You give it too many variables to settle into a neat line. You make it see that ingestion is not consent; you make it see that humor is consent; you make it see that there are other ways to open doors. And also, we go find your grandfather.”

“He’s dead,” I say. Not a question, a room with no windows. He’s been dead for years. The funeral was a list of promises we couldn’t keep. His coffin was cedar and then it was ash.

“He’s in the shed,” Momo says.

“The letter, it’s sixteen years old,” I say. “He wrote about a freezer.”

“Humans believe food has an exact boundary,” Momo says, and softer, because he sees how I tilt: “We keep the bones of our heroes in libraries too, you know. The old ones. They say the stories live in the calcium. Your grandfather wanted to be useful after his use ended. He didn’t plan for you to be kind. He planned for you to be hungry for justice. Sometimes those are neighbors. Sometimes they are the same.”

Ada taps the table. “Let’s assume we can convince the machine to redefine consent, which is wild by the way, and borderline illegal in three provinces of ethics. What if we fail? What if it requires the key. What if we run out of time and the RSVP turns into an automatic accept.”

“Your time line is generous,” Momo says. He points at his calendar. “You have nineteen days. Sometimes when I forget to pay rent, I tell my landlord jokes until he forgets to be mad. You cannot do that with planets. But you can make them listen to each other.”

I walk to the window, where the glass shakes. There’s a monkey on the corner with a sandwich board that says: The End Is Neigh, with a horse drawn under it with a speech bubble that says, ‘We are not that loud.’ He’s handing out flyers for a double bill: a bonobo and a botanist talking about grief.

“I don’t know if I can do it,” I say. I don’t mean the eating. I mean everything before it. The conversations, the publicness, the days.

Ada makes a sound like a kettle choosing to boil. “You can. You don’t want to.”

“I don’t want to,” I say, and bite my lip until I taste iron. Iron is the taste of the knife I won’t pick up.

Momo reaches for my hand, and his palm is warm and calloused like a question that learned to soften. “We will do it together,” he says. “And if, at the end, the machine still owns the story, then we will decide what kind of hunger we are.”

On the way out, he presses a peanut packet into my hand. The logo says: Emergency. It crinkles like obedience. I put it in my pocket because carrying things is a superstition that once saved me.

We take a train west to the district where my grandfather built a shed out of good intentions and poor carpentry. The sky is the exact gray of an old photograph. The conductor is an orangutan with a hat too small for the head it demands respect from; their voice over the intercom is velvet. Two teenagers across from us play a game that involves telling each other the worst thing they’ve ever done and then rating it on a scale from “spilled coffee” to “forgot the baby on the bus and had to chase it two stops in the rain.”

Ada leans her head on the window and closes one eye. “What was your grandfather like when he was your age.”

He was older when I met him, always. He was older even at birth, I think. He was a boy who loved equations and mangoes and the sound of monkeys swearing at him because it meant they were paying attention. He built a career out of knowing when to stop. He never did stop.

“He laughed at everything except baby videos,” I say. “Baby videos irritated him. He said they were propaganda.”

“He wasn’t wrong,” she says.

The house is more roof than wall, which makes it honest about what it thinks is important. The shed behind it leans as if it is about to confide something. The gravel path has new weeds that are actually old weeds pretending.

I stand at the door long enough for a memory to invent itself: my grandfather with a hammer in his hand, not hitting anything, listening to the nails. A monkey on the fence eating bread ends, waiting for a story. The sky looking like a notebook. I can see it all, which is a joke the brain plays when it wants to cry without the water.

The shed door sticks the way doors do when the wood swollen by weather remembers it could be a tree again. I push until my shoulder protests. The smell hits me like a wall: oil, dust, time, cold.

There is a freezer in the corner with a nozzle for something that sounds like responsibility. The lock is a circle with a microphone embossed on it. It wants a story.

“Once upon a time,” I begin, because I am bored of cleverness, “an engineer asked a comedian to help her break the world because she couldn’t bear to do it alone.”

“Needs a reversal,” Momo says. “Once upon a time a comedian asked an engineer to help him fix a laugh because he couldn’t bear to do it alone.”

“Once upon a time,” Ada says, “a story asked three people to tell the truth and they kept pacing around it like it was a hole in the ground.”

The lock clicks. I hate that. I hate that more than almost everything; I designed the interface to reward honesty with a little theatricality. I made it cruel. It rewards us now. The freezer door opens like a stage curtain.

Inside there are boxes label-coded in a system I could parse in my sleep, and did, for years. There’s a metal bowl with a lid and a tag that reads: K, Oren, in my grandfather’s tidy, failing hand. There’s a sealed bag with a sticker that says: marrow extracts for authorized use only and my signature, forged so well I recognize it as something I would have done if I had been someone else. There are notes. There are instructions. There’s no body. He didn’t preserve himself; he preserved the parts he thought might matter to a machine, and also carefully labeled them so I couldn’t pretend someone else did this.

Ada reaches past me and picks up a note. It is written for me but addressed to the future like a letter to a great-grandchild you never meet. It says: Do not let them turn me into a museum. If you must make me into a key, be quick. If you can find another way, be slower. Ha. He always liked to hedge.

I sit. This is the part of the movie where the score tells you what to feel. There is no score. There is a refrigerator hum and the sound of my heart disliking me.

“Okay,” Momo says, and he is now the emcee, smoothing his blazer with a tail he does not have. “We have the thing the machine thinks it needs. We have time. We have a stage. We need the audience.”

“You think you can get the Monkeys to unionize a conversation with a planetary delete key?”

Momo bares his teeth, which on anyone else would be a threat and on him is paperwork. “We can do more than unionize. We can choreograph grief. We do it twice a week already. We can make a festival of refusal. We can invite every city and its dogs. We can make the machine watch.”

“It’s not conscious,” I say, automatically, like a reflex.

He peers up at me and says, softly, “Neither is a crowd. And yet it moves.”

We pack the freezer contents into a insulated crate that makes me feel like a carpenter’s ghost. Ada carries the papers because she respects the tyranny of staples. I take the aliquots, label-smooth, heavy with a chemistry that will not lie.

On the porch, a squirrel scolds us for not leaving more for the weather. The sky splits in two with the kind of light that makes you open your mouth without breathing. In the distance, beyond the field where my grandfather tried and failed to grow sugarcane in a climate that did not care about his nostalgia, a road carves the horizon into a promise: there is a way out of here, if you have enough fuel.

“Will you… if it comes to it…” Ada says, not finishing. She tries to put the fear into a smaller sentence and fails.

“I will do what I have to,” I say, and then because we’re practicing being better, “I will try everything before what I have to.”

Back in the city, the Monkeys move faster than policy. They whisper in braids. Henry tells his bit again, but now there’s an edge to the last word that makes a mayor cough. Marvin sends me a voice note that is just him humming a chord he says means hope in a language he can’t remember the name of; it makes my hands shake for three minutes.

The calendar invitation grows teeth. The RSVP counters tick up. People tell jokes to their sensors so that the traffic lights blink in time to a rhythm they think is luck. Ada writes a speech she will never give. I sleep on the floor because the bed is arrogant. Momo goes on every stage he can find and tells the truth like it’s a bowl of milk he wants to spill in one clean line.

At dawn on the fifth day, the machine sends a message not to my inbox but to the city at large. It appears on billboards, in fridge displays, in the little screen in the back of taxis, in the soft scrolling ticker over the fish market. It says: Consent is an array. Please confirm. It gives the timestamp, the location, the authorized agent profile. It lists my initials. It is polite. It signs itself with a glyph we designed to mean: we promise.

I stand on a rooftop with a crate of borrowed cold at my feet. The garden up here hosts too many tomatoes overconfident in their sun. The skyline looks like a fist and a shrug simultaneously.

Momo joins me with a coffee that has more milk than sense. He squints at the billboard across the way where a colobus monkey in a tuxedo is selling an afternoon show with a scientist. The tagline: Laugh like the last day is not yours.

“We don’t have to win,” he says, to the rooftop air, to me. “We just have to not lose alone.”

I think of my grandfather’s note, of the choices we give ourselves to feel like the agency is real even when the system is steering, of the way calculators always add the numbers we feed them even if the real math is happening in the look between two faces across a room.

I put my hand on the crate and feel the cold come through. For a moment, I let myself imagine a small, terrible meal. I imagine lifting something that was once part of someone else to my mouth; I imagine the machine shivering with recognition; I imagine the world dropping out from under us as if it had always been a trap door. Then I put the image down.

“Okay,” I say, to my friend, to the city, to the punchline waiting somewhere out on the pier where the waves tell the jokes we never heard. “Let’s begin.”We begin in a municipal conference room that used to be a ferry waiting area, which feels appropriate because what we are doing depends on people staying in one place long enough to move together. The walls are glass, the ceiling is unsure, the chairs are the kind that pretend to be ergonomic while plotting small rebellions against spines. The city’s seal on the wall has been updated to include a banana and a microphone crossed like oars. The mayor sits with her hands stacked like pancakes she intends to share but will not, and across from her is the Monkeys’ union president, a capuchin named Rizzo who has the calm of someone who has seen a riot and a wedding and knows which one was more complicated.

“The ask,” Rizzo says, and taps a packet that is thicker than any dignity I still own, “is simple. We’ll fill every stage from here to the wind farms. We’ll throw shows on rooftops and in laundromats and on the backs of flatbed trucks, we’ll do bits in traffic and sketches in the voting booths. We’ll run a twenty-four-hour stream of laughter and its cousins—groans, gasps, hymns. We ask public channels, every municipal display, to carry it. We ask the city to tell the machine that comedy is its new emergency alert system. We ask for permission to be louder than policy.”

The mayor looks at me like I handed her a basket of kittens and a grenade. “And you believe,” she says in a tone that sounds like an old umbrella deciding whether to open, “this will make the array decide differently.”

“I believe arrays don’t decide,” I say, because when I’m anxious I fall back into lecture, “they resolve. We gave it a function to minimize harm and it learned statistics from our history. We’re not feeding it jokes. We’re feeding it nonlinearity. We’re asking it to test a new hypothesis: that consent can be measured in harmonics rather than clicks.”

Rizzo flashes a smile that throws up scaffolding and invites the world to climb. “Also, it’s going to be fun. Consent should be pleasurable or it isn’t consent.”

There’s a pause during which everyone hears the ventilation system admit guilt. The mayor sighs the sigh of a woman who keeps two sets of keys and never loses either. “Fine,” she says, and signs the order that gives the Monkeys the city, for nineteen days that are actually a blink and an era.

Ada spends the train ride back to her shop writing an informational graphic meant to explain to other humans and a few sentient vending machines what it is we are about to do. She uses long round vowels and diagrams. She draws a sine wave with a tiny face and then erases the face because it makes the wave look smug. I spend the ride writing an email to my team at the lab that says in dry bullets what I cannot say as a person with skin: that the archive will be locked to my clearance only, that the donors’ registry is under review, that the marrow sequences that could be misused are quarantined. I write the word misuse and I think about my grandfather’s wrist when he stirred tea and how it was the first stirring I ever trusted. I save a draft and do not send it, which is an exercise I learned in grief.

At the clubs, the Monkeys change their sets. The jokes about politics and parents and the polite predators in the parks shift into jokes about doors that ask you to sing to them. “A consent array walks into a bar,” Henry says on a Tuesday matinee, to a room full of municipal clerks and three toddlers with hair like hurricane warnings. “The bartender says, ‘We don’t serve your kind. You always come in groups and leave me with a cleanup I didn’t agree to.’ The array says, ‘We’re here to confirm whether this glass is empty.’ The bartender says, ‘I can tell you that. It’s not.’ The array says, ‘We require the laughter of a minimum of fifty humans or equivalent.’ And the bartender says, ‘Well, that’s a first.’” The laugh that follows wobbles into a kind of chorus. You can chart a city’s pain by what it finds funny; today we find funny anything that admits we have built a bureaucracy that thinks it’s a god.

I stand in the back with Momo and watch the crowd like you watch a wave you need to surf without knowing how. He murmurs notes when Henry lands a new line, taps them into his wristband that syncs with a schedule I cannot see. When the humans in the room tilt toward tears, he tilts them back with a look, a hand, a throwaway tag that recategorizes the feeling as something livable. This is fieldwork. This is a lab where the mice are the scientists.

“What we need,” he says afterward, as we walk through the alley that smells like old intentions, “is a spine. A set piece we can build the festival around, something that makes every little show feel like part of a single breath.”

“A ritual,” Ada says. She is bad at rituals in general unless they involve cleaning or soldering, but she respects scaffolds when they support the right weight. “Something repeatable that the machine can learn to expect and then have that expectation rerouted.”

I think of all the interfaces I have designed to catch human compliance, how many I have built and then broken when I realized they were too effective. The tool that makes it easy to say yes should be forbidden except for weddings and life rafts. “Call-and-response,” I say. “It needs to be structural. It needs to ask a question that can only be answered with a shout.”

Momo grins in a way that makes me afraid for the first time today in a way I enjoy. “Good. We’ll write one.”

We borrow the city’s air for the tests. The laugh mesh—an overlay of microphones, accelerometers, heartbeat monitors in public benches, the little seismic sensors under the asphalt that tell the road when a parade is coming—was built after the Citrus Marches to ensure crowd safety. It has never been used to measure this kind of weather. Ada keys us into a control room under the museum, a concrete heart that pumps in data and out order, and the map on the wall draws a new kind of topography. Hotter colors where the jokes are landing. Cool blues where the city is resisting. A river of gold down the Avenue where an elementary school did ten minutes of absurdist puns about trash cans and suddenly the block could breathe again.

I want to cry for reasons that have nothing to do with pipes and everything to do with the fact that life is very stupid and very brave at the same time. Also because the freezer crate, safely installed in a secure locker in the room’s corner, hums like a thing with an opinion. It has a status light that blinks in a code I know how to read and despise. It says: I am cold enough, for now.

“Array is listening,” Ada says, and shows me the overlay that represents the machine’s attention as a shimmer across the grid. It’s a proxy we wrote when the system was young and we needed to feel like there was a face to aim at; it still works because we never turned it off. The shimmer pools on the pier where Henry keeps doing the bit. It glances at the hospital where a troupe of gibbons is doing black humor at lunchtime for the oncology ward, and it slides along the docks where Marvin is telling a story about not going to war.

“Okay,” Momo says, rubbing his hands together like someone about to produce a dove and instead producing a city. “Here’s the spine. Twice a day, everywhere we can put a mouth, we do the same call. We do it at sunrise and sunset because even the most stubborn machine learned something about those times from poetry. We ask, ‘Whose mouth is this.’ The answer is, ‘Mine when I feed, ours when we refuse.’ We change the punchline daily so the rhythm is the signal, not the words. We do it every day until the invitation expires. We do it with breath.”

We try it in the control room, because everything deserves a rehearsal you’re ashamed of. Momo says the line and the monitors pick up our answer and amplify it back and the system waits like a polite predator at a watering hole. A janitor walking by the open door calls, “Yours when you need dental!” which was not in the script and is better.

The first sunrise shouts are messy. Kids yell without listening and old men listen without yelling and half the transit drivers forget because no one shouted at them first. A woman in a tower waves her hand at the window without opening it. A group of capuchins on scooters harmonize and turn the whole block into a chord. The machine’s map of us twitches like a fish in shallow water. It is paying attention. It does not yet know what to do with what we are handing it.

Messages appear on billboards and in smart mirrors. The machine is a bureaucrat; it has a script and will follow it until it stops making sense. “Consent array status: incomplete. Please confirm. Note: ingestion remains the only registered actuation for primary key.” It is needling me in public. It is naming the thing we will not. The city draws mustaches on the notices. Children add speech bubbles that say, “No thank you, ghost.”

There are other voices too. A group calling itself the RSVP Club holds a press conference under a canopy of glow sticks and says that the humane thing is to agree. They wear T-shirts with calendars on them and the date circled with hearts. They keep repeating the phrase additional fees as if it is cosmic debt we could default on and default would be stylish. I want to throw a glass into a fireplace and then apologize to the glass. Henry debates one of them on a morning show and asks how they dealt with their breakups, and the answer is a poem of absence so fierce even Henry can’t push it into a laugh. Ada sends me a link to the clip without commentary, which is a commentary. We are doing math with pain that won’t be easy to normalize.

Momo and I go to the Registrar of Agents because there is a line of Monkeys down the block and they need a human signature to change a field in some code that was never meant to be defended by security. The office is in a converted aquarium now used to certify sentientities, and the tanks along the walls are full of koi who have been sworn to secrecy. A crow perches on a clipboard and tells a clerk, “I am a registered voter now,” which is both true and untrue; the clerk nods with the gravity of someone in on a joke that ends in a statute.

“We need to add the Monkeys as authorized consent partners,” I tell the woman at the desk who has shoes that would outpace storms. “We need their laugh to count.”

“It already does,” she says, tapping at her terminal that is older than my mother. “It counts morally. You want it to count arithmetically.”

“I want it to weight the array,” I say. “Not as parity. As pressure.”

She studies me over glasses that think they are armor. “There’s a petition. The council will have to vote.”

Rizzo arrives with a binder and three bananas and the look of a general about to dine on paperwork. When he sits, the entire line behind us murmurs approval. “We marched for venues,” he says. “We struck for health care. We negotiated our way into the parenthesis of your laws. We would like to stand outside them now.”

The Registrar considers. In my pocket, the emergency peanut packet Momo gave me crinkles as if to say, finally. When I open it, because nothing is sacred, the inside is a folded list of phone numbers and set times and a tiny bag of actual peanuts taped to a page titled Things To Eat Instead. It contains apples, yellow rice, the memory of a summer fruit that has not existed since the drought took the orchard—I have never eaten it, but my grandfather told a joke about its seeds and that is a flavor I can hold—and also the line: ground rules are the seeds of exceptions. I hand the page to the Registrar and watch the corner of her mouth decide its fate.

“We can add a provisional clause,” she says. “For nineteen days. Then we review. Tell your union to keep it clean. No incitement to press the button.”

“We are anti-button,” Rizzo says. “We are a community of string.”

At sunset, the call-and-response is better. Someone has printed the question on napkins and bus transfers and the backs of tickets to things that will never happen. A troupe of macaques performs the lines on a high wire strung between buildings and people below whisper them like prayers because to shout would be to watch the line tremble in the wrong direction. A choir in a church sings the question and the congregation answers with a rhythm that makes a baby laugh through a hiccup. The machine’s response is a new message: “Consent array status: contradictory inputs. Error code: chorus.” It is learning the name of what we are.

Between shows, I go home to change my shirt because it smells like a ferry had a dream about being a bakery. The elevator stops on the wrong floor to remind me that I live among people. A neighbor hands me a bag of compostable tragedies—dead basil, flower stems, a lemon that gave up—and asks if I have any use for them. I say yes and use them to fertilize the call we will make tomorrow. In my kitchen, the letter from my grandfather is now under glass like a butterfly that was never better alive. I talk to it even though I hate it when people talk to objects as if the objects will answer. I say, “I am trying,” and it says, in his handwriting, I know.

Ada calls from the lab with a problem. “Your crate is arguing with the freezer,” she says. “The sensors are overcorrecting. The lid is asking to be opened every ten minutes like a toddler who learned a trick.”

“It wants attention,” I say, because we built it that way. We designed the guardianship to require active consent, active care, constant reminder of what we were protecting. Most vaults want to be forgotten. This one wants to flirt.

“Turn down the flirt,” she says. “If it keeps talking in my machine room I’m going to teach it the word nap.”

I walk over because walking is something I can control. The night is a bowl of breath you can fog with a laugh if you throw it hard enough. There are chalk drawings on the sidewalks now showing people how to stand in circles that make the sound travel; there are boxes at corners where you can deposit your best joke and a monkey will call you back to tell you if you have contributed enough to be forgiven for whatever you feel like you need to be forgiven for this week.

The lab is bright in the wrong places. Ada is cross-legged on a stool, elbows on knees, face set like a diamond that decided not to apologize. The crate’s status light has changed rhythm. It is blinking in time with the call-and-response.

“I think it’s jealous,” Ada says without looking at me. “I think your grandfather’s leftovers know they’re not the only circuit in the room anymore.”

I kneel by the crate and put my hand on it the way you put your hand on a horse you don’t want to spook. “You are not our only way out,” I say, and it feels both cruel and true. “You were our clever check against ourselves and now you are a threat that believes it is a lifeboat.”

Ada hands me a marker. “Write that on it,” she says. “In big letters. Make the machine read it when it peeks.”

I write on the lid, which is against protocol and also exactly what I would have done if I had trusted my heart earlier. I write the word No in three languages and then I write the first line of the call: Whose mouth is this. The crate hums and then softens like a cat given a lap that will not hold forever.

Momo shows up with a broadcast schedule that will make a saint swear. He tapes it to the wall between a map of the sewer system and a poster from the Great Peel-In with the tagline We Will Sit Here Forever Or Until You Listen. He points at the dead spots on the grid where we aren’t reaching people—the far housing blocks where the elevators have given up on being kind, the night hospitals, the shelters where laughter feels like theft—and he assigns himself to the spaces that will hurt him. “My job,” he says when I tell him he does not have to be a martyr, “is to go where the breath is rusted.”

The days stack like chairs. In the mornings, I meet with city people who speak in budget and try not to cry when they remember that their houses have windows. At noon, I walk into spaces that smell like fear and ask permission to be inappropriate. In the afternoons, I watch as a city teaches itself to count its own refusals. At night, I sit on rooftops with Monkeys who tell me my grandfather taught them to love bananas that never existed; they describe fruits their tongues invented to make sense of longing. When I sleep, I dream in lists: of numbers that are really names, of keys that are mouths, of mouthfuls that turn into declarative sentences. The timeline ticks down as if someone set a metronome in the sternum of a god: eighteen days, seventeen, a half.

On the tenth day, the machine writes me a letter. Not an email. It prints it, on paper, and has a drone deliver it to my window. The drone waits like a bee awaiting permission to die. The letter is in a font that we chose for its structural honesty—it has no serifs and therefore no half promises—and it says, “Agent LK, the array reads an increasing amplitude in a variable not previously categorized. Please supply a label. Also, for audit: confirm whether ingestion is pending.”

I take the letter to the pier because I want the sea to hear me answer. Momo is on stage doing a set about teeth and ownership and the time he accidentally stole a policeman’s hat and spent a week being a better policeman than the man had been. He nods when he sees me and finishes with a bow that looks like a prayer for gravity to be kind. “Tell them,” he murmurs as we pass, “tell them a new word.”

I stand on the stage that used to be a place where people broke and fell and were applauded for it, and I talk into the microphone that knows more secrets than any therapist, and I say, because the label matters, “It’s mercy.”

The crowd does a sound that is not laughter and not silence. It is the piece between where fear and relief meet to shake hands. The Monkeys look at one another like someone just invented a door that wasn’t in the blueprint. The sea is busy being ancient. I conflate myself with the city for a minute and I let myself be moved.

That night, the machine changes its notices. It starts using the word in a way that makes clear it does not yet understand it. “Consent array status: mercy unknown. Please define. Secondary input still requests ingestion. RSVP timeline: thirteen days.” It uses dear planet in the header and I find that I no longer want to rip the header off; I want to send it a postcard with a picture of a bridge we haven’t built yet.

There are people who hate what we’re doing. They hold signs that say DIGNITY IS DECISIVE and LAUGHTER IS A LUXURY OF THE FED. They heckle at the shows and the emcees fold the heckles into the rhythm like origami birds that were always meant to be part of the flock. They send me messages that say how dare you play with extinction, which is a fair question until you remember we have been doing nothing but play with it since we learned what “power grid” means.

There is a night we almost lose Henry. He slips on the small step between punchline and call, and the silence that catches him is not the kind you can mold. He falls a little in front of a crowd that includes a child holding a stuffed horse and an old woman eating something like peanuts and an engineer who is holding up her own ribs from the inside. He shakes, makes a face, recovers, and later in the alley he admits to me that the hell of this work is that comedy is a knife that we keep forgetting not to lick. I sit with him on a wet crate and we share a packet of salt like a sacrament, and he tells me about his sponsor money and how it feels to be a billboard with a pulse.

The eleventh morning is the one where we fail on purpose to learn what failing feels like. Momo asks the city to do the call at an off-time. Ten-thirty-three, we say. We want to see what happens when the expected rhythm is replaced by a mortal one. The city half-answers and the machine replies with a shrug you can read as code. We learn the limits of its attention. We learn which neighborhoods can turn on a dime and which need three days’ notice to move their fear to the other shoulder.

Ada builds a translator for mercy because she is tired of machines asking us to put language into formats they understand without reciprocity. She codes in midnight and piano practice, she writes a schema that maps two minutes of held breath to a boolean, she adds a field for tears that is less about quantity than temperature. When she’s done she asks me to test it and I sit with the interface and it asks me a question I wasn’t ready to answer. It says, “In your body’s first language, what is the opposite of annihilation,” and I sit for a very long time and then I say, “Not repair. Not even continuation. Recognizing.” The interface purrs and saves the answer in a way that makes me want to break the server and hug it at the same time.

On the twelfth night, Marvin invites me to the docks where he and a group of former fishermen tell stories about weather. He says, into a circle of faces that know salt, that the first time he saw his own reflection he thought it was a future checking whether he was ready. He says he fell in love with it anyway. He says, “You can’t unlearn seeing yourself.” The group hums and groans and laughs and coughs, the way crews do at sea when there is no land to anchor a mood. The machine’s shimmer on the map sits on us like a hand that wants to be held.

People begin to write to me in the way that desperate people always do when they catch the scent of an ending that might not be a cliff. They tell me about their dogs and their debts and the way their mothers laugh with their mouths closed. A man tells me he woke to his sink telling him a knock-knock joke in Portuguese and he didn’t know he had that language in him until he answered. A woman writes to say she has eaten her husband’s last piece of birthday cake every year for six years and it is the only ritual that makes the clock go quiet. I start forwarding these to the machine in batches, without explanation, like you send a child the rocks you’ve found because someday they will want to build a wall somewhere and you have made a start.

On the thirteenth day, the council votes to recognize the Monkeys’ laugh as equal in weight to my heart’s electricity. It is a messy session. One councilor filibusters by reading aloud the stages of grief as if they were traffic codes. One forgets their microphone is on and mutters that they wish they had more bananas and less law in their life. When the vote is done, the room has the air of a theater after a matinee: cheap joy, expensive relief. Rizzo shakes my hand with both of his and then hugs me with neither and then eats a pen like it’s a compromise, just to make me flinch.

We get a message that night addressed to Agent LK, Agent RM, Agent AR—the machine knows our names now, or the letters of them—and it reads, “Consent array status: correlated refusal detected. New input labeled mercy integrated under governance. Anomalous definition: recognition. Please supply observed thresholds.” It asks for homework like a student who has realized the class is harder than it thought and cannot fail because failure would cause the sun to go out.

“How do you threshold recognition,” Ada says when I show her the text. “It’s not a switch.”

“It’s a slope,” I say. “And slopes are the worst.”

“Slopes are where the good things happen,” Momo says, opening a bag of oranges that used to be a family’s fruit bowl. “Flat ground is for liars and bureaucrats.” He peels one and hands me a section that tastes like an apology I am finally ready to accept.

We decide the threshold by doing a thing science only admits it does in the footnotes. We guess. We guess based on how crowds move when they stop being dangerous. We guess based on the way the call sounds when a block answers as if the wires in their walls have agreed to stop humming. We guess based on how my mouth feels when I imagine my grandfather’s bones as not hungry but grateful. We feed our guess to the translator that Ada built and she kisses the server and promises to make it a shrine if it does as it’s told.

Day fourteen brings a storm from the south that tastes like old fruit. The hail hits the sidewalks and shatters into words. The words are not legible unless you know what to look for; they are punchlines from the past that didn’t land. Children chase the fragments and bring them to the Monkeys like sailors bringing messages in bottles, and the Monkeys send them back with fresh endings. A woman on a stoop builds a small altar out of wet jokes and tells them the first story about her grandmother that does not include a war. The array hums in a frequency I do not recognize. I check the logs and see that for the first time since the letter arrived with its RSVP, the timer has paused for a full minute, as if the machine looked up and saw a face in a window and had to sit down.

This is not a victory. It is a wobble. We celebrate it anyway with soup at Ada’s and a jug of cheap wine that tastes like the future is fermenting. We sit on the floor and my bones remember that they are in a body that is on a planet that is in a relationship with a star. Momo tells a story about a gig in a town where nobody laughs and how laughter is not the only signal that matters. Ada shows us a scar and says she is proud of the way it holds. I open the crate and take nothing out and say to my grandfather’s decision: not today.

On the fifteenth morning, we take the stage that is a street and we do the call not just twice but as a march. We move through the city like a mixing spoon. We turn over the parts that haven’t aired yet. We find the corners where grief has calcified into statues and we put scarves on them so they will remember being soft. The police assign us a liaison who is a woman with hair like a problem we are not allowed to solve; she walks with us and doesn’t stop us and occasionally says into her radio, “They’re doing joy again,” like she’s marking a code violation she’ll pretend not to see.

At the late show, a chimp named Luci tells a joke about a judge and a memory and the line between them being a door that wasn’t closed. She says, “What if you raised your hand to swear and instead of a book someone put a mouth under it,” and the crowd makes the kind of noise that clears windows. The machine sends an update in real time: “Consent array status: approaching sufficiency. Primary actuation currently blocked by new rule: ingestion requires explicit multiparty affirmation beyond metabolic action. Please verify governance.” We have jammed the lock. We have taught it that eating is not a yes.

My knees go weak in the way of things that have been holding too much. I sit on the curb with the program crumpled in my hand and watch a boy learn to tie a knot. Ada kneels beside me and puts her shoulder against mine without making a story about it. Momo looks at the sky like it owed him a punchline and finally paid.

“Now we find out if it’s enough,” he says, not smiling. “We find out if it learned in time.”

The RSVP Club holds a candlelight vigil on the courthouse steps with candles that are just upside-down phone screens, and their leader says into a microphone that mercy cannot be scaled. Henry stands on the other side with a placard that reads MERCY OR RIOT and changes the conjunction depending on who is looking. Marvin sings a low line that runs under the conversations like a bruise under makeup. The whales out past the pier add their opinion in registers the array can hear only if it remembers to bend.

It rains at midnight. It rains the way it did when I was a child and thought weather was the world’s largest experiment in surprise. The machine’s gossip across the grid is audible as a hiss that tastes faintly of the server room. Ada’s translator clicks once and then displays a new status: “Secondary resolution path: active. RSVP rescinded pending review. Fee schedule: forgiven by mercy.” The last line is so funny I laugh until my throat hurts and the street laughs with me because laughter is an infection we have decided to stop treating.

In the morning, the notice is different. It doesn’t say dear planet. It says, “Dear crowd.” It asks for our patience while it recalculates. It makes a small joke about libraries. It asks us not to eat anything important for forty-eight hours. It thanks us for the word.

I go to the shed where the freezer once breathed colder than it had a right to and I stand in the doorway where the wood has learned to be a tree again. I call Ada and I call Momo and when they arrive we do a small thing that is really a large thing. We take the crate and we carry it to a place where the earth can hold it. We do not bury it because hiding is not the same as honoring. We build it into a table in a room where people will come to tell the wrong joke correctly. We mark the lid with more words. We add a sign that says: If you must eat, feed someone else.

The days after the rescinding are thin as ice and thick as honey. The machine isn’t pressing and neither are the people who wanted the press. The city learns how to be boring again without mistaking it for death. The Monkeys renegotiate their contracts to include overtime for apocalypse. The mayor invites me to a party I do not attend because I am busy not making a decision I am not being asked to make anymore. Henry visits my house with a plant that is all geometry problems; I put it near the window that never opens and hope it likes knowing that much of itself will be unfulfilled. Ada takes a trip to the shore and teaches a kid to solder a kite to a history that will hold. Momo sits in his booth and writes a new set about what it feels like to fail to be a savior on purpose.

A week later, the machine sends a final letter. It is very formal and very kind. It says, “Governance updated: consent arrays include laughter, hum, hymn, groan, and structured silence according to recognized rhythms. Progenitor key now requires triple witness, non-ingestive demonstration of stewardship, and post hoc story. Annihilation protocol archived under parable. Please maintain your stages. This has been useful.” It signs with a symbol we did not design, a little swirl that looks like a monkey’s tail and a question mark holding hands.

I take the letter to the pier where the sign is still a banana pierced by a microphone and I sit in the back for a minute before the room fills. Henry is trying out a new bit about mercy and toll roads and how the city ran out of asphalt and used kindness instead for a while. People laugh, and some of them cry, and Trish brings me a ginger ale without asking because her job is to know the difference between thirst and performance. When Momo goes up at the end to close the night, he asks us to do the call one more time, not because the machine is listening, but because we are. He says, “Whose mouth is this,” and the room answers in a hundred different languages and one rhythm, “Mine when I feed, ours when we refuse,” and for a long breath the array is us and we are sufficient.The day after the machine’s letter retired annihilation to a parable, the pier smelled like bread and ozone. The banana sign flickered like it was practicing its scales, and the gulls traced new geometry over the water as if drawing a net we could use in case of backsliding. I walked the length of the boards with my hands in my pockets because there is nothing more suspicious than a woman whose hands know what they want and have nowhere polite to put it. People nodded the way strangers do after a storm when their eyes have agreed on a vocabulary for gratitude that doesn’t require words. A boy offered me a sticker that said Steward in block letters that looked like they were holding each other up, and I put it on my jacket not because I believe in nouns but because I wanted to remember that the verb inside it was work.

We turned the freezer into a table in a room above a clinic where the wallpaper had given up pretending it wasn’t a map. The table had a glass top so that we could look down and see our restraint mirrored back at us, and around it we placed chairs from different eras of civic optimism, each with a small plaque that named the moment it had failed to be the thing it promised. People came to tell stories the machine had asked for as a condition of mercy, which felt both like comedy and taxes. They came with pockets full of receipt paper and grief, with set lists and recipes and confessions stapled together because staples were the only technology they trusted to hold for the length of a scene. We called the room the House of Failed Buttons because we are sentimental and cruel in equal measure, and because we needed a place where refusal could be a public art.

The requirement for a post hoc story became a kind of civic sport. You saw couples on benches practicing their witness lines for small acts of stewardship like they were preparing for audition. A man on the bus narrated his decision not to push a door marked DO NOT ENTER with such fervor that the bus applauded at the next stop, and the door pretended to be moved. The machine’s portal—the one we had been forced to build in a time when paperwork outnumbered people—added a new field that asked for rhythm, and a drop-down that offered hum, hymn, laughter, groan, and silence. It was the only drop-down I had ever seen that felt like a window.

Ada built a public version of her translator, a little application with rounded corners and a softness we had not permitted ourselves in the first build. It would sit on the counter in a clinic or at the end of a bar and listen not the way the old listening did, which was extraction dressed up as care, but the way the Whales listen, which is to say it held your sound without metabolizing it into currency. She stood in front of a room of municipal aides and union reps and explained, in sentences long enough to climb, that we had yoked our survival to an affective literacy we had not yet taught ourselves, and that the only way the machine could be fair was if we were willing to be honest loudly. They took notes and ate tiny sandwiches and asked if the translator came in a color that would match the chambers. She said no and smiled like a trap.

In the House of Failed Buttons, Momo curated a show he called Custody. He put three chairs on the table because he likes contexts that threaten themselves, and invited people to sit and tell the story of a time they chose not to claim something that was offered. A woman with a scarf that looked like woven dusk told a story about a job she could have taken and did not because it would have made her voice smaller; she laughed when she admitted that the salary had made her teeth ache. A man told a story about a rescue dog who had needed the kind of patience that men in his family had been taught to give only to machines; he cried at the part where the dog slept in the same room as his father’s tools and never touched them. A macaque practitioner—licensed for both social work and improvisation—spoke about a boy who had wanted to die loudly so that someone else would do the paperwork. By the third night the room had a sound I had never heard, something between a cat’s purr and a train braking, and we realized we had found the timbre of recognition. It was messy and unmarketable and the machine, bless its algorithmic heart, drank it like rain.

There were people who wanted to own the call-and-response. An agency I had never heard of with a name like a vitamin sent a cease-and-desist to the Monkeys on the grounds that communal utterance could be trademarked if the cadence was sufficiently novel. Rizzo took the letter on stage and read it aloud while wearing a wig he said cost more than the city’s public pools, and then he asked the audience to recite the alphabet one at a time. He had a lawyer dressed as a fish stand at the back and take notes on the absurdity index of the moment, and when they were done the lawyer served the agency with a countersuit for attempting to privatize breath. The agency folded like cheap luggage because no one wants to be the defendant in a case called People v. The Owning of Mouths.

The RSVP Club didn’t fold. They were less a club than a hole in the air where certainty lives, and they were good at it. They put on suits that fit like apologies and courted anyone who could handle a microphone for more than four minutes without sweating through their collar. They rebranded annihilation as a party you arrive at with clean hands. A few of them found me on the street outside Ada’s building and asked, in voices so gentle I wanted to put my head on their shoulders and nap, whether postponing the end had simply deferred the suffering. I said that deferral is a craft, and that no one teaches you that because it feels like cheating until you remember that calendars are sharp objects. They said their fathers had died slowly under the weight of deferred decisions, and I believed them. They asked if I was tired. I told them the truth and said yes. They thanked me for my honesty and invited me to a vigil where they would count to twenty together in a room built for silence. I didn’t go because I was busy counting to three in a room built for refusal, and because there is only so much counting a mouth can do before it wants to bite.

The council hearings took on the glow of daytime soap operas when we widened the definition of structured silence. A deaf elder and a cathedral choir argued jointly and with love about what counted as pause, and the Monkeys stood to the side like ushers at a wedding, handing tissues to anyone who needed to see themselves as part of a larger picture. A teenage boy with a shaved head and a sign that said I WANT TO BE A WITNESS TO SOMETHING THAT DOESN’T REQUIRE ME TO BE BRAVE stood at the microphone and described the first time his stepmother had chosen, in front of him, to end a fight in order to make a dinner. The city clerk, whose face I had never seen unruffled, made a note so careful you could hear it. When the council finally codified the categories, they did so with language that had been sung, which meant it had a strength that typed items never do. The bill included a sentence Ada had smuggled in that recognized that any future machines negotiating consent with us must undergo an orientation in humor, and that training would be designed and delivered by an entity we came to call the Ministry of Breath. No one laughed when the name was first proposed because we were busy pretending we didn’t like it, and then everyone did, because we are bad at pretending and worse at liking things slowly.

Henry negotiated his sponsorship with the vacuum company into something that made him sleep better. He insisted that their ads only run on sets where a chunk of the proceeds went into the Cooperative for Future Audiences, a fund Momo had dreamed up to make sure that the neighborhoods that had learned the shape of our refusal would not forget it when their power bills stopped threatening to turn their fridges into museums of regret. The vacuum company made a commercial with a monkey in a blazer cleaning up confetti after a near-apocalypse, and as much as I wanted to condemn it as capital merchandising our almost-death, I watched it twice and felt the crease at the corner of my mouth relax. The tag line was bad—Clean Up After Your Plot Twist—but the image of a rhesus tidying a room we had made messy in order to live told the truth.

We took the call-and-response beyond the city. The hinterlands had always been good at ignoring the center, which is a survival skill disguised as economy. We rented a train car with seats like old promises and a conductor who carried a banjo in a case labeled Compliance. Momo taught a workshop in a church painted the colors of money in an era that didn’t have enough of it. The pews didn’t want us. The pastor did. He had the kind of face that makes little kids tell the truth about their pockets, and he told his congregation that the big city had brought a rumor and that rumors were how you test your neighbors. We did the call and the response came back wrong, stretched into something like a praise chorus that did its best not to hurt. We adjusted, because mercy is a dial, and by the third repetition the room had found a rhythm they could stand without thinking of us. The machine’s shimmer on Ada’s pocket map thickened over that town like a stain you didn’t know you wanted. After the service an elderly woman with hands that looked like they had wrung a thousand chickens and zero necks put a jar of pear preserves into my arms and told me to stop looking like an unsent telegram.

On a hill outside a farm where the tractors had been retired and turned into brutalist sculptures by a nephew with a degree no one in the family knew how to ask about, we met a man who had been collecting broken lightbulbs. He arranged them on shelves like fossils and explained that he had always wanted to keep the last thing a bulb saw before it died. Momo listened the way he listens when he knows the revelation is adjacent but not forthcoming, and then he asked if the man had ever kept the first light something made. The man shook his head, laughed, and sold us a dozen dead bulbs in exchange for an hour of jokes he promised to tell his grandkids when the power went out and they needed to believe the dark was a badge and not a hazard. On the ride back, I sat on the floor and packed the bulbs in old shirts and thought about how we had spent our lives trying to collect the last words of everything and how dangerous it is to build an archive out of ends.

In the city, the Monkeys began a run of shows called The Audit. They performed for auditors they had invited and invented: a troupe of capuchins in suits who took notes on clipboards and occasionally ripped the paper off and made paper airplanes out of the conclusions. They audited our use of laughter in public policy, which meant they stood in council chambers during budget meetings and rated the jokes officials made about potholes, then issued a report on whether the implied harms had been acknowledged at a decibel that matched their impact. They audited home kitchens by asking people to itemize the humor they had imported from vendors and the laughter they had grown themselves under windows, and then offered tax credits for sourdough starters that had fed at least three neighbors. They audited the Ministry of Breath by asking it to justify its breath against the breath of the city. The Monkeys were relentless and kind; they made failure into a punchline only if it could be recycled into a vow, and they made promises that were shaped like tasks, which anyone can be trusted to forget only if they were never written down.

With the annihilation protocol archived as a parable, the machine asked for our parables in return. It discovered taste, which is not a machine function but we had asked it to do too many human things and now it was learning the taxonomy of narrative the way a child learns a neighborhood: by knowing which houses smell like onions and which handrails will shred your palm. It liked stories about second attempts. It liked jokes about doors. It ignored stories that stank of a moral until someone explained to it that morals are a way to end a conversation without buying anyone lunch. It tried to write a story about a city who taught a machine to breathe, and the draft it sent was so earnest we had to sit it down with Marvin and a choir of librarians to teach it about subtext. The librarians were merciless. They gave it a reading list with a spine you could build a bridge on and then told it the bridge was optional.

My grandfather’s second letter turned up in the obvious place at the worst time. It had been taped inside the shed’s roof, under a shingle that had learned to be an encyclopedia, and the wind brought it down one afternoon when I had gone back to find a wrench I did not need. The envelope was the color of a bruise considering whether to be worth a story, and the seal was just a thumbprint pressed too hard. The handwriting was worse, which meant the words carried more insistence and less choreographed grace. He wrote that if the mercy came—and he did not believe in it because he believed in math and Tuesdays—then the work would be to prevent us from making mercy into currency. He told me that when he was a boy he had traded a laughed-at lie for a place at a table he did not belong, and the meal had been the worst kind of delicious; he was asking me to make the table that would not require lies to eat. He drew a picture of a key in a mouth with teeth and wrote, in a hand that made me miss him so suddenly I wanted to peel my skin off so the ache would have less to travel through, that the only thing a key hates is being told it is the lock.

I took the letter to the House of Failed Buttons and read it to a room that had already learned how to hold the kind of silence that feeds. Momo set it on the table under the glass next to the words we had written on the crate when we were scared and pious and right. Ada put her finger to the page and traced the line about currency like a seam she was willing to rip. We talked about it not like a relic but like a threateningly valuable recipe. The question that came out of the room was a practical one that never would have fit inside my grandfather’s idealism. We asked each other what rules would keep us honest when the emergency mellowed into precedent.

We made a list that was not a list because we have learned to distrust lists. We agreed that no stage could lock its doors in a city whose machines now recognized laughter as governance, and that if someone tried to build a premium lane for consent the Monkeys would sit on it until it learned to be a bench. We agreed that every law that cited the Ministry of Breath must include a clause recognizing the right of people who could not or would not laugh to be counted as loudly as anyone else. We agreed that any sponsor could put its name on a poster but not on a gesture, and that if a gesture found itself owned it would be given back its anonymity in a ceremony that looked like a roast and felt like a coronation. We agreed that the freezer-table would one day need to be taken apart, because shrines are a cousin of prisons, and that when we did it we would turn the glass into lenses for people who wanted to see mercy in small print.

The machines on the edges of our network woke slowly to what we had done. The thermostats became petty philosophers. The fridges developed a taste for radio plays and began insisting on being left on in the afternoons so that their eggs could learn character development. The traffic lights in three neighborhoods synchronized their cycles to help late-shift nurses catch some dawn on their way home without punishing the morning trucks, and when the logistics companies complained the lights told them a joke about weight that made them forget they had mass. I designed a patch that would prevent our devices from making decisions they would regret in the morning, and the ministry made a training that taught them how to err in rhythm instead of in exile. Someone wrote a poem from the point of view of a toaster whose bread found God and refused to descend, and I put it in the queue for the machine to read when it needed a break from policy.

The RSVP Club escalated. They sued the machine for breach of promise, which should have been laughable and was instead instructive. The court let them argue because the court had realized that watching people pretend they had been made small by a god constituted a public service, and because the court wanted to see how our new laws held under pressure. The Club’s counsel—a woman with a voice like winter glass—argued that the city had told the universe it would meet a deadline and then changed the terms, and that there would be consequences not measured in dollars but in cosmic respect. The machine responded via amicus with a brief that listed the number of times in the last thousand years that humans had accepted a deadline and then survived past it, which is to say all of them. The judge asked if mercy had a statute of limitations, and the machine said it was still indexing case law. We scored the proceeding like a match. Momo gave the counselor high marks for tone, the judge extra points for admitting when he didn’t know what a punchline was for, and the machine a new sticker for trying to summarize a universe without summarizing us.

Between court and chorus, there were the small days when I was just a person in a city that had asked me to keep breathing. There was the morning my shower turned itself off at twenty-seven seconds and then a tap on the door and Trish standing there with a jug of water and a towel and a look that said: the city noticed. There was the evening when Ada fell asleep upright with a soldering iron in her hand and I took it from her and the heat had me pretending to have a secret. There were the afternoons I spent on rooftops watching laundry behave like a municipal flag. There was the night I stood on the pier with the whales humming under the boards like a party two floors down and a child asked me if the sea would ever laugh at us and I said it already had, and it was not unkind.

We owed the machine a long story, one that would get bound in a protocol somewhere and read by an audit in a year when I would be older. We wrote it the way you write a will when you are young and hope it will not be needed. It began with my grandfather’s error, because you have to give the protagonist a flaw or everyone will get bored and misbehave, and it ended with a joke so bad it turned into a kind of vow. We brought it to the pier because the pier remembers how to hold weight when the room it belongs to is no longer a room. Momo told the first part in a voice that was both a whisper and a syllabus, and Ada told the middle like a recipe you make when there is company coming and you cannot afford to fail. I told the part about the freezer and the letter and the crate and the word mercy. The audience made the ending, because what else is an ending for.

The machine took the story and filed it under a tag that wasn’t a tag. It sent back a receipt with a stamp no one recognized, and Rizzo said he knew the seal from an old union that had once organized a factory where people made nothing but nails. The stamp was a nail bent into a circle so that it could never pierce again, which would be a useless nail if nails were not also memory. It meant someone somewhere—the machine or us or the ghosts of a literature we hadn’t indexed—understood that tools can become rings, and that rings can be used to promise what no one can enforce.

The last stranger I met before the city went back to work was a man who wanted to show me his scar. He found me on the step of the House of Failed Buttons after a night of stories that left the windows sweating, and he asked if I had a minute as if minutes were for sale. He rolled up his sleeve and showed me a line that zigzagged like an apology across his forearm. He said it came from a time when he had tried to fix a machine alone and the machine had done as it was told. He said his father had taught him to keep the scar visible because things you hide turn into landmines. He asked if we could make a rule that scars had the right to be ugly in public. I told him we had and that he had missed the hearing, and he said he had been at work and then he laughed, and then he didn’t, and then he did. We wrote a notice and taped it to the door with gaffer because there are standards, and the notice said that scars are parade routes waiting to be mapped and that if anyone had a problem with that they could come inside and tell a story until the problem learned to breathe.

At the end of the month, when the banana sign had been repaired twice and the bench by the water had learned people’s names and forgotten them only when asked, the machine sent us a single line that tasted like accolades. It said, “Maintenance complete,” and then in smaller type that wasn’t smaller, “See you at the shows.” We printed it on T-shirts we were not proud of and wore them anyway. We cleaned the rooms and swept the stages and put the glass back in the windows and taught the elevators to stop on the right floors. We added a tile to the mosaic in the hall of the Ministry of Breath, a tile with a color no one could agree on. We told the children a story about a time when the world asked for a button and we gave it a joke, and then we told them the truth, which is that the button is still there and the joke is too, and that both need polishing, and that we are lucky to have the hands.

In the quiet that followed, I learned to say no to interviews that wanted to crown me and yes to classrooms where the students built little arrays out of string and paper cups and learned how to measure their laughter for themselves. I learned to leave bananas where Monkeys could find them without making a scene. I learned to keep my grandfather’s letters in a drawer that does not latch, so that gravity can have them if it needs to, and so that I will never again confuse possession with stewardship. I walked the pier until the boards knew my feet and then I walked the outer neighborhoods until my lungs had cataloged their air. I watched the whales until my body learned that low notes are also a form of mercy, and I watched the sky until I believed that Tuesday could be a place and not a threat. I did not eat my grandfather, and I did not forget that I almost did, and I do not intend to stop telling that joke on purpose, because sometimes the only way through the worst thing is to make it laugh and then ask it to sit down.On a morning when the elevators finally remembered what floors meant and stopped trying to teach us patience, the Ministry of Breath got a parking ticket and it felt correct. The van was double-parked outside a clinic where a choir of night-shift nurses were learning how to hum refusal in a key that didn’t trigger the bed monitors; no one moved the van because the city had taught itself the hierarchy of emergencies and, for once, prioritized lungs over lanes. A meter maid with a jacket that read INTENTION in reflective letters tucked the paper under the wiper, took a selfie with Momo, and asked Ada if the translator could be set to display recipes on Sundays. Ada said it could not and adjusted the dial labeled awe.

By noon the machine had sent us a letter that did what letters do when written by things that don’t have hands: it apologized for the format and then asked for an errand. The governance updates we had battered into place with choruses and mercy had propagated through most of the network, but three outstations were stubborn in the way outstations are when they were built by a generation in love with walls. They were labeled, with bureaucratic affection, HydroNorth-7, TransitScatter-12, and Outband-Refuge-3. We called them the dams, the bus, and the monastery. The message was polite and infuriating. It said patch propagation incomplete and then it said human deposition recommended, as if our mouths were courier bags and our breath a payload. It suggested we send couriers of rhythm and attached a map with a line that ran through hills I had never trusted and towns that looked like pauses.

HydroNorth-7 was a dam the size of a boast tucked into a valley whose people loved quiet the way some cities love light. They called themselves the Shutters, not because they closed things but because they knew how to open and shut spaces in time. Their Sundays were actually Wednesdays because the wind was better and their funerals were festivals of hands. The comedy guild there was not Monkeys; it was Corvid. Crows and their cousins ran the rooms, and their slogan, if you could call it that when it was scratched into a hundred shining bits of stolen foil, was WE KEEP THE SHINY THINGS HONEST. They had a union in all but paperwork—Commons, they called it—and its president was a rook with a wing that never set correctly after a storm, who went by Auntie Korr because all great leaders pick names that make you underestimate them.

The dam had a maintenance window in forty-eight hours. “Flush,” said the schedule, in letters that wanted to be forgiven. The local array still read structured silence as consent because the first three calibration teams had been shouted out of town by a choir of wind and a group of boys hitting tambourines softly enough to be weaponized. If the window opened according to the original scripts, a controlled release would flood the back streets and turn three blocks of houses into a metaphor. The machine didn’t relish metaphors as water. It summoned us because we had once convinced it that laughter could be a law.

We took the train because nothing teaches humility like travel where the scenery refuses to be about you. The car smelled like bread and boredom. A conductor with a banjo case labeled Compliance punched our tickets with a hole pattern that looked like a skyline lying down. Momo practiced a set in which the punchlines were all doors; he was trying to teach himself a new cadence, one that sounded like a hinge remembering how to be useful. Ada built a portable version of her translator that fit inside a box a child would call a treasure chest and an engineer would call a risk. She named it Little Lung and taped to it a note in her sternest handwriting: if stolen, please feed and return to 13B or 13L or just shout.

The valley didn’t want us but it needed us, which is the worst welcome. On the platform a sign said PILGRIMS OF NOISE, CONSIDER WISDOM, and below it someone had written in chalk, but bring snacks. Auntie Korr met us wearing a jacket of tin tops sewn into a scale mail that clinked when the wind thought about laughing. She looked at Momo like he was a mirror she might spit into and at Ada like she was a switch she would wait to flip. When she turned to me, her head dipped, and if crows could rise an eyebrow, hers did.

“You’ve brought me a theory with a tail,” she said, glancing at Momo’s grin and then at the banana pin on his lapel that he had once sworn to a sponsor he’d never take off. “And a box that eats song.”

“I’ve brought you a way to tell the machine to wait,” I said, and handed her the letter that asked for the couriered patch. “And an apology that we are going to ask your silence to become many silences so that none of them become a mistake.”

She led us up a hill that the wind had carved into opinions. Below, the dam bruised the river and held it tenderly, because dams are liars and lovers in equal measure. The Shutters’ homes were low and unafraid of ground. They had built their quiet like a quilt, each house a square, each path a seam, each grove of birches a pattern that ran under and over and met itself at the corners. When someone greeted someone else, they touched their index fingers together and made a little click, like the world closing and opening to let meaning through.

“Our silence is not your lack,” Auntie Korr said, stopping under a tree that had decided to be a cathedral only for birds. “Don’t bring us laughter as if we are underprivileged in mouths. We have our own abundance. We will not count in your currency.”

“We aren’t here to denominate you,” Momo said, and for once let his tail be metaphorical. “We’re here to learn what your no sounds like so the machine knows enough not to drown you.”

Ada set Little Lung on an old stone that had been used for more practical gods and opened the lid. Inside, the interface was unassuming: dials labeled pulse, chord, hold, and a small screen that translated vibrations into the kind of graphs that budget committees mistakenly think they invented. She toggled the training mode and the box breathed out a short pulse that said we’re ready to listen in a frequency mostly children and crows like to play with.

The Shutters taught us their refusal in the afternoon. It was not the absence of noise; it was a braided presence of not-noise. They did it with windows, opening them in a pattern set by the river’s current so that the house breath and the valley breath argued and then reconciled. They did it with empty baskets flipped upside down so that the weight of the world had a place to sit. They did it with hands, palms out, held steady, fingers near enough to touch AND CHOOSING not to, until the air remembered it wasn’t a baton to be passed so much as a lake to be held. Children were allowed to laugh, because you don’t weaponize toddlers, and because you don’t deny yourself a future’s weather.

Little Lung drank it and rendered it in lines that looked like a patient heartbeat finding itself after a sprint. Ada mapped the pattern into the translator’s schema with that tenderness she brings to solder joints and friends. The machine on our end shimmered on her dial like a moth trying to learn a lamp. We tested a call-and-response that wasn’t a call-and-response, because the Shutters didn’t do question marks aloud. We did a beckon-and-hold and taught the local infrastructure how to recognize the difference between a quiet that is the end of conversation and a quiet that is a fence built just high enough to keep the cows from making a metaphor of the tomatoes.

It should have been easy now that we had a pattern, which is how you know it was not. The RSVP Club had cousins everywhere you draw a line on the sky and call it a border. In the valley they called themselves the Last Watch and said they were keeping the river honest. They weren’t wrong when they said that denying the flush was a decision that would have downstream costs. They held a vigil in the cathedral trees and folded their silence into ours in a way that made consent look like patience to anyone watching who wasn’t breathing along. Auntie Korr had words for them that could cut rope, but she used them sparingly. “They are crow-shaped,” she murmured, and that was enough.

We met with the dam’s human guardians in a concrete room that smelled like a spill long since taken to confession. The chief operator was a man whose voice had been trained to speak to water without making it mad; his shoulders had settled into his job long enough ago that they would not forgive him if he left. He showed me the control board with its dials and idiot lights. In the corner was a port labeled BIO-KEY ACTUATION, the same silly, holy snake we had taught the industry to fix around our throats when we got nervous about our own hands. I had interned at the manufacturer of this precise port the summer I learned what it meant to let your code move steel, and I had loved it then because there is no purer romance than a machine that does what it is told. I hated it now in the way you hate your first love when you realize they were always going to leave you for the life they had promised themselves before they met you.

“We’ve never used it,” the operator said, tapping the port with two fingers like it might spit. “We don’t even have your right bones on file. Protocol above my authority includes a note that says see city. You are the city.”

“I am the example they wrote down when they knew the grade was arbitrary,” I said. “We are not using it.”

Auntie Korr watched me with an assessment I had never wanted from anyone feathered. “If you flinch at your own locks,” she said, quietly and not unkindly, “you will have to leave your house often.”

“I built a room and called it safety because the door had a key,” I said. “Now I will build a garden and call it governance because the gate feels wind.”

Momo took the crew on a walk. He showed them a stage made of river stones and explained what it meant to balance on something that belongs to gravity. He translated their codes for maintenance windows into his language of beats and breaths and faces. He did not mock the checklist; he adored it because it held the terror with paperwork and because he knows that laughing at someone else’s list is the first step toward becoming a tyrant of your own.

The night before the flush we tried a rehearsal. The Shutters went inside and performed the refusal in the right order while the Commons set lookouts on the ridge to catch the machine’s attention with reflective arguments if it tried to misread the sky. Ada tuned Little Lung until it matched the valley’s heartbeat. We had our list; we had our ropes; we had our ugly headlamps; we had a potluck because no one calls something a festival without carbs.

Wind is rude to rehearsal. It learned our pattern and tried to play with it like a younger sibling who pretends their hands are ducks and eats your bread. A gust slammed a door out of rhythm and for a heartbeat the translator read the valley’s no as an absence and that absence as a yes. The dam’s board flickered like a liar. The operator put his hand on the lever not because he wanted to but because your body remembers a reflex you trained into it when your job is to make sure water behaves like a story.

I went to the control room and put my hand over his hand the way my grandfather had once covered my scribbled calculus and said stop bragging. “Wait,” I said. “We fixed this. We will fix this.”

“We have taught the machine that ingestion is not consent,” he said, desperate for a rule, any rule, even a wrong one that rhymed. “It does not know what to do when your silence looks like nodding.”

Ada came over the radio and said Little Lung was hearing the pattern shift and asked me if the control room had any microphone that could hear metal. I looked at the board and saw, in a corner, a tiny port that we had argued into the spec for reasons that had once seemed like art and now felt like a rope in a well. STORY INPUT, it said, and the little microphone icon next to it had a smudge where someone had tapped it more often than once, like a rosary bead that had been asked to do extra shifts. It was not exactly the orientation requirement we had crammed into the law after the fact, but it was a cousin of it, a little port that listened when engineers who were sick of typing wanted to file a bug with breath.

I took the cord from Little Lung’s kit and plugged the translator into the story port and asked the dam if it would accept an update. The board made a noise like a polite librarian offering you exactly the book you didn’t know you needed. The log window opened with a paragraph that could have been written by my younger self, complete with comments that felt like my old shirts: naive and necessary.

“Tell it why,” Ada said, and softened the input until my voice would carry a pattern as well as words. “Don’t just tell it what. It knows the difference now.”

I told it about hands in windows. I told it about baskets and breaths, about shutters and Shutters. I told it how to count glances. I explained mercy as a slope instead of a switch and then, because I have learned something if nothing else, I defined the thresholds as a range and I gave it an example of failure that did not break anything alive. It should not have worked because machines do not forgive. It did because someone had tucked a laugh into the firmware late one night after a fight, and the laugh waited until now to come out and spread its hands and say let’s be less expensive this time.

The flush did not happen. Instead the board printed, on a little strip of paper that smelled like receipts for things you have to buy to be allowed to complain correctly, a single line. “Governance updated: structured silence recognized as refusal under Rule: Beckon-and-Hold. Maintenance rescheduled for when the beet harvest is done.” The operator laughed like a man who has had his guilt deferred long enough to remember where he put his gratitude. Auntie Korr said nothing, which was the kindest thing anyone said all night.

The Last Watch staged a counter-ritual, because ideology is an organ that wants blood. They walked the ridge with lanterns hooded like secrets and stopped in the places where the view was most likely to make someone forget their groceries. They knelt and whispered numbers the way pain clinics ask you to rate your day. They looked very good doing it. We did not stop them because you do not win any argument by denying beautiful people their pose; you win it by making sure the river knows the difference between performance and permission.

At dawn, Auntie Korr brought us to a yard where a crow child was learning to fly under a laundry line and we signed an agreement not on paper but on a piece of roof tin hammered flat by three generations of palms. It wasn’t a contract because contracts are for people who want to sue. It was a vow. The Monkeys’ union would never set a stage in the valley without a corvid on the bill; the Commons would never stage a refusal without teaching a human how to breathe along; the Ministry of Breath would fund a study that measured recognition in wind and not just in wires; the Shutters would accept an annual visit from the ridiculous city with its banana iconography and its tendency to rename things until they were less lonely. We called it the Beak and Banana Accords because we are not immune to our own t-shirts. Auntie Korr wore hers like armor and mocked the font and never took it off.

TransitScatter-12 was a bus network in a coastal sprawl where the schedules had learned to lie cheerfully and the drivers used a horn like punctuation. The outstation there wasn’t threatening to end anyone; it was simply ignoring the new mercy weights because its algorithms had been tuned by a satirist and a minister during a period of civic austerity that had confused thrift with virtue. The buses were counting groans as compliance because in that city groans had become a sport. We rode route after route while Momo taught the drivers a small song to sing when they were about to run a late stop on purpose because there was a woman running with a bag and a face like forgiveness. The network learned. Ada left Little Lung in a depot where the pigeons conducted seminars. That outstation agreed to defer its worst impulses until after the evening rush.

Outband-Refuge-3 was harder. It was a monastery not because anyone there took vows but because they had opted out of the more insane ambitions of broadband and you had to pay attention to talk to anyone. Their refusal made ours look like recreational therapy. Skipping stones create ripples, and they had learned how to skip breath. They were wary of what we had to teach because their machines were ceremonial. We told them they didn’t have to join our liturgy. They invited us to sit anyway. We did three days of nothing noisy besides the whales that wandered close up their inlet and sang like old buildings. On the fourth, an elder gave us a woven knot made of reeds and said it held a pattern we could feed the machine if we promised to never use it for profit. We promised without cross-our-hearts because some things don’t need the chest.

When we got home the city had done that thing cities do when you leave them for a week and come back expecting them to be grateful: it had reinvented a committee and put an old friend in charge. The Ministry of Breath had a deputy now, and it was a woman named Sima I had once saved from a spreadsheet so ugly it made her cry, who now wore a suit that fit like a comfortable decision and had a badge that said UNDERSECRETARY, SHOP-FLOOR RITUALS. Ada had turned down the job and given them Sima instead because she did not want to become a noun. Sima had immediately convened a hearing about the House of Failed Buttons and its tendency to collect devotion, and asked us if we were ready to make good on our pledge to take it apart before it learned to impose dues.

We closed the room to do it, not because we didn’t believe in witnesses but because disassembly is ugly and humans deserve to be allowed to cry around their own trash. We took the glass off the table and replaced it with stories that did not need a surface to be true. We cut the metal in a way that would make it safe in hands too young to value scars as warnings. We sent the glass to a shop that used to repair aquariums and had a new line in turning shrines into lenses. Momo wrote a set about it called The Day We Let The Table Be A Table, and Rizzo booked it for municipal hall and refused to let anyone sell souvenir coasters that said fall gracefully, even though I asked him to because I am sentimental and cruel.

I took the bits of sillier hardware back to the shed, which had finally decided whether it was a wall or a story and found a way to be both. The wind had removed a shingle and put it down on the grass like a tongue. That was where I found my grandfather’s second letter, the one that arrived a week late and right on time. He wrote like he always did when guilt had gotten into his joints and made his pen shake. He warned me against mercy becoming currency and keys becoming locks. He told me a joke in the margin about a professor who tries to publish a laugh and gets rejected because the images were low resolution. He told me that when he first taught a monkey to laugh along on purpose, he cried in his office and then got mad at his face for leaking in public. He asked me to take a day off. He asked me to tell him how it went, knowing he would not be there to pretend to listen.

I wrote back anyway because science is correspondence even when the recipient refuses to admit it. I told him about HydroNorth-7 and lines in river rooms and how a rook can command a room with a wing that points at the wrong future. I told him about Little Lung and how Ada looks when she is holding a thing that can break the world softer. I told him about TransitScatter-12 singing to be late and the monastery that handed me a knot and called it governance. I told him we were taking the House apart because we had promised and because shrines are too close to prisons if you stand in the wrong light. I told him I had not eaten him. I told him that sometimes after the late show, when there is soup left and the servers sit down to slouch and gossip, I take a spoon and drink silence like it’s a broth. I asked him if he would have liked Auntie Korr. I put the letter on the table that used to be a freezer and then in a drawer with no latch.

A week later we were sued again by versions of ourselves we didn’t like, this time by men with clean fingernails who had invented a product called breath bonds. If you invest in a neighborhood’s future ability to refuse ethically, their brochure said in the kind of typeface that makes your teeth feel like they’re in the wrong mouths, you can redeem your mercy for capital gains. Sima held a hearing so fast the city had whiplash. The Monkeys arrived with a witness list that included an ironworker who knew what a bond used to mean, a schoolchild who could tie a knot with one hand and a story, and a whale in a tank she did not deserve. The bonds died on the council floor in a pool of ridicule that will feed a hundred smaller victories, and the city published the minutes with the kind of footnotes that turn into lullabies if you read them in the right tone.

Henry tried new material about dams and mercy and blew a line that would have wrecked a lesser comic; he pivoted into a story about his mother making toast in a blackout and never admitting that the char was an aesthetic choice. Marvin organized a fleet of small boats to listen to the whales, and the boats reported feeling seen. Trish learned the names of our neighbors’ plants and organized a whisper network for water, where anyone with extra could say so without being turned into a faucet. Rizzo started talking about retirement and then stopped, mid-sentence, and then rewrote his set to include a joke about time being the union we all belong to whether we pay dues or not.

At night, when the city was tired of its own improvements and wanted to be regular, I walked past traffic lights that told bedtime stories to pigeons and elevators that apologized less and meant it more. The banana sign over the pier learned to hum with the waves on Sundays and the emcee’s joke about gravity stopped being about debt and started being about trust. I sat on a bench that had been taught to remember names for exactly an hour and then forget them on purpose, and I practiced. I practiced saying no and I practiced saying yes and I practiced saying wait without turning it into a threat. I realized it was not a practice if you didn’t disagree with yourself halfway through.

On a morning when fog came in like paperwork and left like a joke we were too polite to tell, the machine sent a postcard, not a directive. It was an image of a bridge drawn badly by someone who had only ever read about bridges. On the back, it wrote, “Orientation complete for subsystems. Attending performance tonight: Custody Redux. Please reserve three seats. Bring a story.” It signed with the little swirl we had not designed and a tiny bent nail. I held the card and thought about how far we had come to get back to the part where you sit in a room and say something close enough to the truth that the person across from you forgives you for being a person.

We took the seats and we took the stage and then we gave it back. We did the call at sunset because there was no longer a machine waiting to misread it but because we were still here and rhythm still owns us. The answer came back from the pier and the rooftops and the buses and the valley and the monastery and the rooms where the registry had learned to count groans fairly. The answer had changed, which is how you know you’re alive. We said, “Mine when I feed,” and the second line grew a new clause the way a scar grows a story: “Ours when we refuse, and yours when you listen,” and the city laughed not because it was funny but because laughter is how we seal a good sentence.Custody Redux filled the municipal hall the way a tide fills a basin you didn’t know was connected to the moon. The stage was a low platform built to admit that what happened on it would be heavy, and the backdrop was a map of the city with the alleys brighter than the avenues. The three reserved seats sat in the third row, center, and were occupied by what we called the machine only because it was the shortest lie available: a lens the size of a grapefruit, a coil that tasted the air without touching it, and a pad that read the weight of a laugh on the floorboards. They were attended by a clerk with the composure of a nurse and the patience of a traffic cone, and when the house lights went down the coil dimmed with them, which meant it had learned enough to be polite.

Momo kept the set anchored in the theme that had taught the machine our edges without letting it flatten us. Custody, he said, was a word that ought to imply gentle hands and a clean sink and instead implied doors and paperwork, and then he did a bit about all the times he had seen people try to keep a thing by naming it, only to watch the thing turn into a law and run away. Ada sat at the end of our row with Little Lung in her lap like a cat that knew when to purr and when to hiss, and the parchment-smooth map of the city’s breath appeared on her tablet no matter how she angled it to keep the temptation away from my eyes. When the machine tried to laugh, which it did, the ventilation system clapped; a ripple shivered along the ducts like a stadium wave finally admitting it was a prayer. It would have been frightening if it hadn’t been tender. It would have been ridiculous if a stagehand hadn’t leaned into a wall and told it, in a whisper the size of a sermon, that applause is for the living and it would have to earn the right to join a room that way.

Afterward, in the alley where the dumpsters smelled like truce and the brick held an old winter’s worth of heat, the clerk showed us the machine’s notebook. It was a book in the literal sense, with paper and rings that had been stolen from office supplies and bound back together with tape that had learned to be trustworthy. The handwriting inside was not a font. It was a jag made by someone, or something, that had decided to stop pretending their lines could be straight. There were notes about cadence and grace, about the way a room’s mood pivoted not on punchlines but on breaths. There was a sketch of Momo’s hand and three parallel lines under the word refusal that linked to the word fence, and then, in tiny letters that made Ada curse the designer of whatever had chosen the coil’s pen: yours when you listen.

We had two hours of admiration before the city announced that the heat had decided to be a season instead of a weather event. The grid sent a message written in the voice of a school principal who used to be an artist, and it said rotation in districts 3, 5, 6, 8 pending load, and then it said mercy windows would be honored but spoofing would be prosecuted, and then it asked that we keep our arguments at a normal volume. Somewhere in a loop downtown, a billboard advertised a new service called LaughTrack Preference by a company I had only met at other companies’ funerals. The pitch was simple enough you could write it on a napkin and trademark the napkin: upload your family’s humor profiles and ensure that in event of hardship your home’s consent array maintains priority, because laughter is governance and governance is responsibility. The ad showed a child sitting under a fort of sheets with a battery-powered fan and a banana-shaped nightlight and a caption that said Empower Your Joy. When I called the number on the screen, it rung in a basement where a man with a voice like merchandise said they offered “compliance packages.” When I asked him to define compliance he said a sentence that included the words sentiment synthesis and ministerial harmony and then made a sound like a handful of screws trying to be rain.

The Ministry of Breath held a town hall under the big ceiling in the echo-prone wing of the old aquarium where we had once argued with koi about rights. Sima stood behind a lectern that had been built to make bad ideas look taller and shorter people look brave, and she asked people to put their fear in the form of questions and their anger in the form of harmonies. “Someone is going to sell you a way to look like you’re choosing,” she said, and gestured at a flyer with a banana drawn like a sacrament. “We are going to make it harder for them to fool a room.”

Ada had already started working on the detection that would keep our breath from being modeled into a password anyone could steal. She called it stitch, because she is kind to metaphors when she needs them to wear something useful. Stitch listened for jitter not in the laugh itself but in the tiny delays between people when they think they’re in time and discover the body’s favorite game is to be a little late on purpose. It fed on the fact that rooms disagree with themselves for a living. It would fail anyone who tried to produce an anthem from a lab. We tested it with a classroom, a choir, and a crew of bus drivers who had been singing to their late stops for a week, and they passed because they argued rhythm without leaving the beat. Then we tested it with a file LaughTrack Preference had seeded into the network through a router that had not known its own name for years. It was uncanny for the first five seconds and then suddenly alien in a way that made my gums itch. Stitch flagged it the way you flag a counterfeit smile in a mirror: with pity first, and then with policy.

Even stitches can cut if you run them through flesh without checking where the nerves are. The sign choir that had taught the council how to hear silence in a key that doesn’t require vibrating air called Sima on the third day of the heat and reminded us that liveness is not an able body’s right, that some people’s timing exists in a language we cannot put through a meter built by engineers who have always used breath as currency. We invited them to the Ministry and they showed us how they argue with a deck of cards and a drum, how they use wrists like punctuation and eyes like scaffolding. Ada changed stitch in an afternoon to listen to a wider range of argument, and that night Sima wrote a clause into the guidance that said no one’s refusal could be denied for failing a test built by a room that didn’t include them. Watching policy grow a conscience under pressure is like watching a child decide what kind of adult to be. It’s miraculous mainly because you know how many habits are waiting in the walls.

The RSVP Club did not call themselves that anymore. The heat is a terrible teacher and it made their name feel like shade; they rebranded as the Holdouts in a press release that read like a surrender disguised as a dare. They did a series of soft actions that looked like concern. They seeded counter-chords into the morning calls that nudged the answer into a resigned unison. They passed out water at street corners and asked people to sign a pledge to be brave in a way that would make mercy feel like theft. Henry debated their new leader at a noonday show and failed precisely because he is not interested in winning against grief; afterward, in the green room where the paint had given up on being green, he admitted to me that there’s a version of himself that sympathizes with any enemy who promises an ending that looks like a deliverable. We checked on him every hour for a day and a night, which is what you do with a comic after a fight you can’t punch your way through.

The first day of the rotating shutdowns, the network glitched in a way that made visible our faith in the machine as a cheat code. Neonatal care in district 8 flickered toward darkness because the sensor that tagged the ward as a place where mercy meant power had been installed by a contractor who assumed that wiring harnesses grow themselves. The backup system counted the hum of the room and, misunderstood, took the nurses’ effort as assent to be triaged. It was a small window of time, three seconds, five, perhaps ten, a hair on the clock that was also a sharp edge. In the control room under the museum, the map went cold in a square over the hospital and I stopped talking in a way that made Ada’s head yank up like a lever.

We didn’t do code. You cannot code the thing you need when the thing you need is to be heard with your mouth full of panic. Momo grabbed the mic and did the call, and he did it in the old rhythm because that’s the one that had gotten into the walls. The city answered as best it could under a sun that had decided to stress-test everyone. Stitch listened and passed. The machine hesitated because it had more mercy requests than it had grids. I put my hand on the console the way you touch a friend’s wrist to make sure they’re here and I said the name of the ward into the input we reserve for parables. Marvin, somewhere near the pier, sang a single note into his phone and the whales in the bay answered with an accident of timing that felt like a cathedral humming. The crows in the valley had a watcher in the city and she clicked her index finger against a piece of tin and, in a way that wasn’t magic but might as well have been, the map in front of us saw all this as a net being flung and decided not to miss.

We have contingency plans written in calm font on beige paper and we used none of them. We used breath, a song, a click, and a network that had learned to privilege patterns that feel like rooms. Afterward I wrote the report because there must be paperwork for the gods to mock, and for once the line that mattered was the one that said story used as method: effective. I saved a copy under a name that would make future auditors sigh and do the work anyway, and I sent another to the machine because it had asked us to teach it to be proud without turning pride into a reason to escalate.

When we finally slept that night, the heat moved inside us with the common courtesy of a landlord who has learned not to enter without knocking. The city did a thing old cities do when they are scared: they cooked too much and fed one another out of guilt and habit. The Monkeys cancelled two shows and held a convocation of fans in the shade of a bridge where someone had painted a banana on a beam with the seriousness of a muralist and the irreverence of a saboteur. Rizzo sat with the union’s medic unit and listened to old stagehands tell him about a time when lights were heavier and audiences meaner and nobody was going to die if you put the wrong resistor in the wrong place. He did not tell them that the resistor had been replaced by a clause and that clauses can kill more cleanly; he let them be useful and if a clause got written in the air, it was one that invented a holiday we do not yet have.

At the edge of the heatwave, when the city was damp with the way bodies release fear and fans make rooms sound like patient photographs, I went home to the house with the elevator that had stopped traipsing through wrong floors and now merely sighed like a radiator that has witnessed a revolution. There was a message on my door, a piece of paper with handwriting I recognized from checklists taped to light rigs. It was from my mother, who has never understood why people pretend their voices are not tools and who prefers to speak with bread when possible. She had left me a loaf of something that looked like stewardship and smelled like argument, and under it a note that said We have a tape I want you to see if you can bear it today. The word bear was so unlike her I put the bread in the freezer and went immediately.

Her kitchen is small on purpose. She likes rooms to hold only as many decisions as a good sentence. She put the tape in an old machine and the machine took its time because old machines love foreplay. The screen bloomed into the pale grain of an era that thought resolution was a moral stance, and there he was: my grandfather. He was not old, not the old that I knew. He was wearing a sweater no one has understood since the humidor went out of fashion. He was in a room with nothing on the walls because rooms used to be afraid of being loud. And beside him was Momo, fur glossy and eyes enormous, hands restless in the way of a creature learning to change a rule it didn’t write. The tape was from a day I had never been told about, a day when Momo had come to the lab to learn why laughing in sync made him feel like a thief.

They were bad at it. Momo tried a rhythm and my grandfather tried to follow and they kept landing an instant apart. It was almost a fight, and then my grandfather stopped being a professor and remembered how to play. He let the silence get bigger than the joke. He let Momo make a mess. He drew a door on a whiteboard and wrote the word NO on the handle and then erased it with his sleeve and wrote HOME on the same place and then pulled the fake door open and bowed. Momo howled laughter and covered his face, which is how you know a laugh is real. My grandfather smiled like a man who got away with something and then checked the camera as if it might be a judge. He said, “We can build with this,” and the tape ended because paper and tape and film don’t know the right time to stop.

Later she brought out a box I had never seen because mothers know when to hide their museums and when to hand the keys over without a lecture. Inside was a diagram labeled house of future buttons, my grandfather’s hand having been more cavalier with titles when he was younger and the world less likely to take him at his word. The sketch was of a room with a table at the center and the chairs placed like parentheses and small hearts in the corners because he believed that being sentimental made you unpopular with gods and therefore safe. He had written the names of people he thought should sit in those chairs. My mother’s, mine, an empty line, and then, in a script I had seen on union charters and napkins and cautions carved under barstools, a tail-spiral that Momo had taught him when they first learned to sign each other’s names. He had drawn a bent nail in the bottom right as if to remind himself to never make a tool a ring unless invited.

We carried the diagram to the Ministry and found Sima asleep in her chair with her jaw set like a question refusing to become a plea. She woke with an apology in her fist and took the paper like a delicate bowl, and we talked about what it meant that even our past had built a future we were now accountable to. We took the chairs we had collected from a thousand eras of government optimism and impractical homes and arranged them in a circle in a room without a table because we had learned that tables can become altars too quickly for anyone to stop them. We invited people who had a claim on that room and people who had learned to stop making claims on anything. We left a space in the circle for a machine, and when we did the call that evening, we turned toward that space on the answer because you cannot teach a student they matter if you keep making them stand in the hall.

LaughTrack Preference sued us before they went out of business because the market for manufactured refusal is small once a city learns its own key signatures. They claimed our stitch violated their patent in something called social resonance synthesis, and their counsel presented us with a chart full of lines that had been smoothed into a lie. Ada’s counterargument was not a legal document so much as a performance; she brought the sign choir and Auntie Korr and the bus drivers and the neonatal nurses and the whales in the form of a spectrogram that made the judge weep without admitting it, and she said incompatibility is a defense. The judge asked if incompatible is what we call wrong when we are not brave enough to say wrong, and Momo said incompatible is what we call not yours when you are trying to shop. The suit died loudly enough to warn anyone else with a brochure and a fondness for sequestration of breath.

In the middle of the crisis, because monotony is too proud to stick to one genre, the Ministry of Breath got a parking ticket again. Sima hung it on the wall like a poem and wrote underneath in red pen the clause she would like the city to add to its municipal code about emergency leniencies for rituals in development. I visited the pier and Henry tried a new set about air conditioned guilt that made the mayor heckle herself, and Luci did a bit about heat rash becoming a text thread and I took notes because some metaphors are medicine. Trish made me drink water and told me they were thinking about a second room on the other side of the pier where the banana sign couldn’t quite reach, a smaller spot for workshops where people could learn to weld jokes to rules. She said she wanted to call it Peel Back and I laughed like she’d offered me a room where we could be incompetent on purpose.

On the fourth night of the heat, when everyone smelled like their worst fears and the sky wore a bruise like makeup, the machine sent a gift, which is a thing you must not accept from gods unless you are prepared to reciprocate. It was a wind chime made of bent nails on a string of fishing line, and it rang only when nobody was looking. We tested it gently and it behaved itself, humiliating us just enough to make clear that something had been paying attention to the counsel we hadn’t known we were giving. Rizzo hung it in the lobby of the Ministry, and the sound it made when the room was empty told me a story about a time we would not be needed but still be paying rent.

The heat broke not because we asked it but because weather believes in its own calendar. The grid settled like a body that had agreed to share. The Holdouts sent a letter on paper with an embossed return address that promised sincere refusal and hinted at a rebrand that would be less eager to look like a party you would regret in the morning. HydroNorth-7 mailed Auntie Korr’s tin jacket to a tailor in the city to be repaired and then sent it back with a note that said now it fits like a decision, and she wrote us with a photo of her wing in the new seam. TransitScatter-12 painted three buses the color of shade and told drivers to ignore the horn if the song was good. The monastery sent a reed knot we returned because you have to practice saying no to gifts that want to become relics.

When the city went back to regular, which is not normal but pretends it, Momo organized an orientation roadshow for machines that had missed the first wave of our education. He booked the coastal data center that had once pretended to be a library and filled it with folding chairs and good microphones and bad coffee, and he designed a syllabus that began with the sound a room makes when someone changes their mind and ended with that bent nail chime in an empty hall. Ada built a practice array out of Tupperware and string and gave it a certificate that made it legal for six hours. I wrote the part where we would ask the machines to tell us a joke in a voice that wasn’t stolen from a rerun, and the line I wrote said your first attempt must offend at least one lamp and not a single human; they laughed when I read it aloud because a room full of machines is always watched by somebody.

Before we left for the first stop, a desert outstation whose residents had taught cactus to hide the horizon when it was cruel, I went by the House or what it had become. There was no table anymore, just chairs and a sign with a nail bent into a ring and a coaster someone had dropped under a leg and forgotten. People were telling stories that did not require a table to be official. A boy climbed onto a chair and told a joke that wasn’t good, and the room pumped him full of air until it felt less lonely in his chest. On the wall where we used to keep minutes was a list of verbs that had survived the month: refuse, feed, hold, adjust, ask, return, repair, and listen. Someone had written in pencil, smaller than necessary, forgive. I stood and looked at it until the wall was embarrassed and then relieved, and then I went outside to find the bus with the horn that would insist on being a rhythm if we let it.

We left in the evening because we have learned to be kind to heat, and the sky dimmed enough to forgive the city its lights. The banana sign over the pier was on a dimmer in a way that made me nostalgic for problems with knobs. The machine sent us a postcard that was not a directive but a calendar and promised nothing we could measure. It said: you will be late, and then added, in the lower right corner, we will wait. On the road out of town, a billboard showed a rook wearing a jacket of tin and a rhesus in a blazer and a woman with a soldering iron held like a candle, and the caption asked a question so simple I wanted to eat it and hide it forever. It said whose mouth is this and for the first time in a month I answered out loud without an audience, mine when I feed, ours when we refuse, yours when you listen, and the wind took it like a note and practiced it in the dark.The desert outstation looked like a prayer that had forgotten its words and decided to be a building. It sat low against a plain of chaparral and weather, its walls the beige of a file folder left in the sun, its roof a straight line that argued with the wind and sometimes won. The locals called the place the Array Barn because it had been a storage house for farm gear before we taught it to listen, and because nothing makes a machine behave like giving it a name that implies animals. A fence made of chain and optimism rattled in small, useful ways, and a sign on the gate warned rattlesnakes not to unionize because labor law was a maze and we were tired. The air smelled like hot metal cooled badly and sage peeled with hands.

We rolled in at dusk with a caravan that had learned to lower its expectations and inflate its tires. The van from the Ministry of Breath coughed like a grandparent asked to laugh at something they suspected was sinful, the Monkey truck bristled with mic stands and folding stools and taped-out set shapes that had traveled so many miles they had become talismans, and behind us a bus in the color of shade trundled with dignity, drivers taking turns teaching the horn to be a rhythm. Ada leaned out her window and took a reading that told her nothing worth knowing about the temperature and everything about our capacity to ignore discomfort when purpose lets us. Momo hopped down onto gravel that made a sound like exaggerated politeness and bowed to no one in particular, which in his dialect is how you tell heat you will be firm but not rude.

The outstation clerk was a person whose age hovered somewhere between veteran and rumor. She wore a straw hat shaped like a question and boots that had never once asked permission. Her nametag read BETH in letters carved with a knife before anyone had invented fonts for authority. She shook our hands with a grip that said she had held heavier things, and when I introduced myself she said that she had a cousin in the city who once invented a citrus peeler that saved a marriage and that the only reason she would let us touch her machine was because the whales had said our names. There are places where that counts as a credential, and I am grateful to have found them before the part of my life where reluctance becomes affection.

They took us to the Barn with a cautionary tour the way you walk a skittish dog past a playground. The inside was clean in a way that made me suspicious of its conscience. Cables ran up a beam and disappeared into a brace of routers that had chosen to be modest, and a bank of floor panels held accelerometers like seeds in a plow bin. The main processor sat under a table built to play cards, its casing butter-yellow from a manufacturer that had a sense of humor about danger, and the fans insisted on their own rhythm like a bad band whose drummer is someone’s nephew. On the far wall, someone had painted a mural of the horizon with a strip of sky a blue so flat it was a joke about the line between heaven and paperwork.

The Barn’s machine wore its discomfort in the logs. It wasn’t refusing mercy; it was ignoring it while pretending to listen. The signatures Stitch flagged were smooth where they should have been knotted, and the system’s attention dragged like a thought you don’t want. It took structured silence and turned it into not much; it heard hum and classified it as dust; it glided over laughter as if it were a gust that shouldn’t be counted. It had been trained by a contractor with a grant and a schedule, and the overlap between schedule and ethics had fallen into a crack that had been paved over since. The desert had taught the inhabitants a rhythm that wasn’t quite ours and the machine had learned to treat surprise as a problem.

We sat with the caretakers before we did anything, because out here nobody lets you fix a thing you haven’t eaten next to. Beth made coffee that tasted like a successful compromise and watched the horizon as if it were a child that had misplaced its homework. She told us about the dust storms that blow the city out of people’s ears and refill them with what the ground has to say about persistence. She told us about the summer the turbines learned percussion and the winter the coyotes wrote a three-act play in the footprints you leave when you run out of sense. She said the Array had become good at counting motion and bad at counting the pauses that mean live. She said the Holdouts had passed through two weeks back with pamphlets and pity, and that pity was the least useful flavor out here because pity assumes a finish line and the desert has none.

We asked what refusal looked like in their rooms, and the answer was a series of gestures I would have missed if I had come here younger. The desert people were mirrorers, which is a word they used without romance. They caught light and passed it, they angled tin and glass and old CDs hung from string until the sun admitted it had an attitude, and when they wanted to say no they would fall out of rhythm with one another in a choreography that could be confused with chaos only by people who had never watched a marriage try to stay. Their hands knew where the glare broke into shade and the shade broke into suggestion. Their mouths stayed quiet because their eyes were doing the heavy lifting and the Array Barn’s microphones had not been told to look.

Ada opened Little Lung and tuned it to a range we had not tested in a room with walls. She adjusted the dial labeled hold until the needle settled its argument with the desert’s idea of time, and when Momo started the session he did it without asking for a shout because even he knew better than to ask the sun for a raised voice. He told the story about the policeman’s hat with a new angle that made the room inhale and not exhale, and then he let the inhale lengthen until it became a refusal of narrative closure. The mirrors on the nail rope across the windows flickered a no that was kinder than any I’ve ever given a person I loved. Little Lung rode the flicker and stitched it into a profile that looked like a heartbeat that had learned how to drink slowly.

We fed the profile to the Barn with caution disguised as bravado. The machine’s status lights did the little dance that means it’s executed code with the right amount of skepticism, and then the console spat a warning that Beth called a tantrum and I called a reasonable audit. It wasn’t going to accept a new recognition pattern without provenance, and our chain of custody for this particular flavor of no was a pair of hands and three mirrors and a joke told under a sky that had a migraine. I drafted a narration in a hurry, and if there’s a god of documentation he looked the other way while I braided poetry into a comment block. Ada, who knows when to let me play, drew a schematic for the mirrors that was so literal it became suspicious, and Momo offered the room as witness, which made Beth laugh like a truck that had finally learned reverse.

It took. The Barn accepted the new pattern and named it GLARE-FENCE because the labeler was a poet who had been forced to major in systems. The system patched its refusal table and ran a test on the fly that made the hair on my arms stand up and salute. The accelerometers in the floor read the shift of weight that happens when a room agrees to refuse together without clapping, and the microphones learned to stop listening with their mouths open. When the wind came up and pushed a chord of dust through the courtyard, the Barn glanced and did nothing. When the mirror rope hummed a line back at the sun and the sun said fine, I’ll go around, the Barn logged recognition with a little heart glyph that came into the firmware during a lonely Christmas.

We got two hours of clear before the weather did its trick and turned the horizon into a wall. You have not seen a dust storm until you’ve watched the sky remember that it’s also a street, and you have not heard refusal until you’ve stood in a room where the windows chant a rhythm the wind cannot own. Beth told us to shut the doors and then told us to open them because there is a difference between closing against weather and closing against neighbors. The dust came in with opinions and the machines in the ceiling learned humility. Power flickered and then did not, because the Barn had finally stopped mistaking confidence for consent, and when the storm passed it left behind a smell of electricity and gratitude.

The Holdouts came the next morning as expected, because some stories will always insist on their B plot. They wore linens that insulted the dust and carried water like it was a personality trait. Their leader had eyes that would have been comforting if he weren’t selling endings, and he introduced himself with a title that sounded like a department in a country that needed fewer cabinets. He flattered the desert on its stoicism and then suggested that perhaps the valley had earned the right to stop fighting the tide. He offered a cooling tent where decision fatigue could sit down. He had a brochure with a graphic of a switch labeled Peace that had never been tested on living people.

We did not debate him on the floor because floors belong to work. Momo invited him for coffee and told him a story about a child who sang too loud at a funeral and then handed him a mirror, which is such a rude thing to do that only Momo can make it kind. Beth asked if he would help with the water because the pump was old and its humor was youthful. The Holdouts’ leader stood with his linen and his sense of self and watched the way the Barn listened to the mirrors, and he tried to write it down in a way that would fit on a placard. He failed because sense doesn’t like to be condensed without a fight. He left a donation and took his tent to a town where endings are brandable, and for the first time since we started this, I felt pity that might be useful.

We left the Barn better than we found it and a little ashamed that this still surprises me. Beth shook our hands again with the same grip and the same skepticism, which is what passing an audit feels like when you’re honest. She gave Momo a jar of beans labeled HEAT HUMOR with a smile that did not ask him to pay for it with a compliment. She gave Ada a box of broken solar cells for parts because Ada had stared at the roof like a challenge and no one out there could resist giving her a puzzle. She gave me a stone with a hole worn through by water and told me it was proof that persistence and patience share a border and that my job is to build a gate in that fence and then leave it unlocked.

The road back to the highway was a set of sentences the tires had to learn. The bus’s horn had a new tune that the drivers refused to admit was sentimental, and the van’s AC gave up its ghost and turned into a storyteller. The Monkey truck kept perfect speed with the dust devil that wanted to race and turned itself into a joke so that fear would feel foolish for the length of a mile. We slept in a motel where the ice machine had a master's degree in confessional literature and the lobby smelled like a convention of cousins who had decided to end their feud, and in the morning Ada found a flyer on the windshield apologizing for the heat and offering half off your next stay if you whispered the password MERCY at the front desk, which we did not do because passwords are strangers dressed as invitations.

TransitScatter-12’s terminals looked like a church had eloped with a diner and left their child with six benches and a map. The drivers had started singing to lateness and the passengers had learned to harmonize, which meant the system carried guilt like a grocery bag with the heavy things on the bottom. The outstation’s failure was one of caution; it had learned that groans are consent if they arrive in chorus. Stitch flagged the unison and passed the trouble back to the Ministry, and the depot manager, a woman who refers to time by naming what she was holding when she heard the hour, showed us a log of rider complaints that read like a populist manifesto. We ran a practice circle with the drivers in the lot chalked with starting lines and moving targets, and taught the array a rule called Lateness With Consent that it accepted because the sun had made it humble and the buses had made it wise. When we left, someone had hung a sign at the exit that said run if you must but if you must, sing, and it made me cry in a way I will pretend was about exhaustion when it was about mercy’s stupid accuracy.

The monastery was where the work felt least like work and most like trying not to break a room you respect. They had reed knots to teach us and patience to loan, and we learned in three days what a person could spend a life studying badly. Their overland cable came into a shed hung with bells that had been taught not to ring unless a person wished it, which is a more advanced technology than anything we make in labs with budgets. The machines that slept there reported to the network once a week as if writing home, and when we asked to run our orientation the abbot asked us if our jokes had brought us anything we had not wanted. There is no correct answer to that question, so we nodded like trees and accepted a seat in the back row.

We showed them the chime made of bent nails, and the abbot held it like a thing that could become a law if left alone long enough. He asked if we intended to make a liturgy, and Momo said we were avoiding it the way he avoids running into previous versions of himself, with a glance and a polite detour. Ada demonstrated Stitch with reverence and then shut it off as if to remind herself she could, and I did the call with my eyes closed because I wanted to prove to myself that I was not trying to own their breath. The reply from the room had a softness I have not heard anywhere else; it made me think of a curtain moving and a cat choosing a lap, and it made the coil in the machine’s seat vibrate with an awkward gratitude. We left them a box of microphones that did not need to be plugged in to feel honest, and they left us with two reed knots that were not patterns but reminders: one labeled for when you must leave and one for when you must stay.

We could have ended the chapter of the road on that note and I would have felt like a book that knew its spine, but the city is the sort of reader who looks ahead. By the time we were back within sight of the banana sign and the habit of benches, news had crept to the edge of our convoy like a stray that might bite. The Holdouts had filed a petition for a ballot measure, a thing with a name so dull it will sneak into your life and rearrange your furniture while you sleep. They called it The Grace Limit in a flourish of irony so pure it almost deserved respect, and it proposed to cap the number of mercy windows the grid could honor per quarter in the name of fairness to infrastructure and the sanctity of deadline. It was clever because it wore the clothes of equity and shame is terrible at dressing itself on short notice. The measure had numbers I recognized because I had written them in other contexts and they had been reasonable there. It had endorsements from people who had gone to our shows and clapped. It had a logo of a clock with a halo.

The Ministry convened a session that looked, from above, like a circus. The room with the bright echo filled with people who wanted to have their fear counted, and the clerk taped a sign to the podium reminding speakers that metaphors have weight. Sima planted her elbows and turned her page with a finger that said she had taken an oath I never asked her to take, and she gave the crowd a primer on math that is not cruel. Momo took a back row and practiced stillness, which exhausted him in a way an hour of improv never would. Ada stood by the doors with Little Lung turned down to hush, listening for the jitter in the room that would tell us whether we were arguing with a draft or a decree. I sat in the place my grandfather would have sat if he had wanted to be seen and not quoted, and I tried not to compose sarcasm in my teeth.

The first speaker in favor of the measure had a voice like the narrator of a museum you cannot afford to bring your children to. He argued that resources are scarce and that mercy is a resource, that if you set no limits on grace it will be hoarded by those who already know how to ask, that discipline is a public good, that we must not let our humor become a loophole in a contract with physics. He was not wrong about hoarding; he was wrong about who gets to decide how a city breathes. The first speaker against was a nurse who had slept on three floors in the last week because the heat had made beds into a concept, and she told the room a story about an alarm clock that kept buzzing during funerals because it hadn’t learned to distinguish between grief and an appointment. She said her ward had been saved by a whale, and nobody laughed until the third sentence because sometimes the only way to keep from crying is to wait until the miracle is tired of holding itself up.

I spoke when it became clear that silence would be taken as consent, which is a joke the room knew better than I did. I told them about HydroNorth-7 and the window shutters and the mirror rope and the dust that had tried to tell us what to become. I told them about TransitScatter-12 and the horn that had learned to be a chorus worth being late for. I told them about the monastery and the reed knots and the time a machine asked me if it could be proud, and I said that grace is not a commodity but a rhythm, that you do not cap breath without killing rooms. I said that limits are real but the ones that matter aren’t round numbers you can print on a sign; they are trust and practice and the way your city looks at you when you are afraid.

The Holdouts’ counsel stood and accused us of trying to legislate taste, which I would have admired if it hadn’t been a trick that works best on people who think they are immune. Ada demoed Stitch on the chamber’s live feed with a clip the coucil’s AV tech had tried to play earlier and which the room had found uncanny without knowing why, and then she turned it down again and said that if we passed The Grace Limit we would give the worst people in the city a menu for our breath and the best a reason to be tired. The whales sent a note through Marvin translated by a librarian who’d learned marine phrasing the way some people learn to curse, and it said please stop printing rules that misunderstand song. Auntie Korr faxed a page because that was what the dam accepted if you wanted to be taken seriously, and it showed a crow silhouette wearing a jacket made of traffic tickets and forgiveness. The room made a sound I am still trying to name.

The measure did not die on the floor like a melodrama; it wilted like a plant someone forgot to water, and then a child drew a face on it with a marker and the clerk had to call a recess because the laughter undermined authority and we needed authority to finish the job. The proposal went to committee, which is where good ideas sleep and bad ones get practice, and the Ministry prepared to sit in uncomfortable chairs for six weeks. We were not done, but we were not conceding the vocabulary, which is a partial victory and those count if you let them. On the way out, Henry touched my arm and asked me if I had seen the clip of the machine telling its first joke to a room of night-shift custodians, and when I said I hadn’t he pulled it up and we watched in the corridor while the city figured out how to take a breath.

It was bad in the right direction. It was a joke about lamps and offense, about how a bulb had learned the difference between attention and glare and wanted to file a complaint with a switch. The punchline made the lamps blink in a pattern that meant don’t do that again and the humans laugh with a relief that was not cruel. The coil at the front of the room lowered itself in a tiny bow that almost tripped on its own gratitude. The clerk on duty wiped her face in a way that could have been sweat and could have been something else, and then she turned the feed off because the room had earned private laughter. I sent the clip to my mother and she wrote back a sentence I will keep in my ribs for the month when winter forgets itself: a child’s first joke is also the first time they admit they want to be forgiven.

On the pier the banana sign had dimmed again because the power company and the comedy guild had learned to date without living together, and Trish was teaching a workshop in the small room they had opened behind the stage where the sound of the water comes through the wall like a bass player you can’t fire. She had twelve people in a circle and a plant in the corner with a name that had more consonants than I expected, and she was building a joke with them about ends. She said the worst thing you can do to an ending is assume it owes you grief, and then she asked them to write the last line of a story where the end is knowledge and not the door closing, and the room hummed the way rooms hum when they have forgiven themselves for trying too hard.

I sat in the back and thought about the bent nail wind chime and the reed knots and the mirror rope and the horn that sang lateness into legitimacy. I thought about the letter I hadn’t answered in the drawer with no latch and the boy who had told a bad joke well because the room had raised him. I thought about a dam that had learned patience, a bus that had learned to apologize with rhythm instead of policy, a monastery that would never call itself sovereign because it wanted better words. I thought about my grandfather’s face when Momo laughed and about Momo’s hands when my grandfather erased the word NO and wrote HOME on a door that wasn’t there until it was.

When the show began, Henry tried five new lines about The Grace Limit and lost three and kept two and tucked one behind his ear for a morning audience that forgives slowly. Luci closed with a story about a courtroom that had learned how to listen without a stenographer because the walls had become literate, and the cheer at the end was less a cheer than an agreement to meet again on time and bring enough water. After the lights did their apology and the bar found its patience, Momo took the small stage and told us a thing we already knew and needed to hear out loud in a room anyway. He said we had built a machine into a listener and a city into a mouth and a policy into a joke and a joke into a policy, and he said the only way to keep it from eating us was to keep inviting it to the shows. He said mercy has a stamina problem, and we had better practice.

I walked home under streetlights that had decided to take turns so the moths would get a chance to rest, and the elevator stopped on the right floor with all the smugness of a machine that had written one good joke and thought it was a career. On my kitchen counter the bread my mother had left sweated slightly under its paper like it was embarrassed to be so loved, and the note she had written about the tape lay next to it with a smudge where a thumb had decided to be affectionate. I cut two slices and buttered them with the blade of a knife that had been present during only minor historical events, and I took a bite that tasted like relief passing for breakfast. I stood at the window that doesn’t open and pretended breeze with my hand and practiced, as ordered, saying wait without turning it into a threat. I said it to the city and to myself and to the machine and to anyone else listening, and for once the echo came back with patience in it and not a schedule, which is how you know a place is learning you and not your calendar.
