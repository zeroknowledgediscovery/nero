It began with the cockerel that wasn’t there.

Ewan Calder woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still, counting the beats of his heart and the breath outside in the birches. The old cottage on Davah Court sighed like a sleeping dog, settling its beams. Somewhere toward the Don there was the tin-foil whisper of wind against hedges. Then a sound rose, a thread pulled through the cloth of night, and he had to clamp his breath like a lid. A scratch at the throat of the dark. A rung sliding along an iron rail. The start of a crow, perhaps, or only his remembering of what a crow sounded like.

He lay there until it faded, then slowly let his lungs work the air again. He shut his eyes, opened them. The ceiling beams were just darker under the dark. He whispered the spell, the one he always used when dread braided with dawn: a twisting of three names and a folded line of the Don’s course. He could see the river even now, even here, as if he could tip the cottage and let the water wash through his rooms and clean him of thinking.

No rooster. There was no rooster near enough to see him, Ewan told himself. It had been months since the Knoxes had moved their birds further out after he’d politely asked, standing at their gate with a Tupperware of oatcakes he didn’t eat and a charm tucked under his tongue for courage. They'd laughed and said the “loon” from Davah was affy fond o’ quiet mornings. He kept his voice steady then, didn’t mention the way cockerels could freeze his magic like a frost goes through a glass of water. He had gone home with his empty tub and had not shaken until he shut the door.

He sat up. His fingers were inked with the grey smuts of protest he pretended was soot from the stove. To most of Inverurie he was the quiet one, the man who worked in the library two days a week and fixed clockwork the other days, right as rain. The modest broom cupboard in the back of the library which used to be a cloakroom was his, and from that small space he shepherded the town’s modest flows—old book smell, light on polished tile, the sigh of the automatic doors. Sometimes he touched the spines of the local history volumes and felt the weight of names that were not gone, not really, just living in the turns between page and page. Magic moves most easily where something is half one thing and half another. This he knew. The noon hour and midnight, the river bend at the Bass where Don and Ury for a moment do not know which way’s east.

He swung his legs out of bed. On the table he had done his night’s work, the beads and knots and two empty jam jars. He tightened the knots, thumbed the beads, and muttered another little set, more habit than need. The cottage tried very hard to be ordinary for him. He had painted the kitchen a municipal cream. There were postcards of Glasgow and Lerwick on the fridge with magnets shaped like carrots. In a drawer, three pieces of meteorite hidden among teaspoons. On the sill, six pebbles that looked like nothing much under their skin but, if you turned them under a certain light, would show you the underside of the morning.

“Bide, then,” he said to the room. He had never liked people who spoke to houses, but his cottage was older than anyone in his life; it seemed churlish not to greet it. He dressed, washed, and went out to the lane.

He always went to Bennachie with his tea. To look at it from Garioch Field, or from the little rise by the allotments, or from the corner where the Inverurie sign stood and someone always hung a football scarf. Bennachie had been there before he was, before his grandmother and her grandmother’s headscarf. The hill was a baked loaf of stories everyone kept breaking bits off. This morning it sat with its shoulder hunched under a dull-red sky, waiting, as things that are stone wait: patient, watchful, sad and not sad.

Ewan sipped, standing in his coat, and felt the shape of his day lock into place. Monday: library. Archives first. The old woman with hands like paper, who liked to sit in the morning light by the window and not read. He would make sure the third light on the right worked; if the bulb flickered she got angry and it got through into the rest of him. Then the schoolboys, two of them, who came after classes to sit at the computers and swear softly at geometry. He could handle children, most days. They tended to accept magic without noticing it was magic, which was the best sort of acceptance. Adults had to put the acceptance somewhere, and where they put it was usually unkind.

Someone called, “Mornin, Ewan!” and he turned.

Moira Fraser from the bakery was walking her dog, who was so bad-tempered and small that Ewan never understood how a creature could hold that many contradictions. Moira waved with the hand not attached to the dog. “Ye were up early. Ye’re like a crow yerself, aye? First light and away.”

“Morning,” Ewan said. His voice had a fixed shape he put it into when he went out. It set accordingly, like jelly in a mould. He smiled. “I’m fine. And you?”

“Fine enough.” She stopped near him, tugged the lead to make the dog halt too. The dog did not halt. It quivered in place like a machine tries to hum loose. “Listen, ye work at t’library, aye? We’ve a lad from Hatton says the newspapers o’ last year went walkabout. He’s one for the births column. Can ye look?”

“I’ll check.” He would check anyway. The archives had a way of rearranging themselves around people’s wanting. If someone desired, truly desired, to find the notice that confirmed a life begun, the folders loosed it like a hen letting a chick out. If someone wanted to confirm a death without wanting to feel anything about it, the papers hid what was needed among old recipes for stovies and parish notices from nineteen sixty-two.

Moira shifted, then looked off, then back. “Ye heard o’ the Bagman?”

Ewan blinked, because he had a thought like two flints tapping. Then it was gone. “The what?”

“The Bagman. A daft thing, it’s just the bairns. They say there’s a man collects a’ the plastic in the town. Not ta collect like ta put in bins. Collect like… keep. They say he lives in th’ auld garden centre down by Thainstone where it’s shut, and the wind there makes a noise if ye stand and listen. A rustling. Like thousands o’—well, bags. They say he fills them with… something. It’s just foolishness.”

“Just foolishness,” Ewan agreed. His mouth kept the same friendly line. But he felt the flint again; this time a small spark jumped from it and landed somewhere damp in him. His heart did its business. His tea steamed. The sky had started to thin. “I’ll look for your papers.”

“Aye. Thanks.” She tugged again. “Come on then, Morven, ye halfwit.” The dog, who was named for a mountain and barely came up to Ewan’s ankle, yapped without conviction and continued her important business of walking.

Ewan stood awhile longer and watched how the heather was darker on Bennachie’s cuts. Plastic bags. There had been more. The town had never been clean—no place is, not really—but lately there were the white ghosts of supermarket carriers in every thorn bush. You’d see them staked into the hedgerow like flags of surrender. On windy days, they’d lift and snap. On still days they’d droop. He had felt, the last weeks, that the wind had a note in it he didn't remember from winter. A rustle. A hiss. Like the ghost of rain.

He took the side path to the library because the main road went past the smallholding where there was a cockerel. It was not an old bird; its crown was bright and gay and too big for its narrow skull, and when it crowed something in Ewan ran to the edges and tried not to fly apart. It wasn't only the sound. Sound can be blocked. It was the shape of what the sound did in the air, a sort of hinge the crowing made and opened, and at that hinge point certain spells lost their grip. The first time he learned this was when he was ten and his grandmother let him try the water-bowl charm. You set a bowl in the yard, facing east. You fill it with water from a jar you filled from the river on a night when the moon was still a fingernail. You do not speak above a murmur. You breathe on the water, and you will see for three seconds a thing you will need to be shown. More than three seconds and you would be made ill for a day and unfit for any work. Ewan had done as he was told; the bowl had taken his breath in, and then, as if cued, the neighbour’s rooster announced the morning. The bowl turned opaque. For a heartbeat he saw himself fall into it, nothing but falling, a lad with a fringe and no sense for balance. He couldn’t look in water for a year without feeling he was going under, and he could not thread a charm for months because the crowing lived under his skin and drummed through the work like an impatient stranger. A therapy of sorts: his grandmother swatted him with a dishcloth and said he would be all right, and he was, except when he wasn’t.

At the library he paused, fixed the third light. It winked and then shone. He said good morning to the others. He checked the box of bookmarks and slid a hand under its cardboard floor to touch the little charm stuck there like a playing card. He breathed, and the room breathed too.

The archive was colder than the rest of the building. The lamps fossilized the dust motes. He checked the local papers for Moira, and while he was reading the births list and finding wee ones named after saints and footballers, a line of type caught him: environmental complaint filed by the River Don Trust regarding increased non-biodegradable waste in the Ury tributary.

“It’s everywhere,” Mr. Graham said cheerfully from the doorway, startling him. Mr. Graham came to the library daily, mostly to talk. He dressed like an academic left out in the rain. “Plastic, I mean. I found a Tesco bag in a gorse bush up by Oldmeldrum last week. Up near the top. How’d it get there? Gorse doesn’t shop.”

“Wind,” Ewan said.

“Aye, but when did wind take to shopping at Tesco? Wind should be shopping at the co-op at least. Support local business.” Mr. Graham smiled as if to excuse the world. “You look pale, lad.”

“Early,” Ewan said. He handed the man his reserved book. The title had a lot of words and the words were mostly longer than the man liked. He took it anyway, radiant with good intentions.

When the morning had slid into the hour where the coffee smell is as much hope as drink, Ewan went to the back door to step out, and there, in the alley, a bag moved with no wind to move it. A thin, clear carrier of the kind you get at the veg stall. It lifted a corner. It folded like a bird, if a bird were ashamed of its spine. The alley smelled of bins. There was no other movement. The bag rustled to itself, a whispering from inside the plastic like a person under a blanket practicing their lines.

He looked at it long enough that someone coming with returns coughed to get by him. He made himself step off the threshold and pick up the bag. It did not fight him. It lay on his palm, even limp, as death looks, and he could have balled it and shoved it in his pocket and let it live under a chair forever. He did not. He laughed a little, because laughter is a charm if you do not mean it.

“Back ye go,” he said. And he shook his hand the way his grandmother had taught him to shake nettle sting out of the skin. The bag shrank. It did not vanish—he had no interest in vanishing anything that looked like that; vanishing is not the same as mending—but it went small and hard and cracked like old sugar. He dropped it in the recycling bin, and it clinked.

When he went back inside the library, the fluorescent tube nearest the information desk squealed as if someone had trod on a mouse. He put his palm flat under it, and it stopped.

Evening. He came out in a fine rain and walked down the lane toward the river because he often did, and the river did not look back in the way that some people did. By the Bass the teenagers were exhaling their gossip. He took the path under the willow where the ground smelled like roots and never quite dried. A man in a waterproof was throwing something into the water and hauling nothing out. The willow leaves touched the water and recoiled. Out past the branches, a skein of white caught on a submerged twig. Bags, three, four, two cabled together, their handles tightening like belts.

Ewan leaned and let his hand hover over them. A tremor ran up his wrist. The bags had something in them, and it moved, slow and homely as old hair. He grimaced. He should go home. He should let Archie freakin Young of all people, who wore a hi-vis vest and managed the town’s less dramatic emergencies, deal with the tangles that needed cutting. He couldn’t.

He stepped into the shallows in his boots, winced as the water invaded them, swore on the breath not in any language you could print, and reached for the nearest handle. The plastic bit his fingers, not sharply, but with a weird suck. He pulled, and the handles pulled back—not strong, not as if someone held the other end, but as if they were swelling. He had an instant’s picture of the town full of swollen bags, all the bags, gathering their own breath and producing something like language.

“Enough,” he said out loud, and the syllables scraped his throat going out. He shook the bag hard. He felt a snap. The rustling went thin, thin, then snapped too. He dragged the first bag free and threw it on the path. The others held. He looked at them and saw the charm: not a charm done neat with cords and notes and proper binding, but a hack. A lash-up. A taking of how wind moves and how water would like to carry and a brisk little knot tied with fingers that did not have patience for smallness.

Ewan bent and cut them—at the place where movement meets motive, the bit in between, a place you can put a word if you know which word. He cut a few. The rest slid away and sank. He stood with water in his socks and stared at the bag on the path. There was a logo on it from a garden centre that had closed two years ago: a tree with an impossible canopy made of tiny plastic leaves. The handles were stiff as regret.

He heard it then, faintly. Not a cockerel. No. He would have known that; his skin would have cringed and his stomach climbed his spine. This was the sound of many, many thin things rubbing, as if somewhere nearby a man had set himself a task of folding and refolding every bag he found, and had decided that folding was too tidy and refolding back to crumple was better. The noise lurked in the hedges, hissed in the verge. He could not tell if it came from one place or all.

From the bend above the path, a man came down with a fishing rod over his shoulder. He had a face that smudged when Ewan tried to pin it, like a chalkboard written on and wiped halfheartedly. He wore a cap with no badge. He shifted his rod to his other shoulder as he met Ewan and nodded. He looked past him at the bag by Ewan’s foot as if it were just a bag. His eyes were the colour of plastic when it’s white and thinks it's clear.

“You’ll watch the path,” Ewan said, surprising himself because he never addressed strangers first. The man said nothing for a heartbeat, then smiled in a way that did not advertise teeth and said, “Aye. Watch my path. Good night.” His accent was local and not local, a good copy a fraction too well rehearsed. He went on and the bag sound went with him.

Ewan picked up the garden centre bag and shoved it into the inside pocket of his coat. He regretted it as soon as he did it. He felt as if he had invited something rude into his jacket, and now it sat against his chest, whispering. He tried to shake it off. He walked home the long way, cutting across streets where the hedges were tidy. When he reached his front step he put his hand to the bag through the cloth and said, “Quiet, now.”

It did not quiet. All evening the bag talked. He set it on his table and wrote letters around it. He composed a line to his grandmother—if she had been alive; she wasn’t; she’d have told him to get over himself and get a thicker coat. He ate cold oatcakes. He stared at the bag and thought of the man with the fishing rod and eyes the colour of plastic. He eventually slept with his hand pressed to his stomach, and dreamed that he lay on a bed of leaves that were not leaves but the thin white ones printed to look like leaves, and that his breath fogged inside a clear sack, harmless and terrifying, and that somewhere, beyond a wall of crinkling, a rooster stood on a barrel and announced itself like a king.

Morning again. He placed the bag under the sink beside the compost bin, because that seemed like an insult to it and he liked to test the manners of things that had too much self-regard. He went to work. He mended a clock. He told the schoolboys that geometry was older and better than any of them, and that the triangles were not the problem; the problem was that they were boys. He took a call from Archie who said, “Ye hear any chat about folk putting bags in the river? Been complaints.” Archie was a bluff man who wore his hair like a helmet. He had been unkind to Ewan once in school, and boys who are unkind make men who think they are being kind when they are not.

“Bags,” Ewan said.

“Aye. Bags.” Archie snorted. “As if there’s not bins enough. Anyway, ye ken what folk are like.”

“I’ll keep an ear,” Ewan said, and hung up without meaning to be rude.

After lunch he took the bus toward Thainstone and got off two stops early. He walked among the half-abandoned retail spaces whose wildflower beds had availed themselves of the shadow of discount signage and turned vigorous. The old garden centre sat with its windows blank with dust and paper. The sign above the door was gone; the bolts showed out like missing teeth. Far off near the livestock mart there was a shout and the skitter of hooves, and nearer the wind wove itself into knots among the railings.

He walked round the back. There was a door with a flaking padlock. The padlock was not locked. He pushed, and the door took the push as an offense. He stepped inside into the smell of old fertilizer and newer plastic. The light came through the high panes thick with dirt. His eyes made scabs of it and rubbed them off.

It was not empty. That was not surprising. People left things in places they thought were empty. The surprising thing was the care. Piles of bags, folded like flags. Stacks of them, colour-coded: white, cream, half-transparent, blue letters, green letters, bags with special gussets, bags with handles knotted together to make long chains. On the floor chalk marks drew circles and inside the circles lay arrangements: a star of polypropelene weaving, a spiral of sandwich bags tight as a snail shell, a grid of crisp packets like armour for a small city. On the chalk someone had written names of winds. Southeasterly. Haar. That word he recognized: the sea mist that came up from nowhere on some summer mornings and put its clammy hands on your neck.

There were jars too. Not jam jars like his. Sterile glass, labelled with tidy pen: Aisle Whisper, Till Sleeze, Parking Lot Cry. A sample of the supermarket, bottled. When he held one, a slink of feeling went up his wrist. The writing was a little too neat, and that was how he knew the man's magic wasn’t good. True acts have smudged edges.

At the far end, near where the greenhouse had been, a chair faced a wall on which there were photographs taped. He went closer. They were ordinary pictures, none of them magical unless you felt what he did, that all ordinary things are magic if you are standing in a place that makes the skin thin. A shot of the river with sunlight on its wrinkled back. A disused lot where thistles had gone to white. A line of trolleys left out overnight. On the river picture someone had drawn in pen, not good pen but careful, circles where plastic gathers. On the trolley picture the word NEST had been written.

Ewan stood with his hands in his coat. He should not be here. He was in a man’s house, though the man paid no rent and invited no guests. He should not breathe this man’s air or read his handwriting.

The sound of bags rubbing went up mid-note as if its conductor had stepped onto his box and raised a baton. Ewan turned.

He did not see the man from the river. He saw something else: a structure like a curtain of carriers strung side by side, making a wall that moved because it did not understand truly what a wall does. Behind it a shadow. Behind the shadow someone’s breath. He never knew later why he did not run then. The fear of cockerel would have sent him if a rooster had raised its voice. But this was plastic. Plastic only rustles. Plastic does not crow.

“An’ what are you?” It was a question without the question mark. The voice came from behind the curtain. Ewan didn’t believe in dread naming, but he felt the pull of names as a river feels the tug of bridges. You say your own name, and you’re tied. You say the other’s name, and the knot’s in your fingers.

“Ewan,” he said anyway. Lies coil; truth often lies straight enough to look like flooring. “From the library.”

“Library,” the voice repeated, and the bags said the same, a little softer. “You must like quiet. Good for you. Quiet’s honest. Goes about its business. But people don’t respect quiet. They clutter it. They litter it. They pile their… their crap into nice quiet, and it’s up to someone to tidy. Isn’t it.” The last two words sighed around the room like a cleaning cloth.

The figure behind the curtain moved. Ewan saw, high up on the wall, a standard retail store clock. It ticked. It had a cracked plastic cover. He focused on the crack, on how it wobbled the second hand. He could always, if pressed, find a detail to live inside until the large shape passed by.

“My name is Blaise,” the voice said. It was not Blaise’s name in any permanent way. Names on true people have a way of moving around until they find the posture that suits them. This name sat uncomfortably on the man, as if he had borrowed it from a book and kept the receipt. “Blaise Carrid. I gather what is thrown away. I am diligent. Self-sufficient. Civic-minded.” He let each phrase ripple a little in the air like a banner of cellophane.

“You’re proud of using too many bags,” Ewan said, letting the sentence fall out before the part of him with caution could sharpen it. “That’s a… novelty.” He tried for light. The floor tried along with him and held his weight.

The curtain lifted, and there he was. Not smudged now. His face had lines a little too straight, as if someone had drawn in cheekbones but didn’t love them. His eyes were tired, which can make people kind or cruel. He wore a tidy shirt under a tidy jacket under which the pockets bulged. Each bulge rustled.

“Not proud,” Blaise said. “Obedient.” He lifted a pair of handles in his hand and let them dangle. “The world made these. They are here. They will not… depart. Men throw, wind fetches, river blends. Do you expect me to refuse the materials I am given? There’s a call. There is a call and it’s not the cockerels in fields.” He watched Ewan’s face change as if testing clay between his fingers. “I know you,” he added, softly. “The boy who can’t stand the morning. The boy who tells light it is not welcome above a certain volume. I always think of you when I hear that… horn.” He mimed a rooster’s beak with his hand. It was an ugly little motion, but it told Ewan enough. The man had been in town long enough to learn gossip from the way people look away, or he had seen Ewan by a fence once. Perhaps he had made inquiries. People speak without wanting to. They confess in the shells of words.

Ewan looked at the curtain of plastic and the chalk circles and the photographs clung to the wall like limpets kissing rock. He could say the following: stop. He could say the other following thing: teach me. He could ask, and think that asking would make a rope, and the rope with a tug would lead him out. But the man’s room hummed with wanting. It was a stuck kind of wanting, the worst kind—the kind that is so sure its own central feeling is duty that it cannot recognize appetite.

“People will come,” Ewan said instead. “With keys and torches and the right to pick up what is not theirs. If you leave it looking like this, they will come, and you will not be able to tell them an interesting story about wind. They won’t hear it.” He had the distinct sensation of being someone else’s tongue. He was speaking, but the words had the weight of a future that had already written a paragraph in someone else’s hand.

“Ah.” Blaise exhaled very slightly and tipped his head as if there was a draught under it. “You worry for me. Very librarian of you. Well. The river and I have an arrangement. It feeds me. I feed it. I take what men gave it and give it back when it asks in a better shape. I make nests for wind; wind loves me. I make long handles for river; river uses them for own devices. Nobody complains when swans use our reeds. Nobody cries out when crows weave twine into their beds. Why do they call me… villain? Eh?” He smiled then. It was tired, he was tired, but there was something behind it that was not tired at all. A wire. A hunger with reasons.

Ewan could have said: because you are lying. Because wind doesn’t love men named Blaise any more than it loves glass doors. Because the kind of giving you imagine is a theft with bows on. He did not say any of that because he did not know it yet as knowledge; he felt it as ache and itch.

“Don’t be here when the light goes,” Blaise said, and the wall of bags sighed a little in on itself, making a poor imitation of a curtain. “Hens go to roost. Men with harsh torches go to their vans. Midnight is full of professionals. Go home, Mr. Calder. We could talk again another time. Take whatever fancy photographs of leaves you like with your head. The building will not board up if I do not invite it. We can let time sit between us like a sofa. You on one end. Me in my sensible seat. We both insist we’re comfortable.”

Ewan put his hand in his coat pocket and touched one of his own knots. He thought of his grandmother again, then of how the sky over the hill went the colour of fish belly when mist came. He nodded. “I’ll go,” he said, and stepped out past the curtain, which touched his shoulder and gave him a static lick that lifted the hair on his arm under his sleeve.

Outside, the light looked both thinner and more polite, as if it had heard someone say it was unwanted and had resolved to behave. He walked back along the edge of the car park where grass had come up and made optimistic little nations between lines of tarmac. He thought of how Blaise had said his name. He thought of the photograph of trolleys and how the word NEST made them look like a family. Sabotage loves to look familial. He looked toward Thainstone; he could see the silver of the marts’ roofs and, beyond them, the polite teeth of the bypass. He heard a far crow.

He had to stop. He put his hand flat on the bonnet of an abandoned Land Rover and breathed like a diver who forgot he had gills. The crowing was not even close, but it found him all the same. The air tightened. My magic hates this sound, he thought, and then his magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, said back, No, it doesn’t. It hates what you think it means. It was an unkind answer. He stood until the quiet lapped back in.

When he reached his own door, there was a note under the mat.

Ewan,

— if this is the right cottage, if it is not, apologies to whomever reads it — I am down at the allotments this evening at six. There’s a matter of… let’s call it community tidiness. Archie says I shouldn’t bother ye. Archie is often wrong.

Mhairi Latch

He didn’t breathe again for two breaths. Mhairi Latch had been his grandmother’s friend and her particular enemy when they were fifteen. They fell out, moved on, fell back, like two dogs who love in their precise brutal way. Mhairi had taught him that you can make a charm out of a rowan twig and a compliment said under your breath to the person you least wished well. He had not seen her in months. When the old hands retire they do not go to Spain; they go behind hedges and watch.

He went. The allotments were wind-chapped. The bean poles were like a village of thin people saying their prayers. Mhairi was there in her cardy, her scarf knotted under her chin, kneeling as if she were making offerings to a deity of her own vegetables. He did not know why he had thought for a second she might be gone; the woman had buried two husbands, three dogs and five ugly roses and remained herself like granite remains itself through the ages.

“Ye took your time,” she said when he came to her. “I ken ye, lad. Ye think yourself going unseen like cloud. Clouds are the most seen things going.”

He took off his cap and bent to kiss the air near her cheek because she never liked the feel of faces doing that. “Mhairi.”

“Moira tells me ye’ve got one of the Bagman’s messes at your house.”

Ewan did not ask how she knew. Things rot in gardens and go sweet again. Information does the same. “Under the sink.”

“Aye. That’s as good a place as any. He likes bearings.” She looked at the soil. “Ye’ve seen him?”

“I think so. He told me his name. Blaise.”

“Wrong,” she said immediately. The spade chopped the earth. “That’s not his name. But he’d like ye ta think it is. He says a thing and covers it with another thing and calls it care. He uses too many of everything, not just bags. Too many reasons. Too many excuses. Too many noises. Men like that, ye don’t push. Ye don’t resist either. Ye stand and watch till they walk into their own hole.”

“I could stop—”

“Ach, laddie. Men who tangle the world’s leavings and make them sing in key think they can mop up a whole river with a towel. They believe their hands are bigger than they are. They go home with their hands stinging. They like the sting. If ye go to them with a broom, they’ll make you into a brush.” She looked up at him then, and her eyes were knives. “Why are yae shaking?”

He had not noticed his hands. He looked. “I heard… one.”

“Bird?”

He nodded. She made a face. “Cockerels are fools. So are the folk who keep em outside town where they dinna belong. But mark me. They tell truths. They say, Morning’s here. Ye cannae bury the morning under a rug, Ewan. Ye can draw little lines of magic across it, aye, ye can, and it’ll still step over and be day.”

“I know.” He thought of how Blaise had mimed the rooster with his hand, that little ugly pecking motion made to hurt more than to entertain. His stomach turned the way dogs do tight circles before they settle. “He’s doing something with the bags. Not only… untidy things. He’s making structures. He’s naming winds. He—”

“Went to school somewhere he thought was grand,” Mhairi said dryly. “Thinkers who never touched a real dirty thing love to think of how wonderful dirt is.” She stood up with a groan you could stitch a sack with. “We’ll walk. We’ll look at his wind. We’ll look at what wind sees.”

They went along the ditch. The sky had ridged itself like long muscle. Mhairi walked with her stick in the way of women who know exactly how hard ground is, which is very. They did not talk until they got to the place where the hedgerow turned and made a shy corner. There, caught on a hawthorn, was a net. Not rope, no twine. Bags plaited into bags, simple, elegant in its ugliness. It had faceted itself into something almost beautiful, and that was perhaps its worst offense. It had held a pheasant, which was all bones and feathers. The bones were gone now; just a fan of brown and green feathers remained, stuck on a prickle. Ewan made a noise without its own noun, and Mhairi put her hand on the net as if introducing herself to it at a funeral.

“Ye’ll expose him,” she said calmly, as if reading it somewhere he couldn’t see. “He’ll go behind bars. That last is not our doing. That last is the job for Archie and the men with clipboards and the men who like to type. But before that he’ll be at his most interesting. They always are, the moment before they are caught. They think themselves either safest or cleverest; both make good theatre. Ye’ll be there, because ye’re daft that way.” She looked at him, and the pity in her face didn’t soften it. It made it harder. “And you’re brave, which is not the same thing as not being afeart. Afeart’s a good start. The heart that knows what fright is, that heart can bite.”

“It’s so…” He groped. “Human,” he finished. “The way it moves. The way it wants to be wanted.”

“Aye,” she said. “All human rubbish is human. That’s the curse.”

When he went home there was a cockerel standing on his gatepost.

He stopped where he was. Its head turned. Its eye was a button. Buttons are innocent and also not. He could not say why there would be a cockerel here, in a row of cottages where the covenants said no poultry and no midnight drumming. It shook its feathers and did not crow. He thanked it without moving for its restraint. It tilted its head further as if listening for that thanks, and in the splashed light on its neck the colours were too splendid. The world does that sometimes, sweetening the thing you fear. He felt it examine him. He let it. His palms were slick.

From the hedge, a bag lifted and put itself down again, as if too shy to wave.

“I see,” he said, and he did. Blaise would be the sort to use every part of a town’s habits. If his spells made the wind hop at his command and the river bring him offerings, what would he not recruit? Birds were easy. They bore messages for those who wanted messages to be the kind that came with claws. He took off his cap and held it in both hands. He did not bow. He did not speak a charm, because he understood suddenly that charm was not for this. This needed something else. He thought for a long moment, then added, in his ordinary voice, “You’re very handsome. I wish you a good evening. Please go.”

The rooster blinked. Things often work at the point where you don’t expect them to because you didn’t draw a big circle round your expectation. The bird scratched once, turned, hopped off the post, and went, with all the rude grace of a creature who gives no respect to concepts, into the lane. The bag in the hedge settled.

He went inside. He put his hands in the sink under the cold tap and left them there until they hurt so well that the thought of another kind of hurt couldn’t fit. He took the bag from under the sink and laid it on the table. He cut it into seven pieces, not with scissors but with a knife of words his grandmother had taught him that had never needed sharpening. He folded the pieces and set one under each leg of the table and the chair and under the door and the window and gave the seventh to the fire. The pieces did not smoke. They did not stink. He slept, and it was the first night in two days that the plastic in the air did not whisper him awake with its thousand unused syllables.

In the morning he called Archie.

“I have a thing,” he said, not knowing yet which word he would pick for it. “A… situation.”

“Ye always say that when you’ve found a cat,” Archie grumbled.

“It’s not a cat. It’s a man with a store.”

“Is it a legal store?”

“No.”

“Right. Where.”

Ewan told him. He did not tell him about the jars, the chalk, the way the curtain made a joke of walls. He did not tell him about the way Blaise had put his hand to his beak like a boy. He told him enough to get Archie’s boots to the place and his lads behind. His voice was steady. It went across the phone line and did not snag.

“Ye’ll be there?” Archie said, too casual.

“I read the papers.” The dodge. The old dodge that had gotten him away from questions since he was twelve.

“Ye’ll be there. Ye should be there. Bloody witness is another word for problem, did ye ken?” Archie hung up sounding irritated, which had always meant—Ewan had learned this the hard way—that he cared.

He put on his coat, tucked charms in odd places, then took them out again and left them on the table. He stood and looked at Bennachie through the window—the hill with its shoulders shrugged against a sky that would make all its usual promises and break only the ones it did not know it had made—and went out. The light was too honest to do anyone’s lying for them; that would come later. He walked, and the wind, obliging, brought him the city’s new music: rustle-rustle, whisper-whisper, bag bag bag, as if a crowd had learned a new word and liked the shape it made in their mouths and would say it as many times as possible before they were told to hush.

On the corner by the bus stop, Moira raised her hand. “Ewan! Archie’s looking for ye.”

“He’ll find me,” Ewan said, an odd voice. He had the sensation that time had split. In one time he went about his day and came home with salt on his boots. In another time he would not come home the same. He stepped around the cockerel on the post that was no longer there but would always, in a way, be.

In the co-op window there was a sign: please re-use your carrier bags. Below it, someone had scrawled, in black, please. The second please was badly shaped, but it looked more like a prayer. He hoped prayers like that counted. He hoped someone, somewhere, was counting. He thought of Mhairi’s knife eyes and Blaise’s tidied jacket and the way wind really sounds when it’s willing to show you its inside, and he walked, picking his way on the pavement that knows more of feet than any oracle. There is always a meeting. He went to his.Chapter 3

Archie’s van was a rectangle of determination squatting under the by-pass, light bars cold on top, dirt caked on the wheel arches like consequence. Two other vans had come—council lads with grabbers and heavy gloves, and the police car that smelled of coffee and rain even before you got near it. Ewan felt their purpose the way you feel a storm before it rounds the hill. He slowed his step without meaning to. His feet knew this was a hinge hour, and feet get to vote even if you think you’re running the meeting.

Archie saw him and rolled his shoulders to look taller. He wore authority like he wore his orange vest: obvious, a bit too bright, but it kept you safe in traffic. “Right, Calder,” he called, not unkind. “Ye’ve the key, aye?”

“There wasn’t a lock,” Ewan said. He lifted his hand, palm upward, a bodily shrug that said he hadn’t come to lead anything. “Back door opens if you push it as if you’re apologizing.”

“Aye, well,” Archie muttered, “we’ll push like we mean it.” He glanced at PC Lyle, a tidy woman with hair pulled to a point at the back of her head and eyes like new pennies. She didn’t look much older than the schoolboys who swore at triangles, but her posture said she was paid to do this and also born to. “We’ll keep it calm,” she said, to no one and everyone. “If he’s there, we talk first. If he’s not there, we document. No drama.”

Mhairi had come without being asked, as she had always come to any place there might be a use for her noticing. She had a basket over her arm, the sort you see in old pictures of women with heads for market arithmetic. She nodded at Ewan and then at Archie as if distributing points. “No one touches anything wi bare hands,” she announced, as if hired to consult. “No one stands where wind can push ye without ye knowing. If there’s jars, leave em be unless ye ken your jar-magic from your elbow.”

“Who invited the knitting circle?” one of the council lads muttered, and Mhairi turned her head very slightly. The lad colored in a way that suggested he’d been an altar boy once and still recognized certain kinds of holiness.

They walked the side of the shuttered units, past the place where purple loosestrife had exploited a crack and made itself queen of an island of gravel. The old garden centre sat with its mouth shut, paper scabbed on the windows and an advertisement for compost so faded it looked like a watercolor of rot. Archie reached the door with his competent big-man walk, put his hand to the padlock and found, as Ewan had, that locks are for people who believe every box must have a lid. The chain dropped with a complaining noise. He pushed and the door breathed plastic.

The rustling rose. It was a choir and a tide and a thousand dresses in a thousand changing rooms deciding whether they fit. The men paused as if the noise were a dog you had to let sniff you before you reached out a hand. Ewan stepped to the side, where the shadow held a bit richer, and put his palm to the cool flake of wall just to tell it he was here and had come to mind the place too. He didn’t love these acts of forgetting—entering and making inventory of another’s life—but sometimes the world’s lungs get clogged and you bring hot water and you do what you do and call it mercy.

Inside the light was again that dirt-sieved softness, and the arrangements were as he’d seen them but altered with a care that knew it was being watched. The curtain of carriers hung like a drawn breath you weren’t allowed to let out yet. The chalk circles had been swept once, briskly, so that their edges blurred into the concrete like thought into sleep. On the wall the photographs had multiplied and now there were phrases written around them in a regular hand: COLLECTING IS CARE. TIDY IS LOVE. The statements sat like labels under museum glasswork, inviting your conscience to nod.

“Guid God,” Archie breathed. “He’s daft.”

“Daft’s a tool,” Mhairi said. “Plenty use it to make a point sharp.” She put the basket down and took out gloves, the pink fairy-liquid sort that looked ridiculous on her and did not make her less dangerous. She passed a pair to Ewan. “On.”

PC Lyle’s radio muttered and then calmed. She stepped forward until she was the person at the hinge point and spoke into the room as if the room had ears that wanted to be used, which it did. “Sir,” she said, voice even, carrying. “Blaise Carrid? Anyone? This is the police. We’re here to discuss reports and to ensure nobody’s hurt. We’d like a chat.”

The curtain moved. Not like a stage curtain drawn back to reveal, not theatrically; rather like a skin that had changed its mind and decided to be a door. It parted just enough to put a person through and then closed because that was its habit. Blaise came out in his tidy jacket and his tired eyes that, close up, were paler than was good for anyone. He held a jar in one hand with care as if it were a baby’s head. In the other hand his fingers pinched a pair of bag handles as if for reassurance.

“Officer,” he said, and his voice went to a scraping gentleness. “Welcome. Have you brought your litter picks? I find I never have enough hands.”

Archie made a noise that had a swear in it in all but the letters. PC Lyle shifted her weight in the way of a person prepared to be colossally patient and also to turn into a lighthouse if needed. “We’ve had complaints,” she said. “About obstructions. About traps. About… installations in public pathways. About harm to wildlife. We need a look round and a discussion of what’s yours and what’s not yours to keep.”

“Everything is mine that everyone else throws away,” Blaise said. He smiled in a manner that tried for reasonable and landed just past the mark. “I am your bin. I am your conscience made busy. I am what the council would be if the council had a heart. Look how I have made it neat.” He gestured and the bag wall rustled as if applauding.

“Ye’re catching birds,” Archie snapped. “That’s all the neat ye need to ken.” He jerked his chin at the curtain. “What’s behind?”

“My thoughts,” Blaise said, softening his mouth into sympathy for his own joke. He looked at Ewan then, as if they had a private conversation waiting to be resumed. “Mr. Calder. I’m glad you came. Librarians are the proper audience for any man’s archive.”

“You’re not an archive,” Ewan said. He didn’t know he was going to say it; the sentence had been sitting in him, a pebble ready for tongue. “You’re a blockage pretending to be a collection. Archives know the future will need a path through. You’re making a maze because you like watching people try the wrong way first.”

Blaise’s eyes held him for a beat that pinched exactly where embarrassment and satisfaction meet. He lifted the jar a little in a gesture of toast. “A fair speech. Would you like to hear my wind?” He held the jar up for the room like a priest might hold a wafer. The label read in that clean hand: HAAR, BOUGHT AND PAID. He twisted the lid. A smell came out like wet paper and salt, and along with it a sound too small to measure until it passed your ear and suddenly you knew you’d heard it all your life when mornings went white. The edges of the room softened. Concrete went a shade like milk that’s just realized it is no longer in the cow. Archie swore properly this time. The council lads swore too, but quieter, as if sound itself had thickened.

Ewan felt the pressure the sound made not on his eardrum so much as on the little hairs of his arms. He watched the jar. He watched Blaise’s hand on the lid and understood he had been honest the last time in one small thing: he did not have patience for smallness. The twist of the lid, the press of the thumb to make the seal break, the care of the tongue of tin as it unrolled—Blaise liked the big act in those tiny acts. He liked a scale model of power.

“Stop that,” PC Lyle said, calm as the inside of a teacup. “We’re here to secure an unsafe site and arrest if necessary. Mr. Carrid, I’m going to ask you to place the container on the table and step back. We can talk about what you think you’re doing with the river, but we’ll do it without tricks.”

“Tricks,” Blaise repeated, tasting the word to see if it had any sugar left. “No. Not tricks. Remedies. Palliatives. You might say a cream on a rash. Your wind complains to me, Officer. It says, ‘Men have poked holes in me and called it clean living.’ It says, ‘I carry your bright suffering to the hedgerows and hold it there like I am paid to hold.’ I give wind comfort. I give wind a way to be beautiful again.”

Mhairi took a step, which was really three steps and the history of her ankles, and placed herself very gently beside the table with the jars. Her hands went nowhere near them. She looked at Blaise the way a wall looks at ivy. “Ye’re hurting things,” she said. There were words that belonged to court and council minutes and she did not bother with them. “Ye’re hurting things and that’s not all right. Ye say beautiful as if it were a word that belonged to ye. Beauty does not cover blood.”

Blaise’s face pinched then. For a moment, the neatness went, and what was under it looked raw and underfed. “I’m tidying,” he said. It had the weight of a plea and the edge of threat. “No one thanks a man for tidying. But afterwards they look around and they think the world is better behaved somehow, and they never think why. I gather. I keep. I make uses. I tell wind where to sleep and water where to lay down its cargo. I make nests for the plastic birds, Miss—”

“Mhairi Latch,” she said briskly, because withholding a name is sometimes power and sometimes pettiness and she picked generosity as the sharper blade. “An’ ye dinna get ta call me Miss as if that made me a decoration in your speech.” She looked at the curtain. “What ye built is moving wrong. It’s trying to make itself into a sea with a skin. Seas dinna like skins. Do ye ken how many wee lives live in a thread o water at the edge o that car park? Ye’re blocking them with your good intentions.”

A sound came from the far side of the curtain. Not wind. Not bag. Not man. A shuffle and a startle. PC Lyle’s head turned the way a cat’s does when it knows there’s a mouse under the board. “Sir,” she called, louder. “If there’s anyone else in there, come out. Now, please.”

The curtain shifted in a slow pulse and then parted enough to spit out a boy. He was fourteen by his bones and seventeen by his mouth and six by his eyes, which were very large in a ghastly way. He had the look of someone who has breathed recirculated air too long and now can’t remember if air can be got in other ways. His hoodie bore a school crest in the same way a pond bears summer pollen. He clutched a chain of knotted handles and did not seem to know his hand was doing it. “He said we were doing good,” he said, politeness still clinging to him like sugar. “He said it was art. He said it’d stop the birds choakin.” He looked at Mhairi the way boys look at women who have never betrayed them. “Was that wrong?”

“Nae your wrong,” Mhairi said. She moved like the ground moving under snow. She put her hand on the chain, and her glove creaked. “Ye go outside with the officer now and get a drink. Ye say, ‘I was there, I dinna ken why,’ and ye say your mam’s name three times. That’ll set your heart to its true size again.”

PC Lyle, to her credit, did not snort at the order about names. She stepped to the boy and took him as if he had come to her because he liked her, not because a lot of adults had given him no choice. They went to the door and light lay on them briefly like a blessing.

Archie rubbed his neck. “Christ alive. He’s got bairns in here, Calder. I thought this was just one of those loners who mutter in the post office queue.”

“He’s never been alone a day in his life,” Ewan said. The words surprised him with their authority. He had been alone the particular way that means you can hear certain voices. Blaise’s voice snagged him because it was pitched to end up inside men like him.

Blaise smiled at him again because he could not let anything be said without wanting to own it. “Children are better at civic spirit than you think,” he said. “They believe in rules, if you tell them rules are a kind of kindness. They believe in gleaning. They like to be on a team that is praised by the sky. They have not yet been told that cleaning is women’s work and unbeautiful, and so they bring me the bits you leave in your hedges and I make their efforts matter.”

“You make yourself matter to yourself,” Ewan said. He wanted not to be roused to point-scoring, but here they were, two men, and logic never saved men from themselves. “The rest is arras.”

“Arras,” Blaise said, pleased with the medievalism and the way it made his mouth feel. “Yes. Curtains. Hides and reveals. We do love a reveal. For example.” He put his hand in the bulge of his jacket and brought out a small device, one of those cheap plastic boxes you buy to make a noise on a farm gate when foxes come. He pressed it and the box crowed.

It was a poor crow. It was tinny, a parody, more door than bird. It was also enough. Ewan had time to think, It’s not the sound, it’s what I think it means, and then the hinge opened in him and all his careful ties loosened. The jars on the table hummed. The curtain made an encouraging sound as if for a child taking its first step. Bags along the wall lifted their handles as if they had been given rehearsal instructions.

He put his hand out blindly and found, absurdly, the old retail clock. The second hand ticked. He held it with his palm and felt the rude time of shops—a fast, restful measure—run into his skin. He took a breath. He made himself shape it into a softer thing than panic. He heard his grandmother say, You can’t stop the rooster saying his say, you can only make promises about what you’ll do when he’s done. He made himself remember the bowl. He made himself remember three seconds.

He had no bowl, which was maybe a mercy because bowls had failed him. He had his mouth. He breathed out, a tiny steadying stream, and on that breath he laid his spell like dust on a mantel. It was not a hex or a ban. It was a promise. He said, just under hearing and not at all under hope, “I will see what I need to see and stop. And then start. And then stop. And start again.”

In that sliver of calm the crowing was ridiculous rather than monumental, and the room knew the difference. The jars dimmed a fraction. The curtain faltered. Blaise’s finger on the button pressed harder as if pressing harder had ever taught a machine more meaning.

Archie, who started life as a boy who hit things until they broke and had become a man who now knew how not to, raised his hand in the way he did when stopping traffic and said to his crew, “Cut the strings.” He wasn’t looking at the bag handles. He was looking at the lines where Blaise’s installations met the anchor points—the bits tied to the metal shelf uprights, to the window struts, to the nailed-down tables. He’d done enough festivals and fair days to know that if you unhook the points, the bunting falls without fuss.

The lads waded toward the curtain in their gloves, and the curtain, affronted, tried to be clever. It flexed and made a pouch and tried to cup a man. It went rigid and tried to become a wall. It failed at being anything but itself, which was embarrassing to watch. Mhairi put the flat of her hand under the nearest fluorescent tube and its squeal, which had been rising in the noise like a violin in a nervous orchestra, flattened obediently. “We’re not at your concert, son,” she told the light. “Ye’ve had your turn.”

Blaise moved then, quick, the way men do when a plan has gone from being a beautiful concept to being a thing that has to dodge boots. He snapped another jar’s lid—the label said PARKING LOT CRY—and for an instant everyone smelled petrol and lonely. Outside, a gull shouted the sort of laugh that makes you doubt your pride. He lifted his bag-handles rope like a whip and swung it. The rope hit Archie’s arm, and for a second it stuck, not glue, not magic like the stories tell; static, the sort that raises your hair and makes your teeth remember tin foil. Archie swore and shook his arm and the stuckness went and left a memory.

“All right, Mr. Carrid,” PC Lyle said, and the tea-cup calm turned to ceramic you could break a head with. She put her hand to her belt and pulled from it not a truncheon, not a gun, just a pair of scissors, the sort you use for casualty tape. She held them up so he could see. “We will be cutting your ties,” she said. “We will be cutting your access. We will be cutting off your… air.” She didn’t look at Ewan, but he felt as if she had set him an exercise in the proper use of the word hinge.

Ewan moved along the wall towards the photographs because the photographs were the place where Blaise’s wanting had to make marks you could read. Among the river circles and trolley lines, one image had been added. It was Bennachie, drawn badly with felt-tip, a child’s profile of a hill with ears. Across the summit someone had written: COCKPIT. He made a noise of his own, the kind you make when someone has put a grubby thumb on your best plate.

He reached under the table for the charm he’d felt the last time and found not his own card under cardboard, but something Blaise had fixed there: a twist of grey plastic like a nest with a pebble in it. He held it. It thrummed. He thought, He’s made himself a cockerel. He’s made himself a morning he controls. He felt anger in him rise the way bread rises, swelling and fragrant and not helpful if not punched down. He remembered the co-op sign: please re-use your carrier bags. The second please like a prayer. He looked at the pebble. He breathed on it. He said, simple as the label on the jar and truer, “Please stop.”

Sometimes that is the whole spell. Not often, because the world is large and polite does not always move it. But if you say Please to a thing that has been used for too many not-pleases, sometimes the thing sighs. The thrumming eased. He put the cheap nest back under the cardboard where it would have to content itself with wincing at feet above. He stood again and saw that Blaise’s hand had shifted towards the door as if to find a path. He said, because men who make mazes often forget that other men see them too, “Don’t run. You’ll make it worse.”

“Worse for whom?” Blaise snapped. He seemed thinner in the light. The jars on the table sat sullenly. The curtain had lost any pretense to being a wall and slumped, half-fallen, two council lads picking it apart like a knitting disaster. He gripped his sound box. “You don’t understand morning, Mr. Calder. You never did. You think it’s a thing that happens to you. It’s a structure. It’s a song you can teach. I have made a morning that doesn’t hurt.” He lifted the little crow machine and pressed it until it buzzed. It made, this time, a sound so sad and so cheap that even his own installation went embarrassed and refused to answer.

“You’ve made a morning that won’t tell the truth,” Ewan said. He felt the hinge in him and did not flinch this once. “I need the hurt to know where I am. You need it too, or you wouldn’t be fighting it so hard.” He stepped toward him. He did not raise his hand because men who raise hands in rooms like this knock things that shouldn’t be knocked. He said, in the voice he used to quiet lights and Bollinger swans in the park and laddies with triangles, “Enough.”

It was not magic any more than saying a name well is magic. It was deciding that a certain run of the world stops at your tongue. It can be the height of arrogance. It can also be a duty like tightening a jar for someone whose fingers are swollen. Blaise flinched. PC Lyle’s patience had done the necessary creeping and turned in its neat shoes into action. She moved and laid a hand on his wrist and the bag-rope fell to the floor like a pet that has given up on being taken seriously. Archie stepped in with the other hand, and between them Blaise stood very still, as if he had come to the edge of a pond and suddenly seen his face in it and not liked, unexpectedly, how tired he looked.

They cuffed him, in the soft way for men not drunk and not swinging. He watched Ewan the whole time as if wanting to believe he had been misunderstood. “It’s not crime,” he said, not to the officer or the orange jacket. “It’s care. I have been so careful.”

Ewan wanted very much to say, I know. He did not say it because there are kindnesses that tie the wrong knots. He bent instead and put his palms to his knees and looked at the floor until the tremor that had danced in his fingers took itself elsewhere.

Outside, the wind had its own ideas and was making them known around the lip of the unit roofs. Bags in the hedges lifted their handles, hopeful, and then went down again because hope is tiring. PC Lyle led Blaise out with a light hand. The boy was on the kerb with a carton of juice a council lad had found in a box—the box said MILK on the side as if anything in this world stayed what you named it. He looked at Blaise with a betrayal that wasn’t his own, and then at Ewan, and then at nothing, which was sometimes the kindest place to look.

“Right,” Archie said, brisk, as if time had tugged his sleeve and reminded him it had other children to attend to. “We’ll tape up, we’ll get a proper team for the inventory. Lads, leave the jars. If anyone’s daft enough to open one, I want it ta be at the station where we can blame the chief.” He clapped Ewan on the shoulder in a way that acknowledged there was a shoulder there that had done something and that he had noticed. “Ye did fine,” he said, and then, because compliments make his mouth itch, “Ye looked sick as a dug for a minute.”

“I was,” Ewan said. He straightened. The light outside had gone the colour of thin tea. Bennachie lay behind the retail units as solid as irony. The harebelles in a crack by the loading bay nodded as if they agreed with him. “It’ll be worse later,” he added, and wasn’t sure if he meant for Blaise or himself or the bags that now had no conductor. He touched his own coat pockets and found, as he always did, nothing in there that would pass for courage if measured by others, only the tatters of what kept his hands from loving too much the idea of closing.

Mhairi had been going around in the background like a quiet parent, undoing small knots and making small notes. She came to him when the vans had shut their doors and the police car had closed the bag of its man and was sitting with its engine purring indecisively. “It’s not done,” she said, because her gift had always been not letting anyone think the third act had lasted more than ten lines. “He’ll have other corners. Magic loves corners. He’ll have made friends with wind that canna be unfriended with paperwork. Ye’ll be needed to walk around this town and tell it itself again.”

“I can do that,” he said, knowing it would not really be a thing he did but a thing he joined in with all the other old women and lads and stony hills and Handel-singing daft roosters and light bulbs and rivers. He rubbed his fingers as if washing them without water. “The rooster,” he said then, helplessly. “He pressed a box and it— It shouldn’t— It’s—”

“Aye,” she said. “It’s all just a shape. Ye made another shape. Ye’ll do it again. Ye dinna get rid of what frightens ye by throwing it away. Ye turn it ta a shelf in your kitchen where it bides and holds tea towels.” She looked at the sky and made a noise that might once have been a laugh. “An’ then, when ye’re feeling very clever, it’ll jump down and crow in your cupboard.”

“Comforting,” he said, and she grinned at him with her ruined teeth and made him feel the right kind of small.

They walked away from the building. The wind came busy around the corners and discovered there was less to knock now. It tried to lift a chain of bags that had fallen by the door and failed. Across the road a woman coming out of the co-op carried a bought bag, the sturdy kind you pay a pound for and feel virtuous about. She had oranges in it. The bag sat well on her hip like a child. You could see the uses. You could see the lie sitting next to the use and choosing not to speak.

By the allotments, Moira was at her plot putting in a row of something not yet herself. She looked up when they passed and lifted a muddy glove. “Did ye?” she asked, and Ewan, who had never felt that good at plain answers, gave her one.

“We did,” he said. “For now.”

“For now’s a feast,” she said, approving. “Ye’ll be back at t’library later? There’s a lad will want that birth notice ye found.”

“I’ll put it aside.” He started to turn and then paused. He took two steps back. “Did you ever see a cockerel with a plastic tag on its foot?” he asked, a question that had percolated up from some sunk corner of him.

Moira squinted. “On wee bits farms, aye, they tie foolish things to birds. Ye’re no meaning one o yon numbers for fancy breedin? My uncle glued a wee sat-nav to a pigeon once; it went to Forres and stayed. Why?”

“No reason,” he said, and meant the opposite, but there was a limit to how many reasons a morning would hold without splitting.

He made his way home by the path that skirted the river and gave the water its say. It spoke in the old dirty manners of rivers, dragging itself over stones and pretending it had never been in a jar. On the bank a bag was snagged that had printed on it a drawing of a tree and a promise of carbon offsets, vaguely religious. He stooped. He shook his hand once, sharply, the way his grandmother had taught, and the bag went to sugar and fell like blessing or ash.

In his kitchen he put the kettle on because you could always do that. He took the pieces he had cut the night before from under the legs of table and chair and window and door, because they had served, and he burned them and said nothing over them. The smoke the plastic did not make was the kind of miracle no one writes down.

At the library, the third light flickered as he came in and steadied as if it had heard news. The old woman with hands like paper sat by the window, not reading. He went to her and said, because courtesy is a charm, “Good afternoon, Mrs. Bruce. Will the light do for ye?” and she said, “It will if it’s told to,” and he put his palm under it as you do under the chin of a small dog.

The schoolboys came at four and swore at triangles with zest. He told them triangles were older and more patient than any of them, and they agreed to disagree with handsome sinners’ smiles. The births column gave up a tiny name under G, and Ewan put the note in an envelope and wrote on the front, for Moira’s Hatton lad with cold hands and a granny who worries. He went to the back door at closing and stood in the alley, listening for bags, and heard only the ordinary rustle of the day putting itself back into drawers.

At dusk he took the long way home by the sign where the scarf hung and looked at Bennachie. The hill was unbothered. It doesn’t get paid to be bothered. It held the sky up at the place where sky would have sagged if left to itself, and it did not notice the compliment; that’s the way with hills. He breathed. The air tasted of damp cardboard and a little garden smoke and the metal of the bypass. Somewhere a bird made the small contented noise birds make when they’ve found the exact twig that suits the evening they’re having. He stood as still as a door that knows it is sometimes a window, and for the whole length of three long breaths he did not imagine a crow. Then he went in and shut the normal door that was a door and put his palm to it once, just once, as if doors needed to be told they were doing very well.

When he woke at three, which he always did, the night lay on him like a coat that fit, and he listened to the wind test the corners of the cottage and found it did not say bag bag bag. It said, in the old way, I was here before you and I will be after, and you can borrow me for your walking. He whispered three names and the folded line of the Don’s course, out of habit and out of love. He closed his eyes and did not see a bowl and did not see a cockerel and did not tumble infinite. He slept again like a man who had been to a meeting and come away with less plastic in his lungs.

In the morning there was a letter through his door without a stamp, very tidy, black ink, straight lines. He made tea and opened it and read, Ewan Calder—since names are bridges—thank you for your visit. They say I am Blaise. I will be called other things now. You may rest easy; I have no desire to crow. But we are not finished, because wind, as you know, makes a habit of the gaps under doors. I left, in goodwill and as proof of courtesy, a jar for you. It is outside in the hedge to the left if you stand facing Bennachie. It is labeled, as true things are. You will have to decide whether to open it. If you do, you will hear something you have mistaken all your life for cruelty. If you do not, you will live and die in sound’s shadow. Consider this my apology and my boast both. Kindly, B.

He set the letter down. He did not move for a while because standing very still is also a movement. Then he went out and to the left and looked at the hedge. The jar sat in the branches like a huge cold berry. The label was neat and he hated it. He took it in his hand. It was heavier than it should be. On it, in Blaise’s tidy letters, was written: COCKSPUR.

He held it. He did not open it. He stood in his small lane where the morning was becoming the day and the day would do its shopping and the wind would go to the co-op and buy a little rustle and put it in its pocket. He held Blaise’s jar and he held himself, and he did not hurry because you should not hurry a hinge. He went back inside and put the jar on the table, and for once he did not speak to the cottage because there are times you keep your counsel even with the things you love. He made tea. He stood in front of the Jar as if in front of a man and said, “Please,” once. He did not know to whom the please belonged, and that seemed only fair.Chapter 5

He stood a long time with the jar between his elbows and the kettle thinking itself toward noise. The label peered up at him with a small arrogance because tidy handwriting often does, and the word sat there like a thorn the paper had grown: COCKSPUR. He could have opened it there on the table as if he were a man making jam social. He could have heated a knife and slipped it under the lid to startle the seal without the little shriek lids made. He could have put it in the bin, the plain coward’s sacrament, and then all day listened to the phantom of it tell him what it had been. He did none of those. He made his tea and drank half standing, which he never did, then put the jar in his coat, not inside to his heart where it might talk to bones, but in the outside pocket where a nail had once worn a worry and he had mended it with invisible thread. It sat there and made no sound because jars are not obliged to warn you what they are holding.

He took the long way to the allotments. The light came across the roofs with the kind of reluctant kindness the north does so well. The lanes had been beaten tidy by cars, and at their edges the dandelions were doing sums with themselves and finding that one head becomes a hundred without asking permission. At the first corner a handful of bags had collected like pensioners, set their backs to the hedge and talked quietly of wind in the tone of those who intend to outlive it. He shook his fingers at them by habit and they did their old-sugar trick, a snowfall of brittle that is not winter. A man pushing a buggy looked at him as if to put him in a box that read odd, and he let himself go in that box because it had more air than the one that read mad.

Mhairi had a saucepan on at the allotment gate, not for food, but for the comfort of something boiling where you could see it. The smell was not soup. It was rowan and vinegar and a little iron. She had a stick bound with red thread, and her scarf today had cherries on it as if to taunt any gods within reach with the thought of summer.

“Aye,” she said, taking him in like weather. “Did ye sleep?”

“I did,” he said. “The jar came with a letter. He thanks me. He boasts. He does both like a man thinking himself born for a dais.” He pulled the jar from his pocket and put it on her paling table as if setting a baby down where all hands could see it.

She looked and made a small unhappy mouth. “He’s tidy,” she said. “There’s folk who clean to make space. An’ there’s folk who clean so their head can sit without making mess. Ye can tell which by their labels.” She tapped the word with a knuckle. “Cockspur. He’s a one for word games. He kens that the hawthorn that catches your coat is called that. He kens that cocks have spurs that draw blood and make men applaud in places I dinna go. He kens three meanings and hopes ye’ll do his fourth for him: he hopes ye’ll think fate.”

“I think invitation,” Ewan said. He didn’t know until he said it that this had been the word he’d been holding under his tongue, making it soft.

“That too.” She took the stick and touched the red twine. “We’ll do it by the water. Ye dinna open jars of a man’s temper under cabbages. They’ve their own moods without ye adding.”

They walked down past the bean poles and the beds where lettuces lay like little green hearts. At the corner the hawthorn—cockspur, the old women called it when it snagged your stockings—had gone sugary with blossom and now was going brown at the edges in a way that was both defeat and promise. Mhairi pinched a thorn and tugged. It let go because it knew her. She wound the thorn into the red on the stick until the thread and spike made a thought together. “Right,” she said. “We’ll go to the bend.”

At the Bass the Don behaved well for once; it moved as if it had somewhere useful to be and lacked the energy to preen. The willow dripped the way old willows do when they’ve given up on the idea of being anything other than explanation. Underneath, on the little bit of half-mud half-sand, a child’s spade lay buried up to its throat. The river had been playing at graveyard.

“We’ll do it at tide of people,” Mhairi said, which was her way of saying not at dawn—his bad hour—and not at noon when everything’s loud. The traffic had not started properly yet. The dog-walkers were about, and their companions went stiff-leggedly through life as if braced for a joke. Across on the Ury a heron took itself like a thought into the air and stood there because it had been doing it longer than he had been breathing.

“How?” Ewan asked, hating the plea shape in his mouth and being grateful for it at the same time.

“Ye ken how,” she said. “Ye just dinna prefer it. Ye ask. Ye promise. Ye decide. Ye dinna wait for the world to tell ye what ye are. Ye’ve three breaths. If ye use more, the world tells ye its version. If ye use less, ye tell the world what it wants and not what it needs. I’ll keep count. I’ll keep ye in the river’s manners. The thorn is for pricking pride. The red is for remembering blood that’s not yours to spill. Ye’ll open and close. We’ll throw nothing in. We’ll leave nowt but air behind.”

He took the jar. It was heavier here, or his arm was weaker; you can never tell and it doesn’t matter. The lid under his fingers had the memory of a machine. He thought of Blaise’s careful twist, the love he had for lids giving up, and he refused to be gentle in that way. He put the thorn to the lid’s lip and breathed out on it as on a spoon to cool porridge. He said, because it had worked once and because if a word has worked once you owe it that you try it again, “Please.”

The lid did its small ring and release. At the same instant Mhairi’s hand came down on his wrist not to stop him but to tell him he was not alone. “One,” she said, voice as calm as a religious potato. “Two. Three.”

The sound came out like a hand out of a stack of hay. It had bits of straw in it. It had the bulk weight of something you expect to be thin and find is not. It was a rooster, yes, the old shape of morning, the edge of a knife tied in a knot and set on a barrel. But in it, braided in the crow without mercy, were things he had never allowed himself to notice: the small before-sound of the throat, the spring in the chest, the ridiculousness. It was a boy pretending to be a king and knowing his friends were trying not to laugh; it was a door hinge doing its work bravely in a damp shed; it was the sound of a neighbour’s alarm clock through a wall who every morning at six-something cursed but got up anyway to go lay stones or take blood or draw lines straight as a creed. It was ugly and it was wonderful and it did not ask his permission to be both. It went through him and the hinge in him opened and a cool wind came and went and did not do any harm. He had time to think, This is almost holy in its refusal to be what I require, and then he shut the lid not in panic but in obedience to the rule he had agreed in his bones before he came down here.

He stood with the jar in his hands and Mhairi with her hand on his arm, and he was shaking the way you shake when you have been standing too long and your blood remembers to move. He waited for the thinness afterwards and the horrid return of the bowl—the plummet, the falling. It did not come. It stood back from him like a dog told to go to its bed. He opened his mouth and discovered he could breathe without climbing over anything. He made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been an old cough leaving.

“Again?” Mhairi asked after a while, so very kind that he nearly told her he loved her. She pinched his forearm. “Nay yet, laddie. Ye dinna bring an ocean into a tea cup twice in one morning. We’ll set it away.” She took the red off the thorn and put the thorn back into the hawthorn as if you could return its memory to it. “That’s its work. Ye’ve yours.”

He put the jar in his coat again. It felt less like a threat now and more like a spool of thin wire, dangerous if silly, useful if you knew where your fingers were. They stood a while and watched the water practice being itself. A man came down with a spaniel who regarded them as if they were horticulturalists interfering with the dog’s rights. The man nodded in that north way that doesn’t demand fairness or answer. Across the whisper of the willow leaves he could hear, faint, boys at the skate park practicing falling without breaking when they could help it.

“You’ll tell Archie ye’ve it,” Mhairi said, practical sliding back into her like a drawer. “He’ll scold. He’ll say words that sound like forms. There’ll be a word like evidence in there, and he is not wrong. Ye’ll say ye had ta make it safe, ye have not yet thrown it in the river like a numpty, ye’ll bring it to Lyle in a bag that does not have any devils in it.”

“I’ll tell him,” Ewan said, and lifted his face to the line of the hill. Bennachie had put a shoulder out of the cloud and was showing off its good bone. “It was… not as I thought.”

“It never is,” she said. “That’s the sorrow and the saving both.”

News travels in this town like water finds the low places—by inevitability and by teasing. By midday three separate people had come into the library with borrowed forms of the same story. In one, the bagman had died in a fight and risen from it like a zombie wearing a co-op uniform. In another, the police had discovered that he was a genius and given him a job at the recycling centre and a badge you could respect from a distance. Mr. Graham confided behind a large volume of forestry statistics that the lad taken out had been his own grandson, which was demonstrably false as Mr. Graham did not have children and also the boy in question had hair. The old woman by the window did not speak at all, which meant she knew exactly what had happened and had decided the town would choke on its own talk and then feel better.

Archie called at three with a voice that had been practising patience and now could nearly wear it. “Where are ye?”

“In the stacks.”

“Come out of the stacks and into the car park. I’m outside. Your face in my window in three minutes, Calder.”

He went. Archie sat with his arm out the van window as if it were July, which it was not, and wore his hi-vis with the look of a man who would have preferred armour if funding had allowed. PC Lyle was in the passenger seat with a file the thickness of a cheap jumper and the expression of a woman who has had to note down more adjectives than a person should. There was a smell of crisps because authority likes salt.

“Right,” Archie said when Ewan stood at his window. “Do ye have anything that belongs to the investigation and does not belong on your kitchen table?”

“Yes,” Ewan said because there was no point climbing into a lie that would only gouge him. “He left me a jar. I opened it. Controlled circumstances. Not at dawn.”

Archie closed his eyes briefly as if he had been a teacher too long and a child had told him they had done an experiment with the bunsen turned to Satan. PC Lyle turned a page and did not smirk, which counted as a compliment from the law. “What label,” she asked, pen ready.

“Cockspur,” he said, and had the odd sensation of giving away a truth that was not his and not the jar’s, but the town’s. “It holds… what it says. I opened it three seconds. With witness. It did no harm. It will do harm if kept badly. I was keeping it well.” He didn’t know why he needed to say the last, but his grandmother had always insisted that promises you make to yourself need to be aired where other ears can pin them to you later.

“How did it come to be on your premises?” Lyle asked, steady, a person who had never been to his kitchen but understood kitchens in general, which was nearly as good.

“He put it in my hedge.” He described the letter without saying what it had done to his hand to see Kindly, B. in that tidy ink. “I have it. I can bring it to you at the station at six. It will be sealed. It is a hazard if used as a weapon. It is less a hazard if you treat it as… as a live wire.”

Archie grunted. His eyes had the tired you get from taking in too much civic indignation at once. “Jesus wept at the paperwork,” he said, which was not his usual religious way. “Fine. Six. Don’t put it anywhere warm. Don’t put it anywhere very cold. Don’t put it in a bag.”

“I won’t,” Ewan said, and they looked at each other and had the experience of two men of different worlds finding themselves for a second in a plague year on the same bench. Archie nodded. “Ye did good,” he said, and then, as always, “Once.” He drove off with Lyle making notes at his left, and the van’s brake light blinked in the way of someone closing a parenthesis.

At four the schoolboys came and swore at triangles with a restored verve. They had heard, of course. Their hearing had improved miraculously in one day. “Mist’r Calder,” one said, the one with the soft half-moustache that looked as if it had been spilled by a careless god. “Is it true the bagman had birds that he’d trained to steal chips off folk for him?”

“I’m sure he had hopes,” Ewan said. “Birds have their own opinions.”

“Aye,” the boy said, with all a teenager’s contempt for any citizen not himself, “birds are away with it. I seen a gull swallow a bairn’s hat. Like. Whole. My maw says we should just poison them. I say that’s murder. But funny.”

“Your maw is wrong on method and you are wrong on texture,” Ewan said. “Gulls deserve respect for their honesty. They will steal off you to your face. Some folk make that into a career.” He looked at them properly. “Were ye at the garden centre?”

They did their teenage mouth shapes that are not speaking and not keeping silence. One shook his head with a seriousness that touched him. “Naw,” he said. “But Jay was. He said the man said if they tied stuff right they’d save wee birds. I dinna think he’s slept since last week. He smells like the swimming pool. He said he could hear the wind talk in the bags. That’s messed up, aye?”

“Very,” Ewan said. “Drink water instead of hearing wind if you have the choice. If Jay comes in, send him to Mrs. Latch at the allotments. She’ll tell him a story that doesn’t hurt afterwards.”

The boy’s face lit into mischief at the idea of sex in a shed because they are twelve even when they are seventeen, and then smoothed again as he saw that Ewan meant exactly what he said and not the joke the boy had thought would save them both from feeling anything. “Aye,” he said, and bent his head to the triangle that was older than him and his father and the arguments in their house.

At ten to six he signed out and put the CLOSED sign up and made sure the third light would not sulk, and then he took the jar back out of his pocket. He wrapped it in a tea towel that had a strawberry on one corner and a burn he did not admit to having made, and he put it in the old canvas bag from a book fair that had a print of a whale on it. He did not put that bag inside another bag. He walked to the police station by the path that passes the sly shop that sells things you didn’t know you needed tucked between the shoe repair and the accountants. Outside the station a hanging basket of petunias had refused to be cowed by the rest of the day and was being obscene in colour in the best way.

PC Lyle met him at the door and took him into a room that smelt like linoleum and anger soaked up. She took the jar with both hands and set it on a tray as if it were a cake a child had made and you could not risk letting pride vanish if the cake fell. “Thank you,” she said, rogue sincere in her face. “We don’t get this kind of assistance often.”

“It’s self-interest,” he said. “If that sound gets loose in the wrong place at the wrong time, someone with my shape of magic will go bottom-up. We are not thick on the ground, but we exist, and you’ll have paperwork you don’t have a template for.”

She met that with a look that said both, I have a template for most things and also I do not mind drawing a new one if it keeps the town from accusing me of being lax. “I’ll store it,” she said. “I’ll write in my file that it came to you and you secured it in company. That we did not lose anyone to stupidity this week. Archie will put his name under it because he loves forms the way other men love baths, for how they leave you clean.” She hesitated and then added, with the dryness of a person who does not like to learn but likes to have learned, “Is there anything else of his out there? Anything we should not put our hands in?”

“Yes,” he said, and thought of chalk and jars and the little nest of plastic under the table that had quieted at a please. “Corners. He liked corners. He liked the wind in a bottle and never asked it if it wanted to live there. Ask the boys. They’ll have the map whether he put it in their hands or in their feet. And there’s a rooster in town with a plastic tag on its leg. If you can track that, I’d be surprised. But men who like control like tags.”

She looked at him with the new penny eyes in which respect was a minting, not a gift. “I’ll put it in,” she said. “Even if the chief laughs. He owns chickens. He thinks that qualifies him for all knowledge.” She smiled then, a tiny thing that left the whole of her face unsullied. “You look better.”

“I heard one,” he said before he could choose not to. “It wasn’t a war this time.”

“No,” she said. “It’s a clock. We need them. Though I prefer a wristwatch.”

He went out into evening that was only pretending to be evening because summertime does that, shows you the day’s skull with skin still on. The wind had got bored of its new toy and gone somewhere else to find a crisp packet to flirt with. He walked past the co-op and the woman with the oranges waved her pound-bag at him as if she had read his earlier thoughts and wanted to show him how not to become a problem. Outside Moira’s bakery the crumb-streaked glass had been cleaned and the sign chalked: rowies two for wan today, because language refuses to behave for chalk too.

“Ye gave it up?” Moira called through the door as she was sweeping. “The Jar? Arch says we’re tae make sure folk are scared of jars for a week, which isna practical, but it’s him.”

“I gave it up to people who like lists,” he said. “That’s as practical as we’re going to get.”

She made her small wasp-frown. “Aye well. There’s a cockerel been seeing its-self in my window. My Morven’s away with it, barkin at her own reflection. If this is your doing, I’ll have ye bake on a Saturday.”

“If it starts writing me letters I’ll deal with it,” he said, and she laughed without meaning to, and it was a better charm than any he knew.

At home the cottage did that thing he had asked it to learn—met him at the door like a dog who has agreed to pretend it wasn’t anxiously waiting for your step. He put his palm flat to the wood and said nothing, and the door was good enough to accept that as language. He put the tea towel back on its hook. He put the whale bag away. He stood in the kitchen for a minute and heard, for the first time in a long time, only the house, only the settling. He went to the sink and put both hands under the cold again because he liked the way the pain told him his skin had borders. He took his hands out, shook them, and they were his.

Past midnight he went to the window and let the dark put its jaw on his shoulder. The lane was a strip of small agreements: do not slam doors, do not run cars, do not sing unless you have to. Somewhere a night train shouldered its way under the town like a memory of going elsewhere. He leaned his forehead against the glass that had seen war and ration and disco and men kissing women in corners their mothers would disapprove and men kissing the dark because the dark said nothing at all. He was glad in his quiet, which he had rarely allowed himself to be in case somebody accused him of not trying.

He woke with the light that comes too early to be polite and lay counting, as he did, the work in his chest. Three heartbeats. Five. A tenth of a river’s travel from one stone to the next. When the town’s rooster, not close, not his, did what roosters have always done in all the towns and pre-towns since chickens were dinosaurs and saw morning with their whole ridiculous faces, he lay and he did not turn into glass. He felt the hinge and allowed it and it did not turn him; he just opened and closed and opened again like he had promised himself he would do at the river. He lay and smiled once into the dark, a brief thing, and it didn’t crack.

There were new things to do. Archie sent a man round with a list like a scavenger hunt: small plastic constructions found in hedges by Danestone, a wreath of handles wrapped around the foot of the statue in the square, a child brought in a chain of bread bags like a rosary and said he had been told to carry it for luck. PC Lyle asked if he would come to a school assembly and say in that voice he had that turned tin into rope that it was fine to pick up litter but not to make art with it and certainly not to carry handles wrapped around your wrist because your blood is yours to keep. He said he would, and then looked at the calendar and remembered he had, in fact, two days a week a job that paid and included the care of the third light and a woman who needed not-reading by a window. He went to the headmistress and arranged that this was all the town’s work and he could be borrowed and returned like a careful book.

Jay came in to the library two days after the jar and sat himself in a corner and did not speak, and Ewan fetched him a glass of water without saying that water is not a magic but behaves like one when you have given your body over to the idea that you can hear plastics whisper. The boy drank. He put the glass on the table like he didn’t trust tables. He said, miserable and polite and still full of hope because fourteen is impossible, “He said we were menders.” He looked at his own hands as if they were stitched on and might pop. “I liked that. We were a team. Folk said we were daft. That was good. I liked being daft in a good way, if ye ken me.”

“I ken ye,” Ewan said. He sat and made sure his chair was set at a notation that meant, I can get up if you need me to and I can stay if you need me to. “There are mends that tie a thing back to itself and mends that tie it to the wrong house. Ye can always tell by whether something that lived can move after. If it cannae, you’ve made a cage and called it a fix.”

The boy stared at him with a hunger that made him so dear that Ewan nearly swore. “I keened the wind,” Jay whispered. “I heard it in the plastic. It liked it. It said it liked the new noise it made. That’s… bad, aye?”

“It’s new,” Ewan said. He thought of the jar and the silly glory of the crow and how it had refused to turn itself into a spear. “New things call themselves good to get invited in. Some are. Some are like a neighbour who borrows salt and then your car. Ye dinna need that neighbour in your kitchen. Ye can still nod to him in the street. The wind will manage. It does not need you to make it a song it did not ask for. It will be your friend if you do not talk too much.”

Jay nodded hard enough to wobble his hair. He was, just then, terribly pure. It made Ewan want to take a knife to the world for him and cut it into pieces that would not cut back. He said instead, because the old women had always told him that a boy learns truth better if it comes in a line he can walk, “Ye’ll paint the park fence with Archie on Saturday. In your old coat. Ye’ll swear at your mates for not holding the tin right. Ye’ll go home and eat bread with jam and you’ll think you have saved nothing at all. That will be the most mending done in this town that day, and the wind will gossip about ye to the trees and they’ll clap in their slow way.”

Jay grinned, at last. “Aye,” he said. “I can do that. I can swear. I’m good at swearing.”

“I am aware,” Ewan said modestly, and the boy’s laugh went under the desk where laughter keeps its spare skins.

There were cockerels now and then. Not many; not the plague his bones had told him to fear. He saw one at the lane again, not the same bird and yet all birds contain one another. This one had duller colours and a smarter eye. It stood on the gatepost as if the post were a pulpit, and when it crowed he stood and let it pass. It did not undo him. It simply told the day what time it was, and the day nodded because the day is polite.

He went up Bennachie on a Sunday because he always said he would and often did not, and he stood at the top with the not-many other people and looked out at the way the town petri-dished itself. He thought of the felt-tip drawing with COCKPIT written wrong-headed on it and wanted to take a very schoolroom eraser to the whole idea. There up in the wind, which had a true grin in it, he took the jar from his pocket and turned it in his hands. He did not open it. He did not need to. He let the wind read the label and have its say, which it did, blowing through his coat and catching at his hair as if he were a cousin.

On the way down he met PC Lyle with her ponytail fathered by economy and a small boy on a lead of twine—a relation, by the careful pride. She raised a hand in the way of professionals off duty agreeing they are still made of the same atoms when not paid to be. “How’s your jar?” she asked because she was the sort to make any subject comfortable.

“In custody,” he said.

“Good,” she said. “I’ve one for you.” She handed him a photograph, a printout off a printer that had been trying to die since 2009 but refused because there were agendas to be printed. The picture showed a rooster near a skip, its foot held up as if wincing. Around the raised leg was something like a ring. “Tag,” she said. “We can’t get close. Archie says it’ll dine on our fingers. You’ll tell me if you see it. There’s a number on the ring. Looks like someone’s experiment. I don’t like experiments unless I’m told about them first.”

“I’ll tell you,” he said. He looked at the numbers, which had the indifference of all numbers to what they have been forced to measure. He looked at the eye, which did not know of numbers. He thought of Blaise’s little handheld crow, the parody of a morning, and his stomach made a private agreement with gravity that it would not be going up the hill again today.

Mhairi had him in her kitchen that week, which was mostly a room with a table and a wall, and on the wall hung not photographs but lists of things to pull and things to plant and underlined words like nettles, which are friends if you know them. She cut him a slice of something that was either cake or a moral in disguise and told him, “There’s a place round by Kemnay where the bags are getting in frames. They’re braided now and they’ll want ta be curtains next. Ye ken how a house looks from the road if it’s got curtains where there ought nae be? Like a lie. We’ll go and take them down.” She poured tea in two chipped mugs that had seen fingers from three decades of hands. “We’ll tell the wind back to be wind. It’ll sulk. Then it’ll forget us and go to Orkney. That’s its right.”

He went with her and they found the curtains as she’d promised—old bags in new weaving, clever enough that you wanted to applaud and then stopped yourself because applause cements bad ideas into foundations. They cut them free with kitchen scissors and words and did not call it an exorcism. They left them in a pile on the roadside where a lorry would have to slow to avoid them, and Archie sent a van that was good at avoiding meant objects. The man driving it waved at them as if he had known them since birth, which in this town counted as probable.

He slept better even on the nights the wind tried his window. He woke less often certain he had drowned in a bowl. When he dreamed, sometimes he dreamed of his grandmother swatting him with a dishcloth and then kissing his hand as if the dishcloth were a formality she could live without.

It might have been three weeks after the jar that he stood in his lane at twilight closing the gate with its tired latch and he heard a little sound to his left. He turned and there, not four feet from him, near the hedge, the rooster from the picture had his head down and his foot stuck cocked as if it had sat too long with his weight on it. On the leg, above the spur, the ring. The bird saw him and made the throat-noise that is not warning and not welcome, the something in between that is what living is when you’re not telling anyone. He held very still. He put his hand out as if to whatever god is in charge of birds and said, quiet, “Please.”

The bird lifted its foot, put it down, lifted it again. He stepped closer in stages as if dancing. He could see the numbers now. The ring was not only plastic; it was plastic threaded with wire, a cheap trick from a dear mind. The wire had a tag. There were letters on the tag that made his stomach scald—BC—because of course a man like Blaise would not be content with the world knowing; he would need everything to know.

He did not grab. He did not pounce. He did the thing his grandmother had once taught him when catching an old hen in a coop: he made himself boring as winter. He let the bird consider him and come to the conclusion that he would, perhaps, in this one moment, allow interference. He put his hand on the leg in one swift soft press and felt the scaly heat of it and the terrible smallness. He took his penknife and slid it under the wire and snicked. The rooster made a sound like a swear from an old language and did not strike him because sometimes mercy makes even a stupid creature feel clever. The ring fell. He held it up between finger and thumb and the numbers showed their ugly teeth. He put it in his pocket without looking and stepped back at once so the bird did not have to be grateful, which would have insulted them both. It lifted, not very graceful, and dropped over the hedge into someone’s garden, which was a fate he would not wish on roses but could not prevent.

He took the ring out in his kitchen under the light that never sulked because he had taught it good behaviour through shame and bribery. The tag had the BC. Under that, a number that was not a number but a date, and under that, very tiny, a line that read: COCKSPUR. He made himself laugh because the alternatives would have taken the night and wrung the sweetness from it. He put the ring in a jam jar like a trophy you hope no one will admire. In the morning he took it to Lyle and she put it in a bag that, for once, he did not mind, and she did her paperwork like a woman writing a poem about drains.

“What next?” Archie asked him once on the street, which was his way of letting him know the town had stopped being amused and started being concerned. “He’s in remand. He reads. Which I think should be illegal in certain cases, but I’m told by my better angels that it is not. He’ll be out before trial if the sheriff likes his pen. Ye ken how men with tidy hair make everything look as if it’s not sticky. We’ll have letters to the editor. We’ll have his friends, the quiet ones, saying we’re hard on innovation. We’ll have boys who liked the way their hands felt doing a thing neat saying we stole their Saturday.”

“What’s next,” Ewan said, “is we make next. We go on doing the ordinary that nothing knows how to fight. We say please. We say enough. We say, will ye hold this end while I tie here. We sweep. We cut. We refuse to be impressed. We keep for ourselves the right to be astonished and not give it to any man who brings a label and a pen.”

Archie looked more tired and kinder than the first day Ewan had met him on a playground with a ball and the new sharp knowledge that other boys pick up and smash what scares them. “Aye,” he said. “That’s the kind of sermon I can sit through. By the way, the third light’s been behaving. Tell it I said thanks.”

“I will,” Ewan said, and went and told it, because compliments are a type of oil.

That evening he walked by the river and the bags were fewer in the hawthorn because people had got embarrassed, and embarrassment is a decent working tool if you use it to keep your hands out of what ought not be touched. The willow had shed a handful of yellow leaves that had the nerve to fall early as if to remind them all that nothing is theirs to schedule. A woman he did not know was teaching a child to skip stones with the moral seriousness such acts deserve. The stones mostly plopped. The woman did not say a swear word even once. He wanted to give her a medal.

He stood with his back against the fence and closed his eyes, and he could hear, with the jar not in his pocket and the river doing its manners and the wind out of a bottle and back where it was meant, the town’s old noises: a gull practising contempt; a door gently refusing and then accepting; far off the football pitch sucking boys into the enormous machine that turns bodies into running and then back into chatter. He thought of the rooster. He thought of the jar on a shelf in a station that smelt of floor cleaner and cigarettes that men lied about. He thought of Blaise sitting in a room with a man making notes and deciding whether to be charming, whether to be sorry, whether to insist that the word he had been looking for all his life had been tidy. He thought of himself at ten falling into a bowl and coming up years later with river in his ears and swearing he would not listen. He thought of Mhairi’s thorn, red-wound and then returned to the bush like a mistake he had been allowed to keep, and he let the day take him in where a house takes a draught—a small gap under the door, purposive, useful, not to be mocked.

He went home. He went to bed. He woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still. Out in the birches there was the breath the old cottage knew. Somewhere toward the Don a fox made its old sewing-machine noise. The air at his throat was good enough to drink. Far off, not near, not unkind, a rooster told the day to have some courage, and Ewan’s magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, stretched like a cat and made itself large without making a show of it. He smiled once, a small thing, and the dark smiled back in its blank way. He said the three names and the folded line of the Don’s course, and he slept two hours more because morning had asked; he had not told it what to be.Chapter 7

The letter came in rain, which made of its tidy ink a private weather. Ewan found it halfway under the mat as if it had tried to come in of its own accord and then thought better of it. He lifted it between two fingers so as not to give it more of his hands than courtesy required and took it to the table where all things that wanted judging sat to learn their place. The writing was that same narrow neatness, a schoolroom’s pride that thought itself a virtue, and the words arranged themselves as if queuing at a bus stop: Ewan Calder, curator of quiet—because I am not a barbarian, I will not force conversation upon you in person. I am, by the council’s grace, detained. I am, by my own lights, working. The river dreams me. The wind remembers me. The town is a machine that will accept the proper fuel if you prime it. You primed it the other way. How clever. I grudgingly admire. There is in the world a principle that hates slackness, that wishes things to be taut and make music. We are both servants of it. I send you, not a jar, but a game. Fold any three bags into a plait. Tie them so that a child could not pull them apart. Then think of a bird and say its name backwards and blow. If you are honest, it will hum. I require nothing from you. I only wish to register that tidy is a love the law does not understand. B.

He put the letter face down. He drank his tea. He turned it over again and read the words a second time because men are not better than cats; they go back to the door to see if it holds. He felt in the room a small bristle as if the cottage had decided it disliked being called a machine, and he soothed it with the flat of his palm on the table, palms making friends with wood as they are trained to do in decent houses. He took the letter to the stove and held it low, not to burn it yet—he did not want Blaise’s tidy smoke under his beams—but to let it meet heat and consider whether it truly wished to be in his keeping.

Mhairi came round within the hour because rain has a way of telling her where to go, and because the town’s Rota of Worry always had his name pencilled in. He set the letter for her on the table and she read, moving her lips a little as some old hands do because words sometimes need help getting out of their beds. “He’s making spells that wear gloves,” she said, sour as rowan. “Letters are spells ye have to hold in your very eyes, which is worse than a jar because ye cannae put a lid back on words once they’ve touched the bit in ye that thinks with pictures. We’ll no keep it. We’ll cut it up. We’ll ask the rain to take the vowels.”

She was as good as her instructions. She took her kitchen scissors out of her bag as if she’d been buying onions and trimmed the letter into strips, then into small beige snow which she tipped into the saucepan she’d brought without explanation. The water there smelled faintly of metal and leaves. She stirred with a spoon that had seen army soup and christening broth and mourners’ tea. “If ye read a spell twice, ye’ve let it have a chair at your table,” she said, not looking up. “Ye read it once for warning. Ye read it a second time for pride. Ye dinna read it a third unless ye like company ye canna evict.” She tipped the wet paper into her hand and squeezed it. The strips shivered and then softened and fell through her fingers back into the pot. “We’ll have the rain keep the shape o the words and let the meaning go with the steam.”

Outside, the rain that had arrived with the letter did its ordinary work of making mistakes look pretty. On the path the hedgerow let a bag lift and put itself down again, dissuaded, perhaps, because the air smelled of vinegar and old iron and nobody likes to rust unnecessarily. Ewan felt gratitude to the day simply because it had decided not to be dramatic. He got his coat and walked Mhairi back toward the allotments, the two of them bent slightly into the weather like pen strokes with character.

At the gate the saucepan went to a hook where odd things hang in this town so they can be seen enough to be thought about and not so much that folk begin to ask if they can borrow them. Mhairi shook her hands dry and squinted at the sky in the way of a woman who has argued with it into her seventies and knows its tricks. “Ye’ll have folk come in with jars of their own now,” she said, not unpleased. “Any numpty with a label thinks himself a scientist. We’ll be polite and we’ll throw their wee storms back into their big ones and tell wind to go do its rightful job, which is ta move but not tell folk what they are.”

It was not a jar that came first. It was a mist like a clothesline. In July the haar is a visitor from sea with manners, usually; it arrives late, leaves early, and keeps its wet hands to itself. This came up the valley wrong-footed and went down into the shopping precinct as if it had lost an earring and would not leave till it found it. Moira’s window went soft, and in that soft he saw for an instant that this fog wanted to hold sound the way a jar does, keep it in to admire later. The co-op door hissed its usual hiss at opening and the sound sat in the mist, heavy as soaked wool. Out on the pavement, a boy’s laugh stayed near his mouth, swelled, and then sank like the heavy end of a seesaw. Ewan did the silly thing and put his hand out into the white as if feeling for a wall; the air pressed back slightly, as if it had learned recently that it could.

He threw his sense sideways and found the police station by the feeling of forms piled up in a small space. Inside PC Lyle’s tidy had gone a little mad—papers out, hairline a touch sweaty, a fan on a windowsill trying to make its own weather and failing. She looked up as he came in and did not say the apology some people think they owe if they are not under control. “We’ve a breach,” she said. “Haar, the labelled kind. The jar I took off him—the one says BOUGHT AND PAID—wasn’t properly sealed. I had it in a box in a box in a room with an attitude, and even so it decided it’d like to see your town. The station stinks like old dishcloth. Archie’s using the word seep like it owes him a drink.”

“Where is it?” he asked, and she pointed with her pen because pens also get to be brave. In the evidence cabinet, behind shaming glass, sat Blaise’s neat cylinder with its churchgoing lid. A wetness filmed the inside like breath on a mirror. Next to it, absurd as a farm at a tea party, was the rooster machine, tagged and bagged, which had come in with the rest of the objects from the garden centre. It was off. It looked sulky about that, which was nonsense for a thing with two batteries and a speaker that would not pass muster on a cheap toy.

The mist outside pressed its face to the window as if to see how the police file their air. Ewan rests his hands on the counter and felt the grit left by nights where angry men had banged their knuckles into it and said they weren’t angry. He had three breaths. He knew it. He looked at the jar and imagined he could see a tide behind it. “No dawn,” he said, because it mattered to tell the day what it wasn’t. “No barrels. No hedges. Just a room that insists upon itself.” He nodded at Lyle. “Open the cabinet. I’ll open the jar. You count. Then I’ll close it and you tape it like a library book someone’s loved too hard.”

“Yes,” she said, brisk, because she was the kind of person who will count three seconds for a man and not make a fuss after. She keyed the cabinet, and the door opened with that polite kui-chink that had been designed to make burglars feel bad. The fog at the window took interest, as if sound had been looking back at it from inside and it wasn’t used to that rudeness. Mhairi was not here; he had to be his own thorn and thread.

He lifted the jar, feeling the re-used throb of it, and he made his breath into a shelf on which to put what came. The lid gave like something that had wanted to get through a little door too much and had bruised itself. Lyle said, even, “One. Two. Three,” and he turned the lid at the same time as she said the last, because sometimes shutting a thing is not the opposite of opening it but part of the same act. The haar shouldered out and went for the corners like a cat in a new house; it smelt of coins and laundry and old apology. It pretended to want to stay as fog, but the room with its lists and clipped-on instructions and coffee in a council mug refused to be a harbour. Lyle put tape on the jar, round and round, a ridiculous secular exorcism, and the fog sighed and decided to look out the window instead, and then decided to be weather where it belonged.

They put the jar back like a child put back into their bed and Lyle leaned on her hands and said nothing about the hollow that had appeared under her cheekbones. “Archie,” she said then, and that one word meant a thousand lectures, two reports and a biscuit in a wrapper half-opened and put aside. “I’ll write that we did what we did twice as quick as the time will say we took.”

“Good,” Ewan said, and looked at the rooster machine as if it were a bomb. “And don’t let anyone give that to a charity shop. That’s a curse-box. The first bairn who presses that as a joke will own mornings for a week and not like the rent.”

After the fog the town behaved itself with the rectangular cheeriness of bunting, and then it didn’t. Moira’s Morven got herself into a snare in the park that wasn’t a snare, not quite; it was a dress of bread bags braided with tinsel beads to make a net that shone like a lie. The little dog, who had the temperament of a broken smoke alarm and the legs of a disgraced cutlery drawer, went in and could not find the way out because the shine confused her. Ewan was there because he goes where he sees corners that think too much of themselves, and this was a corner of air that had opinions. He picked up the net as if it had asked him to carry it over a puddle. It caught at his fingers in that small-nailed sucking way plastic learns when it has been praised beyond its character. He could not do the sugar trick here. The tinsel had made the whole into something like language—a false one, the kind hyenas speak when they want to look like they’re laughing.

He set his teeth in his mouth the way you do when you know someone will ask you to be more careful than your nature leans to. He looked for the motive in the motion. He found it where the two silver loops had been tied through a handle—so neat, so prissy, a tie done by someone who has never taken a woven bag to the market in rain. He cut there, with a word sharp and very small, and the net lost its sentence and fell back into a basket of things it had been before. Morven squalled and leaped into Moira’s arms, and Moira, who swore at bakers and angels alike when they deserved it, said a thank you that made the day clear its throat.

“Some bugger’s trying to make Christmas with rubbish,” she said, wiping her eyes like a woman who does not have tear ducts to spare. “I’ll set a trap o my own. A tray of sausage rolls with curses on them. See who falls.” She glared at the net, now stupid on the grass. “I ken a braid of good hair when I see one, and that’s no it.”

That night Ewan went to Bennachie again because it had not asked him and therefore he could bear it. He did not go to the top; he went to the shoulder where the wind stops telling you its important thoughts and remembers how to joke. He stood with his face ruft and counted. A crow from a distant yard; another, closer by the smallholding; a third, laughably muffled as if someone had stuffed a sleeve into a pipe. He let each into his chest and let each out. The hinge he had made of himself felt oiled and not at all like something that could trap fingers. He smiled, and on the path down he met a man with a child in a carrier who gave him the nod of a person who has forgotten that the day once came in without his permission.

The library made him a committee. He did not intend it so, but he pinned a note on the corkboard that morning—Hinge Walk, Friday evening, meet at the sign, bring a bag only if you promise to take it home again—and half the town came with their courtesy and their reluctance bundled together. Mrs. Bruce came with her hands like paper and a scarf that had musicians on it whose horns would have made Blaise fidget. Archie came because he hated anything that sounded like a movement and liked anything that looked like a route. PC Lyle came without her radio, which made her look naked and amused her that this was so. Jay came because being in a group where no one shouted and something got done had the new shine of a hobby he might keep. Mhairi came without explanation, with a stick tied with ribbon, and nobody asked in case saying would jinx it.

They walked the town’s joints, the places where it leaned. The bridge where the river thinks about getting married to the other river and decides to remain itself; the underpass where teenagers perform the rite of complaining correctly about school; the corner by the co-op where wind likes to try on masks. At each they put their hands to stone or to metal or to the air itself and said small things that meant, You and me, we’ve a deal. They took the bags they found and turned some to sugar and some to bowls around stones where the water immediately did a better job of deciding where it wanted to go. They wrote please on cards and left them in silly places like the crook of a drainpipe and the lip of a fence, and the cards were gone by morning because please is keen to be useful.

“You’ve made them all druids,” Archie muttered, not displeased, dragging a tangle of white out of a privet hedge with the same precision he used to pin a barrier across the road where cows had got out. “I’ll get grief for this if someone breaks a wrist saying gentle to a bollard.”

“Let them,” Mhairi said, tying her ribbon’s end back on itself to make a thought. “The town’s full of noise that thinks itself words. We’re putting the words back under the noise where they belong.”

Blaise wrote again from wherever men who are not sure if they are the villain or the hero recline to build their next paragraph. This one came through the post proper, stamped with a belief in institutions. Ewan put it on the shelf for three days and when he opened it, it tried to cling to his fingers for gratitude. It boasted that a councillor had come to see him and said interesting; it boasted that a newspaper had called him an artist because the photographs of his chalk circles printed well. It boasted that he had followers in a larger town where the river did not mind being told what it was because people there kept putting lamps into it in remembrance and expected it to accept. It asked after Ewan’s quiet and whether he had learned that asking the morning to call you by your own name is the only way to stop being battered by it. Ewan read it once and then folded it and put it not under the pan but under a book about washing greens and letting them sit, because it deserved that kind of boredom.

The station called him to look at a spill. It was not of oil. It was tea, and the way of it was melancholy. The receptionist, who had lately had her hair done and would have liked someone to say so without making a fuss of it, had knocked a mug over in the evidence room. The tea had run to the boxes and the boxes, being men’s, had not been sealed as one always promises to seal. The tea had found a crack in the lid marked TILL SLEEZE and had taken in what was offered, as tea will. Now the dark on the lino had the unarguable lustre of an eye. Everyone was embarrassed. Lyle stood with her arms folded and looked as if she would like two more arms and a minute away with a packet of crisps and nobody asking.

“Don’t go in with bare feet,” Ewan said, because sometimes the obvious is a spell. “You’ll come out hating your own toes.” He crouched and set his fingers to the floor near but not in the tea and breathed on it as if cold. He remembered the bowl not as drowning but as a teaching, and he let his breath be three countable things. The tea looked back as if to accuse him of pretending it had never been necessary. He said, because you sometimes have to be stupidly plain to win certain arguments, “Enough,” and the men in the hall who liked to shout gave up one of the words they had learned from him without admitting it and let it go. The sheen dulled. The stain remained. He made himself smile because he had learned it soothed those who can’t bear a mess they forgot to prevent. “You’ll always have a mark there,” he said to Lyle, gentle. “You might as well make friends with it.”

Her mouth did that thing it did when she was persuaded to be human when she would have preferred to be a desk. “We’ll put a mat over it,” she said. “Nobody will admit why.”

Mornings grew their legs as the summer took to telling people it was busy elsewhere, and Ewan found himself waking earlier and not hating it by law. He had the jar in his keeping no more, which pleased him, and he had a small box of cardboard circles he cut out of cereal boxes on evenings when he needed the comfort of a small sharp thing, and on each he wrote words he did not justify: please, enough, later, now, hush. He gave them away to people who looked as if their own words had packed a bag and left. He tucked some under lampposts from which men liked to hang opinions. He slid one under the foot of the third light because it had begun to mind its manners without needing to be told and it deserved a tip.

On a Wednesday the sky turned the yellow you get when weather has been told by an office to be careful and has decided to obey by being noisy. Archie called it with relish a warning, which gave him leave to be everywhere and be helpful without being told no. “It’s in off Peterhead,” he said, which meant nothing and everything. “Loose rubbish will go flying. I’ll have men out with lorries. I’ll have bairns told not to kite anything that looks like it’s got a plug. Ye’ll be using your mouth at people no doubt.” He sounded tired and pleased because there are days when his work looks like exactly the thing someone made him for.

The wind came with that mean humour it sometimes gets near harvest. It wanted to remind everyone who is in charge of roofs. The hedges that have survived a dozen winters and two bad summers bent their backs. The bag nests in the places they had not yet found spoke up in a chorus and then were torn out of their cleverness and dragged across verges and into ditches. Up by the bypass, a thing like a kite got loose from the old garden centre roof—the place sealed now and taped and labeled but still with corners—and made for the carriageway like a saint for its martyrdom. It was a sail of proper bags stitched at their handles and turned into a letter that the town would have to read if it landed where men drive fast. Jay saw it because boys’ eyes are better when there is trouble they can be useful with, and he did the thing even good boys rarely do without flinching; he ran to find an adult and brought that adult—Ewan—right to it.

They were a bad team and they were perfect. Jay held the sagging of the sail by one corner and swore under his breath like someone being careful of an old china teacup. Ewan went for the knot, always the knot, and found that the man who had tied this one did not love knots for themselves but for what they could make others do, and that is the sort easiest to unfasten if you insult it. He said nonsense to it. He said ugly. He said you are not a net, you are a group project that got out of hand. He said please, at the end, because he is himself, and the knot gave up in a sulk and the sail fell on them and then around them, and then the wind, liking a joke, lifted the vast plastic sheet like a theatre cloth and slapped it into the layby, where Archie’s van came as if conjured and put a wheel on the corner of it like a man pinning down a drunk.

On the other side of the dual carriageway, a crow-box crowed, ridiculously loud in its bravado, from someone’s porch—a copycat or a leftover, who knew—and Ewan felt the hinge in him look over, see nothing that required it, and go back to its breakfast. He pressed his hands to the plastic as if it were an overexcited child and told it in the tone he used for boys with triangles that the performance was over. Jay sat down hard in the wet verge and put his hand over his eyes and laughed. It sounded exactly like relief and nothing like triumph, which made Ewan want to bless him and instead made him say, “Rowie?”

Moira had rowies because anyone with sense stocks carbohydrates when the weather means to speak in capital letters. She handed them out at the corner where the walk cut short and the older men liked to stand to see what’s going. “We’ll call it a festival,” she said, covering the pot with a towel because towels are a kind of mercy. “Festival o Taking Things Down. The things’ll sulk. Then they’ll forget they ever got above their station.”

The wind unbuttoned the day and then thought better of it, seeing it had pulled enough. By evening the bins had bruises but the fences had not flown. Children went out to look at where things now sat that had no business sitting there and made of it a treasure hunt. Archie, whose heart preferred a neat grid, allowed it so long as nobody took the cones away from the places where men would be with trucks. PC Lyle walked with her hands in her jacket pockets and looked at everything as if she was collecting names for later. At the allotments, plants that needed staking got it, plants that would not benefit from useful help were left with the dignity of falling over on their own.

Ewan went home into a house that had remembered how to hold itself against a shout. He shut the door; the latch made its particular noise of I have your back. He put his hands under the cold as he had learned to do because pain, properly administered, can be a leash on lesser pain. He leaned his forehead against the window and watched the lane’s own little festivals—a bag doffing itself as if in apology, a milk carton wedged under a car tyre like a sulking child, the young ash on the verge dancing because it has to. He listened hard because habit is a kind of addiction, and he knew what the morning would bring; even after a storm, roosters tell the truth. He smiled, not showing his teeth, because tonight he did not need them.

Blaise wrote again, as men who fancy themselves protagonists will, but the letter came folded into itself in that way that suggests the hand that folded it had nothing else to do and wanted you to know it. He left it in the hedge. Ewan saw it because the hedge had an expression and he had learned to read shrubs. He took it and did not take it in the house. He put it under a stone where rain could get to it slowly and worms at their leisure. He did not read. He let himself wonder for a whole minute what in it was meant for him and not for the writer, and then the minute was over and he went and made tea and put three circles on the table in a row—please, enough, later—and the arrangement was so exactly what he felt he laughed aloud and the cottage took it with the grace of old timber.

The week came back to its ordinary singing. Babies were born and had their names put under G and K and W by someone with a pen and neat wishes. The old woman by the window came and not-read and, one day, reached and put the tip of one paper finger on the glass and tapped and said, with huge courtesy, “Thank ye,” which brought tears to his face because it meant nothing and everything. The boy Jay stood up under a triangle and announced that the shape had ceased to be rude to him, which is the kind of victory men will ruin if they name too loudly. Archie came to the library with a clipboard and had it taken out of his hand by the quiet and returned to him with a small bruise of reflection. PC Lyle sent him a photograph of the place on the floor with the stain and the mat over it and wrote under it, Mother says you never put a mat over a problem. I say, not if you forget it’s there.

Under that photograph he pinned, silently and without superstition, one of his circles. Hush, it said, and he did, because not talking is sometimes better than any cleverness he might wield. The rooster in the lane crowed at wrong times and right times, and the hinge did its patient work and did not require thanks. In the river, a bag from somebody’s big shop came under the bridge and aimed itself for the reed bed with an intelligence it did not own. He put his hand over the rail and shook his fingers once and it failed to climb into meaning, falling away into its smaller selves. The wind printed itself against the side of the house and read itself there like a child at a library board pointing with a fat finger at letters it knows and making them into a story, and he was content to correct nothing while the day tried.

In late afternoon one thunderhead rolled in with the petulance of a god who missed devotion and meant to make of the skylight a platform. The light in the library became a lake held in the ceiling. The third tube did not sulk; it held its nerve like a thoughtful witness. Mrs. Bruce did not budge from her chair. The lads came and asked if he had any book where the hero was not an idiot about girls, and he gave them two and a half and they said, concentrated, that would do. He filed a jar in his mind that he did not intend ever to make and labelled it UNDERSTANDING, FOR WHEN YOU CAN BE BOTHERED, and he laughed at himself because being a man in a town is like that; you are given labels and you invent the rest.

He went home with fresh things for supper and found at his gate, not on it, not theatrical for once, the rooster, which scratched the dirt with a nonsense innocence and did not look at him beyond the way animals look to see if you are about to be coarse. Its leg bore no ring. Its eyes had the worldly vulgarity of chickens and the good luck. He stood and counted his breath and then, because he could and not because he had to, he said aloud into a lane that made a habit of minding other folk’s business, “Good evening,” and the bird flicked a bit of grit at his boot and stalked off with no ceremony at all. It was exactly the correct courtesy.

After dark, he lay on his bed with the door open to the hall and the window cracked, letting the sound of what little rain there was sort itself. He said again the three names and the fold of the Don and the words were muscle rather than prayer. He slept and woke and slept, and in the thin hour when once you climbed out of bed to sit on the floor because your throat had been stolen by a bird and the world was too hinge and not enough door, he turned on his side and the night did not argue. Far off, a cockerel, not the lane one, not any particular one, did its opinion, and down in the centre of him something ordinary agreed without fanfare. He looked, just before going under again, at the little circles on the table that he had forgotten to put away and thought, without making a plan, that the next one would have to say sorry, and that he would learn where to place it.Chapter 9

The morning had ironed itself after the storm, crisp as a shirt your mother still insists on pressing when you come home. Roof slates lay where they always meant to, not on the pavement telling stories about gravity. In his kitchen, with the kettle finding its note, Ewan cut a circle from a cereal box and wrote sorry on it in his best small hand. It didn’t look much beside please and enough and later on the table—sorrier than the word suggested, in fact—but the cardboard took the ink without flinching. He set it aside as if it were the kind of bread you don’t slice till someone hungry sits down.

A thick envelope had come from the council stamped with a logo of a stylized tree that would never, in its life, put a root where it might meet a stone. Inside there were two requests that irritated each other like grains of sand under a lid. The first was sensible and had Lyle’s lean handwriting in the margins: would he attend a school assembly at the academy to talk about “citizenship around materials,” which was a way to say to lads, do not carry handles round your wrists as if you are apprentices to a saint. The second was printed and aspirational and had a councillor’s signature underneath and the politely deluded smell of a new initiative about it: an evening forum on “Tidy as Love,” a public discussion with “stakeholders” about what art is when it’s made from what people throw away. The name Blaise did not appear, which meant it had put on a jacket and gone by itself.

He put both letters under the magnet shaped like a carrot and watched them try to hold still. The cottage hummed faintly with disapproval of meetings, which it considered less honest than weather, and he patted its sill like a dog’s flank. The sorry circle looked at him with the simultaneous humility and pride of all apologies worth making. He pocketed it with a small braced breath and went out because the lane required him.

Moira hailed him from the bakery door, hair clamped under a scarf that had croissants where there ought to be flowers. “Hae ye seen the drains?” she called, as if drains were a show you could buy tickets to. “Down by the square. Nae running right. Archie’s away wi himself and no wrong. There’s… filters. That’s what the lads are calling em.” She made a face as if the word had got sugar in it and turned wrong.

He found Archie at the corner where the buses nose in and out and old men keep their weather inside their coats until somebody asks. The hi-vis vest made him look like a lighthouse someone had parked. He was on his knees with a gully lifter and a humourless patience, pulling up from the throat of the drain a handsome horror—three braided carriers made into a bandage and fitted with a frame that had been cut from a fruit crate and tied in, clever, with bits of free municipal string. “Jesus,” he said conversationally without looking up. “He’s invented a flood.”

The thing had a mind in the vulgar way of all objects to whom men attribute care. It clung, not with teeth, but with the logic of a person who has convinced himself he is helping and now will not stop. Jay stood a pace back with a litter picker and the earnestness of a volunteer who is determined to make good the phrase good intentions. PC Lyle had a map on a clipboard and a pen behind her ear and was making a list of grates that would argue.

Ewan crouched, breathing river and heat from the tarmac. The woven filters had the same problem as Blaise’s curtain had: they were trying to make themselves into something with a purpose nobler than their nature could hold. He slid his fingers under the band and felt where motive sat, which was in the knot that bound the pretty to the useful. “Shy bairns get nowt,” his grandmother’s voice said in his head, and he said, so small the drain could pretend he hadn’t spoken, “Please,” and then, because this was not only about asking nicely, “Enough.” He put the sorry circle against the metal of the grate, just under the lip where nobody would see unless they were in the habit of putting their names where they must be rubbed by other people’s steps. The net went slack in a way that was not defeat so much as a decision to be heavy. Archie, feeling it, swore with relief that would have made any communion wine curdle and got the thing out with a wet slide.

“Bairns’ll think this is good civic spirit,” he grumbled, not unkind. “Filtering.” He spat the word into the gutter as if it had a taste. “Then the sky’ll fall down and they’ll be first to kick the council for not having gills ready.” He thumped the grate back into place and nodded to Lyle. “We’ll do the one by the bank next,” he said, as if he had always known where every vulnerable mouth in the town lay.

A cockerel crowed then from a garden up the hill—real bird, not box, with the throatiness of a thing that doesn’t know it’s making music ancient and daft. Ewan felt the hinge open politely and close itself again without offence. He had a palm flat on cold metal, and cold metal was as good as any Psalm for a man who believed in the physics of decency. The morning did not turn to glass. It obliged, said its say, and was quiet again in exactly the way a good sentence is.

They worked along the street in a clumsy procession—two lads with barrows for whatever they pulled, two old men who had seen water in war and did not mask their advice, a girl of nine holding the roll of bin bags like a scepter because she had been allowed to be useful. Archie muttered filters, filters, as if he might summon by charm the places they were. Lyle put a tick where they'd been and a question mark where the map had never been trusted. Jay, careful, pressed his heel on the corner of a bag and shook his hand like a magician’s assistant when a tail refuses to come free. People stopped and watched and were not unkind about it; they do that here, admire quiet work with the sort of approval that is almost an apology for how rarely it gets done in front of them.

At the school the assembly had the smell of varnish and wet hair. The hall was the colour of sports and a little ennui, a reasonable size for hospitality and for heartbreak. Ewan stood at the front where a deeply optimistic mural had painted girls and boys passing a globe between them as if the earth were a ball that needed exercise. He held up a triangle he’d cut from card—just a triangle, three equal sides, the sort that has always insisted the world be precise—and he saw four hundred faces lean as if they wanted it to be a trick.

“Three breaths,” he said, and the teachers, to his satisfaction, obeyed more quickly than the students did. “Out loud if ye like. In your head if ye prefer. One, two, three.” The room acquitted itself of air like a choir told to begin again. “That’s the whole of it,” he said. “The clever word for it is hinge. It’s the bit in between. Magic likes the bit in between, but so do we, we just pretend we don’t. Anyone brings you a clever thing and says it will tidy the world and you don't need to think about it, you say, I’ll take three breaths and then I’ll act. It’s not heroic. It’ll make the right lads think you’re a wet blanket. Do it anyway.”

A boy at the back crowed then—because if you tell young males not to play with sound, you make it delicious—and for a moment the room trembled as if it intended to be an arena. Ewan put his hand up not to silence so much as to tip the room back into itself. “Aye,” he said, “bird says morning. We do not put it in a jar for later. We do not make dresses out of the mess and pass them round as if we’ve invented fashion. We get up. We go to school. We do our three breaths. We pick up what we dropped. We dinna make nets that catch what never hurt us.”

Jay stood to his feet without meaning to and in that motion there was the whole reason adults put on ties and ask boys to sit still. “He said we were menders,” he called, because there’s no point pretending a shared mistake isn’t excellent company. “He said the wind liked it.”

“And wind will always say it likes whatever it’s just been given,” Ewan said. “It’s greedy, wind. It’ll say it loves a new noise because new is tasty. That’s why you don’t take wind’s first opinion. You take your three breaths. You listen to your gran. You ask the river if it would like to swallow what you’ve braided for it.” There was a ripple of laughter for river as if he had made it a teacher on relief, and the relief was good. “If you see a bag that wants to be sugar,” he added, “shake your hand and call me. If you see a net where there was not a net, cut it. Care is a knot that makes someone free, not stuck.”

He pressed the triangle flat against his palm. The hall breathed because he had asked it to. He set down three cardboard circles on the piano as if he were laying out biscuits and the children leaned as they do when a trick is going to be given away and then turned into a better trick in their own pockets. “Please,” he said, tapping the first. “Enough.” He put his fingertip on the second. “And this one, you’ll hate it, you’ll think it’s soft, but it will save you when you have done harm because any human does, and it’ll save your pal when you mean to be good and you were not. Sorry. Not the cheap kind. The kind that says, I did it, I won’t do that one again, and I’ll fix what I can. That third word is a grown-up. Nobody wants to adopt it. But if you carry it, the world will lend you its arms when yours are tired.”

Afterwards, at the forum in the Town Hall with the stack of metal chairs and the carpet that remembered the feet of mayors, the councillor with hair that believed in combs did his best with tidy as love. He used graphs and pictures of bins smiling, and he did not say the word Blaise, which meant he said it more than he intended. In the row behind, two women who loved their gardens with violence nodded when he said community art, and the man from the paper sharpened his pencil with a knife whose blade had been polished on a lifetime of meetings. Lyle wore a dress under her jacket that looked like she had reluctantly bought it and then had grown fond of it because it did as asked. Archie, who had no intention of speaking, had been given a roving microphone and held it like a man who would rather hold a hammer and yet could not resist the weight of it.

Mhairi did not sit. She stood at the back with her basket and her scarf tied tight under her chin and looked, as always, like the warning at the end of a fairytale that the children only half hear because they’ve been sent to bed. The councillor opened the floor. A man with a voice like a clean desk said he had been to Glasgow and seen installations made from plastic bottles that made him feel uplifted, and a student with fringe and opinions said art should be allowed to be naughty if it taught, and then a woman Ewan did not know said her wee spaniel had come home with a necklace of rings and she had thought him cute until the vet told her the word embedded.

“Ye can make each other uncomfortable with your clever,” Mhairi said into the space between the microphone being offered and her disagreeing with its existence, and the words went to the far corners of the hall the way chickens do when a shadow passes. “But you dinna tell a river to agree with your art. Ye dinna tell wind what noise it makes. If ye tie a knot make sure whatever ye’ve tied can walk after it. If it cannae, cut it. Leave your tidy to your drawers and your mind, not to the throats o birds.”

A boy near the front pressed something in his hand out of mischief or loyalty, and the crow-box in his jacket pocket gave a cheap shout. The sound was thin, the way a brag dwindles when faced with someone’s grandmother. It raised the hair at the back of Ewan’s neck as old voices do. He set his shoulders to the hinge and let the cheap morning go through and out. There was a murmur in the room like the beginning of a hymn, and Mrs. Bruce, who had surprised everyone by being there, hummed Cwm Rhondda under her breath like a floorboard that knows its tune. The little device sulked as objects do when ignored properly.

The councillor made his resolution with treacle and care: that there should be evenings of untying for anyone who wanted to make their hands honest; that drains would be checked in the kind of rota that pleases a certain type of man so that the rest of us can forget what the word gully means; that young folk who liked the feel of weaving would be given bales of old rope and told the correct, ancient, useful knots to make, and someone, not Ewan, christened the project Hush Rope, which made the room pleased and awkward and willing. Lyle stood, mercifully brief, and said harm was harm even if you had a label, which is all the law can say when the town wants to be romantic. Archie said a word about responsibility that was less a word than a look. The student with the fringe waited afterwards to say that he had thrown his crow device in a bin, which was polite and not enough, and Mhairi, who had seen more bins than most, said, take the batteries out first, son, and the boy looked grateful for being given specifics.

He walked the long way home because after talking plain you should let your words lie down in the grass. He stopped at a gate he had not touched since the day of the Tupperware, and his hand did what it had wanted to do in the memory and hadn’t—rested there, flat, respectful as if on a forehead. The Knoxes were in the yard with their hands where all good hands are in the evening—on small wood and stubborn hinges. Mrs. Knox, headscarf in a print of strawberries that had usurped the season, waved. “We moved em last month,” she said, before he could say anything. “The birds. Ye dinna need to walk the long way now if it’s just that. It was nae bother.” She said it in the tone of a woman trying to make a kindness small enough that it can be received.

He stepped in with the gait of a man who has come to ask a thing he cannot ask without also admitting to the shape of his fear. The cockerel in the yard was a handsome idiot named Rab—Mrs. Knox told him with a pride she would have been ashamed to show about a son. Rab had a smutted comb and the look of a creature whose brain is busy as a pea rolling in a cup, which is to say busy enough. He strutted, as all roosters are condemned to do by something the priests probably named pride, and he did his morning even though it was evening because chickens do not own watches. The sound came out with the scaffolding showing and the ridiculous lilt and the old necessity, and Ewan stood about two yards from it and put his hand—just to say he was here—on the door of the coop. His hinge opened and closed. It did not try to take the whole day in. It was content with three breaths. It was, he realized with a jolt that left beauty behind like a found coin, not an enemy. It was a clock.

“I came to say sorry,” he said to Mrs. Knox and to the bird and to the air and to the boy he had been who had tipped a bowl into panic and never forgiven the morning for having a throat. “I’ve made ye into a god I cannot meet. It’s only noise. It’s only the time. I’m learning my manners.” Mrs. Knox looked at him with the practical love good women have for men who are late to their own truths and patted his arm with the hand that has fed dogs and babies and uncooperative men. “Aye well,” she said. “Ye’ll come for eggs then. That’s manners enough.”

There was plastic twine on their fence, the bright orange kind that insists on itself like a shout, so he asked if he might remove it and she said, relieved, that she had been pretending it did not make the apples anxious. He worked with his penknife and with the rhythm of a man untying the world out of a habit that will never stop. He replaced the twine with a length of rope that had come from the first Hush Rope night—good sisal, scratchy with honesty—and heard the fence ease. Inside the coop he tucked his sorry circle onto a nail, hidden, silly, reverent, and Rab, confounded, pecked at his boot with a conversational sort of insult. It was exactly the right absolution.

Later, at the allotments, Mhairi had her stick laid across her knees and a rowan sapling in a pot she had acquired in a way that had not involved asking for a receipt. “For the place we took the thorn,” she said. “Nothing taken stays taken if we can help it.” They went down to the bend and found the hawthorn in its politer mood, the blossom gone, the berries thinking their red into being. They planted the rowan legal and not, with a spit of earth and a blessing too plain to note. The sapling’s leaves had the new green that is never very long. “I stole that lad’s bowl once,” she said, while they patted soil where roots would persuade themselves to be. “Your gran. Did she no tell ye? We were fourteen and immortals. We took her east-water and poured it just to prove we could. The morning had us for a month. We missed the bus to school and the bus to sense. That’s why she hit ye with a cloth that time. She knew the flavour o drowning in a teaspoon. She wasna punishing ye. She was asking the day to give ye back.”

He laughed because the hurt and the help were knotted and there was no teasing one from the other without cutting the rope. The rowan looked like belief you could put your hand on. He promised it, ridiculously, that he would do his part of the compact and not ask it to do more than its leaves could hold. Mhairi’s breath came short after they’d pressed the earth and he found himself fussing, which she accepted in the way of a woman who knows there is pleasure meant in it. “I’m tired enough to let ye,” she said, mock-virtuous. “Dunnae go soft. It’s nae flattering at my age to be treated like a glass that thinks itself crystal.”

The forum had left the town taut and then softened; that was the way with talk. Hush Rope nights grew into the sort of thing you can put on a calendar without the town mocking you. Children learned to tie bowlines and told their mothers what a marlinespike was and won the right to say it in the house. The drains, bored of drama, lay with their mouths open and were not fed. Someone hung a length of braided old feed-bag rope across the mouth of a gap in a fence where a child would otherwise be tempted to fall, and Archie wrote an email with one less swear than he might have used to thank them. PC Lyle came to a Hush night and tied a knot so elegant you would have mistaken it for a jewel if you didn’t know better, and when someone clapped, she bore it as if clapping were a misdemeanor she would let slide this once.

Blaise went quieter. His letters still came, folded into origami of their own significance. Ewan did not read them. He learned to feel them from the other room the way a dog knows the sound of his own name in the mouth of someone who means to ask him for tricks. He slid one under a potted geranium because plants like drama if it’s at the right distance, and promised the cottage that when it was time to burn paper, he would make a festival of it.

On a Friday the flat light came back with its old Highland thrift and he set out toward Bennachie with his usual comfort—early enough that the day could be had for company without being made to sing. Halfway to the corner where the scarf hung on the sign, he stopped because the world had offered him a gift he was not good at accepting: stillness so complete it was not a silence but an agreement to tell the truth. The river went about its business as if he were not there. The wind had taken itself to the hill and was laughing there with the rocks like old men at a funeral who can’t help themselves. In the hedgerow, a bag had gone, or been made, to be a flower—you could see the care in the way the handles had been twisted to a calyx. It tried, even in stillness, to suggest it would be beautiful if only you softened your eyes. He put his hand out and shook his fingers once, and the effort left it like a sigh leaves a child who has decided to sleep after all.

At night he left the window open that inch the cottage and he had agreed was enough. He lay as he did, counting the hinges in him instead of sheep. Somewhere, maybe at the far edge of the Garioch, a rooster took up his part. Ewan opened and shut and opened again, and in the gap he remembered to ask for nothing clever. He thought of the card on the table waiting for its moment, and he thought of to whom he would give it. He thought of Mrs. Knox, of Jay, of Archie, of Lyle, of Mhairi smiling like a ruin that refused to be picturesque. He thought, for the first time without bitterness, of Blaise in a room with white paint on it making neat pen marks on paper and putting sentences in a row like tins on a shelf. He thought, because he had learned the trick and because he had finally stopped thinking it showed weakness, of his own name said back to him by morning in a tone that neither mocked nor begged and called it good.

In the morning he put the sorry circle in his pocket and walked down to the water and pressed it under the rail where the lads sometimes leaned to spit their talk into the river. He said nothing out loud because sometimes the river is not in the mood for your voice. He stood a long while at the Bass, the two streams making their agreement the old way, and he did not ask the day to be better than it meant to be. He did not ask to be forgiven. He offered himself up instead like a man at a threshold who is decent enough to wipe his feet. Beyond the willow a heron made its patient line, and then, righteous as a line can be, lifted into the noise we insist on calling sky. He watched it, and when he went back to the library the third light, unasked, did its job. The boys came for triangles and argued with him about whether shapes can be fair. Mrs. Bruce tapped the glass once, a punctuation. The door breathed. The town went on tying and untying itself.

At the end of the day, with the notices set in their pockets, he found under the mat a thin envelope without pride. He did not take it in. He opened it on the step and let the lid of the world be the table. Inside there was a scrap, not neat, torn from a page that had lost its margins. The writing was still Blaise’s but a little tired at the edges, as if a man had written without a ruler, which encouraged Ewan for no reason he could name. It said only: do you still think the morning is unkind. Under it, a blot where the pen had hesitated, a little human.

He held the paper so the light did not make more of it than it was, and for once he had the right answer ready before the question could whisper him into thinking it needed a speech. He took out a circle, not sorry, not please. He had made a new one that week in a moment of kitchen hubris and not regretted it since. He wrote the word on the back of the letter and slid it under the mat where Blaise’s polite theft had left a space. Enough, it said, and for the first time he felt the word not as a stop but as a completion. He shut the door and the latch made its old faith statement. Out beyond the birches someone’s rooster, generous fool, did his duty, and in his bed Ewan’s laugh, a small breathy thing, was accepted by the dark without charge.
