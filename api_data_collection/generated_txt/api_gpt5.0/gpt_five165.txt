The morning Lagos air was thin and gray, soft as the lid of a pot lifting slowly, reluctantly, over someone’s stew. Kunle Ajayi swept under the almond tree in the compound with a short broom, the bristles binding dust together into small stubborn galaxies. He moved in arcs. He moved listening. Every scrape produced a note, every brush found its echo. Somewhere beyond the gates a hawker sang out, “Agege bread! Hot bread!” and there was the tinny cough of a generator that had been woken same as every day—as if waking were punishment. Somewhere above, a baby whimpered and turned, and Kunle paused his sweeping to tilt his face toward the third-floor balcony, the one where the morning glories had claimed the railing like optimistic fingers.

“Kun-lee!” a voice whispered sharply from the shadows of the staircase. Mama Toun, wrapper knotted at her waist, held a bucket on her hip and watched him with that squint of a woman who has already judged you but is generous enough to let your day begin.

“Good morning, ma,” he sang, without thinking. The greeting became melody, a soft descending scale. “Good morning, ma-ma To-oun.”

She clicked her tongue. “Sing, sing. One day you will sing and forget to sweep. This compound will grow mango on the staircase.”

Kunle laughed and kept sweeping. “If mango grows, we will pluck and chop. Everybody go chop mango.”

“You this man,” she said, already smiling, and clucked away.

He finished the first pile. He dragged it into the rusted metal dustpan and tilted it into the bin slick with last night’s damp. Above, the baby made an uncertain chirp. Ire. Two months, and already the girl had found ways to command a room. Already the landlord, Chief Ojo, had pretended to be uninterested when he begged for quiet and added, “Children don’t listen to the laws of quiet, sha.”

The alloy door at the back of the building flung open and Bisi appeared with her wrap-around robe and her headscarf a bright lemon that the sun wanted to be. She held Ire against her chest so that only cheeks and an eye peeked out, dark and exact. “Your daughter does not respect Saturday,” she said, but there was a smile tucked in the corner of her mouth.

“My daughter respects only her stomach,” Kunle answered, grateful. This was the ritual. He would be grateful in the way of a man who had been allowed to choose goodness.

“Come,” Bisi said, descending, settling on the steps. He leaned the broom against the pillar and went to take the baby. Ire was warm and smelled like milk with a hint of the powder they had bought in Ojuelegba market, the one that claimed to protect and did.

“She was calm when you were singing yesterday night,” Bisi said, trying to keep the neutral tone of a suggestion. “The one with—” she hummed a line of his, the one he had written on the back of a bill while standing in the line for water last week.

“Hmm,” he said, suddenly shy. He had always been shy with the things that mattered. The broom, the rent ledger, the swing of a gate key—these were easy. The melody he carried in his mouth since he was ten—when his mother used her comb to keep time while frying dodo—that was not easy.

A door creaked and a child galloped down the stairs, her braids flicking the air with a rhythmic thwap. “Uncle Kunle! Uncle!” she said, stopping dead at his feet to spread her fingers, as if showing off long, glossy lines.

“Ah, who is this fine geh? It’s not Toun’s last born that is now a model,” Kunle said. “Take it easy, o.”

“I am running race with time,” the girl announced solemnly.

“Time no get leg, my dear. Better you race your mama’s cane,” Bisi laughed.

The compound was waking. From somewhere came the mournful bleating of a goat. The half-open shop at the gate sputtered into life as Aisha rolled up the grill, her husband Baba Sala already arguing the internal dividends of a pack of recharge cards. A motorbike hissed past the gate. The city stretched herself, joints snapping, and began to be the city again, a million conversations layered so thickly that silence felt like a rumor.

Kunle rocked Ire and sang something wordless, a thread of sound that had come long before any words. A tune that knew him. He watched Bisi’s feet, slender, splayed slightly in her slippers, the left big toe with a little nick she had gotten from a broken tile the week they moved in. He would remember that toe later, after a while, when it felt like the world was remembering him but not always kindly.

Just there on the second floor, leaning on the railing with a plastic cup of zobo, was Mr. Ogunbiyi. “Caretaker!” he called, that wicked grin that belonged to the men who had lived many decades in Lagos and had learned how to extract humor from every inconvenience. “My light is blinking like Yoruba demon. The phase is touching itself.”

“NEPA will come later in the day,” Kunle said. “I’ll go to the junction first. The transformer trip maybe, or the line man is doing—”
“—is doing mistery,” Mr. Ogunbiyi finished and laughed. “Kai. Lagos.”

“Wait first.” He adjusted the baby and reached for something that had been leaning against the door jamb all morning. A white envelope with a logo that looked like a star, a microphone thrust into its heart like a knife. “They posted this yesterday evening,” he said to Bisi, a little breathless. He had hid it from himself, as though he could delay both hope and its cousin disappointment by breeding a small bureaucracy of secrets.

Bisi’s face went still, and then she said softly, “Open it now, na.”

He balanced Ire in the crook of his elbow and slid his fingernail along the paper. The glue resisted, theatrically. He had to tug, and the corner tore. He pulled out a heavy card, glossy, far too official to live in their small room. The words sat tall and eager: Congratulations, Kunle AJAYI! We are delighted to inform you—

“Ah!” Bisi half-gasped. It felt like the compound paused. Even the goat stopped bleating. Above, Mama Toun leaned and actually spilled a splash of water from her bucket onto the staircase, a sin she would ordinarily scold others for.

He read the words aloud. Invited. Live final. Voices of Naija. Full expenses. Lagos to Abuja. Four days. Travel documents will be forwarded to your mail.

“Ah-ahn,” said Aisha at the gate, and clapped the grill lightly, as if it were a drum. “Is now that we will be seeing star o.”

“You see now,” Mr. Ogunbiyi called. “He will be forming, he will not be greeting us again. When he sings we will pretend we don’t know him.”

“Abeg, abeg,” Kunle murmured, but his voice had already shifted, lighter, as though someone had unslung a weight and set it aside for him to admire. He laughed. Lightning ran through his chest. The card glinted. The baby hiccuped, unconcerned.

“Let us not shout too much,” Bisi said, even as she reached to touch the card like a blessing. “We will still pray. There is plenty journey between paper and stage. Are you hearing me?”

He nodded and looked at the small plane of Ire’s forehead. “We will pray.”

They went upstairs to their room which was two rooms, technically, separated by a thin plywood wall painted a defiant blue. The bed had been pushed against the far wall to make room for Ire’s tiny crib, an inheritance from Bisi’s cousin in Mushin who had once thought two children were enough. On the folding table lay bills and a stack of leaflets Kunle had made for church events. On the window a soft film of dust, always returning, that he wiped every day. The room smelled like a place that had held many breaths.

They sat on the bed. Bisi tucked Ire to her breast and the baby latched greedily, sighing. The sound knocked something in Kunle’s chest so that he couldn’t sit anymore; he got up and wandered, his body too small suddenly for what his heart wanted to do.

“Do you remember when we went to Bariga,” Bisi said, looking up at him. “That night? When you said you wanted to audition and I said okay, let’s go now before your brain changes?”

He laughed. He had nearly changed his mind. The registration had been online. He had been too timid to ask for help. The girl at the cybercafé by Shitta had guided him in that easy-offhand way that made him think of sisters he never had. He’d filled out the form with palms too damp to hold the mouse. He had almost put his name as Ajayi Kunle but the form wanted first name first. He had almost not gone that day in Bariga when his landlord had asked him to fix the broken lock. He had almost decided that a man had one height in this life: what he was born into. He had nearly almost nearly.

“You were so angry that day,” he said now, smiling. “At that man on the bus who pushed you with his bag. Ehn, the way you told him you will break his face—”

“Ah-ahn, I didn’t say that,” Bisi protested.

“You said it, o! You told him his mother will not recognize his face again.” He laughed, the sound tumbling through the room. “And he said ‘sister, take it easy now’ and then he found me in the crowd afterwards to warn me that my wife is hot pepper. Me, I told him I like pepper.”

Bisi rolled her eyes. “Eat your pepper. But remember, the way you were shaking before you sang? You almost swallowed that microphone.”

He had. The small stage had glowed under cheap lights. There were fans in corners blowing hot air. He had felt his body floating away from him. But then he had opened his mouth and the noise from the road, the body of his life, had arranged itself into music the way the rain arranges a dusty yard into something that smells like a story. He had sung about the road from Ajegunle to Ojota at dawn. He had sung about his mother’s kantangolo tree that had never quite made up its mind if it wanted to be orange or grapefruit. He had sung about God, but he had sung the way you talk to a friend you see every day, not the way you talk to a banker. And the room had become hot as breath and then gone quiet as prayer and afterwards the lady with the sharp bob had said, “Young man, you have something.”

They had followed him with cameras since that moment, sometimes. They had sent him texts that began, “Hello Star!” and he had laughed and showed them to Bisi. He had not told plenty people in the compound at first; you didn’t bring your dreams into the courtyard too early. The sun had a way of bleaching things before they dried.

“I’m thinking about my father,” he said aloud, not even sure why. He perched on the edge of the table and looked at the envelope on the bed. His father somewhere in Sango-Ota, a small repair shop, a radio that was always half-open like a cut, groaning under the weight of static. His father who had loved songs but had not loved him singing. “He will say, ‘Kunle, don’t disgrace me with all this. Be serious.’ He will say, ‘Music cannot fill a pot.’”

Bisi made that noise she makes when she does not want to fight with a ghost. “You can call him. Or you don’t call him. Your chest will tell you what to do.”

“My chest is loud this morning,” he said, and he closed his eyes and saw the stage he had not yet felt under his feet. He saw a crescent of lights. He saw a sea of hands like cornfields. He saw himself in a jacket he could not afford—any jacket—and he felt the thrill of being seen and not just looked at. When he opened his eyes, Bisi was looking too as if she could see it.

“You know what will happen?” she said. “The same thing I told you before. You will sing as if you are in our room. You will sing like a whisper that everyone can hear.”

“I will sing like a whisper,” he repeated, testing the words. “And the judges will argue among themselves as if they are market women buying fish.”

“Foolish boy,” she laughed.

They ate boiled plantains for breakfast, soft and glistening with the oil Kunle had kept aside for Sundays. He had the envelope propped against the spice tin like a spectator. Every time he looked up, the gold letters winked at him. The compound kept coming by, a parade. A knock, a “so we heard o,” a small “congratulations” like a blessing tied around his wrist. Even Chief Ojo descended from his first floor to stand in the yard with a mug of tea and pronounce, “Hmm. Even caretaker can be celebrity.” He said it the way men who own buildings say everything: as though the roof of the world were mortgaged to them. But his eyes were soft. He said, “You will not forget this compound.”

“I cannot forget us,” Kunle answered. He meant it. He meant that the smell of the corridor early in the morning when everyone had their doors open would live on his skin forever. He meant that the way Aisha rolled her eyes before she laughed was his own small piece of Lagos. He meant that he had been caretaker and caretaker meant something—man-who-holds-keys, man-who-knows-which-plug-to-adjust, man-who-pours-water-on-argument-before-it-takes-fire.

“But you will still sweep,” Mama Toun said, wagging a clothespin at him.

“I will even sweep Abuja,” he promised. People laughed in that easy, continental way Nigerians laugh at the mention of official places.

By evening, when the sun grew a little apologetic, Kunle went to choir practice. The church was ten streets away if you counted by heart and not by roads. He walked with his hands in his pockets, head down like he was keeping ideas from escaping. The church hall was bright, the fluorescent bars making everyone look a little unreal, as if they were performing themselves. Adaeze, the choir mistress, raised her eyebrow when he arrived.

“So the fame is making you late, abi,” she said, but she hugged him quickly afterward, the kind of hug that says something and doesn’t.

“You people have planning committee for the congratulations clap,” Kunle teased, looking at the faces that had been his small audience on Wednesday and Friday nights. He had found refuge here ever since he’d taken the job at the compound and moved out of his mother’s house. On some nights, when his bones remembered what it had been to be a child without the tightness of worry lodged in the throat, the choir would break mid-song, and he would start a new line, a new thing, and they would sing it as if it had always existed.

“The only planning committee is prayer,” Adaeze said. “Sing that new one. The one with the ‘come, come’—that one.”

He sang. He closed his eyes and let the line unwind, pulled from the small spool at the back of his throat. He sang, and even the harsh lights grew less annoyed. When he opened his eyes, he saw Adaeze looking at him with that expression he had seen before—something like admiration but tilted by something else. He looked away.

After practice, as they stacked the metal chairs against the wall and someone prayed the long closing prayer that gathered every possible event in the universe, Adaeze walked out with him into the night.

“I heard,” she said. “About the final. Eh-ehn.” The words were round and friendly.

“Hmm,” he said. Did he want to grin foolishly? Possibly.

“You will do well,” she said. “You will not start saying ‘fans’ and posting videos of yourself shaking waist.”

Kunle laughed. “Which waist? There is no waist here, see.” He slashed a hand across his midsection, making a face.

Adaeze laughed. A motorbike rumbled by, its lights jittering on their faces for a moment and then gone. “When are you traveling?”

“They said in the mail: four days before the show. So next Friday.”

“Next Friday,” she repeated. “We will do a small prayer-send-off. Bring Bisi. Bring the baby. We will anoint the baby’s head so she will stop waking her mother at night.” It was a way of asking, quietly, if the family was well, if the newness had not grown dangerous.

“Bring us all,” Kunle said. “We will eat rice. We will fight over small meat.”

Adaeze smiled, then did the thing she sometimes did: she reached to touch the back of his arm, lightly, as though to check if his skin was really there. “God bless you,” she said. “Don’t look at the size of the stage. The stage should look at you.”

“Yes, ma,” Kunle said, teasing, but his chest felt a little too raw suddenly. The night hung close to his skin.

On his way back home he passed the kiosk where they fried akara and watched the woman drop spoon-sculpted globes of paste into the oil, the sizzle a joyous kind of violence. He bought five for Bisi, two for himself. He stood one leg on the plank bench, talking to a danfo driver about the price of spare parts as if he knew anything about it. He delayed, a little, savoring the feeling of being a man with news. When he finally returned to the compound, the lights were out, the corridor a cave. He heard Ire before he reached the door; that determined cry that said she trusted the world to come because it had come before. Bisi’s silhouette against the open window was a cut-out from a book he would keep picking up.

They ate. They told each other lies about how calm they were. They planned the travel bag—the one with the handle that sticks. They argued for ten minutes about whether Abuja will be cold, even though both of them have never been, and finally agreed to pack one sweater. Bisi rolled his shirts, the nice one from Christmas, the one that made his skin look brighter. She put a sprig of something that the old women swore kept bad spirits away under the bag’s lining. She said, “It cannot hurt,” and he did not argue.

At midnight, when the building sighed into sleep, the generator at the back did its final cough and died. The quiet came like a visitor, and they made room for it on the bed. Bisi had her head tucked against his chest, one arm stretched over Ire’s crib, the way mothers’ arms do even in sleep, an autonomous animal watching the boundary. Kunle lay awake and watched the rectangle of the window opening and closing as clouds passed and freed the moon. He rehearsed the notes. He rehearsed the walk. He rehearsed the thing beyond rehearsal: that he could stand in a harsh light and not disappear.

The next day was a rehearsal of a different bitter kind. Morning insisted on being ordinary because it had no respect for envelopes. Kunle went to the market and haggled for tomatoes with a woman who called him stingy and then pinched his cheek like an old aunt after he gave her exactly what she had asked for. He carried jerrycans to the borehole at the end of the street and waited, the line a long snake coiled around itself, men gossiping like birds. He fixed the lock on Mr. Ogunbiyi’s bathroom door, cursing a screw that had been made by lazy men with hangovers. He unfolded and refolded the envelope in his pocket.

At noon, his mother called. He stared at the display: “Mummy.” He took the call, and her voice came through crackly. “Kúnlé mi,” she said, and there was a softness he recognized instantly, the special sugar she kept for him even when she was scolding. “I saw something on TV. Is it you? They are showing boys singing. Your face is not far from that boy’s face.”

“It is me, ma,” he said, suddenly twelve. He described it. He made it small so she would not worry. He made it big so she would be proud.

“Ha,” she said. “Since when have I been telling you to join the choir, you will form big boy. Now all of Lagos will be choir. You will not forget your Bible, sha. You will not be carrying that your voice to places voice should not go. And you will greet your father when he returns.”

“I will greet him,” he said and felt the duck of his heart. “How is he?”

“He is fine. People are bringing radios that they have used to boil tea. He will come home later.” There was a pause, as though she had things and the pause would bring them forward. “Bisi? The baby?”

“They are well. Baby is very fine.”

“Hmm. Tell your wife I greet her. Tell her I will come and carry the baby. I will come and put my nose on the baby’s hair.” The last words had a sudden longing that felt like prayer.

After he put down the phone, he stood in the corridor for a long time, watching the dust dance in shafts of light. He thought of his father’s hands, always smelling like iron and oil. He thought of his father the day he had told him he wanted to leave school a year early to start making money. He thought of the way the man had looked at him then, like a stethoscope placed on his chest. He thought of the time he had heard his father singing along to an old Ebenezer Obey song and had watched his mouth form joy. He thought of how some men are kind and do not know the shape of kindness on their own faces.

He went back inside. Bisi was asleep on her side, Ire a small comma in the crook of her legs. The fan turned lazily above them. He thought: this is the room. This is the world. He sat with his back against the wardrobe and wrote lines on a paper he had saved for a special thing. He wrote about Saturday morning and sweeping. He wrote about the compound’s heartbeat. He wrote about how you could carry a city in your mouth and spit it out as a song, and people would taste their own lives and not even know it was yours.

“Kunle,” Bisi said, waking, her voice a rustle. “What are you doing?”

“Writing,” he said.

“Bring me the paper when you are done. I want to underline where I need to cry when you sing it.”

“Comedian,” he said, smiling.

On Wednesday they brought their bag to the church. The choir sang loud and off-key and joyful because sometimes it was not about precision but about the noise of love. They circled Kunle and Bisi and baby, and the elderly women laid hands on Ire with a gentleness that made tears prick the back of his throat. Pastor Joseph said, “May this man never confuse platform with purpose,” and Kunle wanted to laugh because the pastor always talked like that, but the words also entered his skin. Adaeze sang something small and sweet, and Bisi squeezed his fingers three times in a code they had invented under the covers: I love you. He squeezed back four: I love you more.

Afterwards, they ate jollof and argued about who made the better version, the pastor’s wife or the usher who had a new Brazilian weave that caught the light like a net. They took pictures on someone’s phone, the flash too bright. A baby—a different one—howled from hunger at the back of the room, and three women rose at once like an instinctive army.

When they walked home, the night air had that metallic sweetness Lagos sometimes gets when it has not rained and wants to. Kunle’s phone buzzed. A new message from the competition people: Please confirm your travel details. Another with a PDF attachment: Outline of Final: Songs, Themes, Logistics, Press. He showed Bisi, suddenly aware that this thing had levels. Many levels. He imagined men in neat shirts sitting in AC rooms writing the word “logistics” and felt a little dizzy.

“Don’t let them confuse you,” Bisi said, tapping the screen. “You will sing. That is your work. The rest is the rest.” She took the phone and typed out his details because she had always typed better. She used to work in a small office before Ire came, and she could make a keyboard go like rain on zinc.

Four days had a way of being both slow and wild. He packed and repacked. The landlord came by with the sly suggestion that perhaps they might mention, casually, the name of the street on television, for promotional reasons. He mended the washing line that had sagged under the weight of too many ambitions. He bought biscuits to quiet his anxiety. He sat with his mother on Thursday evening at the back of their old house in Ketu, the leaves whispering, and his father sitting inside, the radio grumbling the news. He had called ahead, and his mother had said, “Come,” as though he had asked if he might breathe.

His father did not salute the victory of his son, not with his mouth, and yet he made the special stew, the one he saved for friends. He asked three times if Kunle would be paid, and when Kunle said, “Maybe later,” he scowled in that way he had invented to pretend he was not secretly amused. They sat with the stew and the evening and the awkwardness like a third son between them. It was not perfect. It was not nothing.

“Sing,” his mother requested finally, strange and beautiful. “Sing small here. Let your father hear the song in our house first. Let the roof be jealous of the stadium.”

He sang. He sang with his eyes open because to close them would have been to cry. His father did not smile, but his hand, on the table, tapped once, twice, without permission. When the last note threaded out of the air and disappeared, there was a silence that would feed him later.

Friday morning came in like a rush-hour bus, full and refusing to stop completely. Bisi straightened the bed and then un-straightened it because superstition. “Do not finish all your cleaning,” she joked weakly. They took a taxi to the airport—small extravagant thing—for the first time together, and the driver had the radio turned to some show where a comedian wore a judge’s wig and was scolding the nation. In the back seat, Ire slept and woke and slept, the movement of the car a lullaby.

At the airport, so many lights. So much shining, the floors reflecting the world back to them like a big joke. So many people with bags and faces arranged like they knew where they were going. Bisi clutched his hand once, twice, the small squeeze that meant maybe I am scared but I am also un-afraid. They hugged at the security check in a way that drew smiles and mild mockery—“Ah-ah, travel three days only, see hug like relocation” from the guard, and then he waved Kunle through like a man grateful for a good love to watch.

He stood at the glass and watched Bisi and Ire on the other side until they had to leave. He drained the last of the bottled water he had bought. He read the PDF again, his eyes glazing at “press call at 12:00” and “technical rehearsal” and “backline and DI.” He picked up his boarding pass and put it down. He called Bisi. She had not yet left the airport; she had gone to find pepper soup at a kiosk that promised to deliver “best taste in West Africa.”

“I’m about to go,” he said.

“Go well,” she said. Their voices were already the beginning of some different kind of distance.

“Sing for me on the phone tonight,” she added. “Just small.”

“I will,” he said.

The flight was an elongated breath. He stared out at the wing and imagined it was the blade of a giant fan. He remembered lying on the cold floor as a boy during the harmattan and imagining the ceiling fan swinging down and chopping the room into slices of cool. He put his head back and closed his eyes and counted heartbeats. The man beside him read a devotional, lips moving. When they landed, the man said, “We thank God,” and smiled like they had built the aircraft together.

Abuja was wide. That was his first thought. The roads spread out like arms held open. The air felt less crowded, like you could swing your shoulders without hitting someone else, and it made him nervous. The people in branded T-shirts met him at the baggage claim, their smiles professionally bright. “Kunle! Great to see you,” said a woman with a clipboard and an accent that slid around like melted sugar.

They put him in a van with two other contestants, boys with hair like competitions and smiles like slices. They looked at him and looked away, calculating. He felt a small churn of defiance and said, “How far now,” and they laughed and relaxed slightly. One of them was named Tari. One was named Bala. They smelled like cologne and panic. The van hummed them to the hotel.

The hotel was taller than any building had reason to be. The glass doors rushed open as if eager to swallow them. There was a smell of new carpet and something else he couldn’t place. He collected his key card and kept touching it in his pocket as though it might disappear. His room was a small sun—everything bright and deliberate. The bed floated on a gray sea. He stood in the middle and turned once, twice as if to rub his body into the corners of the space and make it his.

He called Bisi immediately. She put Ire to the phone so he could hear the baby’s breath. He spoke nonsense, the way fathers speak to infants when nobody is listening: “Who is my fine big small girl. Who will wear red shoes. Who will scatter her father’s head with laughter.” He heard Bisi’s soft snort and he said, “I miss you,” and she said, “We are here,” and the room shifted slightly and became bearable.

Downstairs there was the press call. There was the line of cameras. There were questions: What did music mean to him? Who was his greatest influence? How did it feel to represent real Nigerians? He said words. He did not remember them afterward, only the flashbulb staccato. He remembered a man who asked, “How do you think your life will change if you win?” and he had said, “I will still be myself,” and the man had made a face like that was the wrong answer. He remembered a woman with eyes like cooled metal who said, “Sing two lines,” and he had, and the whole room had softened.

Night came. It came with a hotel dinner and laughter too loud and whispers in corridors and someone crying behind a door and the soft knock of a crew member asking, “All okay?” Proximity, then isolation, then proximity again. It felt like being inside a bell.

At midnight, Kunle stood by the window. The city below was not Lagos; it did not argue as loudly. He held the phone, and the screen lit his face like a private moon. He called Bisi. It rang three times, then clicked through. He greeted the silence. “It’s me,” he said. “I told you I would sing.”

“Sing,” she breathed, the word a hammock.

And he did. A soft thing, a song with no decisions in it, a song that was a long vowel, then a shorter one, then the breaking of sound into its component parts. He sang his house, his courtyard, the almond tree, the baby’s hiccup, the smell of akara, the broken washing line, the sandals by the door, the stubborn light in the hallway, the hand on his arm after choir. He sang the envelope and the tear in its edge. He sang his father tapping fingers once, twice. He sang with his heart bare and not ashamed. When he finished, the line was silent like a held breath. Then he heard her, the soft catch and release.

“You did it,” she said. “Now sleep.”

He lay down, finally, and sleep crept in a little reluctantly, then took him.

Morning again, but a new one. There were rehearsals with men who wore headsets and said things like “we’ll black the stage at soundcheck.” There was a place taped off on the floor for him to stand to catch the light just right. “Don’t walk past that,” a woman warned and pointed at the black tape like it was a cliff. There were jokes and nervous laughter. He met the contestants again in better light and asked questions that made their faces open: “Who taught you your first song?” “What’s the food you miss most?” He collected their stories the way he collected keys. He kept them safe in his pocket.

Sometime between the run-through and the wardrobe fitting, a producer leaned in and said, “Kunle? Your segment—one request. We like when contestants tell a story. Think about something tugging. The caretaking, the baby. You know. The journey. Don’t be shy.”

He nodded, anger and gratitude wrestling in his belly. He thought of his mother’s face. He thought of people who watched television after a long day and cried.

He called Bisi at lunch, but the call went to voicemail. He tried again. The line rang and rang and died. He tried again. Finally, she picked up, breathless.

“Sorry,” she said. “Mama Toun came with plantain and I had to hide the good one.”

He laughed, relief flooding through him in a wave so visible that Tari nudged him and whispered, “Girlfriend?”

“Wife,” Kunle mouthed back.

That evening, as the stage hands uncoiled cables like snakes and the lights warmed up, Kunle sat in a quiet corner and did the thing his mother had taught him: put his palm on his chest and speak to his breath. “We are here,” he whispered. “We are here.” He didn’t know if it was prayer or biology. He didn’t need to.

A text buzzed. Unfamiliar number: “Hello. This is the landlord. Your light is on in the corridor. Also, congratulations.” The second sentence felt earned by the first. He sent a thank you with a smiley face that made him feel twelve. Another buzz: Adaeze: “Sing from your lungs. Don’t leave God backstage.” He sent a heart.

Then, a call. His mother again. “I am watching the adverts,” she said. “They are telling us to buy soap that will wash away sin.” She sighed. “Your father is pretending not to watch. But his eyes are jealous of the TV.”

“I will be on tomorrow,” he said.

“Hmm. Tomorrow,” she repeated, as if tasting the word.

The final rehearsal ended with a burst of artificial smoke that made him think of harmattan bonfires. The stage manager clapped. People dispersed into the corridors like water through a sieve. Back in his room, Kunle put the selected shirt on a hanger and looked at it as though it might answer back. He put Bisi’s scarf on the bedside lamp. He sat on the bed, phone in his palm, awake and sure that he would not sleep, then slept.

On the morning of the final, his body felt like a kettle that had already boiled. He had never needed less coffee. He floated through the briefings. He let people attach small microphones to his face, hairline, heart. He laughed at the makeup person’s jokes because they were good or because his mouth needed to move. He kept touching his phone to check the time even though time was not in his pocket.

The show began in an eruption. The host shouted into a universe that was made to echo. Names were called. People screamed. Producers flitted like bees. Kunle stood in the wings and looked at the white taped cross on the floor that would tether him to light. Then he looked at the set—which looked like a city without dust—and thought of Bisi’s toe again, the nick on her big toe, and he smiled because the mind is a wild dog; it runs where it runs.

Then he sang. The first line went out like the first sweep of a broom. He could not see faces, only the suggestion of faces—he sang to the space between. He sang the thing he had written in the room, adjusted for some small vanity, “we will climb water” amusing the judges. He felt his voice catch once and then steady. He did not think of his father. He thought of the tap at the end of the street, of men waiting, of patience.

When he stopped, when the last note hung trembling like a drop from a leaf, the sound came back to him in a crash: applause, a pressurized ocean. The judges made faces. One smiled, one pretended to not be impressed, one leaned in as if to take the note into her mouth and taste it. He laughed, because what else. He bowed. He left the circle of white tape. He did not fall.

Backstage, someone squeezed his shoulder. Tari. “Guy,” he said. “You cooked that thing.” Then he ran on to his own fate.

Kunle went to a quiet hallway and called Bisi. He could already hear her voice before she spoke. “You did it,” she said. “You did. That Mummy judge, the one with earrings like satellite dish? She nearly cried.”

Kunle laughed, the relief making his knees strange. “I didn’t see anything. I only saw white light.”

“We scream,” she said. “Even Ire. Imagine. The whole compound shook. Even Nepa brought light at the correct time. Do and come home.”

“I will—” he began, and then a hand touched his arm and the stage manager hissed his name. They needed him for something else, a photo, a thing. “Later,” he said hastily. “Kiss the baby.”

“Sleep,” she said.

He hung up and ran down a corridor lit too much. The world became a lens, then a hallway, then a room used by nobody for anything real. He had done it. He had stepped under lights and remained himself. He felt a great calm, like someone had set down a bag he didn’t know he had been carrying.

He would sleep tonight. He would. He would hold the phone at his ear and listen to the breath of his wife and child. He would think of nothing but the taste of success in his mouth, metallic and sweet.

The message came, soft and familiar, the same chime as always, the same square of light on the screen. It was from Bisi. A simple thing.

Call me. It was missing a full stop. Her messages rarely missed full stops. He frowned and called, walking toward the quiet of his room.

The phone rang and rang and then clicked. Her breath was wrong. He knew it before she said anything because you learn the map of someone's breathing. You carry it.

“Kunle,” she said, and there it was: the tremble in the vowel.

“What happened?” he asked, already moving faster. He closed the door to his room behind him, shut out the voices, the laughter, the stage manager’s chatter.

“It’s Ire,” she said, and the room became a train station from the old movies, a place where the sound of an announcement tolls through the air and you understand that your life has been arranged differently without your permission.

“Tell me,” he said. “Don’t make it a big thing. Tell me small, quickly.”

“She was sleeping,” Bisi said, not crying, the terrible calm of fresh fear. “She was on the bed, beside me. I got up to pee. It was small time, I locked the door. And when I came out—Kunle, when I came out, she—she—”

The line cracked. A door knocked inside the phone.

“Say it,” he whispered. “Say it so we can undo it.”

“She is not here,” Bisi said. “The baby is not here.” Her voice broke then, and in the breaking there was the knowledge that the building had not fallen on them; their world had.

He closed his eyes. The room, the bed, the city on the other side of the glass—that everything became both enormous and irrelevant. He could hear a tapping on the door. He could hear, far away, the host calling someone’s name into a sea. He could hear his own breathing, loud and too fast.

“I’m coming,” he said, but the words could not cross the distance between them fast enough. “I’m coming now.” He found his shoes and his passport and the envelope and then dropped the envelope because he realized it was only paper. He put the phone between shoulder and ear and began to move through the corridors like a man who had just remembered what legs were for. He moved as though speed could return small things to their places. He moved with a song unspooling in his chest and laying itself down like a small, desperate path across the world.He walked faster than he had ever allowed himself to walk in a corridor like that, not running only because something inside him insisted that the body must obey certain laws or everything would scatter. The phone was hot against his cheek. He said Bisi’s name again and again and then, because he needed action to hold the panic down, his voice arranged itself into instructions. Check the balcony. Do not touch anything more than you already have. Call the landlord. Wake Aisha. Knock Mama Toun’s door. Lock the main door if it can be locked. Look at the window latch. Does it look broken? He heard her breathing answer him—staccato and close—and the rattle of keyring on wood as she obeyed and said yes and said no and said she did not know because when a hole bursts open in your world, certainty is the first thing that falls through. A woman with a headset intercepted him at the elevator and tried to kiss the air near his face with a smile that had been trained, saying the word “post” and the word “statement,” putting her palms up as if to press his panic flat. He moved around her and kept moving, and the lift doors seemed to take days to close and then drop, and when the doors opened he walked through the lobby like a man who had not learned the trick of staying inside his skeleton.

In Lagos, time swerved. Bisi stood in their room in a darkness that was not dark because the corridor light bled past the door and the city never allowed night to be full. The bed was a square aching with absence. The window filter cloth breathed in and out of the frame as if the room had lungs. She had not screamed at first because her mind had refused to translate what her eyes insisted on offering. The bathroom tiles were still damp under her feet from where she had splashed; the scent of the small purple soap they had bought because it was on sale sat accusingly in the air. She went to the door and put her hand on the lock as if it might tell her a different story. She remembered turning it. She remembered the tiny click. The lock was still engaged. She walked to the window and pushed the curtain aside and the morning glories were not where they should be—a tangle in one corner was bent, almost plucked, a little snarl of green with fresh bruises on the stems. There was a black mark on the outside paint where a rubber sole had kissed, one, two. The corridor, when she opened the door, lunged at her with its perfumed silence and its dust motes. She thought her throat had forgotten how to call, and then her call came up of its own accord, a raw thing, not a womanly thing or a careful thing, and she cried, “Help!” and “Ire!” and the compound’s ears, primed always for trouble as well as gossip, woke instantly.

Doors opened with speed they did not ordinarily remember. Aisha ran before her slippers had found her feet and shouted “what?” without commas and went to the gate like a bullet, letting the grill bang back like metal applause. Baba Sala threw off a wrapper and came out with a torch that had last shone in the last petrol scarcity. The goat bleated an opinion nobody needed and then went quiet as if even goats understood the size of certain calamities. Chief Ojo thundered down his stairs in a singlet that had seen better years and tried to find the deep voice he reserved for tenants who were not paying, but what came out of him was soft and animal. Two of the boys who sold recharge cards outside disappeared into the street with that frantic usefulness that boys summon when the world calls for it. A rumor bloomed instantly because Lagos had never had a famine of rumor; someone whispered that ritualists patrolled this zone at night; someone else swore she had heard a whistle at midnight that she did not recognize. The whistle, the unlocked gate, the careless mother—words began to gather and align themselves like a mob and to push toward Bisi, and before they could reach her, Mama Toun inserted herself between them and Bisi like a wall built without plan but built strong. “Do not speak it,” she said, low, and her eyes were two flints. “We are not doing blame on top someone whose head is on fire.”

Kunle was a deficiency in the shape of a man in front of the show people; he saw their lips move and the names they made with his name were not for his taking. The clipboard woman came again, and something in her face unclicked when he said, clearly now, my daughter is missing, she is two months, she was in Lagos, we are in Abuja, I am going now. A small war took place in a quick corridor where contracts met conscience. Somebody’s mouth said liability. Somebody else’s mouth said compassion. He started to walk toward the hotel doors not knowing if tickets can be conjured by forward motion. Tari appeared like a mirror and put a hand on his shoulder, not to stop but to steady. “Take this,” Tari said, pushing folded bills into his palm with an embarrassment that we reserve for gifts we wish were bigger. Bala scribbled a number that belonged to a cousin who drove night taxi at the Lagos end and said, “Call him. He will cut road for you.” The clipboards rearranged their priorities. The headset woman was suddenly human and said, “I will get you on the next flight,” and the word “I” made a roof over his head for a second. She ran, her headset bobbing like a bird, and he stood still and shook so hard he thought his bones would spill out through the pockets of his shirt.

At the airport gates, the security man recognized his face and smiled with that Lagos smile that says, you think I do not see you because you are on TV, but I still see you, and then the man's smile fell off when he noticed the shape of the eyes in front of him. Kunle said a sentence that was entire breath and no punctuation and it was enough; hands moved him to the front of a line that he did not feel guilty about skipping because guilt was too expensive now. On the way to the plane he called his mother and wasted no time on salutations because sometimes even sweetness had to wait. She did not understand at first because there are certain sentences that must be said twice before the world allows them. The second time made her make a sound like cloth tearing. He heard the radio inside the house go stuttering into silence. “Come,” his mother said after a suspended length of breathing. “We are standing. Come.” When his father came on the line, the man’s voice was a saw trying not to cut. “I am calling people,” he said, and the old networks he carried like a net across his shoulders woke from where they had been sleeping. Neighbors who owed him small money were suddenly ready men. The mechanic who never had time for anything began to have time. The stubborn landlord from Ketu called a police DPO he used to drink with. In the plane, Kunle watched the angry beauty of the wing and felt time thicken like pap, and he put his head back and said the only prayer his chest could make which was name repeated, name repeated, like a drum.

The compound had a police presence—not siren, not too much flourish—just men with notebooks and tilted caps and tiredness that rested like a separate person on their shoulders. They took down facts as if facts would agree to sit still. They stood in Kunle and Bisi’s room and looked at the bed and looked at the window and looked at the mother and then looked at each other and wrote something that looked like distrust. One of them asked Bisi twice if the baby had not perhaps been taken by a relative, a mother-in-law, a jealous friend who wished to teach her a lesson, and his mouth made a small snide tilt when he said “teach.” Another asked her if she had any quarrel with a neighbor and the man’s eyes wandered quickly to Aisha because something about this city taught men to suspect women who laughed easily. Bisi folded her wrapper tighter around her waist and said no and then added that she would bite her own arm before she harmed her daughter. The one with the notebook asked for keys and asked who had keys and there, for the first time that night, everything tilted and pointed at a space where Kunle should be. “Caretaker,” they said. “Keys,” they said, and their pens paused like they expected a confession to float up from the floorboards. “My husband is in Abuja,” Bisi said, and the relief when the room crowd murmured and confirmed his celebrity and his absence was an ugly relief because it came shackled to public knowledge that would now refuse to sit quietly in a corner.

Traffic held Kunle in its fist and squeezed slowly, the red lights like carnivals he did not want to attend. The driver, Bala’s cousin, drove like a man who had learned to argue with brake pedals and won only sometimes. Lagos outside the window was obscene in its normalcy; men still laughed with their chests in roadside bars, a noodle cart still hissed joyfully at the corner, a child still chased a yellow plastic ball that had decided to become wind. He wrote messages to strangers whose numbers had poured into his phone—Adaeze, who had already left voice notes that were prayer and plan and command; the landlord, who had sent a text with only two words, “I dey,” that felt like a promise he intended to cash; the show’s woman, who wrote, “We are all pulling for you,” and included a crying emoji because what else did modern sympathy look like. The driver shunted the car through a narrow passage between two buses and said, “Oga, no worry,” and for the first time since the call, Kunle wanted to take the phrase with both hands and shake it for lying to him.

He reached the compound and it inhaled him and all his edges. There were more people than there had ever been in that yard at one time; faces that lived behind their doors had come out to learn each other’s names. He did not so much walk as find himself delivered into Bisi’s arms and they held each other with an addiction that had never felt so public and so needed. Her lemon headscarf smelled both like her and like an older fear that did not belong to them. The bed inside, when he reached it, was exactly wrong, and he touched the small folded blanket with his fingers held as if he were blessing or being blessed, unsure which. He wanted to break something in the room and he wanted to sit very still and be water. He did neither. He kissed Bisi’s forehead and then her eyes, where he could taste salt. He said, “I am here,” and she said, “You are here,” and then they could breathe properly for a sliver of time.

The police returned with their questions now arranged differently because the man was here who could supply them with the drama they preferred in their work. The superior one, who wore a cheap wedding band and a small cross on a chain, asked calm questions that sounded innocent until they weren’t. Did he own keys to all the flats. Did he give copies to any assistants. Had he sacked anyone recently. Did he owe anyone money. Had any person owed him enough money to be angry. What time did he tell the neighbors he would travel. Did he post on social that he would be in Abuja. Did anybody new move into the compound in the last weeks. Kunle answered as a man answers when the transfer window closes and everything you can say will be judged as sufficient and insufficient at the same time. He said he had keys, yes, but who didn’t know that; he said the padlock on his key cabinet had not been compromised and he showed the goat-chewed key cabinet with his shaking hands; he said no assistant; he said the only person he had offended recently was the boy who thought noise could be rent; he said he was not a banker; he said yes to posting because the show had posted him and he had been proud as a fool who did not know the price of pride.

The interrogation took a sideways shape when the policeman hinted, gently but with calculation, that sometimes these things were done by family to gain attention or money. The yard made a small scoffing noise that was not quite laughter and not quite warning. Kunle’s head came up like a man walking into a low beam and he said, with his mouth flat, “God will punish you if you suggest it with your whole chest,” and Adaeze, who had arrived like a storm with her sandals not quite on her feet and her hair pins attacking the world, placed a palm on his shoulder to push the heat down. She had already organized a search without waiting for anyone’s okay; church youths had spread out like ants, carrying photocopies of a recent picture of Ire that had been snapped with a flash in a small room, Ire’s eyes big as question marks. People had posted on their statuses. The woman who sold cooking gas at the corner had promised to ask every driver who came to refill. Someone had found a boy with a small radio who had once visited a man who sometimes saw the men who moved children to Sango to sell one thing or the other, and that thread had begun somewhere under the city and was being tugged. At the POS kiosk by the junction, a camera that half-worked had captured something that might have been a small bundle against a chest and might have been a handbag, a person passing between two midnight and one. The shop owner played the footage back on a screen the size of a hand and the room crowded around it like it was the face of God and the policemen went away already planning to use the poor pixels as their excuse.

Social media bloomed the way it blooms—with petals and with thorns. The hashtag somebody cooked in the first hour was called FindIre and it was both a prayer and an invitation for strangers to enter the room with dirty feet. Love arrived in stacks: people offering cars to search neighborhoods, women who had lost children and found them eleven hours later under unrelated beds, men who had seen things in this Lagos they promised you only see in films, all of them writing from spaces that became warmer because they cared. The first troll not even hiding behind cartoon avatar wrote, ‘Where was the mother?’ and another asked, ‘Is this not a stunt for votes?’ and a third said, ‘He is always singing instead of securing his house.’ Adaeze collected those ones in a digital dank bowl and covered them with a rag and refused to show Bisi whose head had already begun to build a room in which to punish itself. The show woman called again and the thing she offered made a knot in Kunle’s throat because in it there was genuine attempt and in it there was the smell of camera. “We can get the host to mention it tomorrow,” she said. “We can put it on the broadcast. It will bring eyes.” He said okay because the eyes might be the eyes that noticed a small face in the back of a tricycle, and then he said not okay because he hated that their life must now be measured in ratings. She heard the twist and, to her credit, did not press. “We will post now,” she said, and minutes later the show’s page had Ire’s picture and words that made his baby into a content square and made him want to pull the internet down with his hands.

His father came at dusk, not as a hurricane, not as a patriarch, but like a man who knows how to sit on a low plastic chair and make that chair something else. He did not hug his son because in some homes men had to learn hugging like a new language, and then they learned it too late. He touched Kunle’s shoulder with a hand that had broken in two places in 1997 and set itself without help. “We move,” he said, and what moved was not anger but competence. He took the policeman with the cheap band aside and spoke in a lower register that made the younger ones look away. He made calls to people who answered because he had once fixed their father’s radio for free and they had never forgotten the sound of gratitude in their own house when the news came back. His mother came and arranged her boubou around her like a small tent and gathered Bisi inside it. She sang a song that belonged to a village that had been paved over by a road, a song with no accompaniment and too many verses, a song that insisted on sleep not as an escape but as an act of faith. Every now and then her voice broke and then repaired itself with spit, and Kunle wanted to put both his hands on the floor to find the pulse of it.

Night turned its face. The room exhaled and held the exhaustion like a baby that could not keep its head up yet. Kunle could not bear the walls. He picked up a torch and went out to the balcony and looked over the edge where people had not stopped rubbing their eyes as if Lagos itself had rubbed pepper into them. Mr. Ogunbiyi, who had lived long enough to no longer learn people’s names before they had proved they would stay, came and squinted at the points Kunle pointed with his light. He saw the scuffed black on the paint and put his finger on it and sniffed at it as if he could tell the brand of shoe by scent. He saw where the vines were snapped—the optimistic fingers that had woven themselves through the railing were broken, some left hanging like bad grammar. “Somebody came from outside,” he said, not because a detective told him so but because the creeping plant told him so. He pointed at the drainpipe that ribbed down the wall like a backbone and at the way a wiry person could slide and hop and get where they had no right to be. On the little ledge below, where no one should ever put their foot, a line of powdery dust had been disturbed into a crescent shape, the shape a rubber slipper would make. He found a tiny thread—a pale thing, nylon—and wrapped it carefully on his index finger like a ring and passed it to Kunle with the care of a man handing over a tiny inheritance. The policeman in the room did not want to be shown this because it would mean writing the words “we saw” instead of “we suspect,” and yet Adaeze, who had found a plastic sleeve from somewhere, slid the thread inside and clicked the flap and looked at the policemen until one of them looked away. The evidence was meager and ridiculous and it made them feel like people again because it was better than story.

The night hawkers spoke to each other across the width of three streets with their specific whistles and, for the first time since they had moved into that compound, Aisha listened not with the affection of a woman who knows shibboleths and codes but with the precision of a spy. “There is a call,” she said, coming into the yard in her socks, whispering. “At around midnight there is one whistle that is not belonging to anybody here. Two long, one short. They have been doing it for days but I thought is love play.” She could map for them which corners answered calls and which corners callers avoided. The landlord harrumphed because men like him did not like to be told there was a system inside their gate that they did not own. “We will fix the security,” he promised, and his mouth made a rectangle on the word fix because he meant wire and he meant camera and he meant maybe a gate with an electronic mouth, but all of that would always be a little too late.

By morning the church young men had turned the search into a mission worthy of bulletin boards. They had printed more pictures on paper that had not imagined itself being useful. They visited bus parks where the air smelled like diesel and shouts, looking for mouths that had seen bundles carried low. They went to chemist shops to ask if formula had been bought by a man with no brightness in his eyes. They spoke to a woman who sold suya and who had noticed a new boy on a new motorcycle ride too fast down their street two times this past week. They went to the carpenter who had stopped coming by because he had changed address in a hurry. Adaeze brought an officer she called “Aunty,” a woman with a sturdy midsection and a gaze that did not wrap itself around stereotypes. She wore no make-believe softness. She took notes like a person who will read them again. She said, “First forty-eight,” and then, to soften, “We will try,” and then, to harden, “Do not touch your door frame any more for now until the scene people come.” She ordered calls to the motor parks. She told the men with the notebooks to go and talk to the man at the water end of the street instead of standing inside the motherhood like tourists. She spoke to Bisi with respect and to Kunle with equal respect and that simple balance made them breathe easier in a way that embarrassed them.

When the sun decided to be hot again as if it had not heard, when the city resumed its noise because what else does a city know to do, a message arrived that was like nothing, just words on a flat glass, and yet it changed the tilt of the room. It came to Kunle’s phone from a number that refused to be born, a string of digits that did not look like anyone. He almost dropped it because his wrists had forgotten about gravity. The message was poorly spelled, the kind of spelling that makes you pity the pen and fear the pen all at once. It said, “If you want to carry your song to your baby again, do not tell police again. We are watching. You will receive call.” There was no sum. There was no name. There was the certainty of someone who had done this before. For a minute the yard made no sound, and then everything tried to speak at once: the mother-in-law wailing softly in a different room that had been given to her for wailing in, the policeman choking on his own advice, the landlord remembering the number of a cousin who had done “things” in Mowe and promising to introduce him like one introduces a sword to a throat. Kunle looked at the words and then at Bisi and then at his hands which looked like tools and like lies. He thought of the envelope in Abuja that had made him into something and then turned back into paper on the hotel floor, and he had one thought that repeated itself like a chorus and refused to fade: I will unlearn light if it brings my child back. He breathed and caught his breath against the barbed wire of the word later, because the message promised later, and it was both mercy and cruelty.

They decided together that they would not tell the men with the notebooks immediately not because they intended to be foolish but because they needed a moment to consider the shape of the trap. Inspector Aunty Ekanem—because that became her name in the compound’s mouth before anyone asked her—said, “They will call. Put the phone on this app that records. We will listen. We will bake our trap also. But do not let them know you are not a fool.” She spoke from a place whose street names were theirs and not theirs. She asked for silence that could cover a river. She told Kunle to answer when the call came with humility and with no sudden movement in his voice. Bisi sat so still that Kunle thought of that evening long ago when she had balanced a tray of oranges on her head to show off to him that she may be a girl from a small place but it was not she who was small. He sat on the floor by the bed, his back to the plywood wall that had suddenly discovered its own thinness, and he pressed the phone between his palms, and he waited for a sound from a far place to come into the little box and reorder everything again, and the song that had unspooled when he ran in Abuja now went back into him, into the pocket where songs live when they are scared of air.The phone lay like a small animal between Kunle’s hands, alive and not alive. The number that had spoken had no country or name, just the cold geometry of digits. He held it as if his heat could coax the next sound out quicker. Bisi sat on the edge of the bed with her palms flat beside her thighs, fingers pressed so hard that part-moon indentations rose in the skin. Her wrapper had come loose and she had not noticed. The room was filled to the corners with people who were trying to make themselves small—Adaeze perched on the stool with her eyes eating every detail, Mama Toun leaning against the wardrobe and muttering into the edge of her scarf, Inspector Ekanem’s notebook open on her lap like a small square altar. The fan beat the air into shape and failed. Outside the window, morning glories trembled in a way that made them seem too pretty for anything that had to do with this night, and on the corridor, feet learned new ways to stand, weight thrown forward as if ready to sprint even though there was nowhere to sprint to.

When the ring came it did not ring; it vibrated in his palm like a fish about to decide if it would die. He glanced at the inspector and she nodded without lifting her chin. He pressed accept and put it on speaker, then changed his mind in a heartbeat and lifted it to his ear because even in a room full of allies there are some things you instinctively protect. The voice that came was a construction site of accents and darkness. It was a man making his mouth small on purpose. He said Kunle’s name wrong and right in the same breath and then said, soft like a threat wrapped inside softness, that this was not movie. He said they could see all of them and he called Aisha woman-of-gate and Chief Ojo owner-that-never-fixes, and Kunle found himself looking at the window as if an eye could appear in the breeze and wink. The voice did not ask for money first, which would have been a relief because money was simple and could be counted even if the counting broke your back. The voice asked for quiet and humility and promised pain in the absence of those. He said proof will come like rain on zinc before the afternoon, and the sentence was constructed the way Lagos men construct threats—figurative, domestic, undeniable. Then he ended the call with a small chuckle that entered the room with the arrogance of a man who believes he can end and begin other people’s days.

Inspector Ekanem had already set the recorder to catch the vowels and the air in between. She scribbled as if the ink could box the man in. She asked if anyone recognized the intonation, if the way the man pressed on the R in “afternoon” belonged to a place, and the yard produced opinions with the speed of rain—somebody said Ikorodu, somebody said Warri in disguise, someone else said it was the kind of English you learn in prison where men teach each other to fear and to be feared. Adaeze kept her eyes on Bisi because there is a way fear takes you out of your body and leaves the body sitting and she wanted to know if Bisi had gone. Bisi had not gone. She was here, and she had decided to stay in the place where her child was last. She stood up and retied her wrapper without fuss, the deft twist of cloth like a declaration that if she must leave the house to go to police or to market or to hell, she would go dressed.

Kunle’s father had arrived with an agbada that had not been aired properly and smelled of mothballs and old times. He wore it because dignity was a uniform and you didn’t go to war in singlet. He looked at the phone as though it were a lazy apprentice, then he looked at his son as though the boy were a tool he had sharpened with the wrong stone. He did not blame; he was not built for that particular domestic violence. He asked Inspector Ekanem a question about the call tracing and did not pretend to understand her speech about cell towers behaving like stubborn goats. He had connections that belonged to another era when connections lived at beer parlors at noon and in the backs of Peugeot 504 cars. He would pull those strings, he said minimally, and he left the room because men like him believed in motion as a philosophy.

The compound developed its own responses the way organisms do. At the gate, the boys who normally sold cards organized themselves into a fragile cordon, eyes hard in a mirror of determination they had seen on the faces of their fathers when the military used to drive slowly past. Aisha brewed tea on a charcoal stove and thrust cups into hands that did not want to remember that bodies needed heat and sugar; she rapped knuckles that tried to refuse. “Drink small,” she said, her own cup untouched, “so that when they call you will not be fainting on top air.” Mr. Ogunbiyi discovered that his old Nokia phone had a flashlight that could stun a rat and went up and down the corridor at intervals like a man patrolling the hallway of his own lungs. Chief Ojo made three phone calls and made noise with each one to remind everyone that they were lucky to have a landlord who could summon men in uniform with a cough; when no uniform materialized, he adjusted and began speaking more softly to the inspector because he recognized competence when it hovered near him.

Kunle found himself doing caretaker work with his mind, moving through the compound’s layouts, thinking of angles he had never thought of: that the almond tree’s second branch was a ladder if you had the unkindness to use it that way, that the ledge below their window had more dirt on the right side than on the left which meant something or meant nothing, that the drainpipe had small rivets missing that would cut your palm and leave a signature. He told Aunty Ekanem this and the woman wrote without looking at her own hand. When she finally spoke to him alone, with her voice lowered in that way that does not exclude but allows privacy to breathe, she asked for the truth about his keys. He showed her the metal box with its goat-bitten corners and the way he had tied the spare key to the third floor flat to a strand of red thread as if color could warn a thief. He admitted that a week ago he had taken all the keys out to oil them because in Lagos you oil everything as if to say please; he had oiled and then, while doing so, had stopped to answer a quarrel over who poured dirty water into whose bucket, and a boy had stood near the key box, and Kunle had told the boy to shift, small small, and the boy had shifted, small small, with his eyes pretending they were not eyes. “Which boy?” Aunty asked, and the face of the boy came, a lanky thing who was new to the fan-repair kiosk near the junction, the one with a scar that looked like a comma beside his mouth and hair that had been coaxed into a shape by ambition. “Bring his name,” she said, and he brought it, and she put the name in her book as she would put a nail in a wood plank.

There is a physics to grief that science does not observe because science prefers reproducibility. One version is the way hours expand and then collapse; noon arrived and took ten years and took ten minutes. The proof that the voice had promised arrived in a message that had no words, just a sound file, and the sound inside it was terrible for being ordinary. There was a baby noise, not even a true cry, a sigh in an infant throat that made the world rearrange itself around it because the world has always rearranged itself around that sound when it is honest. There was a male voice chuckling like someone who had taught himself to find humor in the wrong parts of a book. There was a radio playing somewhere in the background—Kunle heard a jingle for soap, the same soap his mother had mocked, and the irony made bile in his mouth. The inspector pushed her finger down on the phone and the room leaned in as if leaning could move the needle of the universe. “You will wait for instruction,” the text read when the file ended, “and if you call police you will suffer.” The room did not breathe until Ekanem said in a tone both prayer and order, “We are calling no one except the person we have already called,” and she looked around the room to mark who understood that the idiot policemen with thin patience and thinner skills were not the ones to bring into this circle.

Bisi made no sound when she heard Ire’s small noise. She took it and put it in her chest and let it rot and let it nourish because that is what a mother must do with whatever is given to her. She did not cry because crying would allow the flood to come and the flood would carry decision away with the chairs. Instead, she stood and went to the small table and picked up Ire’s comb, a tiny thing with five smooth teeth, and she put it on her lap and passed her thumb along the teeth like a rosary. “We will buy whatever they say we should buy,” she said, and she did not look at the envelope with gold letters that had finally lost their ability to wink.

Money requires making people complicit. The church sent youths into their group chat like flies and money appeared in small sums like kindness being counted in sachets. Adaeze cajoled a businessman in the congregation whose faith was in receipts and he promised an amount that made her remove her headscarf and slap it back on again. The landlord produced cash in the old denominations that suggested he had been keeping it for reasons that did not concern anyone, and he did not specify that this money would be deducted from future rents, which was the kindest thing anyone said all day. Kunle’s father went to the mechanic yard and the boys there, who had once been punks and had become fathers, opened small plastic containers and emptied grease money into his old palm. He wanted to be offended by the wetness of it and then he was not because money is washed in bigger filth every day and still spends. It made a pile that sat on the table inside a nylon bag like a book that taught nobody anything, and Adaeze took a pen and wrote numbers against promises and the inspector pretended not to see because pretending was part of her job now.

The show made its gesture. The host who wore suits that wanted to be cars mentioned the name of a baby on national television, his voice dropping out of its performance register for a second to inhabit something less oil-slick. The camera cut to Kunle’s old audition footage, and at the bottom of the screen there was a number to call and a plea in a font that was too cheerful. Lagos watched in rooms perfumed by kerosene and air freshener and said variations of “God forbid,” and some turned the channel because sorrow in a stranger’s house is wrong noise for a Sunday stew. The comments under the show’s post were prayers and knives and the inspector’s phone began to ring with people who had seen too much and wanted to tell it all. A girl from the next street swore she had seen a woman with a shawl too thick for the heat entering a keke with a bundle that fought. A danfo conductor said a man paid with a torn note and the baby sound that used to make him soft now made him study the man and the man had a hat that did not fit. The inspector listened to all, told her constable to write at least the names, dismissed the urge to run to each corner because running without plan is a way to waste life.

Afternoon bled into something less precise. In the yard, men sat on low stools and women stood with arms folded so that their grief had something to hold besides air. Children were slapped gently and sent inside and then back outside because nobody could remember the angle of normal anymore. A goat that had had one stubborn horn took advantage and nosed into Aisha’s basin and was driven with a shout and the shout betrayed how close the men were to violence. Kunle’s mother made pounded yam with fury, her arms turning the pestle into a weapon, and when the yam was soft as the edge of a pillow she forced the timid among them to swallow it with stew that made eyes water. Bisi ate three small balls of it and felt it go into the blackness and find a corner to hold. She looked at the clock and it was a time that would have been unremarkable yesterday and now had a texture.

The second call came with the hiss of dusk on its edges. The unknown numbers have different timbres, as different as door knockers. This one had a small lag, like it had to cross water to get into the phone. The voice was a different one but belonged to the same factory. He named a figure because men like him enjoy the drama of numbers. It was not astronomical. It was too economical for comfort—an amount a careful person could assemble if they were desperate and half-lucky. Bisi almost laughed because the amount for the return of a life could never be enough to make you laugh without crying. The inspector had told them to ask for proof with each call, and Kunle’s mouth obeyed, and he asked for the girl’s face. The man made a sound like he was both offended and pleased, then a different hum came through the line, a shifting, and the small sound came again, larger than before, a cry that widened into a real cry because babies do not care for your drama. Bisi’s hand closed on the comb so hard that one tooth broke off with a gentle betrayal. The man gave instruction then and the science of instruction is an art these men have practiced. He chose public place but not too crowded, a point in Yaba where Microphones Street meets Bookshop Avenue, a shop that had a broken awning that used to be white. He said a time as if he were telling time to the sun. He said the money should be in a nylon bag that had a logo that everyone in Lagos owns, and he said if he smelled police he would make them sing a dirge. He said if he touched any tracking device he would cut off a small hand and leave it at their gate, and in the room, Aunty Ekanem lifted her hand as if to steady the storm of panic these words were stirring. She signaled, with a calm born in rooms where the walls sweat, that they would go. She pointed with her chin at Kunle’s father and at Adaeze and at one of the church boys who had a face that could be anybody’s cousin. She said no guns because the guns that could find these men belonged to a different station and a different calculation. She said phones on silent. She said do not be brave with the wrong parts of your body. She reminded them that some men perform fear for their own entertainment and you must not give them an audience.

The journey to Yaba had the adrenaline of a matinee. They did not use Kunle’s car because he did not have one, and they did not use a fancy taxi because the men with the menacing voices would be trained to smell new upholstery. They entered a keke because a keke is anonymity, and the driver had the blank optimism of a man who believed his tri-cycle was the piece of the city he could control. The nylon bag with the money had two decoys, one cheap soap and one loaf of bread, because someone had told someone that this protects you against greed. Kunle sat in the middle and stared at the nylon as if it would tell him where to go. Adaeze sat and prayed with a rhythm that would have made a chorus if the day were not cracked. The father sat with his jaw tight and his eyes scanning the road and his hands remembering the weight of wrenches and the places to grab a hot engine so it would not brand you. Inspector Ekanem was not with them in the keke; she had moved separately because separation was tactic. Her people, two of them, were on the ground already, wearing the city like clothes, not invisible but able to become uninteresting, the first skill of their trade.

Yaba has smells that do not leave your nose for days—book glue and dust, fabric and carbon monoxide, cheap perfume and the stale breath of men who have argued for hours without water. It has the feel of a place where information lives in cardboard boxes and on the tongues of brown men. The point he had named was as ordinary as his voice had promised. The awning did not shade as much as it threatened to fall. A man was selling socks like evangelism. There was a boy arranging pirated DVDs as if aligning stars. A woman in a hijab stood by a stall selling pins and her eyes took everything in like a ledger but you could not read the totals. The three of them did not cluster. They made space between their bodies. They behaved like people who have come to buy two pencils and an eraser and to look at nothing. Kunle’s phone vibrated in his pocket and he did not pick until it had vibrated twice because Aunty had said do not show that your life belongs to the call. When he answered, the voice said nothing pleasant. Look up, the voice said, and he looked up and saw the world. Walk two stalls down, buy the chewing gum, the voice said, and he could have laughed because for a second this was a treasure hunt, the kind that children play and adults forget until danger paints it in new colors. He bought the gum from a boy whose lower lip had been pierced and who looked at him with a distance teenagers reserve for their parents. Put the bag down by the stool, the voice said, not gently. Elder people will tell you not to put your bag down anywhere. He put the bag down. Move away, the voice said, and he moved until his back found a pillar that had been painted yellow under which hundreds of men had leaned to remember who they are.

The bag did not sit alone for longer than a breath. Hands are part of the natural architecture of Yaba; they appear and disappear like birds. But this hand was not a bird; it had purpose and it had a fingernail missing on the left pinky, which is not an identity but it is the kind of detail you remember later and wish you had remembered earlier. The hand took the bag and the bag was gone into the belly of the market where men know how to part and then refuse to testify they parted. The inspector’s people moved like the edges of a shadow, not enough to spook a man who expected to be spooked, enough to make a circle, thin as thread. Kunle wanted to run after the bag and the urge pulled his knees forward like fish hooks, and Adaeze’s hand on his forearm was the only thing that connected him back to the instructions he had agreed to. She did not hold hard; she touched him like a woman who had learned to tune the key of other people’s panic. His father stood at the mouth of the lane and looked like an obstruction you will think twice before trying to move around.

Time stretched then, in that competitive way time has when it is trying to see if it can make a man beg. Two minutes. Three. The inspector’s phone pinged in someone else’s pocket. She knew enough not to answer calls that looked like hope until her eyes had looked once round. The call came to Kunle at the exact moment his chest decided to forget how to breathe. Go home, the voice said, and this time there was a smile in it that did not belong to a man who likes people. Do not try to be wise because we are many and you are only one. If anybody follows anyone they will collect tears at the gate, he said, and the grammar of it was accurate and cruel. The keke back felt both too slow and too fast. Kunle sat with his hands in his lap like an old man and stared at the city that would not give up its secrets because the city had learned that the secrets rescued today would be replaced by new ones tomorrow.

At the gate, nothing has ever looked so much like itself and so unlike itself. The same goat chewed a cardboard with the persistence of a debt collector. Aisha looked up with a face that said she had done something while they were gone, some small work that allowed her to keep standing. The room blurred in the edges and then snapped into focus when they walked into it. There was the table. There was the blanket. There was the comb with one tooth gone. There was the inspector, already sitting, because she reappears where she intends to reappear. There was a smell that was new, a smell like floor cleaner that was not theirs, and Bisi’s head came up because mothers know their own smells like they know voices. And then there was a sound, a hiccup wrapped in indignation, a small sound that was the opposite of a bomb and yet had the same ability to reorder a nation. The baby was not on the bed because if she had been the world would have end differently. The baby was not on the crib because that would be a lie. The baby was inside Bisi’s arms with a violence that was tenderness—someone had knocked and left, and in the knock there was fear, and in the leaving there was an instruction to destroy all meaning.

They did not move at first because the body does not trust the world when the world offers you back what it has stolen. Kunle’s eyes did not believe his eyes. He looked at Adaeze to borrow her face and borrow the reality from it. He looked at his father and saw a man suddenly older because relief ages you; it removes armor that has attached itself to the skin. He looked at Inspector Ekanem and saw that the woman had lifted her chin and covered quickly the way professionals refuse joy that has not been confirmed. He reached for his child and Bisi did not release her immediately and then she did because there are two laws in a house—one for fear, one for love—and this was the one for love. He took Ire into his arms and found her heavier than she had been two nights ago because sorrow had fattened something in her. He put his nose into her hair and found everything he had ever lost and did not know he had lost. He murmured nonsense and sense, and the baby, who had been quiet as a fishing line, began to cry, and the cry was a perfect cry with no hidden code, and the room, which had been learning to stay still, began to shake and then held itself still because movement would break this moment into too many parts.

There was a note, taped to the door, the tape cheap, the paper the torn back of a ledger page. The handwriting was the handwriting of men who know only numbers. It said, with a grammatical crudity that was its own threat, “Next time use curtain that is strong. Do not put child by outside. It is easy to collect. We are not your enemy. We did test. Now you have lern.” There was a missing A, and the missing A was a small insult and a big mercy, and Inspector Ekanem read it twice and passed it to her constable with a face that refused to register that this was the end of a chapter because policemen, if they are to survive, must live as if chapters are never really closed. She examined the baby with the consent of the mother, eyes running like a sober scanner over tiny wrists for rope marks, over ankles for bruises, over the soft socket of the neck for hate. There were no marks that the eye could gather as evidence. There was a faint smell of eucalyptus on the baby’s cap that did not belong to any oil in this house. There was the smell of a man’s shirt that had been laundered in a place where people who did not know this baby had hung the shirt outside with other shirts. Bisi wanted to scream at the smell for being on her child; she settled for stripping the cap off gently and folding it in a way that allowed the inspector to slide it into a nylon with the thread from the window, with the photos of the scuff on the paint, with the note.

Relief is not clean. It carries with it the silt that the river picked up when it ran wild. The first thing to come into the room was gratitude, lion-sized and ready to run into the street with no trousers. The second thing was the old fear turning on itself like a snake. Who had watched them and known where to climb and how to eavesdrop. Who had arranged the humiliation and then returned the child with a pamphlet of instruction disguised as a note. The third thing was rage, and it had several faces and one of them was Adaeze’s because she had kept herself from imagining a particular ending and the ending had arrived and brought with it the ugliness of comprehension that there are men who try the door just to know if the door will open. The fourth thing was wisdom, ugly and useful, and it had the shape of the inspector’s mouth. She said, kindly, that the child should be taken to the hospital not because the child had been visibly harmed but because the world had crept all over her body and a doctor could say what backs of ledgers could not. She said to Kunle, in a tone that refused to flinch, that their enemies were not artful criminals from films. They were men who had learned that panic can buy you bread.

The hospital was not shiny, and it was not the kind of place that gets shot in music videos. It was functional in the way of rooms held together by competence and cheap paint. The doctor was a woman who wore her hair in a close-cut twist that looked like discipline and she handled Ire with that mixture of detachment and tenderness that eases mothers and frightens men. She asked for urine because urine doesn’t lie and for blood because blood does not know how to pretend entirely. She checked reflexes with a knuckle and a small light and said words that were not curse and not blessing but lived in the middle with a chair. She told them the truth, that children are resilient when they are wanted, that fear sits in the mother as a substance that will pass or not, that no visible harm had visited here, that the eucalyptus smell was nothing except the sign of the place where she had slept. She did not ask if they would be paying cash or transfer because sometimes even hospitals understand that money can wait. She squeezed Bisi’s shoulder as if squeezing water out of it and said slow down out loud, and Bisi nodded and put her face against the smell of her daughter’s stomach as if this were an oxygen mask.

When they returned to the compound, the yard decided that restraint had been a guest and could now go. People ululated in languages that they had shelved in lockers for years. The goat bleated and head-butted the generator as if agreeing with the mood. Children spilled out from wherever they had been exiled, eyes bright the way eyes are when they have brushed near a story. Somebody set fireworks off that were really sparklers and a policeman almost shot them and then did not and then laughed at himself because Lagos laughter is the last defense. The landlord tried to organize a thanksgiving on the spot and was defeated by the number of people who wanted to lead prayer. Kunle found his body horizontal on the bed, his shoes still on, his daughter asleep in the curve of his chest like a question that had been answered and would need answering again tomorrow. Bisi lay with her back pressed to his side and her face toward the wall because the wall was the place a woman faces when she has to remind herself that walls are not omnipotent. She slept and then woke and then slept in small beads.

Night does not stop coming because it is ashamed. It came again with mosquitoes putting their greed to song outside the net and with boys telling each other that they had learned something today about doors and women and ropes. The inspector sat on a plastic chair outside and drank tea as if it were whiskey. She had taken off her wig and her scalp glistened with competence in the corridor light. She told her constable to photocopy the note so that if and when the original was “lost” by evidence men with absolutions, she, Ekanem, would own the truth. She called a number and requested respectfully and then with the flatness of a woman sure of her authority that the low-level criminals who rode at midnight near this street be told that this compound was not for games. She did not trust that system either, but all systems must be worked like tires—kick, test, roll, change.

Kunle woke with a start because the body has its own alarms and stands up inside you to knock you when it has had enough. He could not sleep further because sleep felt like giving permission. He looked at his phone, and there were three texts and a missed call. Two texts were from the show people, framed in tasteful grief and corporate promise, the way they had rehearsed in meetings; one said take your time and the other said press will be waiting to hear your statement but no pressure and contained a pressure that made his nose itch. The third text was from a number he did not know. It said, “Congratulations. You will hear from us again.” He sat up in the dark, his heart finding new ways to beat. He remembered the note that had been stuck to his door and the grammar and the arrogance. He realized that the men who had taken and returned may not be finished because men who can pull and release you like a puppet do not lose the taste for the strings in one use. He stood, careful not to wake Bisi, and went to the window. He opened it a crack and put his ear to the night and heard the city not sleeping, and he understood suddenly that there was no canvas large enough to hold everything he felt, and because he is who he is, he began to hum under his breath, not a song of victory or lament, but the kind of song you hum inside your mouth when you are a man trying to teach your breath how to remember.

The news ran like water collecting itself and then running to lower ground. People who had prepared to be sad deleted their sad messages and wrote new ones that celebrated God loudly enough to annoy people who had not been paying attention. Someone wrote an article that called it a miracle and left out the part with the money because citizens prefer miracles that do not cost. Another wrote that Lagos men should stop showing off with their travel announcements and care for their wives and bolt their windows, and a quiet fight started in the comments like rash. The show’s producers sat in a room and argued with good intention on their faces and market share on the table, and one of them said, “We should call him on stage next week to sing to his baby,” and another said, “We should never call him again lest we make the boy into a mascot,” and none of them were wicked; they were simply working blindfolded inside a room with cameras.

Adaeze was back home after midnight with her sandals off at the door without thinking, which is how you know a girl has made a home in your house. She sat on her bed and cried for the first time because other people were asleep and she could afford it, and she cried for the ways women must carry fear like a baby on their back in the market and still price tomatoes with sharpness. She cried for Kunle and Bisi and the way men will now measure them by this thing. She cried because the sound of the baby in the audio file had taken root behind her rib and she could not find the right shovel for the soil. When she was done, she wiped her face like someone finishing a task and sent a message to Kunle: “I know the song to sing on Sunday. And I will not let them steal your voice and leave you with silence.”

Morning conspired with routine to insist on itself again. The almond tree drooped exactly as it had drooped in all the other mornings, a green tiredness that the wind refused to cancel. A hawker calling Agege bread sounded both like yesterday and like all the mornings in Nigeria. The generator coughed and refused to start until Aba mechanic slapped it in that particular way that is not in manuals. Children ran diagonally across the yard because children always prefer diagonal. The police came back to take statements as if statements were a new kind of currency and they were rich in paper. Inspector Ekanem stood slightly apart from them, in uniform but not like them, and when she spoke, they listened as if she had moved half an inch closer to their stomachs, and when she left, after promising to return, the yard watched her as one watches a neighbor who might become family.

Kunle held Ire and sang nonsense and sense in equal measure. He smelled her hair again and discovered that the stranger smell had already begun retreating under the assault of their own air. He looked at Bisi and found new lines around her eyes that were not lines but maps. He said nothing about the message that said “You will hear from us again” because saying it would give it teeth. Bisi said, into his intention, that they would move the bed away from the window, that they would buy a stronger curtain, that they would hang a tin bell on the latch the way women in her mother’s place did because tin is cheap and noise is priceless. He nodded because this was action and action is the spiritual opposite of despair. He knew he would never again think of light the same way. He knew the stage in Abuja had been a river that he had crossed and that now there was a different river. He knew he had to call the woman with the headset and tell her he would not be available for a while, and he did not know if that would be a brave thing or a poor thing. He decided, without deciding out loud, that he would not be ashamed either way.

Around noon, a boy with a comma scar by his mouth and hair that had been coaxed into a shape by ambition presented himself at the gate and asked for caretaker with his voice flattened into ignorance. The landlord who had rediscovered his own gatekeeping stood with his chest delegating and asked the boy who he was. The boy, whose name was now living in Aunty Ekanem’s book, said he had come to ask about the key-making job. He had a story about his mother who had fallen and a younger sister whose school needed security money. He had eyes that had trained themselves to look open. Aisha, who had grown up with brothers who could fold truth into tiny shapes, narrowed her own eyes imperceptibly. Inspector Ekanem, who had the gift of appearing to be invisible when she chose, was already at the back of the crowd, and she shifted her weight onto one leg and wiped imaginary sweat off her top lip, and she watched the boy’s hands because hands have less respect for lies. The boy’s left pinky had a missing nail, and in the yard, a memory stood up like a man who had been sitting with his back to the wall. Kunle did not notice first. He was inside with Ire and a song. His father noticed because his life had trained him to notice how things glinted when they should not. He made no sound. He went to the inspector and coughed a pretext cough, and the inspector said casually, “Come, help me carry this bag,” to the boy who had come to ask for keys, and the bag, which was very light, gave her an excuse to say, “Your hand is brave,” and to touch it, and in that touch there was a slide of her eyes to the left, and in that slide there was a plan that would require the yard to remember which way to stand and which way to look away.He came into the yard as if he had been invited by the air itself, head dipped, mouth neutral, the way Lagos boys walk when they do not want trouble to recognize them by their posture. When Inspector Ekanem said, “Come and help me carry this bag,” he grinned without teeth and stepped forward the way boys do when they think they are being chosen for a small luck. The bag was nothing—a canvas thing with a zip that had lost its last tooth—and she held it with her fingertips like a woman who did not know the worth of a thing she could lift with two fingers. He reached and took it and she praised him with a small mmh that could pass for gratitude. Her eye, which did not blink when it should, saw the missing pinky nail in the way a trap sees the leg it is meant to hold. She let him carry the bag to the mouth of the staircase and, without changing her tone, asked him his name. He gave a name that matched the one in her book as if fate were tired of being subtle. He asked about the key work with a small hunger in his voice, the kind of hunger you learn before your first beard.

In the background of their exchange, the yard behaved itself with the discipline of a congregation that has seen miracle and is careful to make no sudden movements that might offend heaven. Aisha leaned on the gate with an arm that looked tired by design, her eyes counting every person who passed the road and every gesture of the boy’s hands. The landlord found a broom and swept a place already clean because the enactment of normal was his contribution today. Kunle, inside, did not know which way his bones wanted to lean; the old impulse to step to the gate and put his chest in front of anything that could be trouble wrestled with the new law that said your child is worth more than your theatre. Bisi, holding Ire, could feel the tremor in the air and closed her palm around the comb with four teeth and whispered into the baby’s soft hair the kind of prayer that is neither request nor thanks but a tying of rope around two living things.

“Sit small,” Ekanem told the boy, and gestured at the low stool near the doorway, the one whose cane had been mended three times and still showed its scars like decoration. He sat, his knees open in that careless way of youth, his eyes doing the geometry of escape routes as if it were multiplication. She handed him a plastic cup of water and he drank in quick honest gulps, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and in that wiping she saw the small white line of the missing nail again and pressed the detail deeper into her mind as if she were pinning a cloth to a line with a stubborn peg. “You will write your number,” she said, and she brought out a dog-eared ledger—the caretaker’s old book where tenants signed for water drums and gate keys—and put a pen on it. He bent to write, holding the pen as if writing had always been a negotiation with his fingers, and the letters he shaped into his name looked like they had forgotten school and learned market. The lowercase g dipped like a sad ear. The t stood too straight as if trying to salute. She did not smile at the memory of the ledger-back note; she let her face remain that of a woman who was preoccupied only with a small job. She asked him what corners he knew, and he laughed modestly like a boy pretending competence and listed places that were both obvious and vaguely wrong for his story—railway line, back of the new chemist by the canal, the kiosk that sold fans and occasionally phones of unclear origin, the side of the carpenter shed where men dice paper in the evening. When the call she had been waiting for vibrated softly in her pocket, she let it ring twice and then, over his head, she signaled with her eyes in the direction of the gate.

Her plain-clothes man, who had been standing for twenty minutes pretending to be interested in the way goats choose plastic to chew, shifted without anyone being able to say what had moved him. He drifted out into the street where the sun had laid itself lazy across puddles and motorbike exhaust, and found another of her people leaning against the blue kiosk, scratching his head as if calculating the price of soap. The plan was not a plan you could write in neat lines. It was a net thrown into water with trust that the fish inside were more foolish than the man holding the rope. They needed the boy to leave with confidence and be followed without knowing he was being followed by men who had learned to walk without appearing to land on the ground. If he ran, it would not be heroism to catch him. If he turned and asked, “Who are you?” with the boldness of boys who are already owned by men, they would become other things—men buying recharge card, men arguing about ball, men asking the price of second-hand shirts.

Kunle’s father coughed into his fist the cough he had invented for conversations that need to change direction, and he floated to the edge of the scene as if pulled by a current nobody else could feel. His eyes did not leave the boy’s fingers. He had worked with hands his whole life and he trusted them more than he trusted mouths. He saw the small neat scar under the left wrist, not a fight scar but the kind a wire makes when it has been coiled too tight and then sprung back, and he filed it away the way old men file away insults to examine later in the evening when memory makes a small fire of its own. He did not tell Kunle what he had noticed because he had learned that some information rests better in the palm of a stranger wearing a badge than in the ear of a son whose heart is already a broken plate.

When the boy rose to go, he did it with a practiced slowness, the courtesy of someone who had been taught not to show eagerness when negotiating for money. He promised to return in two hours, to bring samples of keys he could cut on credit, and he gave a small speech about how he was a boy who did not like trouble, who liked cash rather than story, and who was grateful for the opportunity because opportunity is a bird. He looked at the baby as he spoke the last word, as if measuring her weight, and in that glance something untrained crossed his face—regret, or curiosity that had not known it would be dangerous to be curious about tenderness. Then he stepped into the street, became part of the movement, and was gone the way coins disappear inside trousers with holes that you refused to patch.

The inspector’s men peeled off in different directions as if they had seen a signal that did not exist. One went after the boy directly, head low, phone to ear, moving at half tempo, the way men who are waiting for news walk to keep from believing they are useless. Another took the parallel street, the one with the baby clothes stall and the woman who charmed men into buying socks with jokes that belonged to beer hours, trusting that the two streets would meet like gossip in a corner where eyes did not reach. Ekanem herself did not follow; she stayed in the yard and asked for patience because sometimes the job is to hold the center while others go to the edge. She collected the plastic cup the boy had drained and dropped it into a nylon with a noise like rain; later, she would give it to someone who measured the world in oils and skins and would translate the film of saliva into story. She tore out the ledger page and slid it under a newspaper on the table the way market women hide their money under Bible pages; her constable, who had only ever arrested men who stole phone chargers, watched and memorized the casualness with which this was done.

Kunle came to the doorway finally because the wind had learned his name and called him once, twice, and he could not ignore it without insulting old gods. He stood with his shoulder against the doorframe and watched the inspector sit as if sitting were action, and his chest behaved like drums that had been struck by different drummers. “We will not chase,” Ekanem said before he could ask, and her eyes did not leave his face even though her ears were leaning in the direction of the road. “We are walking with them. Running is for when the ground is clean.” He nodded because the sentence made sense in a part of him that did not read instruction manuals. He could feel Bisi behind him like a stripe of warmth and he ached with the desire to catch this day in both hands and shake it until it gave up all its names.

The tail went the way tails go when they are professionals in a city that prides itself on sniffing out professionals and selling them to the highest bidder or the nearest cause. The boy cut left where the gutter wore a smell like insult and climbed a small stepped ledge that had been constructed in a hurry by a mason whose wife needed money to buy wrappers for burial, and then he turned back to glance, and the glance was neat and quick, and he counted three men who had been behind him and now were not, and he nodded to himself like a student who had guessed the answer correctly and changed the subject. He went past the stall of the woman who kneaded rubber slippers into shapes to sell to men who believe foot pain is a tax, and he ducked into a lane where laundry hung like flags of a country that had never agreed on a color. The man following him took a beat and then a breath and then entered after him, using a small group of schoolboys in overstretched uniforms as a shield because children are invisible and contagious; nobody looks at the man who looks like a teacher separated from his class. The second tail cut a different path, emerging at the far end of the lane at a kiosk that brightened water with sachet light and pretended it did not sell recharge cards for betting even though the walls were a scrapbook of men holding knives in their mouths and squinting.

They saw the boy pause by a woman with a red basin of garden eggs, and the woman did not sell him anything but she extended one egg as if offering it to air, and the boy took it and did not bite, and he put it in his pocket, and some code was exchanged in that grossly innocent transaction, the kind of code that would seem like superstition if you wrote it in a report and took it to a superior who did not leave his sedan often. He went past the old cinema that had closed as a cinema and reopened as four churches, each louder than the last, and he touched the rust on the railings as if checking to see if rust was still there. He crossed the road without apology, and the keke driver who nearly met his shin with wheel shouted a long curse and then, seeing the inspector’s second man near, swallowed the last half because even Lagos curses are pragmatic. The boy entered a yard that was not his by birth, a yard where the gate leaned like a drunk who wanted to quit but did not know how, and he did not knock. Inside that yard, a woman sat on a low stool plucking feathers that had not learned they no longer belonged to a bird, and she did not look up, which is not the same as not seeing. The boy went straight to a back room with a curtain where men sit when they are trying not to be seen and want to be heard, and that was as far as the tail would take it today because there are rooms you do not enter without names on your tongue.

Ekanem’s phone made a noise that she had chosen deliberately to be unremarkable, and she lifted it and listened and closed her eyes the way people do when listening becomes the same as thinking. She asked one question that required only yes or no and received neither; her man told her with breath where the boy had gone, and she pictured the yard and the road and the ways out, and she knew it would be springtime for idiots to storm now. “He is going to the shed,” she said aloud, and Kunle, who did not know which shed, knew exactly which shed because there is always one place in a neighborhood where a thin line connects men, money, and fear. She turned to him with a face that had kept many mothers from doing something they would never forgive themselves for. “We will not touch him now,” she said, and the we was so large it almost had a roof. “If we drag him here, they will kill him with mouth and stick, and he will become a lesson you cannot use to learn. If we let him walk, he will lead us to the mouth that chews and spits boys like him. Choose patience and I will owe you one, caretaker.”

He wanted not to choose patience. He wanted to press his thumbs into the boy’s collarbone until the collarbone confessed its all. He wanted to empty all the good words he had learned in church and on a stage into the gutter and fill the gutter with his old blood. But he also wanted the person who had said “You will hear from us again” never to have another evening where the sentence applied. So he chose the version of courage that sits down instead of stands up. He sat. He watched the almond tree draw a shaky picture of shade on the floor. He felt Ire’s breath on his forearm and counted it in fives because five is the number of fingers the child wraps around your thumb when she is interested in life.

Bisi moved the bed while nobody was looking because doing was an anaesthetic. She dragged it six inches away from the window with the silent violence of a woman who has decided not to ask permission from a door. She took the tin bell that her mother had pressed into her palm once upon a time when she was a girl dreaming of city and tied it to the latch with thread that looked flimsy and held like oath. The sound it made when she tested it was small and fierce, the kind of sound that tells a thief the house speaks. She opened the trunk at the foot of the bed and took out a cloth her grandmother had sewn with a pattern that had only been made in one year by a man who died the next and shook it open and spread it on the bed as if it were a protection, and in a way it was because memory is a trap that sometimes catches evil when your hands are busy holding your child.

The show called and called again because shows cannot help themselves. The woman with the headset used a softer voice than she had been born with and asked after the baby the way an aunt would ask, and then she asked a question that she had been told to ask by people who paid her to ask, about how Kunle would like to speak publicly now, not for ratings, of course not, but because his story had grown bigger than their stage and people wanted a face to pour their feelings into. Kunle listened, his ear remembering the weight of hotel pillows, his throat remembering the processed coolness of air that was not Lagos, and he answered with words that did not burn with accusation or melt with gratitude. He said later like a man ordering a meal he could not yet name. He asked them to stop posting Ire’s picture, to take down the square that made her face available in a million thumbs’ habitual cruelty, to leave one thing that belonged to him in a world that had taken to borrowing the rest. The woman hesitated because teams had already built slides and planned a segment, and then she said yes because sometimes saying yes to a man who is holding his baby is the least thing you can do to be human.

The men returned at dusk with faces that were shadow and dust and the particular shine that comes to men who have held their breath for longer than is good for gods or lungs. They had not entered the room with the curtain, but they had seen who entered and who left while they stood purchasing the air and pretending to look at nothing. A small man with a large earlobe had gone in and come out three times with different shirts; men who change shirts to change their nature are men who think they can talk to luck in a different language each hour. A woman with wrists too thin for her gold had entered with a bag and left with a different bag and had not smiled, which is a story. Two boys none of them knew had stood outside and pinballed glances to each other; they were either decoys placed for pantomime or recruits too new to know better than to wear suspicion as if it were perfume. Most importantly, an older man had arrived on a bike that was only noisy when he wanted it to be; his face was ordinary in the way men in television try to teach policemen to spot. His ordinary was art. He looked at nothing and saw everything and went in once and stayed the right amount of time for a person who was both important and afraid of being told he was important. The inspector filed the shapes of these men into her internal cabinet and labeled them in chalk, knowing she would have to change the labels once she had learned their real names and their real crimes.

“Not today,” she told the yard, because the yard had gathered enough rumors in its mouth to spit a mob. “Tomorrow, or the day after, or the day after that when they are convinced they are not being watched by anyone but God. We will take the man with the earlobe, or we will take his wife if his wife is his ledger, and we will lift the whole mat to see the sand under it. But not today. Today you will hold your child and your temper and you will cook your food.” She spoke like a woman who had learned to walk the road between police and people without breaking her ankles, and a low murmur of acceptance ran around the yard like a small lizard testing new sun.

Adaeze went with Bisi to the kitchenette and cut okro with practiced quickness, letting the knife find its own dance. She did not talk about the boy because talking would flatten him into story and stories are too small to hold what must be done. She talked instead about the choir’s new song and the way Sola had gone flat and pretended not to notice and how she had clicked her tongue and Sola had found the note again like a child finds his way back to his mother’s wrapper in a crowd. Bisi laughed with her mouth closed and the laugh was medicine appropriate to the patient. She asked Adaeze if she was hungry and Adaeze said she had swallowed air all day, which is not a diet she recommended, and they ate in small mouthfuls because fear sits beside hunger and whispers too loudly.

Night carried in small visitors with it—men who would not usually be brave enough to enter another man’s yard to offer condolence sat on the plastic chairs and said the simplest thing in the simplest way: “God did.” It was not theology; it was punctuation, an attempt to put a stop to a sentence that threatened to run on until it emptied everyone. The goat fell asleep beside the generator with its head on the warm metal as if conceding that this was a day for unusual softness. The landlord cut a new key and held it up like a trophy and promised to change the locks on the downstairs door by morning and to put a new light over the stairwell that would burn with the fury of a young landlord. He did not mention rent once, and in this way he began a new chapter in his tenancy with his tenants.

Before sleep would agree to visit their room, Kunle stood by the window with Ire on his shoulder and sang in the most selfish way a man can sing. He did not sing to comfort Bisi or to make the yard believe in God. He sang to charm the air into forgetting the shape of the men who had breathed it yesterday. He sang to make lines inside himself straight again, to line the walls of his chest with noise that belonged only to him. He sang low enough that only the morning glories would be witnesses, and they swayed like partakers. He stopped and in the stop there was a large silence that made room for a small whisper—Bisi’s voice saying, “We will move this bed again tomorrow,” which meant, in the language they spoke under all the languages, we will live.

At dawn, which is not actually a time as much as a mood Lagos adopts and discards like clothing, the inspector came back with a plain cloth wrapper strung across her chest like she had borrowed the day’s softness. She did not sit. She did not pretend to be a visitor. She told Kunle’s father that the man with the earlobe had a habit of visiting a particular suya spot on Wednesdays and that men with habits make policemen faithful. She told Kunle that the boy with the comma scar had a mother with a face like dust and a brother who wore too much cologne to hide the smell of glue, and that sometimes the pity you feel for the boy must be placed carefully where it will not water the seed of wickedness. She told Bisi to keep the cap with the eucalyptus smell because smell is testimony even when men lie. She told the landlord to put a second bolt on his own door because landlords behave as if their height protects them and their height is mostly talk. Then she said, in a voice that belonged in kitchens and not in stations, “Eat well today. Choose your tiredness. The city will ask for more later.”

Kunle went to the church that afternoon when the light slanted in through the asbestos like a blessing with holes. He carried Ire because he had decided that if the world insists on seeing your child as argument and ransom, you must insist on showing her as miracle and lunch. Adaeze had set up two microphones and moved them away again because sometimes mics make people perform and today she wanted truth without echo. The choir trickled in, ashamed of their own relief, and sat without the usual skirmishes over who would lead which song. Pastor Joseph put his hand on Kunle’s head and prayed a prayer that avoided the word “hedge” for once and leaned into the word “keep,” which in Yoruba holds more meanings than a foreigner would assume. When it was time to sing, Kunle did not pick the easy ones that work like buckets on congregations. He opened the drawer in his chest where a certain line had been folded and he sang the whisper Bisi liked, the whisper designed for rooms but shaped now to fit a hall. He held the first vowel longer than any musician who respects television would ever allow and in that length the church remembered that breath is a revolution. He sang about bells made of tin tied to latches and about how God sometimes is a neighbor with good ears and about how safety can be a woman’s hands. When he finished, the applause did not try to be applause. It was the sound people make when someone returns from a place no one should go and they did not go empty.

On his way back, the city moved aside for him and did not know why. Boys at the junction hailed him with the particular affection they keep for men whose sadness has made the news. Women selling tomatoes asked after Bisi as if she were an aunt they had visited during holiday. A bus driver cursed a taxi and then, seeing him, softened the curse into a suggestion and grinned to show he meant nothing by it. He bought oranges and the woman added one extra and said, “For the child’s leg,” which is a nonsense kindness that Lagos recognizes as medicine. When he reached the gate, he saw the inspector in a way that told him she had been waiting on purpose, and his stomach tightened the way a man’s does when he hears a doctor say his name twice.

“They will call again,” she said without greeting, because greetings waste luck. “Not because they want money this time. Because you are a man with a stage and they have found out that stages scare fear or fatten it. A group like this will want to attach themselves to your voice like lizards to a hot wall. They will ask for protection money, but they will not call it that; they will call it contribution, or remembrance, or they will say they kept you safe and demand to be thanked. They will threaten embarrassment not harm because men who trade in panic know that shame is a currency that spends faster than blood.” She let the words sit like bricks by his feet and did not try to arrange them into a neat wall.

“What do I do?” he asked, and it was a small sentence, a thin one, that looked too frail to carry the weight placed on it. He was not asking as a singer or as a caretaker. He was asking as a man who had discovered there were rooms next to his room that had always been there and had not been named in any of his childhood stories.

“You do not pay,” she said, not like a hero giving a speech, but like a woman telling a child not to touch a pot. “You do not answer unless you are ready to answer forever. You let me and my tired boys follow your shadows and catch them where shadows go to drink. You keep your child where your hand can reach. You teach your yard that gossip is a gate with hinges squeaking so that anyone can push. You do not leave your window talking when you are not around. And you—” she paused and softened in the place where professionals soften if they intend to remain human—“you sing when you need to breathe. Not because music is magic. Because breath is.”

In the evening, when a wide pink smear sat badly on the sky as if the day had applied rouge in a hurry, the boy with the comma scar walked again past the compound at a distance that said he was measuring something that did not belong to him. He did not look in. He scratched his head with his right hand and then his left and his head did not itch. A keke slowed near him and the driver lifted his chin like a man counting coins with his neck. The boy bent and said a sentence into the driver’s laugh and the keke drove on. He placed his palm on the wall as if the wall were a person whose temperature he wanted to gauge and then he took it off and shook it, a small shake, as if something had burned. On the wall, when Aisha went out later with a rag and a bucket, she saw the faintest dust print of five fingers, the pinky shorter, the nail absent, and she washed it gently the way a woman washes off a curse and expects the curse to heed soap.

When they finally lay down again, the bed now a respectful distance from the jealous window, Kunle put his face in the groove where Bisi’s neck becomes shoulder and found there the scent that had called him once from a church doorway and promised him that he could choose goodness and survive. He whispered into it because the baby had slept and the house had decided to believe in itself for tonight. He did not promise triumphs. He promised smaller things—keys on hooks, a bell on a latch, his feet in the corridor in the morning to sweep dust into obedient piles. He promised to call his mother and take the stew pot she offered even if he did not want stew. He promised to tell Adaeze thank you without teasing and to stand a step to the side when his father began a story so the story could see its way through. He closed his eyes and the city closed one eye with him and kept one open because Lagos does not do both.

Far away, in a yard with a curtain that had been drawn and drawn again, the man with the earlobe sat with his shirts in a heap beside him and counted money that did not belong to him out loud because men like to make sound when they make the world bend. He licked a finger between bundles and his tongue tasted faintly of eucalyptus and cigarette and the dust of paper. He told a boy to bring more garden eggs and told another to stop loitering by the gate like a sentence that refuses to end. He said the name “Kunle” once as if trying it on for size and found that it fit his mouth too easily. He smiled, a small thing, and his smile collected the room like a broom collects corners. In another corner of the city, a policeman Ekanem did not trust reported to a superior Ekanem distrusted completely and sold a story for the price of suya because corruption is not always an anthem; sometimes it is a long habit that you hum under your breath. And in the house with the bell and the new distance between bed and window, a baby exhaled and stretched, the ordinary holiness of it filling every crack, and the morning glories inched toward the night as if to ask it a question that would make tomorrow hesitate before it answered.Chapter Nine

The first morning after the bell made its small metal argument at the window, dawn arrived like an apology nobody had asked for. The corridor smelled of soap and fried oil because Aisha had decided sorrow needed akara with pepper, and the tin bell made a thin sound each time the breeze pushed the latch as if to remind the house it had a voice now. Kunle woke with Ire’s breath on his chest and watched the dust make its own soft weather in the square of light beside the wardrobe. The bed had been moved, the space at the window felt like a rectangle where something had been decided, and even the wall seemed to be standing straighter as if flattered by having been asked to carry a new kind of weight. Bisi rose with a quiet that was not caution but concentration and retied her scarf in a swift motion that had always given him a sense of being inside a life where small skills could trap storms. She did not ask if he had slept; both of them could smell the answer. She bent to place her nose in Ire’s hair the way old women smell kola nut to be sure of the occasion, and when she looked up there was a new steadiness in the set of her mouth, something like a woman who had moved a bed and would move other things if they needed moving.

The message that had said, You will hear from us again, had sat in his phone like a coal all through the night, too small to burn the house down and too hot to ignore. He had shown it to nobody because saying certain sentences out loud gives them a spine, and the inspector had already said not to feed beasts with attention when what you needed was a trap. He washed his face at the corridor basin where the tap sputtered and spat before agreeing to be generous and he watched his father at the far end of the corridor acquaint himself with the morning like a man who had found an old tool under a pile and wanted to see if it still fit his hand. The old man tilted his head toward the bell and lifted his eyebrows as if to say, now you are speaking my language, and Kunle, who had much to ask and very little he was ready to say, felt a thread pull taut between them and did not mind the ache.

Later, after a breakfast that tasted more of relief than of plantain, Pastor Joseph came by to leave a prayer that walked around the room and touched the corners like someone visiting an old house they used to own. He carried the suggestion of a radio show like an egg in a palm. “My friend at Salt FM has asked,” he said, his voice careful, the words shaped not to fall against any sore place, “if you would speak small. It can be your voice—soft, not this crowds. People will listen and pray, and sometimes bad men feel eyesight on their neck and misbehave less.” He saw Bisi’s jaw tighten the small amount a jaw tightens when it wants to protect the part of the face that smiles, and he added quickly, “Only if you want. There’s no blessing in brandishing a wound.” Kunle thought of the stage, how sound becomes a thing you can trip over if you don’t own it, and he thought of the inspector’s mouth saying, Choose patience and I will owe you one. He asked for an hour to decide, and Pastor Joseph nodded as if he had expected that hour and had saved a chair for it.

In the yard, Inspector Ekanem stood in ordinary clothes that did not let the morning know they were police. The sun made a glittering joke of her wedding band and she twisted it once the way people draw strength from circles and then let her hand fall. She told Kunle and Bisi and the landlord and anyone who could stand and listen that Wednesday would be suya man’s day for the man with the earlobe, that there are patterns you can count on when arithmetic must be done quickly, and that the boys were watching with the half-bored, half-hungry focus of men who have learned to be patient by failing at it. She did not romanticize the odds. She said somebody had leaked their small plan yesterday evening to someone for beer money, and in saying it her eyes flicked not at her men but toward the road, as if to remind the road that betrayal is never indoors only. “We will pour in false news like cheap gin and see who comes to drink,” she said, and Adaeze, who had come to borrow a kettle and left with a list of instructions to pass to the choir boys who were suddenly deacons at largeness, agreed to carry this rumor like a bread you don’t mind sharing too much of.

Her rumor was simple and sweet enough to tempt: that the caretaker had collected cash from the show people and had stored it in a box beneath a bed because banks are too modern for real life, that the show had promised more if he cried on air, that in two days there would be film crews at the gate. It was the kind of lie that villains found hospitable because it gave everyone a role and asked nothing hard of imagination. By noon the rumor had slid down three streets and put its feet up at a pepper soup joint where men who had nothing to do with each other shared bones and secrets, and a man with a loose ear listened with a face that did not know faces and scratched his jaw as if listening made hair itch.

Kunle’s mother arrived with a pot that set the kitchen glorying. She wore a wrapper that had learned her gait and a blouse that announced the color of a ripe pawpaw and she came as if the corridor belonged to the span of her arms. She placed the pot on the table like a drum and opened it to let the steam stand and say its prayer, and in that steam was ogiri and thyme and the scent of a home not confused into fancy. She kissed Ire’s foot and then her forehead and then her chest, and the order made sense to a logic bigger than superstition. She did not sit until she had rearranged chairs from where the landlord kept them for show into positions where conversation could rest its elbows. “Eat,” she said with the authority of old love. “Eat what is yours before the day takes it.” They ate, and the stew was like a story that had been told so many times it had found its perfect speed, and Kunle’s father cleared his throat in a manner that predicted a story.

He told it without drama because drama is often the enemy of admission. He told of a time when he had been young and flammable and had looked the wrong way at a man who looked the wrong way back and how a radio had been taken from the shop and returned with a note that said, “Now you know if your locks are joking.” He told of how he had wanted to turn the street into a lesson and had been taught instead by a policeman who had said, Low man will take your bait and get beaten while high man buys bread with your anger, so keep your anger for the high man or save it for your roof when it starts to leak. He did not apologize for the ways he had stood on the wrong side of his son’s songs. He simply said, “This city loves to see which side of you is breakable,” and in his mouth the sentence tasted like old pepper.

At Salt FM, the studio air was cold with the modest confidence of machines. The room had a glass window that turned people into fish and an engineer with a hoodie and a patience that had probably saved many shows from collapse. The host was a man whose voice lived in most kitchens in Surulere and on the verandas of people who needed noise to separate the day from the memory of night. He said Kunle’s name softly, like the key in a keyhole that does not want to disturb the sleeping, and he did not do the performance of sympathy that fools the footage. He asked small questions and let silence do the large work, and he did not bring out Bible verses like a vendor producing wares unless the guest wanted it. Kunle spoke in the way you speak to a cousin you respect but cannot be sure is not gossiping—measured, with disclaimers braided into sincerity. He did not talk about the men, who were many and few at once, and he did not talk about the note, which could grow third legs. He talked about bells and beds and the way a street hears more than you think, and then, because the host asked, he sang one line without accompaniment. The line did not belong to any chorus the Christian stations loved; it had dust and laugh and market in it and an old Yoruba word that had slipped into prayer like a thief and found a home. The engineer lifted his head, and the phone lines lit like fireworks that had learned obedience, and somewhere in a room where earlobes are not a metaphor, somebody turned the volume down and frowned.

When the call came that afternoon, it came dressed as friendliness and carrying an invoice for gratitude. The voice was new but belonged to the family of the old voices, and it congratulated Kunle with a sweetness that was salt in a small cut. The man said their association had labored on his behalf, and in this city men who kidnap children like to call themselves associations because crime prefers corporate. He spoke of safety like it was a service plan and said nothing about babies because babies complicate receipts. He asked for a monthly contribution, light, not to burden, to ensure that his house would not be bothered by lesser men who might see his new celebrity and confuse it with permission. He did not call it protection money; he called it neighborly arrangement, and his tone suggested the request had more to do with culture than with extortion. He named a sum that would annoy but not ruin a careful family, and he mentioned a place where the first envelope could be dropped—under the third concrete bench at the back of the football pitch, where boys kissed girls and pretended they were not kissing girls. He added that if they chose embarrassment instead, there were pictures and stories and the kinds of recordings that made people laugh at mothers, and the word “mother” left his mouth with grime on it.

The anger that rose in the room was clean and white-hot, the kind that burns fast and leaves clarity behind. Before Kunle’s mouth could open, Bisi’s voice reached the man with the courtesy of a knife kept in a sheath. She said, “We will not pay you to teach you that we are citizens. If you wish to be embarrassing, we have already been embarrassed and we did not die.” The line went quiet for a brief, theatrical second, and then the man laughed the way some men laugh to make their mouths bigger than they are. He said they had time, that Lagos is a patient city if you feed it well, and then he cut the call with a hum as if he had just remembered he needed to be somewhere more important. Inspector Ekanem, who had been standing with her back to the curtain watching the light count itself on the floor, did not clap and did not scold. She looked at Bisi with a respect that made the other women in the room stand taller by a finger’s breadth. “Now they will test other doors,” she said, and she pulled her notebook to her lap like a shield.

Wednesday became a creature made of meat smoke and long shadows. The suya spot was a claim on evening that the whole street acknowledged; even the mosque on the corner seemed to pause its insistence for a split second when the first spicy smoke went up. The men who watched wore faces they borrowed from other places—downcast, indifferent, distracted—and the boy with the comma scar slouched through with a swagger sewn by fear and stitched by practice. Ekanem sat with her back to a wall that had been painted a white that Lagos had chewed back to gray and sipped kunu from a plastic cup as if this had always been her Wednesday. The man with the earlobe arrived late, the way men arrive when the world has not punished them for tardiness, and he dismounted from a bike that made more sound than it needed to and less sound than a conscience. He bought meat in a quantity that suggested either appetite or patronage and did not look around except once, and the once was for the purposes of ritual, not information. A child broke from his mother and ran at the wide road with a determination that would have pleased a football coach and killed him if the okada man had not had quick hands. The earlobe man’s left hand shot out, as if his elbow were listening to something his eyes could not see, and he scooped the child’s shirt and pulled him back so cleanly the boy barely knew the day had changed shape. He did not smile at the mother’s shocked gratitude and he did not scowl at the boy’s protest; he returned to his meat and dabbed the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand, and the city wrote another sentence under his name that said complexity is not goodness.

They did not try for him that night. They dusted the rear fender of the bike with powdered chalk that would make a white fingerprint on a cloth if the cloth leaned, and one of Ekanem’s men followed the bike at a distance that was an argument between fear and experience. The bike led them to an area with streets that did not obey their own names and a cluster of rooms that used to be shops and had been folded into homes. The bike entered a space that swallowed sound and company, and the man on it dismounted and his shoulders took the shape of a man who was now inside his own river. The tail stopped where he was supposed to stop and watched, and the information gathered was not enough to feed a raid and too much to ignore. They brought it back and placed it on the table between yam peels and prayer and Kunle’s father’s cough and Adaeze’s sharp eye, and all of them leaned without touching as if touch would make it scatter.

Toward the end of that week, a photo arrived like a slap administered with fingers trying not to tremble. It came to Kunle’s phone and to Adaeze’s and Pastor Joseph’s and to the landlord’s niece who lived in Ifako and to the church boys who had turned themselves into patrol. It was Ire sleeping, one hand upturned as if offering a small coin to a dream, her mouth open in that perfect O that babies make when a new breath surprises them. At first glance, it was a picture from their life, harmless, banal, the kind of picture you send to a grandmother so that a Sunday afternoon has meaning. Then the background shifted itself into hardness. The cloth behind her was not any cloth in their house; it had a repeating pattern of little combs in blue and lime and the kind of golden border market women favor when they plan to sell you a thing by its shine. Aisha made a sound and put her hand over her mouth because her mind ran faster than propriety. “That pattern,” she said through her fingers, and she looked at the inspector, whose eyes had already found the same pattern in a different place—the barbershop two streets away where the owner’s girlfriend had brought a cloth of that exact persuasion and hung it as a curtain nobody needed, a brightness inside a room that had always preferred male gray.

By evening a basket of names sat on the inspector’s lap. The barber’s girlfriend’s cousin sold data outside the pharmacy and always wore his cap crooked to a degree that suggested rebellion had an angle. The barber himself had a neatness that made you think of men who do not intend to get caught doing anything messy. The girlfriend had an aunt who did hair and a brother who had moved, as they say, to “up country” and returned with a phone he could not explain. The boy with the comma scar had been seen leaning at the shop door with the air of someone who thought leaning could be a degree. “We will go early,” Ekanem said, and her voice did not pretend early makes the world kinder; it only makes it easier to surprise.

That night the compound had visitors it did not want: a dark sedan that stopped too near the gate and smelled of office, and a man with a face used to putting names in paragraphs and then taking money for the arrangement. He said he was press; he had a card that was laminated and a camera with an injured strap and a smile that had not learned the difference between intimacy and intrusion. He tried to enter the yard as if he had paid for it by arriving, and the landlord, in a rare act of pure public service, blocked him with his stomach and said that the house was fasting from cameras. The man laughed and then he did not laugh when Inspector Ekanem turned her head and pinned him with a look that understood the laws his editor had given him and refused them. He left after twenty minutes, but not before he took pictures from outside the gate and asked a neighbor if he could interview her goat. The neighbor refused and the goat bit the air like punctuation.

They went at dawn when the city looked like it had been washed and hung on a line. Ekanem wore her uniform because sometimes you must announce yourself to make men behave, and she carried a quiet authority that looked like someone’s elder sister come to collect what was hers. Her men moved with the economy of people who had been told they would not be paid overtime because the budget had died. Kunle did not go. He stayed because men who want to be everywhere often end up in the wrong place at the right time, and because Bisi said in a tone that sounded like a vow that she needed him to be the one to hear the bell if it sang. He kissed Ire’s forehead and her feet and the place behind her ear that smelled like milk and new days and he stood three steps from the door with the impatience of a bird that has decided to carry a tree.

The barbershop was not the stage for a film, and nobody rehearsed their roles. They knocked first out of courtesy and then they knocked as if courtesy were a ruse and the barber’s voice came from the back, thin and then thick, saying someone should wait, he was not decent, which is a sentence men use when they are buying time. They did not wait. They entered and the girlfriend’s face attempted a story and failed, and the cloth with the small blue combs became suddenly shy and tried to be something else. The boy with the comma scar was in the chair with a cape around his neck and foam at his jaw as if he thought mimicry would grant him innocence, and he began to laugh in the middle of a sentence and the laugh did not know where to go. The inspector said, “Good morning,” and it was a morning and it would have been rude not to greet. She asked the barber to cut the machine and he did, and in the silence after the blade whir stopped, the city slid nearer to listen.

They did not find a shrine to wickedness. They found phones that had been kissed open by many thumbs and a bag with five caps that smelled faintly of a eucalyptus brand you buy near the railway line and a package of nappies that had not been opened and could have been purchased by any man trying to be a hero to a woman when he had messed up elsewhere. They found the little cloth with the combs and took it carefully as if it would bite. They found the boy’s right hand tells—nervous cracks at the knuckles, a tap-tap on his thigh that counted without his permission. They found the girlfriend’s eyes, which had the watery welcome of someone who had been taught to keep men’s mistakes alive with her tears. They did not find Ire’s smell, because the house had been cleaned with a roughness that was itself confession.

“Who is the elder?” Ekanem asked, her voice a stone skipping across the surface of a pond, and the barber, whose hands had been trained to give men clean lines on Friday nights for years, blinked and thought of lying and then saw in her face that the cost of lying had just gone up. He said a name that not many on that street had said aloud because some names, when said, become doors. He said the name of the man with the ear, the one whose long earlobe had always looked like an invitation for luck to pull. He said it the way a man says the name of a market he has been overcharged in and still returned to because it was the only market for miles. He did not put drama on it. He put a small shame on it and kept quiet.

They took the boy and the barber and the cloth and the phones. Ekanem did not cuff anybody in the yard because cuffs are a song for neighbors and she did not feel like singing. She spoke to the girlfriend with tired kindness and told her to come to the station later, to bring her aunt if she needed a wall to lean against, and the girl, whose wrists carried gold as thin as the breath of a lie, nodded and looked at the floor because the floor is a good place for a woman to put her fear when it is still small. Outside, the boys friends scattered like seeds that will become trees on another street. The inspector’s men did not chase them because men who scatter carry gossip like pollen and Ekanem intended to plant the exact rumor she needed in exactly the soil she wanted.

She returned to the yard at noon with sweat pressed into her collar like an extra badge and passed Kunle without speaking into the room where the bell hung. Bisi stood and her lips brushed the inspector’s cheek before either of them could pretend not to be human. “We are going to catch him,” Ekanem said, no drum in her voice, no church, just the plainness of someone who had seen men walk into rope with their own legs. She looked at Ire and the child looked back with those eyes that had no idea of how the world had arranged a meeting in her name. “If we don’t catch him,” she added, and the room held its breath for the second half of that sentence, “if we don’t catch him this week, we will put an itch in his life he cannot scratch. He will cross the road and the road will remember us. He will sleep and dream of a bell.” She smiled then because she understood that promises must feed on something more than anger to live.

That afternoon, the show called again, the warmth in their voices tired because corporate kindness has a shift. They wanted him to come on stage Sunday and sing that whisper line again, to let the nation finish the story the way stories prefer to be finished when the camera is a partner. They spoke in the language of platform and healing and the social, and he stood in the doorway with the phone to his ear and watched Bisi fold cloth and tie the new bell-thread one more time and he heard the inspector laugh with his mother over something that would have embarrassed both if they had been younger women. He told the producer he would come to the studio later in the week and sit on a stool and sing with a guitar that was not tuned and talk with the host who had a voice that made people put their spoons down and listen, that he would do it on his terms and not in a place where light wanted to be the main character. The woman on the other end sighed like a person swallowing a pill and said they would think a different thought then, and after the call ended he stood with the phone in his palm and felt, more than thought, that there are roads a man walks because he has feet and there are roads a man walks because he has already walked other roads and must learn not to return to them like a fool.

By evening the yard felt as if it had inhaled and not yet exhaled. The goat had found a way to escape its rope and was now head-high in the garden bed acting sophisticated, and Aisha had stopped bothering and had declared the goat a tenant with arrears. The landlord had found a vendor of motion-sensor bulbs and was giving a lecture about the future of lighting to anyone who dared to pause two seconds too long in front of him. Adaeze had brought her mother, a woman who wore her head tie like a medal and her mouth like a gourd for blessing, and the two women greeted with the kind of pleasantry that heals nothing and oils everything so that things can move without breaking. Kunle’s father sat with the boy’s ledger entry and his jaw clenched not with anger but with a memory that had refused to sit down since the suya smoke blew in his face. He told Kunle in a voice with no corners that when the inspector took the earlobe man, if she took him, there would be noise that would pretend to be community, and that he should prepare not to be loved for a week by people who wanted to practice disappointment.

Night came with a stubbornness that reassured and threatened. The bell ticked at the latch when the breeze turned and coughed, and every time it did, Bisi’s fingers loosened around her panic slightly then tightened again because bodies practice. Kunle lay awake a long time in the dark after the house had surrendered to the possibility of sleep, humming that thread of a song that had first found him when he was poor and his mother had used her comb as a metronome. He thought of a man with an earlobe that the city had chosen to flatter and a boy with a comma carved on his face and a policewoman who wore competence like perfume she did not want anybody to notice. He thought of his father’s clumsy story and his mother’s stew and Adaeze’s knife on okro and Pastor Joseph’s small radio voice and the host at Salt FM and the coldness of that glass that had made him feel like he was in a fishbowl people were tapping. He thought of light, the kind you choose and the kind that chooses you, and he let the hum fall away because silence is a song too if you listen to it with enough honesty.

Before the sun acknowledged their street, someone knocked on the gate in three polite taps and then a fourth impatient one, the rhythm of a person who does not live here but comes often enough to know the etiquette. It was one of Ekanem’s men, shoes white with dust that had pretended to be fog in the early hour. He did not come inside and he did not say good morning at first because greeting steals seconds from the messages that need breath. He said they had a window and it was small and he said the words bike and earlobe and shed and he said them with no adjectives. He nodded at the inspector who had been in the yard five breaths later without any of them having noticed her arrive, and she nodded at Kunle as if to ask him to carry their silence for them while they went to interrupt someone else’s. She told Bisi to tie the bell string a little tighter because wind had fingers, and Bisi nodded and did it with a neatness that could probably make a thief cry.

The day began to boil behind the mosque, and the muezzin’s call threaded itself under the hum of generators that had not yet owned the morning. The city stretched and the almond tree shook itself as if to get rid of whatever the night had insisted on leaving on its leaves. Kunle stood with Ire and watched Inspector Ekanem walk toward the road with her shoulders set at that angle that says: we are not asking today. He felt something like a drum begin in his chest, not the old performance heartbeat or the newer fear, but a third rhythm that belonged to men who are learning to live in houses where bells are not ornaments. He did not ask for triumph and he did not promise to remain gentle. He kissed his daughter’s hair and said, “We are here,” and the words did not feel like magic and they did not need to, because magic is sometimes a lie you tell your fear when all you really have is a door, a bell, and your hand on both.
